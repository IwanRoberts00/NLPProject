As there was a lot of confusion about the name of the medicine you

So anyway
No no see here I didn't expect her to

people made arrangement for me

With some three or four different rooms and one kitchen and
hall one word and all that
I see
So immedietly after two days I was made comfortable
 for my 
 So you got to cook your own
Yeah I could cook my own food actually even the
kitchenware and everything was there
Very good 
So I didn't have any problem in Lancaster
 Haan 
So the whole of uh May went off well 
Very good
But the moment I went to Holland for a day and went 
return to London
Oh 
In London you know they put me up in a uh international
hall
 Haan 
And there they were uh serving breakfast and even the
 dinner

And was all included in the payment
 Accha 
So if I didn't eat at night and went out outside and
some how but in anycase I couldn't eat much
 Oh you should one word and one word 
 
 Haan 
But some how it was all over
 Haan haan 
So then uh 
So how are you ?
What what how are things one word 
Well going on and so you your trip
was very good it seems
Yes I think 
 And did Leech remember me very 
 Oh he did yeah he did actually
many other people remembered your presence there
 Yeah 
Who else did you meet ?
Ah there was Dick Alright I don't know what two words
Yeah yeah Dick Alright was 
Around
Here in Bombay haan 
No
Does he remember me ?
No I don't know 
May be and then you know I contacted uh Tomkin 
Ah Allan 
 Allan Allan Tomkin I telephoned ah
 and I even he even wrote to me
 Ah 
 Haan 
Because I I was to get some books for the Maharashtra
Board
 Haan 
S S C Board
 Haan 
Actually I have ordered books 
 Haan 
At the last moment haan I
thought you know actually it was difficult to get all the books in
one place
 Haan 
Right 
And so there there is a special E L T shop 
 haan called Kelse 
 Haan 
Yes Kelse is very one word 
catalogue yes yes
 In London 
Oh then actually you know that is the place from where you
can even directly order things
 Haan 
He told me
Yeah yeah 
Ah even if you ask for a direct mail order uhm
 we will supply
 Uhm 
 Accha 
Anyway I have paid and ordered books for S S C Board
 Haan 
And he promised to send it at a cost of very marginal charge
I see
Yeah 
So many jobs many assignment laughs 
Oh I know 
How was the S S C Board meeting ?
Did you go to this uh meeting on fifteen 
 Fifteen yes ahn ah Kadepurkar
 see we were we carried work home and this glossary and all that
 Ahn 
Uhm 
Finally there were other changes some rejection
Uhm uhm 
And uh unfortunately there was no electricity nothing you
know uhm 
There was a total breakdown
 Uhm 
Oh I see
We were to continue the next day
 Haan haan 
But then there was this holiday and one word strike
Really
So even the S S C Board people were going to be
away
 Uh 
Oh I see
So it was the meeting went on upto five O'clock in
that sultry heat 
And then we I returned home means in the evening 
 Haan haan 
Was there any any decision about another meeting uh ?
Yes eighteenth July is the what you call the first
language
 Haan 
Then third or fourth July the third language
Third language and uhm this did that uh Apte lady
come 
Yes she came
 Haan haan how how did
She of course she was very quiet probably she was
just getting to know things
Yeah haan 
And uh she didn't look that one word type 
 yes that uh 
 Yes 
Yeah yeah 
I was made to believe she would be 
 Worry oh or worried okay
Uhn well uh everything was fine 
 I think I think she is not bad 
No anyway I don't have to work with her
I know
I will be in other group
I know
But even then she didn't seem to be one of those one
word though she has lot of weight to throw around 
No doubt no doubt I mean may be she has
 She is 
She is physically very fat 
 Laughs 
I see is it
No you haven't seen her 
I have seen her but I've normally may have
 may have put on some more weight in the meanwhile
 Oh she is quiet bulky yeah 
No no no 
Because it is almost two years since I saw her three
 or two or three years
 Three 
Ahn 
Because I I am one of those unfortunate people 
 haan who have been responsible for uh awarding Ph D
to laughs so many 
 Haan 
 Ahn I see
Actually I looked into her thesis also
Oh I see
And that must have been three years ago
 Haan because I see 
 And I had gone
I felt a lot of consolation looking at her size
 laughs 
Come on
And so she has a lot of weight to throw around and she did
 laughter 
She was good ah and then uh I see some
passages were rejected
 Ah 
Ahn 
And then 
 From the ones which we had already taken
Yes yes and then some in some cases 
Kadepurkar you know see another thing is he is conducting the whole procedure
in Marathi 
 Oh how unfortunate 
Oh God 
Not being audible to half the audience oh it
was not it was a messy affair
 Oh 
Oh I see
So I was telling
And wasn't Gokhale there 
Oh he was there
Ah ha
But he did a good job whatever you had assigned
to him 
 I think yeah I think he is
We had a session of passages and he had look through
Ah ha
And uh 
 Wa wa was was there more material forthcoming 
I'm I'm just e e e 
Ahn yes yes of course material did come 
 Haan haan 
So we have made a fresh selection in the meantime Michael
West dictionary has come
Very good very good
We all got a copy
Oh I am glad 
Yeah 
Ah
So the now we are meeting on the evening itself 
 haan with some more material
 Haan 
Alright
And then I told Kadepurkar look 
 Haan 
We are not going to look at the material one word 
endlessly
 Haan 
Now you make a final selection and we will start working
No no I think that snag is somewhat there
 Haan 
That you know I have I have diagnosed the case but I have got
to haan do that unfortunately no 
 job of coordinating in the sense that people pulling in
different direction 
 Haan 
 Haan haan 
It looks like one word 
Like you know the Board people ahn want to
assert their whatever you know
 Ahn 
It looked like it and they are not able to
select
 Yeah 
No no they want to assert there right alright but then uh
 I mean I not all not many of them were really academically uh
capable of you know isn't it ?
Yeah
I don't know really
Yeah it's all the you see uh uh what you call
 one word was not very wrong
Yeah 
But the way she went about was wrong 
 That's right
Anyway yeah the point yes uh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
But then we have to somehow manage the show 
Exactly
So I I maybe you know atleast in my presence 
they somehow seem to agree to many of the things that I 
You know one word it looks like that 
This time people were opposing 
I know 
And uh my group is not so bad
Yeah 
Except that Lalita Ghatge everytime she brought a piece 
 uhn it was one word down to L three 
 Uhn 
Oh really
But she said why don't you all one word include me
in L three istead of doing this 
 Haan 
I am doing other peoples work ahn she was
annoyed
 Ahn 
Actually that may be a good really because the small
 one word you know ahn and if she can really be
of use to L three 
 Ahn 
But it doesn't two words material production I don't
know 
Yeah what she is capable of
Ah yes but you know the whole problem is except
Wakankar in that group uhm nobody else really knows the job
 Uhm 
I know I know 
Wakankar has been a school teacher
Yeah yeah
He has uh actually been in the field
 Ahn 
Uh in our case uhm we have something
called common sense
 Uhm 
Uhm
In our group
Oh oh then
 A few words yeah we may not have the
experience uhn but we have common sense
 Yeah yeah 
 Uhn 
Uhn 
Now your uh gentleman Kulkarni didn't turn up 
Oh I see 
Yes he didn't turn 
 He must have had some problem yeah
 yes I think somebody was ill
 One word 
 Haan 
He wrote to me in London
 Two words he I think his one word
 
 He had gone to Bombay yeah somebody was
ill and unfortunately she died also actually a relative of his
 Oh I see 
I see
And there you know a relative was in London and I was to
go and see them 
I see 
May be anyway yeah 
 That may the reason
I mean in any case I I mean last meting atleast I
thought he had got some material and they were accepted
 Haan 
Ultimately you know somebody has to do the job anyway
 let's see
Right
Uh what else how are you ?
Oh otherwise theek hai then uh uhm you
know two words 
How is that you take the whole thing 
 And she asked me no no she is waiting
for a letter from the Board 
I I
She asked me did I read letter and uh because 
one word he came on the fourteenth no next day
 Yeah 
Right
On thirteenth
Right 
So Raj Rajni's brother nothing was right
Ahn I know 
So I said probably it was read at the Board level
Yeah
So I said anyway I'll find out
I asked to Pradhan
Uhm 
So that he watch over there that letter was really 
presented
Uhm
So he said whatever we want to tell her we will write over
there atleast she must have received but she hasn't received anything from
them
Oh 
Was the letter read ?
Yeah letter was read and actually discussed every point was
 uh actually mm sort of taken haan 
and ultimately this uh see people felt that there is no point in uh 
uh you know discussing everything
 Haan 
 Haan 
We just stick to the old decision that she drops out
and there is an end of it 
Yeah 
So you know
 Haan
