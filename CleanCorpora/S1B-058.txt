the recommendation of 
""
""
Uh next 
""
""
It is good thing that the government has extended the stay of
doctors 
""
""
But the main point is why this 
has suddenly appeared in our country

Whether the government  origin

And what steps  in order to assess the
 and also

But the government did not take

Thank you
""
""
Honourable minister 
""
""
Sir  as soon as we got the report of the plague occurance
in the Beed district of Maharashtra  the
government of India has taken all possible help sending  expert and
medicine and all support to the  uh respective state government to control
plague sir 
""
Sir about the  occurrence of plague in our country sir we have
 medical scientist
Dr Ramaswamy Lingam
""
Sir uh  Ramalingam Swamy
and they they are requested to  have a detailed study
and give report  report within six months sir
""
About about the  uh memorandum submitted by Surat I I don't have
any information about that sir 
""
""
Second supplementary please 
""
""
The main cause  and we
recently we had recurrence of malaria also in some parts of the country 
""
So the health of the country is going down  and
the government has not taken any steps
""
But the main point I would like  ask the minister is
 though it was cleared up
in the 
""
But subsequently it was stopped 
""
It is due to lack of financial resources with municipalities 
and government has taken up evolved a plan  to
clean up this garbage so that such diseases do not occur in future
""
Any plan of action is being contemplated by the government 
""
""
Sir  the garbage problem all over the country specially
the municipal corporation are all over the country sir  and this municipal
corporation administration come under the State governemnt sir
""
We are in contact with the state government to take appropriate
action  their city sir
""
And and that part we have  informed the State government
""
Sir not only the plague there are 
other  in any
city or in any municipal  directly under
the State government
""
But we have  told the State government to take
appropriate action so that there should not be any 
it is upto the State government sir 
""
""
Mr Das 
""
""
Sir  one of
the causes 
""
And there is piling of garbage everywhere 
""
Now the honourable minister says  that it has advised the
municipal corporations 
""
But the point is 
""
plague 
""
But right to health is a normal human right 
""
Without passing on the path  me
 Health ministry of
Union government shall make available  for the use
 for cleaning of
the garbage 
""
Of course political garbage cannot be cleaned 
""
That is different 
and for this the honourable minister let him say whether he is in a position
to make allocation for additional funds  plague and malaria
can be eradicated
""
Nowhere in the world it is coming up 
""
But in India  again we are getting
""
What about the funds ?
""
Will you make available 
""
Will you make available  will you make available additional
funds  to the municipalities and the State
governments 
""
""
Uh Mr Chairman sir 
member's 
""
As 
""
The states have to provide necessary funds  for the maintenance
of the public health facilities  the diseases which
affect the common man 
""
Now the question question  put the question about
providing funds to the municipalities 
""
To help them  which is lying there
""
""
Sir as I said earlier  we have been in constant touch with the
State governments 
""
We have requested the state Chief Secretary then the health
Ministers 
""
Basically  health
authorities local self governments 
""
They are the local authorities 
""
They have their own 
and it is necessary they have to make necessary provisions that
""
But by saying that  to
come into the aid of the 
""
The honourable member had said that  its nowhere in the world
""
""
But information in the house I can quote  where plague is
taking the toll of the people in  interruption
""
""
I don't think I don't think I will be able to pacify the honourable
member but I  given the information for the
""
""
Sir uh 
Uganda  in United States of America
""
""
In the United States of America 
""
In United States of America  in Asia Turkistan
Mongolia Myanmar  and some other countries in the world have deliberately
not shown that it has though there is plague 
""
So 
interruption 
""
""
Please 
""
""
Sir 
""
""
Please 
""
""
There would not be any more permanent conclusion  then the
honourable member is 
""
""
Sir 
""
""
Please please  so that
I can go to another question
""
""
Sir but one thing which he has spoken about me personally 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I would like to inform the member not to the house 
a few words 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
That I won successively seven times parliament  Lok
Sabha 
let him not teach me the lessons of integrity
""
""
 to all
our concerns in a country 
""
But what a havoc more is sir  alone in
publicity 
""
So that 
""
Most of the foreigners 
""
Because of that 
""
Yes 
much the pre-media has caused much havoc to the economy of the country 
""
Under these conditions we should make the foreigners know  that
the actual epidemic is not in the magnitude which is published  for that
what has the government to do to contained the press to go  publishing
like uh this alarming magnitude
""
And also in future also such thing should not happen
""
For that what  you see the question is
what  and also in
future to guard 
""
""
Yeah thank you
""
""
Thank you sir 
""
""
Unfortunately the media overplayed  the plague situation
in the country 
""
Even when the world health authorities  came here to certify
that the quick actions and very effective actions have been taken by the
government  the media didn't
support unfortunately 
""
 that we have not done the job
""
We have done the job  world over we are being
praised  in very quick way
""
""
Mr Swaminathan 
""
""
Recently I had occasion to meet the  the
world renowned 
""
They had a conference in  at about during the
time of plague 
""
And in that conference they have concluded  it was not plague at
all 
""
The disease was not plague at all
""
It was a disease just stimulating plague  and originally because
these people have found out and report to the press it was plague  they
have been consistently saying it is the plague
""
He had also also given me a paper 
""
For want of time I couldn't go through it completely 
""
Well the minister is aware that there is another idea that the
disease is not a plague  and
because originally it was said by some authorities it was plague they have
been consistently saying that is plague 
""
""
Sir 
uh our communicative diseases sir uh  they said it is plague
""
""
And it is clarified by the 
medical scientist also have supported
""
""
I K Gujral 
""
""
The  honourable minister is right
""
""
Just a second just a second I am  just
after this
""
""
In addition to what my colleague said sir
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
The honourable member wants to know  about the terms of
reference of this committee I think  interruption
""
""
""
Yes yes yes 
""
""
 financial matters will he look
""
""
Because not  because primarily that is the agency to do
something that is why I want that there is nothing  like that in the sense
of the  two
words 
""
That the terms of reference records  is to elucidate factors
responsible for the current outbreak of plague  plague and infact perhaps
it includes what it say 
""
I say  will they will the committee
""
""
Whether whether whether it is for want of financial fund that
also the committee can look into it
""
""
Alright then your  and you write
to the committee that you can go into it 
""
I will be happy
""
""
Shree  I K Gujral
""
""
Sir uh 
underplay 
""
 not a question of propaganda
""
 whether it is so many cases more
or less
""
Issue basically is  and I hope my honourable friend knows that
not once not twice not three times 
there are any number of reports available  and you do not need one more
expert to make it  to tell you that that is no municipal committee in the
country  which is financially
viable okay 
""
Now the point is sir  are
going by the plan  obviously
government I assume I hope 
 And therefore may I ask him , has he thought and approached , , the the
planning commission or something , that the structure the municipality has to
be increased No.(1)
""
No.(2) Sir, has the honourable  thought in terms
of improving the sanitation methodology and technology because it doesn't
need a WHO report to tell us that our seat is updating
""
It doesn't need any health organization that we see filth around
""
They will first collect garbage on the road side and then we
remove it
""
And therefore all along disease is  This incident
of plague whatever dimension I am not discussing has brought up and despare
at home
""
May I ask him if he is believed to undertake apart from the
committee  to avoid the situation
""
Has the cabinet I wrote to Cabinet myself the prime  one word
 and the ministry of urban
Development
""
Have the ministry of Urban Development and ministry of health set
together to evolve the comprehensive scheme to see that our health and
sanitation improves? Swaminathan Sir the honourable member is right  one
word  what he said about the maintenance of sanitic conditions in the
limits of municipality
""
It doesd need atleast throught and a coordinative approach to
solve this problem not only the health ministry
""
This is by the ministry of Urban Development, local ministry, the
state ministry and the local authorities concerned
""
As far as the  necessarily we have to find a way
and in that direction we have to consult the the planning commission and for
that
