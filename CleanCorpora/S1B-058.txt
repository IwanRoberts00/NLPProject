 ( a) Whether it is a fact that twenty-four odd doctors who had
been on plague control duty at the Indira Gandhi international airport since
October first nineteen ninety-four were on duty till twenty-ninth
November nineteen ninety-four more than a month after the 
World Health Organization declared that plague was no more a
threat in the country and ( b) 
 If so the details and reason for retaining the team at the
airport for such a long period 
Sir question number two zero two ( a) and ( b) I have
check at the airport they were continue even after plague was fully
contained to alliviate the apprehension of the other countries as per as
the recommendation of World Health Organisation 
Uh next 
It is good thing that the government has extended the stay of
doctors at the international airport on the advice of the 
 World Health Organization 
But the main point is why this dreadful disease or epidemic 
has suddenly appeared in our country 
Whether the government have necessary impact of the origin
and impact of the plague why it came suddenly ?
And what steps government has taken in order to assess the
 epidemic and uh the loss of life and property and also
 what steps have been taken on the uh recommendations for uh 
memorandum submitted by the municipal union of uh Surat which said
 in the wake of floods in Tapti river and the wake of large amount of
garbage piling up there they advised the municipal authorities and
the government to appoint number of uh extra staff to clear the
garbage 
But the government did not take
What steps the government had taken to review the causes
for this disease and its eradication ?
Thank you
Honourable minister 
Sir as soon as we got the report of the plague occurance
in the Beed district of Maharashtra and subsequently in Surat sir the
government of India has taken all possible help sending expert and
medicine and all support to the uh respective state government to control
plague sir 
Sir about the occurrence of plague in our country sir we have
 appointed a committee under a renowned sci medical scientist
Dr Ramaswamy Lingam
Sir uh Ra interruption Ramalingam Swamy
and they they are requested to give their have a detailed study
and give report report within six months sir
About about the uh memorandum submitted by Surat I I don't have
any information about that sir at at present 
Second supplementary please 
The main cause for the occurrence of plague and we
recently we had recurrence of malaria also in some parts of the country 
So the health of the country is going down like this and
the government has not taken any steps
But the main point I would like to ask the minister is
 this piling up of garbage in municipality though it was cleared up
in the first days after the occurrence of plague 
But subsequently it was stopped 
It is due to lack of financial resources with municipalities 
and government has taken up evolved a plan to provide finances to
clean up this garbage so that such diseases do not occur in future
Any plan of action is being contemplated by the government 
Sir the garbage problem all over the country specially
the municipal corporation are all over the country sir and this municipal
corporation administration come under the State governemnt sir
We are in contact with the state government to take appropriate
action to clean up clean up their keep clean their city sir
And and that part we have informed the State government
Sir not only the plague there are ot 
other it is a very unhealthy scene to have one word in any
city or in any municipal uh uh area sir and and it is directly under
the State government
But we have uh uh told the State government to take
appropriate action so that there should not be any one word but 
it is upto the State government sir 
Mr Das Shri Guru Das Gupta 
Sir the cause for plague is piling up garbage one of
the causes 
And there is piling of garbage everywhere 
Now the honourable minister says that it has advised the
municipal corporations to clean the garbage 
But the point is import important 
 point is they are all all the diseases are reappearing 
plague malaria cholera they all reappeared 
But right to health is a normal human right 
Without passing on the path I could I let me ask me
 the honourable minister whether the government Health ministry of
Union government shall make available additional funds for the use
 of the municipalities to take emergency measures for cleaning of
the garbage 
Of course political garbage cannot be cleaned 
That is different but the other garbage is to be cleaned 
and for this the honourable minister let him say whether he is in a position
to make allocation for additional funds so that plague and malaria
can be eradicated
Nowhere in the world it is coming up 
But in India again we are getting
What about the funds ?
Will you make available funds to the municipality 
Will you make available will you make available additional
funds for this particular purpose to the municipalities and the State
governments without just issuing a circular 
Uh Mr Chairman sir I can appreciate the honourable 
member's concern for health to the people of this country 
As the house is aware that the health is a state subject 
The states have to provide necessary funds for the maintenance
of the public health facilities in eradication of the diseases which
affect the common man 
Now the question question two words put the question about
providing funds to the municipalities on emergent basis 
To help them to remove this garbage which is lying there
 almost in all the municipalities of the country 
Sir as I said earlier we have been in constant touch with the
State governments 
We have requested the state Chief Secretary then the health
Ministers to take necessary steps in this regard 
Basically the municipalities or the local health
authorities local self governments 
They are the local authorities 
They have their own powers they have their own funds 
and it is necessary they have to make necessary provisions that
But by saying that we will not avoid our responsibility to
come into the aid of the maintenance of the health of people 
The honourable member had said that its nowhere in the world
But information in the house I can quote where plague is
taking the toll of the people in the other country interruption
 
I don't think I don't think I will be able to pacify the honourable
member but I am have given the information for the
 benefit of the house 
Sir uh in other countries in Africa Madagascar 
Uganda Zaire in South Africa Peru in United States of America
In the United States of America I don't a few words 
In United States of America interruption in Asia Turkistan
Mongolia Myanmar and some other countries in the world have deliberately
not shown that it has though there is plague 
So it's not that only in India plague is there 
interruption 
Please minister is answering completing his answer 
Sir there would not be any 
Please 
There would not be any more permanent conclusion then the
honourable member is a few words 
Sir interruption 
Please please please tell the answer the point so that
I can go to another question
Sir but one thing which he has spoken about me personally 
Yeah
I would like to inform the member not to the house in 
a few words 
Yeah 
That I won successively seven times parliament Lok
Sabha elections noise on public one word 
let him not teach me the lessons of integrity
 A few words and it has caused much to all
our concerns in a country 
But what a havoc more is sir the publicity alone in
publicity in one word improfessional magnitude 
So that it caused havoc in the economy of the country 
Most of the foreigners refused to come to this country 
Because of that our tourism income has also come down 
Yes in so many ways the ma the process has caused 
much the pre-media has caused much havoc to the economy of the country 
Under these conditions we should make the foreigners know that
the actual epidemic is not in the magnitude which is published for that
what has the government to do to contained the press to go publishing
like uh this alarming magnitude
And also in future also such thing should not happen
For that what interruption you see the question is
what steps the government has taken to contain the press and also in
future to guard interruption 
Yeah thank you
Thank you sir 
Unfortunately the media overplayed the plague situation
in the country 
Even when the world health authorities came here to certify
that the quick actions and very effective actions have been taken by the
government to control and contained this disease the media didn't
support unfortunately 
 It's not that we have not done the job
We have done the job one word world over we are being
praised for effective control of this plague in very quick way
Mr Swaminathan 
Recently I had occasion to meet the two words the
world renowned 
They had a conference in the India at about during the
time of plague 
And in that conference they have concluded it was not plague at
all 
The disease was not plague at all
It was a disease just stimulating plague and originally because
these people have found out and report to the press it was plague they
have been consistently saying it is the plague
He had also also given me a paper 
For want of time I couldn't go through it completely 
Well the minister is aware that there is another idea that the
disease is not a plague but a disease which has stimulated plague and
because originally it was said by some authorities it was plague they have
been consistently saying that is plague 
Sir uh it is confirmed by the N I C the national 
uh our communicative diseases sir uh one word they said it is plague
And it is clarified by the or supported by our scientist 
medical scientist also have supported
I K Gujral 
The honourable minister is right
Just a second just a second I am two words just
after this
In addition to what my colleague said sir
Yeah 
The honourable member wants to know about the terms of
reference of this committee I think a few words interruption
Yes yes yes 
 A few words financial matters will he look
Because not because primarily that is the agency to do
something that is why I want that there is nothing like that in the sense
of the interruption you can help sir uh I can repeat two
words the house 
That the terms of reference records is to elucidate factors
responsible for the current outbreak of plague plague and infact perhaps
it includes what it say interruption 
I say will they will the committee
Whether whether whether it is for want of financial fund that
also the committee can look into it
Alright then your you make it so clear and you write
to the committee that you can go into it 
I will be happy
Shree Guj I K Gujral
Sir uh the honourable minister has tried to 
underplay the situation 
 It's not a question of propaganda
 It's not a question whether it is so many cases more
or less
Issue basically is and I hope my honourable friend knows that
not once not twice not three times in last forty or fifty years 
there are any number of reports available and you do not need one more
expert to make it to tell you that that is no municipal committee in the
country except the N D M C which is financially
viable okay 
Now the point is sir if our you are
going by the plan and if the planning is to be made obviously
government I assume I hope is a is a corporate body works together 
 And therefore may I ask him , has he thought and approached , , the the
planning commission or something , that the structure the municipality has to
be increased No.(1)
No.(2) Sir, has the honourable one word thought in terms
of improving the sanitation methodology and technology because it doesn't
need a WHO report to tell us that our seat is updating
It doesn't need any health organization that we see filth around
They will first collect garbage on the road side and then we
remove it
And therefore all along disease is one word This incident
of plague whatever dimension I am not discussing has brought up and despare
at home
May I ask him if he is believed to undertake apart from the
committee one word to avoid the situation
Has the cabinet I wrote to Cabinet myself the prime one word
 wrote back to me that the one word and the ministry of urban
Development
Have the ministry of Urban Development and ministry of health set
together to evolve the comprehensive scheme to see that our health and
sanitation improves? Swaminathan Sir the honourable member is right one
word what he said about the maintenance of sanitic conditions in the
limits of municipality
It doesd need atleast throught and a coordinative approach to
solve this problem not only the health ministry
This is by the ministry of Urban Development, local ministry, the
state ministry and the local authorities concerned
As far as the one word necessarily we have to find a way
and in that direction we have to consult the the planning commission and for
that one word suggestion one word
