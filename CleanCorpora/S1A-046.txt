""
""
""
""
""
Why you don't like the 
""
""
Climate is okay the people are not uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh 
""
""
""
And uh 
Bhosle family or the Shahu family and
""
""
They are royal people 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Courteous behaviour
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 the non-marathi I think
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
That is why  behaviour has slightly undergone
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But here the  either
Brahmins or  Marathas
""
""
Local Kolhapuris
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No  we have had bad uh
""
""
""
""
""
Experience
""
""
""
""
""
time I don't know why
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No even an ordinary  or a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Every where in the cities bargaining will go on 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh  extra
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 drunkards and all
""
""
""
""
""
That means many  are there in
""
""
""
You see in Amrawati you will find people lying you know 
 lot and
""
""
""
""
""
""
I had totally different ideas about Amravati 
""
""
""
""
""
I mean from the lower strata
""
""
 we call that sort of rickshaw
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Cycle rickshaw and all 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That population is the largest in working
""
""
Even the auto people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Even these auto rickshaw  people are
""
""
And they  very terrifying
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 they are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
less 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah still less 
""
""
""
is more  so that compared to your region
""
""
""
""
""
""
very less
""
""
""
 closely associated
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 it
""
""
So they are your 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Vidarbha region 
""
And here  we don't find the students smoking this smoking
""
""
""
 they know the
""
""
""
""
a sign of manhood for them actually smoking 
""
""
 picking up
""
""
""
""
thing
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ha
""
""
But some people you know they read the statutory warning
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
even alcohol
""
""
""
""
""
""
Maybe to keep the company these students force  na
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It happens sometimes
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in their company they will laugh at you
""
""
It happens you know  someone is uh rather behaving
decently  very
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
