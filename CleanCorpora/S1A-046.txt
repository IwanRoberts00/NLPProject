Hi Chitra 
Fine thank you 
When did you come from Amrawati
On sixth of November 
How are you liking Kolhapur 
Now I am adjusting to it 
Why you didn't like it initially
No 
No 
Why you don't like the uhm climate here 
Climate is okay the people are not uh 
People are very nice 
Yeah 
Climate is not nice because we are accustomed to the coastal
climate 
So we don't like this dry climate 
I don't feel familiar at all 
I like straight and perspiration then only I feel at home
otherwise no laughter 
But uh I like uh the climate here 
 It's nice and cool 
And uh though the people are slightly uh from the 
Bhosle family or the Shahu family and
They are royal people all are royal people 
 One or two words 
They talk and uh behave that way uhn 
Yeah
Courteous behaviour
Having the arrogance of the aristocrat
Aren't they soft spoken like the Nagpur people 
no full of courtesy
 No 
In Nagpur uh Nagpur uh population is very much affected by
 the non-marathi I think
Yeah 
That is why uhm their behaviour has slightly undergone
some change
Uh changed means that nazakat of Hindi
language that's in your
That way of speaking 
And uh specially the business community is affected by Punjabis and
Sindhis
 Accha 
So they are naturally more polite 
But here the business community is dominated by either
Brahmins or perhaps Marathas
Local Kolhapuris
Local Kolhapuri 
So they are very arrogront in their uh one word 
Only tone sort of arrogance but inwardly they are
 very uhm
No we have had bad uh
Is it so
Experience
 Haan very bad experience 
They are very I mean uh to make friends they take a lot of
time I don't know why
Yeah are they so choosy
 Haan laughter 
No even an ordinary uh rickshawallah or a
shopkeeper
 Accha 
Will uh won't talk to you in a very polite manner
like he is not bothered whether his product is sold or not 
He is more bothered that if he like you want to
bargain he says just keep it down and get lost laughter 
 Tells you 
And bargaining on our side is very normal sort of a
thing yeah yeah these days
 Yeah yeah 
Every where in the cities bargaining will go on 
So also our hostel uh staff who are working including
the warden the bai 
She breaks over very
Sweeper everybody are horribly arrogant 
They just want to do what is their alloted job 
 According to the rule
Alloted work that's all 
Might be for years together they have been doing the same job
fed up with this steoro type of that job earning from 
But uh in our area people are ready to earn a extra
buck 
 Accha 
Here even if you are ready to pay them they will not uh
Maybe they have a lot of self-respecting personality
Yeah and ego is 
 Egoism is there at a very high rate 
 And there is too much awareness yeah 
Too much awareness about their working hours
 Haan 
Their right time is over okay no work 
In uh Nagpur
And one fine thing we found in Kolhapur is that people are
I think so not too much addicted you see drinks or paan
 or something of that sort
Yeah these two things are common in my town
 Because that is very less 
In our side you see Vidarbha region
 Paan do you say about paan 
Ah yeah Vidarbha side we see less paan
 shops here anywhere addicted and all drunkards and all
 Yeah the spots of uh 
That means many paan shops are there in
 one word 
You see in Amrawati you will find people lying you know 
 drunk heavily drunked drunk lot and
lots of people know specially those rickshaw puller I mean lower
strata public
 Is it so
I had totally different ideas about Amravati 
Yeah 
I mean from the lower strata
 Ekka we call that sort of rickshaw
 Haan no cycle rickshaw 
 Cycle rickshaw 
Cycle rickshaw and all 
So all of them are heavily drunk 
 Cycle rickshaws are there 
That population is the largest in working
Even the auto people
 One word cycle rickshaw
Even the auto pe 
Don't you think it's inhuman rather
No no it's the cheapest form of transports still
And the buses are very few
Even these auto rickshaw wallah people are
all drunk mostly 
And they it's very terrifying
Here that way it's quite safe
Till you get down you don't have any guarantee 
 Ah here it's very secure they are
arrogant they are all you see 
No safe driving you know
No good mannered also or rather we can say character wise
also having a very clean spotless character maybe that may be the
influence of Tarabai
And most of the rickshaw persons they are graduate
 Haan 
Just now I came know he was B Com person
 Haan 
So now-a-days they don't get job and instead of 
hunting the job they prefer that
 Maybe 
That may be the reason one of the reasons
These two things are really good in them alcoholism is
less paan eating is less and honesty is there 
 still there 
 Compartively in our area paan 
eating is uh 
Still less 
Yeah still less 
Ha ha here I think that uh paan eating
is more no no so that compared to your region
 No no 
No there are few paan and all they don't
very less
Very less I feel see otherwise Kolhapur and paan
 closely associated
There even our college students you know they take that
 tambaku 
Is it so oh
 That's it
So they are your gurus laughter 
And here
And smoking is also very great among the students there in
Vidarbha region 
And here we don't find the students smoking this smoking
and all 
 Now Americans and Westerners they know the
evils of smoking as here they pick it up as a style you know
Ha only statuatory warning is there but it's 
a sign of manhood for them actually smoking 
 But I think that that also gone for picking up
on style nothing else
Reduced now because it is this TV influence in every
thing
Yeah yeah yeah
But here it is becoming lesser
 That's what I feel
And we know actually this no
Ha
But some people you know they read the statutory warning
laugh and they start smoking
Uhm start smoking and that's true
Once you get into a habit nothing can stop you not
even alcohol
As your blood turns alcoholic and then you will get addict to
cigarette smoking 
Maybe to keep the company these students force na
 the friends
Yeah
And in order to
You can't oppose when you are in minority and they are in
majority you can't oppose otherwise they'll laugh at me
That is why uhn
It happens sometimes
That fear of public opinion compulsory to take
Otherwise you feel rather afraid to stay down and shout of
 one word in their company they will laugh at you
It happens you know someone is uh rather behaving
decently then other people they laugh at them and he feels very
guilty about them yeah 
 It's the style of one word if
you see a gentleman like that way to smoke 
And I'm really impressed with this University and
its uh maintenance 
 Maintenace 
Yeah
And especially 
 Especially these you know library is
very good 
 These department people I like so much you know
No our director is a very nice person I have never come
across
Yeah yeah yeah
Such a nice person occupying such a high post
 very friendly and we are not afraid also to 
 Soft spoken gentle and 
He is a scholarly person but he
 Ha ha have a an informal
talk with him
 He's not a barrier between
Ha no
We are one word 
Very great person and grand person
And uh 
Then he will he will be remaining in our memory for ever
Yeah yeah it is true
In Nagpur University 
 One or two words in his place but
still 
He has nothing he is a very unassuming type
of
 Unassuming yeah really I wanted to use the same
word and uh 
Very few persons are like that 
But in our University we can almost feel the 
levels of corruption which you can't feel here
 Feel that 
Very high level
Everywhere it is
No here here you see there is less corrupt
You can't bribe them you see
It is there or it's not there we are not going to
judge but
Actually we don't see these
No no we saw them bribing those ladies you know to sweep
and all 
They were not ready to sweep
There is no it doesn't come in our duty 
So it's not easy to bribe them 
They have that self-decency or self-honesty as Shubha said
 they have maintained it 
Or may be that royal blood still frozen their vein
In our University no one bothers to do anything
Yeah
You just give them anything 
Now it more dominates on the class one 
Ours is also worst it is 
They won't accept and they won't move
No but if there if you give any extra money anything
can be done
Anything can be done
But here it is the other way round
Even take marklist one word laughter at
twelfth standarad level board Amarawati Board is
Hazard of thinking
Yeah 
So we should thank 
Dr Shastri and Professor Karande and now we should
conclude for what he has 
When when is you paper reading 
When is your paper reading
I don't know it was actually on twenty-sixth but
uh Jahagirdar said put anywhere now
 You got chances no 
Any where
Yeah
So you have to be prepared anyday
Yeah yeah I'am already prepared with my
casette on 
I am going to show it through the cassette 
 Well how did you 
How did you shoot the cassette like with who was the
cameraman 
Yeah Ganesh one word he is a professional and
 he's my cameraman and he is a student of Shrikant Madhushri from
J J School of Arts
And he has got his own studio in Ratnagiri 
And he is our friend so straightway we can say 
Ganesh company and we can just drop it
But how did you get this idea that uh you should make a
video and
Actually in the class you know I make free use of 
cassettes for my kids 
So we show them one 
But this was for the first time otherwise that shooting
job my husband used to do for me or Ganesh but uh sometimes I
felt I should learn atleast samething of it
I cannot handle the camera so video camera so confidently 
but I am comparatively good at outdoors 
Indoors and closeups I had to take help of my husband and Ganesh
But then editing commentary writing dubbing then
introducing the third scene of Santoor everything I have done only
Ganesh was there he used to give me occasional instructions like that 
And camera handling actually outdoor landscaping that
landscape shot I have taken and actually the close ups and some parts
of your architectural shots of that building Ganesh took my husband
took and close ups of the faces my husband and Ganesh took
But uh uhm like how did you uhm how do you use your
video for uh teaching every day teaching
Everyday teaching means not in the class 
Not in the class
In the class uh there is questions and answers session
After the lecture
Group discussion class uh
Your which classes do you teach 
Uh right from F Y B A to M A two
What is F Y B A 
 F Y is the first year
 First year 
Uhn
B A to M A part one and M A part two 
So after my working hours you know I am having about free periods
Even my kids they have got free periods they come to me sometimes
 I'll take them to we have got such sound proof AC
room 
 It's actually computer room we have got ten computers 
but is just like a hall remaining part is unoccupied you know and there
are chairs semicircular monitor is there
So straight away we can take facility of that room and our
principal cabin it has got one set T V set monitor uh video is there
 and even that is sound proof and AC 
So only five or six students are there
Sometime they come in group for explanation and asking
their doubts and difficulties
So I can take them to the principal's cabin that
way he's very generous
