<I>
""
""
Hi Chitra 
""
""
Fine thank you 
""
""
When did you come from Amrawati
""
""
On sixth of November 
""
""
How are you liking Kolhapur 
""
""
Now I am adjusting to it 
""
""
Why you didn't like it initially
""
""
No 
""
""
No 
""
Why you don't like the 
""
""
Climate is okay the people are not uh 
""
""
People are very nice 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Climate is not nice because we are accustomed to the coastal
climate 
""
So 
""
I don't feel 
""
I like  and perspiration then only I feel at home
otherwise no 
""
""
But uh 
""
""
""
And uh 
Bhosle family or the Shahu family and
""
""
They are royal people 
""
""
""
""
""
They talk and uh 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Courteous behaviour
""
""
Having the arrogance of the  aristocrat
""
""
Aren't they soft spoken 
no  full of courtesy
""
""
""
""
""
In Nagpur uh  Nagpur uh population is very much affected by
 the non-marathi I think
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
That is why  behaviour has slightly undergone
some change
""
""
Uh changed means that  of Hindi
language  in your
""
""
That way of speaking 
""
And uh specially the business community is affected by Punjabis and
Sindhis
""
""
""
""
""
So they are naturally more polite 
""
But here the  either
Brahmins or  Marathas
""
""
Local Kolhapuris
""
""
Local Kolhapuri 
""
So they 
""
""
Only tone  inwardly they are
 very uhm
""
""
No  we have had bad uh
""
""
Is it so
""
""
Experience
""
""
""
""
They are very I mean uh  to make friends they take a lot of
time I don't know why
""
""
Yeah  are they so choosy
""
""
""
""
""
No even an ordinary  or a
shopkeeper
""
""
""
""
""
Will uh  in a very polite manner
like 
""
He is more bothered that  want to
bargain 
""
""
""
""
""
And bargaining on  normal sort of a
thing  these days
""
""
""
""
""
Every where in the cities bargaining will go on 
""
""
So also our hostel uh  including
the warden the 
""
""
She breaks over very
""
""
Sweeper everybody are horribly arrogant 
""
They just want to 
""
""
 the rule
""
""
Alloted work 
""
""
Might be for years together they have been doing the same job
fed up with this steoro type of that job earning from 
""
""
But uh  extra
buck 
""
""
""
""
""
Here even if you are ready to pay them  they will not uh
""
""
""
Maybe they have a lot of self-respecting personality
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Too much awareness about their working hours
""
""
""
""
""
Their right time is over okay 
""
In uh Nagpur
""
""
And one  fine thing we found in Kolhapur is that people are
I think so not too much addicted you see  paan
 or something of that sort
""
""
Yeah  are common in my town
""
""
""
""
""
In our side you see  Vidarbha region
""
""
""
""
""
Ah yeah Vidarbha side  paan
 drunkards and all
""
""
""
""
""
That means many  are there in
""
""
""
You see in Amrawati you will find people lying you know 
 lot and
lots of people know specially those  I mean lower
strata public
""
""
 Is it so
""
I had totally different ideas about Amravati 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
I mean from the lower strata
""
""
 we call that sort of rickshaw
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Cycle rickshaw and all 
""
""
So all of 
""
""
""
""
That population is the largest in working
""
""
Even the auto people
""
""
 cycle rickshaw
""
""
Even the auto 
""
""
Don't you think  inhuman rather
""
""
No no  the cheapest form of transports still
""
""
And the buses are very few
""
""
Even these auto rickshaw  people are
all drunk 
""
And they  very terrifying
""
Here that way  quite safe
""
""
Till you get down you don't 
""
""
 they are
arrogant they are all you see 
""
""
No safe driving you know
""
""
No good mannered also or rather we can say character wise
also  having a very clean spotless character maybe that may be the
influence of Tarabai
""
""
And most of the rickshaw persons they are graduate
""
""
""
""
""
Just now I came know he was B Com person
""
""
""
""
""
So now-a-days they don't get job 
hunting  they prefer that
""
""
""
""
""
That may be the reason one of the reasons
""
""
These two things are really good in them  alcoholism is
less 
""
""
""
""
eating is uh 
""
""
Still less 
""
""
Yeah still less 
""
""
Ha ha  eating
is more  so that compared to your region
""
""
""
""
""
No there are few  and all they don't
very less
""
""
Very less I feel see  paan
 closely associated
""
""
There even our college students you know they take that
""
""
""
Is it so  oh
""
""
 it
""
""
So they are your 
""
""
And here
""
""
And smoking is also very great among the students there in
Vidarbha region 
""
And here  we don't find the students smoking this smoking
and all 
""
""
 they know the
evils of smoking as here they pick it up as a style you know
""
""
Ha only statuatory warning is there 
a sign of manhood for them actually smoking 
""
""
 picking up
on style nothing else
""
""
Reduced now  because it is this TV influence in every
thing
""
""
Yeah yeah yeah
""
""
But here it is becoming lesser
""
""
 what I feel
""
""
And we know actually this no
""
""
Ha
""
""
But some people you know they read the statutory warning
laugh and they start smoking
""
""
Uhm start smoking and  true
""
""
Once you get into a habit  not
even alcohol
""
""
As your blood turns alcoholic and then you will get addict to
cigarette smoking 
""
""
Maybe to keep the company these students force  na
 the friends
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And in order to
""
""
You can't oppose  when you are in minority and they are in
majority you can't oppose otherwise  laugh at me
""
""
That is why uhn
""
""
It happens sometimes
""
""
That fear  take
""
""
Otherwise you feel rather afraid to stay down and shout of
 in their company they will laugh at you
""
""
It happens you know  someone is uh rather behaving
decently  very
guilty about them yeah 
""
""
 if
you see a gentleman like that way 
""
""
And  really impressed with this University and
its uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And 
""
""
 is
very good 
""
""
 people I like so much you know
""
""
No our director is a very nice person I have never come
across
""
""
Yeah yeah yeah
""
""
Such a nice person  post
""
""
""
""
""
""
He is a scholarly person but he
""
""
 informal
talk with him
""
""
 not a barrier between
""
""
Ha no
""
""
We are 
""
""
Very great person and grand person
""
""
And uh 
""
""
Then he will he will be remaining in our memory for ever
""
""
Yeah yeah it is true
""
""
In 
""
""
 but
still 
""
""
He has nothing he is a very  type
of
""
""
 yeah really I wanted to use the same
word and uh 
""
""
Very few persons are like that 
""
But in our University we can almost 
levels of corruption  which you can't feel here
""
""
""
""
""
Very high level
""
""
Everywhere it is
""
""
No here here you see there is less corrupt
""
""
You can't bribe them you see
""
""
It is there or  not there we are not going to
judge but
""
""
Actually we don't see these
""
""
No no we saw them bribing those ladies you know  to sweep
and all 
""
They were not ready to sweep
""
There is no it doesn't come in our duty 
""
So 
""
They have that  self-honesty as Shubha said
""
""
Or may be that royal blood still  frozen their vein
""
""
In our University  no one bothers to do anything
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You just give them anything 
""
Now 
""
""
Ours is also 
""
They won't accept  and they won't move
""
""
No but if  anything
can be done
""
""
Anything can be done
""
""
But here  it is the other way round
""
""
Even take marklist  at
twelfth standarad level board Amarawati Board is
""
""
Hazard of thinking
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So we should thank 
""
""
Dr Shastri  and Professor Karande and now we should
conclude 
""
""
""
When when is you paper reading 
""
When is your paper reading
""
""
I don't know it was actually on twenty-sixth  but
uh Jahagirdar said  put anywhere now
""
""
""
""
""
Any where
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So you have to be prepared anyday
""
""
Yeah yeah  with my
casette on 
""
I am going to 
""
""
""
""
""
How did you shoot the cassette like with who was the
cameraman 
""
""
Yeah  he is a professional and
 from
J J School of Arts
""
And he has got his own studio in Ratnagiri 
""
And he is our friend 
Ganesh company and we can just drop it
""
""
But how did you get this idea that uh  you should make a
video and
""
""
Actually in the class you know I make free use of 
cassettes 
""
So we show them one 
""
But this was for the first time  shooting
job my husband used to do for me  sometimes I
felt I should learn atleast samething of it
""
I cannot handle the camera 
but I am comparatively good at outdoors 
""
Indoors and closeups I had to take help of my husband and Ganesh
""
""
But then  then
introducing the third scene of Santoor  only
Ganesh was there 
""
And camera handling actually outdoor  that
landscape shot  and some parts
of your  Ganesh took my husband
took  and close ups of the faces my husband and Ganesh took
""
""
But uh uhm  uhm how do you use your
video for  uh teaching every day teaching
""
""
Everyday teaching means not in the class 
""
""
Not in the class
""
""
In the class  uh there is questions and answers session
""
""
After the lecture
""
""
Group discussion class uh
""
""
Your which classes do you teach 
""
""
Uh right from F Y B A to M A two
""
""
What is F Y B A 
""
""
 the first year
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn
""
""
B A to M A 
""
So after my working hours you know I am having about free periods
""
""
Even my kids they have got free periods they come to me sometimes
""
 sound proof AC
room 
""
""
but is just like a hall remaining part is  unoccupied you know and there
are chairs semicircular monitor is there
""
So straight away we can take  and our
principal  uh video is there
""
""
So only five or six students are there
""
Sometime  explanation and asking
their doubts and difficulties
""
So I can  that
way
