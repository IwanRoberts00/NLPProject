I am Dr B D Khane 
""
""
I am Dr M P Patil 
""
""
How are you Patil  ?
""
""
Fine 
""
What about you  ?
""
""
I am also fine 
""
""
What about your kids  ?
""
""
They are alright 
""
""
When did you come to the department today  ?
""
""
Uh today I came  fifteen
""
""
""
What about your refresher course you wanted to go  ?
""
""
No no 
""
""
Do you thing that refresher course serve the right purpose 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
But what about the most of the refresher courses  ?
""
""
Most of  on
U G C pattern 
""
Therefore 
""
""
Purpose is defeated
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Isn't it true with also post graduation teaching  ?
""
""
Uhn  ?
""
""
Isn't it true with post graduation teaching  ?
""
""
See if some 
refresher course or 
benefitted to even  teachers
""
""
Uhm  saying that refresher course
""
""
""
No no
""
""
And then in same way the
""
""
My experience is not that 
""
""
I see 
""
""
Because you know when 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
They 
a few words  one
word 
""
""
No even I had a very good experience at in Bombay 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But if you take into consideration the overall picture in
India
""
""
 specially in northern
India  courses are not conducted
""
""
""
Whole purpose is  defeated
""
""
Whole  uh some refresher some university
is  and
they give these certificates  Indore University
and many others 
""
""
It is waste of time 
""
""
Yes the labour of time  money
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the basic purpose is not served
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Even their teaching at post graduate level it is so
frustrating particularly use of English 
""
""
""
""
""
Because generally many of the students they offer  uh
Marathi medium 
""
""
So the point is whether we should switch over to English 
 uh uh incorporate
teaching into 
""
""
""
""
""
 would be better to teach in Marathi
""
""
""
But then
""
""
Because the majority will  in
ninety-nine uh people percentage 
""
Only one or two students uh  if he will be outsider or
non-Maharashtrian he only offers English
""
Now what is the purpose 
English
""
""
But in that case the university education 
lose its uh national uh 
Marathwada Nagpur
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uh offer this Marathi in which  in instead of English they
 teach in Marathi
""
""
They have to teach in 
""
""
But thereby they will lose the national character 
""
""
How  ?
""
""
That boys from Karnataka they can't come to  Maharashtra or
the Maharashtrian can't go to
""
""
But even in uh  they teach in this
their mother 
""
""
But the problem with India is of uh  more of linguistic
problems 
""
We should have to have some common language 
""
And that apart we don't have the  teaching material in regional
languages 
""
""
Yes but that is not the problem even in Japan  Russia they
""
""
""
But Japan doesn't have the  as
much as we have 
""
""
You know we have no common language no except Hindi or this
""
""
Even this Hindi was 
""
""
Uh considering all this problems  what I feel that we
should have English for higher education  isn't it ?
""
""
But some nationalist leaders they oppose now this  uh in
""
""
""
That is the problem with our whole education  yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
We just carry on the show 
""
""
Show yes 
""
""
But the purpose is 
defeated
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So what else we can do  ?
""
Just to 
""
We don't have the 
""
""
Yes 
""
But we have no other alternatives 
""
""
I think that is case in every  of our life
""
""
""
Not in the department but all over India also  this problem
all we are facing 
""
""
The question of the work culture 
""
""
Yes yes 
""
""
But it is good thing that  modern
transit here  uhm
""
""
Study the art he scored more and this 
and intellectual 
""
Now  coming
November 
""
""
Yeah but you also must have helped him as a parent 
""
""
Yeah that support we give  then
tuitions and all other things 
""
But the hard work is also credit goes to my student only 
because he 
""
""
But beside the financial support one needs the moral support
too  that you must have done
""
""
We extended it 
""
We both parents 
""
Then we create this  uh convinient uh atmosphere at home also
""
""
Not disturbing him in 
""
Right from the beginning he was punctual in his study 
""
He got up early in the morning at five  then he
""
""
""
What was that 
""
""
Total 
""
""
Uhm  two
words  in government medical college
Miraj 
""
""
Because again there is this  uh
""
""
""
Out of hundred  uh only twenty-four seats are
open 
""
Remaining seventy-six  this category
or other category 
""
Only twenty-four seats are open to 
""
And his uh number was ninety 
""
And how is your daughter  ?
""
""
Daughter is fine 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I have not considered her anything to  if she likes
Arts  she
will go in for medicine 
""
But actually what  go on
working hard 
""
""
My second son is also clever 
""
He stood in 
""
He is studying in tenth standard 
""
He is included in scholar batch 
""
In scholar batch also he topped  in this uh first
test 
""
""
That is also true of her  she stood first in her school
""
""
But at the same time she  but also
participate in other curricular activity  in
sports 
""
""
She is active 
""
""
She is more active 
""
""
Expected in 
""
""
Yes  so I always tell her that percentage is not that
important  but the knowledge is very important
""
""
My younger son is also  allrounder
""
""
He took part in the sports 
""
He is good uh  he is playing
cricket 
""
 teachers day he become a various
teacher 
""
""
I think only that much we can do for our students 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Because  reservation or no reservation is not in our hand
""
""
So only we can  and
provide this sort of uh guidence to them 
some day 
""
And reward 
""
Not necessarily that everything they should
""
""
Hard work is essential 
""
""
Hard work is 
""
""
To get any success 
""
""
And positive attitude is also very important 
""
One shouldn't get frustrated or disgusted because of this
reservation policy 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
They always say that there is always a room on the top 
place on the top 
""
""
Because now a days there is a lot of competition in every
field 
""
""
Competition is there but this competition is not healthy 
often it is manipulated competition 
""
""
""
reserved candidate  uh
this 
""
But open candidate  who secured more than
ninety-one
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Correct 
""
""
Private college
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Private colleges 
""
""
No no in the government college this reservation  due to
reservation 
""
But open candidate even ninety-nine three 
""
""
""
""
""
Now as we say that the purpose of refresher course is
defeated the same the purpose of 
""
""
""
""
""
They go to Delhi 
""
""
 one
word 
""
""
And it is aimed at electoral 
""
""
All our education policies should be over hauled 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Now a days 
""
""
This is in our country  this is because the government
take the popular decision
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Government doesn't stick to  some basic level of standard
or basic criterias 
""
There is so much uh 
""
""
Yes there actually 
""
""
So we study only for the sake of examination 
examination 
""
""
""
""
""
Knowledge 
""
""
And the examinations  are
""
""
Because the students study only this 
""
They don't attend lecture 
""
They were not 
""
They don't read any English book 
""
They don't take notes in the class 
""
They only depend on this uh  or the
shortcomings 
""
""
These are the bitter truths of a democracy
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Since all the elements of  uh democracy are manifested in
Indian experience
""
""
Yes 
""
But even though the  India
is a great democracy 
""
""
That is it has played ourselves  but in reality the
experience is totally different 
""
""
Uhn that is 
""
In every country 
is going on 
""
In every country particularly in Russia 
""
""
Now other day I
""
""
The political and other economic condition is worse than
India in Russia 
""
""
No corruption is uh  everywhere
""
""
Corruption 
""
""
But the degree  degree varies
""
""
In Western Asia the religion  is
very important for them 
""
The Islamic 
""
Islamic nations  they don't want any change
""
""
""
In comparison between Muslim country India is 
other day I happen to see the list of uh ten countries 
where there is least corruption 
""
The list is published in 
""
""
And what is the number of uh our 
""
""
There is not a single city from India 
""
I think only one Asia I think Japan  and
Singapore  feature in that
""
""
""
""
""
No corruption there 
""
""
Corrupt it is easy to do themselves  in
those cities 
""
There may be corruption  uh problematic
""
""
So the businessman they all of prefer that city
""
""
""
""
""
What is uh solution for  ?
""
""
In our case the democracy has attempted to the problems of
corruption 
mostly they come from the  for the
academic positions  for
academic position
""
""
Academic position 
""
""
""
teachers are bound to be elected
