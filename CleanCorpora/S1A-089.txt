When did you come to the department today  ?
""
""
Uh today I came  fifteen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Purpose is defeated
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Isn't it true with also post graduation teaching  ?
""
""
Uhn  ?
""
""
""
""
""
See if some 
""
benefitted to even  teachers
""
""
Uhm  saying that refresher course
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because you know when 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if you take into consideration the overall picture in
India
""
""
 specially in northern
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the basic purpose is not served
""
""
""
""
""
Even their teaching at post graduate level it is so
frustrating particularly use of English 
""
""
""
""
""
Because generally many of the students they offer  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ninety-nine uh people percentage 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But in that case the university education 
""
Marathwada Nagpur
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the Maharashtrian can't go to
""
""
""
""
""
""
But the problem with India is of uh  more of linguistic
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes but that is not the problem even in Japan  Russia they
""
""
""
""
much as we have 
""
""
You know we have no common language no except Hindi or this
""
""
Even this Hindi was 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is the problem with our whole education  yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But the purpose is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But we have no other alternatives 
""
""
I think that is case in every  of our life
""
""
""
Not in the department but all over India also  this problem
all we are facing 
""
""
""
""

Because the students study only this

They only depend on this uh  or the
