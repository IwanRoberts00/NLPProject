<I>
I am Dr B D Khane 
I am Dr M P Patil department of History 
How are you Patil ?
Fine 
What about you ?
I am also fine 
What about your kids ?
They are alright 
When did you come to the department today ?
Uh today I came to department at eleven fifteen
What about your refresher course you wanted to go ?
No no 
Do you thing that refresher course serve the right purpose 
Yes some refresher course serve the purpose 
But what about the most of the refresher courses ?
Most of refresher courses are uhm not conducted on
U G C pattern 
Therefore the purpose which 
Purpose is defeated
Uhm 
Isn't it true with also post graduation teaching ?
Uhn ?
Isn't it true with post graduation teaching ?
See if some senior persons uh attended this uh 
refresher course or gave lectures they are going to be 
benefitted to even P G teachers
Uhm personally I'm saying that refresher course
 these are very frustrating 
No no
And then in same way the
My experience is not that 
I see 
Because you know when uh I've been in Dharwad 
 uhm there are some very good uh resource persons 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
They say like on many knotty problems like uh 
a few words and Ashoka inscription so there are some one
word where refresher are useful to even P G teachers 
No even I had a very good experience at in Bombay 
Uhm 
But if you take into consideration the overall picture in
India
 Haan overall be specially in northern
India uh th this refresher co courses are not conducted
 very well 
Whole purpose is defeated
Whole they had even uh some refresher some university
is even this uh the people would've remained absent and
they give these certificates for example this uh Indore University
and many others 
It is waste of time 
Yes the labour of time has one word money
 Is not money 
And the basic purpose is not served
Yes I agree with you on that point 
Even their teaching at post graduate level it is so
frustrating particularly use of English medium 
 English 
Because generally many of the students they offer uh
Marathi medium 
So the point is whether we should switch over to English 
 uhm or whether the university should uh uh incorporate
teaching into Marathi language 
 Uhm 
 Uh no it would be better to teach in Marathi
But then
Because the majority will two words in
ninety-nine uh people percentage they offer Marathi medium 
Only one or two students uh if he will be outsider or
non-Maharashtrian he only offers English
Now what is the purpose purpose of teaching in English 
English
But in that case the university education will uh 
lose its uh national uh no only Maharashtra one word 
Marathwada Nagpur
Yes 
Uh offer this Marathi in which in instead of English they
 teach in Marathi
They have to teach in one word 
But thereby they will lose the national character 
How ?
That boys from Karnataka they can't come to Maharashtra or
the Maharashtrian can't go to
But even in uh foreign countries uh they teach in this
their mother tongue no 
But the problem with India is of uh more of linguistic
problems 
We should have to have some common language 
And that apart we don't have the teaching material in regional
languages 
Yes but that is not the problem even in Japan Russia they
 teach in their own language 
But Japan doesn't have the linguistic adversity as
much as we have 
You know we have no common language no except Hindi or this
 E E English 
Even this Hindi was is opposed in uh south India 
Uh considering all this problems what I feel that we
should have English for higher education isn't it ?
But some nationalist leaders they oppose now this uh in
 teaching of English 
That is the problem with our whole education yes
 structure 
 Yes 
Yes 
We just carry on the show 
Show yes 
But the purpose is always defeated 
defeated
Uhm 
So what else we can do ?
Just to rise over this frustration 
We don't have the uh satisfaction work satisfaction 
Yes 
But we have no other alternatives 
I think that is case in every department of our life
Not in the department but all over India also this problem
all we are facing 
The question of the work culture is never promisive 
Yes yes 
But it is good thing that uh we have some modern
transit here laughter uhm
Study the art he scored more and this one word 
and intellectual 
Now he's uh uh facing his first uh examination coming
November 
Yeah but you also must have helped him as a parent 
Yeah that support we give I brought books uh then
tuitions and all other things 
But the hard work is also credit goes to my student only 
because he studied hard 
But beside the financial support one needs the moral support
too that you must have done
We extended it 
We both parents my wife and I 
Then we create this uh convinient uh atmosphere at home also
Not disturbing him in on any issue 
Right from the beginning he was punctual in his study 
He got up early in the morning at five O'clock then he
 one word in throughout the year 
What was that 
Total two words 
Uhm he scored sir ninety-seven marks for two
words into now he is in Miraj in government medical college
Miraj 
Because again there is this preference for uh
 one word 
Out of hundred uh seats uh only twenty-four seats are
open 
Remaining seventy-six they are alloted to this category
or other category 
Only twenty-four seats are open to these students 
And his uh number was ninety 
And how is your daughter ?
Daughter is fine 
Uhm
I have not considered her anything to do if she likes
Arts she can go in for Arts if she is interested in medicine she
will go in for medicine 
But actually what I'm telling her that you just go on
working hard don't think of uh reservation or that sort of thing 
My second son is also clever 
He stood in uh in the first two words 
He is studying in tenth standard 
He is included in scholar batch 
In scholar batch also he topped first uh in this uh first
test semester 
That is also true of her she stood first in her school
But at the same time she did not only study but also
participate in other curricular activity curricular activity in
sports 
She is active one word 
She is more active 
Expected in one word 
Yes so I always tell her that percentage is not that
important but the knowledge is very important
My younger son is also allround allrounder
 
He took part in the sports games 
He is good uh swimmer he is good runner he is playing
cricket football 
 In On teachers day he become a various
teacher 
I think only that much we can do for our students 
Yes 
Because reservation or no reservation is not in our hand
So only we can give some kind of confidence in them and
provide this sort of uh guidence to them if you work hard 
some day you will are bound to be rewarded 
And reward come in their own way 
Not necessarily that everything they should
Hard work is essential 
Hard work is 
To get any success 
And positive attitude is also very important 
One shouldn't get frustrated or disgusted because of this
reservation policy 
Yeah 
They always say that there is always a room on the top 
place on the top 
Because now a days there is a lot of competition in every
field 
Competition is there but this competition is not healthy 
often it is manipulated competition 
 Sir sir one word this uh 
reserved candidate uh of fifty-five percent of student he get uh
this seat to M B B S 
But open candidate who who secured more than
ninety-one
 Competition is 
 One word 
Correct 
Private college
Uhm 
Private colleges 
No no in the government college this reservation due to
reservation uhm 
But open candidate even ninety-nine three he will not get 
 Uhm 
Now as we say that the purpose of refresher course is
defeated the same the purpose of reservation 
 This is also defeated 
They go to Delhi 
 It's a one word college not a one
word 
And it is aimed at electoral benefit 
All our education policies should be over hauled 
Yes 
Now a days 
This is in our country this is because the government
take the popular decision
Yes 
Government doesn't stick to some basic level of standard
or basic criterias 
There is so much uh corruption in education too 
Yes there actually that in a every uh 
So we study only for the sake of examination 
examination not for the knowledge 
 Examination 
Knowledge 
And the examinations are
Because the students study only this uh superguide 
They don't attend lecture 
They were not uh punctual in their attendence in the class 
They don't read any English book 
They don't take notes in the class 
They only depend on this uh uh super guides or the
shortcomings 
These are the bitter truths of a democracy
Yes 
Since all the elements of uh democracy are manifested in
Indian experience
Yes 
But even though the uh all these are two things India
is a great democracy you see in the world 
That is it has played ourselves but in reality the
experience is totally different 
Uhn that is 
In every country this problem of this uh corruption 
is going on 
In every country particularly in Russia 
Now other day I
The political and other economic condition is worse than
India in Russia 
No corruption is uh everywhere
Corruption one word 
But the degree degree varies
In Western Asia the religion uh West Asia religion is
very important for them 
The Islamic pe people they don't want any change 
Islamic nations they are static they don't want any change
 any progressive progress 
In comparison between Muslim country India is better 
other day I happen to see the list of uh ten countries in the world 
where there is least corruption 
The list is published in Times of India 
And what is the number of uh our 
There is not a single city from India 
I think only one Asia I think Japan yeah and
Singapore feature in that
 Yeah 
No corruption there 
Corrupt it is easy to do themselves uhm in
those cities 
There may be corruption but it is not that uh problematic
So the businessman they all of prefer that city
 Uhm 
What is uh solution for to overcome this corruption ?
In our case the democracy has attempted to the problems of
corruption for example our problem in educational field 
mostly they come from the one word uh elections for the
academic positions whereas in America there are no elections for
academic position
Academic position 
 Two words the criteria in college uh 
teachers are bound to be elected
