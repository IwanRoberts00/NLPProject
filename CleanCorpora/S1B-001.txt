""
So 
""
which are  growth and development of the
 body
""
Either plant body or 
""
So 
""
Proteins they are the 
""
So  proteins can be the
several kinds of amino acids 
""
Several types of amino acids are  present in the protein
molecules 
""
So in plants  inorganic
process 
""
""
The plants and also some micro organisms they have the ability to
fix the inorganic nitrogen and to convert it into the amino acid form 
""
But in the case of these animals  they have to depend on the
plants  for the amino acid source
""
The source of amino acids
""
They have either 
indirectly 
""
What does it mean direct  uh and the directly
dependent means 
""
""
""
""
""
In the case of herbivorous plants uh sorry herbivorous animals
 animals they are depending on the plants
for their foods 
""
So they are getting direct  ly the food materials from the
plants
""
understand 
""
But  in carnivores they are directly depending on the plants for
their 
""
That means  other
animals which are eating the  plants or otherwise you can say that
carnivorous animals they are eating herbivorous animals
""
That means indirectly  uh
source of the protein from the  plants
""
Understand 
""
So this amino acids are  the
components of the amino acids are also carbon  hydrogen
""
""
Carbon hydrogen oxygen and the  nitrogen
""
And in some cases  sulphur is also present
""
In some cases the present of 
BB-work 
""
So there may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acids 
bearing one or two amino groups 
""
These amino acids may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acid
bearing 
""
That means  know
""
""
So these four valency for the carbon atom  it is attached to one
amino groups  and to one carboxic group and to one
hydrogen and one 
""
And 
""
So every amino group is a so this amino acids may be  they are
of  BB-work
""
""
Basic  then acidic and the neutral amino acids
""
Then what does it mean basic amino acids 
""
So every amino  and amino acids
having a free amino group is known as a  basic amino acid
""
For example 
""
So this lysine and arginine they have it  having
 carbocil group and two amino group
""
One carbocil and a  and two amino group
""
That is why they are known as the  basic amino acids
""
And  such amino
group and
""
""
Two carboxic groups 
""
""
And two  one
amino and a two carboxic group
""
""
""
""
""
So they are known as acidic amino acid 
""
So  they are having one amino group and
one 
""
""
""
""
""
One carboxic and one  they are known as
neutral amino acids 
""
For acidic amino acid for example  glutonic acid and uh aspartic
acids
""
Glutonic and aspartic 
""
And for neutral amino acids examples 
phenylalanine etcetera 
""
Glycine 
""
So these are the three main type of amino acids
""
That is the  basic amino acids acidic amino acid and the
neutral amino acids
""
Understand 
""
Then  these amino acids
""
""
Two amino acids they can be linked together
""
Linked understand linked 
""
Together like by means of peptide bond peptide bond 
BB-Works 
""
So like that  to form a linear chain
of many amino acids 
""
Have you understood that chain
""
The two amino acids they can be linked together by means of peptide
bond
""
So like that  several bonds will be forming and like that a
linear chain of peptide bonds can be formed 
""
So these are known by the name  together these are known as the
 peptide
""
It is together form a peptide 
""
So what is a peptide  ?
""
And  will you say peptide what
is it  ?
""
A peptide is formed 
""
""
""
""
""
Different parts of the 
""
""
By by joining of 
""
""
By forming  several peptide bonds
""
Understand 
""
That is peptide bonds are formed in between two amino acids
""
Two amino acids can be  bonded together
""
Or joined together by forming peptide bonds 
""
So like that several amino acids will be united  or bonded
together  to form a linear chain of amino acids
""
They are known  that amino acid molecule is known as the peptide
""
A single peptide
""
A peptide is formed by the  bonding together of several peptide
bonds
""
Understand 
""
That means several amino acids  forming a
linear chain of  known as the peptide bonds
""
And these linear chains  molecule
contains a linear chain of these bonds they are known as the  not a single
 peptide
""
Okay a single peptide is formed  several amino acids
joined together or  bonded together
""
Understand 
""
That is known as a peptide 
""
So we will uh these proteins are micro molecules formed 
from a large number of peptide 
""
That means a protein molecule contains the large number of these
""
""
But  the structure or the function will be
different 
""
The properties of protein will be different from the properties of
a peptide or peptide bond
""
Understand 
""
That means the protein molecule contains several 
and also the peptide bonds but  protein
differs from the properties of the  peptide
""
Understand 
""
Uh we know that a protein molecule contains several peptides but
the properties are different 
""
 property of the protein is different from the property of the
 peptide
""
Understand
""
But protein molecule contains several peptide 
""
Then let us see  the functions of
""
""
So the main function is  they are the building
blocks for  protein
""
 ?
""
Main function building blocks for  protein
""
""
The  main function is the building blocks for proteins
""
That means several peptides or the amino acids  are uh
 constitute the protein molecules
""
That means the main function
""
And another is that is  specific amino acids are
also converted into different types of biologically active compounds 
""
Certain specific amino acids  they biologically convert to form
several biological compounds 
""
For example  it is converted into form of tyrocine
is a amino acid 
""
It is converted into the form  tyrocine
""
""
Tyrocine 
BB-work 
""
Adrinalin  another the skin pigment melanin
""
That is also  that is the skin
pigment 
""
Melanin is the skin pigment
""
You know what is it skin pigment  ?
""
You don't know
""
So that is the skin colour you know we have
""
The  the dark people or black
""
They are having in their skin  the larger quantity
of the melanin pigments 
""
So the 
""
That is the  of these
pigment only  black colour
individually and melanin pigments 
""
 In some cases we have seen that the people they are
not having this melanin pigment
""
Have you seen 
""
So they are known by the name  this such people they are known
albino 
""
Albino 
""
They are lacking the pigment
""
They do not have this melanin pigment
""
That  something
 for
 for the conversion of this pigment
""
For the production of this  pigment
""
Melanine pigment producing 
material  in
their body 
""
That is 
is absent in their body
""
That is 
 having white colour
""
Isn't it  ?
""
Because  uhm
black due the presence of 
""
So in such people they do not have the  ability to produce this
pigment melanin
""
That is why  colourless people or
albino 
""
So another  indole three acetic
 nicotinamide etcetera are also formed from a
tryptophane 
""
The amino acid from amino acid tryptophane 
""
These plants harmone known as  acids
 BB-Work
""
""
 plant
harmone  and the vitamin nicotinamide
""
That is also formed from the amino acids tryptophane 
""
So we know that the main constituent of the glucose is carbon
hydrogen and  oxygen isn't it ?
""
So here in the amino acids carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen is
also there
""
So this here the N H group or the amino group is removed then it
will be converted into glucose 
""
And like that  it
will form the carbon-dioxide 
""
So these are the  functions of amino acids
""
Understand 
""
So next is the nucleotides 
""
So these nucleotides are also complex molecules  forming a part
of the information transfer system in the cells 
""
The  what is information transfer system
 ?
""
What does it mean  ?
""
The transfer of information from cell to cell  nerve
""
transfer system
""
The information will be transferred from cell to cell  that is
the information transfer system 
""
So  basic
units of nucleic acids also
""
You know that nucleic acid 
""
Which are the main nucleic acids  ?
""
The  and the R N A
""
""
""
""
""
What does it mean ?
""
D N A means 
deoxyribo nucleic acid and R N A 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
nucleotides 
""
So these nucleotides also contain carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen
and phosphorus
""
A nucleotide 
 phosphorus
""
""
So each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic  nitrogenous base
apendo 
""
Each nucleotide is made up of  nitrogenous base
""
""
So 
occurring in nucleotides 
pyromidin 
""
So then  tides
are 
""
So the major purines are adanine and a 
BB-writing 
""
So this the major purines are adraline and a  guarine
""
And pyrimidins are  uracil
and the cytocin
""
Thymin 
""
So this uracil is present in  the R N A isn't it ?
""
Uracil that is seen in the 
""
So the apendo is either ribose or deoxyribose 
""
The apendo 
""
So the nucleo  tides are thus called the ribonucleotides or
deoxyribonucleotides 
""
So if  the apendos then
we will say it is a 
""
And if it contains  tide then it is
known as the 
""
For examples of ribonucleotides are 
adrinalic acid 
""
Adrinalic acid is an example for  nucleotide
""
""
An example for 
deoxyribo 
Deoadrinalic acid 
""
So adrinalic acid is an example for 
""
Yes 
""
It is an example for the 
""
Uhn 
""
Adrinalic acid 
""
It is the example of ribonucleotide 
""
Ribonucleotide 
deoxyadrinalic acid 
""
So this ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic acids
or R N A 
""
The  ribonucleic
acids that is R N A and also deoxy  uh
ribonucleotides are the basic units of deoxyribonucleic acids 
""
So that is the D N A 
""
Say a combination of these nitrogenous base is the  pentosugar
""
""
So what is a nucleotide then  ?
""
Nucleotide  ?
""
A nucleotide is formed  a
nitrogenous base 
""
""
""
""
""
That is known as a nucleotide
