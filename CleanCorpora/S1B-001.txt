<I>
""
""
So 
""
""
 body
""
Either plant body or 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They have either 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 animals they are depending on the plants
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
their 
""
That means  other
""
carnivorous animals they are eating herbivorous animals
""
""
""
""
Understand 
""
So this amino acids are  the
""
""
""
""
""
And in some cases  sulphur is also present
""
In some cases the present of 
BB-work 
""
So there may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acids 
""
""
These amino acids may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acid
""
""
""
""
""
So these four valency for the carbon atom  it is attached to one
""
""
""
""
""
So every amino group is a so this amino acids may be  they are
of  BB-work
""
""
""
""
Then what does it mean basic amino acids 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is why they are known as the  basic amino acids
""
""
group and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
neutral amino acids 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
phenylalanine etcetera 
""
Glycine 
""
So these are the three main type of amino acids
""
""
neutral amino acids
""
Understand 
""
Then  these amino acids
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of many amino acids 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is it  ?
""
A peptide is formed 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Understand 
""
""
""
""
""
Or joined together by forming peptide bonds 
""
""
""
""
""
""
A single peptide
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 peptide
""
Okay a single peptide is formed  several amino acids
""
""
Understand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
different 
""
The properties of protein will be different from the properties of
a peptide or peptide bond
""
""
""
""
""
differs from the properties of the  peptide
""
Understand 
""
""
""
""
""
 peptide
""
Understand
""
But protein molecule contains several peptide 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 constitute the protein molecules
""
""
""
""
also converted into different types of biologically active compounds 
""
""
several biological compounds 
""
For example  it is converted into form of tyrocine
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is also  that is the skin
""
""
""
""
You know what is it skin pigment  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of the melanin pigments 
""
So the 
""
That is the  of these
""
""
""
 In some cases we have seen that the people they are
""
""
Have you seen 
""
""
albino 
""
""
""
They are lacking the pigment
""
They do not have this melanin pigment
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
material  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So in such people they do not have the  ability to produce this
""
""
""
albino 
""
""
 nicotinamide etcetera are also formed from a
""
""
The amino acid from amino acid tryptophane 
""
""
""
""
""
 plant
""
""
""
""
""
hydrogen and  oxygen isn't it ?
""
So here in the amino acids carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen is
""
""
So this here the N H group or the amino group is removed then it
""
""
And like that  it
will form the carbon-dioxide 
""
So these are the  functions of amino acids
""
Understand 
""
""
""
So these nucleotides are also complex molecules  forming a part
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The information will be transferred from cell to cell  that is
""
""
""
units of nucleic acids also
""
You know that nucleic acid 
""
Which are the main nucleic acids  ?
""
The  and the R N A
""
""
""
""
""
What does it mean ?
""
D N A means 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
nucleotides 
""
""
and phosphorus
""
""
 phosphorus
""
""
""
apendo 
""
""
""
""
""
occurring in nucleotides 
""
""
So then  tides
""
""
""
""
""
So this the major purines are adraline and a  guarine
""
And pyrimidins are  uracil
""
""
Thymin 
""
""
""
Uracil that is seen in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if it contains  tide then it is
""
""
For examples of ribonucleotides are 
adrinalic acid 
""
Adrinalic acid is an example for  nucleotide
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is an example for the 
""
""
""
""
""
It is the example of ribonucleotide 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ribonucleotides are the basic units of deoxyribonucleic acids 
""
So that is the D N A 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Nucleotide  ?
""
""
nitrogenous base 
""
""
""
""
""
""
