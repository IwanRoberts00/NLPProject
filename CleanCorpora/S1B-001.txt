So proteins are the major BB-work 
 food material that is the important food materials 
which are use used for the growth and development of the
 of body
Either plant body or the animals body 
So these proteins they are the macro molecules 
Proteins they are the BB-work the macro molecules 
So this these proteins can be the
several kinds of amino acids 
Several types of amino acids are present in the protein
molecules 
So in plants the amino acids they obtain from the inorganic
process that's from that means it is from the 
 atmosphere itself 
The plants and also some micro organisms they have the ability to
fix the inorganic nitrogen and to convert it into the amino acid form 
But in the case of these animals they have to depend on the
plants for the amino acid source
The source of amino acids
They have either they have to depend directly or 
indirectly 
What does it mean direct depe uh and the directly
dependent means 
 One-word 
In the case of herbivorous plants uh sorry herbivorous animals
 they have to depend on the animals they are depending on the plants
for their foods 
So they are getting direct ly the food materials from the
plants
understand 
But in carnivores they are directly depending on the plants for
their amino acid source 
That means they are eating this uh flesh of other
animals which are eating the plants or otherwise you can say that
carnivorous animals they are eating herbivorous animals
That means indirectly they we are getting the uh
source of the protein from the plants
Understand 
So this amino acids are the made up of the
components of the amino acids are also carbon BB-work hydrogen
 oxygen and the nitrogen 
Carbon hydrogen oxygen and the nitrogen
And in some cases sulphur is also present
In some cases the present of BB-work sulphur 
BB-work 
So there may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acids 
bearing one or two amino groups 
These amino acids may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acid
bearing one or two amino groups 
That means the you will you will not be know
 knowing that a carbon atom has four valency isn't it 
So these four valency for the carbon atom it is attached to one
amino groups BB-work and to one carboxic group and to one
hydrogen and one to the side chain one to a side chain 
And the side can may be either polar or nonpolar 
So every amino group is a so this amino acids may be they are
of BB-work basic amino acids and acidic BB-work
 and neutral amino acid BB-work 
Basic then acidic and the neutral amino acids
Then what does it mean basic amino acids 
So every amino or group is known as the and amino acids
having a free amino group is known as a basic amino acid
For example lysine and arginine BB-work 
So this lysine and arginine they have it they're having
 one carbocil group and two amino group
One carbocil and a BB-Work and two amino group
That is why they are known as the basic amino acids
And the acidic amino acids they are having one such amino
group and
Two carboxic groups 
And two one Carbocil BB-work one
amino and a two carboxic group
 One 
So they are known as acidic amino acid 
So and another group they are having one amino group and
one carboxic group N H D 
 Carbonic group 
One carboxic and one BB-Work they are known as
neutral amino acids 
For acidic amino acid for example glutonic acid and uh aspartic
acids
Glutonic and aspartic BB-Work 
And for neutral amino acids examples glycine alanin valine 
phenylalanine etcetera BB-Work 
Glycine alanin valine etcetera 
So these are the three main type of amino acids
That is the basic amino acids acidic amino acid and the
neutral amino acids
Understand 
Then if two amino acids can this these amino acids
 can be linked together by means of peptide bond 
Two amino acids they can be linked together
Linked understand linked united together link 
Together like by means of peptide bond peptide bond 
BB-Works 
So like that several peptide bonds to form a linear chain
of many amino acids 
Have you understood that chain
The two amino acids they can be linked together by means of peptide
bond
So like that several bonds will be forming and like that a
linear chain of peptide bonds can be formed 
So these are known by the name together these are known as the
 peptide
It is together form a peptide BB-Work 
So what is a peptide ?
And what what will you say peptide what
is it ?
A peptide is formed by forming 
 By the 
Different parts of the 
By by joining of 
By forming pep several peptide bonds
Understand 
That is peptide bonds are formed in between two amino acids
Two amino acids can be bonded together
Or joined together by forming peptide bonds 
So like that several amino acids will be united or bonded
together to form a linear chain of amino acids
They are known that amino acid molecule is known as the peptide
A single peptide
A peptide is formed by the bonding together of several peptide
bonds
Understand 
That means several amino acids join together forming a
linear chain of bonds known as the peptide bonds
And these linear chains a of molecule
contains a linear chain of these bonds they are known as the not a single
 peptide
Okay a single peptide is formed from several amino acids
joined together or bonded together
Understand 
That is known as a peptide 
So we will uh these proteins are micro molecules formed by 
from a large number of peptide 
That means a protein molecule contains the large number of these
 peptide 
But the function the the structure or the function will be
different 
The properties of protein will be different from the properties of
a peptide or peptide bond
Understand 
That means the protein molecule contains several peptides 
and also the peptide bonds but the properties of the protein
differs from the properties of the peptide
Understand 
Uh we know that a protein molecule contains several peptides but
the properties are different 
 property of the protein is different from the property of the
 peptide
Understand
But protein molecule contains several peptide 
Then let us see the function of the functions of
 amino acids BB-Work 
So the main function is the they are the building
blocks for protein
 That means what what does it mean ?
Main function building blocks for BB- Work protein
The the main function is the building blocks for proteins
That means several peptides or the amino acids are uh
 constitute the protein molecules
That means the main function
And another is that is said the specific amino acids are
also converted into different types of biologically active compounds 
Certain specific amino acids they biologically convert to form
several biological compounds 
For example tyrocine it is converted into form of tyrocine
is a amino acid BB-Work 
It is converted into the form of known as tyrocine
 BB-work 
Tyrocine and a adrinalin that is also a harmone 
BB-work 
Adrinalin and another the skin pigment melanin
That is also melanin BB-Work that is the skin
pigment 
Melanin is the skin pigment
You know what is it skin pigment ?
You don't know
So that is the skin colour you know we have
The the dark people or black
They are having in their skin having the larger quantity
of the melanin pigments 
So the less melanin pigments have the fair colour 
That is the present presence of these
pigment only give the colour that is the black colour
individually and melanin pigments 
 Some In some cases we have seen that the people they are
not having this melanin pigment
Have you seen 
So they are known by the name this such people they are known
albino BB- Work 
Albino 
They are lacking the pigment
They do not have this melanin pigment
That is why they that means the these something
 these amino acids or tyrocine will be lacking in their body for
 for the conversion of this pigment
For the production of this pigment
Melanine pigment producing a materials 
material for blacking blackening in
their body 
That is the pigment the total pigment 
is absent in their body
That is even then why their skin 
 also is having white colour
Isn't it ?
Because our this uh our hair is uhm
black due the presence of this melanin pigment 
So in such people they do not have the ability to produce this
pigment melanin
That is why they look colourless colourless people or
albino 
So another uhm this plant harmone indole three acetic
 acid and vitamin nicotinamide etcetera are also formed from a
tryptophane BB-Work 
The amino acid from amino acid tryptophane 
These plants harmone known as indole three acetic acids
 and the vitamin nicotinamide etcetra are formed BB-Work
 Indole three acetic acids that is a plant
harmone and the vitamin nicotinamide
That is also formed from the amino acids tryptophane 
So we know that the main constituent of the glucose is carbon
hydrogen and oxygen isn't it ?
So here in the amino acids carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen is
also there
So this here the N H group or the amino group is removed then it
will be converted into glucose 
And like that the carbo-oxyl group can be removed then it
will form the carbon-dioxide 
So these are the functions of amino acids
Understand 
So next is the nucleotides BB-Work 
So these nucleotides are also complex molecules forming a part
of the information transfer system in the cells 
The inform what is information transfer system
 ?
What does it mean ?
The transfer of information from cell to cell or nerve
 from the nerve impulses like that that is the information 
transfer system
The information will be transferred from cell to cell that is
the information transfer system 
So they the they are the basic
units of nucleic acids also
You know that nucleic acid 
Which are the main nucleic acids ?
The D N A and the R N A
 D N A 
What does it mean ?
D N A means what does it mean power 
deoxyribo nucleic acid and R N A ribose nucleic acid 
 Power 
 Ribose 
So the basic unit of nucleic acids are the 
nucleotides 
So these nucleotides also contain carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen
and phosphorus
A nucleotide when are contained contains 
 carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and a phosphorus
So each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base
apendo and one two three phosphate group 
Each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base
 apendo and uh one two three phosphate group 
So the the nitrogenous base is BB-work 
occurring in nucleotides are they may be either purine or 
pyromidin BB-writing 
So then nitrogenous bases occurring in the nucleo tides
are they may be either a purine or a pyromidin 
So the major purines are adanine and a guarine 
BB-writing 
So this the major purines are adraline and a guarine
And pyrimidins are BB-writing thymine uracil
and the cytocin
Thymin BB-writing uracil and cytocin 
So this uracil is present in the R N A isn't it ?
Uracil that is seen in the R N A 
So the apendo is either ribose or deoxyribose 
The apendo that may be either ribose or deoxyribose 
So the nucleo tides are thus called the ribonucleotides or
deoxyribonucleotides 
So if a nucleotide contains ribose the apendos then
we will say it is a ribo nucleotide 
And if it contains a deoxy ribonucleo tide then it is
known as the deoxyribonucleotide 
For examples of ribonucleotides are adrinalic acid 
adrinalic acid BB-writing 
Adrinalic acid is an example for ribonuclei nucleotide
An example for deoxyribonucleic nucleotide is the 
deoxyribo nucleic acid that is the deoadrinalic acid 
Deoadrinalic acid BB-writing 
So adrinalic acid is an example for 
Yes 
It is an example for the 
Uhn 
Adrinalic acid 
It is the example of ribonucleotide 
Ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide example 
deoxyadrinalic acid 
So this ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic acids
or R N A 
The ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic
acids that is R N A and also deoxy nuc uh
ribonucleotides are the basic units of deoxyribonucleic acids 
So that is the D N A 
Say a combination of these nitrogenous base is the pentosugar
 is known as a nucleo tide 
So what is a nucleotide then ?
Nucleotide BB-writing nucleotide what is it ?
A nucleotide is formed by the combination of a
nitrogenous base with a pentose sugar 
 A nitrogenous base 
That is known as a nucleotide
