<I>
Yes 
So 
Just two of you you tell me what you want to talk about
 laughter 
 
I 
Can we talk something about the situation in these days 
 
Yeah 
Actually you say something what do you think
Like uhm actually why the real fighting is going on
between Naga and Kuki I don't know the reason yet 
You don't know ?
Uhm 
They are different uh people different people they
have different reas uh versions about it
Uhm 
The way I know it is that uh now these Kukis are nomads
Uhm 
And they don't have a particular territorial area
Uhm
And what's happened is in in the Manipur area of
 uh these Naga people the Tamkuls the Kuki people have come and
settled 
And now they they are in encroaching in the into the
Naga areas 
Uhm
And so the Nagas are defend defending their place 
 
So we'll deal 
No we've started 
 Started 
 
You started uh 
Yeah 
So anyway you can just sit and uh laughter 
 
You can do this 
So like I've just I don't know what
happened between uh I mean in our place the situation right now so I am
asking her to ex one word explain
I was trying to explain atleast my idea of what I feel is
going on 
 That's one reason okay like uh this Kukis are
encroaching on the Tamkul land so the Tamkuls are retaliating 
That that is defending themselves 
Then another one is that uhm this Anasian people were
taking taxes from the Kukis 
Oh 
And now the Kukis they refused to uh pay any more 
And so they are moving against them 
Uhm 
Like that 
 
For that only 
Yeah mainly and that is how it all started because
they said that we won't pay anymore
 
But this Tamkul no they are Naga 
They are Nagas 
 
 That's what 
Now what's happened is that the the Nagas before
 there was no Nagaland 
They said it's only in the last uh nineteen
sixty-two or three that the Nagaland was formed 
So each Naga group just lived in in their within each
Naga group has got the particular territorial area and we live like that
So like the Aungs we have our place the 
Angami's have their place like that Tamkuls they have their place
Uhm 
And when statehood was given to us then uh they did
not uh put all the places together but uh like much of the Naga
tribes are now in Manipur there are some tribes in Arunachal Pradesh 
some in Assam like that 
And so now one of the demands of this uh the Nationalists
groups that are coming up is that the greater Nagaland 
Greater Nagaland means all this should be integrated
Uhm 
And when it happens then large a large chunk of uh 
Manipur also will come to Nagaland
Oh 
And this was passed in the Assembly uh two months back 
that Nagaland government also will try to do this and Manipur government has
started noise so uh Tamkuls uh the Mar Mar 
Marams announce like that
 
 Two words 
Yeah they are Nagas in Manipur 
This was like the fighting is going on in for a month
Ha 
They used to means people used to think that it's
 happening in Nagaland because always Naga and Kuki Naga and Kuki
Yeah that's true 
Uh then
Actually the fighting is going on in Imphal over
Yeah
 
 It's not in in Nagaland 
Nagaland it is 
 It means between this Kuki and Nagas 
yeah so far the clashes are going on means this killing and all
are going on only in that place not
 Yeah 
In the hill areas of Manipur 
 
 In that respect Nagaland 
It doesn't affect Nagaland much
Yeah 
 
Ah ah so it affects only Manipur 
 Right for example 
When they say Naga means we think that some Angami 
 Aau or some people of eastern parts or uh one word 
 so far no one is in the one word only Tamkul 
 Like two words 
 That's why I was wondering why
Uhm
But 
The after effect of course in Nagaland is where many of the
Kukis in Nagaland are being uh quite a number have been actually killed
Oh 
So one Tamkul one shot one director
Uhm 
And then uh one Kuki I A S officer was also shot
Uhm 
And uh just before I came and after I came also two Kukis were
shot like that 
But it's a spill over from Manipur 
 
Kukis they stay in Nagaland itself 
They are spread all over the place 
 
 All over it 
So they are recognised as one of the tribes in uh Nagaland
But they don't have a specific area in Nagaland
Means they don't have a motherland 
They don't have a particualr area like we do 
So they are there in Manipur they are there in uh Mizoram 
and uh in Nagaland and also in Assam half long area 
laughter 
Any more questions 
So 
 One word what do you want to talk about now 
laughs 
How is your further politics ? laughter

Uhm 
So 
So when you go back to uh Shillong do you think you'll
 be able to apply your these ideas ?

 Laughter 
 You'll two words more like that

Okay then what about Keri ?
I really don't have any idea about my job laughs
 but as far as my subject is concerned I think I prefer working
outside outside our place and
Ah ha
 
Yeah but that's 
Outside uh so what one word 
 Now in our place there is no electronics
department now
Uhm
So like I will try to pick up all those uh
competitive exams no and all I will keep on trying laughter 
Till you get one laughter 
Till I have one job from outside laughter 
So what are the different uh things that you are trying
for right now ?
Right now like I am not trying for any exam like

So you have any idea what you are going to uh apply for ?
See like I may write GATES also 
Uhm uhm
And I don't know whether G R E is there in Guwahati or
not 
Perhaps not sure
 If it is there I will try the one word
 or
 
 I think it is there 
So you will try from Guwahati mainly ?
Yeah means I don't want to come back here to just like uh
 I will just get those materials and I'll prepare for more and I
like Guwahati laughs 
Yeah Guwahati atleast is quite close enough 
But I am not sure whether it's Guwahati is the
centre or not
Uhm 
I don't think yaar 
 
Calcutta 
But GATES is there
Uh 
GATES is there 
 
Yeah GATES GATES is there 
Both 
 
Uhm 
But you better try G R E also 
Means ?
Uh like if I prepare for GATES it's only same G
R E both are uh like the syllabus and all
 
In fact GATES is tougher than G R E 
Yeah 
 
So 
Oh GATES is tougher
 
Uhm 
Then what about uh plans to go abroad TOEFL and all these
 laughs 
Hey which two words was doing
Yeah it was not so 
 
But if you are writing GRE of course 
 Yeah GRE also is same but uhm

 Uhm 
Uhm so you are not interested in going abroad ? 
Laughter 
Of course it's intrested but it's a bit 
difficult for me laughter 
 
For me going abroad uh I think 
 It's your dream
 
Going for enjoyment only not for studies laughter 
Not for studies or a job uhn
 
Yes I think rose and all 
 It's rose why why actually rose laughter
 
I must be a fan of one word 
But of course if uh if I get a job in our place I prefer
that one what I feel is that I don't think
Uhm
Because there is no department also 
 
But of course 
 One word I will try in my place
In Naga in Nagaland
Yeah
So will you take uh which one would you prefer uh 
lower job in Nagaland or a higer paid job outside of Nagaland 
Uhm it depends but suppose like uhn if the
salary is at at around uh three thousand in Nagaland
Uhm uhm
And may be there is ten thousand in outside
Uhm
I will prefer the three thousand in Nagaland 
 
Yeah laughter 
Yeah because 
Yeah that's laughter 
Uhm but as far as this status is concerned 
uhm uhm of course high one also even though it's outside
doesn't matter much laughter 
 Uhm uhm 
But first preference is on Nagaland uhn laughter 
 
Yeah that's right 
Uhm 
 
As if you have laughter 
I think economic so that I can always try laughter
 
You must always have hope na 
Yeah they did it's not that we are going to be
 one word just hoping and dreaming know laughter 
Yeah nothing nothing wrong with that 
What about the empty zones say the UPSC exams neither
of you are interested
 
No 
Not very much also but 
 
I am not interested in any exam laughter 
Who knows who might get again we might change change our
mind also to laughter

But right now I don't have any plans 
Uhm I knew you seem to be quite sure what you want to do
both of you laughter 
No this is just laughter Recording broken
 laughter Okay uhm did you have a very unique
kind of system isn't that among the Khasis where marriage is
concerned
 
Uhm 
So can you uh tell us something about uh how 
what kind of uh what rituals or formalities that you observe and all
this 
 
You mean after marriage ?

You have the matriarchal system na like
where do your the woman is the more dominant in the family
