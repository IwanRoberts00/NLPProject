discuss  the most reveting diplomatic
engagement  over
""
""
This is a subject  the entire
 six weeks I should think
""
""
And uh  it came to almost a nail biting
finish  with the fate of the resolution
""
The Pakistan sponsored resolution  for
alleged Human Rights violation in Kashmir  becoming a subject of
international attention 
""
And  uh in this
country  international pressure
 Iran and
China in particular  uh withdrew the resolution
""
And  need
necessarily be interpreted as  a victory or defeat
""
But it was question of uh larger Third World solidarity  that uh
was established in Geneva
""
And  at the end of the
Geneva Conference was that certain issues like this  perhaps which will
 uh through bi-lateral negotiations
""
This gives a completely new opening 
the fallout of Geneva  what is being
what is the reason  other
member countries of the  United Nations Human Rights Commission
""
Uh  we have uh a
very distinguished panel here today 
""
Uh Mr Salman Khursheed 
almost uh I would say battled  to prevent the uh
Pakistani 
""
Uh despite the fact that Pakistan has  uh
scored over us on occassion and in the diplomatic arena  been uh
very very 
""
And next to Mr Khursheed is Mr S K Singh  former Foreign
Secretary who has also dealt with Pakistan for a very long time
""
I think 
itself uhm as 
""
""
I started in fifty-nine 
""
""
In fifty-nine
""
""
""
""
""
A very long time 
""
And  senior
journalist with Aligarh background 
on national and international affairs 
""
""
""
Salman uh  time and
again  how did we do it ?
""
""
From start till the end 
by we finish this eager expections on  hand
 preparing ourselves for
defeat 
""
There was a sentiment that so what even if the resolution 
target 
""
So we work absolutely short
""
""
So could you tell us little background of this
""
How is that  ?
""
""
So  I
uh  I I was quite confident I think our whole team was quite confident
that 
""
A clear margin right upto the last date 
""
Uh perhaps on the day of the voting  the morning of the voting
 a little bit
""
A couple of people  perhaps due to last
munute instruction
""
But  uh
which was significant
""
And I think important in  leading to the situation which finally
led to uh withdrawl 
""
Uh but I think what is significant is the support that we had from
the European Union 
""
Uh largely 
ambassadors had 
""
And also the support we had in the  where
it became very clear  of discussions we
had 
""
And certainly the resolution of the  Karachi was not
going to be 
""
I think that  uh the effort by
Pakistan  uh people
that they could win
""
""
But you know there has been suggestion from the Pakistani side
 feel that
actually 
""
The so called deal  that India was supposed to have struck with
Iran and China 
""
Uh and  the balance that
Pakistan 
""
How far is that correct ?
""
""
Well I  not quite sure that I wouldn't have
said the same thing if I was in their shoes going back to their country
""
Uhm I want to make it absolutely clear 
that there was no deal 
""
We didn't meet  Iran or China any more than we met the other
countries 
""
We talked uh very openly 
""
All that Iran did 
""
 Pakistan said was adjournment being asked by uh
 Iran
""
And Iran said it was being asked by Pakistan  was they rang us
and said want to make a statement  to which there will be a response from
Pakistan and they will withdraw 
""
We said  there are a few point
on which we will object 
""
Uh we don't allow anybody to say that  about the situation in
Kashmir 
""
For the rest if you have something with Pakistan 
sit and listen to it
""
But  or
bilateral agreement on this 
""
And that was it  uh China picked it up
""
""
Clearly lot of them said was this is a bilateral matter
""
It should remain in the bilateral plain 
""
Pakistan then said  uh we don't want any
further actions on our motion 
""
That was it 
""
""
Mr Singh do you think that uh  there could have been
something more than what Salman is saying ?
""
""
No I don't uh I don't believe that  I I from my experience
""
""
Let me remind you 
""
After that end of the  of the UN General
Assembly 
""
Immediately forty-seven or forty-eight or fifty missions  sent
to all members uh capitals of all members 
""
Then the Prime Minister identified herself  Prime Minister of
Pakistan  completion
of her 
""
And thereafter she goes there herself 
""
Then all this feverish statements being made all over Pakistan 
all over their media 
then they hoping that it would 
""
And then what happens  towards the end they withdraw their
pivotal of sentence on which they had 
""
That is to send a 
India's 
""
Then that is withdrawn
""
And then 
""
Actually I think China and uh Iran  good very good friends of
ours and 
totalling 
""
Because I I came in here as a minister 
Pakistan would have lost this 
""
Now 
""
Because internationalising this  a kind of
chain reaction 
""
It took it to Human Rights  then take it to the General
Assembly
""
And then in the General Assembly nudge it to the Security Council
""
""
That was the game plan  and I won't be surprised if it remains a
game plan 
""
""
Not  we shouldn't become complacent
as S K has rightly emphasised
""
But the question that  that
whether in fact there was a withdrawl 
""
Taken into view a withdrawl on which I wish the minister would shed
some light because some people say  that at the very last minute the
chairman  what is
being deferred  that Iranians made a short speech because we objected
""
for this uh session 
""
Now what is that the we 
""
""
Well you know uh what you do with a resolution  is that the
resolution is voted  uh upon if the sponsor insist that there should be a
vote 
""
Once a resolution is accepted  then it gets on to the record
""
And a resolution of the kind they wanted 
serving resolution  that automatically will repeat itself every year with
a report but 
""
What uh  apart from
defeating it is to bring a no-action motion 
""
Uh which is not the preferred instrument now  lot of countries
in the West 
through through indirect uh 
""
So  thought of a no-action motion
""
We wanted to be  uh attitude
""
We wanted to be consistent with openness 
""
And we said nothing to hide 
""
 let the best man win
""
""
What Iran has said  uh uh request the
Pakistan to withdraw 
""
I had said then that the commission be  treat this matter as
closed 
""
What the chairman did  was to take the request to Pakistan to be
the operative part of the request to the commission 
""
And therefore rule so 
""
We immediately protested  and I must give credit to Iran and I
think this is an act of courage 
""
Because actually what they could have said  well we try to
help  no fault of ours
""
""
Iran took courage  instantly in his act
""
The ambassador uh  look
what I said sir 
action 
""
""
So obviously there was no choice 
""
""
Uh chairman said  if that is the case
""
""
Everybody clapped and it was over 
""
That if  in of resolution that can
leave on after this  to uh uh be back uh to haunt till next year
""
But of course this week  like anybody else we are going in for
new resolution
""
""
Well one thing Chandran 
""
Uh to this question  there
was another resolution pssed by consensus 
 on this two
aspects of our problem  inserted
into India etcetera etcetera 
 and the human rights question on the
other hand 
""
Human rights question is wiped off 
""
During the session terrorism thing  stand as a decision of the
commission
""
""
""
""
""
Rasheed would you agree that the Human Rights  question
has been wiped off  ?
""
""
Well I think these are technicalities  what the minister
has just said may be right on it 
""
But I think  we should
""
""
""
""
""
As we were saying earlier  that we should not become
complacent
""
Because  at
various other forum  what is going to be our strategy
""
In other words  and
what should we do  take care of it next time
""
""
""
Right 
""
Yes Salman I I think one question as writer point of view
commented that perhaps  uh it has
been a great achievement  this is not going to stop Pakistan
 uh Kashmir that is that is the
possession  we
double 
""
Now do 
going to confront this in future  ?
""
""
Well on two things  I would like to say one uh which uh I
would uh point you  notice
""
Because he has  bilateral work
""
Uh 
there was a danger and there always is in a vote of anything happening 
""
Uh the important thing is that if we had  uh ten
or twelve people would have voted 
""
But the margins would not have been great  we would not
necessarily have known how the others felt 
""
They would abstain it 
""
Pakistan could have again said it they were abstaining but they
were in our favour 
""
We could have got one or two  perhaps explanations of vote that
could indicate what the mood was 
""
But what happened in this uh event  was that many country spoke
""
""
That this should remain bilateral it should not come in  two
words 
""
I think this was a significant victory and I think 
to take 
""
Uhm  you
know between India and Pakistan 
""
Uhm  the the second important think really is the transparency
""
""
It was not just practical transparency to ward off a resolution
""
""
It is a policy consistent policy  has input
at every level ministry of home  decision at the
highest level in our country the prime 
""
That we must be open and we must be transparent 
""
We must not hide 
""
And if there is something wrong  the transparency will bring it
to our notice as well 
""
I think this was appreciated  a
few words  ambassadors
""
It was commented upon  in a statement made by Greece on behalf
of EU
""
And in our international bilateraly  this was a crucial thing
 which turned the mood in our favour
""
And uh
