<I>
 We're assembled here this evening to 
discuss the aftermath or perhaps the most reveting diplomatic
engagement involving India and Pakistan on over
 that Kashmir issue 
This is a subject which has really engaged the entire
 sub-continent's attention for almost uh six weeks I should think
And uh towards the end it came to almost a nail biting
finish with the fate of the resolution
The Pakistan sponsored resolution uh condemning India for
alleged Human Rights violation in Kashmir becoming a subject of
international attention 
And it has been uh sort of great satisfaction uh in this
country that at the end of a day under uh international pressure
 particularly pressure from other Third World countries Iran and
China in particular that Pakistan uh withdrew the resolution
And uh it is it's not quite something that need
necessarily be interpreted as a victory or defeat
But it was question of uh larger Third World solidarity that uh
was established in Geneva
And the another major point that came out at the end of the
Geneva Conference was that certain issues like this perhaps which will
 be resolved uh through bi-lateral negotiations
This gives a completely new opening and to discuss uh 
the fallout of Geneva how we move forward from here and what is being
what is the reason why India was ultimately able to pursue other
member countries of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
Uh to support that the Indian position of this we have uh a
very distinguished panel here today 
Uh Mr Salman Khursheed the hero of Geneva who has uh 
almost uh I would say battled night and day to prevent the uh
Pakistani uh diplomatic victory in Geneva 
Uh despite the fact that Pakistan has uh in the past uh
scored over us on occassion and in the diplomatic arena it's been uh
very very one word achievement Salman 
And next to Mr Khursheed is Mr S K Singh former Foreign
Secretary who has also dealt with Pakistan for a very long time
I think uh uh apart from having spent time in Pakistan 
itself uhm as 
I started in fifty-nine 
In fifty-nine
 One or two words 
A very long time 
And we've also with us Mr Rasheed Talib senior
journalist with Aligarh background who has also been uh a commentor 
on national and international affairs 
 I'll start with Salman 
Salman uh the question that has uh occured to me time and
again is how did we do it ?
From start till the end I think there was a scale 
by we finish this eager expections on one one hand
 on the other hand we were also kind of uh preparing ourselves for
defeat 
There was a sentiment that so what even if the resolution 
target pass have its own fault 
So we work absolutely short
So could you tell us little background of this
How is that we how was this achieved ?
So I've my own amnesia laughter I
uh I I was quite confident I think our whole team was quite confident
that we had uh a margin 
A clear margin right upto the last date 
Uh perhaps on the day of the voting the morning of the voting
 uh we sleep a little bit
A couple of people uh slipped perhaps due to last
munute instruction
But it was our margin that we maintained throughout uh
which was significant
And I think important in leading to the situation which finally
led to uh withdrawl 
Uh but I think what is significant is the support that we had from
the European Union 
Uh largely because of the report that one word 
ambassadors had had given them 
And also the support we had in the O I C group where
it became very clear after the first few rounds of of discussions we
had that they were not going to take a unified single position 
And certainly the resolution of the O I C Karachi was not
going to be uh the guiding sort of spirit of their decision 
I think that broke the back really off uh the effort by
Pakistan to get the momentum uh that could convince uh people
that they could win
But you know there has been suggestion from the Pakistani side
 and I think there are people in this country too who uh feel that
actually how we managed it was the deal 
The so called deal that India was supposed to have struck with
Iran and China 
Uh and that's what really tilted uh the balance that
Pakistan was have was forced to withdraw 
How far is that correct ?
Well I I'm not quite sure that I wouldn't have
said the same thing if I was in their shoes going back to their country
Uhm I want to make it absolutely clear absolutely clear 
that there was no deal no negotiation no settlement 
We didn't meet Iran or China any more than we met the other
countries 
We talked uh very openly and we talked about our position 
All that Iran did at the time when they ask for adjournment 
 One word Pakistan said was adjournment being asked by uh
 Iran
And Iran said it was being asked by Pakistan was they rang us
and said want to make a statement to which there will be a response from
Pakistan and they will withdraw 
We said uh lest you waste your breath there are a few point
on which we will object 
Uh we don't allow anybody to say that about the situation in
Kashmir 
For the rest if you have something with Pakistan we'll 
sit and listen to it
But we're not repeat not part of any tripartite or
bilateral agreement on this 
And that was it they made a statement uh China picked it up
 others spoke 
Clearly lot of them said was this is a bilateral matter
It should remain in the bilateral plain 
Pakistan then said we agree uh we don't want any
further actions on our motion 
That was it 
Mr Singh do you think that uh there could have been
something more than what Salman is saying ?
No I don't uh I don't believe that I I from my experience
 Pakistan after the kind of efforts it made 
Let me remind you third committee resolution withdraw 
After that end of the the session of the UN General
Assembly 
Immediately forty-seven or forty-eight or fifty missions sent
to all members uh capitals of all members 
Then the Prime Minister identified herself Prime Minister of
Pakistan identified herself with this dark project as completion
of her father's work 
And thereafter she goes there herself 
Then all this feverish statements being made all over Pakistan 
all over their media and her the pitch getting higher and higher 
then they hoping that it would encourage the militants in the Valley 
And then what happens towards the end they withdraw their
pivotal of sentence on which they had based their entire strategy 
That is to send a self finding mission against 
India's wishes into a good part of India 
Then that is withdrawn
And then they one word 
Actually I think China and uh Iran good very good friends of
ours and much better friends of Pakistan gave them and 
totalling or to save their face 
Because I I came in here as a minister that uh that uh 
Pakistan would have lost this 
Now why it happened is something we must generalise 
Because internationalising this dispute has a kind of
chain reaction 
It took it to Human Rights then take it to the General
Assembly
And then in the General Assembly nudge it to the Security Council
That was the game plan and I won't be surprised if it remains a
game plan for future 
Not complacently we shouldn't become complacent
as S K has rightly emphasised
But the question that a lot of people ask I guess that
whether in fact there was a withdrawl 
Taken into view a withdrawl on which I wish the minister would shed
some light because some people say that at the very last minute the
chairman of it was the Dutch chairman who said what is
being deferred that Iranians made a short speech because we objected
 and uh eventually he said it is not on the agenda 
for this uh session 
Now what is that the we a few words 
Well you know uh what you do with a resolution is that the
resolution is voted uh upon if the sponsor insist that there should be a
vote uh it could be defeated it could be accepted 
Once a resolution is accepted then it gets on to the record
And a resolution of the kind they wanted was self 
serving resolution that automatically will repeat itself every year with
a report but uh serving from a fact finding instruments on 
What uh you can do to kill a resolution apart from
defeating it is to bring a no-action motion 
Uh which is not the preferred instrument now lot of countries
in the West preferring not to uh to block action as it works 
through through indirect uh sort of method 
So we've not uh thought of a no-action motion
We wanted to be consistent without transparency uh attitude
We wanted to be consistent with openness 
And we said nothing to hide no blocks 
 Let's face it in uh openly let the best man win
What Iran has said was specifically uh uh request the
Pakistan to withdraw 
I had said then that the commission be treat this matter as
closed after Pakistan withdraw it 
What the chairman did was to take the request to Pakistan to be
the operative part of the request to the commission 
And therefore rule so 
We immediately protested and I must give credit to Iran and I
think this is an act of courage 
Because actually what they could have said well we try to
help but it was ambiguous you know it's no fault of ours
 
Iran took courage instantly in his act
The ambassador uh one or two word said look
what I said sir was that this matter be treated as closed no 
action no further action period 
So obviously there was no choice 
Uh chairman said yes I agree if that is the case
 then no-action period 
Everybody clapped and it was over 
That if no any more in of resolution that can
leave on after this to uh uh be back uh to haunt till next year
But of course this week like anybody else we are going in for
new resolution
Well one thing Chandran 
Uh to this question that during this very session there
was another resolution pssed by consensus that was anti-terrorist 
 ahn right and therefore in this particular session on this two
aspects of our problem terrorism which is being injected inserted
into India etcetera etcetera ex exported 
 into India on the one hand and the human rights question on the
other hand 
Human rights question is wiped off 
During the session terrorism thing stand as a decision of the
commission
 Ahn right 
Rasheed would you agree that the Human Rights question
has been wiped off ?
Well I think these are technicalities what the minister
has just said may be right on it that's what happened 
But I think we should
 A few words 
As we were saying earlier that we should not become
complacent
Because it's likely to come up again at
various other forum and if it does what is going to be our strategy
In other words what was a strategy that worked here and
what should we do in order to you know take care of it next time
Right 
Yes Salman I I think one question as writer point of view
commented that perhaps okay we've succeeded uh it has
been a great achievement but uh this is not going to stop Pakistan
 from its attempt to internationalise uh Kashmir that is that is the
possession uh because uh having a democracy existing then we we
double the effort 
Now do we've a game plan as to how we're 
going to confront this in future ?
Well on two things I would like to say one uh which uh I
would uh point you through S K's notice
Because he has far great experience of bilateral work
Uh which is that despite our confidence that we would win 
there was a danger and there always is in a vote of anything happening 
Uh the important thing is that if we had had a vote uh ten
or twelve people would have voted 
But the margins would not have been great we would not
necessarily have known how the others felt 
They would abstain it 
Pakistan could have again said it they were abstaining but they
were in our favour 
We could have got one or two perhaps explanations of vote that
could indicate what the mood was 
But what happened in this uh event was that many country spoke
 and expressively stated that this was a bilateral matter 
That this should remain bilateral it should not come in two
words of an atmosphere of a place like Human Rights Commission 
I think this was a significant victory and I think we've 
to take a cue from this 
Uhm in terms of strategy not victory in terms of you
know between India and Pakistan 
Uhm the the second important think really is the transparency
It was not just practical transparency to ward off a resolution
It is a policy consistent policy which uh has has input
at every level ministry of home ministry of defence decision at the
highest level in our country the prime minister's level 
That we must be open and we must be transparent 
We must not hide if there is nothing to hide 
And if there is something wrong the transparency will bring it
to our notice as well 
I think this was appreciated commented upon by the a
few words ambassadors
It was commented upon in a statement made by Greece on behalf
of EU
And in our international bilateraly this was a crucial thing
 which turned the mood in our favour
And uh this is really something that we needed to
