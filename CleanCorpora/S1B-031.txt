This is a subject  the entire
""
""
""
""
finish  with the fate of the resolution
""
""
alleged Human Rights violation in Kashmir  becoming a subject of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh through bi-lateral negotiations
""
This gives a completely new opening 
""
""
member countries of the  United Nations Human Rights Commission
""
""
very distinguished panel here today 
""
""
almost uh I would say battled  to prevent the uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
itself uhm as 
""
""
I started in fifty-nine 
""
""
In fifty-nine
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  senior
journalist with Aligarh background 
""
""
""
""
Salman uh  time and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There was a sentiment that so what even if the resolution 
""
""
So we work absolutely short
""
""
So could you tell us little background of this
""
""
""
""
""
uh  I I was quite confident I think our whole team was quite confident
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which was significant
""
""
led to uh withdrawl 
""
Uh but I think what is significant is the support that we had from
""
""
Uh largely 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that they could win
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well I  not quite sure that I wouldn't have
""
""
Uhm I want to make it absolutely clear 
""
""
""
countries 
""
We talked uh very openly 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Pakistan and they will withdraw 
""
We said  there are a few point
""
""
""
""
""
For the rest if you have something with Pakistan 
""
""
But  or
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
further actions on our motion 
""
""
""
""
Mr Singh do you think that uh  there could have been
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
After that end of the  of the UN General
""
""
Immediately forty-seven or forty-eight or fifty missions  sent
""
""
Then the Prime Minister identified herself  Prime Minister of
""
""
""
""
""
Then all this feverish statements being made all over Pakistan 
all over their media 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then that is withdrawn
""
""
""
""
ours and 
""
""
Because I I came in here as a minister 
""
""
Now 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then in the General Assembly nudge it to the Security Council
""
""
That was the game plan  and I won't be surprised if it remains a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
whether in fact there was a withdrawl 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And a resolution of the kind they wanted 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in the West 
through through indirect uh 
""
So  thought of a no-action motion
""
We wanted to be  uh attitude
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
closed 
""
What the chairman did  was to take the request to Pakistan to be
the operative part of the request to the commission 
""
And therefore rule so 
""
We immediately protested  and I must give credit to Iran and I
think this is an act of courage 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
what I said sir 
""
""
""
So obviously there was no choice 
""
""
Uh chairman said  if that is the case
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But of course this week  like anybody else we are going in for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Human rights question is wiped off 
""
During the session terrorism thing  stand as a decision of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
has just said may be right on it 
""
But I think  we should
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In other words  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
commented that perhaps  uh it has
""
 uh Kashmir that is that is the
""
double 
""
""
going to confront this in future  ?
""
""
""
would uh point you  notice
""
Because he has  bilateral work
""
""
there was a danger and there always is in a vote of anything happening 
""
""
or twelve people would have voted 
""
But the margins would not have been great  we would not
""
""
They would abstain it 
""
""
""
""
We could have got one or two  perhaps explanations of vote that
""
""
""
""
""
That this should remain bilateral it should not come in  two
""
""
""
to take 
""
""
know between India and Pakistan 
""
""
""
""
It was not just practical transparency to ward off a resolution
""
""
It is a policy consistent policy  has input
""
highest level in our country the prime 
""
""
""
""
""
And if there is something wrong  the transparency will bring it
""
""
I think this was appreciated  a
""
""
It was commented upon  in a statement made by Greece on behalf
of EU
""
""
 which turned the mood in our favour
