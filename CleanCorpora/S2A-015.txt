But fails to beat  a
free hit to  on the
hit in 
""
""
Nearly twenty one minutes of play gone through  Air India
""
""
Score in the seventeenth minutes of first half by Aranha  and
for the continuation of commentary in Hindi 
""
""
""
""
""
Abhay I would just like to say one thing 
interrupt land 
""
For the Air India team 
Edgar Mascarenhas 
""
But these are the two players who besides being  playing as
defendants they are always leading the attack 
""
And they are always keeping them forward on the move  whereas
 a few
words 
""
Ah Ramsharan Gundeep 
""
They have not been able to combine well  whereas the Air India
forward 
""
They just get hardly chance 
""
They would have been thrown up but for Aranha  that you cast in
last line  and centrally
 I don't know whether you agree with me or not
""
""
Punjab Sindh bank having  five internationals is
kill their act
""
But I think over confident must have started with that 
""
And this is what you are paying for your over confidence 
""
And so far they have not been able to combine well and all the
players played so far 
""
Before we leave on 
""
I was considering they got just four chances 
""
And out of the four chances 
""
Fourth one was Edward Aranha 
otherwise the goal keeper was awake 
""
To me it appears the Punjab Sind bank defence  does not know
what 
""
They are running everywhere 
""
Who lies the whole side  Rajesh
Chouhan  all coming
into the attack 
""
They come into the attack and immediately don't go back 
""
That only shows their partners their thinking  the
Punjab Sindh bank boys 
""
The 
""
And they are more uh 
""
If Ramsharan gets the ball  he
doesn't look for a opening they are along with him 
""
Same is the case with  they have got a
very good chance 
""
A swing way down the 
""
And from here specially 
""
Once they go after the back line  they are tied because they
can't do it 
""
Now here is the Punjab players  crease
""
""
The leading team has to prove  playing
final of the  third Lala Bhim Sain memorial invitation hockey tournament
""
""
Venue of many international tournament 
""
The Punjab Sindh bank  no
strategy is being formed 
""
Again on your  In
Hindi 
""
""
Punjab Sindh bank going 
""
Now the second half will start 
""
""
Abhay 
""
""
""
""
""
In fact Punjab Sindh bank  very
well 
""
""
Played very well 
""
""
For them it is demoralising 
""
In second half  have to see whether they would be
able to 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Because  that the Punjab Sindh bank
won't come back into the game 
""
They have the capacity  but the
only thing is 
and 
""
""
Here are they Air India team on the screen  and number
eight 
""
""
Where 
""
""
This Rajinder Amar  right side of the screen
 and right in the
middle with the  on the right is T S Bullard the
international umpire  another
international umpire 
""
Now there goes the scene form  I shall
""
""
The Punjab Sindh bank team being introduced to him 
""
This is Narender 
""
Sorry  Kukoo
Walia 
""
And now 
""
""
Edgar Mascarenhas  the
former Lieutenant Governor  to his team mates from Air
India 
""
""
The four teams presented with the souvenir of this tournament
""
""
""
All there is over  take their
respective places 
""
Punjab Sindh bank will attack from right to left 
""
Now already down by three goals 
""
They will have to work very hard  to get back into the game
""
""
And the morals of the Air India boys 
""
And one thing very notable that the Air India defences  they
are marking their players 
""
They are not letting the rafter Gundeep and uh 
""
Ball on to the side  the passing would be
given to one of them 
""
All the attempt of  to pass on the ball
 are being frustrated by
the  passing by the defenders
""
""
Air India to 
""
Edward Aranha  with the ball the one who scored the first two
goals in the seventeen and twenty-third minutes  the third goal coming of
that stick of Rajesh Chauhan  the first half
itself 
""
Back pass  for
Clive 
""
""
""
Good take work 
""
To Darryl Darryl gives it to  Edgar now from
there to Rajesh Chauhan  fine play by goalkeeper
Teja 
""
Corner hit  by him
""
Mascarenhas 
""
Between the 
""
Aimless forward pass 
""
Ripudaman  Pasha side
by umpire Kukoo Walia 
""
Free hit for Air India

First hit for the in the first second half itself by  Punjab
Sindh bank 
""
But lets see

India ball with 
forward to Aranha Aranha to
