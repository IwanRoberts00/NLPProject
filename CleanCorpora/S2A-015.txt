Down comes Gundeep gives it to Ramsharan Ramsharan
down to left flank 
But fails to beat Surinder who loses control a
free hit to Air India free hit going over the sideline on the
hit in for Punjab Sindh bank 
Nearly twenty one minutes of play gone through Air India
 leading by a goal 
Score in the seventeenth minutes of first half by Aranha and
for the continuation of commentary in Hindi it is Abhay Chaturvedi 
 In India 
Abhay I would just like to say one thing five of the 
interrupt land 
For the Air India team now Darryl D'Souza and 
Edgar Mascarenhas they are infact trained as defendant 
But these are the two players who besides being playing as
defendants they are always leading the attack 
And they are always keeping them forward on the move whereas
 there in the Punjab Sindh bank team the size of these a few
words is very long 
Ah Ramsharan Gundeep Ripudaman 
They have not been able to combine well whereas the Air India
forward they're just lurking near the goal mark 
They just get hardly chance at the two words 
They would have been thrown up but for Aranha that you cast in
last line who catches the one with one day and centrally
 one word feeling I don't know whether you agree with me or not
Punjab Sindh bank having nearly five internationals is
kill their act
But I think over confident must have started with that 
And this is what you are paying for your over confidence 
And so far they have not been able to combine well and all the
players played so far ah practically you a few words 
Before we leave on to catch the relay a few words 
I was considering they got just four chances 
And out of the four chances they converted three 
Fourth one was Edward Aranha a ball going just by yard 
otherwise the goal keeper was awake there was no one to 
To me it appears the Punjab Sind bank defence does not know
what it was to be 
They are running everywhere but not marking defence 
Who lies the whole side Aranha here follows Rajesh
Chouhan and Darryl D'Souza Alex D'Souza all coming
into the attack nobody is marking 
They come into the attack and immediately don't go back 
That only shows their partners their thinking which the
Punjab Sindh bank boys two words 
The two words 
And they are more uh selfish 
If Ramsharan gets the ball he goes down the left flank he
doesn't look for a opening they are along with him 
Same is the case with uh uh Gundeep they have got a
very good chance and Gundeep has given a back pass to Ramsharan 
A swing way down the near the right back line 
And from here specially 
Once they go after the back line they are tied because they
can't do it 
Now here is the Punjab players back on the crease
 
The leading team has to prove a few words playing
final of the third Lala Bhim Sain memorial invitation hockey tournament
 at Shivaji stadium 
Venue of many international tournament 
The Punjab Sindh bank boys just relaxing but no
strategy is being formed 
Again on your same replaying Delhi policeman In
Hindi 
Punjab Sindh bank going into the field 
Now the second half will start 
Abhay the three goal lead in the final 
 It's a very great moral boosting 
In fact Punjab Sindh bank was expected to do very
well 
Played very well 
For them it is demoralising 
In second half we'll have to see whether they would be
able to recapture their form and fight back 
Yes they have thirty-five minutes or so 
Because one can't imagine that the Punjab Sindh bank
won't come back into the game 
They have the capacity they have the capability but the
only thing is they will have to stretch during individual approach 
and combined and move ahead with a combined move 
Here are they Air India team on the screen and number
eight 
Where 
This Rajinder Amar on the right side of the screen
 with yellow shirts is the Punjab Sindh bank team and right in the
middle with the red shirts on the right is T S Bullard the
international umpire and on his right is Kukoo Walia another
international umpire 
Now there goes the scene form rest of the day I shall
 suppose the former Lieutenant Governor of Delhi 
The Punjab Sindh bank team being introduced to him 
This is Narender former international umpire 
Sorry here is Bullard the international umpire Kukoo
Walia 
And now the Air India team 
Edgar Mascarenhas now introducing his boys to the
former Lieutenant Governor H K L Kapoor to his team mates from Air
India 
The four teams presented with the souvenir of this tournament
All there is over the two teams take their
respective places 
Punjab Sindh bank will attack from right to left 
Now already down by three goals 
They will have to work very hard to get back into the game
And the morals of the Air India boys is very high 
And one thing very notable that the Air India defences they
are marking their players very well 
They are not letting the rafter Gundeep and uh Ripudaman 
Ball on to the side and they know the passing would be
given to one of them and they are marking it very well 
All the attempt of Punjab Sindh bank to pass on the ball
 to either Ramsharan Gundeep or Ripudaman are being frustrated by
the passmanship of the well marked passing by the defenders
 of Air India 
Air India to start on the second half 
Edward Aranha with the ball the one who scored the first two
goals in the seventeen and twenty-third minutes the third goal coming of
that stick of Rajesh Chauhan in the thirty-third the first half
itself 
Back pass Chauhan to Harpreet on to the right for
Clive D'Souza 
 That's superb 
Good take work 
To Darryl Darryl gives it to Mascarenhas Edgar now from
there to Rajesh Chauhan good shot but it fine play by goalkeeper
Teja 
Corner hit by him
Mascarenhas free hit Air India 
Between the a few words 
Aimless forward pass over the backline 
Ripudaman Rajinder quick pass to Gundeep Pasha side
by umpire Kukoo Walia 
Free hit for Air India 
First hit for the in the first second half itself by Punjab
Sindh bank that showed their determination now 
But lets see 
Rajinder Gundeep keeps at the ball free hit for Air
India ball with Darryl D'Souza Darryl D'Souza 
forward to Aranha Aranha to Alex D'Souza 
 D'Souza to Aranha
