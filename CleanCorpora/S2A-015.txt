Nearly twenty one minutes of play gone through  Air India
""
""
Score in the seventeenth minutes of first half by Aranha  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Edgar Mascarenhas 
""
But these are the two players who besides being  playing as
""
""
And they are always keeping them forward on the move  whereas
""
""
""
""
""
""
forward 
""
They just get hardly chance 
""
They would have been thrown up but for Aranha  that you cast in
""
 I don't know whether you agree with me or not
""
""
""
kill their act
""
But I think over confident must have started with that 
""
""
""
And so far they have not been able to combine well and all the
players played so far 
""
Before we leave on 
""
I was considering they got just four chances 
""
""
""
Fourth one was Edward Aranha 
""
""
""
what 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They come into the attack and immediately don't go back 
""
That only shows their partners their thinking  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
doesn't look for a opening they are along with him 
""
""
very good chance

Edgar Mascarenhas  the

All there is over  take their

Punjab Sindh bank will attack from right to left

Now already down by three goals 
""
""

And one thing very notable that the Air India defences  they
are marking their players

All the attempt of  to pass on the ball
