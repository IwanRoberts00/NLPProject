""
""
 to de-alianate the fields to find out what
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
after very long years  some oil fields and gas fields have been identified
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to the public  in the
""
""
efforts  why not the government reconsider
""
precious oil resources  and confine only to the new fields which are yet
""
""
I would like to have a categorical answer  from the honourable
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

 which we had
discovered  ten to twelve years ago

So for years they were lying  oil was in place but

India is not the only country which is doing it
""
""
Russia in China

""
""
""
""
""
""
challenge from within the country

We have to have domestic company  we have to have international
companies

This the discovered oil fields is very limited its only five
