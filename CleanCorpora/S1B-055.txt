""
""
""
 ( a) When the
government have signed any contracts with the private companies  for
development of small oil and gas fields 
""
( b) If so the details there of 
""
( c) Whether the process of privatisation of hydro-carbon sector
has been considered 
""
( d) If so the contracts being initiated at present  and
""
( e)  The total contracts signed between the government and
private sector 
""
""
First  ( a) to ( e) the statement is laid on the table of
the house sir 
""
""
Speaker sir  know from the honourable
minister  open all those areas
which are exposition for not early  open to the security
reasons 
""
If so  how many such are likely to be opened at the earliest
area  ?
""
And another thing I would like to know  the wealth which have
been not properly 
new systems  in order to
increase the requirements of the crude 
""
The honourable minister has made a statement saying within three
years 
""
""
And I would like to know how you will able to achieve that results
 able to give some information I would be
happy 
""
""
The security  for opening up uh
 areas
""
Before that  uh clearance
required
""
And normally after we get the security clearance those areas are
opened up 
""
Specially where  foreign
companies involved 
""
Uh the second part of the question uh  uh on what steps are
being taken 
""
Sir there are various steps which are being undertaken  right
from  what you
call the E O R uh  uh proposal which is being
evaluated
""
There are five companies  uh bid for this proposal
 that
is being considered  because there will be substantial improvement from
the existing 
""
Besides that also of other fields  uh
geo-techniques and other 
""
Like the horizontal drilling in all other method  to see how we
can augment the all production 
""
And as far as the third third part of the question  is concerned
the sixty percent production rise 
""
Yes sir they are very much in place 
""
This year the production is going up by five million tonnes 
that means from the lower of twenty-seven millions last year 
""
This year the production goes upto thirty-two  next year
thirty-eight  I am glad to inform the
house  the oil production in the country will go upto forty-four point
five sir 
""
""
""
""
Speaker sir  what the
honourable minister says it should go upto forty-four point four five million
""
""
But whether they are going to do all the things within our own
country or in the boundaries of surrounding countries also  where it is
possible  ?
""
Whether the O N G  in Andra
Pradesh Tamil Nadu  for new areas for new
development  ?
""
Whether they are able to make in order 
 requirements are going up
""
By two thousand years  what is the total demand ?
""
How much we have to import ?
""
How much you can produce within the country  ?
""
And other important item is  technicians which
is required in this country are terribly shortage  and we are depending
more from outside 
""
Whether we will have a training school that we can develop them
within the country  ?
""
""
Sir the  strategy for oil explosion explosion in
production  India its share in the global oil
""
That means India must have 
""
Hence  oil within the country and outside
the country 
""
We are going to be exploring and getting  trying to explore
opportunities for producing oil outside 
""
Vietnam is the classical example  videsh
""
""
And I am glad to inform the honourable members  that in Vietnam
we have found gas  natural gas
""
The commercial study is right now under way 
""
Similarly 
""
We are negotiating with Yemen 
""
And there are various other places we are seeing  besides
looking for oil and gas within the country 
""
So that we don't miss the bus 
""
All this company this is a global phenomenon 
""
You look at all the majors 
British gas all the major 
""
They are not only looking in their territory they are also looking
globally 
""
So the idea is  self-sufficient in oil and
gas in the quickest quickest possible time frame and that is  the strategy
we are following 
""
""
Regarding the survey  in Andra Pradesh other areas has not
made any reply sir
""
""
Thank you very much 
""
""
V K Bhat 
""
""
A new  struck a new biggest field
in Terambulam village  in the Ramnagaram district of south southern Tamil
Nadu 
""
If so  to drill more
wells so that the gas field could be consolidated sir
""
""
Sir  I would like to convey to the honourable members in
the house  presence of hydrocarbon
 the logical next step is
 to de-alianate the fields to find out what
is the  and oil which is there
""
So that process 
automatically that project is taken up more wells are drilled
""
Only then we come to a conclusion  as to what is the size of the
reservoir what is the size of the  reserves we have
""
So that will be worked again 
""
""
Sir is this a fact that Terambulam  has been has been cut
short
""
""
Mr Rao please 
""
""
Mr Speaker sir  involving the
foreign  is unavoidable to some
extent  in view of
the fact that O N G C have invested and spend  crores
""
after very long years  some oil fields and gas fields have been identified
""
""
My question to the honourable minister is  why not the
government of India  to allocate new fields which are not
yet explored to the foreign companies  and take up oil exploration and
drilling operations by O N G C and our Indian oil companies ?
""
Various companies are there  giving issuing shares
to the public  in the
ratio of one is to four  definitely the O N G C and other oil companies
 will be in a position to explore the oil which has been formed with our
efforts  why not the government reconsider
its special policy offer giving on platter to this M L  the
precious oil resources  and confine only to the new fields which are yet
unexplored
""
I would like to have a categorical answer  from the honourable
minister 
""
""
Sir I think the honourable member is referring to the
discovered oil fields  Indian and
international companies 
""
Sir 
that when this decision was taken which was in ninety-two  our foreign
exchange reserves our foreign exchange  the resource crunch was so severe
 which we had
discovered  ten to twelve years ago
""
So for years they were lying  oil was in place but
they were not being exploited because of the resource crunch  on one hand
and the other that O N G C  was fully committed with whatever funds and
 it had
""
For other 
""
So to bring the oil on stream  in the earliest possible time
frame because of the severe 
 the country was facing
""
To save  we decided
to give some of these fields 
one word  ( b) that we
get the right technology that the production costs are  lower than even
what  O N G C uh would have spent
""
So after taking all these factors into consideration  we
negotiated in the best interest of O N G C and country sir 
""
""
But we have to purchase at international market prices 
""
""
It still comes to  uh to give
an idea  where the O N G C is a
partner  the kind of
investments which were required then  or even now when they start
operating the fields  is over a billion dollars and what are we giving
them 
""
We are giving them in a range of only ten percent to eighteen
percent that they return
""
The rest  than
 the other cases is all coming back to the company in the country
""
So it is in the best interest sir
""
India is not the only country which is doing it
""
This is being done as a regular programme in Argentina  in
Russia in China 
""
 a part of the thing to attract these companies who
will get into this crude oil fields and then  going to as you are saying
the future exploration project and it has already happened 
""
Some of these companies like Enron  and
Indian companies like Videocon or uh  they have moved
now from the discovered all these programmes and they are investing into
exploration which is the key area  reserve exploration is the biggest
challenge from within the country
""
We have to have domestic company  we have to have international
companies 
""
This the discovered oil fields is very limited its only five
percent of the total reserve 
""
What is more important is to get this investment into extension
area so that we can find new oil for the country
""
Another Bombay High 
the biggest challenge for the country  and this will bring bring about
this
""
""
Mr Shahabuddin 
""
""
Mr Speaker sir 
has referred to fourteen fields 
""
Now if  international rounds
of bids 
different 
""
Now I would like to know from the honourable minister  the
reason for the delay  in respect of the large
number of blocks that we had offered  ?
""
And for this the minister has not 
""
And secondly I would like to know  he has said that the first
five fields 
""
But about the other eight more small fields  he has not
mentioned 
""
So I would like to know whether that is also  in the nature of
production sharing agreement or not merely a service contract 
""
So first is the un  fields that we have offered to which
we have received no response and the reason therefore 
""
And  then these fields that have been now put under contract are
going to come on a stream 
""
""
Sir  the honourable member referred to the fifth fifth
round and the sixth round  continuous round of
bidding for explanation 
""
The subject matter which is being discussed right now does not
relate to explanation 
""
As far as the other the second part of the question  which
refers to the small fields and the type of contract 
""
For the small fields  unlike the discovered oil fields where I
said that the discovered oil oil fields five fields the investment is over a
billion dollars 
""
Here the small fields are so small  that they are actually not
economically viable for a company like O N G C and  to
handle 
Government Company Public Sector Company  and some other companies which
have got to gather on their own 
""
In these small fields 
here there is no joint sharing
""
These are very small  uh by those
companies  uh
crude wherever it is in the small small 
""
See 
size fields which are mention  which are joint ventures where O N G C and
the
