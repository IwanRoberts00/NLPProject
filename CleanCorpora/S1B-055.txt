Question number one twenty-one ( c) M V V S Murthy 
 Shri Murthy please 
 Shri Bolabuli Ramaiah ( a) When the
government have signed any contracts with the private companies for
development of small oil and gas fields 
( b) If so the details there of 
( c) Whether the process of privatisation of hydro-carbon sector
has been considered 
( d) If so the contracts being initiated at present and
( e) The total contracts signed between the government and
private sector 
First ( a) to ( e) the statement is laid on the table of
the house sir 
Speaker sir I would like to know from the honourable
minister when the government is supposed to open all those areas
which are exposition for not early one word open to the security
reasons 
If so how many such are likely to be opened at the earliest
area ?
And another thing I would like to know the wealth which have
been not properly or defeated whether they are able to plan any 
new systems that will enable to increase the fertility in order to
increase the requirements of the crude in this country 
The honourable minister has made a statement saying within three
years they have increased to upto sixty percent of the last 
 pre previous production 
And I would like to know how you will able to achieve that results
 and if you can be able to give some information I would be
happy 
The security clearance is required for opening up uh
 the areas
Before that uh we have to get the security uh clearance
required
And normally after we get the security clearance those areas are
opened up for either explanation or production 
Specially where they are outside investors foreign
companies involved 
Uh the second part of the question uh uh on what steps are
being taken to enhance the production 
Sir there are various steps which are being undertaken right
from Bombay High which is the largest field there is a what you
call the E O R uh enhance oil recovery uh proposal which is being
evaluated
There are five companies who have uh bid for this proposal
 which will improve our production from the Bombay High that
is being considered because there will be substantial improvement from
the existing 
Besides that also of other fields we are looking at uh
geo-techniques and other technology to come in 
Like the horizontal drilling in all other method to see how we
can augment the all production 
And as far as the third third part of the question is concerned
the sixty percent production rise 
Yes sir they are very much in place 
This year the production is going up by five million tonnes 
that means from the lower of twenty-seven millions last year 
This year the production goes upto thirty-two next year
thirty-eight and in the year ninety-seven I am glad to inform the
house the oil production in the country will go upto forty-four point
five sir 
 That's what the situation is 
Speaker sir as per the Eighth plan what the
honourable minister says it should go upto forty-four point four five million
 and if we achieve those it will be happy 
But whether they are going to do all the things within our own
country or in the boundaries of surrounding countries also where it is
possible ?
Whether the O N G C's make any new survey in Andra
Pradesh Tamil Nadu Kerala and Gujarat for new areas for new
development ?
Whether they are able to make in order to as 
 requirements are going up
By two thousand years what is the total demand ?
How much we have to import ?
How much you can produce within the country ?
And other important item is the driving technicians which
is required in this country are terribly shortage and we are depending
more from outside 
Whether we will have a training school that we can develop them
within the country I would like to know from the honourable minister ?
Sir the strategy for oil explosion explosion in
production is to get India its share in the global oil
That means India must have its equity in the global oil 
Hence we are looking for oil within the country and outside
the country 
We are going to be exploring and getting trying to explore
opportunities for producing oil outside 
Vietnam is the classical example where O N G C videsh
 started looking for oil in the Vietnam borders 
And I am glad to inform the honourable members that in Vietnam
we have found gas natural gas
The commercial study is right now under way 
Similarly we have taken a block in Egypt 
We are negotiating with Yemen 
And there are various other places we are seeing besides
looking for oil and gas within the country 
So that we don't miss the bus 
All this company this is a global phenomenon 
You look at all the majors whether it is British petroleum 
British gas all the major one word in the world 
They are not only looking in their territory they are also looking
globally 
So the idea is India should be self-sufficient in oil and
gas in the quickest quickest possible time frame and that is the strategy
we are following 
Regarding the survey in Andra Pradesh other areas has not
made any reply sir
Thank you very much 
V K Bhat 
A new O N G C has found a struck a new biggest field
in Terambulam village in the Ramnagaram district of south southern Tamil
Nadu 
If so will the ministry beg the O N G C to drill more
wells so that the gas field could be consolidated sir
Sir I would like to convey to the honourable members in
the house that wherever and whenever we find presence of hydrocarbon
 whether it is in the form of gas or crude the logical next step is
 more wells are drilled to de-alianate the fields to find out what
is the quantity of the gas and oil which is there
So that process definitely wherever it happens it is 
automatically that project is taken up more wells are drilled
Only then we come to a conclusion as to what is the size of the
reservoir what is the size of the one word reserves we have
So that will be worked again a few words 
Sir is this a fact that Terambulam has been has been cut
short
Mr Rao please 
Mr Speaker sir though taking the involving the
foreign companies in the oil exploratiion is unavoidable to some
extent I would like to know from the honourable minister in view of
the fact that O N G C have invested and spend thousands of crores
 of rupees and after great great deal of efforts 
after very long years some oil fields and gas fields have been identified
My question to the honourable minister is why not the
government of India his ministry to allocate new fields which are not
yet explored to the foreign companies and take up oil exploration and
drilling operations by O N G C and our Indian oil companies ?
Various companies are there and by giving issuing shares
to the public and raising one word into the ratio in the
ratio of one is to four definitely the O N G C and other oil companies
 will be in a position to explore the oil which has been formed with our
efforts and kindly one word why not the government reconsider
its special policy offer giving on platter to this M L C's the
precious oil resources and confine only to the new fields which are yet
unexplored
I would like to have a categorical answer from the honourable
minister 
Sir I think the honourable member is referring to the
discovered oil fields which were found out to the Indian and
international companies in the past 
Sir I would like to convey to the honourable member 
that when this decision was taken which was in ninety-two our foreign
exchange reserves our foreign exchange the resource crunch was so severe
 that we had some of these fields which we had found which we had
discovered ten to twelve years ago
So for years they were lying dormant oil was in place but
they were not being exploited because of the resource crunch on one hand
and the other that O N G C was fully committed with whatever funds and
 one word it had
For other which they considered more important projects 
So to bring the oil on stream in the earliest possible time
frame because of the severe oil crunch with which 
 the country was facing
To save the foreign exchange on the import bill we decided
to give some of these fields after ensuring that ( a) O N G C is 
one word to the partner to the extent of forty percent ( b) that we
get the right technology that the production costs are lower than even
what O N G C uh would have spent
So after taking all these factors into consideration we
negotiated in the best interest of O N G C and country sir 
But we have to purchase at international market prices 
It still comes to uh commercially speaking uh to give
an idea a uh that for a given field where the O N G C is a
partner like the Panno Mukhta Tapti Rava the kind of
investments which were required then or even now when they start
operating the fields is over a billion dollars and what are we giving
them 
We are giving them in a range of only ten percent to eighteen
percent that they return
The rest ninety percent in some cases a little less than
 the other cases is all coming back to the company in the country
So it is in the best interest sir
India is not the only country which is doing it
This is being done as a regular programme in Argentina in
Russia in China all over 
 It's a part of the thing to attract these companies who
will get into this crude oil fields and then going to as you are saying
the future exploration project and it has already happened 
Some of these companies like Enron and Kaman petroleum and
Indian companies like Videocon or uh uh the Reliance they have moved
now from the discovered all these programmes and they are investing into
exploration which is the key area reserve exploration is the biggest
challenge from within the country
We have to have domestic company we have to have international
companies 
This the discovered oil fields is very limited its only five
percent of the total reserve 
What is more important is to get this investment into extension
area so that we can find new oil for the country
Another Bombay High reserve efficience goes up that's 
the biggest challenge for the country and this will bring bring about
this
Mr Shahabuddin 
Mr Speaker sir in his reply the honourable minister 
has referred to fourteen fields 
Now if I recall sir in the seven international rounds
of bids that we had offered I believe that around fifty or sixty 
different blocks or fields are involved 
Now I would like to know from the honourable minister the
reason for the delay in response in respect of the large
number of blocks that we had offered ?
And for this the minister has not told anything 
And secondly I would like to know he has said that the first
five fields are going under a production sharing uh contract 
But about the other eight more small fields he has not
mentioned the type of contract 
So I would like to know whether that is also in the nature of
production sharing agreement or not merely a service contract 
So first is the un the fields that we have offered to which
we have received no response and the reason therefore 
And then these fields that have been now put under contract are
going to come on a stream 
Sir the honourable member referred to the fifth fifth
round and the sixth round that was the continuous continuous round of
bidding for explanation 
The subject matter which is being discussed right now does not
relate to explanation is mainly focused on discovered oil fields 
As far as the other the second part of the question which
refers to the small fields and the type of contract we have got into 
For the small fields unlike the discovered oil fields where I
said that the discovered oil oil fields five fields the investment is over a
billion dollars 
Here the small fields are so small that they are actually not
economically viable for a company like O N G C and one word to
handle that's why they were bound out and we have Gujarat uh uh 
Government Company Public Sector Company and some other companies which
have got to gather on their own 
In these small fields unlike the medium size fields 
here there is no joint sharing
These are very small uh the risk will be taken uh by those
companies who will be producing the small amounts of gas and uh uh
crude wherever it is in the small small one word 
See it's not a joint venture unlike the medium 
size fields which are mention which are joint ventures where O N G C and
the other companies are partners
