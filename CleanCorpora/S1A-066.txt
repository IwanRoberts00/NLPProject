<I>
""
""
Good morning sir 
""
I am Mukta Mahajan 
""
And uh  we are the
natives of that city 
""
My 
""
I have three sisters 
""
Ours is the family of teachers 
""
And 
""
My father  position of a
teacher  who guides the
complete generation 
""
And  this particular
profession 
""
""
 nice to meet a person who belongs to an academic
""
""
""
""
""
""
And what brings you here all the way from Jalgaon to Kolhapur
""
""
""
I have come to attend the refresher course in English 
""
""
Have you 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Is it your first  second
""
""
It is the first refresher course 
""
And I am feeling very nice  that I am in the company of so
brilliant brains  and particulary the people I find here they are really
""
""
""
""
""
And 
""
Do you think that they have colleges wherever  to what you teach
in the classes 
""
""
I think
""
""
One difficulty is or one  uhm shall I suggest these
courses is that  very
little to do with  do
you agree with this charge 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes I do agree with this charge because  the classroom
situation is completely different  about
 ideal conditions
""
""
Yes
""
""
If we cannot really apply reality  and while teaching a
particular text or a particular portion we have to face lot of problems apart
from the 
""
""
Yet you agree that ideals are good enough 
""
""
Of course we need them  of course we
need them 
""
""
""
""
""
We may say that ideals  will cease to be ideals if they
are attainable 
""
""
Yes it is really sir  it is really true
""
But unless we have ideals then we will go astray 
""
""
They do show us a direction 
""
""
Sir 
""
""
And give us 
don't they 
""
""
We may go wrong but we we have that particular say a kind of
lighthouse  and we have to travel in that direction
""
""
""
""
""
So it  light you may say
""
""
Sir  yes sir
""
""
That guides you on your career
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
And how about this Kolhapur 
""
""
""
""
For the first time I am enjoying the rain and cold and really
thrilling one 
""
And the beauty of nature and the greenery  really
fantastic 
""
""
You don't have this in Jalgaon
""
""
No no no  so hot
 to stay in Jalgaon during
the month of  uh April and May particularly
""
""
And perhaps you find it difficult to be here  from your
 I believe
""
""
""
""
""
I I am feeling completely migrated bird 
""
""
Do you 
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
But how is the migration  or good to
bad
""
""
Well 
""
""
Bad to good
""
""
Because man needs water 
 man will flourish
""
""
""
Nice 
""
""
It 
""
""
""
""
""
And what about the historicity of this place 
""
Have you visited any historical place
""
""
Uhn ufortunately I could not sir 
""
Unfortunately I could not because uh rain is so heavy that I dare
not to go outside 
""
""
Lack of opportunity not interest 
""
""
No I I really interest  I have really interest in seeing
the sight which are you 
but due to lack of 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes sir 
on Sunday 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes sir I know it 
""
""
You must be knowing this all history don't you
""
""
No sir 
""
""
You don't know the importance of  Panhalgad
""
""
You don't mean that you don't know it 
""
""
Pardon sir 
""
""
You don't mean that you don't know  Panhalgad
""
""
""
""
""
Yes I have read a lot about  and I have also asked my friends
that we will  we will go there but they said that due to rain it will be
impossible to go there 
""
And none of them is ready 
""
""
That is one of the forts you know  that immortalise that
great partriot  Deshpande
 of Siddhi
Johar at 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I have gone through the history
""
""
I had been there 
""
We had a taxi 
""
It was a nice experience going there
""
And unlike other forts  not tiring business for
 of environment
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You can take your taxi on the top 
""
We can visit the places in the  and
""
""
And there is another place also nearby 
""
""
""
""
""
Which one 
""
""
It is one 
""
""
I like that main building particularly  that statue of
Shivaji Maharaj  it seems going to
sky  uhm to mean place to some where highest
place and  I really like that statue
""
""
""
""
""
Great men do have an elevating effect you know 
""
""
Sir
""
""
When you look them from the bottom to the top you feel going
higher and higher
""
""
Higher and higher 
""
I really like that statue and I  whenever I get a chance I go
there and have a round and enjoy that greenery and structure 
""
""
""
 that means it must be quite an
effort for a frail person like you  to do all these
things
""
""
It means both things I try to achieve 
a kind of exercise for me 
""
And because I need it and I never get a chance in my city to go
out  so crowded and particulary there are
no places 
""
When I come here in this  it's
 really lovely place
""
""
You are coming for the first time 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
You have never been this side 
""
""
No 
""
""
How did you come 
""
""
By train 
""
""
By train
""
""
By train 
""
""
You must be finding the journey very  tiresome
""
""
Very tiresome  a long journey
""
""
Especially after Poona 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
If the train becomes passenger  and uh unbearable journey it
becomes 
""
Uhn  to come to Kolhapur
""
""
When are you leaving 
""
""
On twenty first 
""
""
On twenty first 
""
""
The course is  we finished
on the nineteenth
""
""
But I have got the reservation of twenty first 
""
""
So you are overstaying a little
""
""
Yes sir  for one day
""
""
Thanks to  laughter
""
""
""
So that I will be able to visit the places I couldn't
""
""
Ah you will have go shopping
""
""
 a day gap
""
""
""
""
""
Shopping 
""
""
No I am not interested in shopping whenever I go to market I
buy books only that is all 
""
""
So you are a bibliophile 
""
So I would better ask you to go to the 
have you been there
""
""
Yes  been there
""
""
How you find the temple 
""
""
 you say
 the faith in man
grows when we go in the company of  I I didn't I
couldn't go inside the temple  because I was in hurry but I have decided
to go there  on Sunday
""
""
Do go inside 
""
""
Of course sir 
""
""
Because the  is very
beautiful in name of the goddess
""
""
Outside  it
becomes necessary to go inside and  experience it
""
""
""
""
""
Unless you enter a temple  it is no
visit to a temple you know
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
 not a place of tourists interest
""
""
But I have heard that fold your hands and your  uh prayers
reach to god 
""
""
They do  if you have faith
""
""
""
""
There is no need of going to temple 
and close your eyes and your prayer will go to god
""
""
They do 
""
""
And it will come true 
""
And many times I had experienced it that I couldn't get a chance
to go to temple 
""
One of my wish has come true that is uh  acheiving this
doctorate 
""
""
Yes you have achieved a doctorate 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
What did you 
""
""
American literature 
""
I am interested in American literature and uh  I have taken
the subject uh  A study of prose style of Ernest
Hemingway with special reference to his novels 
""
""
Hemingway 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
But who was your guide by the way 
""
""
Uh presently he is the vice-Chancellor of Indore University
""
""
""
We have heard 
""
""
Of course 
""
""
Yes you were fortunate enough to get hold of him
""
""
Of course of course 
""
It was a nice experience for me  to live in his company and to
share his 
""
""
Did you publish your 
""
""
Not yet sir 
""
I have lost a lot of money and it has become a white elephant for
me now a days 
""
""
But do publish it 
""
""
Of course sir I will 
""
""
Because  it is very necessary for people to know
""
""
Uhm  baby
because it is  and everybody likes
to see growing up and spreading 
""
""
""
""
""
And as the proverb go  like
the mother like the baby 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
So it must be  excuse
""
""
Ah ha ha 
""
""
I am really glad to know  at a
young age 
""
""
It did with all the blessings of my parents
""
They really  allowed me to do
otherwise girls are not allowed in our caste  at such extent
and 
""
They created such a atmosphere in home that I  I was not
allowed to do any household work  male person
""
""
""
 very progressive you know
""
""
Yes 
""
""
In those days especially  daughters
are looked down upon  burden
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 fortunate
enough in the sense 
""
""
 I am living in the blessed
company of my parents I really love my parents and I am proud of them 
""
""
That is very nice 
""
And how many brothers and sisters are you 
""
""
Uh we are three sisters and  I have one brother he has uh
completed his civil enigneering course  and presently he
is working as project engineer  in an International company
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
At Jalgaon 
outside  in any state
""
""
Touring job 
""
""
Yes yes touring job 
""
Presently he is in Poona 
""
""
Is he 
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
So you must have been to Poona to see him
""
""
No 
""
""
Didn't feel like going 
""
""
 I was feeling so homesick in the first week of
course
""
""
That  like going
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  no no
""
""
But couldn't make it
""
""
I I I  I asked my parents and my brother not even to ring
me 
""
So that I will remind them again and I will try to cry 
""
""
So you just wanted to forget everything else and merge 
""
""
""
""
and wanted to be alone here  so that I will be able to mix up with these
people
""
But I
""
""
How come you are so home sick 
""
""
Rather I am  more emotional
""
""
How did you manage your Ph D work 
""
You must have been going there somewhere
""
""
Yes yes 
""
Somebody used to come with me if if I had to stay there for two
days three days either  papa or my brother or my friend used to come with
me 
""
""
So you generally don't move without an escort
""
""
Ah ha of course of course 
""
""
Feminist will file a complaint against you 
""
""
Let them complain 
""
""
That  a feminist
""
""
""
""
No I I never 
""
And I want to to be 
people in our country
""
""
All the best
""
But don't you feel that it is time 
and that
""
""
""
""
""
So this is the first attempt
""
""
Yes it is  and I am
successful making it 
""
""
""
""
""
And living away from your 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now they are uhm uhm  I got two or three calls from them and
they are also waiting for me 
""
They are eagerly waiting for me  they are asking me to come
again and again 
""
""
So they are rather watering your homesickness  I
should say rather 
""
""
""
""
""
How do you find this food in uh Kolhapur 
""
""
Uhm not much better sir  I am so found of eating curries
and  but I couldn't get it here
""
Of course I I have to go out  and get
there
