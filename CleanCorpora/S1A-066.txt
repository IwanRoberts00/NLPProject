<I>
Good morning sir 
I am Mukta Mahajan I have come from Jalgaon 
And uh my city is developing city and we are the
natives of that city 
My father is retired lecturer 
I have three sisters and one brother 
Ours is the family of teachers 
And I have got the inspiration particularly from my father 
My father always tells me that the position of a
teacher is of a person who guides the society who guides the
complete generation 
And that's why I have selected this particular
profession 
 It's nice to meet a person who belongs to an academic
 family I should say 
 It's really true sir 
And what brings you here all the way from Jalgaon to Kolhapur
I have come to attend the refresher course in English 
Have you 
Yes sir 
Is it your first or second
It is the first refresher course I am attending 
And I am feeling very nice that I am in the company of so
brilliant brains and particulary the people I find here they are really
 sunshine brain and moonshine heart 
 Wah very nice 
And how do you find the courses 
Do you think that they have colleges wherever to what you teach
in the classes 
I think
One difficulty is or one uhm shall I suggest these
courses is that they are only of an academic nature very
little to do with grammarian work in the classes ahn do
you agree with this charge 
 Ahn 
Yes I do agree with this charge because the classroom
situation is completely different and we are uh told here about
 ideal conditions
Yes
If we cannot really apply reality and while teaching a
particular text or a particular portion we have to face lot of problems apart
from the teaching itself 
Yet you agree that ideals are good enough 
Of course we need them to follow of course we
need them 
 To follow 
We may say that ideals will cease to be ideals if they
are attainable won't they 
Yes it is really sir it is really true
But unless we have ideals then we will go astray 
They do show us a direction 
Sir 
And give us where we have to go and where we stand 
don't they 
We may go wrong but we we have that particular say a kind of
lighthouse yeah and we have to travel in that direction
 Yeah 
So it it's a one word light you may say
Sir yes sir
That guides you on your career
Yes sir 
And how about this Kolhapur 
 It's very fantastic city 
For the first time I am enjoying the rain and cold and really
thrilling one 
And the beauty of nature and the greenery it's really
fantastic 
You don't have this in Jalgaon
No no no it's completely hot and so so hot
 that it becomes impossible for outsiders to stay in Jalgaon during
the month of uh April and May particularly
And perhaps you find it difficult to be here from your
 a few words I believe
 Yes sir 
I I am feeling completely migrated bird you know 
Do you 
Yes sir
But how is the migration from bad to worse or good to
bad
Well from bad to good 
Bad to good
Because man needs water to his to his 
 roots so that uh as bud will come out and man will flourish
 and here I am really feeling that sense of flowering 
Nice you are paying a very rich tribute to Kolhapur 
It it deserves sir 
 And 
And what about the historicity of this place 
Have you visited any historical place
Uhn ufortunately I could not sir 
Unfortunately I could not because uh rain is so heavy that I dare
not to go outside 
Lack of opportunity not interest 
No I I really interest I have really interest in seeing
the sight which are you know well known for historical importance 
but due to lack of opportunity 
 Because of the vacation 
Yes sir but I am I am deciding to visit the places 
on Sunday some place 
 There are different forts here you kown 
 Panhalgad 
Yes sir I know it 
You must be knowing this all history don't you
No sir 
You don't know the importance of Panhalgad
You don't mean that you don't know it 
Pardon sir 
You don't mean that you don't know Panhalgad
 and it's importance in Maratha history 
 I I I have read 
Yes I have read a lot about and I have also asked my friends
that we will we will go there but they said that due to rain it will be
impossible to go there 
And none of them is ready 
That is one of the forts you know that immortalise that
great partriot of course Baji Prabhu Deshpande
 who helped Shivaji to escape from there from the seige of Siddhi
Johar at one word 
 Of course 
 Of course 
I have gone through the history
I had been there 
We had a taxi 
It was a nice experience going there
And unlike other forts it's not tiring business for
 haan of environment
 Haan 
Yeah 
You can take your taxi on the top 
We can visit the places in the conveyer uhn and
 it's very less tiring job 
And there is another place also nearby 
 Uhn 
Which one 
It is one uh two words 
I like that main building particularly that statue of
Shivaji Maharaj one word still it seems going to
sky from the earth going from uhm to mean place to some where highest
place and I really like that statue
 One word that 
Great men do have an elevating effect you know 
Sir
When you look them from the bottom to the top you feel going
higher and higher
Higher and higher 
I really like that statue and I whenever I get a chance I go
there and have a round and enjoy that greenery and structure and the 
 atmosphere 
 That means that means it must be quite an
effort for a frail person like you laughter to do all these
things
It means both things I try to achieve just it's 
a kind of exercise for me 
And because I need it and I never get a chance in my city to go
out and uh because it's so crowded and particulary there are
no places in our city 
When I come here in this uh area of University it's
 really lovely place
You are coming for the first time 
Yes sir 
You have never been this side 
No 
How did you come 
By train 
By train
By train 
You must be finding the journey very tiresome
Very tiresome it's a long journey
Especially after Poona 
Yes sir 
If the train becomes passenger and uh unbearable journey it
becomes but I have no other way 
Uhn which is convenient way to come to Kolhapur
When are you leaving 
On twenty first 
On twenty first 
The course is I think one word we finished
on the nineteenth
But I have got the reservation of twenty first 
So you are overstaying a little
Yes sir for one day
Thanks to one word reservations laughter
So that I will be able to visit the places I couldn't
Ah you will have go shopping
 Right a day gap
 Uhm 
Shopping 
No I am not interested in shopping whenever I go to market I
buy books only that is all 
So you are a bibliophile laughter aren't you 
So I would better ask you to go to the Mahalaxmi temple 
have you been there
Yes I've been there
How you find the temple 
 It's very lovely here one gets the you say
 per perfect religious atmosphere and uh the faith in man
grows when we go in the company of that structure only I I didn't I
couldn't go inside the temple because I was in hurry but I have decided
to go there on Sunday
Do go inside 
Of course sir 
Because the one word and two words is very
beautiful in name of the goddess
Outside observation won't do always it
becomes necessary to go inside and experience it
 And there are lights also there 
Unless you enter a temple laughter it is no
visit to a temple you know
Yes sir 
 It's not a place of tourists interest
But I have heard that fold your hands and your uh prayers
reach to god 
They do if you have faith
 Laughs 
There is no need of going to temple just fold your hands 
and close your eyes and your prayer will go to god
They do 
And it will come true 
And many times I had experienced it that I couldn't get a chance
to go to temple and uh I just pray in heart and my wishes come true 
One of my wish has come true that is uh acheiving this
doctorate 
Yes you have achieved a doctorate 
Yes sir 
What did you make research 
American literature 
I am interested in American literature and uh I have taken
the subject uh in that uh uh A study of prose style of Ernest
Hemingway with special reference to his novels 
Hemingway 
Yes sir 
But who was your guide by the way 
Uh presently he is the vice-Chancellor of Indore University
 Dr S H Chandel 
We have heard one word 
Of course 
Yes you were fortunate enough to get hold of him
Of course of course 
It was a nice experience for me to live in his company and to
share his uh knowledge and to enlighten myself 
Did you publish your research 
Not yet sir 
I have lost a lot of money and it has become a white elephant for
me now a days and it will take a lot of time 
But do publish it 
Of course sir I will 
Because it is very necessary for people to know
Uhm everybodys research is uh his or her baby
because it is yes it is one creation and everybody likes
to see growing up and spreading 
 Yes 
And as the proverb go laughter like
the mother like the baby 
Ah ha laughs 
So it must be two words excuse
Ah ha ha 
I am really glad to know that you have done this at a
young age 
It did with all the blessings of my parents
They really made me uh they really allowed me to do
otherwise girls are not allowed in our caste to study at such extent
and but they allowed me 
They created such a atmosphere in home that I I was not
allowed to do any household work I was treated like a boy male person
 That's very progressive you know
Yes 
In those days especially when cough daughters
are looked down upon ah ha as the unwanted burden
 Ah ha 
 No no our parents gave equal treatment 
 and 
 You're you're fortunate
enough in the sense I mean I mean 
 Of course I am I am I am living in the blessed
company of my parents I really love my parents and I am proud of them 
That is very nice 
And how many brothers and sisters are you 
Uh we are three sisters and I have one brother he has uh
completed his civil enigneering course civil and presently he
is working as project engineer engineer in an International company
 one word one word 
 Civil 
 Where where 
At Jalgaon but he has to go uh to visit site 
outside in any state
Touring job 
Yes yes touring job 
Presently he is in Poona 
Is he 
Yes sir
So you must have been to Poona to see him
No 
Didn't feel like going there there 
 I I I I was feeling so homesick in the first week of
course
That you did feel like going
 That I 
Yes no no
But couldn't make it
I I I I asked my parents and my brother not even to ring
me 
So that I will remind them again and I will try to cry 
So you just wanted to forget everything else and merge 
 with all this things 
 Yes I I wanted to cut all the friends 
and wanted to be alone here so that I will be able to mix up with these
people
But I
How come you are so home sick 
Rather I am a bit emotional more emotional
How did you manage your Ph D work 
You must have been going there somewhere
Yes yes but somebody used to come with me 
Somebody used to come with me if if I had to stay there for two
days three days either papa or my brother or my friend used to come with
me 
So you generally don't move without an escort
Ah ha of course of course 
Feminist will file a complaint against you 
Let them complain 
That you are not a feminist
 What is I I am 
No I I never uhm say that I am a feminist 
And I want to to be a woman uh which is idealised by 
people in our country
All the best
But don't you feel that it is time you stood on your own 
and that
 I'm trying I'm trying 
So this is the first attempt
Yes it is the first attempt and I am
successful making it 
 You have made it 
And living away from your parents for about 
 twenty eight days 
 Living away 
 Yes now I have allowed them to ring me 
Now they are uhm uhm I got two or three calls from them and
they are also waiting for me 
They are eagerly waiting for me they are asking me to come
again and again 
So they are rather watering your homesickness I
should say rather since they laughter 
 Yes yes yes 
How do you find this food in uh Kolhapur 
Uhm not much better sir I am so found of eating curries
and chatpata khana but I couldn't get it here
Of course I I have to go out outside and town and get
