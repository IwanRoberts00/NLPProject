<I>
""
""
Uh I wonder this has been actually defined you know what what
gossip consist of  uh
uhm attitudes and emotions I mean  a very emotive kind of use of
languages this  gossip
""
""
""
""
""
 this is
 very
""
""
Highly coloured
""
""
Highly coloured
""
Now gossip I believe is like humour  which is peculiar to every
language
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And every culture  you see and there is
something which is  which you can't pass on
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
I mean just as you cannot  see poetry is something basic
 so has humour
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And I think more than poetry and humour is gossip
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Because it is there letting yourself go 
letting yourself go is letting your  say orientation of thinking and
feeling  really have a free place
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And that kind of thing you see I 
they see that is some of us  in
which you see  this is not that it will be that oriented
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Some of us would be playing to the oriented and  say other
languages  isn't it
""
this possible 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which have that value 
""
Uh for instance words like 
you know 
""
""
You see this is I think
""
""
 or some such things
""
""
Pushpinder this is letting yourself go
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Now whether you can let yourself go  in a
language which is not the language of your
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
I mean  say orientation of
your  thinking and feeling structures
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You see this is 
and mostly gossip is just than talking about nothing
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And yet you see you find people  extremely at home which is
there
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And extremely interesting
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
I mean if you if 
some kind of a dramatic content 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Anyway it accounts to nothing
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And yet you see  you
 I
think they  two
words  you see
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Perhaps it has a psychological uh  dimension as well as a
social one
""
And we are talking about  social
cultural  a
 which is
 uh but I think there is a
psychological dimension as well
""
Just as in humour  that
you know  in
 it's
""
""
So even in gossip there are these  these psychological factors
isn't it ?
""
Some kind of hatred or  uh maybe some feelings of angrer or
jealousy or whatever
""
You know  instead of uh you
because you don't have a way of expressing them openly  or just saying how
I hate so and so  I wish I could
kill him or some such thing 
""
You don't uh 
gossip about that person or you talk about that 
 going
out with so and so or 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 to say they are psychological
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Probably trying to make some kind of distinction between this
social and psychological
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And  don't think I
don't think 
""
""
 I
mean  these are two aspects
""
""
""
""
""
No no I don't think  I don't think
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I don't think they are two aspects 
""
I think they  relatonship is rather organic
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
It is psychological in fact if you try to understand it and
see it in terms of the genisis
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
You will find rooted in your collective unconscious
""
""
Uhm
""
""
You will find it rooted in your 
obviously your habits are really  coming to terms with it
""
""
""
""
""
Right
""
""
Coming to  and and expressing it
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
So so we  that distinction does not stand
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You see  in between the
collective social and  then psychological
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You see what in fact  I mean one could say
""
pshychological factor that you are talking about  I mean how
an individual absorbs  you see or response to whatever one
has inherited
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
This is not that collective  you see level
 I mean social
existence
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So it is  there would be
of course I am not trying to rule out the personal inclusion  personal
action  personal action will be there
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
But the personal action would be see you will have to see in
terms of uh  I mean talking
about 
 or
""
""
""
""
""
Now suppose you were to take 
""
""
Say a concrete instance of how we  gossip in the staff room for
example 
""
So I am going to take a 
Stardust film gossip  or some such things
""
""
True true I mean staff room  gossip is
more different from 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
See I I
""
""
So we can take any context 
kind of thing and this is uh  but now if we were trying to
 when we gossip say in
the staff room or in in a party or something
""
""
Yeah  true
""
""
Uh what  social and psychological
dimensions 
are 
""
""
 I will tell I will tell I
will tell I will tell 
social and psychological dimesions are undermined  in even
whatever  say pass and start from gossips
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 what
we are trying to do is
""
""
Yeah
""
""
To either run away from certain things 
from certain tensions  from certain contridictions
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
From certain say  their phase or certain
""
""
Sure  yeah
""
""
Or  you see we are trying to have adjustments
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Or 
yeah 
communicate  comminicability
""
""
""
""
""
""
 Uh I
""
""
So 
 had I
mean this you you they are not talking in the air  not just
floating there
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
I mean  not just that I enter the staff room
when I am off my  say grounding
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
I I am there and then  obviously that kind of a
gossip has acquired a kind of a grammar of its own
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
It has acquired a  grade
 of its own
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And I only fear  whatever we talk about in
the staffroom 
uhm  of that grammar
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I mean  or a
certain you see habit of saying things 
""
There are certain  you see way of verbalising things
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Rather than you see what may have been gossiped about  if
we were not  one word
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Say of another language  ah
ha  specific kinds of effects
""
""
""
""
""
Oh so you think that you know that 
 uh in a way over it
""
""
""
""
""
We we being 
right  an English coffee
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And when I gossip  gossip in English staffroom
""
""
Ha
""
""
And the particular kind of  of
effects which we  think you see are respectable enough
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Or which are interesting enough  which you see
 say some air of
respectability
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I mean I do not know I mean this is it is directly you you
wouldn't like to  I mean just like I mean just would
like to something that is 
respectable
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You see  is
I fear
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Not merely  a bottleneck
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Only in respect of samething  expressing or communicating
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Probably this also influences  constitutive
 and familiar way what really is said
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Or what really is talked about
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
So therefore  I mean with the the I think the gossip takes
uh 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Overtakes us 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And  yeah
 through us
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I mean some kind of  isn't it ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
But you know  part of that running away that you said
in the beginning you know
""
That  desire to run away
""
""
Uh now English serves a very useful purpose  over there
 running away from our actual circumstances also
means running away from our language or from our real being and so on 
""
And so in the context of the staffroom  uh what happens is that
we run away from those 
""
""
""
""
""
 you
see we are not sure 
""
""
""
""
""
 a constructed
world  in that world as you say of course we are
very careful  some of
the  circulated norms you know
""
""
""
""
""
We we are playing the game
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And the games for I mean for which in fact we device the
rules
""
""
Uhm
""
""
But now the rules really get better of us
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So that we game is being played by the rules in fact
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And we are probably  we we probably become
instruments
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So
""
""
I find that happens quite a lot to me because  what
happens is uh sometimes I violate those rules  sometimes
I  in the context of staffroom
one is not supposed to be  talking seriously about it
""
""
That is right  that is that they
they that is the violation
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
That is
""
""
Now sometimes I put my foot in then I start talking seriously
""
not done there and
""
""
""
""
""
 not done and
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
And 
that's 
""
""
 if if
there were a referee 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
To see this match of uh  to
monitoring this match 
 declare it as foul
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  right
""
""
Uh uh  or
you are being serious you see  this is this a foul play
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
This is not admissable
""
""
""
""
""
That is exactly as my difficulty here is
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
That the  the gossip itself here
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Say 
is is 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And 
you see 
""
""
 yeah
""
""
Now which we  very acutely
aware of
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You see  start
playing the game
""
""
Yeah
""
""
The games get better off
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Then so do the rules
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And so we merely are then the puppets
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So we are just just his  voice
""
""
Yeah
