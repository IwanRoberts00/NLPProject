<I>
Uh I wonder this has been actually defined you know what what
gossip consist of because one of the things that it consists of is uh
uhm attitudes and emotions I mean it's a very emotive kind of use of
languages this precisely gossip
 Precisely 
 Precisely precisely this is
 this is very
Highly coloured
Highly coloured
Now gossip I believe is like humour which is peculiar to every
language
Uhm 
And every culture and every you see and there is
something which is which you can't pass on
Uhm 
I mean just as you cannot see poetry is something basic
 uhm the people and culture so has humour
 Uhm 
Uhm 
And I think more than poetry and humour is gossip
Uhm 
Because it is there letting yourself go and 
letting yourself go is letting your say orientation of thinking and
feeling yeah really have a free place
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah
And that kind of thing you see I wonder if 
they see that is some of us you've to do it in the language in
which you see this is not that it will be that oriented
 Yeah 
Yeah 
Some of us would be playing to the oriented and say other
languages that means other than our own and isn't it
 might be possible but I do not know how far is 
this possible 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Because there are certain words you know 
which have that value 
Uh for instance words like faltu and uh 
you know 
You see this is I think
 Patao or some such things
Pushpinder this is letting yourself go
Yeah 
Now whether you can let yourself go yeah in a
language which is not the language of your
 Yeah 
Yeah 
I mean basic upbringing or basic say orientation of
your yeah thinking and feeling structures
 Yeah 
Yeah 
You see this is yeah that is this an 
and mostly gossip is just than talking about nothing
 Yeah 
Yeah 
And yet you see you find people extremely at home which is
there
Yeah 
And extremely interesting
Yeah 
I mean if you if you would reduce it to a 
some kind of a dramatic content 
 Yeah 
Uhm 
Anyway it accounts to nothing
Uhm 
And yet you see when when you
 you see see people gossiping yeah I
think they they're completely I mean there is sort of two
words sense of feeling at home yeah you see
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Perhaps it has a psychological uh dimension as well as a
social one
And we are talking about you know one word social
cultural uh pattern there which are evident or it's a
 it's a form of social behaviour which is
 specific to any culture to uh but I think there is a
psychological dimension as well
Just as in humour there is a psychological dimension that
you know it's a play of the uh uhm subconscious or in
 in in grotesque in fantasy I mean it's
 it's subconscious coming out 
So even in gossip there are these these psychological factors
isn't it ?
Some kind of hatred or uh maybe some feelings of angrer or
jealousy or whatever
You know one word instead of uh you
because you don't have a way of expressing them openly or just saying how
I hate so and so or uh I I detest that person and uh I wish I could
kill him or some such thing 
You don't uh pu put it in that way but you 
gossip about that person or you talk about that person about 
 little things that the person does or doesn't do and so on going
out with so and so or having a 
 One word 
 But that's one word 
 No I wanted to say they are psychological
Yeah
Probably trying to make some kind of distinction between this
social and psychological
Yeah 
And I I I don't think I
don't think 
 Not yeah not the total distinction but I
mean these are two aspects
 No I 
No no I don't think they I don't think
 They 
Yeah
I don't think they are two aspects 
I think they two words relatonship is rather organic
Uhm uhm
It is psychological in fact if you try to understand it and
see it in terms of the genisis
Uhm 
You will find rooted in your collective unconscious
Uhm
You will find it rooted in your then 
obviously your habits are really coming to terms with it
 Right 
Right
Coming to and and expressing it
Yeah yeah
So so we two words that distinction does not stand
Yeah 
You see the the the in between the
collective social and yeah then psychological
 Yeah 
Yeah
You see what in fact you see one I mean one could say
 is that this is the say the the the 
pshychological factor that you are talking about would be I mean how
an individual absorbs uhm you see or response to whatever one
has inherited
 Uhm 
Uhm
This is not that collective uh you see level
 uhm that of ones uhm I mean social
existence
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm
So it is they they there would be
of course I am not trying to rule out the personal inclusion personal
action uhm personal action will be there
 Uhm 
Uhm
But the personal action would be see you will have to see in
terms of uh I mean the style of one's feeling I mean talking
about one word things or you see stressing certain things 
 yeah or
 Yeah 
Now suppose you were to take a the 
 con concrete instance you know 
Say a concrete instance of how we gossip in the staff room for
example 
So I am going to take a another instance like 
Stardust film gossip or some such things
True true I mean staff room yeah gossip is
more different from Stardust gossip 
 Yeah 
Yeah yeah
See I I
So we can take any context and that is the written uh 
kind of thing and this is uh uh spoken but now if we were trying to
 if we were to try and analyse uh what we do when we gossip say in
the staff room or in in a party or something
Yeah that's true
Uh what what what social and psychological
dimensions you you think are are 
are they 
 I I'll tell I will tell I will tell I
will tell I will tell I'll tell you 
social and psychological dimesions are undermined uhm in even
whatever we really say pass and start from gossips
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 But we are trying to one word what
we are trying to do is
Yeah
To either run away from certain things uhm 
from certain tensions uhm from certain contridictions
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Yeah
From certain say certain form their phase or certain
Sure yeah
Or you see we are trying to have adjustments
Yeah 
Or we are trying to really transform them 
yeah into some kind of socially respectable kind of 
communicate communication I mean comminicability
 Yeah 
 Yeah Uh I
So the the the I I 
 mean if we if we yeah had I
mean this you you they are not talking in the air one word not just
floating there
 Yeah 
Uhm 
I mean it's not just that I enter the staff room
when I am off my say phase and I am off my say grounding
Uhm 
I I am there and then ob obviously that kind of a
gossip has acquired a kind of a grammar of its own
Uhm 
It has acquired a gradient grade
 of its own
Uhm 
And I only fear that whatever we talk about in
the staffroom uhm it gets talked about more 
uhm under the one word of that grammar
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Yeah
I mean one word abiding by a certain idiom or a
certain you see habit of saying things 
There are certain you see way of verbalising things
Uhm 
Rather than you see what may have been gossiped about if
we were not I mean under this kind of one word of one word
Yeah 
Say of another language and striving for ah
ha specific kinds of effects
 Ah ha 
Oh so you think that you know that English comes in 
 English comes uh in a way over it
 English comes 
We we being one word comes in one word 
right this is this is this is an English coffee
 Laughs 
Yeah 
And when I gossip gossip in English staffroom
Ha
And the particular kind of say first one word of
effects which we uhm think you see are respectable enough
 Uhm 
Ah 
Or which are interesting enough uh which you see
 which one word have some air of say some air of
respectability
 Uh 
Uhm
I mean I do not know I mean this is it is directly you you
wouldn't like to just wait say I mean just like I mean just would
like to something that is uh vulgar or that is not 
respectable
 Yeah 
Yeah 
You see the now this scene of respectability is
I fear
Yeah
Not merely a say a bottleneck
Uhm
Only in respect of samething expressing or communicating
Uhm 
Probably this also influences in a very constitutive
 uhm and familiar way what really is said
 Uhm 
Uhm
Or what really is talked about
Uhm uhm 
So therefore I mean with the the I think the gossip takes
uh 
Yeah
Overtakes us 
Yeah
And it's really is is played out yeah
 through us
 Yeah 
Yeah
I mean some kind of isn't it ?
Yeah 
But you know it's part of that running away that you said
in the beginning you know
That uh it's part of our uh desire to run away
Uh now English serves a very useful purpose over there
 because uh running away from our actual circumstances also
means running away from our language or from our real being and so on 
And so in the context of the staffroom uh what happens is that
we run away from those uh real things and uh 
 No you can't say that 
 And and what do we run away too you
see we are not sure 
 And what we run away too is a constructed 
 laughter you know discourse 
 It's it's a it's a constructed
world cough and uh in that world as you say of course we are
very careful that we don't violate some of the some of
the circulated norms you know
 We we we 
We we are playing the game
Yeah 
And the games for I mean for which in fact we device the
rules
Uhm
But now the rules really get better of us
Yeah
So that we game is being played by the rules in fact
Yeah 
And we are probably mean we we probably become
instruments
 Yeah 
Yeah 
So
I find that happens quite a lot to me because what
happens is uh sometimes I violate those rules laughter sometimes
I what happens is that I am know in the context of staffroom
one is not supposed to be talk talking seriously about it
That is right that is what that is that they
they that is the violation
 Or not yeah 
Yeah that's the violation 
That is
Now sometimes I put my foot in then I start talking seriously
 about something which is considered to be you know uh 
not done there and
 Uhm see see that 
 That's not done and
Yeah
 That is that is playing fouls 
And that's the one word yeah 
that's not something that yeah 
 You see it one word I I think if if
there were a referee 
Yeah
To see this match of uh yeah I mean to
monitoring this match yeah I think he he would probably 
 yeah I mean uh declare it as foul
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah that's right
Uh uh if you are being honest yeah or
you are being serious you see yeah this is this a foul play
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah
This is not admissable
 That's right 
That is exactly as my difficulty here is
Uhm 
That the say the gossip itself here
Uhm 
Say we we we we just say 
is is is a kind of a construct 
Yeah 
And it's a kind of a some kind of a game 
you see 
 Yeah yeah
Now which we are not very one word very acutely
aware of
Yeah 
You see once we once we start
playing the game
Yeah
The games get better off
Yeah
Then so do the rules
Yeah 
And so we merely are then the puppets
Yeah 
So we are just just his master's voice
Yeah
