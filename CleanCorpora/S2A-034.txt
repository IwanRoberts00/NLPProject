What I propose to do this morning is to reinforce  some of
""
""
""
""
the power underlying my perception of teaching in India  that grammar has
""
""
So grammar is not out 
""
Don't go back with the impression that grammar is out 
""
""
and soul of a human language 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
draw a sharp line 
""
""
have to have  B B
""
""
And these two types of materials will be  sentence-based grammar
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
frame-work of 
""
""
""
""
But whether  sentence-based grammar or word-based
grammar 
discourse of  we are not
""
""
""
""
We are interested in  making the
rules function 
""
How do we make use of rules  to produce language texts or
discourse materials  ?
""
So 
""
Uh an example of word-based grammar will be  B B writing
""
""
""
""
""
""
 which will also mean that
""
""
select 
""
""
Third point which I would like to reinforce is  B B writing
""
""
The 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So once again we are moving from we are not saying that form is
""
""
What we are saying is  Language is a meaningful
activity 
""
""
This is the meaning 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
human experiences  you remember the point that I made multilingual
""
""
""
""
""
When I have my Marathi glasses on this is how 
""
Now I am using English in the Marathi context of culture 
""
How do I use English  ?
""
Again inspite of all that you keep on saying  your students are
going to address you as respected sir 
""
""
""
very important  show their respect for their teachers
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And once they  the text must be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Just as a human child in the context of his L one  plays with
""
""
So we will allow a second language learner also  to play with
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  as a result of interaction what
""
variety of this language 
""
""
idiolectal varieties  to a frozen standard variety of language for the
""
""
""
""
of that language 
""
""
""
""
""
And the two important tools are 
""
""
standard reference grammar and looking up  something in a standard
""
""
When in doubt  or
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Chronicle News Time  either
""
""
of his series 
""
So there is a big demand  is this the right kind of English that
""
""
And this demand is coming from senior I A S officers  senior
""
""
 the way I am writing the way I am
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
People feel that if they are going to make a sophisticated use of
language 
""
""
""
""
""
""
varieties of standard forms also 
""
Then we have 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because what they have done is  they have captured the insights
""
""
Traditional Grammar and then put them together 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ramu's 
""
""
""
""
""
Now see 
""
A person  as a matter
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What he does every morning  ?
""
So he gets out of bed  he brushes his
teeth 
""
And then at end 
""
After they have practised language  you have a box item and
this box item is for 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
human being does  regularly
""
""
""
""
the name of that American linguist uh  it will come back
""
""
""
Lado
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No no not Fries and Lado they you we had  Rapid
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 another
""
""
""
""
Even in our text books we have to organize it in two parts 
""
""
 which the teacher is
""
""
""
For the teacher  very important for him to know that
""
""
""
""
""
passive
""
It may be some other kind of passive 
""
So the teacher must be familiar with this  that the real form
""
 the main verb or whatever verb comes after it in the past participle
form 
""
""
""
Second thing that the teacher must know is  a
""
the object and demoting the subject 
""
But this is for the teacher 
""
""
of the passive  ?
""
""
in the agent in the doer  or that the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
context governed use 
""
 that gives you a clue to the use of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
science 
""
""
autobiographical 
""
""
activity 
""
 important
""
""
of the passive 
""
Where they say  now this is done every day with good results
""
""
""
""
""
Change may be caused if you do this 
""
""
""
""
""
Man could be put into 
""
""
""
This 
""
""
""
""
""
agent or the doer
