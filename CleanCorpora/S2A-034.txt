<I>
What I propose to do this morning is to reinforce some of
the points that I made yesterday and then move on to two or
three new points 
Let me say firmly and with all the uhm with with
the power underlying my perception of teaching in India that grammar has
a very important role to play 
So grammar is not out 
Don't go back with the impression that grammar is out 
Grammar is in because as I said yesterday grammar is the heart
and soul of a human language 
No grammar no language 
Language means grammar 
Now the question is that we are teaching and learning English as a
second language how should we present the facts of grammar in a
classroom situation to facilitate the learning of English which
means use of English effectively in a variety of situations 
So it's not a question that we are not uh sitting here 
to say that alright grammar is out now 
What we are trying to say is what is going to be the best way of
presenting the facts of grammar 
So that's point number o one
 
Point number two is that it's very difficult to
draw a sharp line between grammar and lexis 
And therefore in producing our teaching materials you will
have to have two types of materials to be highlighted B B
writing 
And these two types of materials will be sentence-based grammar
 and word-based grammar 
And one of the excellent reference books at the secondary
level is even now that old Palmer's Grammar of English Words
He selected about thousand productive words and he has
presented the grammar of those words in the form of a dictionary
 It's an excellent book even now 
And we are going to do these two within the over-all
frame-work of B B writing 
So we are going to organise our materials grammar materials
in two parts sentence-based grammar and word-based grammar 
But whether it's sentence-based grammar or word-based
grammar the actual presentation will take place in the context of 
discourse of because the point that I made yesterday we are not
interested in grammar for the sake of grammar 
We are not interested in rules for the sake of rules 
We are interested in making the rules function making the
rules function 
How do we make use of rules to produce language texts or
discourse materials ?
So that's second point 
Uh an example of word-based grammar will be B B writing
 the choice of verb 
You have a network of verbs and then which one to select
 in a given context or in a given text 
And then the grammar will say Once you have selected this
 then your choice here is restricted which will also mean that
 B B writing this will rule out the possibility of 
 A that clause coming after this whereas if you
select C then you can have A 
 that clause 
Third point which I would like to reinforce is B B writing
The learner's mind is that mysterious black box 
and our ultimate objective is language as I said yesterday is a
meaningful human activity 
This is the meaning this is the experience this is human
experience 
 How do I say 
What are the possible forms that I should be using to convey this
meaning or this experience ?
And the whole thing is processed mysteriously by this
learned black box 
So once again we are moving from we are not saying that form is
useless 
What we are saying is Language is a meaningful
activity 
So what the learners have to have their focus on is 
This is the meaning this is what I propose to do 
Language that's why one of the titles of Halliday's
 important book is Learning How to Mean 
This is a very important concept 
Second language learning a second language means 
Learning how to mean in a new context of culture 
Learning how to mean 
How do I mean ?
I know how to mean in my mother tongue 
How do I mean in my other tongue which is English ?
So learning how to mean is Learning to categorise
human experiences you remember the point that I made multilingual
view of the universe bi-focal view of the universe 
This is when I have English glasses on this is how the world
appears 
When I have my Marathi glasses on this is how 
Now I am using English in the Marathi context of culture 
How do I use English ?
Again inspite of all that you keep on saying your students are
going to address you as respected sir which is not English but 
 chalta hai 
In our context of culture it's something which is
very important they want to show their respect for their teachers
So we are moving from meaning to form 
 It's movement just as yesterday we said we are moving
from fluency to accuracy 
Ultimately our ultimate objective is to help learners produce texts
And once they start producing texts the text must be
linguistically also accurate 
But we are not going to clears throat to put a check
on the fluency right at the beginning 
We are going to encourage them to play with language 
Just as a human child in the context of his L one plays with
language tries out experiments tries out all kinds of tricks 
So we will allow a second language learner also to play with
his language 
But as a teacher we are around and we keep on saying Oh
I see what you meant to say is Has he come this morning
 ?
And things like that
So what we are doing is as a result of interaction what
you are doing is exposing him to your concept of the standard
variety of this language 
So in fact all movements are from dialectal varieties
idiolectal varieties to a frozen standard variety of language for the
time being 
So we are moving from dialect from idiolect to what we
consider at a given point of time to be the standard formal variety
of that language 
Then I said that every teacher of a second language in
fact I will say also of first language has to have a set of 
B B writing reference tools 
And the two important tools are B B writing 
As teachers we must get into the habit of looking up a
standard reference grammar and looking up something in a standard
dictionary 
When in doubt go to Cobuild or
 Longman or we have had for years in the
field of E L T Advanced Learner's English Dictionary
 which we have been using
But we have now better dictionaries as reference dictionaries
Grammar I said we need three types or three levels B
B writing reference grammar 
 What do I say is this alright ?
Now you will find that in all the states in the country today
 newspapers they have I don't know about Maharashtra but down south
 Deccan Herald Hindu now Deccan
Chronicle News Time they have a column every week either
 Know Your English Subramaniam or 
Mind Your Language or Yadurajan's I forget the title
of his series 
So there is a big demand is this the right kind of English that
we are using ?
And this demand is coming from senior I A S officers senior
executives 
 Am I really right the way I am writing the way I am
drafting ?
So there is a big demand for grammar 
 It's not true that there is no demand for grammar and 
it's not at the learner's level it's at fairly
advanced level 
People feel that if they are going to make a sophisticated use of
language then they must be accurate 
So accuracy comes at that level after you have started
handling the language in your own way then at a particular level you feel
that it must be grammatically accurate 
Of course there is nothing like one standard form there are
varieties of standard forms also B B writing 
Then we have teacher's grammar 
Now the reference grammar derives all the insight from a 
linguist's grammar a linguistically oriented description of a
language and for example I will treat Quirk Greenbaum 
and Svadvik A comprehensive reference grammar of modern English
 
Because what they have done is they have captured the insights
from Transformational Grammar Chomsky's Generative Grammar 
 Halliday's Systemic Grammar Filmore's Case Grammar 
Traditional Grammar and then put them together 
So it becomes an exhaustive comprehensive description of
contemporary English 
 Teacher's grammar at different levels for teachers we
have to have different levels of grammar which the teachers will need
 in order to teach B B writing 
 Learner's grammar will have minimal of technical terms 
and the main focus will be use of language in a variety of situations 
I will give you an example in a minute 
For example B B writing we set an exercise on 
Ramu's routine activities every morning 
The focus is on every morning 
What does he do every morning ?
Now see our emphasis is on every morning 
A person who does something every morning as a matter
of habit habitually 
So although we are not saying that what we are going to have in
this text is simple or habitual present but we are highlighting that
indirectly 
Because our main thing is characteristic activities of this
person every morning 
What he does every morning ?
So he gets out of bed at six every morning he brushes his
teeth and so on so on so on 
And then at end we have a box item 
After they have practised language you have a box item and
this box item is for generalization in the form of grammar 
And we say this is what in grammar is called the simple present
And you underline the simple present 
So we are not teaching the simple present for the sake of the
simple present 
We are saying that there are certain things activities which a
human being does habitually repeatatively again and again regularly
 and that gets focused you can underline that and then at the end you have
 the simple present as a box item 
In fact this mechanism of box item was used by I forget 
the name of that American linguist uh Felix it will come back
 to my mind later 
Lado
 Haan 
Fries and Lados
No no not Fries and Lado they you we had Rapid
Review of English Grammar we have ten or twelve copies 
Prininska sir Prininska
Prininska Prininska yes Prininska
 Trusty matter that's all
Ah ha yeah 
Some Prininska
 Haan haan yeah
 A few words 
 Let's take anothe another
 example B B writing 
The passive B B writing 
Even in our text books we have to organize it in two parts 
Right at the beginning there should be uh some kind of
 some instructions built into the text which the teacher is
supposed to follow in teaching presenting that particular lesson
or that particular text item 
For the teacher it's very important for him to know that
 B B writing 
This is the formal representation 
If it's not there then it's not be 
passive
It may be some other kind of passive 
So the teacher must be familiar with this that the real form
of the passive will be a choice of a form of the verb to be followed by
 the main verb or whatever verb comes after it in the past participle
form 
 That's one thing that the teacher must know 
Second thing that the teacher must know is it's a
 mechanism a linguistic mechanism a language mechanism for promoting
the object and demoting the subject 
But this is for the teacher 
What are the situations that are that may necessitate the use
of the passive ?
The situational factors are that we are either not interested
in the agent in the doer or that the doer is unknown or that the
doer doesn't need any mention 
Then the sufferer the affected the receiver comes to
the front 
This is subject position and the verb has a marked feature
 be plus in past participle 
So the teacher must know that the use of the passive is
context governed use 
 It's the context that gives you a clue to the use of
the passive 
And if you look at your text 
You see Blood Transfusion 
Now this is a kind of text which belongs to the register of
science 
And in the register of science unless it is biographical or
autobiographical the doer is not so important 
 It's the action that is important it's the
activity that's important 
 It's the thing done that's important
So I have marked on the first two pages at least ten examples
of the passive 
Where they say now this is done every day with good results
Uh very little can be done now about this because it has already
been done 
Change may be caused if you do this 
A soldier may be brought in and put to bed 
A man's blood was changed 
Man could be put into something something something 
These were the things which were asked 
This was tried out 
It was done and so on 
So on the first two pages I find that the focus is on
activity on the action done on the thing achieved rather than on the
agent or the doer
