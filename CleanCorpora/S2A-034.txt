What I propose to do this morning is to reinforce  some of
the points that I made yesterday  two or
three new points 
""
Let me say firmly  with
the power underlying my perception of teaching in India  that grammar has
a very important role to play 
""
So grammar is not out 
""
Don't go back with the impression that grammar is out 
""
Grammar is in because as I said yesterday  grammar is the heart
and soul of a human language 
""
No grammar 
""
Language means grammar 
""
Now the question is that we are teaching and learning English as a
second language  present the facts of grammar in a
classroom situation  the learning of English which
means 
""
So 
to say that alright grammar is out now 
""
What we are trying to say is what is going to be the best way of
presenting the facts of grammar 
""
So  one
""
""
Point number two is  very difficult to
draw a sharp line 
""
And therefore in producing our teaching materials  you will
have to have  B B
writing 
""
And these two types of materials will be  sentence-based grammar
""
""
And one of the excellent  at the secondary
level is  Grammar of English Words
""
""
He selected about thousand productive words  and he has
presented the grammar of those words in the form of a dictionary
""
""
""
And we are going to do  within the over-all
frame-work of 
""
So  grammar materials
in two parts 
""
But whether  sentence-based grammar or word-based
grammar 
discourse of  we are not
interested in grammar for the sake of grammar 
""
We are not interested in rules for the sake of rules 
""
We are interested in  making the
rules function 
""
How do we make use of rules  to produce language texts or
discourse materials  ?
""
So 
""
Uh an example of word-based grammar will be  B B writing
""
""
You have a network of  and then which one to select
""
""
And then the grammar will say  Once you have selected this
 which will also mean that
""
 whereas if you
select 
""
""
Third point which I would like to reinforce is  B B writing
""
""
The 
and our ultimate objective is  language as I said yesterday is a
meaningful human activity 
""
This is the meaning  this is human
experience 
""
""
""
What are the possible forms that I should be using to convey this
meaning or this experience  ?
""
And the whole thing is processed  by this
learned 
""
So once again we are moving from we are not saying that form is
useless 
""
What we are saying is  Language is a meaningful
activity 
""
So what the learners have to have their focus on is 
This is the meaning 
""
Language  Halliday's
""
""
This is a very important concept 
""
Second language learning a second language means 
Learning how to mean in a new context of culture 
""
Learning how to mean 
""
How do I mean  ?
""
I know how to mean in my mother tongue 
""
How do I mean in my other tongue which is English  ?
""
So learning how to mean is  Learning to categorise
human experiences  you remember the point that I made multilingual
view of the universe 
""
This is when I have English glasses on  this is how the world
appears 
""
When I have my Marathi glasses on this is how 
""
Now I am using English in the Marathi context of culture 
""
How do I use English  ?
""
Again inspite of all that you keep on saying  your students are
going to address you as respected sir 
""
""
In our context of culture  something which is
very important  show their respect for their teachers
""
""
So we are moving from 
""
 we are moving
from fluency to accuracy 
""
Ultimately our ultimate objective is to help learners produce texts
""
""
And once they  the text must be
linguistically also accurate 
""
But we are not going to  to put a check
on the fluency right at the beginning 
""
We are going to encourage them to play with language 
""
Just as a human child in the context of his L one  plays with
language 
""
So we will allow a second language learner also  to play with
his language 
""
But as a teacher we are around and we keep on saying  Oh
I see  Has he come this morning
 ?
""
And things like that
""
So  as a result of interaction what
you are doing is  the standard
variety of this language 
""
So in fact all movements are  from dialectal varieties
idiolectal varieties  to a frozen standard variety of language for the
time being 
""
So we are moving  from idiolect to what we
consider at a given point of time to be the standard  variety
of that language 
""
Then I said  every teacher of a second language in
fact I will say 
B B writing 
""
And the two important tools are 
""
As teachers we must get into the habit of looking up  a
standard reference grammar and looking up  something in a standard
dictionary 
""
When in doubt  or
 in the
field of E L T  English Dictionary
 which we have been using
""
But we have now better dictionaries  as reference dictionaries
""
""
Grammar I said  B
B writing 
""
 ?
""
Now you will find that  in all the states in the country today
 down south
 Deccan
Chronicle News Time  either
""
Mind Your Language  I forget the title
of his series 
""
So there is a big demand  is this the right kind of English that
we are using  ?
""
And this demand is coming from senior I A S officers  senior
executives 
""
 the way I am writing the way I am
drafting  ?
""
So there is a big demand for grammar 
""
""
it's  at fairly
advanced level 
""
People feel that if they are going to make a sophisticated use of
language 
""
So accuracy comes at that level  started
handling the language in your own way then at a particular level you feel
that it must be 
""
Of course there is nothing like one standard form there are
varieties of standard forms also 
""
Then we have 
""
Now the reference grammar derives all the insight from a 
linguist's  a linguistically oriented description of a
language 
and Svadvik  A comprehensive reference grammar of modern English
""
""
Because what they have done is  they have captured the insights
from Transformational Grammar 
""
Traditional Grammar and then put them together 
""
So it becomes an exhaustive  comprehensive description of
contemporary English 
""
 at different levels for teachers we
have to have different levels of grammar  which the teachers will need
""
""
""
and the main focus will be use of language in a variety of situations 
""
I will give you an example in a minute 
""
For example 
Ramu's 
""
The focus is on every morning 
""
What does he do every morning  ?
""
Now see 
""
A person  as a matter
of habit 
""
So although we are not saying that what we are going to have in
this text is  but we are highlighting that
indirectly 
""
Because our main thing is  characteristic activities of this
person every morning 
""
What he does every morning  ?
""
So he gets out of bed  he brushes his
teeth 
""
And then at end 
""
After they have practised language  you have a box item and
this box item is for 
""
And we say  this is what in grammar is called the simple present
""
""
And you underline the simple present 
""
So we are not teaching the simple present for the sake of the
simple present 
""
We are saying that there are certain things activities which a
human being does  regularly
 and that gets focused you can underline that and then at the end you have
""
""
In fact this mechanism of box item was used by 
the name of that American linguist uh  it will come back

Fries and Lados
""
""
No no not Fries and Lado they you we had  Rapid
Review of English Grammar 
""
""
Prininska sir Prininska
""
""
Prininska Prininska  Prininska
""
""
 all
""
""
Ah ha yeah 
""
""
Some Prininska
""
""
 yeah
""
""
""
""
""
 another
""
""
The passive 
""
Even in our text books we have to organize it in two parts 
""
Right at the beginning  uh some kind of
 which the teacher is
supposed to follow  that particular lesson
or that particular 
""
For the teacher  very important for him to know that
""
""
This is the formal representation 
""
If 
passive
""
It may be some other kind of passive 
""
So the teacher must be familiar with this  that the real form
of the passive will be a choice of  a form of the verb to be followed by
 the main verb or whatever verb comes after it in the past participle
form 
""
""
""
Second thing that the teacher must know is  a
 for promoting
the object and demoting the subject 
""
But this is for the teacher 
""
What are the situations that are  that may necessitate the use
of the passive  ?
""
The situational factors are  that we are either not interested
in the agent in the doer  or that the
doer 
""
Then the sufferer  comes to
the front 
""
This is subject position  and the verb has a marked feature
""
""
So the teacher must know  that the use of the passive is
context governed use 
""
 that gives you a clue to the use of
the passive 
""
And if you look at 
""
You see Blood Transfusion 
""
Now this is a kind of text  which belongs to the register of
science 
""
And in the register of science unless it is biographical or
autobiographical 
""
 the
activity 
""
 important
""
So I have marked on the first two pages at least ten  examples
of the passive 
""
Where they say  now this is done every day with good results
""
""
Uh very little can be done now about this because it has already
been done 
""
Change may be caused if you do this 
""
A soldier may be brought in and put to bed 
""
A 
""
Man could be put into 
""
These were the things which were asked 
""
This 
""
It was done and so on 
""
So on the first two pages I find  that the focus is on
activity on the action done  thing achieved rather than on the
agent or the doer
