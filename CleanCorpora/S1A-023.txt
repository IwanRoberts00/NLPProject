<I>
""
""
Oh uh 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uh uh I uh can't spell it  pleasant occasion
""
""
""
Yeah surely 
that I met you
""
""
Oh thank you very much sir 
""
Uh  about an
institute where I have been 
""
""
Yeah please let me know something about the institute 
where you worked 
""
""
 what I
understand that  uh almost for
the educated people are aware of  Birla Institute of Technology
""
""
 quite
reputed one
""
""
""
""
""
You are right 
""
""
But I understand  who have
been here  uh as much aware of the institution as I expected
 rather
""
""
Well for myself atleast I 
""
""
Ah  thank you
""
Yeah  unique institute
""
in such a way that they become  what
""
with which they are able to sell themselves that are in the market 
 uh uh
""
""
""
""
""
Now-a-days the sad story about other universities and uh
higher education institutes is that the products  uh do not come out very
well equipped 
""
And they flood the market  there are no job opportunities for
them
""
""
Yeah  yeah
""
""
But uh products who come out of your 
yeah  are really absorbed
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah sure 
""
""
And uh for  quality goods there is always a
demand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah sure 
""
And more over they take a kind of uh national cream I must say 
""
And uh  half of the credit goes to rather saying that the
institute  each
brings that  fit to
the society
""
But basically they are brilliant  students when they come to the
institute
""
Because  are really
brilliant uh they score 
""
Based on their merit they get into the institute  yeah
 uh
""
""
""
""
Uh  not only that uh the best students come to this
institute
""
""
Yeah
""
""
They are also given the best  kind of training
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Uh but the best  uh
""
""
 I wish there were more institutions
of this type
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uh in the country
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Unfortunately there are only 
 like an island
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You know sea of mediocrity 
""
""
You know  good that though the institute has
been  in fact a kind
of oasis 
""
""
Yeah oasis 
""
""
Uh I was quite surprised to see  uh desert
atmosphere  uh uh G D Birla was able to establish such a great institute
 has become popular at the international level
rather
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And moreover I understand  uh come
to the  third year rather when they come to
the third year  preparing for GRE
""
""
""
Uhm  rather unfortunate
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Because we spend so much on them 
the best talent 
""
""
 a pity that India doesn't get the benefit out of
these  uh the best minds the
""
""
""
""
""
One way we have to accept this also this India is not able to
provide better opportunity 
""
So  uh foreign
United States of America  uh they are quite uh grateful to the institute
""
""
And they come forward voluntarily to see that the institute 
still further developes 
""
And uh I understand a few students have given a sort of  a
statement to the authorities that  amount
""
""
Uh its quite 
""
""
Uhm I wish not only would such an institute be updated 
but more such institutes were  uh started in other parts of the country
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And the country as a whole  uh progresses
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
But in that sense I say that I see  Pilani
 a country in
Pilani I could see
""
""
Uh
""
""
Uh national integration rather
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
Uh I could experience
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And moreover  the students are highly disciplined I must
say 
""
I was told 
""
But even at the time of the  I I could
understand that all over the country 
""
But uh that was the only institute which was functioning
""
""
Where there was no disturbances
""
""
No not at all  ah not at all
""
""
""
""
""
And uh 
uh motivated  with which they will be
able to get into better industries 
""
And one more good thing I would like to say about our institute is
 we have a practice school system
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Uh with which in fact  able to give the
better training to the students and they are able to expose their better
products  to the country rather I would say
""
""
I see 
""
""
Uh
""
""
""
""
""
See 
uh a practice school training  running of about four months at the end of
the second year 
""
And uh they got to go to  they have to go to different
industries  and do
some industrial training  but this does not mean that they can go alone
and do away  and report that they have done
the report that they have done some industrial training or something  it's
""
""
When they send the students they are sending the faculty members
also to look after 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uh  in eighty
centres all over the country 
""
""
Eighty centres  are there
""
""
""
""
""
And we have practice school too  running of about six
months 
""
And I understand there are for about thirty faculty members 
are staying outside  to look after the students
""
""
I see 
""
All the care for the students in a way  looked to their
 uh they
turn up to their best  of the
educational system that 
""
""
No I would say that  system of education
uh  there in this Pilani I would say that it is quite
application oriented
""
""
Oh I see
""
""
Uh how it would be quiet useful  to give a kind of life
skill for a student
""
""
But elsewhere we don't have this application approach at all
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
 and most of
the students who come out of these institutes  have only a theoritical
background  they
are not much of a success
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah you take for example  uh I belong to the Department
of English
""
We have MA honours in English 
""
But when I say that we have MA honours in English it doesn't mean
that the subjects  are purely confined to only the literature
field 
""
""
Oh
""
""
See for about first two years the respective of any
disciplines 
""
""
Uh
""
""
A student who is admitted in MA honours in English  he
will be exposed to thermodynamics  will be exposed to
computer science 
""
 and
chemistry
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh
""
""
So irrespective of any discipline  a student who is
admitted in  the
student  been admitted into
 MA honours in English
""
""
Oh I see 
""
""
So they are exposed to Compulsory Disciplinary Course
""
We call it CDC 
""
""
Ah right  it is a sort of
interdiscipline
""
""
""
""
""
Interdisciplinary  they call it first
integrated degree
""
""
Ah 
""
One cannot uh I should say 
should be  having been
developed  if not in our own part near
our home 
""
And uh I should compliment you on
""
""
Oh
""
""
Being on the staff of such an institute
""
""
""
""
Thank you sir
""
""
Uh it is not 
""
""
Yeah in that sense
""
""
A part of such an institution
""
""
Yeah  quite away
from 
""
I am very happy that  I am working in an institute which is
known for an academic excellence
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And the students are very bright  so we have got a kind of
job satisfaction  there,,
""
Uh uh though there are  a kind of advantages and disadvantages
""
""
But  I am really happy
""
""
Yeah we have  such an ethos
""
""
Yeah  one
really feels  apart
from uh job satisfaction
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Though I was not  now
""
Now I consider it as a kind of blessings in disguise
""
""
Yeah really  one should
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah when I left Madurai  uh
I in fact was not at all  which is
quite a far off from my place
""
""
Yeah
""
""
But now I don't have that uh feeling what should I call sense
a hallucination  I'm
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm you are all saint of the country so to say  laughter
""
""
""
And uh one more thing I would say that  uh students have
been in BITS Pilani  from south
rather
""
""
I see  rather
strange
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  uh the
admission takes place 
""
I am very happy to say that there is  not even a single seat
 for the chairman of the institute
""
""
Oh
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uh uh they don't interfere 
and 
point point  than the
percentage that is fixed that is the set marks for the admission as for as
that particular year is concenred
""
He also has to be out 
""
""
Oh 
""
We don't see this kind of a thing elsewhere 
""
See everywhere else in the country  position's
 of power and authority try to manoeuvre
""
""
Yeah
""
""
The  uh even the academic grades that
are given 
""
Sometimes the  or daughter himself or
herself get the gold medal 
ordinarily got a second class 
""
So we have heard many such stories from elsewhere 
""
But in  a really exists one should
be happy as well as proud  of such an ideally
ideal institution
""
""
""
""
""
Also  quite a known for cultural festivals
""
They  Oasis
""
""
And the students are given enormous freedom  and they collect
the funds from different sources 
""
And they are able to  uh going out the function called
 uh uh what to
say 
""
""
What  uh I mean the management
of the institute is allowed to  available in the
country to their students to their alumni 
""
They do not spare any kind of effort 
""
""
Of course the these cultural festivals are organised by
students themselves
""
""
By students themselves 
""
""
Yes 
it's  organise
""
""
""
""
""
No doubt about that all should give a kind of better training
for the students  this is what I should say
""
""
And uh moreover sir  uh though the students are prepare to
soil their hands  not the case with supposing
somebody gives the training in the name of MBA graduates or whatever  we
also have got 
""
And the students who come out with a degree MMS  I understand
that there is a report that has been received 
that the students of BITS Pilani  they are
prepared to soil their hands 
""
They are prepared to do any kind of work
""
It is not that they demand AC room they will be sitting only in
the AC room they will be able to  it is not
the quality 
""
If the situation warrants  they are prepared to do any sort of
work or they are prepared to go the field 
""
""
Yes  service motivation
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And uh  that we should instill in
our students 
""
Instead what we are producing 
brown sahibs 
""
Those who want to be  uh in offices which are air conditioned
""
""
Those who do not want to soil their hands 
""
Those who want to  think themselves the upper crust of society
 so to say
""
""
Yeah
""
""
To rule the country 
""
To rule over others 
""
And this is unfortunate
