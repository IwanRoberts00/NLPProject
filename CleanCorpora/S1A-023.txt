<I>
""
""
Oh uh 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah surely 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the educated people are aware of  Birla Institute of Technology
""
""
 quite
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
been here  uh as much aware of the institution as I expected
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  unique institute
""
in such a way that they become  what
""
with which they are able to sell themselves that are in the market 
 uh uh
""
""
""
""
""
Now-a-days the sad story about other universities and uh
""
well equipped 
""
""
them
""
""
Yeah  yeah
""
""
But uh products who come out of your 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
brilliant uh they score 
""
""
 uh
""
""
""
""
Uh  not only that uh the best students come to this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh in the country
""
""
""
""
""
""
 like an island
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
been  in fact a kind
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
atmosphere  uh uh G D Birla was able to establish such a great institute
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  rather unfortunate
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
One way we have to accept this also this India is not able to
""
""
So  uh foreign
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh I understand a few students have given a sort of  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh
""
""
Uh national integration rather
""
""
""
""
""
Uh I could experience
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
understand that all over the country 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No not at all  ah not at all
""
""
""
""
""
And uh 
""
able to get into better industries 
""
""
 we have a practice school system
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
better training to the students and they are able to expose their better
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See 
""
the second year 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
also to look after 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
months 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh they
""
educational system that 
""
""
No I would say that  system of education
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
skill for a student
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
 and most of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah you take for example  uh I belong to the Department
""
""
""
""
But when I say that we have MA honours in English it doesn't mean
""
field 
""
""
""
""
""
See for about first two years the respective of any
""
""
""
Uh
""
""
""
will be exposed to thermodynamics  will be exposed to
""
""
 and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So irrespective of any discipline  a student who is
""
student  been admitted into
 MA honours in English
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
interdiscipline
""
""
""
""
""
Interdisciplinary  they call it first
""
""
""
""
""
One cannot uh I should say 
should be  having been
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh it is not 
""
""
""
""
""
A part of such an institution
""
""
Yeah  quite away
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But  I am really happy
""
""
Yeah we have  such an ethos
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now I consider it as a kind of blessings in disguise
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I in fact was not at all  which is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a hallucination  I'm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh one more thing I would say that  uh students have
been in BITS Pilani  from south
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
admission takes place 
""
""
 for the chairman of the institute
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He also has to be out 
""
""
Oh 
""
We don't see this kind of a thing elsewhere 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The  uh even the academic grades that
""
""
Sometimes the  or daughter himself or
""
ordinarily got a second class 
""
""
""
""
""
ideal institution
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
say 
""
""
What  uh I mean the management
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
for the students  this is what I should say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that there is a report that has been received 
""
""
""
They are prepared to do any kind of work
""
""
the AC room they will be able to  it is not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  that we should instill in
our students 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 so to say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
