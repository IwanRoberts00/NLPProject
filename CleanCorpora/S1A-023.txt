<I>
Oh uh I am very happy to have met you rather 
Yeah 
Uh uh I uh can't spell it a kind of pleasant occasion
Yeah surely it's a equally a pleasure for me 
that I met you
Oh thank you very much sir 
Uh so it's uh I can say a few words about an
institute where I have been 
Yeah please let me know something about the institute 
where you worked 
 Uh yeah yeah uh that's what I
understand that people I was under the impression that uh almost for
the educated people are aware of Birla Institute of Technology
 I'm one word as it's quite
reputed one
 Yeah 
You are right 
But I understand some of our participants who have
been here are not uh as much aware of the institution as I expected
 rather
Well for myself atleast I I'm 
Ah accha thank you
Yeah uh it's in fact a kind of unique institute
 in the sense I say that uh it in fact uh motivates the students 
in such a way that they become quite uh uh what what
 should I say is acquiring a sort of managerial quality 
with which they are able to sell themselves that are in the market 
 field uh uh
 Yeah 
Now-a-days the sad story about other universities and uh
higher education institutes is that the products uh do not come out very
well equipped 
And they flood the market there are no job opportunities for
them
Yeah yeah
But uh products who come out of your institute 
yeah are really absorbed
 Yeah 
Yeah sure 
And uh for yeah quality goods there is always a
demand yeah one should say 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah sure 
And more over they take a kind of uh national cream I must say 
And uh half of the credit goes to rather saying that the
institute is able to provide something to such an extent that each
brings that there I must say uh they've become quite fit to
the society
But basically they are brilliant students when they come to the
institute
Because uh they input I would say that are really
brilliant uh they score above ninety-three percent 
Based on their merit they get into the institute yeah
 uh
 Yeah 
Uh it's not only that uh the best students come to this
institute
Yeah
They are also given the best kind of training
Yeah that's there 
Yeah
Uh but the best kind of uh
 I wish I wish there were more institutions
of this type
Yeah 
Uh in the country
Yeah
Unfortunately there are only just one or two here 
 yeah to be counted on finger's end like an island
 Yeah 
Yeah laughter 
You know sea of mediocrity 
You know it's good that though the institute has
been in Rajasthan uh I would say that it it's in fact a kind
of oasis 
Yeah oasis 
Uh I was quite surprised to see how in that uh desert
atmosphere uh uh G D Birla was able to establish such a great institute
 uh which in fact has become popular at the international level
rather
Yeah 
And moreover I understand when our students uh come
to the third level which we say third year rather when they come to
the third year their attention is mainly towards preparing for GRE
 and get out of this country 
Uhm that's rather unfortunate
Yeah
Because we spend so much on them and the best mind 
the best talent the best energies of the country flow out of it 
 yeah 
 It's a pity that India doesn't get the benefit out of
these uh the best minds the
 Yeah 
One way we have to accept this also this India is not able to
provide better opportunity uh to their expectations rather 
So and I am very happy still the students uh foreign
United States of America uh they are quite uh grateful to the institute
 uh the what to say is to their almamater 
And they come forward voluntarily to see that the institute 
still further developes 
And uh I understand a few students have given a sort of a
statement to the authorities that uh they are collecting some amount
 which would in fact uh update the computer centre 
Uh its quite uh remarkable approach on their part I feel 
Uhm I wish not only would such an institute be updated 
but more such institutes were uh started in other parts of the country
 so that uh all the regions stand to benefit 
Yeah
And the country as a whole yeah uh progresses
 Yeah 
Yeah 
But in that sense I say that I see in Pilani
 I must say all the states a country a country in
Pilani I could see
Uh
Uh national integration rather
Yeah yeah
Uh I could experience
Yeah 
And moreover the students are highly disciplined I must
say 
I was told by then I wasn't there 
But even at the time of the Mandal Commissions I I could
understand that all over the country the students were on strike 
But uh that was the only institute which was functioning
Where there was no disturbances
No not at all very kind ah not at all
 Very kind 
And uh the students you know because they are much 
uh motivated uh towards getting trained with which they will be
able to get into better industries 
And one more good thing I would like to say about our institute is
 we have a practice school system
Uhm
Uh with which in fact they're able to give the
better training to the students and they are able to expose their better
products to the country rather I would say
I see 
Uh
 Haan 
See we have a practice school system in such a sense 
uh a practice school training running of about four months at the end of
the second year uhn 
And uh they got to go to they have to go to different
industries where the students are expected to go and do
some industrial training but this does not mean that they can go alone
and do away with some work and get and report that they have done
the report that they have done some industrial training or something it's
 not 
When they send the students they are sending the faculty members
also to look after 
 Uhn 
Uhm 
Uh this programme is going on for about in eighty
centres all over the country 
Eighty centres eighty centres are there
 Eighty centres 
And we have practice school too running of about six
months 
And I understand there are for about thirty faculty members 
are staying outside to look after the students
I see 
All the care for the students in a way and looked to their
 academic upbringing in all possible ways so that uh they
turn up to their best uh lot the best products of the
educational system that uh exist in the country 
No I would say that uh in fact the system of education
uh that's there in this Pilani I would say that it is quite
application oriented
Oh I see
Uh how it would be quiet useful to give a kind of life
skill for a student
But elsewhere we don't have this application approach at all
Yeah
 It's only a theoritical approach and most of
the students who come out of these institutes have only a theoritical
background and in the practical world yeah they
are not much of a success
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah you take for example uh I belong to the Department
of English
We have MA honours in English 
But when I say that we have MA honours in English it doesn't mean
that the subjects taught are purely confined to only the literature
field 
Oh
See for about first two years the respective of any
disciplines they are exposed to common these common subjects 
Uh
A student who is admitted in MA honours in English he
will be exposed to thermodynamics I see will be exposed to
computer science 
 He'll be exposed to physics uh and
chemistry
 I see 
 Uh 
Uh
So irrespective of any discipline a student who is
admitted in uh computer science will be doing the same course of the
student who has who has who has been admitted into
 MA honours in English
Oh I see 
So they are exposed to Compulsory Disciplinary Course
We call it CDC only when they come to the third year 
Ah right again it is a sort of
interdiscipline
 Again 
Interdisciplinary that's why they call it first
integrated degree
Ah 
One cannot uh I should say one should be 
should be happy to see such an institution having been
developed in some part of the country if not in our own part near
our home 
And uh I should compliment you on
Oh
Being on the staff of such an institute
 Laughter 
Thank you sir
Uh it is not everybody's lot to be 
Yeah in that sense
A part of such an institution
Yeah I'm really happy though I'm quite away
from my home town 
I am very happy that I am working in an institute which is
known for an academic excellence
Yeah
And the students are very bright so we have got a kind of
job satisfaction that's there,,
Uh uh though there are a kind of advantages and disadvantages
 as far as my personal point of view is concerned 
But as an academician I am really happy
Yeah we have such an ethos
Yeah uh ethos and academic excellence exist one
really feels one is previleged to get in there apart
from uh job satisfaction
 There 
Yeah 
Though I was not uh as happy as I am now
Now I consider it as a kind of blessings in disguise
Yeah really yeah one should
 Yeah 
Yeah when I left Madurai where I had been working uh
I in fact was not at all uh willing to go to such a place which is
quite a far off from my place
Yeah
But now I don't have that uh feeling what should I call sense
a hallucination uh I'm not I'm
 not at all suffering from that 
 Uh 
Uhm you are all saint of the country so to say laughter
And uh one more thing I would say that uh students have
been in BITS Pilani are uh quite more in number from south
rather
I see oh that's uh yeah rather
strange
 Yeah 
Yeah that I would say is truely beecause uh the
admission takes place is done merit 
I am very happy to say that there is not even a single seat
 for the chairman of the institute
Oh
 It's really remarkable 
Yeah 
Uh uh they don't interfere in the admission process 
and even if the Vice-Chancellor's son gets 
point point point one percent less than the
percentage that is fixed that is the set marks for the admission as for as
that particular year is concenred
He also has to be out 
Oh that's really remarkable 
We don't see this kind of a thing elsewhere 
See everywhere else in the country people in position's
 of power and authority try to manoeuvre
Yeah
The the admissions uh even the academic grades that
are given 
Sometimes the professor's son or daughter himself or
herself get the gold medal though they might have not even 
ordinarily got a second class let alone a first class 
So we have heard many such stories from elsewhere 
But in at Pilani such a thing a really exists one should
be happy as well as proud uhm also of such an ideally
ideal institution
 Uhm also 
Also it's quite a known for cultural festivals
They celebrate a festival called Oasis
 which is once in a year 
And the students are given enormous freedom and they collect
the funds from different sources I mean many firms are sponsoring 
And they are able to uh going out the function called
 Oasis in such a manner that it is uh uh what to
say uh known and famous at the national level 
What one or two words uh I mean the management
of the institute is allowed to keep for the best available in the
country to their students to their alumni 
They do not spare any kind of effort 
Of course the these cultural festivals are organised by
students themselves
By students themselves 
Yes it's they who collect the fund 
it's they who collect fund organise
 It's they who collect fund 
No doubt about that all should give a kind of better training
for the students this is what I should say
And uh moreover sir uh though the students are prepare to
soil their hands anywhere it's not the case with supposing
somebody gives the training in the name of MBA graduates or whatever we
also have got a degree programme called MMS 
And the students who come out with a degree MMS I understand
that there is a report that has been received uh from different firms 
that the students of BITS Pilani specially MMS candidates they are
prepared to soil their hands 
They are prepared to do any kind of work
It is not that they demand AC room they will be sitting only in
the AC room they will be able to only manage the sub-staff it is not
the quality 
If the situation warrants they are prepared to do any sort of
work or they are prepared to go the field 
Yes it is that kind of uh service motivation
Yeah
And uh committment to work that we should instill in
our students 
Instead what we are producing these days is uh 
brown sahibs 
Those who want to be uh in offices which are air conditioned
Those who do not want to soil their hands 
Those who want to think themselves the upper crust of society
 born they heavenly born one word so to say
Yeah
To rule the country 
To rule over others 
And this is unfortunate
