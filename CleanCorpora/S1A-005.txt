<I>
""
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
 fine
""
""
fifteen days  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh why the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
happens like that  which
""
""
So  parties
""
""
""
""
""
many governments which are formed 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
formed by three parties
""
France in Europe France  uh got uh uh so in the
""
Socialists have have joined 
""
""
""
""
Naturally if Mitterand President Mitterand can run his government
for a period of ten years  India cannot have a
government  uh party uh national party national
""
uh in some some political parties like Congress-I Congress-S  or even
""
""
""
Why we  we can have a very beautiful government very
""
""
Uh  and the composition of that
""
members belong to C PI-M some members belong to Janata Dal but all these
""
""
So in that way we can form a government
""
""
""
""
""
very used to this this kind of situation because uh  in the in the past
""
""
Only 
""
""
But now it is the something different 
""
""
because of we are not used to that 
""
""
together 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay Basu 
""
Just think what I what I want to say 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So west is not 
""
""
""
""
""
first of all  if those governments in Europe and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
First of all Congress-I has no power  of of what do you think
""
Do you think that India is  basically has got one culture
""
Or do you believe that India 
""
""
this is a concept which has been imposed by the British upon the Indians 
""
India in the ancient past was not together 
""
India in the  was not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
culture 
""
""
of all the communities belonging to different cultures  all
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
nation 
""
 your opinion what do you say
""
""
Uhm now now see Chakraborti  the proverb goes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
their separate cultures 
""
""
Japan has a particular culture British has a particular culture uh America
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Variety in Indian culture is something  uh something which you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 some
""
""
""
""
 you think that it is the religion which can
""
""
""
""
""
mind of a person 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
religion 
""
""
Actually frankly speaking I 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  so you have come to the same point again that India is
""
divergent  are living together should live together in the
""
of all 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
miscellaneous divergent  in India are of divergent
qualities  which will
""
""
""
then also we can arrive at a conclusion that  we should have different
cooks in New Delhi 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We must have to invite  uh so that uh our
""
""
""
""
know that it is going through a very  and uh in
""
""
Otherwise uh we are going to face a bit difficult situation in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
After two months if this government or or say after three months if
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Burning one during the time of Mrs Indira Gandhi 
""
""
mishandling of some political leaders  these
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the first 
""
And we know that uh there are uh suppressed 
""
""
We know that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think uh that is very much true that sometimes  uh uh
""
very 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to revolt against this type of uh  uh behaviour
""
""
""
management financial mismanagement of the Central government is one of their
""
in our country and one region is  uh being developed at the cost of other
""
""
""
like eastern regions
""
Uh people living in the eastern regions  are lagging behind and
""
or ethnic crisis or
