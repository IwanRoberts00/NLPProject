""
Uh 
""
How are you
""
""
Uhm 
""
Chakraborti how are you
""
""
 fine
""
Uh you for the last uh  for the last ten
fifteen days  the
transformation  the Centre
""
What is your opinion
""
What you think about it 
""
""
Actually mm  I was
reading a newspaper today  I found that uh
 uh why the
people of India are crying uh 
of the  future democratic
""
It is  crying so much about
the 
""
This is this is their comment and I think that uh  okay if it
happens like that  which
""
""
So  parties
they if they join together I think the country will run 
""
""
""
Israel even in  there are
many governments which are formed 
""
Single party  uh is ruling the country like India
""
This type of thing is very rare particularly in this decade  and
if that be so  by
many parties say three or four parties
""
Israel has got a government recently and that government  is
formed by three parties
""
France in Europe France  uh got uh uh so in the
government  French government you find that a Communists or
Socialists have have joined 
""
Mitterand has got one  who
belongs to the radical party or that communist party
""
Naturally if Mitterand President Mitterand can run his government
for a period of ten years  India cannot have a
government  uh party uh national party national
party representing the national capital or some progressive elements  uh
uh in some some political parties like Congress-I Congress-S  or even
Janata Dal  uh
communist party or socialist party 
""
Why we  we can have a very beautiful government very
viable government very feasible government in our country
""
Uh  and the composition of that
government can be  uh say uh some members belong to Congress-I some
members belong to C PI-M some members belong to Janata Dal but all these
elements should be progressive 
""
So in that way we can form a government
""
What is your opinion
""
""
I as I think  the people of India are not
very used to this this kind of situation because uh  in the in the past
they had not uh 
""
Only 
one party 
""
But now it is the something different 
""
It is different means uh 
because of we are not used to that 
and  uh
this  will progress and if so many parties come
together 
""
So naturally there will be clash and uhm 
would wouldn't be able to survive
""
This is the this is the fear  this is the fear
""
I  not very much
""
uhm 
""
But uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay Basu 
""
Just think what I what I want to say 
""
First of all  or the
seventees 
""
One of the reasons of Indian  exposure to the West
is undoubtedly television  the proximity between Indian people and
the western people  uh which has been made through different types of
exchange
""
Political exchange  exchange or
scholars exchange of scholars  exchange of technocrats
""
So west is not 
""
I think  west
and the east 
""
Naturally if the governments in those countries are viable 
first of all  if those governments in Europe and
Japan  if those
governments are viable or can run smoothly  uh we also can have a
government of that type
""
When  the so called national party Congress-I has disintegrated
""
""
First of all Congress-I has no power  of of what do you think
""
Do you think that India is  basically has got one culture
""
Or do you believe that India 
""
Or if you  you think that
this is a concept which has been imposed by the British upon the Indians 
""
India in the ancient past was not together 
""
India in the  was not
""
""
India became one 
""
Naturally British united India for the sake of the smooth
administration 
""
Now we are running after the same 
""
We are running after that that uh that same cultural identity
""
I I I  say that India should be disintegrated
""
No not that
""
But cultural  uh I mean uh India has got a a heterogeneous
culture 
""
Heterogeneous national entity  and for the sake of the interest
of all the communities belonging to different cultures  all
the communities should live together peacefully 
""
I mean it is a mutual interest  and Congress-I cannot offer us
at present a  cannot present us a viable
government with the help of which it can  rule the whole of the country
""
""
What is your opinion  our
nation 
""
 your opinion what do you say
""
""
Uhm now now see Chakraborti  the proverb goes
like that that uhm 
""
Uh this is a  the present
situation 
""
But still  stick to this kind of
proverb 
""
Sometimes  of India
 and they have
their separate cultures 
""
Naturally  every nation has as India has a particular culture
Japan has a particular culture British has a particular culture uh America
has got a American people have got their own culture
""
So 
""
Yeah yes  uh within the country
 the variety
""
""
""
Variety in Indian culture is something  uh something which you
""
""
Uh particularly in European
""
""
In what sense do you think that
""
""
 some
 uh communities
live and there is a there is a cultural difference 
""
""
 you think that it is the religion which can
unite 
""
""
No I  religion
is something  the
mind of a person 
""
It it it goes like that but  religion
is something  in order to
gain something 
""
You are putting some aspersions on religion  or those religious
 to use their
religion 
""
""
Actually frankly speaking I 
in any kind of religion because  means when I say that I
am  uh Buddhist like that that
""
""
Only the 
""
Humanism is our religion 
""
Humanity 
""
Nothing else 
""
""
So  so you have come to the same point again that India is
a country in which  people of uh
divergent  are living together should live together in the
years to come atleast in the  for the interest
of all 
""
So how can you expect  that one particular political party say
Congress-I should rule 
uh number of  belonging
to different cultural entities
""
How can you think
""
I can't make out this thing
""
How can you think a political party like Congress-I should rule 
for our country 
allow other cooks to work together 
""
I think if all the cooks are invited  and the taste will be
miscellaneous divergent  in India are of divergent
qualities  which will
be prepared by different cooks 
""
So you must 
then also we can arrive at a conclusion that  we should have different
cooks in New Delhi 
""
""
""
""
Yes that is uh okay 
""
That is very right
""
That  have any
other alternative 
""
We must have to invite  uh so that uh our
country will  it can prosper
""
""
Uh it can prosper  uh you
know that it is going through a very  and uh in
order to survive that we must join our our hands together 
""
Otherwise uh we are going to face a bit difficult situation in
future  so
""
""
What type of difficult situation you anticipate
""
If this government fails in the months  to come say two or two
three months
""
After two months if this government or or say after three months if
this government fails  what type of apprehensions
""
""
""
I think that uh  uh you
know that 
""
""
Oh it was also during that uh Punjab problem was very much 
uh the living  Mrs Indira Gandhi
""
""
Uh Assam problem of Assam  burning problem
""
Burning one during the time of Mrs Indira Gandhi 
""
So  almost due due to
mishandling of some political leaders  these
problems have transformed themselves into something ethnic problem 
""
So these problems are not new 
""
These problems are very common to us we are habituated
""
We are accustomed to these problems 
""
""
Yes we are accustomed but uh see that if  uh uh Punjab was
the first 
""
And we know that uh there are uh suppressed 
anger  in uh different parts of India
""
We know that 
""
So that exact due to the  uh is the is that due to the lopsided
growth or uneven growth  uh uneven growth of particular regions at
the cost of others 
""
Do you think so
""
""
I think uh that is very much true that sometimes  uh uh
that government  they say that Bihar is a
very 
and uh very 
""
And so they uhm they uhm they uh 
develop 
""
And if it happens like that  uh in the allocation of money
 is going
to revolt against this type of uh  uh behaviour
""
""
So you think that mismanagement financial mismanagement
management financial mismanagement of the Central government is one of their
important reasons  uh this lopsided uneven growth economic growth
in our country and one region is  uh being developed at the cost of other
regions
""
Naturally the region which is lagging behind the regions  uh
like eastern regions
""
Uh people living in the eastern regions  are lagging behind and
they are harbouring a kind of discontentment resulting in a kind of political
or ethnic crisis or
