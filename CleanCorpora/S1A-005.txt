<I>
Uh hello Basu 
How are you
Uhm hello 
Chakraborti how are you
 I'm fine
Uh you for the last uh ten to fifteen days for the last ten
fifteen days we are going to have a uh new political uh the
transformation both in the State and the Centre
What is your opinion
What you think about it 
Actually mm what I think is uhm that uh I was
reading a newspaper today in the morning and uh I found that uh
 some uh some foreigners commented that it is uh why the
people of India are crying uh or crying about the possibility 
of the future democratic
It is that means it is why they are crying so much about
the about the uh existence of democracy in India 
This is this is their comment and I think that uh okay if it
happens like that uh and uh this uh formation of government which
 because it is a democracy so so many parties are there 
So if it is uh uhm most of the uh parties
they if they join together I think the country will run well 
 Don't you think Basu in your home in Japan in 
Israel even in uh Sri Lanka in these countries uh there are
many governments which are formed uh by many parties 
Single party uh is ruling the country like India
This type of thing is very rare particularly in this decade and
if that be so if Japan can have a government formed by man by
many parties say three or four parties
Israel has got a government recently and that government is
formed by three parties
France in Europe France France has uh got uh uh so in the
government Fre Fre French government you find that a Communists or
Socialists have have joined 
Mitterand has got one uh ca cabinet colleague who
belongs to the radical party or that communist party
Naturally if Mitterand President Mitterand can run his government
for a period of ten years uh why In India cannot have a
government consisting of some uh party uh national party national
party representing the national capital or some progressive elements uh
uh in some some political parties like Congress-I Congress-S or even
Janata Dal with some uh radical members belonging to uh
communist party or socialist party 
Why we ca we can have a very beautiful government very
viable government very feasible government in our country
Uh and the government and the and the composition of that
government can be uh say uh some members belong to Congress-I some
members belong to C PI-M some members belong to Janata Dal but all these
elements should be progressive 
So in that way we can form a government
What is your opinion
I as I think uh that uh the people of India are not
very used to this this kind of situation because uh in the in the past
they had not uh this kind of I mean the long past 
Only only one party uh uh ruled the our country 
one party 
But now it is the something different 
It is different means uh because that is why I I say that 
because of we are not used to that because we are traditionally 
and we think that uh only if there is only one party then uh
this uh our country will progress and if so many parties come
together uh there is a ideological differences 
So naturally there will be clash and uhm our democracy 
would wouldn't be able to survive
This is the this is the fear this is the fear
I I'm not very much uhm I'm not very much
 sure whether uh this government is going to survive 
uhm 
But uh let us see that is 
 Uhm 
Okay Basu 
Just think what I what I want to say 
First of all the people of India of the sixtees or the
seventees were not adequately exposed to the West 
One of the reasons of Indian people's exposure to the West
is undoubtedly television and the proximity between Indian people and
the western people uh which has been made through different types of
exchange
Political exchange uh tourist exchange tourist exchange or
scholars exchange of scholars or ex exchange of technocrats
So west is not at present times totally alien to us 
I think there is a kind of close proximity between the west
and the east 
Naturally if the governments in those countries are viable 
first of all if that gover if those governments in Europe and
Japan and in Is Israel even in Sri Lanka if those
governments are viable or can run smoothly uh we also can have a
government of that type
When the so called national party Congress-I has disintegrated
 uh itself into different segments 
First of all Congress-I has no power of of what do you think
Do you think that India is basically has got one culture
Or do you believe that India has got an unity in diversity 
Or if you don't believe it don't you think that
this is a concept which has been imposed by the British upon the Indians 
India in the ancient past was not together 
India in the even in the Muslim period India is not was not
 one was not a one country 
India became one and united during this time of the British 
Naturally British united India for the sake of the smooth
administration 
Now we are running after the same cultural uh identity 
We are running after that that uh that same cultural identity
I I I don't say that India should be disintegrated
No not that
But cultural uh I mean uh India has got a a heterogeneous
culture 
Heterogeneous national entity and for the sake of the interest
of all the communities belonging to different cultures should all
the communities should live together peacefully 
I mean it is a mutual interest and Congress-I cannot offer us
at present a a a a cannot ca cannot present us a viable
government with the help of which it can rule the whole of the country
What is your opinion about the cultural entity of our
nation 
 What's your opinion what do you say
Uhm now now see Chakraborti it is uh the proverb goes
like that that uhm too many cooks spoil the broth 
Uh this is a proverb and I think that in the present
situation uh this proverb uh can go well 
But still uhm though I don't stick to this kind of
proverb because uh yes I do agree with you 
Sometimes uhm the people uh sorry people of India
 they are they belong to different communities and they have
their separate cultures 
Naturally every nation has as India has a particular culture
Japan has a particular culture British has a particular culture uh America
has got a American people have got their own culture
So there is there is a cultural dissimilarity 
Yeah yes uh a separate culture means uh within the country
 not so vast uh the variations the variety
 I'm talking about the variety 
Variety in Indian culture is something uh something which you
 don't find in uh the western countries 
Uh particularly in European
In what sense do you think that
 Let's suppose our we are Bengalis and uh some
 there are some other states where some other uh communities
live and there is a there is a cultural difference 
 Don't you think that it is the religion which can
unite all the people belonging to different cultures 
No I don't think that uhm because religion
is something uhm something which uh should uhm ennoble the
mind of a person 
It it it goes like that but you see in our India religion
is something which is uh manipulated in some in order to
gain something 
You are putting some aspersions on religion or those religious
 reli religious leaders who uh uh who try to use their
religion 
Actually frankly speaking I don't believe in the 
in any kind of religion because religion only means when I say that I
am a Hindu and you are a Muslim or he is a uh Buddhist like that that
 separates us us that creates a wall between us 
Only the religion is uh the humanism 
Humanism is our religion 
Humanity so uh I think that only this should exist 
Nothing else 
So so you have come to the same point again that India is
a country in which peoples of different cultures people of uh
divergent states are living together should live together in the
years to come atleast in the thousand years to come for the interest
of all 
So how can you expect that one particular political party say
Congress-I should rule or can rule such a big country with vast 
uh number of pa pa I mean with a vast population belonging
to different cultural entities
How can you think
I can't make out this thing
How can you think a political party like Congress-I should rule 
for our country because he is a single cook and you don't 
allow other cooks to work together 
I think if all the cooks are invited and the taste will be
miscellaneous divergent and as the pople in India are of divergent
qualities divergent traits and characters these dishes which will
be prepared by different cooks will be palatable to all 
So you must you too at if I accept your one word 
then also we can arrive at a conclusion that we should have different
cooks in New Delhi 
 What's your opinion 
Yes that is uh okay 
That is very right
That uh in the present situation we don't have any
other alternative 
We must have to invite uh so many cooks uh so that uh our
country will so that our country survives and uh it can prosper
Uh it can prosper uh otherwise uh our country is uh you
know that it is going through a very uh critical time and uh in
order to survive that we must join our our hands together 
Otherwise uh we are going to face a bit difficult situation in
future so
What type of difficult situation you anticipate
If this government fails in the months to come say two or two
three months
After two months if this government or or say after three months if
this government fails what type of uh what type of apprehensions
 what type of misgivings you think you anticipate 
I think that uh in different parts of India uh you
know that uh about Punjab and uh Assam 
Oh it was also during that uh Punjab problem was very much 
uh the living dur even during the time of Mrs Indira Gandhi
Uh Assam problem of Assam was also a very burning problem
Burning one during the time of Mrs Indira Gandhi 
So these problems are new to us almost due due to
mishandling of some political leaders uh these handlings these
problems have transformed themselves into something ethnic problem 
So these problems are not new 
These problems are very common to us we are habituated
We are accustomed to these problems 
Yes we are accustomed but uh see that if uh uh Punjab was
the first then Assam came 
And we know that uh there are uh suppressed uh supressed 
anger in uh different parts of India
We know that 
So that exact due to the uh is the is that due to the lopsided
growth or uneven growth of uh uneven growth of particular regions at
the cost of others 
Do you think so
I think uh that is very much true that sometimes uh uh
that government uh just intentionally they say that Bihar is a
very uh backward because the people of Bihar are very uh idle 
and uh very uh they don't work at all 
And so they uhm they uhm they uh this state will not 
develop 
And if it happens like that uh in the allocation of money
 if it happens like that then naturally the people of Bihar is going
to revolt against this type of uh uh behaviour
So you think that mismanagement financial mismanagement
management financial mismanagement of the Central government is one of their
important reasons for uh this lopsided uneven growth economic growth
in our country and one region is uh being developed at the cost of other
regions
Naturally the region which is lagging behind the regions uh
like eastern regions
Uh people living in the eastern regions are lagging behind and
they are harbouring a kind of discontentment resulting in a kind of political
or ethnic crisis or sometimes in secessionist movements
