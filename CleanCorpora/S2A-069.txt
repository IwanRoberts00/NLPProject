It is duly proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt
""
""
My Lord in this case  were
 uh the P W six and P W seven
""
Now P W seven  only he pointed out there are three watchmen are
there My Lord 
""
Only he stated three watchmen  uhn
""
""
Two 
""
""
Two two
""
""
There are uh one he includes that the 
 from the north
""
""
No when I come to read this thing no ?
""
""
So data should be 
""
""
No that I come to look at and then that  idea in
the mind  got then I am going to come to that point my lord
""
""
Uh if there are three watchmen  then I put the
specific question Mr 
record  the statement of the if there were any watchman first point
""
""
He says he has not recorded 
""
Secondly nobody has  the
society  or P W six or P W seven
""
This is a registered premises given 
""
""
They are residing together 
""
And second thing they could  possibles
have to prove  the watchman should come and make a statement before the
police officer or before the court  we are
residing there along with this accused person 
""
We are residing the  we are three watchmen of this
building 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
question  if we put up the whether you have recorded a statement of
the any watchman 
""
So it is burden of the prosecution that  to establish the guilt
on 
""
Here the watchman has to come say  Yes this accused was
residing there 
 any watchman has pointed this is a shirt
which belongs to accused number  this article belongs to this
accused 
""
There there is no evidence at all 
""
Only the  and then only on suspect
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
This is one aspect so there is no connection with the this
shirt with the accused 
""
When uh 
""
panchnama 
""
Now now 
""
Only P W six and seven said when this shirt was shown to them 
when this article seven  article
seven 
""
When this shirt was shown to them they identified  so question
was put up 
Did you 
""
They said 
""
""
Now page twenty my lord 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Page twenty my lord 
 when he was cross examined I want
that part my lord 
""
Para para two 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
My lord may I read with your permission
""
""
Yes
""
""
I have maintained a register of society employees
""
The employees would not provide any any form 
""
I will not give them the description of clothes of the accused 
in my statement before the police 
""
So I do not recollect whether article shown to me in the 
possession 
""
Article shown to me I had not checked up the label of mark of shirt
article and the article shown to me  by police it was not taken out of
sealed packet  article seven not sealed in my presence after it is shown
to me 
""
With with great respect to my submission  there are two things
from the 
""
Before showing this there there is no description 
""
Second point when this shirt was shown  he
doesn't he he  whether
such 
""
""
So therefore it  inadmissable under section one
sixty-two 
""
Because if it should be
""
""
Shirt was not taken in the hand of  in the presence of two
""
""
""
No no they did not when 
inst  and shirt was shown but it was
not shown in the presence of 
""
This 
which it was not shown in the presence of 
therefore it is hid by under section one sixty-two 
""
""
Hence the statement must be  seized and statement was
recorded by by 
""
""
It was recorded  when the subsequent shirt was shown to
them 
""
So so that question is put whether this shirt was shown in the
presence of 
""
""
Whether these shirts
""
""
Article seven
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Whether it was shown to in the presence of  panchas
""
""
""
What
""
""
Shown
""
""
It shown
""
""
Shown disclosed
""
""
Whether this shirt
""
""
Sir was
""
""
Or your point is that this article seven shirt was not shown
in the presence of  P W six and P W and seven
""
""
Seven yes my lord
""
""
You wanted to prove that article should be shown in the
presence of 
""
""
 yes my lord
""
""
In the presence of 
""
""
If  if it does show on then it is hit hit by
under one section sixty-two my lord 
""
""
If it is sealed earlier  then it should be
sealed should be opened opened in the presence of 
and then only it can be shown
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
Well uh we  if it is this shirt
now their case is  taken under
charge of 
number two 
""
And it is their case it was sealed  if it
is so sealed  broken
 and this
shirt should be shown in the  shown to in in the presence of
""
""
That is that is one aspect 
""
I  there there was no
sealing 
""
Because this  there were no
sealing and subsequently sent to C A my lord 
""
After later days 
""
That is one point 
""
My lord P W seven 
""
""
After showing this shirt  to P W uh six and
seven  you normally your witness is one zero two
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Only two  two is
""
""
Apart from P W number six and seven it was not shown to the
others
""
""
No there there other  were there my
lord 
""
""
""
""
""
No they they would be just
""
""
Article seven apart from  interruption
""
""
""
So only they want to they they established that the article
seven in connection with three my lord 
""
So with my respectful seven that  the P W six or seven they
admitted possession  before showing this shirt they have not given
description of article  and it
would not show in the  If
it is sealed it this seal was not 
 in so therefore we had doubt about this genuiness
about this  prosecution
""
That is one aspect 
""
Now my lord whether further if I may take  further evidence my
lord 
""
That 
important of the prosecution witness 
""
Now 
""
Page nine cross section para two 
""
Para two my lord 
""
My  when this article
seven 
manufacturing  I'll
 uh uh
""
""
Manufacturing mark of
""
""
Means there is need no  this
shirt was 
""
""
Trade mark
""
""
Trade marks  tra
 they might
pointed out before in the  nino
""
""
This there is no reference of manufacturing label 
article seven in exhibit eight  similar shirts shirts like this are freely
available in the market 
""
So this there is  was
explain 
""
Now my lord the there is one point  similar question
were put up P W six and seven whether there is any label or trade marks 
whether did you point out in  uh or in your
statement or in 
""
My lord 
""
Now my lord  P W two further says when this shirt was found on
the flooring  it uh he further says the blood stains mark mark by police
with the pen 
""
The shirt was then sealed and packed and labeled 
""
So it is presumed that the return must have must have done  at
that time in the premises my lord 
""
That is one aspect 
""
""
Yes
""
""
That is 
""
This is 
panchanama  on twenty-seventh July ninety-one
""
""
Yes 
""
""
That is there case it was sealed mark everything,
""
Now my lord  when they are
searching 
were there
