<I>
It is duly proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt
 that is main point 
My Lord in this case that only this was there were
 two witness from the society uh the P W six and P W seven
Now P W seven only he pointed out there are three watchmen are
there My Lord three watchmen 
Only he stated three watchmen uhn
Two 
Two two
There are uh one he includes that the watchmens 
 watchmen are here in the society from the north
No when I come to read this thing no ?
So data should be of three watchmen 
No that I come to look at and then that what idea in
the mind you've got then I am going to come to that point my lord
Uh if there are three watchmen are there then I put the
specific question Mr Pimpulkar did you recorded 
record the statement of the if there were any watchman first point
He says he has not recorded 
Secondly nobody has from from the
society or watchman or P W six or P W seven
This is a registered premises given to to 
 these three watchmen 
They are residing together 
And second thing they could the would be possibles
have to prove the watchman should come and make a statement before the
police officer or before the court that ke we are
residing there along with this accused person 
We are residing the this we are three watchmen of this
building uhm 
Yes 
 Nahi uh que que 
question if we put up the whether you have recorded a statement of
the any watchman he say No 
So it is burden of the prosecution that to establish the guilt
on uh accu this accused 
Here the watchman has to come say Yes this accused was
residing there when this article seven was seized then 
 no no not any watchman has pointed this is a shirt
which belongs to accused number s this article belongs to this
accused 
There there is no evidence at all 
Only the only shirt was found and then only on suspect
 they drawn the inference my lord 
Yes
This is one aspect so there is no connection with the this
shirt with the accused 
When uh when this shirt was searched se 
 sealed with when shirt was taken under the 
panchnama my lord 
Now now now next point uh next point my lord 
Only P W six and seven said when this shirt was shown to them 
when this article seven I'll argue only on this point article
seven 
When this shirt was shown to them they identified so question
was put up before showing this shirt Whe 
Did you Have you given description of this shirt 
They said No we have not given description of shirt 
Now page twenty my lord 
Yes
Page twenty my lord pa para 
 six page page two two zero when he was cross examined I want
that part my lord 
Para para two para two 
Yes 
My lord may I read with your permission
Yes
I have maintained a register of society employees
The employees would not provide any any form 
I will not give them the description of clothes of the accused 
in my statement before the police 
So I do not recollect whether article shown to me in the 
possession of panchas known by the police 
Article shown to me I had not checked up the label of mark of shirt
article and the article shown to me by police it was not taken out of
sealed packet article seven not sealed in my presence after it is shown
to me 
With with great respect to my submission there are two things
from the two things maybe gathered from this this evidence 
Before showing this there there is no description 
Second point when this shirt was shown He doesn't he
doesn't he he do does not remember whether
such whether shirt was shown in the presence of panchas 
 or not 
So therefore it is inadmissable under section one
sixty-two ci ci Evidence Act 
Because if it should be
Shirt was not taken in the hand of in the presence of two
 two panchas 
No no they did not when when statement was recorded 
inst of the P W six and P W seven and shirt was shown but it was
not shown in the presence of panchas 
This this uh uh article seven this affects article 
which it was not shown in the presence of panchas 
therefore it is hid by under section one sixty-two 
Hence the statement must be seized and statement was
recorded by by 
It was recorded when the subsequent shirt was shown to
them 
So so that question is put whether this shirt was shown in the
presence of panchas or not 
Whether these shirts
Article seven
Ah ha
Whether it was shown to in the presence of panchas
What
Shown
It shown
Shown disclosed
Whether this shirt
Sir was
Or your point is that this article seven shirt was not shown
in the presence of panchas P W six and P W and seven
Seven yes my lord
You wanted to prove that article should be shown in the
presence of panchas 
 Panchas yes my lord
In the presence of panchas 
If if it is if it does show on then it is hit hit by
under one section sixty-two my lord 
If it is sealed earlier uhm then it should be
sealed should be opened opened in the presence of panchas 
and then only it can be shown
 Uhm 
Yes 
Well uh we now that that is one of if it is this shirt
now their case is there when this shirt was first taken under
charge of panchnama by the panch 
number two uh P W two 
And it is their case it was sealed if it is sealed if it
is so sealed the seal should be b br broken
 in the presence of panchas and uh and this
shirt should be shown in the pr shown to in in the presence of
 panchas 
That is that is one aspect 
I sugge after showing this shirt there there was no
sealing that is most important my lord 
Because this this shirt was shown to them there were no
sealing and subsequently sent to C A my lord 
After later days so many days 
That is one point 
My lord P W seven 
After showing this shirt uhm to P W uh six and
seven uh you normally your witness is one zero two
 Uhm 
 Uh 
Only two six two is
Apart from P W number six and seven it was not shown to the
others
No there there other panchas were there my
lord 
 One word 
No they they would be just
Article seven apart from a few words interruption
So only they want to they they established that the article
seven in connection with three my lord 
So with my respectful seven that the P W six or seven they
admitted possession before showing this shirt they have not given
description of article if it is not given description article and it
would not show in the in the pre if it sealed If
it is sealed it this seal was not br br broken 
 in their presence in so therefore we had doubt about this genuiness
about this prosecution
That is one aspect 
Now my lord whether further if I may take further evidence my
lord 
That if P W two is mo most 
important of the prosecution witness P W two Solid 
Now page nine my lord 
Page nine cross section para two 
Para two my lord 
My L i if when question was put when this article
seven is there any passivity mark man 
manufacturing mark manufacturing mark this I'll
 read my lord the fourth uh uh
Manufacturing mark of
Means there is need no label mark label mark this
shirt was there is some marking on this 
Trade mark
Trade marks so that I I trade mark trade tra
 if it is really taken under panchanama they might
pointed out before in the panchanama this is nino
 mark that it is not so mentioned in the panchanama 
This there is no reference of manufacturing label nino 
article seven in exhibit eight similar shirts shirts like this are freely
available in the market 
So this there is I now say panchanama was
explain 
Now my lord the there is one point so similar question
were put up P W six and seven whether there is any label or trade marks 
whether did you point out in panchanama uh or in your
statement or in panchanama they said nothing 
My lord now 
Now my lord P W two further says when this shirt was found on
the flooring it uh he further says the blood stains mark mark by police
with the pen 
The shirt was then sealed and packed and labeled 
So it is presumed that the return must have must have done at
that time in the premises my lord 
That is one aspect 
Yes
That is with uh why it is very important 
This is a an incidence of the 
panchanama on twenty-seventh July ninety-one
Yes 
That is there case it was sealed mark everything,
Now my lord if it so my lord then this when they are
searching at that time nobody was there only panchas 
were there uh shirt was taken sealed 
Now with this we we come to evidence of P W one most important
P W one 
Yes
Page two my lord from sixth line bottom 
Where 
Uh page two
What
Page two page number two examination chief 
Where that 
Well nineth line from bottom 
Nineth line from bottom 
Yes
Police visited the watchman room seize the bloods
 blood stained clothes from under the cot 
These clothes were brought up before the police officer these
clothes also packed which which were which were brought from the watchman
room 
If it is so if it is sealed how it is brought from the when
this incident happened in flat 
And this was shown to the this this part of panch
panch at uh scene of offence 
Once if it is sealed if it is sealed then how it is being
brought 
Yes
It disturbs it get disturbs and I may be I am not clear 
for the example my lord if this one packet here is sealed and if I
point to that opened it if it if it is not sealed it is
easily we may shown if it if it is if it is sealed it should be 
so so their connection in this P evidence of P W one and P W two sir
it is inconsistence evidence with regard to them 
With if it is sealed then how it is shown it was already
sealed that is that is one aspect
