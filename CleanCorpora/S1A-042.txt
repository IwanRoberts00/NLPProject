<I>
""
""
She also  what is it
""
""
I think both of you 
""
""
Pankaj in the north  uh what kind of a system of study do
you have 
""
Do you have state level of studies 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Like in Maharashtra  yeah yeah
 we all have three levels
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
State  level
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
And which you find the best 
""
""
I think uh 
""
""
Why 
""
""
Why 
""
""
Yeah  uh because the board
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
You  and IPSC
""
""
Ah
""
""
Uh which is  much competency you gain I think
""
""
You mean  students can't
follow it
""
""
""
""
""
No no 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  tough
""
""
Very tough for their age 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 the students are
uh trained in a better way by these two CBSE and IPSC systems 
""
""
You have studied through
""
""
Speak one by one
""
""
You have studied through 
""
""
State level 
""
""
State level
""
""
State 
""
""
""
""
""
But uh  I mean prefer the state level of studies
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But now that have you  or a
CBSE school 
""
""
You said you were teaching right somewhere
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Which school was that 
""
""
No no 
""
""
No but you have 
""
""
 school right
""
""
Oh yeah 
""
It is uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Where is it 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
No  I mean with Lucknow
""
""
Yeah in Lucknow 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
English medium 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah I taught
""
""
Uh
""
""
What did you teach there 
""
""
What subject 
""
""
Mostly if uh  and
mathematics
""
""
""
""
""
Uh that means you taught one subject  in
which level 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh right start from  uh eighth standard
""
""
Eighth to the tenth
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Did you taught these two subjects
""
""
Yes
""
""
And what uh 
""
""
School 
""
""
No that school belonged to CBSE IPSC or state level school 
""
""
I did CBSE 
""
""
CBSE 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And what subject were you teaching  out of the science
subjects 
""
""
Not nothing 
""
""
Ah you said this
""
""
Out of science  I
teach nothing 
""
""
But you said just now  under which which
level did you like CBSE level or uh the state level 
""
""
State level
""
""
You like the state level  why not the CBSE
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Why not the CBSE level
""
""
See whatever I want  but in
CBSE level 
""
""
Limited course
""
""
Limited
""
""
Yeah only a limit is there 
""
""
No 
curriculam of studies is higher  always
""
""
""
""
""
""
 wide enough
 not limited
""
""
Just think about it 
""
""
Okay now uh 
""
""
State level
""
""
State level  Maharashtra Board
""
""
Then  but which do you
prefer
""
""
I prefer IPSC 
""
""
IPSC level  why
""
""
""
""
""
Because like whichever subject you study you get enough 
study about that subject 
""
Suppose after your  you leave your tenth standard and you go
outside somebody 
""
You select some  history uh
""
""
But in uh  when you are in IPSC school you get enough knowledge
about history 
""
So even though you don't study after you  leave the tenth
standard leave these subject  you know something about this
""
""
Yeah you can
""
""
When you study in SSC  you get a very limited knowledge
about that
""
While in the IPSC history you can get more about the monuments 
or more about 
whatever history is about
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  agree with it
""
""
We do  state level
book  see
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah I saw that uh
""
""
Every state level
""
""
Every state 
""
""
 in Maharashtra
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Whatever be the admission level I don't know  uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
Where 
""
""
Here 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In Maharashtra
""
""
Then 
""
""
 trying
to say
""
""
So we prefer the IPSC 
state level
""
""
""
""
""
You must 
""
""
Here you can say that IPSC is uh better  IPSC is better
""
""
But uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
State level is higher
""
""
Yeah  state level is higher
""
""
Yeah and we see these competitive examinations also that like
the  are most shine out
""
""
Shine out 
""
""
May be it is because that uh  syllabus is much better
oriented  we
have a great difficulty in uh  I mean scoring through these competitive
exams 
""
We always have to study little extra whereas you all  you can
get through 
""
But uh what we have both of us I and Priya but  still I found
out that  I can teach much better in
the IPSC level because I find it is a much better system
""
 uh well explained system for the students
level
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Now in the Maharashtra system 
so what is happened is  most of the Maharashtrians are rural background
 uh bring it
down to the level of 
""
""
 yeah
""
""
And that way to put it in extremely simple language but  I
find that there is a total confusion in the way the subjects are explained
out 
""
There is no  indepth knowledge given about any particular
subject
""
""
And
""
""
Like if the 
we find that that knowledge is not
""
""
Too less  to less for him
""
""
For him to proceed for higher 
""
So both of us Daisy and me have found out that  this system is
a much better systen  as compared to our Maharashtra Board level
""
""
Yeah Maharashtra
""
""
But Pankaj you
""
""
Yeah Maharashtra Board
""
""
Pankaj you have uh some different views 
""
Can you tell 
""
Okay Daisy 
""
""
Can you compare it with your uh  I mean the state level what
""
""
What way you found it different 
""
""
""
""
""
Now  see
""
If it is  see like the state level
""
""
You will have  now say if you want to study some industrial
procedure 
uhm 
""
Uh  type
of 
""
How much time it causes you 
""
What are the reactions you  what are the precautions to be
taken
""
You have  in the IPSC type
than in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Isn't than whatever you study say  in
the ninth standard  you have more
knowledge  than in the
""
""
""
""
""
SSC school
""
""
SSC school  uh behind
""
""
The state level
""
""
One step behind  uh one step behind than the IPSC school
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Do you find that uh  uh they say the
Maharashtra government says that the books have purposely been  brought
down to this level because the student then understand English 
""
Now if you make the system so much easy for the students that they
will  as
well as not getting down to the English knowledge 
""
Don't you think it is so
""
""
Yeah it is 
""
""
That  we don't even get enough knowledge
""
""
Yeah of course  said no
""
See if it is  he will find
the study more boring 
""
""
""
who come to the IPSC school
""
""
IPSC schools are not that good 
""
I mean 
""
But when they  study that course they will prove more
brilliant than those  state level
""
""
That is how 
""
""
That is because they get more knowledge 
""
""
Yeah right 
""
""
Though they don't understand  make an effort
because they have to study
""
""
They have to study
""
""
While those at  they are
satisfied with whatever they get 
""
And what they do is they only  do the work of mostly by
hearting 
""
""
Right
""
""
Uhn 
to understand the topic 
""
""
""
""
""
Like  they
have only the questions which are from behind the book
""
""
Yeah right
""
""
Well our IPSC schools have  all through out the topic
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
And understanding is expected in 
""
""
 is expected
""
""
Also the practical is  like we
start right from the eighth  standard for the practical
knowledge and all  so that helps the students
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And also it is seen that uh  of the IPSC
level  when you go out to State Board junior college level
""
""
Yeah
""
""
They always  better
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah and they get  better percentage
""
""
And uh they have uh a 
""
""
 that uh whatever I saw the
education level here in English medilum no
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
The same education level is in  in Hindi
medium
""
""
In Hindi
""
""
So  talking about
""
""
Yeah in the state level 
""
And there IPSC and CBSE is there 
""
""
No  this IPSC is equivalent to
 in study
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not more state level 
but I find that children here that uh  students
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
These are like them 
""
""
 your state
level students are as equivalent to the IPSC 
students here
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No that 
""
""
Do you say that  uh because you all are studying in the
Hindi medium 
""
""
 in your
home language 
""
The  after all English is some
""
""
""
""
""
No why not in  why
not in the state level Maharashtra 
""
""
""
""
""
No we don't study in Marathi
""
""
In Marathi Marathi medium
""
""
We don't study
""
""
We won't be able to give you a better idea
""
""
No no no 
""
Why not 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Yes
""
""
They also can teach  Marathi also
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Yes 
""
""
No what 
""
""
See  the matter that is given out to the students
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Whether you are studying it in Marathi  whether you are
studying it in English  as compared to the IPSC
level students 
""
""
You know the course is more wider  not
limited in IPSC and CBSE
""
""
And it is also observed that IPSC students  or CBSE
student shine much better in competitive exams 
""
I 
do shine in  that exams
""
""
""
