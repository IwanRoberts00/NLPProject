<I>
She also what is it
I think both of you laughter 
Pankaj in the north uh what kind of a system of study do
you have 
Do you have state level of studies 
Yeah 
Like in Maharashtra we've got uh yeah yeah
 more important we all have three levels
 Yeah yeah 
Yes
State CBSE and IPSC level
 IPSC 
Yes
And which you find the best 
I think uh easy board is state level one word 
Why 
Why 
Yeah uh because the board
Uhn 
You you've been a CBSE and IPSC
Ah
Uh which is much competency you gain I think
You mean it's very tough students can't
follow it
 It's very tough 
No no students can follow 
 It's very tough 
Yeah it's tough
Very tough for their age 
 It's tough one or two words 
 But don't you think that uh the students are
uh trained in a better way by these two CBSE and IPSC systems 
You have studied through
Speak one by one
You have studied through 
State level 
State level
State yes level studies 
 Yes 
But uh I mean prefer the state level of studies
Yeah 
But now that have you taught in any IPSC school or a
CBSE school 
You said you were teaching right somewhere
Yeah 
Which school was that 
No no it's not computer 
No but you have taught na 
 Taught in some school right
Oh yeah 
It is uh Mariam Convent School 
 Mariam Convent School 
Yeah
Where is it 
Uh it's near by my house 
No I mean with Lucknow
Yeah in Lucknow 
 It's an English medium school 
Yeah 
English medium yeah and you taught 
 Yeah 
Yeah I taught
Uh
What did you teach there 
What subject 
Mostly if uh that science physical and
mathematics
 Physical 
Uh that means you taught one subject yeah in
which level 
 Yeah 
Uh right start from uh eighth standard
Eighth to the tenth
Yeah
Did you taught these two subjects
Yes
And what uh state or IPSC or CBSE what level was it 
School 
No that school belonged to CBSE IPSC or state level school 
I did CBSE 
CBSE 
Yeah
And what subject were you teaching out of the science
subjects 
Not nothing 
Ah you said this
Out of science uh out of science and mathematics I
teach nothing 
But you said just now CBSE level under which which
level did you like CBSE level or uh the state level 
State level
You like the state level yeah why not the CBSE
 Yeah 
Uh 
Why not the CBSE level
See whatever I want I can get in state level but in
CBSE level there is limited course 
Limited course
Limited
Yeah only a limit is there 
No but in the CBSE or the IPSC uh the 
curriculam of studies is higher than the state level always
 No 
 And the course also is uh wide enough
 not limited
Just think about it whole thing 
Okay now uh Daisy what level have you studied in 
State level
State level that is the Maharashtra Board
Then now you are teaching in a IPSC level but which do you
prefer
I prefer IPSC 
IPSC level yeah why
 Yeah 
Because like whichever subject you study you get enough 
study about that subject 
Suppose after your you leave your tenth standard and you go
outside somebody 
You select some uh different side like science history uh
 arts commerce 
But in uh when you are in IPSC school you get enough knowledge
about history enough knowledge about Geography 
So even though you don't study after you leave the tenth
standard leave these subject you know something about this
Yeah you can
When you study in SSC you get a very limited knowledge
about that
While in the IPSC history you can get more about the monuments 
or more about whatever the caves or see you see 
whatever history is about
 You see 
Uh I don't uh I don't agree with it
We do you not know about your state level
book our state level books are like see
 No because because 
Yeah I saw that uh
Every state level
Every state has their own sort of uh 
 Yeah I saw that uh that uh in Maharashtra
Uhn 
Whatever be the admission level I don't know uhm
 but I find that education level is low 
 Uhm 
Where 
Here 
 In Maharashtra 
 In Maharashtra 
In Maharashtra
Then that is what we are saying 
 That's what we both are saying trying
to say
So we prefer the IPSC more than the see 
state level
 See 
You must one word 
Here you can say that IPSC is uh better IPSC is better
 yeah you can say 
But uh there U P for state level in U P 
 uhm compe 
 Yeah 
 U P 
 Uhm 
State level is higher
Yeah state level is higher
Yeah and we see these competitive examinations also that like
the they have the students from the UP level are most shine out
Shine out one word 
May be it is because that uh syllabus is much better
oriented as but uh when we Maharashtra students when we go outside we
have a great difficulty in uh I mean scoring through these competitive
exams 
We always have to study little extra whereas you all you can
get through straigh uh straight away 
But uh what we have both of us I and Priya but still I found
out that after studying the state level I can teach much better in
the IPSC level because I find it is a much better system
 It's a very uh well explained system for the students
level
Yeah
Now in the Maharashtra system Maharashtra State Board 
so what is happened is most of the Maharashtrians are rural background
 uh students and the Education Board has tried to uh bring it
down to the level of rural level 
 A few words yeah
And that way to put it in extremely simple language but I
find that there is a total confusion in the way the subjects are explained
out 
There is no indepth knowledge given about any particular
subject
And
Like if the person is from a higher background like 
we find that that knowledge is not
Too less to less for him
For him to proceed for higher higher studies 
So both of us Daisy and me have found out that this system is
a much better systen as compared to our Maharashtra Board level
Yeah Maharashtra
But Pankaj you
Yeah Maharashtra Board
Pankaj you have uh some different views 
Can you tell like any taking 
Okay Daisy uh like uh about your subject chemistry 
 uhm 
Can you compare it with your uh I mean the state level what
 you've studied and now you are teaching in the IPSC level 
What way you found it different 
 Uhm 
Now let's see
If it is chemistry and SSC level see like the state level
You will have now say if you want to study some industrial
procedure you'll not have the detail study 
uhm see it'll just be an outline study uhm 
Uh while in chemis uh in the IPSC type
of you'll have the whole process 
How much time it causes you 
What are the reactions you what are the precautions to be
taken
You have more point IPSC in the IPSC type
than in the SSC type 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 IPSC 
 Yeah 
Isn't than whatever you study say uh you're in
the ninth standard yeah say you know more you have more
knowledge in IPSC school than in the
 Yeah 
SSC school
SSC school like they are one more uh behind
The state level
One step behind uh one step behind than the IPSC school
Yes 
Do you find that uh I mean uh they say the
Maharashtra government says that the books have purposely been brought
down to this level because the student then understand English 
Now if you make the system so much easy for the students that they
will in in a way that they are hampering their own uh knowledge as
well as not getting down to the English knowledge 
Don't you think it is so
Yeah it is 
That we don't even get enough knowledge
Yeah of course that's what I've said no
See if it is a student who is more brilliant he will find
the study more boring and the 
 How do you find the level of students 
who come to the IPSC school
IPSC schools are not that good you see 
I mean uh they are also like all the other normal schools 
But when they study that course they will prove more
brilliant than those state level
That is how 
That is because they get more knowledge 
Yeah right 
Though they don't understand they'll make an effort
because they have to study
They have to study
While those at uh state level students they are
satisfied with whatever they get 
And what they do is they only do the work of mostly by
hearting 
Right
Uhn they don't uh like they don't want 
to understand the topic 
 Understand 
Like if they are now the exams if you consider they
have only the questions which are from behind the book
Yeah right
Well our IPSC schools have all through out the topic
Yes they cover up the whole topic 
 Cover up the whole topic 
And understanding is expected in the school 
 Yeah Understanding is expected
Also the practical is very nicely like we
start right from the eighth yes standard for the practical
knowledge and all so that helps the students
 Yeah yeah 
 Yes 
Yeah 
And also it is seen that uh our students of the IPSC
level when you go out to State Board junior college level
Yeah
They always shine out better
 Shine out 
Yeah and they get better percentage
And uh they have uh a better application 
 Whatever I saw that uh whatever I saw the
education level here in English medilum no
Yeah 
The same education level is in uh UP Board in Hindi
medium
In Hindi
So you're talking about
Yeah in the state level 
And there IPSC and CBSE is there for there 
No you see this IPSC is equivalent to
 your state level in study
 You see 
 Your state level 
Not more state level but it is less it is less 
but I find that children here that uh students
 Ha 
 Ha 
These are like them like state level 
 Accha are you saying your state
level students are as equivalent to the IPSC IP 
students here
 Your state level students 
 IP 
No that uh yeah 
Do you say that uh because you all are studying in the
Hindi medium it is the better way the student can understand 
 Can understand because if it is in your
home language no they can grasp it more better 
The Eng after all English is some
 And even grasp 
No why not in uh Maharashtra Maharashtra why
not in the state level Maharashtra 
 Some foreign language 
No we don't study in Marathi
In Marathi Marathi medium
We don't study
We won't be able to give you a better idea
No no no 
Why not some person have uh studied in uh Marathi also 
Yes 
Uhn
Yes
They also can teach in Marathi also
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Yes 
Uhm
Yes 
No what I'm saying is 
See the matter that is given out to the students
Uhm 
Whether you are studying it in Marathi whether you are
studying it in English is extremely less as compared to the IPSC
level students 
You know the course is more wider it's not
limited in IPSC and CBSE
And it is also observed that IPSC students or CBSE
student shine much better in competitive exams 
I and it is also observed that UP Board students 
do shine in that exams
 Do shine
