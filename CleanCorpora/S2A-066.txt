Your honour this is a case where earlier the section was
applied was three nought seven 
But later on as the as the deceased as the pa as
the patient was uh succumbed to death it was altered into
three nought two IPC Your Honour
 No 
Three nought seven to three nought
Yes three nought two 
Yes
Five P W's were examined by the prosecution 
Five prosecution witnesses were examined by the prosecution 
But uh there is no eye witness in the whole case unh 
whole case rested upon the circumstantial evidence and three dying
declarations 
As far as Your Your Honour dying declaration by the S C M
is concerned the the first dying declaration recorded by P W number one
S C M is concerned there is no any endorsement of the Doctor to
the effect that the patient was in a fit uh fit there was no
endorsement that the patient was uh despondent is in a fit state to
make a declaration 
Then
Then as such it wishes it wishes the
whole dying declaration 
And then
Ans as such it wishes it wishes the
whole dying declaration 
Because there is no endorsement of the Doctor to the effect 
that patient was conscious and was in a free state of mind
What number
But uh inspite of the fact that uh no endorsement of
the doctor was obtained in evidence of P W number five on page uh
Your honour as far as P W number three is concerned he is a
Doctor who has uh he who has uh performed the post mortem Your Honour
And what is relevant is at the time of the
 One word 
Yes Your Honour it is very much necessary because as far
as the Doctor's endorsement is concerned Your Honour it is
relevant because at the time when the declaration was made whether the
patient or the despondent was in a condition to condition to depose 
is very much material
But the Doctor is there 
 And and and and this this 
 When the doctor is present before them
Yes Your Honour
And uh in this case apart from whether the con patient
was in a condition to talk is not sufficient what is sufficient is the mental
act as well Your Honour 
A patient uh if it is a an incident
as alleged by the prosecution then a patient can be under the mental
shock 
Yes proceed
And maybe due to one reason or the other his uh 
reasoning capacity may be affected 
She may not be able to understand the questions which were put to
her 
The 
Yes
And uh here Your Honour it is a clear case that uh it
is she herself it is not the case that I had uh gone and I had read
the message
But I fully aware Your Honour that it is a superficial when
injury everything is there and Your Honour when uh even the I O also
here says that uh Doctor was very much present 
Even the evidence of P W number four was also there that he was
very much present at the time 
Who ?
Your honour I am relying upon the evidence of uh P W number
five upon two 
Here he has said this since the Doctor was very much present 
while the complaint was being recorded 
Your Honour I am on a on the point that when the
 pa condition of the patient was not serious as alleged by the
prosecution 
As far as Your Honour condition uh whether he is in a condition to
make a statement or not
That of course
Honour my honest submission is this that the
Make it clear 
P W seven Doctor Ram who has first treated this
patient immediately after the patient was brought to the hospital has
deposed in words that she was a con in a condition
 to speak 
Your honour my question was that whether at the time of
admission he was in a condition to talk or not 
I am not on that point Your Honour
Doctor Miss Maya 
Your Honour but I am not on that point Your Honour
I am not uh challenging the qualification of a Doctor Your
Honour I am also admitting that she is M S but I am only on the point
Your Honour whether the time when the deposition was made it 
Doctor's endorsement was necessary to that effect and because 
doctor's endorsement is not there Your Honour a reasonable doubt can
be there Your Honour that he is not uh he may not be in a condition or
uh or in a mental state to depose what she has deposed 
Yes 
See the next point 
Yes Your Honour 
My next point is in this incident Your Honour as far as uh 
kerosene uh prosecution is silent as to from where the complainant
or I'd say deceased has procured kerosene oil 
Different versions are before the honourable court 
According to F I R Your Honour F I R is silent on this point
As far as Panchanama is concerned exhibit
eighteen that a plastic bottle was containing kerosene uh kerosene oil
As far as evidence of P W number three uh two is concerned
mother of the de deceased but uh 
Number over six before the judge she has removed the
Yes it is exhibit 
Yes Your Honour but as far as the evidence of P W number
two is concerned Your Honour P W number two says that uh yeah I
am on page uh two upon two Your Honour that uh in anger she
poured kerosene on her person from a lamp 
And uh when I asked the same question in cross examination the
uh witness says I didn't state in my statement before the police that my
 daughter Binaka poured kerosene from a lamp on her person 
witness volunteered the lamp was made of a glass bottle 
Then what is there 
That lamp was made of a glass bottle 
That means she poured herse uh that means the deceased
had poured kerosene oil uh from the bot uh bot glass
bottle made uh lamp made of a glass bottle
Yes 
And uh if that is so then there is a 
contrad contradiction between the two that
whether it is from the plastic bottle that she has poured the kerosene oil or
from the lamp 
 As a fact what type of the bottle 
It is from the lamp or from that plastic bottle
Exactly Your Honour but as far as the duty of the
investigation officer is concerned Your Honour it is the duty to find out
that exactly from where it was procured Your Honour 
Yes 
Thirdly Your Honour uh as far as
Keep the rest free
Yes Your Honour 
Thirdly Your Honour I I would uh like to submit that as far as
the clothes under sealed the article under panchanama 
is concerned Your Honour I am on that point 
Over this
Yes this point is over
The kerosene is uh
Yes
Bottle or a lamp
So yes Your Honour 
Article four article four before the court 
Yes
Now Your Honour my next point is regarding 
My next point is regarding the seizure of article
 What's that 
Seizure of article
Article 
Yes 
Now Your Honour in this case if we believe the
prosecution case where there was a burn injury on the chest portion
 from front
Chest to abdomen
Chest to abdomen 
Then in that case the blouse which was produced by the uh
under panchanama seized in a seized and produce under
 panchanama Your Honour that should be in burnt condition
But here it is in torn condition Your Honour
Uh now this uh 
Now Your Honour in this case the only thing which I
would like to say that now Your Honour as far as uh on
this point Your Honour only thing I would like to submit that uh in
forwarding letter in forwarding letter the officer has stated 
certain queries in that queries Your Honour the first question was
that whether the exhibit one two three contains any kerosene 
And clear report to that effect is that on exhibit
one two and three are positive 
But no where Your Honour in clear report it is mentioned as a 
blouse wa blouse was in burnt condition Your Honour 
Oh
Yes Your Honour
And the a few words 
Yes Your Honour to have a kerosene on the article 
and and Your Honour when the kerosene is sprinkled on the article uh
like a blouse or any cloth material Your Honour then there is
likelihood that uh it will burn Your Honour even it will not be in
 this position
Secondly Your Honour I am on the point as far as uh cap 
 it nowhere the witness or the in F I R neither in the 
At the scene of
Dying declaration Your Honour it is stated that it is
sprinkled Your Honour there is difference between sprinkling and pouring
Your Honour 
Here it is poured Your Honour
But the 
Yes Your Honour but I am confining myself on the day of
incident Your Honour 
As far as on the day of incident is concerned Your Honour
Yes
Different version is versions are 
there in the F I R and in the uh dying declaration Your Honour
Yes 
As far as F I R is concerned Your Honour sh
 she has stated that today that means on eleven
nine ninety-two at about three pm my husband Mahesh assaulted me
 as I didn't go to collect scrap and further picked up quarrel with me
 at about four pm that thing 
There is a time gap of one hour 
It means assaulting and between the quarrel 
That means uh assaulted and picked up quarrel with me at
three p m and at about four pm I poured kerosene on my own person
Ah 
At about four pm I poured kerosene on my own person
So
So within
Article seizure of article seizure of
Very well Your Honour I will first confine myself to seizure
of article Your Honour 
As far as Your Honour seizure of article is concerned I will
uh humbly submit that as far as uh this uh blouse piece is concerned
 and if Your Honour will notice then I don't know whether uh
 yes I think this is the first front portion 
This is the front portion of the blouse Your Honour 
And as per medical evidence Your Honour there was a
 injury burn injury 
I will say major burn injury on chest and abdomen Your
Honour 
In that case Your Honour this blouse would not be have
been intact Your Honour 
This is intact because if your honour will see
Ah this 
If Your Honour will see the uh patti 
Your Honour
Ha
Then it means this is a complete blouse 
The only thing somebody has cut if Your Honour say that
it may have cut uh by the C A uhm
It is taken by the C A
Yes that's Your Honour 
Your honour my only submission is that looking into the condition
of the bl this piece of cloth blouse Your Honour it is a
full uh it is a complete one only it is in torn condition but
not in burnt condition
It is not torn here it is burnt 
Your Honour but uh then I will submit that looking into the
uh medical uh me me medical 
evidence Your Honour 
I will say that uh this is not a the 
same blouse which could have been worn by the complainant on that
day your honour 
This is on that day 
Yes 
And uh same is my argument as far as two sarees
 are concerned Your Honour two sarees have been
produced but
 Sarees 
No Your Honour I am not on that point your honour 
I am on different point now 
As far as this is concerned I say it is not uh burnt but
it is only in torn condition 
But as far as this uh these two sarees are
concerned Your Honour my submission is that that a person cannot
wear two sarees at a at one time 
And practically it is not possible to wear two sarees
 uh on the time of alleged incident Your Honour 
Therefore
So 
It was one word 
Blanket
Blanket a few words 
Your honour if that is case then the prosecution has not
brought on the record that uh why the two sarees 
were used
No no maybe
Sir there is as I stated that there is no eye
witness in this case
Yes
Therefore I cannot say whether this saree 
was worn by that victim only thing is that whatever the officers
found there has been taken charge under the panchanama 
But looking at the burnt saree it appears to be
the saree which was worn by the 
Her
Victim 
And obviously that because we have to see the 
circumstances that strata from which this community comes 
And 
So
Strata society from which they are coming I know
poverty 
Yes Your Honour I fully agree
They come from different strata you have to explain that 
to her two words blanket 
No Your Honour I am not expecting Your Honour 
But my only humble submi 
 A few words 
Yes Your Honour 
And uh for that reason only Your Honour nowhere in the F I R
nowhere in the evidence of the P W or the dying declaration Your
Honour it has some 
 A few words if the articles are there the
police have seized not uh
Yes Your Honour 
Yes Your Honour exactly this
Then why it is not the circumstance
Exactly the same thing Your Honour
I want to submit that circumstances may not lie Your Honour 
because two sarees are there why two sarees 
are there Your Honour 
 A few words 
Your Honour in that uh in that way I will submit
About say
Your honour in F I R one gontat was there
Do you agree statement
Fully agree Your Honour and for that reason Your Honour I am
submitting that uh because two sarees are there in
F I R as well as in uh 
 One word 
Yes
 A few words 
No Your Honour as far as gontat is
concerned because in F I R it is clearly mentioned that the
 accused has tried to extinguish the fire by uh throwing a gunny bag
or gontat on the burning person and therby he has tried
to extinguish the fire and from where this saree has
come Your Honour 
 One word
