Your honour this is a case  where earlier the section was
applied was three nought seven 
""
But later on as the  as
the patient  it was altered into
three nought two  Your Honour
""
""
""
""
""
Three nought seven to three nought
""
""
Yes three nought two 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Five 
""
Five prosecution witnesses were examined by the prosecution 
""
But uh 
whole case rested upon the circumstantial evidence  and three dying
declarations 
""
As far as  Your Honour dying declaration by the S C M
is concerned  the the first dying declaration recorded by P W number one
S C M  to
the effect  fit uh fit there was no
endorsement that the patient was uh  to
make a declaration 
""
""
Then
""
""
Then as such it  the
whole dying declaration 
""
""
And then
""
""
Ans as such it  the
whole dying declaration 
""
Because there is no endorsement of the Doctor to the effect 
that  patient was conscious and was in a free state of mind
""
""
What number
""
""
But uh  no endorsement of
the doctor was obtained  on page uh
""
""
Your honour  P W number three is concerned he is a
Doctor who has uh  he who has uh performed the post mortem Your Honour
""
And  what is relevant is at the time of the
""
""
""
""
""
Yes Your Honour it is very much necessary because  as far
as the  it is
relevant because at the time  when the declaration was made whether the
patient or the despondent was in a condition to 
is very much material
""
""
But the Doctor is 
""
""
""
""
""
 is present before them
""
""
Yes Your Honour
""
And uh in this case  patient
was in a condition to talk is not sufficient what is sufficient is the mental
act as well Your Honour 
""
A patient uh  incident
as alleged by the prosecution  then a patient can be under the mental
shock 
""
""
Yes proceed
""
""
And 
reasoning capacity 
""
She may not be able to understand the questions which were put to
her 
""
The 
""
""
Yes
""
""
And uh here Your Honour  it
is she herself  gone and I had read
the message
""
But  I fully aware Your Honour that it is a superficial when
injury everything is there  I O also
here says that uh 
""
Even the evidence of P W number four was also there that he was
very much present at the time 
""
""
Who  ?
""
""
Your honour I am relying upon the evidence of uh P W number
five upon two 
""
Here he has said this since the Doctor was very much present 
while the complaint was being recorded 
""
Your Honour  on the point that when the
 condition of the patient was not serious as alleged by the
prosecution 
""
As far as Your Honour condition uh whether he is in a condition to
make a statement or not
""
""
That of course
""
""
Honour  my honest submission is this that the
""
""
Make it clear 
""
""
P W seven Doctor  who has first treated this
patient  immediately after the patient was brought to the hospital has
deposed in words that she was  in a condition
""
""
""
Your honour my question was that whether at the time of
admission he was in a condition to talk or not 
""
I am not on that point Your Honour
""
""
Doctor Miss 
""
""
Your Honour but I am not on that point Your Honour
""
I am not uh  challenging the qualification of a Doctor Your
Honour I am also admitting that she is M S  but I am only on the point
Your Honour whether the time when the deposition was made 
Doctor's 
doctor's  a reasonable doubt can
be there Your Honour that he is not uh  he may not be in a condition or
uh 
""
""
Yes 
""
See the next point 
""
""
Yes Your Honour 
""
My next point is 
kerosene uh  complainant
or 
""
Different versions are before the honourable court 
""
According to F I R Your Honour  F I R is silent on this point
""
""
As far as  exhibit
eighteen  that a plastic bottle was containing kerosene uh kerosene oil
""
""
As far as evidence of P W number three  uh two is concerned
mother of the 
""
""
Number over six before the judge she has removed the
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Yes Your Honour  but as far as the evidence of P W number
two is concerned Your Honour  yeah I
am on page uh  in anger she
poured kerosene on her person from a lamp 
""
And uh when I asked the same question in cross examination  the
uh  witness says I didn't state in my statement before the police that my
""
witness volunteered the lamp was made of a glass bottle 
""
""
Then what is there 
""
""
That lamp was made of a glass bottle 
""
That means she poured  deceased
had poured kerosene oil  glass
bottle made uh  lamp made of a glass bottle
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And uh 
contrad  that
whether it is from the plastic bottle that she has poured the kerosene oil or
from the 
""
""
""
""
It is from the lamp or from that plastic bottle
""
""
Exactly Your Honour but as far as the duty of the
investigation officer is concerned Your Honour  it is the duty to find out
that exactly from where it was procured Your Honour 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Thirdly Your Honour uh as far as
""
""
Keep the rest free
""
""
Yes Your Honour 
""
Thirdly Your Honour I  I would uh like to submit that as far as
the clothes 
is concerned Your Honour 
""
""
Over this
""
""
Yes this point is over
""
""
The kerosene is uh
""
""
Yes
""
""
Bottle or a lamp
""
""
So 
""
""
Article 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Now Your Honour my next point is 
""
My next point is regarding the seizure of article
""
""
""
""
""
Seizure of article
""
""
Article 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Now Your Honour in this case  if we believe the
prosecution case  on the chest portion
 from front
""
""
Chest to abdomen
""
""
Chest to abdomen 
""
Then in that case the blouse which was produced  uh
under  seized and produce under
 that should be in burnt condition
""
""
But here it is in torn condition Your Honour
""
""
Uh now this uh 
""
""
Now Your Honour  the only thing which I
would like to say  on
this point Your Honour only thing I would like to submit  in
forwarding letter 
certain queries  the first question was
that whether the exhibit one two three contains any kerosene 
""
And  on exhibit
one two and three are positive 
""
But no where Your Honour in clear report it is mentioned as a 
blouse 
""
""
Oh
""
""
Yes Your Honour
""
""
And 
""
""
Yes Your Honour to have a kerosene on the 
and  when the kerosene is sprinkled on the article uh
like a blouse  then there is
likelihood that uh  even it will not be in
 this position
""
Secondly Your Honour I am on the point as far as uh 
""
""
""
At the scene of
""
""
Dying declaration Your Honour  it is stated that it is
sprinkled Your Honour  there is difference between sprinkling and pouring
Your Honour 
""
Here it is poured Your Honour
""
""
But the 
""
""
Yes Your Honour but I am confining myself on the day of
incident Your Honour 
""
As far as on the day of incident is concerned Your Honour
""
""
Yes
""
""
Different 
there in the F I R and in the  uh dying declaration Your Honour
""
""
Yes 
""
""
As far as F I R is concerned Your Honour  sh
 today that means on eleven
nine ninety-two at about three pm my husband  assaulted me
 as I didn't go to collect scrap and further picked up quarrel with me
""
""
There is a time gap of one hour 
""
It means assaulting 
""
That means  uh assaulted and picked up quarrel with me at
three p m  at about four pm I poured kerosene on my own person
""
""
Ah 
""
""
At about four pm  on my own person
""
""
""
So
""
""
So within
""
""
Article seizure of article  seizure of
""
""
Very well Your Honour I will first confine myself to seizure
of article Your Honour 
""
As far as Your Honour seizure of article is concerned  I will
uh  blouse piece is concerned
 I don't know whether uh
""
""
This is the front portion of the blouse Your Honour 
""
And  a
""
""
I will say  on chest and abdomen Your
Honour 
""
In that case Your Honour this blouse would not  have
been intact Your Honour 
""
This is intact because if your honour will see
""
""
Ah 
""
""
If Your Honour will see the uh 
Your Honour
""
""
Ha
""
""
Then it means this is a complete blouse 
""
The only thing  if Your Honour say that
it may have cut uh  uhm
""
""
It is taken by the C A
""
""
Yes 
""
Your honour my only submission is that looking into the condition
of the  Your Honour it is a
full uh  but
not in burnt condition
""
""
It is not torn 
""
""
Your Honour but uh then I will submit that looking into the
uh 
evidence Your Honour 
""
I will say that uh this is not 
same  which could have been worn by the complainant on that
day your honour 
""
This is on that day 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And uh same is my argument as far as two  sarees
 have been
produced  but
""
""
""
""
""
No Your Honour 
""
I am on different point now 
""
As far as this is concerned I say it is not uh  but
it is only in torn condition 
""
But as far as this  are
concerned Your Honour  cannot
wear two 
""
And practically it is not possible  sarees
""
""
""
Therefore
""
""
So 
""
""
It was 
""
""
Blanket
""
""
Blanket 
""
""
Your honour if that is case then the prosecution has not
brought on the record 
were used
""
""
No no maybe
""
""
Sir  as I stated that there is no eye
witness in this case
""
""
Yes
""
""
Therefore I cannot say whether this 
was worn by that  only thing is that whatever the officers
found there 
""
""
But looking at the burnt  it appears to be
the 
""
""
Her
""
""
Victim 
""
And obviously 
circumstances that strata from which this community comes 
""
""
And 
""
""
So
""
""
Strata society from which they are coming  I know
poverty 
""
""
Yes Your Honour I fully agree
""
""
They come from different strata you have to explain that 
to her 
""
""
No Your Honour I am not expecting Your Honour 
""
But my only humble 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes Your Honour 
""
And uh  for that reason only Your Honour nowhere in the F I R
nowhere in the  or the dying declaration Your
Honour it has some 
""
""
 if the articles are there the
police have seized not uh
""
""
Yes Your Honour 
""
Yes Your Honour  exactly this
""
""
Then why it is not the circumstance
""
""
Exactly the same thing Your Honour
""
I want to submit that circumstances may not lie Your Honour 
because two 
are there Your Honour 
""
""
""
""
""
Your Honour  in that way I will submit
""
""
About say
""
""
Your honour in F I R one  was there
""
""
Do you agree statement
""
""
Fully agree Your Honour and for that reason Your Honour I am
submitting  in
F I R as well as in uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
""
No Your Honour  is
concerned  in F I R it is clearly mentioned that the
 by uh throwing a gunny bag
or  on the burning person and therby he has tried
to extinguish the fire  has
come Your Honour 
""
""
""
