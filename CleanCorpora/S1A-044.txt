And how is your aunty who got married uh in the

Uh okay
Where is she staying 
Mangalore 
Mangalore only
Yeah 
Is she doing something there 
No just a house-wife 
 House-wife so that's it 
Aunty you do craft 
No not craft as such I do stitching work
All these you did it
No these things have been done my father-in-law
Oh 
He is a great artist 
You don't know anything about craft aunty 
Craft I don't know much 
Because I wanted to learn something uh which you know 
I know stitching I do uhm stitching of clothes 
So if you are interested in that I can teach you
Basic what's the basic in stitching aunty
First what should we learn like anything 
You should start from the smaller clothes 
Uhm that's the easiest way 
And the clothes in which uh there is not much of cutting 
because cutting the things is uh very important 
If you cut them nicely naturally the stitching will be nice
The dress will come out nicely 
So you should choose the clothes which are uh easy to cut
So first you should choose the smaller one like dress of a
baby which is easier 
And then only you can graduate to uh complicated dresses 
And I think that uh saree blouse is 
most complicated thing 
Oh laughter 
And uh how do you pass time like only stitching aunty you don't
have any other uh no passtime like
 No 
Household work is there stitching is there 
 Hobby what's your hobby 
Stitching and teaching laughter 
I have heard that you have that stitching with the like 
like electric current you use current for stitching yeah 
how how is it 
 Yeah 
 There's a small motor 
Uh it is attatched to the machine itself 
And with the help of a belt that uh wheel of the machine
the balance wheel of the machine that rotates with the help of that motor
So whenever the current is there we can use this 
But in Bangalore it's just 
 You can take it out when there is no current
and you can use it like that
Yeah yeah yeah 
 It's easy to take out 
Just that belt has to be removed 
And when that belt is removed you can just put on that uh other
belt which is used for the paddle style running 
Like for ordinary machine only you have attatched the mo
 motor 
Yes oh it's ordinary machine
Earlier it I was using it on pedestal only 
But uh after three four years I attached the motor to it
So I can use it both way 
There is no difficulty in using it 
And whenever current is there it becomes very easy
 Oh 
Yeah because 
Using it on the pedestal puts a lot of pressure on uh
feet 
Do you want to learn stitching 
Yes but I am very interested but uh how
Yeah at present you won't be able
At present I won't be able but next year after my exams I
think I want to learn stitching laughter so I was 
And then craft uh 
Yeah craft I was taught many things in school 
But now we don't have yeah Sapna my younger sister she
is interested and she does all things 
But uh in T V I can't adjust with them and I can learn things
from because
I wanted uhm 
No I want to do it with them like they are too fast 
 oh I can't keep it everything in my 
 Oh 
 Yeah they keep everything half ready
 yeah and then only they start showing it
 Yeah 
 And then 
I want it uh actions like yeah face to
face
 Yeah 
But then if atleast you can take down the things on paper and
uhm then try doing them
Yeah I can but I am used to teach like like I was
taught in the school 
Yeah doing the things of handcraft is really a nice
thing you know you can pass time
Time
 You're doing something creative 
Creativity is also important 
Then what other things you want to do 
 That's all not not much 
But craft was my main and I liked it so much because in
the school one word 
Are you intersted in drawing also
No laughter 
Then who has put on this mehndi 
This my younger sister yesterday
Oh for the festival
No simply we had 
I was uh arranging my cupboard things and all and I found a
packet of mehndi over there and so 
 Uhm uhm 
Its nice 
Did she learn it somewhere or
No just 
On her own she's doing
Yeah on her on own 
Yesterday only the first time she 
Yeah its a nice
I was very scared to give it like to tell her to do
because if it won't look nice if it if she does wrong 
And then uh did you put it on in the evening 
Yeah about at I seven-thirty eight 
Uhm 
And I removed it in the morning 
 Haan that's why the colour has come
out so nicely
Yeah or else that was an old stock one can it

Usually the old stock doesn't give the proper colour
Yeah 
If you are interested in mehndi my 
 yeah one of my friends mehndi class
 yeah one of my friends is expert in putting on mehndi 
 Yeah 
 Mehndi class 
Yeah I want to learn to put it to others 
Yeah she is expert and she stays nearby only 
So you can go and learn it from her
Yeah I am interested to put but I don't like it
putting myself sister wanted to try it on my hand and so she 
Did she try it on her own hand also
No 
That friend of mine she can put on her own hand she
can put by left hand also on her right hand
Oh like uh no she can't do like that 
And for putting on other people's hand she is
expert 
She is Rajasthani only
