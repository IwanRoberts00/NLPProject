No just a 
""
""
""
""
""
Aunty you do craft 
""
""
No not craft as such  I do stitching work
""
""
All these  you did it
""
""
No these things have been done my  father-in-law
""
""
Oh 
""
""
He is a great artist 
""
""
You don't know anything about craft aunty 
""
""
Craft I don't know much 
""
""
Because I wanted to learn something 
""
""
I know stitching 
""
So  if you are interested in that I can teach you
""
""
Basic  the basic in stitching aunty
""
First what should we learn like 
""
""
You should start from the 
""
Uhm 
""
And the clothes in which uh 
because cutting the things is uh very important 
""
If you cut them nicely  naturally the stitching will be nice
""
""
The dress will come out nicely 
""
So  uh easy to cut
""
""
So first you should choose the smaller one  dress of a
baby 
""
And then only you can graduate to 
""
And 
most complicated thing 
""
""
Oh 
""
And uh how do you pass time like  only stitching aunty you don't
have any other uh  passtime like
""
""
""
""
""
Household work is there 
""
""
""
""
""
Stitching and teaching 
""
""
I have heard that you have that stitching with the like 
like electric current 
how how is it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh it is attatched to the machine itself 
""
And with the help of a belt  wheel of the machine
the balance wheel of the machine  that rotates with the help of that motor
""
""
So 
""
But in Bangalore 
""
""
 take it out when there is no current
and you can use it like that
""
""
Yeah yeah yeah 
""
""
""
Just that belt has to be removed 
""
And when that belt is removed you can just put on that uh other
belt 
""
""
Like for ordinary machine only you have attatched the  mo
""
""
""
Yes  ordinary machine
""
""
Earlier it 
""
But uh  I attached the motor to it
""
""
So I can use it both way 
""
There is no 
""
And whenever current is there it becomes very easy
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah because 
""
""
Using it on the pedestal  uh
feet 
""
Do you want to 
""
""
Yes  uh how
""
""
Yeah at present you won't be able
""
""
At present I won't be able but next year after my exams I
think I want to learn stitching 
""
""
And then craft uh 
""
""
Yeah craft I was taught many things in school 
""
But now  Sapna my younger sister she
is 
""
But uh  in T V I can't adjust with them and I can learn things
from  because
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I want it uh  face to
face
""
""
""
""
""
But then if atleast you can take down the things on paper and
uhm  then try doing them
""
""
Yeah I can but  like I was
taught 
""
""
Yeah doing the things of handcraft is really a  nice
thing you know you can pass time
""
""
Time
""
""
""
""
Creativity is also important 
""
Then what other things you want to do 
""
""
""
""
But craft was my main  because in
the school 
""
""
Are you intersted in drawing also
""
""
