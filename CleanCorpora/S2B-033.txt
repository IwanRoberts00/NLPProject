In today's programme we bring you a talk on the British
policy towards the tribes of north east India in the nineteenth century
The talker is Dr Anwar Hussein lecturer in the department of
History Dibrugarh University 
After the first Anglo-Burmese war of eighteen twenty-four
 twenty-six the British established themselves in the valley of
the Brahmaputra expelling the Burmese from the country 
Then they now face the new problem the problem of the hill
tribes in the north east frontier 
So the reason to formulate a policy which was not a static one
 but it had to be geared up to beat the exigencies in the frontiers
The aim and object of the policy was to control the tribal
areas for the excercise of limited administrative authority 
The political aspect of the policy and all states was to
use the tribes on the eastern fringes as a screen between the newly
acquired territories and the kingdom of Burma was initiated 
With a view to using the Sinko's tracks as a screen
 east of armies treaties were signed between Sinko chiefs and the
company chiefs 
The Mamoir tracks were also kept separate from the upper
Assam principality of Purander Sinha who was enthroned in
eighteen thirty-two and allowed to rule till eighteen thirty-eight 
for securing ready supply of provisions for British troops passing
through the region 
But exodia and jaitu contingence of British army 
were deployed to observe the in what activities of the
frontiers 
The Austro mongoloid hill tribes in north eastern India on
the other hand had maintained a potential isolation for centuries
The mountainous character of the territory linguistic
variations inter-clan feud and inter-tribal warfare had
prevented political union among the hillman 
While the superstitious customs of head hunting and
sorcery practised by some of the tribes engendered that 
a policy of indifference on the part of the neighbouring rulers 
in the plains 
The hills were clotted with dense forests and bordered by
patches of hollows and swamps 
The physiographic conditions rendered inter-communications
 almost impossible 
And while the climate was extremely innovating and the people
of the hill areas had to live in seclusion 
So the tribes except towards the west outside the western
boundary of Bhutan there was no organised kingdom hence they
were not capable of resisting the British arms 
Beginning with the Bhutias of Bhutan a series of
engagement enter with the tribes by which they undertook to
surrender their rights in these territories for a consideration
of regular payment of compensation by the Company's government
But the government in return intended not to interfere in
the internal affairs what were left alone in the hills 
In primitive times the payment of compensation in the form
of pasa or assignment of a part of revenue was a
system interlift by Ahom to reoncile the hill tribes on the
frontiers of the kingdom 
But British made a substantial change in the system which was
existed during the Ahom time 
It stopped a direct collection of the dues by the tribes
 themselves from the rayats because it led
sometimes to quarrels 
Instead of it begin to pay them some cash which was known
as black mail and it was collected at the same time through dues
from the rayats who were exempted from payment of
dues to the tribesman 
This system actually cut off the direct link between the
 rayat and the tribes 
To begin with the attitude of the tribes towards the
British government did not seem to be hostile 
The Kamtis and Shintos accepted the British overtures of
friendship and their by British was successfully the entering
 into sort of ties with them 
Abars was also friendly till the middle of the century 
The Dafalas and Aakals agreed to accept the money
payment in lieu of their right to collect their pasa 
 in the due in the doers 
But after the consolidation of the British rule in Assam 
the tribes became alive to the ensuing danger of the new system and
became restless 
Though the Kamtis revolted with the assistance of Shintos 
or in the pandal was suppressed by the British arms and
divided the whole country areas into four tracks which was under
the direct control of the government 
Like the Shintos the Abars the Aakal the Dafalas
 created problem during the British regime 
The Nagas of the Tira district continued to committ petty theft
and loot for a quiet long time 
So the guzzling feast of rich and other tribals had to do
 due to their frustration and poverty in their economic and
political reason 
So the British government had gradually begun to
substitute cash payment in lieu of articles and the money payment 
which was fixed with the then market price remained fixed all
through the British period 
In order to solve the tribal problem the British government 
introduce certain policies 
For example number one to set up out-post along roads
of the tribal movement to set the encroach of the tribe 
Number two restrictions on plains people entering into hills
for which the innerline regulation was passed in eighteen seventy-three
 which restricted the entrance of the plains people into the
tribal hill areas 
And thus minimised the contact between the hills and
the plains 
Number three to popular popularise 
the British manufactured products in the tribal hill areas 
In popularising the European products all good 
and promoting their sale they first had vital importance 
As a result tribal products mainly raw materials 
came down in the market and European good powered into the
tribal territory etcetera 
Apart from this it is predict if we see the character
of the British policy then we'll find that the hill areas
in north eastern India enjoyed a distinct feature in the
administrative map of British India 
The system innovated tended to serve the colonial interest
Anxiety for the difference of imperial frontier with China and
Burma protection of villages in the plains from tribal rage 
And exploitation of economic resources of the hill had
prompted the British authorities to abandon the earlier theory of non-
intervention 
The traditional institution were not disturbed and the
tribesman were allowed to feel that they were still governed by their
hereditary chiefs 
But the concept of a free man was completely lost and the
chiefs were no better than government servants 
The excluding regulation created a gap between the people
of the hill and the plains and even in the hill areas there were
several administrative blocks like excluded area and control area
A series of the administrative borders were created in the
region and stringent restrictions were imposed upon the
outsiders in this area 
Tribal and non-tribal were infused as new social term 
in Indian social structure 
The lost balance of unrestricted trade in the hill borders
 and a process of social assimilation was began in the
foothills 
The seat is set back due to the segregrain 
policy of the British 
The other factor was education which was left entirely to
western missionaries who were invited by the government to undertake
 post le postalisation and the
schools were supported under gram scheme aid system
In the beginning Bengali was the medium of instruction and
tribal languages were written in Bengali script 
But subsequently English became the medium and Bengali
script was replaced by Roman 
The integration of the hill people with the rest of the country
 would have been accomplished as a natural process but the
colonial attitude of the British segregating regulations and
creations of the administrative artificial walls create a big vacuum
Large number of hillman converted into Christianity but
those who believed traditional religion and practices the age old
customs were reformed as non Christians as if they had no religion
 to be mentioned 
There is no reason to accept the western science of
civilization as in a wastage 
While some traditional customs are highly scientific 
and many in Indian situation 
So the aim of the British was to safeguard their imperial 
interest and try to justify the colonial control by projecting
 some wrong understanding about the indigenous system of the hill
people as backward unemployed their own way of administration
 in the hill areas of the north eastern region
