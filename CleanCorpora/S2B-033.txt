In today's programme  the British
policy towards the tribes of north east India  in the nineteenth century
""
""
The talker  lecturer in the department of
History 
""
""
After the first Anglo-Burmese war  of eighteen twenty-four
 in the valley of
the Brahmaputra 
""
Then they now  the problem of the hill
tribes 
""
So the reason to formulate a policy which was not  a static one
 to beat the exigencies in the frontiers
""
""
The aim and object  was to control the tribal
areas 
""
The political aspect of the policy  was to
use the tribes  as a screen between the newly
acquired territories 
""
With a view to using the  as a screen
 treaties were signed between Sinko chiefs and the
company chiefs 
""
The Mamoir tracks  from the upper
Assam principality of Purander Sinha  in
eighteen thirty-two and allowed to rule 
for securing ready supply of provisions for British troops  passing
through the region 
""
But exodia and 
were deployed  of the
frontiers 
""
The Austro mongoloid hill tribes  on
the other hand  for centuries
""
""
The mountainous character of the territory  linguistic
variations  had
prevented political union 
""
While  and
sorcery 
a policy of indifference 
in the plains 
""
The hills were clotted with dense forests  and bordered by
patches of hollows 
""
The physiographic conditions  inter-communications
""
""
And while the climate was extremely innovating  and the people
of the hill areas 
""
So the tribes except towards the west  outside the western
boundary of Bhutan  they
were not capable of resisting the British arms 
""
Beginning with the Bhutias  a series of
engagement  they undertook to
surrender  for a consideration
of regular payment of compensation  government
""
""
But the government in return  in
the internal affairs 
""
In primitive times  in the form
of  was a
system  on the
frontiers of the kingdom 
""
But British made a substantial change in the system  which was
existed during the Ahom time 
""
It stopped  by the tribes
 because it led
sometimes to quarrels 
""
Instead of  which was known
as black mail  through dues
from the  from payment of
dues to the tribesman 
""
This system actually  cut off the direct link between the
""
""
To begin with  towards the
British government 
""
The Kamtis  accepted the British overtures of
friendship  entering
""
""
Abars was also friendly 
""
The Dafalas  the money
payment 
""
""
But 
the tribes became alive  and
became restless 
""
Though the Kamtis revolted 
or  and
divided the whole country areas  under
the direct control 
""
Like  the Dafalas
""
""
The Nagas of the Tira district  continued to committ petty theft
and loot 
""
So the guzzling feast of rich  tribals had to do
 in their economic and
political reason 
""
So the British government  to
substitute cash payment 
which was fixed  all
through the British period 
""
In order to solve the tribal problem 
introduce certain policies 
""
For example  along roads
of the tribal movement 
""
Number two  restrictions on plains people entering into hills
for which  the innerline regulation was passed in eighteen seventy-three
 into the
tribal hill areas 
""
And thus  and
the plains 
""
Number three 
the 
""
In popularising 
and promoting 
""
As a result 
came down in the market  into the
tribal territory etcetera 
""
Apart from this  if we see the character
of the British policy  that the hill areas
in north eastern India  in the
administrative map of British India 
""
The system  the colonial interest
""
""
Anxiety for the difference of imperial frontier  with China and
Burma 
""
And exploitation of economic resources  had
prompted the British authorities to abandon  the earlier theory of non-
intervention 
""
The traditional institution  and the
tribesman  that they were still governed by their
hereditary chiefs 
""
But the concept of a free man  and the
chiefs were no better 
""
The excluding regulation  between the people
of the hill  there were
several administrative blocks  and control area
""
""
A series of the administrative borders  in the
region  imposed upon the
outsiders in this area 
""
Tribal and non-tribal 
in Indian social structure 
""
The lost balance  in the hill borders
 began in the
foothills 
""
The 
policy of the British 
""
The other factor was education  to
western missionaries  to undertake
 and the
schools  scheme aid system
""
""
In the beginning  and
tribal languages 
""
But subsequently  Bengali
script was replaced by Roman 
""
The integration of the hill people  with the rest of the country
 the
colonial attitude of the British  and
creations of the administrative artificial walls  a big vacuum
""
""
Large number of hillman  but
those who believed  the age old
customs  as if they had no religion
""
""
There is no reason to accept  the western science of
civilization 
""
While some traditional 
and 
""
So the aim of the British 
interest  by projecting
 about the indigenous system of the hill
people  their own way of administration
