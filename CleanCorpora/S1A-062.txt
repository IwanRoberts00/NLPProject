""
""
Archana are you there  ?
""
""
Yes I am there
""
How are you Sonali  ?
""
""
I am fine
""
How are you  ?
""
""
How are your studies going on  ?
""
""
They are going on pretty well but I am now reading for the
examinations that are going to come up in 
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
I don't know I have not been studying too much that is why 
""
""
What has happened Sonali you were a too studious girl I think
""
""
""
Yeah may be because now-a-days I just keep thinking of  one
of the ideas I am getting
""
""
Thinking of what exactly about getting married  ?
""
""
No  marriage is another two to three years
""
""
""
 I think Sonali
""
""
No because before that I have to sit for my civil services 
""
I have to do I A S
""
""
Oh 
""
""
Okay now  I won't talk about that much of future right now
""
I want to talk about may be say 
""
""
About November December 
""
""
Okay 
""
""
 ?
""
""
Okay here we go 
""
I have this idea of  conducting one fun-fair at the university
""
""
""
Of conducting a pardon I beg your pardon 
""
""
A fun-fair 
""
""
Oh I think 
""
""
Thank god you appreciate it and you like it 
""
""
I think it will create a history in our department  uh not
only in the department but in the university itself 
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
Why because I think no one has uh  conducted this fun-fair
""
""
""
Before  ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So that means 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
In fact you are the one who started the Mister English  and
Miss English competition also in the department 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Isn't it so ?
""
""
Isn't it 
""
""
Okay so now 
""
The first thing is  should it be done on a
Humanities 
Eng 
""
""
If you ask my idea I think my opinion is that it should be on
the Humanities level 
""
""
Yeah thats nice atleast everybody will be  coming together
""
""
So all the departments can come together we can just enjoy
have fun 
""
""
Yeah that will be gutsy imagine  eleven department one hand
""
""
""
""
""
""
I am dreaming about that day 
""
""
Yeah but the thing is the first problem what I think we may
face is 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Because for any good thing and any bit thing you need cash on
your hands
""
""
So I think you have to plan it all 
""
""
Yeah  in fact I I just let me know because I am new around
here so I don't know 
""
Is it possible for the department to  dish out some money or
something 
""
""
Ah yeah 
ma'am 
""
""
Yeah we can 
department of social welfare  which can give us money
""
""
Yeah yeah yeah  otherwise we can go for any sponsorship
 Archies Hallmark they sponsor so they can sponsor
""
""
But what will be the conditions  and what are we supposed
to 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay like we can always talk about them  we can talk to
them if they are not charging going to charge or something very
""
""
Okay  and let you
know
""
""
Okay 
""
You know one of the stall ideas I have is a 
""
""
Request stall I did not get it 
""
""
I will tell you what a request stall is 
""
You are supposed to have a music system on your stall  that will
be only system and or  that is the only stall where you are supposed to
play 
""
""
""
""
""
 may be forty songs on the
list 
""
""
I think  request songs is it ?
""
""
Yeah request song it is and anybody paying you  the amount
you play their song for them 
""
For them or for their 
that 
""
""
""
laughs 
""
""
Yes you can earn
""
See the basic thing of fun-fair will be one of this that we will be
coming together 
""
""
""
""
""
 any fun-fair has to end in profit or in
""
""
""
Yeah I think it 
""
""
 fun-fair to end
up in a loss 
""
""
Yeah yeah we have to consider the monetary part also
""
""
Yeah monitory part is there but then again  some other
stalls 
""
Can you think of some other stall  ?
""
Can you think of some other stall  ?
""
""
I think you better think 
""
""
May be okay what do you say about an eats  you should have
something  eat upon also
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah eatables I think  will do
""
""
""
 not a bad idea
then 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah chips can be there 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And you can charge the double amount for them 
""
""
I am getting hungry 
""
""
Same here  we have
to talk about it you know
""
You have to talk about  this and tell to the other classmates
also 
""
You have to take their 
noes  also
""
""
I think Sonali  you are the right person to take the
initiative 
""
""
Okay  and the next stall at
but of course about double your money 
""
I know 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah but 
Diwali  paisa
""
""
""
So we can have a 
laughs 
""
""
You 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah we can have it  but in fact for double your money it
is always like uhn 
""
""
Okay
""
""
That you through the dices and the  who
reaches at next end  earns double the
money  if at one time you are getting ten people on
your stall  I
think ninety bucks on your hand  eighty bucks on your
hand
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Anything new  ?
""
""
The new thing may be  we may have a dance floor or
something 
""
""
Yeah I think rain dance 
""
""
Yeah rain dance  but from where the
water is going to come 
""
""
We can go outside 
""
""
 but then we can
always have something of uh 
you 
""
""
""
""
Again we can have Miss personality Mister personality 
""
""
Yeah and we have a Miss Rose too 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
How come there is no Mister Rose around  why is always
there is a Miss Rose you know 
""
""
I think we  this time we will conduct a Mister Rose
competition also 
""
""
Uh Mister Rose competition
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Not a bad idea at all 
""
""
The most handsome boy will get the award 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Oh
""
""
That is the person who gets the maximum number of roses from
the people 
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn  there can be many competitors
at that time you know  but the thing is we have to let all the department
in the university know about it 
""
""
may be the colleges or something 
""
""
Yeah we can popularise it to the newspaper  T V media like
the cable 
""
""
""
""
The thing can be  what you call the
notices 
the different departments of the university physics department is there 
you don't have any interaction with the people from that department 
""
""
Yeah yeah yeah 
""
""
Chemistry department the geography department is also there
""
""
I think we can make it on the university level also like 
all other departments  excluding uh including the humanities and also the
science 
""
""
But then that will consume lots of time and after December
""
""
""
 studies are there
""
""
Studies are there 
""
This is M A part two with final year 
""
And after this I will be thanking god like anything if I just
complete this M A with good marks 
""
""
Sonali don't worry 
""
""
I hope  I really hope
""
I scored pretty good marks in my first year  but I don't know
what is going to happen in second year 
""
""
You will score  work
hard 
""
""
Hey speaking of this uh  M A and what do you plan to do
after M A  ?
""
""
Now  just finish my M A
""
""
""
God knows are you planning to get married or something 
""
""
I don't know probably may be 
""
""
May be of course  fifty percent of the class girls will be
""
""
Anyway I  doing I A S now
""
My parents  and in fact first I was
thinking of becoming a lecturer only  but then something happened and now
 I am going to sit for I A S
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think you can be a lecturer 
""
""
 and it is the
profession I love 
""
I love to teach  see what happen in the
future  mean NET and SET are to big hurdles that are standing in the way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
challenged 
""
""
I can  hope god is on my side and we
compete in a 
""
And what about you like  you are doing a computer course
now-a-days
""
""
Yeah  so
after the M A I think I better do my computers 
""
""
Continue your computers and what about the job  or
something
""
""
Job 
""
I have my own school like my aunty has my school so I can work
over there 
""
""
You worked before somewhere 
""
""
No sorry 
""
""
I worked for two months with a private firm and it was one
good experience you know
""
""
So you have to give a party I think pending 
""
""
God why do all these people just go for party  yaar
""
""
""
 you have got your own money
""
""
I had it I spent it I have blown it up 
""
""
This is not fair Sonali
""
""
It is  in fact it was a good experience the
confidence I have in me now  different kind of
people 
""
I mean people can be rude if they want to be  and they can be
very sweet  if again they want to be
""
""
""
""
""
I think now-a-days everyone needs exposure 
""
""
Everyone 
""
""
 ?
""
""
Yes 
""
That is why I am sometimes surprise to see the girls out here 
like when we have a welcome function 
two words  okay there were another
two of them who were going to sing or something  you you ask them
to do a  group activity maybe a group dance or song none of them come
forward
""
I don't know why do they have this inhibitions about themselves
""
""
""
You know Sonali I always dream that I I could dance like you
""
""
""
Thanks a lot for the compliment 
""
""
""
""
""
Thank you so much  but this is
""
""
Which is I can only do I think  dance
""
""
""
That is also true art there you know  to dance like a god
""
""
But in fact I feel  I feel sometimes very bad when I see my own
 girl friends
""
""
Oh oh oh
""
""
I don't have any boy friends don't look at me like that
""
""
Oh oh wondering are you telling the truth 
""
""
Yes 
""
In fact it is very  sometimes it is very hurting to see them
just sitting there like  they
should be told to do something 
""
""
""
lack  they are lacking it
""
""
Yeah that is why I  wish all of them should work atleast
for two months  and they should come to see the world properly
""
""
The feel of your money on your hand is very different 
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
It is
""
""
I am dreaming about it 
""
