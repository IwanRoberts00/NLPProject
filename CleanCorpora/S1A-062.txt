<I>
Archana are you there ?
Yes I am there
How are you Sonali ?
I am fine
How are you ?
How are your studies going on ?
They are going on pretty well but I am now reading for the
examinations that are going to come up in April or May 
Why ?
I don't know I have not been studying too much that is why 
What has happened Sonali you were a too studious girl I think
Yeah may be because now-a-days I just keep thinking of one
of the ideas I am getting
Thinking of what exactly about getting married ?
No not marriage marriage is another two to three years
 uh before that 
 Uh too long I think Sonali
No because before that I have to sit for my civil services 
I have to do I A S
Oh it's really fabulous thing 
Okay now I won't talk about that much of future right now
I want to talk about may be say November December 
About November December I did not get it Sonali 
Okay I 
 Can you explain it ?
Okay here we go 
I have this idea of conducting one fun-fair at the university
Of conducting a pardon I beg your pardon 
A fun-fair 
Oh I think it's really a fabulous job 
Thank god you appreciate it and you like it 
I think it will create a history in our department uh not
only in the department but in the university itself 
Why ?
Why because I think no one has uh conducted this fun-fair
Before ?
Yeah
So that means we'll be the pioneers 
Yeah laughs probably so 
In fact you are the one who started the Mister English and
Miss English competition also in the department 
Yeah 
Isn't it so ?
Isn't it 
Okay so now I'll start up with the fun- fair 
The first thing is what you say should it be done on a
Humanities department or a Humanities level as a whole or in 
Eng English department level 
If you ask my idea I think my opinion is that it should be on
the Humanities level so that we can know each other 
Yeah thats nice atleast everybody will be coming together
So all the departments can come together we can just enjoy
have fun 
Yeah that will be gutsy imagine eleven department one hand
 oh on one ground 
 Oh 
I am dreaming about that day laughs 
Yeah but the thing is the first problem what I think we may
face is the money 
Yeah
Because for any good thing and any bit thing you need cash on
your hands
So I think you have to plan it all 
Yeah in fact I I just let me know because I am new around
here so I don't know 
Is it possible for the department to dish out some money or
something 
Ah yeah it's possible we can talk with Maya 
ma'am 
Yeah we can otherwise we also have a I think 
department of social welfare which can give us money
Yeah yeah yeah otherwise we can go for any sponsorship
 Archies Hallmark they sponsor so they can sponsor
But what will be the conditions and what are we supposed
to offer them 
 Nothing conditions I think uh 
Okay like we can always talk about them we can talk to
them if they are not charging going to charge or something very
Okay let's see I will talk with them and let you
know
Okay and as for the stalls 
You know one of the stall ideas I have is a request stall 
Request stall I did not get it 
I will tell you what a request stall is 
You are supposed to have a music system on your stall that will
be only system and or that is the only stall where you are supposed to
play play music for the whole of the fun-fair 
 Ok 
 You can have a may be forty songs on the
list 
I think request songs is it ?
Yeah request song it is and anybody paying you the amount
you play their song for them 
For them or for their people around or something like 
that 
 Okay so we can get money also I think 
laughs 
Yes you can earn
See the basic thing of fun-fair will be one of this that we will be
coming together 
 Okay 
 Secondly any fun-fair has to end in profit or in
 pour income 
Yeah I think it is yeah 
 It is very difficult for a fun-fair to end
up in a loss 
Yeah yeah we have to consider the monetary part also
Yeah monitory part is there but then again some other
stalls 
Can you think of some other stall ?
Can you think of some other stall Archana ?
I think you better think laughs 
May be okay what do you say about an eats you should have
something to eat upon also
 Eats 
Yeah eatables I think samosas will do
 Samosas yeah that's not a bad idea
then the chips 
 Because they are chi uh cheap also 
Yeah chips can be there 
Yeah 
And you can charge the double amount for them 
I am getting hungry 
Same here laughter but yaar we have
to talk about it you know
You have to talk about this and tell to the other classmates
also 
You have to take their yeses and 
noes also
I think Sonali you are the right person to take the
initiative 
Okay let's see that but uh and the next stall at
but of course about double your money 
I know it's a sort of gamble in the university campus 
 but 
 I think you should explain this thing 
Yeah but Diwali is there come on 
Diwali is supposed to be a bit of gamble a bit of paisa
 money here and money there you know 
So we can have a chakli stall also 
laughs 
You may 
 Like Diwali stall 
Yeah we can have it but in fact for double your money it
is always like uhn you can have a car race stall 
Okay
That you through the dices and the person who
reaches at next end the earliest the person earns double the
money so if at one time you are getting ten people on
your stall you pay one person twenty bucks and still you have I
think ninety bucks on your hand or okay eighty bucks on your
hand
 Okay 
 Okay 
 Okay 
 It's really a good idea I think 
Anything new ?
The new thing may be we may have a dance floor or
something 
Yeah I think rain dance 
Yeah rain dance laughter but from where the
water is going to come 
We can go outside it's raining laughter 
 That's not a bad idea at all but then we can
always have something of uh you know what they call that lucky draw 
you know 
 Okay yeah yeah 
Again we can have Miss personality Mister personality 
Yeah and we have a Miss Rose too 
Yeah
How come there is no Mister Rose around why is always
there is a Miss Rose you know 
I think we this time we will conduct a Mister Rose
competition also laughs 
Uh Mister Rose competition
Yeah 
Not a bad idea at all 
The most handsome boy will get the award 
Yeah and the most beautiful girl will get the award 
Oh
That is the person who gets the maximum number of roses from
the people around 
 I wish I could get the award 
Ahn that has to be seen there can be many competitors
at that time you know but the thing is we have to let all the department
in the university know about it 
 In infact the people outside the department also 
may be the colleges or something 
Yeah we can popularise it to the newspaper T V media like
the cable news 
 That is going to be an expensive 
The thing can be you can have some what you call the
notices and then just go and just put them up in the colleges 
the different departments of the university physics department is there 
you don't have any interaction with the people from that department 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Chemistry department the geography department is also there
I think we can make it on the university level also like 
all other departments excluding uh including the humanities and also the
science computer this thing we can include all of them 
But then that will consume lots of time and after December
 please no more active activities only 
 I know studies are there
Studies are there 
This is M A part two with final year 
And after this I will be thanking god like anything if I just
complete this M A with good marks 
Sonali don't worry you'll complete it 
I hope I really hope
I scored pretty good marks in my first year but I don't know
what is going to happen in second year 
You will score yaar believe in god work
hard 
Hey speaking of this uh M A and what do you plan to do
after M A ?
Now let's see I'll just finish my M A
 and then god knows 
God knows are you planning to get married or something 
I don't know probably may be laughs 
May be of course fifty percent of the class girls will be
 married by the time M A completes up 
Anyway I I have in fact planned about doing I A S now
My parents wanted it and in fact first I was
thinking of becoming a lecturer only but then something happened and now
 I am going to sit for I A S
 Married yeah 
 Vow 
I think you can be a lecturer better 
 Yeah that is it is a job and it is the
profession I love 
I love to teach but let's see what happen in the
future mean NET and SET are to big hurdles that are standing in the way
 in I A S also similar one word 
 Oh 
 But they are channel uh 
challenged I think you can accept the challenge 
I can let's hope god is on my side and we
compete in a proper way 
And what about you like you are doing a computer course
now-a-days
Yeah right now I am doing my computer course so so
after the M A I think I better do my computers continue my computers 
Continue your computers and what about the job or
something
Job let's see 
I have my own school like my aunty has my school so I can work
over there 
You worked before somewhere 
No sorry 
I worked for two months with a private firm and it was one
good experience you know
So you have to give a party I think pending laughs 
God why do all these people just go for party yaar
 you never asked before 
 Because you have got your own money
I had it I spent it I have blown it up laughs 
This is not fair Sonali
It is it is in fact it was a good experience the
confidence I have in me now to handle different kind of
people 
I mean people can be rude if they want to be and they can be
very sweet if again they want to be
 Yeah yeah 
I think now-a-days everyone needs exposure 
Everyone needs 
 Isn't it ?
Yes 
That is why I am sometimes surprise to see the girls out here 
like when we have a welcome function I was the only girl who danced 
two words you know and rest of the girls okay there were another
two of them who were going to sing or something but you you ask them
to do a group activity maybe a group dance or song none of them come
forward
I don't know why do they have this inhibitions about themselves
You know Sonali I always dream that I I could dance like you
Thanks a lot for the compliment 
 It's a god given gift I think 
Thank you so much but this is
Which is I can only do I think Ganpati dance
 laughter 
That is also true art there you know to dance like a god
But in fact I feel I feel sometimes very bad when I see my own
 friends gi girl friends
Oh oh oh
I don't have any boy friends don't look at me like that
Oh oh wondering are you telling the truth laughter 
Yes a proper truth 
In fact it is very sometimes it is very hurting to see them
just sitting there like somebody should go to them and then they
should be told to do something no initiative 
 I think they need exposure thats the 
lack they are lacking it
Yeah that is why I wish all of them should work atleast
for two months on hand and they should come to see the world properly
The feel of your money on your hand is very different 
Yeah yeah 
It is
I am dreaming about it 
Yeah we can just dream 
So what are your different uh what are your other hobbies ?
What all you do at home ?
Hobbies okay 
 Like to cook 
Cooking leave aside cooking is too far from me laughs
 kitchen
I think I like to roam about 
Yeah I have seen you do that laughter 
 Then 
Oh so you were also roaming laughs 
No I was purchasing some vegetables for home laughs 
Then I was also purchasing something
No no you were not laughs you were not
Again chatting with my friends enjoying life 
watching T V
Yeah that is one pass time everybody loves 
 Television 
And another thing is just watching cricket
Cricket
I love cricket 
That is one game I cannot stand I mean I don't
 know there it's come on yaar 
 Why 
 It's really a interesting game
 yaar 
They are twenty-two people just after one ball you know
somebody trying to hit it and somebody trying to catch it
Oh 
And sitting for three hours and
I think you are too boring laughter 
No no I am not see see just imagine you sit for
nearly two and half hours in front of T V trying just tensing
yourself so badly that your fears are standing on your nerves end and
everything is in such a halobalo at home of course I have seen my dad
