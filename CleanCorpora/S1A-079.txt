<I>
""
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
And I am Sudeep Minhas 
""
""
So  Sudeep what do you think we should talk about this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
discussion 
""
""
""
""
""
Right
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  your experience
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How strongly you feel about 
feminism  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a 
""
""
enjoyed more privileges 
""
""
Do you regret being a career woman  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
feminist  ?
""
""
 assigned
 to women
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
have certain dreams and uh  when I was about twenty-five
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Got lot of problems
""
""
""
""
""
So I think uhm  what when you were talking
""
""
 when you come
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
much better position and a situation than I am 
""
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
I am the one who is supposed to be you know  going out and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Are you trying to say that as we get on in years we become
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
different  and the convention been different then I would have certainly
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in that sense  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Opting for a career only way of seeking liberation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that
""
 I mean sometimes I think you
""
this is some kind of an outset
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I mean you make them sit at home for  uh uh
""
""
""
""
""
I think  breaking
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right
""
""
This is physical moving out  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Of course he has got an absolutely different  uh say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I know I am going to raise lot of hackles when I say that 
""
""
 biology and biology
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ground had  I mean we give a lot of meaning to what biology means as such
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Nor do I for that matter
""
""
And  justify thing
""
""
And if 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  that would be another way of looking at it but uh
""
""
""
You mean biologically men are stronger than women ?
""
""
I am not  talking in terms of relative strength
""
""
But  whether it is
psychology or  or behaviourial
""
""
""
""
""
""
It begins there 
""
""
No I think 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
men  ?
""
I I would not really be very happy with that kind of situation 
""
men  because
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
place 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 so
""
""
""
""
""
""
can do
""
""
""
""
""
But that does not
""
""
Call it a previlege or  but
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No but 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I think half the time he doesn't succeed 
""
""
I don't know about that problem but I think you know  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And it so much more natural for a mother to have that kind of
""
""
""
""
""
should not be doing this and this thing  is that some kind of a constraint
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You accept yourself for what you are
""
""
Yes right 
""
""
You accept your limitations 
""
""
""
Very fine
""
""
""
""
""
If a man also wants to  liberate himself then I think every
man needs to liberate himself or  all human beings need to liberate
""
""
that we all  think about
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Terms you can define for yourself
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
important 
""
For a man and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
personal example for that matter 
""
""
""
""
I will give you an example 
""
My husband  a very clean house
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
I don't
