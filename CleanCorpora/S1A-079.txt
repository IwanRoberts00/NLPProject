<I>
""
""
Uh 
""
I am Rana Nayar 
""
""
And I am Sudeep Minhas 
""
""
So  Sudeep what do you think we should talk about this
morning  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Why don't you set the ball rolling 
""
""
 what I am thinking
""
 talk about feminism
""
""
discussion 
""
I think  I
""
""
""
Right
""
""
So I 
""
""
 uh more personal in nature
because 
""
""
Yes we won't talk
""
""
I was just 
experience 
""
Uh and how of course I  off as the feminist
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So  your experience
""
""
""
""
""
About how 
""
""
""
""
""
How man feel
""
""
How strongly you feel about 
feminism  ?
""
""
""
""
Uh now  we can't say how strongly I feel about it
""
But I think it  most of the personal experience is that you
slowly  being a working woman makes you more of
a 
""
Had I been a 
enjoyed more privileges 
""
""
Do you regret being a career woman  ?
""
""
""
""
 the satisfaction
for my subject gives me  balances
the whole thing 
""
But sometimes I think  uh I certainly wish I just could relax at
home and you know  if were to do
just those chores and I would feel certainly much more happier 
""
""
But that will  uh
feminist  ?
""
Then then  no
 assigned
 to women
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 this is what I had
encountered 
""
Not that I want to be like that
""
This is what I have encountered from 
""
""
 you won't like
""
""
Exactly 
""
I mean  young girls
have certain dreams and uh  when I was about twenty-five
twenty-six  just before my marriage
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
I I had this kind of a dream that  going
to set certain rules  and he is working we are
going to divide 
""
But I think 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Got lot of problems
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
So I think uhm  what when you were talking
about yesterday  sets
out thinking that yes one is  when actually slowly you
 when you come
down to the ground realities  I think one is so much more happier in the
conventional truth 
""
 happened with me
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
When I think it would have been  I think my mother is in a
much better position and a situation than I am 
""
She is much more respected 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
I am the one who is supposed to be you know  going out and
having fun but still I am working the most of the  you know
""
""
And my mother just because she is a mother you know she is lady of
the house
""
She has so much more respect 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh  lose out on that
""
And I sometimes wish and I crave for that kind of  an adoration
and looking upto 
""
""
Are you trying to say that as we get on in years we become
more of  idea ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  I think had I been given
enough uh  had the situation been
different  and the convention been different then I would have certainly
loved to be a liberated  the working
woman or a professional kind
""
I would have certainly loved to be that
""
""
Would you like to say that all  working women are liberated
in that sense  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Then ?
""
""
I mean I would have loved
""
""
Opting for a career only way of seeking liberation 
""
""
Yes it is of course to  to a
great extent  with
that to a great extent of course as sometimes doing 
""
""
""
""
""
 Uh would you like to think of liberation purely in
ecnomic  terms
""
""
 not just
that
""
 I mean sometimes I think you
just tend to  build up so much when you are at home and
this is some kind of an outset
""
I think 
psychological also 
""
And the  I think
 man enjoys that don't they ?
""
I mean you make them sit at home for  uh uh
not even a week  if they have a
prolonged weekend they just begin to tend to get  they
 they feel
confined 
""
I think  breaking
of the psychological barrier yes that 
""
""
""
""
""
Right
""
""
This is physical moving out  uh
with the 
""
""
Right 
""
""
Right 
 laughter
""
""
I hope
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Of course we can always  as
far 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Of course he has got an absolutely different  uh say
""
""
No because I am a staunch believer in uh 
biological determinant 
""
""
 is biological determinant ?
""
""
""
""
""
I know I am going to raise lot of hackles when I say that 
""
But this is exactly what  uh what my life experience is that
 biology and biology
is what conditions are 
""
And we cannot really be any different  or we cannot really go
very far 
""
""
 biology
""
""
I think let to itself it would have been much more simpler
""
I mean  uh on the equal
ground had  I mean we give a lot of meaning to what biology means as such
""
""
""
I am not really trying to
""
""
And this is 
biological determinism exactly 
""
I have no  background about this
""
""
""
""
""
Nor do I for that matter
""
""
And  justify thing
""
""
And if 
""
""
I know  but I
""
that's 
""
""
""
""
Yeah  that would be another way of looking at it but uh
""
""
""
You mean biologically men are stronger than women ?
""
""
I am not  talking in terms of relative strength
""
""
But  whether it is
psychology or  or behaviourial
pattern 
""
Everything else follows 
""
Everything else comes later 
""
It begins there 
""
""
No I think 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 liberation
uh  more of men than
 women
""
Is that what they want  ?
""
Equality with men  they want to be like
men  ?
""
I I would not really be very happy with that kind of situation 
if women were to be  to become
men  because
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 I mean they
""
""
As far as that goes  reversal of roles can never take
place 
""
""
I I uh 
""
""
 one of
the extreme  man can never give birth
""
""
I was thinking of it 
 so
""
""
""
""
""
You see that is something which  alone
can do
""
""
""
""
""
But that does not
""
""
Call it a previlege or  but
 poorer for this
reason  they cannot give birth
""
""
""
""
""
No but 
 should
be allowed to do this  be allowed to do this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
One way in which they can somehow satisfy  a creative
impulse 
""
A man is always trying to  give expression to
it in so many different ways
""
And I think half the time he doesn't succeed 
""
""
I don't know about that problem but I think you know  uh
 the
husband is  I mean as you were saying about this
reversal of role  that should not
be  of other
things
""
I mean I think she feels proud of it yes  that she is a mother
""
""
And it so much more natural for a mother to have that kind of
relationship with the child which of course the father can never have it of
""
""
But 
I mean  she
should not be doing this and this thing  is that some kind of a constraint
""
Just because she happens to be a mother
""
""
""
""
""
Certainly not 
suggest that 
""
The idea is  you first identify yourself with what you are
""
You accept yourself for what you are
""
""
Yes right 
""
""
You accept your limitations 
and from there you proceed 
""
""
Very fine
""
""
You see  may be or a man for that matter let
me not talk 
""
If a man also wants to  liberate himself then I think every
man needs to liberate himself or  all human beings need to liberate
themselves because  to move towards
some kind of an autonomy  this is something
that we all  think about
""
And this is 
""
""
""
""
""
Exactly
""
""
Moving towards some kind of a higher state  yes
""
""
Growth which you may measure in  chose
to 
""
First 
spiritual  any term you chose to
""
Terms you can define for yourself
""
But  and that
alone  means liberation to me
""
""
""
""
""
Exactly
""
""
So  very
important 
""
For a man and 
himself herself 
""
And this kind of self- acceptance is exactly what doesn't really
count most 
""
""
Exactly as it is
""
""
Which becomes a hindrance 
this in itself is a kind of bondage 
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
 uh a
personal example for that matter 
""
When you were saying that  uh woman
want to be liberated 
""
I will give you an example 
""
My husband  a very clean house
""
He 
""
He likes to do all the things 
""
And believe it he loves to do needle work also
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
I don't 
""
I am the one who would rather sit and have a 
newspaper 
""
Yes I love to 
""
But he 
""
Whenever we are together  on the weekend
""
You know  man's
 I I
""
""
Not necessarily 
""
""
No yes 
""
""
Not necessarily
""
""
Yes 
""
I I I  so many examples from
""
""
""
""
""
""
No
