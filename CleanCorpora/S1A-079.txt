<I>
Uh right 
I am Rana Nayar 
And I am Sudeep Minhas 
So Sudeep what do you think we should talk about this
morning ?
 That's what I am thinking laughs 
Why don't you set the ball rolling 
 That's what I am thinking
 Let's talk about feminism
 Let's just continue the yesterday's 
discussion 
I think it's very interesting I I I
 wasn't participating yesterday 
Right
So I would like 
 But that was uh more personal in nature
because 
Yes we won't talk
I was just uh drawing upon my personal 
experience and talking about it 
Uh and how of course I started off as the feminist
 and uh became more of a male chauvinist later 
 Experience 
 A few words 
Yes 
So why don't you share a bit of your experience
 so that we will be on 
 About feminism 
About how man feel 
 Even ground 
How man feel
How strongly you feel about this whole idea of 
feminism ?
 Feminism right 
Uh now I'll we can't say how strongly I feel about it
But I think it most of the personal experience is that you
slowly begin to realise that being a working woman makes you more of
a you know a target of male chauvinism 
Had I been a housewife I think I would have certainly 
enjoyed more privileges than I do now laughs 
Do you regret being a career woman ?
 Is that what you are trying 
 No I think the satisfaction the satisfaction
for my subject gives me uh I mean it's a kind of balances
the whole thing 
But sometimes I think uh I certainly wish I just could relax at
home and you know the chores that I do now I mean if were to do
just those chores and I would feel certainly much more happier 
But that will not really make you uh
feminist ?
Then then what you are asking for no
 is some kind of a typical role that is assigned
 to women
 Well I 
 No 
 No 
 Exactly 
 No the 
 I'm saying I am saying this is what I had
encountered 
Not that I want to be like that
This is what I have encountered from me 
 Given a choice you won't like
Exactly uhm exactly 
I mean uh we have certain dreams I feel all young girls
have certain dreams and uh then uh when I was about twenty-five
twenty-six just before my marriage
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm 
I I had this kind of a dream that okay I'm going
to set certain rules if I'm working and he is working we are
going to divide uh what we are going to do 
But I think and I ended up with a lot of problems 
Uhm uhm
Got lot of problems
Uhm uhm 
So I think uhm that's what when you were talking
about yesterday one word better you know that yes one sets
out thinking that yes one is feminist but when actually slowly you
 when you when you actually uh face the realities when you come
down to the ground realities I think one is so much more happier in the
conventional truth 
 Same's happened with me
Uhm uhm 
When I think it would have been I think my mother is in a
much better position and a situation than I am 
She is much more respected 
Ah ha 
I am the one who is supposed to be you know going out and
having fun but still I am working the most of the one word you know
 laughter 
And my mother just because she is a mother you know she is lady of
the house
She has so much more respect 
Uhm uhm 
And uh I think I lose out on that
And I sometimes wish and I crave for that kind of an adoration
and looking upto laughter looking upto 
Are you trying to say that as we get on in years we become
more of uh man or more of woman uh is that the idea ?
 Now about the one word 
Yes I mean have we I mean I think had I been given
enough uh wh what should I say had the situation been
different and the convention been different then I would have certainly
loved to be a liberated woman or the or as we say the working
woman or a professional kind
I would have certainly loved to be that
Would you like to say that all working women are liberated
in that sense in your words ?
 No they are not no no 
Then ?
I mean I would have loved
Opting for a career only way of seeking liberation 
Yes it is of course to uh to ce to a
great extent yes I I I agree with
that to a great extent of course as sometimes doing one word 
 Is it not 
 Uh would you like to think of liberation purely in
ecnomic terms
 It's >/w> not just that Rana it's not just
that
 It's so much more you can I mean sometimes I think you
just tend to uh build a build up so much when you are at home and
this is some kind of an outset
I think it's not just economical it's 
psychological also 
And the the very fact of moving out of the house I think
 man enjoys that don't they ?
I mean you make them sit at home for uh say about uh uh
not even a week say two days I mean right if they have a
prolonged weekend they just begin to tend to get irritated they
 they won't move one word they feel
confined 
I think the very fact you know this this breaking
of the psychological barrier yes that even I am moving out 
 Right 
Right
This is physical moving out is sometime equated uh
with the with the psychological uh opening up 
Right 
Right uhm I mean you can carry on 
 uhm I mean I don't know what to think about that laughter
I hope
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Of course we can always agree to differ as
far this is concerned because 
 Oh yes 
 Why not why not why not 
Of course he has got an absolutely different uh say
No because I am a staunch believer in uh what I call 
biological determinant you see 
 Now what is biological determinant ?
 Please explain that you were saying yesterday also 
 Uh I know uh uh I know I know laughter 
I know I am going to raise lot of hackles when I say that 
But this is exactly what uh what my life experience is that
 things are what they are because of bio biology and biology
is what conditions are 
And we cannot really be any different or we cannot really go
very far from where we start 
 I think don't we give meanings to biology
I think let to itself it would have been much more simpler
I mean it would have been much more uh on the equal
ground had I mean we give a lot of meaning to what biology means as such
I am not really trying to
And this is I don't know anything about 
biological determinism exactly laughter 
I have no scholarly laughs background about this
 So do impose and stuck upon 
Nor do I for that matter
And two words justify thing
And if not really meant be scholarly discussion but 
I know no but still I don't what it is but I
 somehow feel personally that we give a lot of meaning because 
that's the way we want it to be 
 That's the way our society wants it to be 
Yeah that would be another way of looking at it but uh
You mean biologically men are stronger than women ?
I am not talk talking in terms of relative strength
 that men are stronger and women are weaker 
But what I am trying to suggest is that whether it is
psychology or sociology or cultural pattern or behaviourial
pattern all stem from a certain kind of biological makeup 
Everything else follows you see 
Everything else comes later 
It begins there 
No I think it begins no no no 
 And 
 And and perhaps you see 
 when when when women talk in terms of liberation
uh ar are they talking in terms of being more of men than
 women
Is that what they want ?
Equality with men does it mean that they want to be like
men ?
I I would not really be very happy with that kind of situation 
if women were to be like men or where try to become
men because
 I feel 
 This is I can I 
 That's true I mean they
As far as that goes reversal of roles can never take
place 
I I uh I am agree 
 For instance one of the extreme is one of
the extreme position that I think of is that man can never give birth
I was thinking of it I was thinking of it 
 so
 So to say 
You see that is something which women alone
can do
 One word 
But that does not
Call it a previlege or whatever yes but
 it's granted only to uh I think men are poorer for this
reason that they are they cannot give birth
 Yes 
No but that's I think that is a 
 very fine way of saying we are poor so we should
be allowed to do this we should be allowed to do this
 Because 
 Because 
 This is this is 
 This is 
One way in which they can somehow satisfy a creative
impulse 
A man is always trying to laughs give expression to
it in so many different ways
And I think half the time he doesn't succeed 
I don't know about that problem but I think you know uh
 laughter what's more important is as I was saying the
husband is one word I mean as you were saying about this
reversal of role I believe in it yes and I think that should not
be just by giving birth I think she should not be denied of other
things
I mean I think she feels proud of it yes that she is a mother
And it so much more natural for a mother to have that kind of
relationship with the child which of course the father can never have it of
 right but it develops slowly 
But again is that an excuse for her not being 
I mean so that she should not be taking such and such role she
should not be doing this and this thing is that some kind of a constraint
Just because she happens to be a mother
 Right 
Certainly not and I want I don't even want to 
suggest that it should be a kind of a constraint 
The idea is you first identify yourself with what you are
You accept yourself for what you are
Yes right 
You accept your limitations you accept your strength 
and from there you proceed 
Very fine
You see a woman may be or a man for that matter let
me not talk only of women 
If a man also wants to liberate himself then I think every
man needs to liberate himself or all human beings need to liberate
themselves because all of us have this basic impulse to move towards
some kind of an autonomy growth may be this is something
that we all think about
And this is exactly what I mean by liberation 
 Exactly 
Exactly
Moving towards some kind of a higher state yes
 of growth 
Growth which you may measure in whatever terms you chose
to 
First one word maybe social psychological 
spiritual material any term you chose to
Terms you can define for yourself
But I am talking about the basic idea of growth and that
alone means liberation to me
 Yes 
Exactly
So for that kind of growth I think it's very
important I mean that's the way I look at it 
For a man and for that matter even a woman to accept 
himself herself 
And this kind of self- acceptance is exactly what doesn't really
count most one word 
Exactly as it is
Which becomes a hindrance in a way and 
this in itself is a kind of bondage 
 I 
Right 
 I'll give you I'll give you uh a
personal example for that matter 
When you were saying that when woman want to be uh woman
want to be liberated are they trying to be like man 
I will give you an example 
My husband likes a very clean house
He likes to remain at home 
He likes to do all the things 
And believe it he loves to do needle work also
Uhm uhm 
I don't 
I am the one who would rather sit and have a one word 
newspaper 
Yes I love to that is one thing I like to 
But he do does all the other things 
Whenever we are together on the weekend
You know thinking is generally thought to be a man's
 priority right I I
Not necessarily 
No yes 
Not necessarily
Yes 
I I I you know I will give you so many examples from
 Men are warriors not thinkers 
No laughter
