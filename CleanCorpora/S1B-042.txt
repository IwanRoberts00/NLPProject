 Recording broken 
He was born to a wealthy landlord 
He got good education and got well-paid cosy job with the
Planning Commission 
But he soon realised that the fruits of planning and development did
not really reach the needy 
He was disillusioned 
His restless soul drove him to the solitary solitude of the
Himalayas 
But even the life of sanyasi disillusioned him 
So he decided to go back to Andhra Pradesh to write a book on the
tribals 
But what he saw shocked him 
He saw woman being yoked instead of oxen 
Enough was enough he decided 
He gave up the idea of writing the book and decided to work for
the welfare of the tribals 
He became their liberator 
He is P K S Madhavan 
 Let's meet him 
 Let's hear more about him his experience and the
voluntary organisation he set up from him 
Mr Madhavan could you tell us about this volantary organisation
 AWARE which you set up ?
In nineteen seventy-five when I moved into Andhra Pradesh
 with the interest of writing a book on tribals 
I did a small research in one block where about five thousand
tribals were given about ten million rupees in a
government programme 
And once our former Prime Minister was telling only twelve percent
of the money reached people 
My research in that particular block I found only two percent
reached people 
And ten years we made all efforts to see that these people come up
But I found that why this is happening ?
Millions of rupees were put in 
Why people are not responding ?
And I discovered people are not part of planning not part
of implementation not part of evaluation 
So I thought writing a book is an intellectual exploitation 
I get my name I get my doctorate but people are not going
to benefit out of it 
So I said I'm not going to write a book 
 I'll create awareness among the people so that they
will decide their future 
So with that intention I started this organisation AWARE
How did you realise that only two percent of the planning and
development really reached the people ?
You see when I tracked the money where it has gone I
found out sixty-two percent has gone to maintain the administration
bureaucracy and other things 
And about thirty percent of the money has gone by middle man
 corruption and commission etcetera 
Seven percent of this money reached poor people 
So I felt atleast seven percent reached 
When I investigated five percent of this money was misused by
the people themselves 
So only two percent reached people 
So this is the fate of our planning and implementation 
Then what will happen to our country ?
So I said why this is happening ?
People must be able to know what they wanted ?
Where they live ?
What their future ?
So people's participation is a fundamental necessity 
for any development
How did you make people participate in your ventures ?
How did you draw out the meek tribals into your work ?
In the beginning people did not trust me
Because I'm a new person and I'm talking a
different language and they did not believe me at all
In some place there was an opposition 
People thrown threw stone at me 
In one village they want wanted to shoot
at me as with the arrows 
But persuasion continuous meeting and explaining them and
motivation has helped me after six months eight months to people to
understand there is a man who is talking about them and trying to help
them 
So that is how I just tempted and also I used telling the
stories to the children meeting the women talking to the elderly
people 
Slowly I became friend of them and they started accepting 
How do you communicate with the tribals ?
In the beginning I was talking a a with the
 help of a interpreter a local man 
Normally a vested interest their opinion maker 
Slowly slowly when I was able to observe the their
problems I started directly talking to them 
Childrens were first my media 
When elderly people I used to talk to them 
Ramayana I used to talk to 
Mahabharata 
Some of the stories of tribal culture
That is how I became friend with them 
And I never expected anything from them 
I never asked them to do anything 
Simply discussing becoming friend 
So slowly they took me as a friend and then they started
telling their problems 
What was your first impression of tribals when you really met
them in nineteen seventy-five and what is your impression of them now ?
You see my expe my assessment of this poverty in
our country is poverty is a conspiracy 
And always people think by giving money poverty can be removed
It is not true 
To remove the poverty what we need is courage psychological
make up people must prepare themselves 
And among the tribals they are meek they are afraid of the new
people they don't understand what exactly happening and they are very
traditional they are away from the communication 
And even the small communicators were exploiters 
So as a result they did not respond to the real development of our
country
And what is their state now ?
Now after fifteen years of my entry and my one
word work perhaps what I can say is that what we have done is to
explain to the people what government is doing for them 
What government infrastructure 
Infact in the whole of the world our country has got an
excellent legislation 
Always in favour of poor 
Our constitution our legislations always in favour of poor 
But this has to be translated into action 
And we have an excellent infrastructure meant for the poor 
But it has to be implemented 
So may be the Aware's role is to
explain to the people to utilise the infrastructure to make use of
the law for their own social transformation and economic betterment 
Do you mean to say that the infrastructure that the government
has created for the welfare of the backwards and the tribals your
organisation plays a key role into passing the benefits to the 
tribals and backwards ?
 Yeah 
The motivation explanation bringing the people near to the
government infrastructure asking them to fight for their rights 
asking them to utilise the existing infrastructure 
I will give an example there is a rural back in a village
And uh government has got four percent differential rate of
interest 
Nowhere in the world we've got such a infrastructure
But people goes go to a landlord and
take money for six and forty percent interest 
Why institution is there why people are not able to utilise it
Because people must know that institution is meant for them 
they have right to utilise that institution 
I ask these people I organise them to the bank educated
them 
Asked the bank to help them and I brought bank and people
together 
Landlord or the moneylender disappeared 
What can be the role of a voluntary organisation vis-a- vis
the government institutions ?
See nobody should ever come to a conclusion that voluntary
organisation is going to replace government
It is it is meaningless 
The voluntary organisations are always the forerunners the
pilots 
Who can experiment who build innovative programmes 
We can bring the people and government together 
So the role of voluntary organisation is a complementary and
supplimentary efforts of the government welfare programmes 
That should be the spirit of voluntary organisations 
Educate the people create awareness ask to utilise
government infrastructure 
Ask the government also to understand people 
So they must be catalyst between the people and government 
Your organisation Aware in how 
many states do you operate and how many villages are you covering ?
 We were work we started our work 
 in Andhra Pradesh 
So we are now in covering about two thousand three hundred
villages in Andra Pradesh 
About eight hundred villages in the neighbouring
Orissa
These are the two uh states where Aware 
is concentrating 
But we've got pilot projects in Kerala Tamil Nadu 
Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh 
May be shortly next year we may be starting our programme in
Manipur also 
But how do you decide that which village needs your
attention and where do you need to go to help the people ?
In the present area we're working in a
particular area 
So we're expanding literally like this because
 now Aware is a known organisation
Hundreds of villages are coming asking us to adopt 
But we don't work in an area more than eight years 
We withdraw make people themselves be free and indepenent
of Aware 
They have their own future
They must've their own plan and they should not
depend upon Aware 
Once we withdraw from thousand villages we expand to another
thousand villages 
Like that we're spreading 
In a place like Kerala and Tamil Nadu and other places 
where there are tribals because my organisation is working for
the tribal welfare and we are also including harijans 
also harijans and tribals are two communities whom
with whom we're working 
So wherever there is such people like in Uttar Pradesh 
there is a lot of child labour bounded labour 
 Mirjapur district where we are working 
Similarly in Vainad in in Kerala where tribals are there
So wherever the tribals are there where there condition is very
bad our organisation is trying to set up a project there 
Which one has been your singular achievement ?
When were you really touched by the apathy shown towards the
tribals and which you feel has been your achievement in the last
fifteen years ?
In nineteen seventy-five I have seen tribals are 
yoked to the tribals are tied to the tree and beaten black and blue 
And no law enforcing agency has two words 
One thing which I cannot forget is once when I was going 
I've seen two women yoked like a oxen and made to draw the water
from the well 
And I reach landlord and asked them why this is happening ?
 It's a cultural oppression he didn't had any feeling
for it 
He said yes 
And that among them one is a pregnant woman 
I thought if it is my mother and it is my sister what would have
 been happened ?
If landlord's mother and sister can he yoke like that
 ?
So that was a a very disturbing fact in my life 
Then I said no this cannot continue
This is our independent India and I what I thought is
 the poor people loss their dignity they are meek 
There is a conspiracy to keep them always poor by giving the
alcohol and other things 
So now let them discover their dignity 
Let them feel that they are equal citizens in this country 
That is where my motivation awareness creation training
camps mahasabhas all those thinkers made them to realise
 they are equal citizens of this country 
Today a tribal fifteen years ago a tribal used to run away
when he see saw me today he can reach the
gates of the Chief Minister and knock his door and ask him to hear
his problems
 That's the greatest satisfaction for me
Do you feel a sense of pride when you realise that you have
been you've been able to give them this kind of sense of
dignity
I I do not say pride but I feel so happy so content in my
life perhaps I would have never achieved anything more than this 
Today a bonded labour who was beaten in my presence is the
president of mandal praja parishad what more I 
wanted want ?
For two years you led the life of a sanyasi 
 why did you give that up ?
See I thought I must find out some meaning in my life 
I thought spiritualism is one of the main 
So I became a monk and I was uh with monks 
I met a number of great people great mahatmas 
But what I found is they do not have any solution for poverty
and sufferings of the poor people 
They have some solutions which for your next life nobody has seen
it 
And I also thought many of these people are expression of
capitalist system 
The rich peoples agents 
I said no my precious life should not be wasted in these
debates
I must do something action 
That action must remove the suffering of the people 
That is what Swami Vivekananda said it 
Perhaps what Swami Vivekananda did I said I tried to
translate in action 
Uh what role what is the role of women when uh uh 
they are the receiving and when they are trying to get the fruits of
development ?
See always in the in the development woman was kept as a
second rate citizen 
 It's very unfortunate 
But I learnt many things from the women themselves in my own
project area 
To be very frank in Aware women are the
 leaders of programme 
 I'll give one example 
Always government is giving some money 
 Aware is also giving some money 
Banks are giving some money 
So I spoke to uh a few women I told how long you are going
to recieve the money can't you create money among yourselves 
The discussion went on for two hours 
And they came out with a small programme which was very very
encouraging 
They call it as chitanya nidhi's 
programme 
Each one of them pay five rupees in a week 
and fifteen must become one unit 
And then two hundred and fifty they collect I give two
fifty
Out of five hundred rupees four fifty is given to
one woman as a loan which she pay back next week 
Like that in thirty seven weeks the so called poor woman
 could collect one crore forty seven lakhs rupees
 
So you can see the poor is only our term 
Poor is potential and they could keep such a money and
then it is revolved among them 
Thirty-seven five hundred women are beneficiary of this programme
today 
India is rich in human resources 
 We've so much of talent amongst ourselves 
Now having worked for fifteen years what do you think should be
done so that more and more villages are drawn into this kind of 
development process
It is my emotional feeling always India cannot be a
poor country 
With eight hundred and twenty million people we must be richest
people 
What is happening is the human resource is not planned 
developed and utilised 
We are always thinking of the economics money material 
matter 
But this so called rich resource we've got has to
be utilised
So perhaps my next to ten years work is I'm 
going to plan in one block or one samiti where all human
resource will be planned utilised and developed so that that block
must be self-sufficient 
So budgeting human resource is one of the important thing
We must take uh into notice in the our planning 
If somebody wants to join your voluntary organisation how
does one do that ?
Welcome 
We we always like people
There are a number of people who support Aware
 
Friends of Aware members of Aware
 
And we've an ideology like this where through
awareness development is brought and unless development is a 
people's movement development has no relevance 
Or if the development is meant for the people or poor and
poor must be the captains of the development 
These are all our expectations 
In another thing in Aware uh we always
think this alcohol is a conspiracy to keep the poor people always poor
What is the full meaning of Aware ?
 Aware stands for action for welfare and
awakening in rural environment 
Do you want to confine yourself only to the rural areas or
work for the poor in the urban areas as well ?
For last fifteen years we worked only in rural areas 
Now we thought it is also necessary to get solidarity of the urban
poor to support
You see today our country is passing through a transition 
 The already for last twenty years ten percent of the
rural population migrated to the urban areas 
And urban areas is not our culture 
Rural civilisation is our culture 
So in order to prevent urbanisation slums and other problems
 we want to take care of the people in urban area itself developing
the rural people
So next year we may perhaps move into little bit into
urban area where poor people comes and migrates and struggle for
their life 
What is your dream regarding these people what do they 
you really want them to become ?
What do you want to see ?
In my life I would like to see the whole of this caste
system which is conspiring to the society's underdevelopment
to be removed 
Where a tribal a harijan or a 
brahmin or anybody are equal equally share the responsibility of
governance of this country 
And my dream is Mahatma Gandhi's dream a 
gram swaraj 
Village that stands on its own leg and its own self-
sufficiency 
I believe in Mahatma's per 
perfect theory of making a village a gram swaraj
 that was my dream
Well Mr Madhavan's dream is also that of a 
gram swaraj the same as Mahatma Gandhi's 
We wish him all luck in his endeavours 
Thank you for being with us
Thank you
