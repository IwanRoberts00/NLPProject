He was born to a wealthy landlord 
""
""
Planning Commission 
""
But he soon realised that the fruits of planning and development did
""
""
He was disillusioned 
""
His restless soul drove him to the solitary solitude of the
""
""
But even the life of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He is P K S Madhavan 
""
""
""
""
voluntary organisation he set up from him 
""
""
 ?
""
""
In nineteen seventy-five  when I moved into Andhra Pradesh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
reached people 
""
And ten years we made all efforts to see that these people come up
""
""
""
""
Millions of 
""
Why people are not responding  ?
""
And I discovered  not part
""
""
So I thought writing a book is an intellectual exploitation 
""
""
to benefit out of it 
""
""
""
""
will decide their future 
""
""
""
""
""
""
development really reached the people  ?
""
""
You see when I  I
""
""
""
And about thirty percent of the money has gone  by middle man
""
""
""
""
So I felt atleast seven percent reached 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Where they live  ?
""
What their future  ?
""
So 
for any development
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
at me 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
stories to the children meeting the women  elderly
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In the beginning I was talking  with the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ramayana 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Simply discussing 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
our country is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What government infrastructure 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But it has to be implemented 
""
So may be the  to
""
""
""
""
""
has created  your
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The motivation  explanation bringing the people near to the
government infrastructure 
asking them to utilise the existing infrastructure 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because people must know 
""
""
I ask these people  educated
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See nobody should ever come to a conclusion that voluntary
""
""
It is 
""
The voluntary organisations are always the forerunners  the
""
""
Who can experiment 
""
We can bring the people and government together 
""
So the role of voluntary organisation is a complementary and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ask the government also to understand people 
""
So they must be catalyst between the people 
""
""
Your organisation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is concentrating 
""
But 
""
""
May be shortly next year we may be starting our programme in
Manipur also 
""
""
But how do you decide that which village  needs your
""
""
""
In the present area  working in a
""
""
So  because
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
depend upon 
""
""
thousand villages 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
there is a lot of child labour 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
bad 
""
""
""
""
""
tribals  which you feel has been your achievement in the last
""
""
""
In nineteen seventy-five I have seen 
""
""
""
""
""
I've  and made to draw the water
from the well 
""
And I reach landlord and asked them why this is happening  ?
""
 he didn't had any feeling
""
""
""
""
""
""
I thought if it is my mother and it is my sister what would have
 ?
""
If  yoke like that
""
""
""
""
Then I said no  this cannot continue
""
""
""
""
There is a conspiracy to keep them always poor  by giving the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
camps  all those thinkers made them to realise
""
""
Today  fifteen years ago a tribal used to run away
""
gates of the Chief Minister  and ask him to hear
""
""
 the greatest satisfaction for me
""
""
""
""
dignity
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
wanted  ?
""
""
For two years you led the life of a 
""
""
""
See I thought I must find out some meaning in my life 
""
""
""
""
""
I met a number of great people 
""
""
But what I found is  they do not have any solution for poverty
""
""
They have some solutions which for your next life nobody has seen
""
""
""
""
""
The rich peoples agents 
""
I said no  in these
""
""
I must do something action 
""
""
""
That is what Swami Vivekananda said 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
development  ?
""
""
""
second rate citizen 
""
""
""
But I learnt many things from the women themselves in my own
""
""
To be very frank in  women are the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Banks are giving some money 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And they came out with a small programme which was very very
encouraging 
""
""
""
""
""
and fifteen must become one unit 
""
""
fifty
""
Out of five hundred  four fifty is given to
one woman as a loan 
""
Like that in  the so called poor woman
 rupees
""
""
So you can see the poor 
""
""
then it is revolved among them 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
done so that more and more villages are drawn into this kind of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We are always thinking of the economics money 
""
""
But this so called rich  has to
""
""
So perhaps my next 
going to plan in one block or one  where all human
resource will be planned  that block
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
does one do that  ?
""
""
Welcome 
""
We we always like people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
awareness 
""
""
Or if the development is meant for the people  and
""
""
""
""
In another thing in  uh we always
""
""
""
""
""
""
 stands for action for welfare and
awakening in rural environment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ten percent of the
""
""
And urban areas is not our culture 
""
""
""
""
""
the rural people
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is your dream regarding these people what do they 
""
""
What do you want to see  ?
""
""
In my life I would like to see  the whole of this caste
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
gram swaraj 
""
""
sufficiency 
""
""
""
 that was my dream
