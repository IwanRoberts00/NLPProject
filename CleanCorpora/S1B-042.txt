He was born to a wealthy landlord 
""
He got good education  and got well-paid cosy job with the
Planning Commission 
""
But he soon realised that the fruits of planning and development did
not really reach the needy 
""
He was disillusioned 
""
His restless soul drove him to the solitary solitude of the
Himalayas 
""
But even the life of 
""
So he decided to go back to Andhra Pradesh to write a book on the
tribals 
""
But what he saw shocked him 
""
He saw woman being yoked instead of oxen 
""
Enough was enough he decided 
""
He gave up the idea of writing the book  and decided to work for
the welfare of the tribals 
""
He became their liberator 
""
He is P K S Madhavan 
""
""
""
 his experience and the
voluntary organisation he set up from him 
""
Mr Madhavan could you tell us about this volantary organisation
 ?
""
""
In nineteen seventy-five  when I moved into Andhra Pradesh
""
""
I did a small research in one block where about five thousand
tribals  in a
government programme 
""
And once our former Prime Minister was telling only twelve percent
of the money reached people 
""
My research in that particular block  I found only two percent
reached people 
""
And ten years we made all efforts to see that these people come up
""
""
But I found that why this is happening  ?
""
Millions of 
""
Why people are not responding  ?
""
And I discovered  not part
of implementation 
""
So I thought writing a book is an intellectual exploitation 
""
I get my name  doctorate but people are not going
to benefit out of it 
""
So I said 
""
 so that they
will decide their future 
""
So with that intention I started this organisation  AWARE
""
""
""
How did you realise that only two percent of the planning and
development really reached the people  ?
""
""
You see when I  I
found out sixty-two percent has gone to maintain the administration
bureaucracy and other things 
""
And about thirty percent of the money has gone  by middle man
""
""
Seven percent of this money reached poor people 
""
So I felt atleast seven percent reached 
""
When I investigated five percent of this money was  misused by
the people themselves 
""
So only two percent reached people 
""
So this is the fate of our planning and implementation 
""
Then what will happen to our country  ?
""
So I said why this is happening  ?
""
People must be able to know what they wanted  ?
""
Where they live  ?
""
What their future  ?
""
So 
for any development
""
""
How did you make people participate in your ventures  ?
""
How did you draw out the meek tribals into your  work ?
""
""
In the beginning people did not trust me
""
Because  talking a
different language  did not believe me at all
""
In some place there was an opposition 
""
People 
""
In one village they  to shoot
at me 
""
But persuasion continuous meeting  and
motivation has helped me  to people to
understand there is a man who is talking about them  and trying to help
them 
""
So that is how I just  and also I used telling the
stories to the children meeting the women  elderly
people 
""
Slowly I became friend of them 
""
""
How do you communicate with the tribals  ?
""
""
In the beginning I was talking  with the
""
""
Normally a vested interest their opinion maker 
""
Slowly slowly when I was able to observe  their
problems 
""
Childrens were first my media 
""
When elderly people 
Ramayana 
Mahabharata 
""
Some of the stories of  tribal culture
""
That is how I became friend with them 
""
And I never expected anything from them 
""
I never asked them to do anything 
""
Simply discussing 
""
So slowly they took me as a friend  and then they started
telling their problems 
""
""
What was your first impression of tribals when you really met
them in nineteen seventy-five  ?
""
""
You see my  assessment of this poverty in
our country is 
""
And always people think by giving money  poverty can be removed
""
It is not true 
""
To remove the poverty what we need is courage  psychological
make up 
""
And among the tribals they are meek  they are afraid of the new
people  and they are very
traditional 
""
And even the small communicators were exploiters 
""
So as a result they did not respond to the real development of our
country
""
""
And what is their state now  ?
""
""
Now after fifteen years  one
word  what we have done is to
explain to the people what government is doing for them 
""
What government infrastructure 
""
Infact in the whole of the world  our country has got an
excellent legislation 
""
Always in favour of poor 
""
Our constitution our legislations always in favour of poor 
""
But this has to be translated into action 
""
And we have an excellent infrastructure meant for the poor 
""
But it has to be implemented 
""
So may be the  to
explain to the people  to make use of
the law 
""
""
Do you mean to say that the infrastructure that the government
has created  your
organisation plays a 
tribals  and backwards ?
""
""
""
""
""
The motivation  explanation bringing the people near to the
government infrastructure 
asking them to utilise the existing infrastructure 
""
I will give an example  in a village
""
""
And uh  government has got four percent differential rate of
interest 
""
Nowhere in the world  got such a infrastructure
""
""
But people  and
take money for six and forty percent interest 
""
Why institution is there  why people are not able to utilise it
""
""
Because people must know 
they have right to utilise that institution 
""
I ask these people  educated
them 
""
Asked the bank to help them  and I brought bank and people
together 
""
Landlord or the moneylender disappeared 
""
""
What can be the role of a voluntary organisation vis-a- vis
the government institutions  ?
""
""
See nobody should ever come to a conclusion that voluntary
organisation is going to replace government
""
It is 
""
The voluntary organisations are always the forerunners  the
pilots 
""
Who can experiment 
""
We can bring the people and government together 
""
So the role of voluntary organisation is a complementary and
supplimentary 
""
That should be the 
""
Educate the people  ask to utilise
government infrastructure 
""
Ask the government also to understand people 
""
So they must be catalyst between the people 
""
""
Your organisation 
many  states do you operate and how many villages are you covering ?
""
""
""
""
""
So we are now in  covering about two thousand three hundred
villages 
""
About eight hundred villages  the neighbouring
Orissa
""
These are the two 
is concentrating 
""
But 
Karnataka 
""
May be shortly next year we may be starting our programme in
Manipur also 
""
""
But how do you decide that which village  needs your
attention and where do you need to go to help the people ?
""
""
In the present area  working in a
particular area 
""
So  because
 is a known organisation
""
Hundreds of villages are coming 
""
But we don't work in an area more than eight years 
""
We withdraw  and indepenent
of 
""
They have their own future
""
They  and they should not
depend upon 
""
Once we withdraw from thousand villages we expand to another
thousand villages 
""
Like that 
""
In a place like Kerala and 
where there are tribals  for
the tribal welfare 
also  communities whom
with whom 
""
So wherever there is such people 
there is a lot of child labour 
""
""
""
Similarly in Vainad in  where tribals are there
""
""
So wherever the tribals are there where there condition is very
bad 
""
""
Which one has been your singular achievement  ?
""
When were you really touched by the  apathy shown towards the
tribals  which you feel has been your achievement in the last
fifteen years  ?
""
""
In nineteen seventy-five I have seen 
yoked to the 
""
And no law enforcing agency has 
""
One thing which I cannot forget is once when I was going 
I've  and made to draw the water
from the well 
""
And I reach landlord and asked them why this is happening  ?
""
 he didn't had any feeling
for it 
""
He said 
""
And that among them one is a pregnant woman 
""
I thought if it is my mother and it is my sister what would have
 ?
""
If  yoke like that
 ?
""
So that was a a very disturbing fact in my life 
""
Then I said no  this cannot continue
""
This is our independent India  what I thought is
""
""
There is a conspiracy to keep them always poor  by giving the
alcohol 
""
So now let them 
""
Let them feel that they are equal citizens in this country 
""
That is where my motivation  training
camps  all those thinkers made them to realise
""
""
Today  fifteen years ago a tribal used to run away
when he  today he can reach the
gates of the Chief Minister  and ask him to hear
his problems
""
 the greatest satisfaction for me
""
""
Do you feel a sense of pride when you realise that you have
been  been able to give them this kind of sense of
dignity
""
""
I I do not say pride but I feel so happy  so content in my
life 
""
Today a bonded labour  is the
president of 
wanted  ?
""
""
For two years you led the life of a 
 ?
""
""
See I thought I must find out some meaning in my life 
""
I thought spiritualism is one of the main 
""
So I became a monk and I was 
""
I met a number of great people 
""
""
But what I found is  they do not have any solution for poverty
and sufferings of the poor people 
""
They have some solutions which for your next life nobody has seen
it 
""
And I also thought many of these people are expression of
capitalist system 
""
The rich peoples agents 
""
I said no  in these
debates
""
I must do something action 
""
That action must remove the suffering of the people 
""
That is what Swami Vivekananda said 
""
Perhaps what Swami Vivekananda did  I tried to
translate in action 
""
""
Uh what role what is the role of women 
they are the receiving and when they are trying to get the fruits of
development  ?
""
""
See always in the in the development  woman was kept as a
second rate citizen 
""
""
""
But I learnt many things from the women themselves in my own
project area 
""
To be very frank in  women are the
""
""
""
""
Always government is giving some money 
""
""
""
Banks are giving some money 
""
So I spoke to  I told how long you are going
to recieve the money 
""
The discussion went on for two hours 
""
And they came out with a small programme which was very very
encouraging 
""
They call it as 
programme 
""
Each one of them pay five 
and fifteen must become one unit 
""
And then  I give two
fifty
""
Out of five hundred  four fifty is given to
one woman as a loan 
""
Like that in  the so called poor woman
 rupees
""
""
So you can see the poor 
""
Poor is potential  and
then it is revolved among them 
""
Thirty-seven five hundred women are beneficiary of this programme
today 
""
""
India is rich in human resources 
""
""
""
Now having worked for fifteen years what do you think should be
done so that more and more villages are drawn into this kind of 
development process
""
""
It is my emotional  India cannot be a
poor country 
""
With eight hundred and twenty million people we must be richest
people 
""
What is happening is 
developed and utilised 
""
We are always thinking of the economics money 
matter 
""
But this so called rich  has to
be utilised
""
So perhaps my next 
going to plan in one block or one  where all human
resource will be planned  that block
must be self-sufficient 
""
So  budgeting human resource is one of the important thing
""
We must take 
""
""
If somebody wants to join your voluntary organisation  how
does one do that  ?
""
""
Welcome 
""
We we always like people
""
There are a number of people who support  Aware
""
""
Friends of  Aware
""
""
And  through
awareness 
people's 
""
Or if the development is meant for the people  and
poor must be the captains of the development 
""
These are all our expectations 
""
In another thing in  uh we always
think this alcohol is a conspiracy to keep the poor people always poor
""
""
What is the full meaning of  ?
""
""
 stands for action for welfare and
awakening in rural environment 
""
""
Do you want to confine yourself only to the rural areas or
work for the poor in the urban areas as well ?
""
""
For last fifteen years we worked only in rural areas 
""
Now we thought it is also necessary to get solidarity of the urban
poor  to support
""
You see today our country is passing through a transition 
""
 ten percent of the
rural population migrated to the urban areas 
""
And urban areas is not our culture 
""
Rural civilisation is our culture 
""
So in order to prevent urbanisation  slums and other problems
 developing
the rural people
""
So  little bit into
urban area  and struggle for
their life 
""
""
What is your dream regarding these people what do they 
you really want them to become  ?
""
What do you want to see  ?
""
""
In my life I would like to see  the whole of this caste
system  underdevelopment
to be removed 
""
Where a tribal 
brahmin  equally share the responsibility of
governance of this country 
""
And my dream is Mahatma 
gram swaraj 
""
Village that stands on its own  leg and its own self-
sufficiency 
""
I believe in 
perfect  gram swaraj
 that was my dream
""
""
Well Mr 
gram swaraj 
""
We wish him all luck in his endeavours 
""
Thank you for being with us
""
""
Thank you
