<I>
I am S Nambirajan native Kalyanam district in Tamil
Nadu Tamil Nadu state 
My name is P Swamy I am from Coimbatore coastal
district in Tamil Nadu 
Well sir good morning how are you 
I am fine okay
How are you sir 
I am also very fine 
Uh did you go to the university 
Ah yes I went on uh twelfth uh June ninety-four
Uhm why
A speech to make
What was the speech did you enjoy 
Ah I did enjoy uhm actually sir 
Are you getting any letters from home 
Ah yes I got
What are these
I got three letters from home uh one from the family and
one and other two from friends
Ah yes from friend Mr Arun 
Ah yes he described me in his letter uhm 
why he couldn't come to this uh refresher programme
 Uhm 
Yes he seem you don't call single that isn't it
Ah yes you see he is a good company
Yes he is good 
Then uh what about our local political scene there do you know
anything 
I fear uh I don't know 
We are here for more than uh three weeks
Uhm 
So I'm not in a good position uhn to
 speak about the local politics of Tamil Nadu
 Uhn 
But I received a letter from my friend yesterday
Ahn 
He has told that there is ahn a hue and cry
over the reservation issue
 Ahn 
Ahn about what
For the entrance examination uh for uh admission in the
professional group in Tamil Nadu
Ah ha 
Now we have reduced the reservation from 
sixty-nine percent to fifty percent
 Ahn 
Above 
So all the political parties are opposing it and uh 
Uhm 
Uh agitating with uh in a vigorous way 
 oh ho 
So each and every party is uh having a bandh 
 everyday 
 Oh ho 
And you know the petition of student is 
ahn taking a serious turn half or so
 Ahn 
Are schools and colleges running there just now 
Actually they are running
Ahn 
Uh but now and then they closed because every
political party try to have a bandh on a particular
day
Ahn 
And the leader of the main opposition party Dr Karunanidhi
has also been arrested 
Ahn ahn 
And I don't know what about what happened to him afterward
whether they released him or not 
But something is wrong with the state of affairs in our
state 
What do you think sir about this election reservation in
Karnataka 
I think they should not have introduced it all of a sudden
They should have introduced it gradually 
Ahn 
Say sometimes it may affect the people 
Ahn 
Who who are aiming at something 
So they should have announced it earlier or 
they should have uh introduced the scheme in a gradual manner 
So that nobody will be affected 
 Ahn 
Ah uhm 
So you say that there should be a psychological preparation for
the people to accept this election
Yes yes certainly 
People are not prepared to accept it all of a sudden 
Because this people never expected that they would announce it
at this junction even when they call for investigation they did
not mention it clearly mention about anything 
After receiving all applications and fixing the date for
examination and all
Ahn 
And they come out with this announcement people will certainly
get scrabbled that is uh I think they wonder ahn
 would be criticised for it 
 Ahn 
Moreover the political parties are uh aiming at
Ahn 
Uh utilising response into in their favour
 yes
 For 
For their coming up
Role 
So there is no wonder there will be some concessions 
Will it be useful for common persons 
If so uh upto what extent 
I don't think uh it will not benefit much but anyhow 
 uhm some uh bright people have uh some chance to come up
But at the cost cost at the cost of uh the
downtrodden people 
 Uhm 
Will it be harmful if uh shall we say uh from
different uh as you say it is downtrodden people
Yes certainly it will affect some genuine cases 
If it is genuine cases we may accept it as common one
Yes 
But uh will it effect the nation as a whole 
No I don't think it will affect the nation
But uh ahn on the whole the people 
 ah uh to some extent ahn may be affected 
I think so 
 Ahn 
 Ah 
 Ahn 
Well uh in my opinion I think that this reservation
 uh quota 
Uhn 
Uhm should have uhm should be applied
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Only for this non skilled job 
No 
Then ahn once again the criteria of casteism will
come into scene you see 
 Ahn 
Uhm
The people who are employed in uh very luc 
lucarious job ahn they will become another upper class
And these people who are employed in skill work they will
become the lower class because ah uh the
casteism the origin of casteism was on that basis in the beginning
So once again we are going to that line 
So what I say is the people a particular community people who
were uh who were supressed ahn for generations
together and there is no harm in giving them some chances to come up and
uh this must be the main issue 
 Ahn 
 Ah 
 Ahn 
Uh I do accept it
Uhn 
Uh whereas skill is the only factor uhm
 uh which can make a nation uhm progress 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
But we have we have to do some sacrifice 
I accept all those things because the efficiency uh
intelligence everything is uhn a plus point 
But even then
 Uhn 
Uhn 
We have to do something for the ahn 
upliftment of these people 
And more important the people from upper caste should come
forward for that 
 Ahn 
Uhm 
Then only there will be 
But you see 
If we do that there will be social harmony there
will be a good understanding among the people 
But now a days it seems that it's working in the
opposite direction that percentage people when they have to get
some important post they don't think that it is for the benefit of the
society and they they think that its for their own benefit and all
 their personal gains 
You see sir some people say you know that is in
railways ahn and the post office sir
 Ahn 
Yes 
Uh that additions of uh the personnel in
those department yes have considerably gone down 
 yes only because of this uh reservation
 Yes 
 Yes 
Yeah true 
Unskilled people
Uhm they say it is baseless 
The unskilled people uh come to the top uh they ar
not in a position to cope uhm uh with the 
necessity uhm uhm uh towards high post or high rank
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm 
Uh so they say they say uh that standard of service
 uhm has gone down
 Uhm 
Instead of say uh that is the only resaon for the 
uh down coming of the services there are so many factors but to think
 to some extent it may be true true 
Because those people have not yet been given a chance to 
act in that capacity 
There are so many factors like that 
But outright we cannot say that all those people who come
under the uhm reservations are not being or inefficient
There are so many people they can they could uh shine like
anything 
Here in our case there are two such persons that belonging
to schedule caste
 Uhm 
Uhn
But both people were very efficient and they were uh 
upright they were honest they were intelligent and they were up to the
mark 
They their services were highly useful to the department
concerned
Yeah yeah
And those people when they left their post they left
with a good name good integrity everything 
So we cannot say that it is the main factor
Some people may say like that because you see railways and uh
postals were once upon a time dominated by a particular community 
Nobody will have entered that job L I C railways 
post office and banks 
Because I have got my own experience even though I came
 with a very good uh marks in the ten plus I was subject in 
English 
Though in both one word and three or four banks L
I C in the oil field ahn I requested them even though I
belong to a forward community I still didn't got get
 
Even though I belonged to a forward community I was oppressed
there because I do not belong I was not belonging to a particular
community that's the 
So I find that these people should be given some time now
but there should be a time limit 
And there should be some other issue 
Creamy layer should be avoided 
They should break brought to the they should be brought to the
 for a period like that 
This scheme was well I think 
And actually downtrodden people must be given some importance
That that's where we come uh we must also
 Ahn 
Ah yeah 
Uh I accept uh your point it helps us 
That means uhm as a poor nation 
uhm should strive forward and should thrust for the skill 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Skill is very very important I don't I don't deny it 
Uh only by using that skill that bring sense uh
we can make our nation strong also 
Yes I accept it
See as one thinker say India is a rich country but
with poor people 
But was it uh
Our natural resources must be exploited for which
 uh both uh intellectual skill and uh manual skill are
required 
 You see 
Yes yes it is true but our uh constitution makers
 they introduce all these things in the hope of some good deed
But you see our people are misusing it to some extent 
Because take this minority issue also minority 
like minority issue
 What what 
 Haan 
They were given protection in order to have a good
chance to come up here
Uhm
I mean in all aspect but most of the people are looking
for this originality moreover there is uh many people are misusing from
here self benefit 
And the people from those minority community are affected much
Only by that route constitution is affected 
For example educational institution are started by minority
community people but the teachers working there are not success like
anything they are remained as it is they are not given uh their
salaries they are not able to protest it that uh any treatment or
anything like that 
So the intention is good but the implementation is
something wrong 
So we must find some way of otherwise we cannot say that
the system is itself is fully wrong 
Thats my opinion 
 It's a nice opinion indeed 
Needs of the best one word but direction is one
Thats what is important I accept it 
Because when uh when we go through this uh experiences
 first hand informations we feel that our people are wherever
they go wherever they belong to which state they belong to which religion
they belong 
Most of the people think that everything should be placed for
their own purpose as to a draw that line 
Because it is the guidence of the politician
Yes certainly they are men
Yes they are now 
Now politics has become a profession once upon a time it
was a service to the people 
But now people think that it is also a kind of profession 
So all the people will say please others and make this
 their way 
 Right it's become a no capital one
word 
Yes certainly 
The capital which only the rowdys and goonda have
 that's all what else 
Okay sir it's a pleasure uh thank you
To chat with me 
What 
Thank you thank you 
Thank you
