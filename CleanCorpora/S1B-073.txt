""
""

They were prepared by the school and I have signed them  about
uh 
""
And they have been submitted  provident

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn  the person who were
supposed to  uh
I will  and the account
numbers will be given to 
""
As far as the payment is consent every  has
been given
""
As for the  contribution our contribution and all
that 
""
Uh and H M has been reminded to 
""
Then  have been informed uh about the
deposits and they have started functioning 
""
Now I am happy  uh for some years were
being held by Mrs uh  Mrs Darwekar
""
""
""
""
""
In the last two years she had become very flat 
in the last academic year for uh one term she didn't run at all 
""
So she used to give us uh hundred  per month
""
""
Uh she was running also on only two days 
""
But uh this  uh academy is running the classes uh in number of
 we use it only for
""
""
""
""
""
There is nothing wrong I tell you 
""
This is an institution
""
""
Nothing serious that
""
""
But you see we can get funds
""
""
Compensation
""
""
Like borrow steal  if it is necessary
steal you steal it
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah this is the
""
""
For building the institution  but not
to put in  pocket
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn this  Ambujaksan he runs classes in
""
""
He has got trained uh teachers  and he also has classes in
Bhandup 
""
Now Committee last time in the  discussion they said minimum
three thousand you should try to ask 
""
Now Vice- Chairman was here and uh 
""
He called him he said initial years  uh I don't know what is
the response 
""
So let me start by paying you two thousand five hundred  and
from next year uh we will see  how whether we can pay more
""
So  and the classes have started
and uh  already
registered
""
The classes  Saturday and Sunday without
affecting uh 
""
Then uh 
""
But we have not  uh uh still taken action and in due course we
will take action 
""
And uh
""
""
Uh I would I would suggest  one attitude
""
""
Uh in Fort area  there is one Sardarji he is
a good assembler 
""
Atleast last twenty years  in our whole building most of us
are using that assembled one 
""
Actually he makes the whole thing  for your
Voltas also  to them
""
And Voltas only puts their 
""
So therefore you can also consult Krishnan 
for the price and other thing  and only thing is known
devil is better 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No here  we have got quotations for about twenty thousand
""
""
Known people 
""
""
Known  and Voltas
is charging uh twenty-eight thousand plus taxes
""
""
And  a lot
""
""
The discussion was 
assembled persons  one year
guarantee is there 
""
Parts are also free  or whether we have to pay
""
Somehow I had not been able to 
""
""
It is free service 
""
""
""
""
""
That confirmation we wanted  committee wanted and that I
have not been able to do 
""
Uh so that is  uh we decided to
open the account 
""
Now little bit of background is necessary for  some members
office bearers are fully aware 
""
Now last year  according to the contract
 transfer their
share to 
""
Somehow we were not able to because bank didn't agree and  the
the 
""
Then uh  actually came
back to us after lot of correspondence and  we wrote finally a
letter in May 
cheque  that day all the office bearers were here and H
M was there
""
He brought the cheque according to the 
 four thousand or
twenty-five thousand
""
It is reflected in the account statement which is declared
""
""
