Well friends uh though I was not able to attend the
meeting I was in touch with the Secretary Vice- Chairman and also the
treasurer 
And suddenly our Treasurer had to I mean Vice-Chairman had to go
out of Bombay that too also within at a
short notice he had to go 
Therefore I told my views to the Secretary to carry on the
meeting because we have to hold one or two words meeting and
some urgent matters are there 
These are the views you carry it out and it will be in the
minutes it will be read and approved so that's what we've 
done 
So all of you approve the meeting minutes 
Yes one word 
Uh now 
Anything else uh yeah arising out of this
 Uh yeah 
The matters arising out of uh uh the meeting 
previous meeting 
Uh I have to inform that uh after the last meeting uh all
the necessary provident fund papers uh have been uh properly signed
They were prepared by the school and I have signed them about
uh twenty twenty-five days back 
And they have been submitted uh to the provident
fund commissioner or they are likely to be submitted because in
between 
 Provident fund 
 Two words 
Uhn they have been given uh to the person who were
supposed to uh assist us Mr Aute and uh by next month uh
I will be assure that it will be regularised and the account
numbers will be given to all the three schools 
As far as the payment is consent every pie has
been given
As for the teachers' contribution our contribution and all
that that has been done 
Uh and H M has been reminded to uh follow up 
Then Karate Classes uh have been informed uh about the
deposits and they have started functioning 
Now I am happy that actually dance uh for some years were
being held by Mrs uh Darwekar Mrs Darwekar
 Darwekar 
In the last two years she had become very flat and uh 
in the last academic year for uh one term she didn't run at all 
So she used to give us uh hundred rupees per month
 for the use of hall and uh electricity 
Uh she was running also on only two days 
But uh this uh academy is running the classes uh in number of
 institution we use it only for
 Institution 
There is nothing wrong I tell you 
This is an institution
Nothing serious that
But you see we can get funds
Compensation
Like borrow steal sometime if it is necessary
steal you steal it
 This is a 
Yeah this is the
For building the institution yeah and but not
to put in anybody's pocket
 Yeah and 
Uhn this now uh Mr Ambujaksan he runs classes in
 uh large number of schools here cough 
He has got trained uh teachers and he also has classes in
Bhandup and all that he had approached us 
Now Committee last time in the discussion they said minimum
three thousand you should try to ask 
Now Vice- Chairman was here and uh H M was here 
He called him he said initial years uh I don't know what is
the response 
So let me start by paying you two thousand five hundred and
from next year uh we will see how whether we can pay more
So it is uh or we have agreed and the classes have started
and uh parents uh some twenty thirty parents have already
registered
The classes are run on Saturday and Sunday without
affecting uh working of the school 
Then uh initially we have made the enquiry 
But we have not uh uh still taken action and in due course we
will take action 
And uh
Uh I would I would suggest uhm one attitude
Uh in Fort area uhm there is one Sardarji he is
a good assembler and uh good service also uhm uhm 
Atleast last twenty years in our whole building most of us
are using that assembled one uhm uhm 
Actually he makes the whole thing uhm for your
Voltas also have he has given yeah to them
And Voltas only puts their level endowing 
So therefore you can also consult Krishnan yeah 
for the price and other thing one word and only thing is known
devil is better than the unknown devil that's 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
No here we have got quotations for about twenty thousand
Known people 
Known uh both the both parties are known and Voltas
is charging uh twenty-eight thousand plus taxes
And that's a lot
The discussion was to find out from these uh 
assembled persons whether during the service which is free one year
guarantee is there 
Parts are also free or whether we have to pay
Somehow I had not been able to ask them 
It is free service minus the part 
 Include the part 
That confirmation we wanted committee wanted and that I
have not been able to do 
Uh so that is and this uh you see uh we decided to
open the account uh for computer education 
Now little bit of background is necessary for some members
office bearers are fully aware 
Now last year we had agreed uh according to the contract
 to collect the fees ourselves and uh then uh transfer their
share to the party 
Somehow we were not able to because bank didn't agree and the
the one word collected the fees 
Then uh we our contribution uh actually came
back to us after lot of correspondence and then uh we wrote finally a
letter in May asking the party to see us along with the 
cheque cheque and uh that day all the office bearers were here and H
M was there
He brought the cheque according to the cal 
 calculation it was about twenty four thousand or
twenty-five thousand
It is reflected in the account statement which is declared
 Cheque
