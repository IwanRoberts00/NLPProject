So I feel like going out and having some fresh air 
Ah that's true
And if I do some 
And walking is also good for health 
 walking yeah good exercise after
sitting whole day in the branch so better to walk around 
 That's true I've also
grown some backpain these days

come down during that time so that he can attend the marriage 
 accha and have fun at least
 Accha 
Yeah you're correct
