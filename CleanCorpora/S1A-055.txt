We don't come in contact with any of them 
All we learn about is anatomy physiology and bio-chemistry
These are for the first phase 
 These like other background for our 
future studies 
They have to commence 
 Uh 
They are preparing us before coming in contact with
patient 
This is the first phase 
This is the first phase then in the second phase we
have some clinical subjects in which we come in direct contact with the
patients ah but it's on two basis like when we see
the patients at the same time we study about the pathology only 
 ahm ahm the pathology and then we learn about some of the 
drugs which are to be which are used for their treatment 
 Ahm ahm 
And the last phase 
And the last phase we are in total contact with the
patients clinical completely clinical operated we'll 
be examining them diagonising them 
So it's more like a practical 
 It's more practical and then after we pass it
