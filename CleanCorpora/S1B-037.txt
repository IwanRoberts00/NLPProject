The  took place under some very very special
circumstances 
""
To what extent was this this  has the consent of
people of the state 
""
To what extent it has has the integration of the state into the
Union  being possible ?
""
And what have been the deficiency  uh process of
integration itself 
""
And perhaps  uh major question to which
we must  if we are ever to find the solution to
problems 
""
We could not have assembled a better panel of eminent expert 
""
To my left is Prof  a well known law scholar
 from Kashmir University
""
Who is currently associated with  New
Delhi 
""
To the left of him  a well known
constitutional expert and political scientist also from 
""
And  and
Director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and 
""
 and go back to the
whole  the accession itself before we come down to the
problems of 
""
At present it is it is uh the anniversary of uh  the accession
""
""
Professor Punjabi  to what
extent do you think  that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian
Union in October nineteen forty-seven  to what extent did it have the
consent of the 
""
""
Well you see this accession took place under various 
special and typical circumstances 
""
On fifteenth of August when two dominion came into existence that
India and Pakistan  struggling to have
""
""
They wanted to  end the autocratic rule of Maharaja Hari Singh
""
""
And uh  to speak
with someone 
""
And the struggle was going on 
""
Well in this Independence Act 
the the Prince State  India or Pakistan
""
""
But the Maharaj of Kashmir was undecided on this issue
""
He did not  he asked for time
""
In the mean time  agreement
 India wanted some time and some
clarifications 
""
In the mean time when  there
was suddenly a tribal attack  across the border of
Pakistan on Kashmir 
""
So this created a  whereby some
decision had to be taken 
""
But at the same time 
Maharaja 
""
There was  who had launched
the struggle in the state for say since nineteen thirty-one 
""
So therefore  uh the accession took place under these
circumstances 
""
""
Prof Ravindrakumar if I may just uh  get to you as a
Historian 
struggle in Jammu and Kashmir of the National Conference  of uh Sheikh
Abdullah  ?
""
I mean  is this placed
in the history of our freedom struggle 
""
In other words  I mean is there a link between the struggle that
was going on in Jammu and Kashmir  rest of
India  for liberation from British rule
""
""
Of course there is a very close and integral link
""
And  I would like to add one or two observations by way of foot
note to what 
""
I think the people of Jammu and Kashmir  under the leadership of
Sheikh Abdullah 
""
They were fighting the autocratic government  of the ruling
dynasty at the time  they were fighting the British
in Kashmir 
""
So that it was this dual struggle which was carried on under the
aegis of Sheikh Abdullah 
particular days 
""
I think it is important to remember that at the same time as 
the State acceeded to the Indian Union  under the
leadership of Sheikh Abdullah was created  in Shrinagar the capital of the
state of Jammu and Kashmir
""
So that  came to a successful
conclusion 
""
But uh it is also important to remember here that an assurance was
given 
""
As was true 
or Hyderabad 
would be backed at the later stage  by the
people of that state 
""
And I think this  truly
 as was done in subsequent years
""
""
Prof Bhambri uh  but don't you think I mean on the basis of
what  do you think that though something you
see over and above distance uh  there were
certain special circumstances  the other just explained
""
And I think  uhm perhaps you could throw some light on the fact
that you see Jammu and Kashmir was treated on a seperate footing  and the
certain assurances that were given which were legal enshrined  in a
special status for Jammu and Kashmir
""
In a sense 
""
Some argue that that is the root  of the problem
""
 say that this is something which would serve as a
model for the future 
""
Now where exactly do you think I mean what  uh was a
special feature  were both of
India as well as the constitution of the Jammu and Kashmir state  which
made  or ensured the special status for Jammu
and Kashmir 
""
""
Chander as Ravindra Riaz have very clear pointed out  that
instrument of accession was brought under special circumstances  to
provide first the  foundations to confront the tribal
raiders 
""
At the same time even at that very critical juncture the historical
developments of  was
ignored 
""
They were always kept uppermost in mind 
""
And once this raiders issue is resolved  and Kashmir
problem  but specifically in the
context of historical development  by the
constitutional makers of India  under article
three hundred seventy 
""
That is  and with limited
powers of the central government  especially on the defence and foreign
affairs  and
later on  as represented
by  Sheikh Abdullah of National Conference
""
""
And that constitution will provide them with the  beginning of
democratic involvement of Kashmir society as far as the  and a larger
problems of Indian polity of democracy 
""
Which was a construction of  as part
of  it was accomodation of
special history 
""
It was not a concession to call it even special 
""
Special means as a significant 
""
It was not a concesssion it was a very legitimate 
of the historically marked struggle 
""
And aspiration of people to be satisfied democratically 
""
And hence establishment of democratic polity in Kashmir  as a
first step  is under this constitution
""
""
I see that Riaz is getting impatient to  also
""
""
See I think uh  we would like to push we should I think
take note of two important things that one  when
the constitution of India was promolgated 
""
Now we have article one of the constitution of India which define
the critical situation of India
""
""
Right 
""
""
So by virtue of article one 
Jammu and Kashmir state was placed in a part B state 
""
Because there were A B C D four categories of states 
""
And Jammu and Kashmir fell in the category of part B state 
""
Uh that is those states which were not directly  uh cannot have
the impression  result of the
process 
""
And in nineteen fifty-six of course in category B state were
abolished so  Jammu and Kashmir state fell in the category of part A state
""
""
""
""
Second part of it article three seventy  which guarantee
special status under the 
""
Now 
precisely because that article one was being debated in the Constituent
Assembly 
""
Uh B R Ambedkar said that  there is one special feature about
article one Indian constitution that  Indian Union is not a volantary
union 
""
Secondly that  no unit has the right to secede from the Union
""
""
So keeping you  whether this
Jammu Kashmir state and the Indian Union  one
""
Second is this  the uh at the root
of the tension between the state leaders and union leaders  was the extent
of other constitutional 
""
Because  determining the relationship constitutional
relationship by means of article one 
""
Uh then just as this is quantum relationship 
""
But I think uh  was not fully
defined to what was the problem
""
I think there was 
as for as the quantum relationship is concerned 
""
You know because I 
very often that it is made important point of view often 
""
And I think that it is perhaps in this context then 
Corobel 
""
He was member of  UNCIP United Nation Commission India
and Pakistan 
""
He said  it is amazing that nobody ever raised this issue
before Security Council 
""
That is perhaps the  has report the article
one 
""
""
Sorry for 
""
The this question on article one in the Constitution not only by Dr
Ambedkar remaining others  also showed awareness of some of this
secessionist movement even healthy movement in other parts of the country
also 
""
So the assurance was given to everyone  including Jammu and
Kashmir the secessions 
""
""
Uhm yeah 
""
""
 I think this is an important
point the one which  making but I will also refer back to the
 question of Kashmir having a special status
""
""
I don't think Kashmir had any special status at all in the
sense that  state throughout the country there was an
understanding by the national status who came to power in  New Delhi on
the fifteenth of August  nineteen forty-seven
""
When the popular will  of those who live in the princely state
 uh article three seventy
went as far as saying  that in actual Constituent Assembly within the
framework of article one to really define the precise nature of the
relationship 
""
Finally I would think that when that Constituent Assembly made its
announcement  in nineteen fifty-two and fifty-three
""
Those announcement as  one
word  uh
announcement is not meant to be a static anouncement at all
""
It was seen as a revolving  situation
""
""
 transgressing my role as moderator but I can't do
not quite agree  observation on uh you know there have not
been a special status
""
Because after all you see article three seventy 
""
And  things that are enshrined in it uh
such as there being a separate uhm  constitution for Jammu and Kashmir
""
And some other  a
separate emblem  uh separate flag and uh
""
""
Of course
""
""
No  uh has was wasn't
concession it as I said earlier  uh many people argue
that this could serve as a model for for their for their future
""
There have been demands from other parts of the country  that
article three seventy should be extended to other places 
""
On the other hand there is other tendency which says that this 
is  three seventy is the root of this problem and because we had a
special  with the
main stream of India was never  uh complete
""
""
Chander uh
""
""
Uh how would you uh 
""
""
""
""
""
But I honestly want to say  you're
 misunderstanding my position
""
What  in the
declaration of the New Delhi leaders 
""
That the  voice would be consulted throughout the
region of princely states you know 
""
Of course  the very fact that a Constituent Assembly was given
to  uh a special
status but that special status doesnot at all consent 
of Kashmir and Jammu and Kashmir 
inter-media 
""
""
Of course  certainly not
""
But uh what the focus of  brought
perhaps I think you know  has come to see what
 uh happening in Kashmir over the last few years
""
Actually I think uhm  very sad because in a sense that
Kashmir  most Indians
""
And to see 
""
""
those committed to Democracy and federalism in this country 
""
And considering that those indeed certain special provision made
for Jammu and Kashmir 
""
Why ?
""
Why did this happen I mean 
really we went wrong
