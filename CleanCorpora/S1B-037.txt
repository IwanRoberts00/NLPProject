The  took place under some very very special
""
""
To what extent was this this  has the consent of
""
""
""
""
""
""
integration itself 
""
""
we must  if we are ever to find the solution to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
whole  the accession itself before we come down to the
""
""
At present it is it is uh the anniversary of uh  the accession
""
""
Professor Punjabi  to what
""
""
consent of the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  to speak
with someone 
""
""
""
Well in this Independence Act 
the the Prince State  India or Pakistan
""
""
But the Maharaj of Kashmir was undecided on this issue
""
""
""
In the mean time  agreement
""
clarifications 
""
""
was suddenly a tribal attack  across the border of
""
""
So this created a  whereby some
""
""
""
""
""
There was  who had launched
""
""
So therefore  uh the accession took place under these
""
""
""
Prof Ravindrakumar if I may just uh  get to you as a
""
struggle in Jammu and Kashmir of the National Conference  of uh Sheikh
""
""
I mean  is this placed
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They were fighting the autocratic government  of the ruling
dynasty at the time  they were fighting the British
""
""
So that it was this dual struggle which was carried on under the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh it is also important to remember here that an assurance was
""
""
""
""
""
people of that state 
""
""
""
""
""
Prof Bhambri uh  but don't you think I mean on the basis of
""
see over and above distance uh  there were
""
""
""
that you see Jammu and Kashmir was treated on a seperate footing  and the
certain assurances that were given which were legal enshrined  in a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Chander as Ravindra Riaz have very clear pointed out  that
""
""
""
""
""
developments of  was
""
""
They were always kept uppermost in mind 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
powers of the central government  especially on the defence and foreign
""
later on  as represented
""
""
""
""
democratic involvement of Kashmir society as far as the  and a larger
""
""
Which was a construction of  as part
""
""
""
""
""
Special means as a significant 
""
""
of the historically marked struggle 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
So by virtue of article one 
""
""
""
""
And Jammu and Kashmir fell in the category of part B state 
""
""
the impression  result of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Second part of it article three seventy  which guarantee
special status under the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
article one Indian constitution that  Indian Union is not a volantary
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of the tension between the state leaders and union leaders  was the extent
""
""
Because  determining the relationship constitutional
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Corobel 
""
""
and Pakistan 
""
He said  it is amazing that nobody ever raised this issue
before Security Council 
""
That is perhaps the  has report the article
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Kashmir the secessions 
""
""
Uhm yeah 
""
""
 I think this is an important
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh article three seventy
""
framework of article one to really define the precise nature of the
""
""
Finally I would think that when that Constituent Assembly made its
announcement  in nineteen fifty-two and fifty-three
""
""
word  uh
""
""
It was seen as a revolving  situation
""
""
""
not quite agree  observation on uh you know there have not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
concession it as I said earlier  uh many people argue
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
main stream of India was never  uh complete
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
declaration of the New Delhi leaders 
""
That the  voice would be consulted throughout the
""
""
""
to  uh a special
""
of Kashmir and Jammu and Kashmir 
""
""
""
""
""
But uh what the focus of  brought
perhaps I think you know  has come to see what
""
""
""
Kashmir  most Indians
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
for Jammu and Kashmir 
""
""
