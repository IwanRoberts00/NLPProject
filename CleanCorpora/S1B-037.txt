The accord took place under some very very special
circumstances 
To what extent was this this accession has the consent of
people of the state 
To what extent it has has the integration of the state into the
Union being possible ?
And what have been the deficiency in this uh process of
integration itself 
And perhaps uh to examine these uh major question to which
we must one word others if we are ever to find the solution to
problems that faces us uh in the state 
We could not have assembled a better panel of eminent expert 
To my left is Prof A R Punjabi a well known law scholar
 from Kashmir University
Who is currently associated with uh the JNU uh in New
Delhi 
To the left of him Prof C P Bhambri a well known
constitutional expert and political scientist also from JNU 
And to his left Prof Ravindra Kumar Historian and
Director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library New Dehli 
 Let's uh start at the beginning and go back to the
whole issue of the accession itself before we come down to the
problems of uh the present 
At present it is it is uh the anniversary of uh the accession
Professor Punjabi if I may put it to you this way to what
extent do you think that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian
Union in October nineteen forty-seven to what extent did it have the
consent of the people of the state 
Well you see this accession took place under various 
special and typical circumstances 
On fifteenth of August when two dominion came into existence that
India and Pakistan people of Kashmir were too struggling to have
 uh their own government 
They wanted to end the autocratic rule of Maharaja Hari Singh
And uh they want wanted to speak
with someone 
And the struggle was going on 
Well in this Independence Act provided the opportunity to 
the the Prince State to accede to the either domain India or Pakistan
But the Maharaj of Kashmir was undecided on this issue
He did not decide and uh he asked for time
In the mean time he asked for a one word agreement
 which was agreed to uh Pakistan and India wanted some time and some
clarifications 
In the mean time when all these things were going on there
was suddenly a tribal attack from the across the border of
Pakistan on Kashmir 
So this created a one word situation whereby some
decision had to be taken and uh states defence was involved 
But at the same time it was not the question of 
Maharaja alone 
There was a very popular political party who had launched
the struggle in the state for say since nineteen thirty-one 
So therefore uh the accession took place under these
circumstances 
Prof Ravindrakumar if I may just uh get to you as a
Historian how do you uh visualize in this prospect the 
struggle in Jammu and Kashmir of the National Conference of uh Sheikh
Abdullah ?
I mean ho where is this placed
in the history of our freedom struggle 
In other words I mean is there a link between the struggle that
was going on in Jammu and Kashmir and the struggle in rest rest of
India for liberation from British rule
Of course there is a very close and integral link
And I would like to add one or two observations by way of foot
note to what my friend Riaz has already said in this regard 
I think the people of Jammu and Kashmir under the leadership of
Sheikh Abdullah were fighting on two fronts 
They were fighting the autocratic government of the ruling
dynasty at the time and the same time they were fighting the British
in Kashmir as do the rest of South Asia 
So that it was this dual struggle which was carried on under the
aegis of Sheikh Abdullah and the National Conference party of those 
particular days 
I think it is important to remember that at the same time as 
the State acceeded to the Indian Union a popular government under the
leadership of Sheikh Abdullah was created in Shrinagar the capital of the
state of Jammu and Kashmir
So that both the struggles in a way came to a successful
conclusion 
But uh it is also important to remember here that an assurance was
given by the uh government in New Delhi 
As was true in the case of all sub-states say like Junagadh 
or Hyderabad that the will that the decision of the ruler 
would be backed at the later stage by an expression of will by the
people of that state 
And I think this in a way would make the accession truly
 one word and truly firm as was done in subsequent years
Prof Bhambri uh but don't you think I mean on the basis of
what uh Ravindra just said do you think that though something you
see over and above distance uh accession in human history there were
certain special circumstances which uh the other just explained
And I think uhm perhaps you could throw some light on the fact
that you see Jammu and Kashmir was treated on a seperate footing and the
certain assurances that were given which were legal enshrined in a
special status for Jammu and Kashmir
In a sense give a very special status to the state 
Some argue that that is the root of the problem
 I'll say that this is something which would serve as a
model for the future 
Now where exactly do you think I mean what uh if uh was a
special feature that were enshrined in the constitution were both of
India as well as the constitution of the Jammu and Kashmir state which
made the the special status or ensured the special status for Jammu
and Kashmir 
Chander as Ravindra Riaz have very clear pointed out that
instrument of accession was brought under special circumstances to
provide first the one word foundations to confront the tribal
raiders 
At the same time even at that very critical juncture the historical
developments of the content of struggle in a few words was
ignored 
They were always kept uppermost in mind 
And once this raiders issue is resolved Jammu and Kashmir
problem not special not particular but specifically in the
context of historical development would be taken care of by the
constitutional makers of India which were enshrined under article
three hundred seventy 
That is the provisions of accessions and with limited
powers of the central government especially on the defence and foreign
affairs would be taken of care of by central government and
later on the democrate forces in Jammu and Kashmir as represented
by the popular leaders under Sheikh Abdullah of National Conference
 would through their own democratic process form a constitution 
And that constitution will provide them with the beginning of
democratic involvement of Kashmir society as far as the and a larger
problems of Indian polity of democracy 
Which was a construction of democratic technique as part
of constitutional one or two word it was accomodation of
special history 
It was not a concession to call it even special 
Special means as a significant one word 
It was not a concesssion it was a very legitimate one word 
of the historically marked struggle 
And aspiration of people to be satisfied democratically 
And hence establishment of democratic polity in Kashmir as a
first step is under this constitution
I see that Riaz is getting impatient to one word also
See I think uh we would like to push we should I think
take note of two important things that one in nineteen fifty when
the constitution of India was promolgated 
Now we have article one of the constitution of India which define
the critical situation of India
Right 
So by virtue of article one of Indian constitution 
Jammu and Kashmir state was placed in a part B state 
Because there were A B C D four categories of states 
And Jammu and Kashmir fell in the category of part B state 
Uh that is those states which were not directly uh cannot have
the impression of paramouncy but uh while the result of the
process of integration 
And in nineteen fifty-six of course in category B state were
abolished so Jammu and Kashmir state fell in the category of part A state
 That's one part of it 
Second part of it article three seventy which guarantee
special status under the one word 
Now as far as article one and is concerned uhm 
precisely because that article one was being debated in the Constituent
Assembly 
Uh B R Ambedkar said that there is one special feature about
article one Indian constitution that Indian Union is not a volantary
union 
Secondly that no unit has the right to secede from the Union
So keeping you in mind that have article one whether this
Jammu Kashmir state and the Indian Union one
Second is this what became perhaps the uh at the root
of the tension between the state leaders and union leaders was the extent
of other constitutional one word 
Because after determining the relationship constitutional
relationship by means of article one of the Indian Constitution 
Uh then just as this is quantum relationship 
But I think uh the quantum relationship was not fully
defined to what was the problem
I think there was some difference of perception as well 
as for as the quantum relationship is concerned 
You know because I I'm refering to article one because 
very often that it is made important point of view often 
And I think that it is perhaps in this context then George 
Corobel wrote the book uh Danger in Kashmir 
He was member of UNCIP United Nation Commission India
and Pakistan 
He said it is amazing that nobody ever raised this issue
before Security Council either India or Pakistan 
That is perhaps the two words has report the article
one one was recognised 
Sorry for minor interruption 
The this question on article one in the Constitution not only by Dr
Ambedkar remaining others also showed awareness of some of this
secessionist movement even healthy movement in other parts of the country
also especially North-East India 
So the assurance was given to everyone including Jammu and
Kashmir the secessions are rejected 
Uhm yeah but it is not 
 Yeah I I think I think this is an important
point the one which you're making but I will also refer back to the
 question of Kashmir having a special status
I don't think Kashmir had any special status at all in the
sense that one word state throughout the country there was an
understanding by the national status who came to power in New Delhi on
the fifteenth of August nineteen forty-seven
When the popular will of those who live in the princely state
 would be affected in the case of Kashmir uh article three seventy
went as far as saying that in actual Constituent Assembly within the
framework of article one to really define the precise nature of the
relationship between Kashmir and the rest of the Indian Union 
Finally I would think that when that Constituent Assembly made its
announcement in nineteen fifty-two and fifty-three
Those announcement as has been suggested by Riaz and one
word Shah but two words developing and changing uh
announcement is not meant to be a static anouncement at all
It was seen as a revolving situation
 I'm transgressing my role as moderator but I can't do
not quite agree what your observation on uh you know there have not
been a special status
Because after all you see article three seventy 
And you see from the things that are enshrined in it uh
such as there being a separate uhm constitution for Jammu and Kashmir
And some other some symbol of uh that that is there a
separate emblem uh separate flag and uh
Of course
No no I think you see these were uhm uh has was wasn't
concession it as I said earlier see this could uh many people argue
that this could serve as a model for for their for their future
There have been demands from other parts of the country that
article three seventy should be extended to other places 
On the other hand there is other tendency which says that this 
is three seventy is the root of this problem and because we had a
special relationship with Kashmir the integration of Kashmir with the
main stream of India was never uh complete
Chander uh
Uh how would you uh a few words 
 A few words 
But I honestly want to say ke you're
 misunderstanding my position
What I'm saying is the communality lay in the
declaration of the New Delhi leaders 
That the people's voice would be consulted throughout the
region of princely states you know 
Of course the very fact that a Constituent Assembly was given
to the people of Jammu and Kashmir means giving them uh a special
status but that special status doesnot at all consent that the place 
of Kashmir and Jammu and Kashmir within the Indian Union or the 
inter-media 
Of course certainly certainly not
But uh what the focus of uh what we've brought
perhaps I think you know is the time we suspect has come to see what
 we've seen as uh happening in Kashmir over the last few years
Actually I think uhm very very sad because in a sense that
Kashmir uh state have a special place in the heart of most Indians
And to see what's happened to the Valley 
 It's something which you know pain all uh 
those committed to Democracy and federalism in this country 
And considering that those indeed certain special provision made
for Jammu and Kashmir 
Why ?
Why did this happen I mean what where 
really we went wrong
