 Accha 
Yeah one of them writes letters to the newspaper
 Accha 
And they are regularly published in the newspaper
And others think you write
Yeah some people think those who don't know my

 Yeah 
Ah 
So there was a uh Indian Express was
starting its edition 
Ah
So they had called or 
They were starting the edition in Bombay or Poona ?
Poona Poona 
 Poona yes 
So they called uh students from our department
Yes 
For the written exam
Right 
After those who were qualified for that were called for an
interview
Yes 
And interview was conducted by uh you want all
that 
Yes yes
It was conducted by the now one word Mr Kardale
 and one Patanjali Shetty
Yes 
So they said whether we would like to do sports
reporting
Yes 
So I was keen on that also
Uhm 
So then after that uh after a month or so they said
that they are taking as reporter here in Pune yes 
 Indian Express 
 Yes 
Uhm 
But that was uh they wanted me to join before my
exams
Yeah 
So I joined in April nineteen ninety nineteen 
eighty-eight 
So till nineteen eighty-eight you join Indian
Express 
Yeah
Yeah 
As a trainee reporter
Yeah 
May first to fifteenth I took leave yes for
the exams
 Yes 
Ah
So I gave my exam during that time
Right 
Then I joined back
Ah 
Then what and the next thing was my result
Yes 
I got a first class
Right 
Then in October eighty-eight I married
Yes 
So after marriage Sudha went to Bombay
Yes
So she got a 
 Job 
 I also and that that time Indian
Express was short of people in Bombay
Yes 
So for their desk ah Pune desk
 Ah 
Yes 
So I asked for a transfer ah and I was
given it immedietly
 Ah 
Yes
So I went there
But Sudha had gone over to Bombay earlier
Yeah earlier 
And how long were you alone in Poona ?
Poona I would have been alone for say 
Two three months 
No one month
Just one month
Yeah within one month I managed everything
Yes 
Okay so
Ah
October fifth we married
Ah 
By November tenth I was in Bombay
Ah 
So 
Ah 
Then I joined the desk there ah as a
sub-editor
 Ah 
Yes 
And at the Pune desk
Right
And uh then Sudha got a job in Free Press
Yes
And I was conf I went on probation in
November itself
That is after your pe period as trainee
journalist you were on probation 
 Probation 
Yes and provisional period was how long ?
Three months 
Three months
Yeah
Yeah and after completing the
 Two or three months I'm not sure about
it
Yes 
So after completing probation I became permanent
Yeah 
But on the desk the problem was later on it came
that Pune edition unit every one will go for night shifts 
Yes
Some seven O'clock till twelve O'clock 
everyday 
That means everyday you would have been require
to 
 Everyday we have to do only that particular
shift only
Yeah 
Because they didn't need for anything else
Yes
So I ask for a transfer to the Bombay desk
Ah 
So when I went to the Bombay desk uh they put me on
two shifts
one was the mid shift that is on two O'clock to eight 
O'clock yeah and alternate we had night and this mid
shift
 Yeah 
Yes 
So that was also getting quite boring laughter
 so I wanted to shift to that uh reporting
Yeah 
So at that time I was
I think right from the begining your main interest was
reporting
Yeah reporting
Not desk
But I had gone to Bombay because 
Yeah because you wanted the transfer to Bombay
Yeah that's right 
 That's why you accepted the desk
Yeah that's right
And I was not very su uh knowledgeble about all
this that it was difficult to shift from desk to reporting
Right
So at that time I had written some sports copies from
here from Pune for Indian Express 
Yeah 
They had a sports uh suppliment yeah 
extra sport it was called
 Yeah 
Yeah 
So Rajanbala was handling that and he knew I had written
and uhm he had liked couple of thesis
 Uhm 
Yeah
So when I was in Bombay he just came to know that I was
there uhm and said Why don't you join the sports desk
 ?
 Uhm 
Yeah 
So I put in an application uhn to the
news editor saying that I want to join the sports desk
 Uhn 
Yeah
But they wouldn't leave me because they were short of
staff on the desk as well as they didn't want anyone moving from
there
Yeah
All petty yeah politics
 Yeah 
Politics 
So I then he said no you have just come 
No no was there politics between the say those
who I mean the person who are in charge of sports desk and
Yeah yeah there is lots of politics
 Accha 
Uh uh
Although they had equal rank 
Equal rank but they never let you like you don't give
your personal interest
I see ah
You know that sort
So you hold on to the persons who are working with you
Yeah you hold on to the person for your ego problem 
 yeah as well as staff shortage also
 Yeah 
Yeah 
And moreover you don't see eye to eye with the other 
laughter yeah 
Yeah
Basically because of that
Uhm 
Then he said at that time ke wait for five
six months you have just joined then I will consider it 
So I waited for six months and again I put an application
Yeah 
So he said no at that time the new R A had com
 complained the converse haan so he
directed it the application back to the news editor who said no
 Haan 
Ah
So it was getting too much 
Yes 
For one month I just didn't go to office laughter 
Without informing them 
Without informing them
Yeah
And I made the rounds of all the newspaper offices down
 there 
 Yeah 
At that time Daily was revamping they
had a new editor
Yeah 
Rajat Sharma 
Ah
Who is this aap ki adalat 
Yeah now he yeah 
So he
 Aap ki adalat 
He had just taken over uhm and they were
revamping and looking for more people
 Uhm 
Yes 
So I just said take me as a reporter
Uhm 
Chief reporter there was one Mr Rangan
Uhn 
So he interviewed me and he said he found me okay
Yes 
Then he uh took me
Uhm
And I went without a pay hike also I just wanted to get out
Yes 
So one after when the month was getting over I just went
in submitted my resignation in the off day yes from 
Indian Express laughter 
 Yes 
Luckily I got the job yes that is what matter
 Yes 
Yes
So I went there and I started doing beat nearly all
the beats were handled by all the people who were already there
Yes
