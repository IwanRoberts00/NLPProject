<I>
 recording broken 
The journey was by itself not attracting much attention seem
to take longer than usual at last I was at the door step and on
entering the house first thing that I learnt was that my cousins had
not arrived 
Suddenly the journey that I had just completed appeared to be
much more troublesome than what it actually was 
Every part of my body began complaining loud and clear not
being much interested in the delicious food prepared my by by my aunt I
slept hoping that this brother of mine would wake would wake me up in the
morning 
The dawn passed and so did the noon and the sun had 
began begun to set
The phone bell rang having grown tired of waiting and having
cursed him for what would be enough for a life time to bear I was
convinced that the phone carried a message saying we would be arriving on
twenty-sixth 
But no my spirits were once again reaching sky high when I
heard that Raju had rung from the Pu Pune 
railway station itself and in no more than half an hour there we
were all beholding this great man 
He was indeed given a rousing welcome under my leadership 
after having sufficiently aroused the emotion of other family members I
was not much surprised to note that his knowledge about this whole affair 
was not as much compared to mine 
Trying to defend ourselves of this adventure or misadventure 
that was to follow bearing the brunt of all the criticism which was whole
heartedly poured on us we realised that it was just a couple of 
hours before the departure of the Jhelum 
Jhelum did depart sharp at five thirty from Pune as scheduled 
And the two of us sitting facing each other deeply 
engaged in studying the railway time table where we were to go and
how the train sped fast and this was one of my first journey 
in a vestibule train which had an attached pantry car and the sun
 was preparing to make way for the bright star of the night 
We decided to have our dinner courtesy Indian railway 
Hardly a few hours passed we thought of stroll through the
compartment and believe me what a sight it was with the new
considerations to our ages there was enough happenings around that
made us a little uneasy 
For a moment there seem to be a variety of different cinemas 
being screened all around
When the noise of food being served made us rush back to
our seat 
The food was interesting not delicious as such 
My cousin had never ventured to call anything edible bad 
Sleep thrust in with a mixed feelings having decided to
make all the purchases that were to be done at Pune we reached Delhi 
The train was to halt there for three hours 
The experience in travelling in a vestibule train with
an attached pantry car the unknown destination and happiness or hardship
that were to be part of the journey 
Both my cousin and myself are always used to sound sleep 
in the night immaterial of the time place etcetera 
When the dawn broke we were amidst what was known as the heart of
India 
We were travelling through the terrain of Chambal valley 
The numerous hillocks with tricky passages in between we
believed were the most apt for hideout 
Admittedly many had discovered this fact much before us 
The vast expanse of such similar pattern did indeed put up a
scenery quite unforgettable 
Suddenly this gave a an instinct to my
 cousin's mind Why not plan the return journey 
We were to reach Delhi by eight p m and the train was to halt
there for full three hours 
If the journey through central India is so beautiful how would
it be to return along the west coast 
Brilliant idea indeed and the railway time table was once again
searched 
Before all this was completed we reached Jhansi station 
On the adjacent platform there was something really extraordinary
 a beautiful blue and yellow colour train the engine shaped like
an aeroplane 
 O yes it was indeed the two thousand one up 
Shatabdi Express the fastest train in India 
And as though to remind us all about the journey we had a
glimpse of the derailed bogies of the unfortunate Karnataka
Express little further 
All this time the pantry car had kept us happy and satisfied 
As if to prove the station master right when he writes below
the time table in station Trains are liable to gain or lose time
 Jhelum Express screeched into the New Delhi station only three
and half hours late 
Off we were hunting for the reservation counter only to be
enlightened by the vendor that the counter in the station closed by five
thirty p m 
All our hopes were dashed 
We had expected a twenty-four hour booking counter at New Delhi
station 
We were to do a lot of purchases and this was now hampered and
transferred to Jammu Tavi 
We had not opted for the pantry car dinner in anticipation of the
food at New Delhi 
Midnight vendor and some fruitwalas made our
appetite full 
The halt was cut down by an hour and a half 
And by one in the morning we started advancing further north 
The crowd in the train was gradually growing less in number 
with large group detraining at various stops 
The last of our companions got down at Jallandhar leaving
only two of us from the original pack 
The pantry car too was disconnected at Delhi and when we woke
up in the morning My goodness what a sight it was with green
lustrious inviting plains of Punjab 
 Far as far as the eyes could see spread over from one
horizon to the other the vast stretch of land as though somebody had
levelled it totally green thick with vegetation with a lot of
streams running in between 
Oh what a place it was 
As the arrival time at the Jammu Tavi station neared we
were both anticipating to watch the foot hills of Himalaya 
After chhole parathe at Pathankot the train did
come to a halt on a platform which borne the name Jammu Tavi
 
But where were the hills ?
Sense dawned that they were to begin further north 
Trapped by a local commission agent we were about to
reside in a lodge when yet another person showed us a bus standing right
in front of us which was bound to Shrinagar 
It has the name board in Urdu 
Thanking the second one heartedly we were in the bus and the
final leg of the journey had begun 
In sheer contrast to all that we had seen till now this part was
unique the hills for which we had been longing for so long were
right in front of us 
And our bus began its quest towards Shrinagar about two hundred
and forty-eight kilometres drive roughly five hours by our calculation
The bus began to turn right left right and I lost count
at the number of turns 
There was a range of mountains in front of us and slowly the
bus began to scale its height
And just as the last curve took us to the upper most point
of it and there was yet another range of mountains taller than that 
of the previous one 
At the end of it again there was yet another range it was
as if the Himalayas were unfolding themselves layer by layer and you
never knew what was beyond that curve 
There was no let up and we kept on climbing the mountain that
were seeming sky high now began appearing reasonable and as night
approached we reached Baltal 
Just as we were lamenting that we would be deprived of the sight of
remaining journey in darkness the driver announced that the bus was to
halt overnight at Baltal
And begin the quest early next morning 
We were all the more overjoyed and slept in the hotel 
The next morning as the mountains continued to show their great
might and energy with roaring of streams in the valley getting louder
around each curve and streams themselves becoming smaller in size
The bus then was halted in a queue and a curious stroll gave us
the glimpse of the one of the great engineering marvels of our nation
The Jawaharlal Nehru tunnel the longest of its kind and
appropriately it was insc it was inscribed 
 may your life be as long as this tunnel 
Photography was prohibited and the journey through this
twenty-six kilometre long tunnel brought us out in front of another
amazing array of mountains each of them trying to make the other
appear smaller 
The clouds were almost with us now and we did still keep
climbing higher and higher 
It was almost began to seem endless 
I had in my school days seen Ooty but by now we must have
travelled the road to Ooty say about ten times 
Almost every inch of these mountains had tall trees trying
to out do the mountains in reaching the sky 
Following this was again a long stretch of plain road 
impossible we had thought that there being such a long stretch of plain land
after this climb but then it was the Kashmir valley 
Admiring beautiful nature we never realised that our bus by
now was standing in the compound of the tourist reception centre at Shrinagar
Oh god what a journey it had been not a bit of this kind
had ever occurred to us 
No not even in the wildest of our dreams 
From there we proceeded straight to the youth hostel camping
grounds 
Thus if you look into the journey itself a lot of things do
happen that teach us lessons in the philosophy practicability
etcetera only it needs a willful learner
