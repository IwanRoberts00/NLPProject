The journey was  seem
to take longer than usual  and on
entering the house  was that my cousins had
not arrived 
""
Suddenly the journey that I had just completed  appeared to be
much more troublesome 
""
Every part of my body  not
being much interested in the delicious food prepared my by  by my aunt I
slept hoping that this brother of mine would wake  would wake me up in the
morning 
""
The dawn passed 
began  to set
""
The phone bell rang  and having
cursed him for what would be enough for a life time to bear  I was
convinced that the phone carried a message  saying we would be arriving on
twenty-sixth 
""
But no  when I
heard that Raju had rung from the 
railway station itself  we
were all beholding this great man 
""
He was indeed given a rousing welcome 
after having sufficiently aroused the emotion of other family members  I
was not much surprised to note that his knowledge about this whole affair 
was not as much compared to mine 
""
Trying to defend ourselves 
that was to follow bearing the brunt of all the criticism  which was whole
heartedly poured on us 
hours before the departure of the Jhelum 
""
Jhelum did depart sharp at five thirty from Pune as scheduled 
""
And the two of us 
engaged in studying the railway time table  we were to go and
how 
in a vestibule train  and the sun
""
""
We decided to have our dinner 
""
Hardly  we thought of stroll through the
compartment  with the new
considerations to our ages  that
made us a little uneasy 
""
For a moment there seem to be a variety of different cinemas 
being screened  all around
""
When the noise of food  made us rush back to
our seat 
""
The food was interesting 
""
My cousin had never ventured to call anything edible bad 
""
Sleep thrust  having decided to
make all the purchases 
""
The train was to halt there for three hours 
""
The experience  with
an attached pantry car  the unknown destination and happiness or hardship
that were to be part of the journey 
""
Both my cousin and myself 
in the night 
""
When the dawn broke we were amidst what was known as the heart of
India 
""
We were travelling through the terrain of Chambal valley 
""
The numerous hillocks  we
believed were the most apt for hideout 
""
Admittedly 
""
The vast expanse of such similar pattern  did indeed put up a
scenery 
""
Suddenly this gave  instinct to my
""
""
""
We were to reach Delhi by eight p m  and the train was to halt
there for full three hours 
""
If the journey through central India  is so beautiful how would
it be to return along the west coast 
""
Brilliant idea indeed  and the railway time table was once again
searched 
""
Before all this 
""
On the adjacent platform there was something really extraordinary
 the engine shaped like
an aeroplane 
""
""
Shatabdi Express 
""
And as though  to remind us all about the journey we had a
glimpse of the derailed bogies  Karnataka
Express 
""
All this time the pantry car had kept us happy and satisfied 
""
As if to prove the station master right  when he writes below
the time table in station  Trains are liable to gain or lose time
 Jhelum Express screeched into the New Delhi station only three
and half hours late 
""
Off  we were hunting for the reservation counter only to be
enlightened by the vendor  that the counter in the station closed by five
thirty p m 
""
All our hopes were dashed 
""
We had expected a twenty-four hour booking counter at New Delhi
station 
""
We were to do a lot of purchases and this was now hampered and
transferred to Jammu Tavi 
""
We had not opted for the pantry car dinner in anticipation of the
food 
""
Midnight vendor  made our
appetite full 
""
The halt was cut down by an hour and a half 
""
And by one in the morning we started advancing further north 
""
The crowd in the train was gradually growing less in number 
with large group 
""
The last of our companions  leaving
only two of us from the original pack 
""
The pantry car too was disconnected at Delhi  and when we woke
up in the morning  with green
lustrious inviting plains 
""
 spread over from one
horizon to the other  the vast stretch of land as though somebody had
levelled it  thick with vegetation with a lot of
streams running in between 
""
Oh what a place it was 
""
As the arrival time  we
were both anticipating to watch the foot hills of Himalaya 
""
After  at Pathankot the train did
come to a halt on a platform which borne the name  Jammu Tavi
""
""
But where were the hills  ?
""
Sense dawned that they were to begin further north 
""
Trapped by a local commission agent  about to
reside in a lodge  when yet another person showed us a bus standing right
in front of us 
""
It has the name board in Urdu 
""
Thanking the second one heartedly we were in the bus  and the
final leg of the journey had begun 
""
In sheer contrast to all that we had seen till now this part was
unique  were
right in front of us 
""
And our bus began its quest towards Shrinagar  about two hundred
and forty-eight kilometres drive  roughly five hours by our calculation
""
""
The bus began to turn right  I lost count
at the number of turns 
""
There was a range of mountains in front of us  and slowly the
bus began to scale its height
""
And  upper most point
of it and there was yet another range of mountains 
of the previous one 
""
At the end of it  it was
as if the Himalayas were unfolding themselves  and you
never knew 
""
There was  no let up and we kept on climbing the mountain that
were seeming sky high now  and as night
approached we reached Baltal 
""
Just as we were lamenting that we would be deprived of the sight of
remaining journey in darkness  the driver announced that the bus was to
halt overnight at Baltal
""
And begin the quest early next morning 
""
We were all the more overjoyed and slept in the hotel 
""
The next morning as the mountains continued to show their great
might and energy  getting louder
around each curve  becoming smaller in size
""
""
The bus then was halted in a queue  and a curious stroll gave us
the glimpse  of the one of the great engineering marvels of our nation
""
""
The Jawaharlal Nehru tunnel  the longest of its kind and
appropriately 
""
""
Photography was prohibited  and the journey through this
twenty-six kilometre long tunnel brought us out in front of  another
amazing array of mountains  trying to make the other
appear smaller 
""
The clouds were almost with us now  keep
climbing higher and higher 
""
It was almost began to seem endless 
""
I had in my school days  but by now we must have
travelled the road to Ooty 
""
Almost every inch of these mountains  trying
to out do the mountains in reaching the sky 
""
Following this was again a long stretch of plain road 
impossible we had thought that there being such a long stretch of plain land
after this 
""
Admiring beautiful nature we never realised  that our bus by
now was standing in the compound of the tourist reception centre at Shrinagar
""
""
Oh god  not a bit of this kind
had ever occurred to us 
""
No not even in the wildest of our dreams 
""
From there we proceeded  straight to the youth hostel camping
grounds 
""
Thus  a lot of things do
happen  practicability
etcetera
