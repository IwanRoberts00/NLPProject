Indian food is often spoken of as rich which is to say fatty
""
""
Nothing should be farther from the truth 
""
It is unfortunate that the excessive use of  desi ghee
""
by a handful of half baked cook 
""
Our food is rich 
""
It is true that we sometimes cook in a little more fat than
necessary 
""
But the amazing thing about Indian cuisine is that the cooking is
deemed complete 
""
In other words  when fully
cooked 
""
The excess fat merely uses the cooking process 
""
In any event  it is supposed to be drained off before the dish is
served 
""
In fact the drained fat 
 can be reused and makes a better fat medium because the flavour and aroma
of spices 
""
Of course  cannot be used again and
again  is
even for one solitary moment  recommending that to use a gram or a
mililitre of extra fat 
""
The same applies for that nasty word 
""
""
The fact is 
""
We make use of our exotic spices for their special flavour and
aroma 
""
The use of red chilli  one's
 don't want to
""
""
There are however  are using more red
chillies than the others 
""
They are the exceptions rather than the rule 
""
Having said that  this episode is guarantee to give lovers of
hot food 
""
Those with feeble guts  today's
""
""
Hey Manjit  this pungent nose testing aroma ?
""
What you are smelling is 
""
And  sixty-four
red chillies 
""
He is going to make us the spice chop called  lal maas
""
""
One of the kinds you and I know about 
""
The red here refers to this 
""
And he is going to use sixty of them 
""
Of course  the hottest dish in the land
""
""
As you can see  this guy is just about ready to burn my in all
""
""
You if you have  steel- line stomach this is just a delicacy
for you 
""
Whatever my fears about red chillies  got a health
mandate and get into my dig 
""
""
Welcome to this Dawat 
menu is 
""
Pieces of succulant lamb in a volcanic gravy 
""
A dish guaranteed to wake up your insights 
""
""
""
Two and a quarter pounds or one kilo of lamb  deboned and cut it
into one and a half inch cubes 
""
Sixty red chillies 
""
One and a quarter cups 
""
One third cup 
""
One cup 
""
One teaspoon 
""
Four teaspoons 
""
Half a teaspoon turmeric powder 
""
Five tablespoons refined oil 
""
The preparation time for this dish is one hour  and the cooking
time is fifty minutes 
""
With accompaniments  this dish serves approximately four people
""
""
The method 
""
Remove stems from the red chillies  beseed and
soak sixty whole red chillies in a bowl of water 
""
Before you get alarmed at the quantity of red chillies used 
here is a reassuring word about red chillies 
""
""
While Manjeet prepares the other ingredients  let me clear
some cobwebs about red chillies 
""
For a long time  the word
spicy has been synonymous with chillies 
""
To us Indians  the word spicy means a combination of exotic
spices 
""
Eaten in the right quantity  and the prescribed limit is one
teaspoon 
""
Chillies are said to prevent cold  cold sweats induced by
tension 
""
Now in the last thing  to consume a little
bit of chilli during the monsoon 
""
""
Proceeding with the preparation  whisk one cup of yoghurt
in a bowl 
""
Add the red chillies  shake a dry girdle and add one
teaspoonful of cumin seeds 
""
Roast lightly  until the cumin pops
and emits a unique aroma 
""
Now add this to the yoghurt chilli mixture  noise of
stirring 
""
Add four teaspoons of corriander powder  half teaspoon turmeric
powder 
""
Whisk 
""
Some of the effects of the red chillies are also neutralised by the
garlic and yoghurt in this recipe 
""
Without yoghurt it would probably be impossible to digest all those
red hot chillies 
""
And now for the cooking 
""
Heat five tablespoons of refined oil  add the sliced garlic and
set over a medium heat until golden 
""
Add the onions and stir again until golden brown  nise of
stirring 
""
Finally  add the meat and stir fry until the fat begins to leave
the sides of the pan 
""
This process is also called pruno  and takes approximately five
to six minutes 
""
Now add the chilli yoghurt mixture  and stir fry until the
moisture evaporates 
""
To complete the cooking  add three and one third cups of water
""
""
Bring to a boil  stir occasionally until
the meat is cooked 
""
To check if the meat is done  and break it
apart 
""
The gravy should boil till it has the consistency of a thick sauce
""
""
Check the salt 
""
But this is best eaten with the steamed rice or  chapati
""
""
Arrange chopped tomatoes and onions in a platter  and spoon on
the sizzling 
""
The second dish on our menu today is Pepper Chicken or  mori
curry 
""
Chicken with a totally unique flavour  salty chicken taste buds
""
""
""
Pepper chicken is from the Chickena district in Tamil Nad 
which is home to the trading community of Chickenna 
""
They however call it 
""
In it they use an inordinately large quantity of coarsely ground
black pepper powder 
""
I can see Manjeet is getting a bit little impatient 
""
And 
later in this programme 
""
""
If you are ready with your stationery here is a list of
ingredients 
""
Twelve chicken thighs  five cloves
 a quarter teaspoon fenugreek
seeds  two teaspoons

corns 
""

stirring 
""
Rub the chicken thighs individually in the marinade  and set
aside for thirty minutes 
""
And now 
""
Heat six tablespoons of refined oil in a pan  add the marinated
chicken pieces 
""
Set a evenly to feel in flavour and juices

Cook this mixture for two to four minutes 
""
Now add the chicken and salt to taste 
""
Add water 
""
Reduce the heat  and simmer until the chicken is
tender 
""
This will take approximately ten to twelve minutes 
""
While we wait for the chicken to cook  a brief word about black
pepper
""
""
Talking about  it is inevitable that I
should tell you about pepper 
""
Foremost 
""
Taken with honey 
""
It is good for the heart 
and cure piles 
""
Sprinkled on fruits  sea or
rock it is supposed to make for an excellent digestive 
""
""
To serve make a bed of the gravy 
""
Arrange pieces of chicken  and garnish with fresh corriander
""
""
In fact celebrity panel does not feel rich tonight with the
 black will definitely be the other colour
scheme 
""
Let us proceed to the dining table  while our guest try out
this 
""
""
You know what we are eating is 
chikenna 
""
I thought they ate really spicy food 
""
""
Uh it is spicy but it is slightly  means a
little oil to go head off
""
You know he makes the second dish for that 
""
""
Fifteen chicken pieces for this chicken and what pieces are
these ?
""
""
Yeah this chicken we have used the uh  thigh of the
chicken 
""
So that you have the consistency 
""
I thought it is the same and  every person gets
the same part that is important
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Actually we have gone a step beyond uh uhm and what we are
talking about now 
""
Uh  everybody
is  the the shape of the vegetable is identical so
that  plate you don't have
this terrible sense of envy as if you know  say Arti has the better
piece and Romi hasn't got the one that she like 
""
So we just make sure that everyboby is dining pleasurely equal by
providing an identical cut  all are being identical size of vegetables
""
""
""
But this what about  may be a particular
guest would prefer to have another piece
""
""
Romi  not as if we sort of you know done this at
random
""
But we have consulted our butchers any how our butchery  uh
 in Indian cooking is a very very strong point without that you really
can't  uh provide any good uh delicacies
""
So we consulted our butcher and  as per his advice decided for
example the case of the  chickenna but the ideal
stuff would be 
""
May be Manjeet can tell us a little bit more about it
""
""
Yes its your own choice also  whether it may be
that must need one  from the
thigh or the 
""
""
I see that means originally  from the chickenna if they
have a specific piece or this you feel is inferior in now
""
""
Well this uh  of the
meat should to be used in a particular curry 
""
Originally 
that's  to as a matter of fact if I may say I am looking a bit
""
You know in the South  as
a major Brahminical influence
""
""
And consequently you will uh  notice that when you go down
south that 
sizes 
""
And they are really nugget size pieces 
""
""
But they originally do it for snacks you they will know only
use of this size
""
""
Normally it can be looked this size
