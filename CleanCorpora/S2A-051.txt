Indian food is often spoken of as rich which is to say fatty
 and spicy meaning chilli hot 
Nothing should be farther from the truth 
It is unfortunate that the excessive use of desi ghee
 which is clarified butter or vegetable shortening and spices 
by a handful of half baked cook made as a misunderstood food 
Our food is rich but not fatty 
It is true that we sometimes cook in a little more fat than
necessary 
But the amazing thing about Indian cuisine is that the cooking is
deemed complete when the fat leaves the sides or comes on the surface 
In other words the ingredients expose all fat when fully
cooked 
The excess fat merely uses the cooking process 
In any event it is supposed to be drained off before the dish is
served 
In fact the drained fat which we call rogan 
 can be reused and makes a better fat medium because the flavour and aroma
of spices acquired during the cooking of the dish 
Of course the rogan cannot be used again and
again but just once again which is not to say that this series is
even for one solitary moment recommending that to use a gram or a
mililitre of extra fat 
The same applies for that nasty word spicy 
The fact is our food is spicy not chilli hot 
We make use of our exotic spices for their special flavour and
aroma 
The use of red chilli on the other hand is at one's
 own discreation like to burn yourself do so don't want to
 don't burn others as well 
There are however some regions which are using more red
chillies than the others 
They are the exceptions rather than the rule 
Having said that this episode is guarantee to give lovers of
hot food a vicarious thrill 
Those with feeble guts I advice to stay away from today's
 fiery delight cough 
Hey Manjit what's this pungent nose testing aroma ?
What you are smelling is red chillies 
And believe it or not we are going to use sixty-four
red chillies with two and a quarter pound of meat 
He is going to make us the spice chop called lal maas
 translated that means red meat 
One of the kinds you and I know about 
The red here refers to this red chillies 
And he is going to use sixty of them mind boggling figure 
Of course this is arguably the hottest dish in the land
As you can see this guy is just about ready to burn my in all
You if you have steel- line stomach this is just a delicacy
for you 
Whatever my fears about red chillies I've got a health
mandate and get into my dig 
Welcome to this Dawat the first dish in today's 
menu is lal maas or red meat 
Pieces of succulant lamb in a volcanic gravy 
A dish guaranteed to wake up your insights 
 We'll begin with a list of ingredients 
Two and a quarter pounds or one kilo of lamb deboned and cut it
into one and a half inch cubes 
Sixty red chillies 
One and a quarter cups finely sliced onions 
One third cup peeled and sliced garlic 
One cup yoghurt 
One teaspoon roasted cumin 
Four teaspoons corriander powder 
Half a teaspoon turmeric powder 
Five tablespoons refined oil 
The preparation time for this dish is one hour and the cooking
time is fifty minutes 
With accompaniments this dish serves approximately four people
The method 
Remove stems from the red chillies slit them beseed and
soak sixty whole red chillies in a bowl of water for fifteen minutes 
Before you get alarmed at the quantity of red chillies used 
here is a reassuring word about red chillies 
While Manjeet prepares the other ingredients let me clear
some cobwebs about red chillies 
For a long time especially outside this country the word
spicy has been synonymous with chillies 
To us Indians the word spicy means a combination of exotic
spices of which chilli is just one measly part 
Eaten in the right quantity and the prescribed limit is one
teaspoon or two or three whole red chillies per person per day 
Chillies are said to prevent cold cold sweats induced by
tension and cholera 
Now in the last thing it is important to consume a little
bit of chilli during the monsoon 
Proceeding with the preparation whisk one cup of yoghurt
in a bowl 
Add the red chillies shake a dry girdle and add one
teaspoonful of cumin seeds 
Roast lightly noise of roasting until the cumin pops
and emits a unique aroma 
Now add this to the yoghurt chilli mixture noise of
stirring 
Add four teaspoons of corriander powder half teaspoon turmeric
powder and stir in salt to taste 
Whisk and set 
Some of the effects of the red chillies are also neutralised by the
garlic and yoghurt in this recipe 
Without yoghurt it would probably be impossible to digest all those
red hot chillies 
And now for the cooking 
Heat five tablespoons of refined oil add the sliced garlic and
set over a medium heat until golden noise of stirring 
Add the onions and stir again until golden brown nise of
stirring 
Finally add the meat and stir fry until the fat begins to leave
the sides of the pan 
This process is also called pruno and takes approximately five
to six minutes 
Now add the chilli yoghurt mixture and stir fry until the
moisture evaporates noise of stirring 
To complete the cooking add three and one third cups of water
Bring to a boil cover and simmer stir occasionally until
the meat is cooked 
To check if the meat is done take out a piece and break it
apart 
The gravy should boil till it has the consistency of a thick sauce
Check the salt and the fiery red meat is done 
But this is best eaten with the steamed rice or chapati
 
Arrange chopped tomatoes and onions in a platter and spoon on
the sizzling lal maas 
The second dish on our menu today is Pepper Chicken or mori
curry 
Chicken with a totally unique flavour salty chicken taste buds
Pepper chicken is from the Chickena district in Tamil Nad 
which is home to the trading community of Chickenna 
They however call it murgakoli chickenna 
In it they use an inordinately large quantity of coarsely ground
black pepper powder 
I can see Manjeet is getting a bit little impatient 
And I'll tell you a little bit more about the pepper 
later in this programme 
If you are ready with your stationery here is a list of
ingredients 
Twelve chicken thighs seven corns cardamoms five cloves
 two sticks of cinnamon one inch each a quarter teaspoon fenugreek
seeds one and half cups of finely chopped onions two teaspoons

Rub the chicken thighs individually in the marinade and set
aside for thirty minutes 
And now on to the cooking 
Heat six tablespoons of refined oil in a pan add the marinated
chicken pieces one at a time 
Set a evenly to feel in flavour and juices 
Reduce to low heat and remove 
Add more oil if required and in the same pan add five green
cardamoms five cloves few sticks of cinnamon and a quarter

Reduce the heat cover and simmer until the chicken is
tender 
This will take approximately ten to twelve minutes 
While we wait for the chicken to cook a brief word about black
pepper
Talking about chetinad it is inevitable that I
should tell you about pepper 
Foremost pepper is said to cure and prevent asthma 
Taken with honey it is said to give relief in heavy cold 
It is good for the heart and is said to ease stomach aches 
and cure piles 
Sprinkled on fruits or other foods along with salt sea or
rock it is supposed to make for an excellent digestive 
To serve make a bed of the gravy 
Arrange pieces of chicken and garnish with fresh corriander
 and more fresh ground pepper 
In fact celebrity panel does not feel rich tonight with the
 lal maas black will definitely be the other colour
scheme Interuption 
Let us proceed to the dining table while our guest try out
this coveted dishes 
You know what we are eating is murgakoli 
chikenna when translated what that means is Pepper Chicken 
I thought they ate really spicy food 
Uh it is spicy but it is slightly fried means a
little oil to go head off
You know he makes the second dish for that laughs 
Fifteen chicken pieces for this chicken and what pieces are
these ?
Yeah this chicken we have used the uh thigh of the
chicken 
So that you have the consistency uh is there in the base 
I thought it is the same and that every every person gets
the same part that is important
Uhm
Actually we have gone a step beyond uh uhm and what we are
talking about now is dinapsychology 
Uh and the objective here is to make sure that everybody
is cut off meat or the the shape of the vegetable is identical so
that when you peep into somebody else's plate you don't have
this terrible sense of envy as if you know uh say Arti has the better
piece and Romi hasn't got the one that she like 
So we just make sure that everyboby is dining pleasurely equal by
providing an identical cut all are being identical size of vegetables
But this what about one word may be a particular
guest would prefer to have another piece
Romi it's not as if we sort of you know done this at
random
But we have consulted our butchers any how our butchery uh
 in Indian cooking is a very very strong point without that you really
can't uh provide any good uh delicacies
So we consulted our butcher and as per his advice decided for
example the case of the murgakoli chickenna but the ideal
stuff would be the thigh 
May be Manjeet can tell us a little bit more about it
Yes its your own choice also and uh whether it may be
that must need one dine whether you use dine from the
thigh or the one word 
I see that means originally from the chickenna if they
have a specific piece or this you feel is inferior in now
Well this uh they feel that one one word of the
meat should to be used in a particular curry 
Originally I've got some chicken of it used 
that's to as a matter of fact if I may say I am looking a bit
You know in the South in considering the one word as
a major Brahminical influence
And consequently you will uh notice that when you go down
south that uh the pieces of meat are usually cut into very small 
sizes 
And they are really nugget size pieces 
But they originally do it for snacks you they will know only
use of this size
Normally it can be looked this size
