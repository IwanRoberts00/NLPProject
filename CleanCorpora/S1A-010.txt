 Laughter 
Really 
Just imagine we have to wait here for half an hour 
And just doing this 
They must be wondering what we are doing no ?
Yes laughs 
And nobody is going to find us here 
because we are locked here laughs 
Locked from outside laughs 
Feeling nice 
But next week by this time
Uhm
Finished most of the papers
Which ?
How many days ?
Two days more
Uhn today is the final day so naturally we have uh
 nine more days to go say 
Nine 
Isn't it ?
Nine ten
Uh ten
Because Sun Sunday is also counted you know 
And whatever it is I am waiting for the thirtieth 
Ah 
Because I was actually waiting for these classes and not for
the exams because I know what I am going to do there because I am not
at all prepared 
Even I am not prepared actually we hardly get any time
to study no when we work
Uhm 
You know it's very difficult for us
You being in college it was something different and for
school we have to be there right from ten to four ten 
And then our headmistress is very particular about our
correction and all that 
To add with it our system is very exam oriented 
Every second day we have some examination and some correction 
Even we have exams 
In that way actually every four months or three months we have 
because we have pre- test and test and annual and half yearly and all
this things naturally it uh just has to be done 
And our college is more like a school you know 
That uh 
This principal she is very particular about it 
All that discipline has to be maintained you know 
But in Orissa you know Lecturers have a very nice time there
 uhm like there is nobody to actually check on them 
They may or may not take classes 
And children bank on the tuitions rather than on the
lectures 
So if you are very wealthy you do very well 
 That's how it goes 
See over here we are bothered about linguistics and grammar
and all we don't know what's happening in India no the whole 
 this way it's in such a turmoil stage and we are not
We are more or less
 Not bothered about 
We are more or less more we are more or less in a
linguistic island you say 
 Lingui laughter 
Cut off from the world 
 Cut off from the world
And daily now we le read linguistic talk
linguistic walk linguistic
And we have to be conscious of our actions and all these
things no all the time can't we live free 
Actually when we return we'll have to get into our old
habit for sometime and then comeback to linguistics again laughs
 That's all 
Nothing to 
But I don't know what I am going to do for the exams no ?
 It's such a I have never been so unprepared for
the exams as I am now 
Because uh I just couldn't study and now all the things are
coming in at once
Yeah 
You can get you are getting to understand the whole thing
at once you know 
So naturally it's very difficult for us to take uh
 things inside and capture it and then produce it 
 And repeat in the examination paper
Actually it's very tough 
 But then 
 But 
It is one way it's good that atleast we are
getting to know something atleast better than because all of us can't
take leave all of can't be accomodated in Hyderabad in C I F L 
So it's one way we are getting a touch of it not
the whole thing but a touch of it 
Whatever it is you know I am not the results 
I was interested to get some of my concept clear 
And I feel I was able to clear some of it I was bothered about my
pronunciation I was bothered about some of my grammatical mistakes and
all that and there was nobody there whom I could approached to you see
So I thought this course would be a great help to me I am not
bothered about the result part of it 
 Even I 
Actually because we teach in a our circumstances and
surroundings are so no that we get we are separated from the English
speaking people as it is because in my place no one speaks English only I
speak 
And whom I to speak in that way 
 That's why we are confined in our area especially I
living in this rural area these people they don't even know English
nothing so it becomes very difficult for me 
And I was getting to forget my pronunciations also
Now you see you see Dr Jairaman you want in my group today
no 
Dr Jairaman check me so many time 
But I I don't know how it come to because I I in
pronunciations I was never checked 
That was one thing spelling and pronunciation I was always right
you know 
But just because I am not habituated with I am not 
getting 
 Practice 
One thing right from school days I should say uhm some of
the pronunciation that we were taught was wrong 
And whatever I had picked up it is from the media whatever it
is because I had interest in it I tried to rectify myself 
But whatever we were taught during our school days was something
 completely different 
And almost I should say it was something wrong that was taught to
us
So I feel these things should be taught to the primary teachers 
they should go through these 
All the English medium school the so called English
medium schools 
The teacher should go through this sort of training where
they can rectify the pronunciation before they give it to little one
 Definitely 
 It should be 
Yeah
Because it is there where the base is formed 
And once things get destructed there means whole life is
 They can't change
You can't change 
If you rec it's mean very it's 
uh difficult to rectify the wrong and then come in to correction you
know we learnt in our method haan this thing
 Haan 
But actually I was taught in a very I told you last
night no that I had a very surrounding and very good uh people 
who taught me
So it came in to me as my first language 
I even forgot my mother tongue when I first went into 
there learning not learning it was a language acquisition rather than
language learning for me 
Because I was placed in that position so I am very lucky in that
way you know which I got now how but
 Now how 
 But 
Just because I am placed my setting now the
atmosphere I live in is totally Bengali 
So naturally I am getting to forget it I I
said I'll another few days if I stay over there I'll 
also forget the name of Sha the spelling of Shakespeare 
 Yeah 
Actually you have to give
 Haan that's very natural 
sneeze 
One thing in our place that is in that is in Bhubaneshwar 
first and foremost if you speak English means they will alienate you
 Haan 
They will say that means we are of 
Showing off and all these things they'll say
 Relationship there becomes very formal you have
to speak in Oriya in order to be like them otherwise they will just throw
you out of their group
No but here they think that they'll you are
showing off
 Haan 
If you speak English you are showing off
 Haan 
That is another part of it 
And one more thing another thing how I rectified myself
because all almost all all of us all my brother and sisters we
have read in English medium school 
And naturally we used to fight and quarrel a lot a lot
Yeah
And we used to do that in English 
 So that is how we use to rectify each other and 
somehow we could that is how I could I can speak little bit of
correct yes English 
 Yes it was 
 Yes 
But you are actually the means thing that they
should 
Uh I think uh they should e extend the say
you know of this course 
It should be one and half months or two months you no
Uhm
Or they can organised the contact programme and then take
the examination that are later date because we have to we
can't just read the books 
And we can't form the ideas see you see the ways 
Dr this Mr V he was totally changed actually because he was uh the
concepts are clear not clear to us 
 Of course 
We have got the book language the language of the book
and we just learn it like that and we put it out 
But we have to clear the concept we have to get the actual
technical lang languages the term we have to get 
Like I answered the right thing today I had that concept but I
didn't know the actual technicality I have to express it 
because in the book they are just given no one explained it to us no
 that's why
 Yeah how to express it 
For that we need one more month
One more month yes
This is too short actually
 That's what I'm suggesting 
They should have the programme
Programme
Programme and then afterwards 
 And then 
The exams afterwards
They should they should
They should do that
It should have that way
Yeah the organisation
And now uh uhm what is that heads are so crammed
Crammed isn't it any way
It is difficult and I think in lingistic paper I am going to
write my literature in my literature paper I'll do my politics 
laughter 
I don't know what I am going to do 
Oh yours your head is not reeling any more no ?
No in the morning I had a tough time I thought I was
going to fall down
Even I thought I was fal you wouldn't feel to go
also I was getting quite scared you know 
But I was definite it was because of the food yesterday
Not
Should have
I think it was my pressure 
Pressure went up 
May be the pressure has gone up high again 
And I was scared
 But you 
You got medicine for it 
No I didn't bring my medicine
Why ?
Because I am very bad at taking medicine 
No but should you know these are life saving drugs you
know you should keep them
So that is the that was the problem and today if I
wouldn't have taken little rest I don't know what I would have done
throughout the day 
Yeah you should have
No but uh I think you must be because your stomach
was upset that's why the pressure up it must be
Upset no
Upset in the sense that you didn't take food it was empty all
the gas formation and all that it can
I know suddenly this reeling sensation 
It was something from that as soon as I got up from the
bed I needed support 
I thought I was going to fall down somewhere 
So I hurriedly had everything I had my bath and everything and
finally I came down to thejust 
You can feast for the night today no
 Haan laughter 
I missed it I really missed it awful 
I didn't know actually and I this lady this Rekha she
came and told me then she had sent it
I should say we have got uh
 So I 
She said she had sent it so I said she had sent I thought
they had arranged the boys and all and I haven't given my name 
So I said I won't take it I said take it back please I won't
take it 
She should have told me Miss Ranjana sent it then I could
have because it was also not good to sent the refuse the thing back
no
It was but I told her I explained that I didn't know it
actually 
And now what class do we have ?
 It's another class of grammar and linguistics again
