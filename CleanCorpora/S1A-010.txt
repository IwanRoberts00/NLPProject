<I>
""
""
""
""
Really 
""
Just imagine 
""
""
And just doing this 
""
""
They must be wondering what we are doing no ?
""
""
Yes 
""
And nobody is going to find us here 
""
because we are locked here 
""
""
Locked from outside 
""
Feeling nice 
""
""
But next week by this time
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Finished  most of the papers
""
""
Which  ?
""
""
How many days  ?
""
""
Two days more
""
""
Uhn today is the final day  we have uh
""
""
""
Nine 
""
""
Isn't it ?
""
""
Nine ten
""
""
Uh ten
""
""
Because 
""
""
And whatever it is I am waiting for the thirtieth 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Because I was actually waiting for these classes and not for
the exams  because I am not
at all prepared 
""
""
Even I am not prepared  hardly get any time
to study no when we work
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
You know  very difficult for us
""
""
You being in college it was something different  and for
school we have to be there right from ten 
""
And then our headmistress is very  particular about our
correction and all that 
""
To add with it 
""
Every second day we have some examination and some correction 
""
""
Even we have exams 
""
In that way actually every four months or three months we have 
because we have pre- test and test  and annual and half yearly and all
this things naturally 
""
And our college is more like a school you know 
""
""
That uh 
""
""
This principal she is very particular about it 
""
All that discipline has to be maintained you know 
""
""
But in Orissa you know Lecturers have a very nice time there
""
""
They may or may not take classes 
""
And  rather than on the
lectures 
""
So if you are very wealthy you do very well 
""
""
""
""
See over here we are bothered about linguistics and grammar
and all we don't know 
 such a turmoil stage and we are not
""
""
""
We are more or less
""
""
""
""
""
We are more or less  we are more or less in a
linguistic island you say 
""
""
""
""
""
Cut off from the 
""
""
 off from the world
""
""
And daily now we  talk
linguistic  walk linguistic
""
""
And we have to be conscious of our actions and all these
things no all the time 
""
Actually when we return  get into our old
habit for sometime and then comeback to linguistics again  laughs
""
""
""
""
""
""
Nothing to 
""
""
But I don't know what I am going to do for the exams no  ?
""
 for
the exams 
""
Because uh  all the things are
coming in  at once
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You can get  you are getting to understand the whole thing
at once you know 
""
So naturally  take uh
""
""
""
 in the examination paper
""
Actually 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is  good that atleast we are
getting to know something atleast better than  because all of us can't
take leave 
""
So  not
the whole thing but a touch of it 
""
""
Whatever it is you know I am not the results 
""
I was interested to get some of my 
""
And I feel I was able to clear some of it I was bothered about my
pronunciation I was bothered about some of my grammatical  mistakes and
all that  and there was nobody there whom I could approached to you see
""
So I thought this course would be a great help to me  I am not
bothered about the result part of it 
""
""
""
""
""
Actually because we teach in a  our circumstances and
surroundings are so no that we get  we are separated from the English
speaking people as it is because in my place no one speaks English  only I
speak 
""
And whom I 
""
 especially I
living in  they don't even know English
nothing so 
""
And I was getting to forget my pronunciations also
""
Now  you want in my group today
no 
""
Dr Jairaman check me so many time 
""
But I I don't know how it come to  in
pronunciations I was never checked 
""
That was one thing spelling and pronunciation I was always right
you know 
""
But 
getting 
""
""
""
""
""
One thing right from school days I should say  uhm some of
the pronunciation that we were taught was wrong 
""
And whatever I had picked up it is from the  media whatever it
is 
""
But whatever we were taught during our school days was something
""
""
And almost I should say it was something wrong that was taught to
us
""
So I feel these things should be taught to the primary teachers 
they 
""
All the English medium  so called English
medium schools 
""
The teacher should go through this sort of  where
they can rectify the pronunciation before they give it to little one
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Because it is there where the base is formed 
""
And once things get destructed there means whole life  is
""
""
""
 can't change
""
""
You can't change 
""
""
If you 
uh  difficult to rectify the wrong and then come in to correction you
know we learnt in our method  this thing
""
""
""
""
""
""
But actually I was taught in a  I told you last
night no that I had a very surrounding 
who taught me
""
So it came in to me as my first language 
""
I even forgot my mother tongue 
there learning  not learning it was a language acquisition rather than
language learning for me 
""
Because I was placed in that position so I am very lucky in that
way you know which I got  but
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Just because I am placed  the
atmosphere I live in is totally Bengali 
""
So naturally  I
said 
also forget the name of 
""
""
""
""
""
Actually you have to give
""
""
""
sneeze 
""
One thing in our place that is in 
first and foremost if you speak English means they will alienate you
""
""
""
""
""
They will say that 
""
""
Showing off and all these things  say
""
""
""
 there becomes very formal you have
to speak in Oriya in order to be like them  otherwise they will just throw
you out of their group
""
""
No but here they think that  you are
showing off
""
""
""
""
""
If you speak  you are showing off
""
""
""
""
""
That is another part of it 
""
And  one more thing another thing how I rectified myself
because all  all my brother and sisters we
have read in English medium school 
""
And naturally we used to fight and quarrel a lot  a lot
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And we used to do that in English 
""
""
somehow we could  I can speak little bit of
correct 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But you are actually  thing that they
should 
""
""
Uh I think uh  say
you know of this 
""
It should be one and half months or two months you no
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Or they can organised the  contact programme and then take
the examination  we
can't just read the books 
""
And we can't 
Dr this Mr V he was totally changed actually because he was uh  the
concepts are clear not clear to us 
""
""
""
""
""
We have got the book language  the language of the book
and we just learn it like that and we 
""
But we have to clear the concept  we have to get the actual
technical 
""
Like I answered the right thing today  I had that concept but I
didn't know 
because  no one explained it to us no
 why
""
""
""
""
""
For that we need one more month
""
""
One more month yes
""
""
This  actually
""
""
""
""
""
They should have the programme
""
""
Programme
""
""
Programme and then 
""
""
""
""
""
The exams afterwards
""
""
They should they should
""
""
They should do that
""
""
It should have that way
""
""
Yeah  the organisation
""
""
And now  uh uhm what is that heads are so crammed
""
""
Crammed isn't it any way
""
""
It is difficult and I think in lingistic paper I am going to
write my literature in my literature paper 
laughter 
""
""
I don't know what I am going to do 
""
""
Oh yours  ?
""
""
No  I thought I was
going to fall down
""
""
Even I thought I was  you wouldn't feel to go
also I was getting quite scared you know 
""
But I was  yesterday
""
""
""
Not
""
""
Should have
""
""
I think it was my pressure 
""
""
Pressure went up 
""
""
May be 
""
And I  scared
""
""
""
""
""
You got medicine for it 
""
""
No I didn't bring my medicine
""
""
Why ?
""
""
Because I am very bad at taking medicine 
""
""
No but should you know these are  life saving drugs you
know you should keep them
""
""
So that is the  if I
wouldn't have taken little rest I don't know what I would have done
throughout the day 
""
""
Yeah  you should have
""
""
No but uh  must be because your stomach
was upset  it must be
""
""
Upset no
""
""
Upset in the sense that you didn't take food it was empty all
the gas formation and all that  it can
""
""
I know suddenly this reeling sensation 
""
It was something  as soon as I got up from the
bed I needed support 
""
I thought I was going to fall down somewhere 
""
So I hurriedly had everything  I had my bath and everything and
finally I came down to thejust 
""
""
You can feast for the night today no
""
""
""
""
""
I missed it 
""
""
I didn't know actually  this lady this Rekha she
came and told me  then she had sent it
""
""
I should say  have got uh
""
""
""
""
""
She said she had sent it  so I said she had sent I thought
they had arranged the boys and all and I haven't given my name 
""
So I said I won't take it  I said take it back please I won't
take it 
""
She should have told me Miss  then I could
have  refuse the thing back
no
""
It was  I explained that I didn't know it
actually 
""
And now what class do we have  ?
""
""
 another class of grammar and linguistics again
