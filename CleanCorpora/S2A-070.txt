He has also canvassed at uh this stage that the defence may 
object the prosecution that exhibit five has no endorsement of Dr Ram
 P W number four to show that whether the deceased was in a
position to make dying declaration or not 
He has thus raised the query as to why the S E M was not uh

Krisnaram Ram 
What is the uhm necessity of obtaining endorsement of Dr uh uh 
 Ram ?

two the mother of the deceased who uh also states that the patient was in
a position to speak 
There is no suggestion made by the defence to P W number one and

Uh he has then canvassed before this court that this court shall
also consider the conduct of the accused 
That the accused has reported the incident to P W number two 
the mother of the deceased after going to her house and then telling that
he would bring some money for medicine and went away and he did not return
The learned special P P has then canvassed before this court as to
why the accused ran away on the pretext of uh bringing uh money from uh
for medicine 
 E E if according to him
the accused had not commi uh committed 
the offence of throwing the uh lighted match-stick on the person of the
deceased
He would not have uh he would not certainly run away 
Uh he has also canvassed before this court that the deceased had

regarding the panchanama exhibit A that is the scene of
offence uh of panchnama which is the nature of corroborative
evidence on as the article uh saree blouse bottle 
match-box etcetera that is in all six articles were uh recovered and
had shown in in exhibit eighteen that there was kerosene on these
articles 
Lastly the learned special P P has canvassed before this court 
that all the threee dying declarations are consistent and uhm there is no
different version in this respect 
Uh according to him each one of the dying declaration is sufficient
to prove the guilt of the accused uh independently 
He has also canvassed before this court that about the conduct of
the accused that uh by not remaining present in the hospital uh 
hospital show Shows that it is the accused
only who is uh responsible for this offence
He has also canvassed before this court that the neighbours of
the deceased removed the deceased to K E M hospital and not the accused as it
should uh should have been 
The learned special P P therefore has strong uh seriously
urged that he has proved the charge beyond a reasonable doubt against
the accused and that the accused may be dealt uh with accordingly 
Miss Dwivedi Trivedi the learned special P P clears
troat uh appearing for the def uh defence 
 has canvassed before this court that there is no direct eye
witness to the incident
She has canvassed before this court that the accused was charged
for the offence under section three nought seven I P C at the outset 
And that the charge uh appears to have been uh altered to
section three nought two uh I P C 
She has also canvassed before this court that this is a case of
circumstantial evidence 
She has also canvassed before this court that on the first
dying declaration recorded by P W number one there is no endorsement of
the doctor to the effect that the deceased was in a position to speak and
to make the dying declaration 
She has also canvassed before this court that the doctors
endorsement is necessary to show that patient was in a position to speak
The second uh point which the learned defence council has canvassed
before this court is about uh procuring of kerosene bottle which
according to her is silent 
Uh the panchnama showed that the plastic was
containing kerosene
The learned defence council relied on the evidence of P W
number two and has stated that the deceased poured kerosene uh from the
kerosene lamp article four
The learned defence council further canvassed before this court 
that regarding the seizure of articles the blouse article number
three ought to have been burnt if the deceased had burn injuries from
chest to abdomen 
However according to the learned defence council looking to the
evidence of P W number one to five she has canvassed that the blouse
article three is not burnt but it is torn 
She has also invited the attention of this cou 
 uh court to the two sarees in this
case and raised the query as to how two sarees are taken
charge of 
The deceased cannot be expected to wear two sarees
 uh at one and the same time
Therefore according to her it creates doubt about this case in
view of the uh production of two sarees by the
prosecution
