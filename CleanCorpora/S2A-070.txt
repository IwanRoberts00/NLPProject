""
He has also canvassed at uh this stage that the defence may 
object the prosecution that exhibit five has no endorsement of Dr  Ram

""
He has thus raised the query as to why the S E M was not uh
suggested by the defence that he had  not obtained endorsement of P W
number five Dr Miss 
Krisnaram Ram 
""
What is the uhm necessity of obtaining endorsement of Dr uh uh 
 ?
""
P W number three has also stated that the deceased was uh uh

condition the patient will be  in a position to speak and that according
to him 
uh in his evidence

He has also canvassed  uhn before this court that uh P W number
two the mother of the deceased who uh  also states that the patient was in
a position to speak 
""
There is no suggestion made by the defence to P W number one and

Uh he has then canvassed before this court that this court shall
also consider the conduct of the accused 
""
That the accused has reported the incident to P W number two 
the mother of the deceased after going to her house  and then telling that
he would bring some money for medicine and went away and he did not return
""
""
The learned special P P has then canvassed before this court as to
why the accused ran away on the  pretext of uh bringing uh money from uh
for medicine 
""
 him
the accused had not 
the offence of throwing the uh  lighted match-stick on the person of the
deceased
""
He would not have uh 
""
Uh he has also canvassed before this court that the deceased had
""
which uh  which according to learned special P P is third dying

He has also invited the attention of this court that the deceased
had uh  uh
""
""

""
The learned special P P has then canvassed before this court
regarding the  exhibit A that is the scene of
offence uh of  which is the nature of corroborative
evidence on as the article uh 
match-box etcetera that is in all six articles  recovered and
had shown in  in exhibit eighteen that there was kerosene on these
articles 
""
Lastly the learned special P P has canvassed before this court 
that all the threee dying declarations are consistent and uhm  there is no
different version in this respect 
""
Uh according to him each one of the dying declaration is sufficient
to prove the guilt of the accused uh 
""
He has also canvassed before this court that about the conduct of
the accused that uh 
hospital  that it is the accused
only who is uh  this offence
""
He has also canvassed before this court  that the neighbours of
the deceased removed the deceased to K E M hospital and not the accused as it
should 
""
The learned special P P therefore has  uh seriously
urged  charge beyond a reasonable doubt against
the accused and that the accused 
""
Miss  clears
troat 
 that there is no direct eye
witness to the incident
""
She has canvassed before this court that the accused was charged
for the offence under section three nought seven I P C 
""
And that the charge uh  appears to have been uh altered to
section three nought two uh I P C 
""
She has also canvassed before this court that this is a case of
circumstantial evidence 
""
She has also canvassed before this court that  on the first
dying declaration recorded by P W number one  there is no endorsement of
the doctor  to the effect that the deceased was in a position to speak and
to make the dying declaration 
""
She has also canvassed before this court that the doctors
endorsement is necessary to show  that patient was in a position to speak
""
The second uh point which the learned defence council has canvassed
before this court is about  uh procuring of kerosene bottle which
according to her 
""
Uh the  showed that the plastic was
containing kerosene
""
The learned defence council  relied on the evidence of P W
number two and has stated  that the deceased poured kerosene uh from the
kerosene lamp article four
""
The learned defence council further canvassed before this court 
that regarding the seizure of articles  article number
three ought to have been  burnt if the deceased had burn injuries from
chest to abdomen 
""
However according to the learned defence council looking to the
evidence of P W number one to five  she has canvassed that the blouse
article three is not burnt but it is torn 
""
She has also invited the attention of this 
 in this
case and raised the query as to how two  are taken
charge of 
""
The deceased cannot  sarees
 at one and the same time
""
Therefore according to her  it creates doubt about this case in
view of the  by the
prosecution
