""
""
Now you stand up  ?
""
Tell me what is this  ?
""
""
Bamboo 
""
""
This  ?
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Sit down 
""
How are these two things prepared  ?
""
""
By 
""
""
With the help of what  ?
""
""
Bamboo 
""
""
Bamboo  isn't it ?
""
And also with the help of 
means of  production
""
What is the means of production  ?
""
How they are prepared ?
""
 as
already told
""
But how ?
""
With the help of what ?
""
""
Teacher with 
""
""
Teacher no teacher 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And these  ?
""
""
Teacher 
""
""
These these
""
""
With the help of what ?
""
""
Machines 
""
""
So 
machine  hands
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now let us see 
 machine age
started  ?
""
Machine age started  and then how this industrial revolution
started  ?
""
""
""
So let us take up now this industrial revolution  BB- Work
""
""
Industrial 
""
First of all let us study  the meaning of industrial revolution
""
""
Meaning 
""
There are you see just 
""
""
Man has passed through several stages  ?
""
In its economic growth he has passed through several stages 
""
First he was  moving from one place to
another 
""
Then he started  then
he started having so many other activities  ?
""
So that way  was engaging
himself in one or  ?
""
""
""
""
""
 order to progress
""
""
In order to progress and in order to satisfy his needs 
isn't it  ?
""
In the primitive stage he used to 
""
Only stones were at his disposal  ?
""
So he was  preparing instruments out of
it 
""
You know how he made fire as you know by friction and everything
you know
""
And the other weapons also he made out of  stones
""
And then  making use of
wood
""
Wooden plough and wooden 
""
Understood no ?
""
So why he prepared all those things ?
""
In order to satisfy his 
""
""
""
""
""
That was his prime necessity
""
Satisfying his 
""
""
""
""
""
As the time passed 
""
There is a  difference
between  in
the present age 
""
Our  needs
are vast  unlimited
""
But whereas in the past they had only limited 
""
As he has  an
 thinking animal
""
With the help of his thinking 
capacity 
 discoveries
""
He started inventing new things  new lands
""
""
So that way he progressed well 
""
So in the eighteenth century  in some parts of the world
""
Let us uh refer to those parts later on
""
Some parts of the world 
""
""
They started preparing machines 
""
New inventions  machines they started
""
""
You may be having 
""
What type of machines and all were produced 
""
But if you just said the meaning of the industry here
""
Industry means  even prior to eighteenth century there were
industries  ?
""
There were industries and they were producing so many things
""
 example of the same kind this
basket and 
 here
""
""
""
""
""
They used to prepare 
bronze copper gold silver
""
They used to prepare no 
""
Even that can also be called as industry 
""
Understood ?
""
What  telling you are getting the point no ?
""
""
Yes teacher
""
""
But yet this industrial revolution which started in the
eighteenth century was completly different from that of the previous idea of
industry 
""
 the meaning literal meaning
""
If you just referred to the dictionary it will show you that 
industry is nothing but 
""
Whereas this industrial revolution is completely different 
""
It increased the production 
""
New inventions were made
""
""
large scale 
""
Not only that it changed the pattern of the society 
""
Way of life of the people 
""
Understood no ?
""
 you have studied
""
The meaning of the revolution you know
""
Complete change in the way of life of the people 
""
 changed
the life of the people completely
""
Society itself was changed 
""
Did you understand ?
""
That is the meaning of 
""
Change in the 
and 
""
So now  not a
sudden movement
""
It didn't occur within  one
 month or within two months
""
""
""
In the eighteenth century 
""
In 
it spread all over the world 
""
First it started in England  other parts
""
""
Even now also industrial revolution is not complete 
""
In India and China the industrial revolution started  in
nineteenth century 
""
Whereas 
""
In some of the African countries it has started just now
""
That means even now also the process of industrial revolution is
going on
""
It is not complete 
""
Some countries like England America  they
have achieved full progress  as far as industrial
development is concerned 
""
Now next topic 
""
Factors favouring an industrial revolution 
""
Some eight points are there
""
Eight factors  which generally favour an industrial revolution
""
First one is 
""
Increasing trade and discovery of new markets 
""
You know 
""
In the twentieth century only these two countries  America
 Russia is disintegrated now
""
U S S R is disintegrated 
""
But 
""
""
 become poor
""
I mean uh 
""
But prior to that 
Britain was superpower like 
""
You can't call it super though but it 
""
Britain 
""
And it had control 
 several parts of the world
""
It  all
over the world 
""
Our India was also one of the colony 
""
And they were successful  continent Asia
Africa and European countries
""
They acquired so many territories  were
 under them
""
They were powerful 
""
So 
""
As they were having  there was increasing
demand for products 
""
You know  the
Britishers colonial policy 
""
They didn't allow any industries or any progress to occur in a
colonial state 
""
 in the colonies there was increasing
demand for 
""
Finished product 
""
Then increasing trade also
""
As they had so many colonies  increase
 with those
 colonies
""
Then 
""
They were not happy with whatever 
""
""
Who are going for more and more colonies ?
""
""
England 
""
""
 European
countries especially 
""
""
""
""
""
Then second factor that favoured the industrial revolution is
""
""
Prior to industrial revolution they used to prepare the goods with
the help of hands 
""
You know  ?
""
In order to prepare 
basket  more than one hour no
 ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
But this type of sturdier ones 
steel cups 
""
""
 this type of
cups more than thousands 
""
They can produce with the help of machine isn't it  ?
""
So that way the  time
they were planning to  have such a machine which produced more things
within limited time 
""
So that way what happened is  need to change the productive
process start 
""
They wanted to change  the means
of production 
""
Next 
""
These discoveries
""
You know the difference between discoveries and inventions ?
""
I think so 
""
Can you tell me  what is the difference between the
inventions and discoveries ?
""
""
Inventions means uh  inventing a completely new thing and
discovery means to discover  uh a land
""
""
To find out the land which is already  existing
""
""
No
""
Not known
""
""
""
""
""
It is already existing but unknown to the rest of the world
""
That is discovery
""
Invention means ?
""
It is no just like  was not
at all there  that
we call as 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then next is  this discovery is you know
""
In eighth standard you have studied about the  geographical
discovery
""
So many  land routes and lands
were 
Megallan and so many other sailors you have studied all this
""
""
""
""
""
And  as far
as inventions are 
""
That we are going to study in detail in the next chapter again 
""
So that way discovery and inventions also should be there
""
That also favours industrial revolution
""
Next fourth factor is  capital needed for producing machines
""
""
See in order to have a factory or 
industry 
crores 
we need isn't it  ?
""
So that  for the poor
country 
""
So only  few countries like England were accumulating
capital on large scale
""
So that was 
also one of the important factor that favoured the industrial revolution 
""
Next fifth one 
""
An atmosphere conducive to the freedom of thought 
""
If you  I'll
 give you
""
If I just scold you and beat you and if I make you only whatever I
am asking you 
I am dictating  you
that  study
""
If I tell like that then I am curbing  your capacity
to think
""
You won't think then you will become only copycats 
""
There is no work
""
There is no opportunity for your  uh uhm intelligence
""
Understood no ?
""
To show your intelligence there is no scope 
""
So  whereas if free atmosphere is given then you will come with
new ideas no  ?
""
So that will lead  in some of the countries that is
specially England  it started first
""
Industrial revolution first statred  in England no ?
""
They had free atmosphere that is democratic atmosphere  they
had 
""
 because of this
atmosphere  they could think freely and they could find out new
things and they could 
""
Sixth one is availability of coal and iron 
""
In order to have industry  two essential factors
first one is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
With the help of iron you can make so many things
""
Machines and other articles  and then
steel can also be made  help of
iron 
""
Then  is also equally
essential 
""
For what ?
""
Advani  ?
""
He is not attentive 
""
I am asking you coal is also essential in industrial development
""
How is it essential ?
""
And how is it useful  ?
""
What is coal you know  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  ?
""
""
""
""
""
 in
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  ?
""
Yes use  ?
""
""
For producing thermal energy 
""
""
For heating the 
particles in
""
""
 for
generating N H 
""
So in order to run the machines power is essential no ?
""
Power is essential  can be
 obtained by heating the coal
""
Run with the help of the  coal
""
We can obtain the power to run the machines so that these two
things were also available in England 
""
 have a skilled labour to handle a machine
""
If you have visited any 
""
""
They have so many divisions 
 fitting this
that
""
So many  you no ?
""
So that way 
""
To handle this each department they should 
have  skilled labours who are having some technical know-how
regarding that paticular department 
""
That is essential 
""
Otherwise it will be like 
""
In one  no
""
means there is no excellence
""
You won't expect any excellence in that 
""
So for  one field
only for example if you take welding  and you will become perfect in that
particular field
