<I>
Today we are study studying
 about
rotation and revolution of the earth 
I believe you know there are two forces two 
motions of the
earth 
One is on its own axis and the other is 
?
Around the sun
Around the sun 
The motion on its own axis is known as 
 Noise 
What is known that motion is known as 
 BB- Work
 rotation of the earth 
Earth 
And the movement of the earth round the sun 
 is
known as 
 Revolution 
Revolution of the
Earth
Earth 
Now what time does the earth take to take 
one turn on its
axis ?
Twenty-four hours
Twenty-four hours 
Is your answer complete ?
Twenty-four hours or less than that ?
Sir twenty-four hours 
It is twenty-four hours with reference to the
sun 
But if you take it with reference to
any other star
 then it will be less than twenty four hours
 
 Twenty-four hours 
Say for example this one here 
We are taking this as a reference point this
side 
And then want wanted this much
 in
twenty-four hours
In less than twenty-four hours
But in twenty-four hours what happens ?
The earth moves a little around the earth
Because in three sixty-five days the earth has to
Complete 
Complete one movement 
 Twenty-four hours 
So naturally one day if it is a three
hundred and sixty
degrees BB-Work 
Then one day roughly we have three sixty 
BB-Work five
days BB-Work 
But let us say this is three hundred and sixty
degrees then
 it will take roughly uh four minutes less
 than
twenty-four hours 
Because in but we find actually uh 
say every
fourth year is a big year is a leap
year 
Leap year 
Means one day is added and in one day
 we say the
earth takes one turn but this is with reference to any
particular say
this window in this case 
So with reference to window but in one day
the earth has
advanced a little and this way second day uh say two
minutes third
day three minutes and this way in one year three
hundred and sixty
degrees
It has moved round the sun 
So naturally if we take this this way three
sixty degrees that
is one minute or better put it this way BB-Work
If it is three sixty degree also means BB Work
 in one day
 one degree 
One degree makes a difference in time of
four minutes 
 BB Work 
We have noted fifteen degrees making a
difference of BB
Work one hour BB-Work 
 One hour 
So one degree will make a difference of how
many minutes ?
Four minutes 
Two 
Four minutes BB Work 
Fifteen degree divided uh say BB work
 sixty
minutes sixty sixty minutes dividing this so
 four
minutes 
 Sixty 
 Four minutes 
So one degree makes a difference of four
minutes
Four minutes
Means every day the earth has to turn 
one degree
 in order to face the sun 
Suppose it is here this day next day it will turn
this 
Next day again this much 
This much 
One degree every day BB- Work 
So with reference to any other star our
day is less
than twenty-four hours and that is 
twenty-three hours and
 Twenty-four hours 
Half of
Fifty-four minutes 
Twenty-three hours and fifty-four minutes 
BB-work 
So what is this state ?
A day of twenty-three hours and fifty-four
minutes 
That is called sideral day BB-Work
Sideral day 
One degree less than twenty-four hours and
then we have
another solar day that is of twenty-four hours
 that is of twenty-four hours 
So we have two kinds of days one with
reference to any
other star of universe twenty-three hours fifty-four
minutes 
and we have another day with reference to the sun that is of
 twenty 
 four hours BB-Work 
 Twenty-four hours 
You also know that the earth's 
axis is inclined
 towards BB-Work 
The earth is moving round the sun and the
 earth's
 axis with reference to the plane of orbit or
orbital plane 
also called elliptical plane or plane of ecliptic
 BB-Work
Plane of elliptic 
This is an imaginary plane 
Let us say this table is a plane and
 on this plane
 the earth's axis is inclined this way 
Like this here 
So this is an imaginary plane in this case here
 near the
table 
But in that space a plane like this is there
 and the
earth is occupying this kind of position and then sun in
the middle 
So with reference to this imaginary plane that is
 plane of
ecliptic 
Plane of ecliptic 
Ecliptic BB-Work 
The plane with reference to the plane of ecliptic
 or orbital
plane BB- Work 
The earth's axis is inclined how
many degrees ?
Let us say this is the plane of ecliptic 
and it is like
this BB-Work 
So this inclination how many degrees ?
Cannot be ninety 
Forty 
Forty-five degrees
Fifty fifty
 Fif 
This is 
Forty-five degrees 
 Sixty-six and half degrees 
Sixty-six and half degrees BB-Work 
Like this 
If this is the plane of ecliptic this point see
this 
BB-Work 
This is exactly here if you put it this way
 
BB-Work 
Much inclined
From vertical it will be twenty-three and half
 BB-
Work 
This is sixty-six and half BB-Work 
and this is 
twenty-three and a half BB-Work 
Together ninety degrees 
So with reference to the plane of ecliptic 
the 
earth's axis has an inclination of sixty-six and
half degrees
But when you take it from perpendicular this is the
plane of
ecliptic then perpendicular then from there if you take
this angle then
it will be twenty-three and half 
So you can express it this way with reference
to the plane of
ecliptic the earth's axis BB-Work has
an inclination
of sixty-six and half degrees 
But from perpendicular drawn from the plane of
ecliptic 
the earth's axis has an inclination of 
twenty-three and half
 degrees 
 Twenty-three and half 
Now there is a one question 
 BB- Work
Here BB-Work say this is the
plane of ecliptic
 BB-Work 
We have a arc BB-work here 
BB-Work 
And we have this inclination BB-Work
 
You might have studied this kind of things
sometimes 
BB-Work 
Must have you studied 
Four positions of the earth BB-Work 
round the 
sun 
So sometimes you find this kind of 
diagram 
BB-Work also sometimes you find BB-Work 
this kind of
diagram BB-Work 
Also sometimes you find BB-Work this
kind of diagram
Now which one is correct ?
Sir 
The first one because of the
Why do you say the first one is correct ?
Give arguments 
 One word 
Now let us see and one more 
BB-Work 
When you have like this ?
 A few words 
 BB-Work 
Why ?
 A few words 
Sir earth is the 
May be slanting
The earth's axis is inclined
Inclined 
Uh 
Uh
With reference to the pe at twenty
Twenty-three
And half it has perpendicular
From perpendicular 
From the axis
Here what is the case ?
Um revolves uh but
Yes ?
The axis of the earth is uh 
revolved
What do we mean by sixty-six and half
degrees from the
plane of ecliptic BB-Work 
This is the plane of ecliptic for our purpose here
We are measuring this 
This is imaginary now remember 
Here we have salved it so sixty-six
and half 
If we put it here is it not sixty-six and half
 ? 
BB-Work 
Measure this angle BB-Work because
this is plane 
imaginary so measure from here 
Is it not sixty-six and half ?
Yes it is 
If you put it here 
Again the difference again after the
You measure from this side 
So it may also be there
Yes sir 
So what about this ?
Is it correct ?
This is correct at least because we put it this way
Yes sir 
So it's like this
The position has changed
So this is correct 
Right ?
Yes sir 
If you put it this way what is wrong ?
 BB-Work 
Measure from this side 
One sixty-six and half 
You put it here 
Measure from this side sixty-six and half 
From here same thing sixty-six and half
So is it not correct ? BB-Work 
This much 
Why do you say that this is correct this is wrong ?
 One or two words 
And what about this ?
Look at this one 
Twenty-three and half degree and with a
correct size
Correct 
But where do you find twenty-three and half degrees
 or
sixty-six and half degrees
Do you find here ?
But it is 
How ?
Let us see 
Here put it this way sixty-six and half
degrees but from
your side it is appearing perpendicular
Perpendicular
But it is at sixty-six and half 
Is it at ?
It is at sixty-six and half 
Not
Here also sixty-six and half 
But from your side it appears perpendicular
Uhm 
So one way this is also correct 
But what about this ? BB-Work 
Some are like this some are like this 
So what is needed they all must be 
 inclined
 in the same direction 
 Inclined 
 Direction 
They must be inclined in the same
direction 
 Same direction 
But otherwise all these three are
correct 
How many days the earth or what time the
earth takes
to take one round around the sun ?
Sir days or days
Days or time better say time 
 Sir three sixty-five days 
Three sixty-five days
Three sixty-five days 
Is it ? BB-Work 
Yes sir 
Once a year 
Once a year 
 BB-Work 
Because we have a longer year after four years
So it it is also one
fourth 
BB-Work of a day 
 Noise Long pause 
Now let us see if this is the position
 of four
positions of the earth round the sun 
Then you also know that two days in a year 
the sun's
 vertical rays strikes at the equator 
We have noted 
Two days in a year 
What are those days ?
Yes
December twenty-second noise 
 BB-Work 
Two days in a year the sun's 
vertical rays 
strikes at the equator 
Means the days and nights are equal all over
the world 
Sir sir twenty-second December 
Twenty-second December and it is also in the
 one or two
words 
When do we have longest day in
India or here ?
Twenty-first twenty-one twenty-second June
twenty-second
Let us take twenty-second BB-Work
 June
Sir twenty-first June BB-Work 
Okay twenty-first June BB Work 
The day is longest in northern hemisphere 
Means where does the wait let us say take
also when
do we have the shortest day ?
Sir January twenty-second December 
February 
 Exactly the after six months 
 Sir twenty-second December 
Sir twenty-first Jan
It should exactly be after six months
 Exactly after six months 
Sir Twenty-first Jan
It should exactly be after six months 
So it cannot be January 
Sir December 
Sir December sir December
What date ?
Twenty-second December
December twenty second okay BB work
Sometimes uh one also writes twenty-third 
December 
So from twenty-fourth December bada din
 
BB work 
We have Christmas on twenty-fifth 
So say it may also be twenty-third December
 BB Work
So this is summer season in India 
This is summer BB work 
Summer of northern hemisphere BB work 
This is winter of 
Northern hemisphere 
 Northern hemisphere BB
Work 
Now you tell when do we have 
vertical rays shining
at the equator 
It must be also in between 
So what may be the dates ?
When the sun's vertical rays fall 
or strike 
on the equator or at the equator ? BB Work 
Sir March 
Twenty-third March 
 BB Work 
Twenty-second twenty-third 
twenty-first 
 Twenty-first March 
March 
Any other day ?
No sir
No sir
Sir March fifth 
After six months what date it may be ?
Sir September September twenty-second
 So twenty-second September 
Twenty-second September
 BB Work 
Now if this is the case where will you put 
these days 
Four days we have now BB work 
One BB work this BB work
 here 
BB work here BB work 
Put it this way BB work one two three
 BB
work and four BB work 
Where will you put twenty-second December 
?
What happens on twenty-second December ?
Where does the vertical uh ray of
the sun 
strike ?
At the tropic of cancer at the tropic of
capricorn ?
Capricorn 
So this is tropic of capricorn vertical
rays striking
here 
And the southern hemisphere south pole has 
day for
six months BB work 
See here BB work 
 Sun's rays are vertical at the
tropic of
capricorn 
Yes
And all these areas are under sunlight 
So this position will be from which
date ?
Twenty-second December 
 December 
 BB Work 
What is the position here ? BB work 
Sir twenty-third uh twenty-first June
Twenty-first June 
Right
Sir ternty-second June
Okay twenty-second June BB work 
It all depends upon because sometime you have leap
year sometime
you do not have
So it may be twenty-first it may be twenty-second
And sometime people even write twenty-third 
So that doesn't make much difference
