Today we are  studying
""
""
""
""
motions of the
""
""
One is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is known 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the movement of the earth round the sun 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
axis ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Is your  answer complete ?
""
Twenty-four hours  ?
""
""
""
""
""
It is twenty-four hours with reference to the
""
""
But if  reference to
""
 twenty four hours
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We are taking this as a reference point  this
""
""
And then  this much
""
""
""
In less than twenty-four hours
""
But  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
hundred and sixty
degrees 
""
""
BB-Work  five
days 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 we say the
""
""
""
""
""
the earth has
""
minutes third
""
hundred and sixty
""
""
It has 
""
So naturally if we take  this this way three
""
is one minute  BB-Work
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We have noted fifteen degrees  making a
""
Work 
""
""
""
""
""
So one degree will make a difference of how
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Fifteen degree divided  BB work
""
minutes  sixty minutes dividing this so
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This much 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Half of
""
""
Fifty-four minutes 
""
""
BB-work 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sideral day 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we have two kinds of  with
""
other star  twenty-three hours fifty-four
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You also know 
axis is inclined
""
""
""
""
""
""
also called  or plane of ecliptic
""
""
""
""
""
This is an imaginary plane 
""
Let us say  and
 on this plane
""
""
""
""
So this is an imaginary plane  in this case here
""
table 
""
But in that space  a plane like this is there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Plane of ecliptic 
""
""
Ecliptic 
""
The plane with reference to the plane of ecliptic
 or orbital
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
this 
""
""
This is exactly  put it this way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 BB-
""
""
""
and this is 
""
""
Together 
""
""
the 
""
""
""
""
""
plane of
""
this angle then
""
""
""
to the plane of
""
an inclination
""
""
But  from perpendicular drawn from the plane of
""
the 
twenty-three and half
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 BB- Work
""
""
Here  this is the
""
""
""
""
BB-Work 
""
""
""
""
You might have studied this kind of things
""
BB-Work 
""
Must have 
""
Four positions of the earth 
""
sun 
""
So sometimes you find 
diagram 
""
this kind of
""
""
Also sometimes you find  this
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir 
""
""
""
""
""
Why do you say the first one is correct  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Sir earth is the 
""
""
""
""
""
The  axis is inclined
""
""
Inclined 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Twenty-three
""
""
And half it has perpendicular
""
""
From perpendicular 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Here we have  so sixty-six
""
""
If we put it here  is it not sixty-six and half
""
BB-Work 
""
""
""
imaginary 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If you put it here 
""
""
Again the difference again after the
""
""
You measure from this side 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Is it correct  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right ?
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
From here  same thing sixty-six and half
""
So is it not correct 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And what about this  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 or
""
""
Do you find here  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Let us see 
""
""
degrees  but from
""
""
""
""
""
""
But it is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So one way this is also correct 
""
""
""
Some are like this 
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They must be inclined in the  same
direction 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
earth  takes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Is it 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Once a year 
""
""
Once a year
