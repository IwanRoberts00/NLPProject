Today we are  studying
 about
rotation and revolution of the earth 
""
I believe you know there are two forces 
motions of the
earth 
""
One is 
?
""
""
Around the sun
""
""
Around the sun 
""
The 
""
""
""
""
""
What is known 
 BB- Work
""
""
""
Earth 
""
""
And the movement of the earth round the sun 
 is
known as 
""
""
""
""
""
Revolution of the
""
""
Earth
""
""
Earth 
""
Now what time 
one turn on its
axis ?
""
""
Twenty-four hours
""
""
Twenty-four hours 
""
""
Is your  answer complete ?
""
Twenty-four hours  ?
""
""
Sir twenty-four hours 
""
""
It is twenty-four hours with reference to the
sun 
""
But if  reference to
any other star
 twenty four hours
""
""
""
""
""
""
Say for example 
""
We are taking this as a reference point  this
side 
""
And then  this much
 in
twenty-four hours
""
In less than twenty-four hours
""
But  ?
""
The earth  around the earth
""
""
Because in three sixty-five days the earth has to
""
""
Complete 
""
""
Complete one 
""
""
""
""
""
So naturally  one day if it is a three
hundred and sixty
degrees 
""
Then 
BB-Work  five
days 
""
But let us say this is three hundred and sixty
degrees  then
 uh four minutes less
 than
twenty-four hours 
""
Because in 
say  every
fourth year  is a leap
year 
""
""
Leap year 
""
""
Means  and in one day
 we say the
earth takes one turn  but this is with reference to any
particular say
this window in this case 
""
So with reference to window  in one day
the earth has
advanced a little  uh say two
minutes third
day  three
hundred and sixty
degrees
""
It has 
""
So naturally if we take  this this way three
sixty degrees that
is one minute  BB-Work
""
""
If it is three sixty degree also means  BB Work
 in one day
""
""
One degree makes a difference  of
four minutes 
""
""
We have noted fifteen degrees  making a
difference of  BB
Work 
""
""
""
""
""
So one degree will make a difference of how
many minutes  ?
""
""
Four minutes 
""
""
Two 
""
""
Four minutes 
""
Fifteen degree divided  BB work
 sixty
minutes  sixty minutes dividing this so
 four
minutes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So one degree makes a difference of  four
minutes
""
""
Four minutes
""
""
Means 
one degree
""
""
Suppose it is here this day next day it will turn
this 
""
Next day again this much 
""
This much 
""
One degree every day 
""
So  our
day is  less
than 
twenty-three hours and
""
""
""
""
""
""
Half of
""
""
Fifty-four minutes 
""
Twenty-three hours and fifty-four minutes 
BB-work 
""
So what is this state  ?
""
A day of twenty-three  hours and fifty-four
minutes 
""
That is called  BB-Work
""
""
Sideral day 
""
One degree  and
then we have
another  twenty-four hours
""
""
So we have two kinds of  with
reference to  any
other star  twenty-three hours fifty-four
minutes 
and we have another day with reference to the sun that is of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You also know 
axis is inclined
""
""
The earth is  and the
 earth's
 or
orbital plane 
also called  or plane of ecliptic
 BB-Work
""
""
Plane of 
""
This is an imaginary plane 
""
Let us say  and
 on this plane
""
""
Like this 
""
So this is an imaginary plane  in this case here
 near the
table 
""
But in that space  a plane like this is there
 the
earth is occupying this kind of position  and then sun in
the middle 
""
So with reference to this imaginary plane that is
 plane of
ecliptic 
""
""
Plane of ecliptic 
""
""
Ecliptic 
""
The plane with reference to the plane of ecliptic
 or orbital
plane 
""
The  how
many degrees  ?
""
Let us say this is 
and it is like
this 
""
So this inclination  ?
""
Cannot be ninety 
""
""
Forty 
""
""
Forty-five degrees
""
""
Fifty fifty
""
""
""
""
""
This is 
""
""
Forty-five 
""
""
""
""
Sixty-six and half degrees 
""
Like this 
""
If this is  the plane of ecliptic this point see
this 
BB-Work 
""
This is exactly  put it this way
""
BB-Work 
""
""
Much inclined
""
""
From vertical it will be twenty-three and half
 BB-
Work 
""
This is sixty-six and half 
and this is 
twenty-three and a half 
""
Together 
""
So with 
the 
earth's  sixty-six and
half degrees
""
""
But when you take it from perpendicular this is the
plane of
ecliptic then perpendicular  then from there if you take
this angle then
it will be 
""
So you can express it this way  with reference
to the plane of
ecliptic the  has
an inclination
of sixty-six and half degrees 
""
But  from perpendicular drawn from the plane of
ecliptic 
the 
twenty-three and half
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now there is a 
 BB- Work
""
""
Here  this is the
plane of ecliptic
""
""
We have a arc 
BB-Work 
""
And we have  BB-Work
""
""
You might have studied this kind of things
sometimes 
BB-Work 
""
Must have 
""
Four positions of the earth 
round the 
sun 
""
So sometimes you find 
diagram 
BB-Work 
this kind of
diagram 
""
Also sometimes you find  this
kind of diagram
""
""
Now which one  ?
""
""
Sir 
""
""
The  first one because of the
""
""
Why do you say the first one is correct  ?
""
Give arguments 
""
""
""
""
""
Now let us see 
BB-Work 
""
When you have like this  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Sir earth is the 
""
""
May be  slanting
""
""
The  axis is inclined
""
""
Inclined 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Uh
""
""
With reference to the  at twenty
""
""
Twenty-three
""
""
And half it has perpendicular
""
""
From perpendicular 
""
""
From the axis
""
""
Here  ?
""
""
Um  uh but
""
""
Yes  ?
""
""
The axis of the earth 
revolved
""
""
What do we mean by  sixty-six and half
degrees from the
plane of ecliptic 
""
This is the plane of ecliptic for our purpose here
""
""
We are measuring this 
""
This is imaginary now remember 
""
Here we have  so sixty-six
and half 
""
If we put it here  is it not sixty-six and half
""
BB-Work 
""
Measure this angle  because
this is plane 
imaginary 
""
Is it not sixty-six and half  ?
""
""
Yes it is 
""
""
If you put it here 
""
""
Again the difference again after the
""
""
You measure from this side 
""
So it may also be there
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
So what about this  ?
""
Is it correct  ?
""
This is correct at least because we put it this way
""
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
So  like this
""
""
The position has changed
""
""
So this is correct 
""
Right ?
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
If you put it this way what is wrong  ?
""
""
Measure from this side 
""
One sixty-six and half 
""
You put it here 
""
Measure from this side 
""
From here  same thing sixty-six and half
""
So is it not correct 
""
This much 
""
Why do you say that this is correct this is wrong ?
""
""
""
""
""
And what about this  ?
""
Look at this one 
""
""
Twenty-three and half degree and  with a
correct size
""
""
Correct 
""
But where do you find twenty-three and half degrees
 or
sixty-six and half degrees
""
Do you find here  ?
""
But it is 
""
How  ?
""
Let us see 
""
Here put it this way  sixty-six and half
degrees  but from
your side it is appearing  perpendicular
""
""
Perpendicular
""
""
But it is 
""
Is it at ?
""
It is at sixty-six and half 
""
""
Not
""
""
Here also sixty-six and half 
""
But from your side it appears perpendicular
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So one way this is also correct 
""
But what about this 
""
Some are like this 
""
So 
 inclined
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They must be inclined in the  same
direction 
""
""
""
""
""
""
But  these three are
correct 
""
How many days the earth  the
earth  takes
to take one round  ?
""
""
Sir days or  days
""
""
Days or time 
""
""
""
""
""
Three sixty-five days
""
""
Three sixty-five days 
""
Is it 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Once a year 
""
""
Once a year 
""
""
""
""
Because we have  a longer year after four years
""
So  is also one
fourth 
BB-Work 
""
""
""
""
""
Now let us see  if this is the position
 four
positions of the earth 
""
Then you also know that 
the  sun's
""
""
We have noted 
""
Two days in a year 
""
What are  ?
""
""
Yes
""
""
December twenty-second 
""
""
""
""
Two days 
vertical rays 
strikes 
""
Means  the days and nights are equal all over
the world 
""
""
Sir sir twenty-second December 
""
""
Twenty-second December and it is also in the
 one or two
words 
""
""
When do we have  in
India  or here ?
""
""
Twenty-first twenty-one twenty-second June
twenty-second
""
""
Let us take twenty-second  BB-Work
 June
""
""
Sir twenty-first June 
""
""
Okay twenty-first June 
""
The day is longest in 
""
Means  wait let us say take
also  when
do we have the shortest day  ?
""
""
Sir January 
""
""
February 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir twenty-first Jan
""
""
It should exactly be  after six months
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir Twenty-first Jan
""
""
It should exactly be after 
""
So it cannot be January 
""
""
Sir December 
""
""
Sir December sir December
""
""
What date  ?
""
""
Twenty-second December
""
""
December twenty second okay  BB work
""
""
Sometimes 
December 
""
So from twenty-fourth December  bada din
""
BB work 
""
We have 
""
So  say it may also be twenty-third December
 BB Work
""
""
So 
""
This is summer 
""
Summer of northern hemisphere 
""
This is 
""
""
Northern 
""
""
 BB
Work 
""
Now you 
vertical rays shining
at the equator 
""
It must be also 
""
So what may be the dates  ?
""
When the 
or strike 
on the 
""
""
Sir March 
""
""
Twenty-third March 
""
""
""
""
Twenty-second 
twenty-first 
""
""
""
""
""
March 
""
""
Any other day  ?
""
""
No sir
""
""
No sir
""
""
Sir March fifth 
""
""
After six months  it may be ?
""
""
Sir September  September twenty-second
""
""
""
""
""
""
Twenty-second September
""
""
""
""
Now if this 
these days 
""
Four days we have now 
""
One  BB work
""
BB work 
""
Put it this way  three
 BB
work 
""
Where will you put twenty-second 
?
""
What happens on twenty-second December  ?
""
Where does  ray of
the sun 
strike  ?
""
At the  at the tropic of
capricorn  ?
""
""
Capricorn 
""
""
So this is  tropic of capricorn vertical
rays striking
here 
""
And the southern hemisphere 
day  for
six months 
""
See here 
""
 the
tropic of
capricorn 
""
""
Yes
""
""
And all these areas are under sunlight 
""
So  which
date  ?
""
""
Twenty-second 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is the position here 
""
""
Sir twenty-third uh  twenty-first June
""
""
Twenty-first June 
""
Right
""
""
Sir ternty-second June
""
""
Okay twenty-second June 
""
It all depends upon because sometime you have leap
year sometime
you do not have
""
So it may be twenty-first it may be twenty-second
""
""
And sometime people even write twenty-third 
""
So
