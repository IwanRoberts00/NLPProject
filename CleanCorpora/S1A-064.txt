Hello I am Usha 
And I am Rukmini 
Say tell whatever you want 
You studied 
 Studied have you studied for tomorrow's 
paper 
Oh no I have to 
And don't talk anything about the teachers because
professor Patil will be reading about it laughs 
I am scared about grammar what about you 
I am scared about linguistics because we have to be very
specific while writing the answers we have to study the definitions and
all that 
And I think grammar is worst 
But grammar we can apply what we have studied to something
Yeah but suppose we mistake in the class
I will oppose we will make mistakes
We will make mistakes
However we try good shot
 That's what I am scared of 
What are you planning to do after you go to Hyderabad 
After going there actually I didn't want to go 
They will force me to go and after going there I have to go to
the two words school and attend that uh youth
parliament 
How many days is the two days Parliament
 Two days 
 Two days 
 Two days July first and second 
And you booked your uh ticket from uh Hyderabad to 
two words 
Bangalore 
Bangalore 
So when will you be joining school 
On uh fifth 
Fifth of July 
Fifth of July 
And your girl daughter 
My girl is there in Bangalore 
My husband is there mother is there 
 She is in Bangalore 
So other day all of us will leave from Bangalore on fourth 
Uhm 
Fourth evening 
And uh then you can't take leave na 
once you join there
Yeah I cannot 
I must say in one way I am quite happy to go back to
school but then everything will start all at once 
And uh we cannot 
 House activities and teaching tests you
can't even take leave exact
And once we start we cannot uh no question of stopping in
 between also 
 No question of stop 
I thought actually that I would take some days off and take a
holiday but it's just not possible you know with 
And uh what about your uh that official order regarding
the consideration of this
No I don't have any such letter as yet for the time being
I am only given a letter saying these three days you know twenty-seven
twenty-eight twenty-nine I'll be considered on duty 
But it seems Neeta has Nivedita has uh letter 
 Yeah she has got a copy yeah of
her letter
Please pass it on because I have got one copy uh this Uma
wanted it
 Yeah 
Yeah I know even I'll send
It is the same letter we got at Hyderabad
Yeah Hyderabad 
Oh then I have given a copy of that
This Geeta had given it to me
Yeah yeah got it I had given a copy of that to school 
but uh they have to get clarification about that 
Who who has to get
The school authorities 
Yeah actually what happened was that in my case 
 Because that letter to me it's true
 copy
Yeah in my case what happened know they send this to the
Assistant Commissioner 
And then a letter come from that Assistant Commissioner saying that
 uh so many days can be treated as on duty 
 On duty 
So you will be given earned leave accordingly 
 Earned leave yeah 
 That's what uh even our principal wants to find
out but I think they won't find out we'll have to go back and
set out start the whole thing 
So he is not uh he will not 
No no I mean she is not refusing
Uhm 
But uh she won't write to the Assistant Commissioner 
 you know I mean unless I remind her 
 Why why 
 I think she's will do 
She will do it unless only if I remind her 
How is she 
She is okay I mean laughs 
No I tell you she rang me I mean know she has sent a letter 
Uhm
 To my house and I was supposed to go on the
sixteenth and it was for eleventh standard admission 
Oh god I tell you 
 Uh ha 
Now what about the twelfth standard results 
God knows I don't have any idea about school result
I haven't been to school 
I heard that in our shool the highest was eighty-four
percent the highest rank 
But uh how did you get the news 
Oh letter
 Two words 
Not letter before I came here no I went to our 
prinicpal's place and we had got the information from somewhere else
Uhm 
Like that I came to know 
Because I haven't botherd to ring up school and uh 
secondly there is nobody staying near my house 
Still I had asked Savita na her son is in our
school eleventh satandard 
Now in twelfth he he could find out from the neighbours and all
 but our one word must have forgotten also 
Everybody so worried about the exams and studies 
Now today Grace madam has aksed us to write that
uh 
 Go back 
Oh yeah oh god that
In about uh the 
We had suggested actually about practice teaching to 
our teachers only we had suggested that that they should have you know
first of all some sort of a syllabus even for that 
And the two teachers who teach should preferably teach as
a pair 
That is you know you start off a topic I continue and complete it
or something
Yes 
Instead of like one doing composition and other doing
poetry and thing like that 
Certainly you can write that again in hour 
Uh what day uh told was we talked about this
to Julka madam 
 Study 
Uhm 
And then uh she was telling that uh this kind of a
thing would actually limit the scope of a teacher 
Like if we prescribe a syllabus we will have to adhere to the
syllabus and so we cannot uh 
True but see they are not very happy when we do poetry
 or prose
Yes
Isn't it 
So why not nea completely eliminate that all together
 because one side you also have to see the learners 
They have come for some particular course 
Yeah one word 
And you are sort of just throwing anything at them which you
 find conveninent and then plus the tutors are going to turn
around and say that of what use was this to the learner
And at the same no that's what she told when uh
 a question was raised like this last time 
I think others uh proficiency classes by the faculty members
 uhm it was started just uh two years back 
 It's because of this some other participant they
complained about this and uh then they started one word they
started this particular 
Method
Uhm 
Because such a one word 
So they'll benefit out of the faculty teaching
Uhm 
And notes
But even that is not fair no it's like we use them
for one hour as guinea pigs
Yeah 
Only for one hour they are taught by the other
professors 
No this way what will happen is we could try out new
techniques 
Otherwise poetry or prose we follow the old method 
Say we would uh get other variety you know like 
writing skills there are so many you can teach them 
And you may take up speaking skills listening skills I think
that area is big enough yeah no 
Areas which have not been touched upon till now 
 It's not really as for two words 
 yeah
You could easily do it and that one month would really
help them 
 It's not only one month it's a three
week course which they have 
And it will also give us the chance to try out new methods
Uh I am not very sure how many will go back 
Even means like I try out some methods but with the time
problem always over there you can't always have all kinds of new
methods to do cough 
So may be then secondly again like we had talked abot having
only one practice teaching instead of two 
It seems before they had three
Yeah I know that
And Julka ma'am was telling that they were lucky
because they could take the best two 
Best two 
Now here bu but when we told that here we have
to take only one
They should take but they are not doing that
They they are not doing that
They want to combine both and keep on the average
And people like me who got the first chance do you know it is
really difficult for us 
Uhn that's true 
No no
No then I think they could you know either start the
course a little earlier and give us say three four days to get used to
the idea or because though they send you material saying you must get
ready for your lesson when you don't know the learners 
I know
How will they prepare 
 And not only that they have told that they will
help us with the materials if we don't have any materials with us 
But here after having come here I don't think uh there was
 Nothing was available 
The library was not available 
 Uhn library uhn library facility was not there
 It's a big draw back and specially Jaikar is
quite a good library 
So I think we should have had the chance 
Though how much reading we would have done is anybody 
 anybody's guess
Yeah that's what uh 
Again classes bit too long I feel five O'clock
 is tiring 
And what happens when special classes are taken in between
Uhm
Some two to three
Three and all one word very sad thing 
You have to go quite a long way from here 
Yeah quite a way 
Uhn 
Uhm it's an hours journey no almost 
 You have one bus or you have to change the bus
 Two words 
No I have to change because there is no direct bus and
specially two words 
But at what time you start from home in the morning 
Today I started at about eight eight quarter past eight
because the exam is at ten 
The exam the classes were at nine then I left home by about
quarter to eight
Eight 
Okay because it will be now in the school they
haven't started 
And Marathi medium school timings are different so it's 
okay 
Otherwise it's a problem 
Like for my own shcool I leave my house at half past seven 
What about your school is it near your house
No not at all 
The same distance my house to the University the same distance
from my house to the school 
Another direction 
Completely 
Did you go to main street 
No no I have never gone anywhere 
 You didn't go shopping anywhere 
No 
I will be going on twenty-ninth twenty-ninth evening 
When when is your train 
Thirtieth 
Thirtieth evening 
Thirtieth evening 
Oh ho so you have to stay one day more 
I will be staying in my cousins place
Uhm 
So her mother is here she told she'll take
me for shopping
Uhm
And then after that next day we are going for sight seeing
What about this C I E F L Rama Matthew's 
evaluation 
Uhm I think they are starting that uh workshop from
 July fifth 
Something like two words this Uma's got
a letter my letter stuck in
I met Rama Matthew from here uh she had come here
actually 
When 
Uhm during the first week of her 
Course 
Uh course 
Uhm uhm no I didn't meet her when Rajni Badlani had
also come 
I don't know who visited that time uh she had gone to one
of the classes 
Uhm uhm 
Uh 
You mean
 One word lady with bobbed hair
Yeah yeah fair very fair 
 That women no 
And uh she drapes her saree like that
Yeah 
She doesn't one word 
Exactly she's Rama Mathews she is
Rama Mathew
 She is not very fair 
She is Rama Matthew
I met her at Hyderabad in December when we went for this
uh the R P training she had come over
 Two words 
It seems there is a letter which says that this workshop is
some something one word you 
 No but its not compulsory only if you 
 want you can come 
 No it's not compulsory but I would
like to go definitely but then 
 I told her I will be in Hydrebad till
second then she told you stay back for five more days 
I told that's very difficult from seventh May I have
been travelling
Yeah 
 It's really very difficult I am sorry 
She told okay it's okay uh any way you have done this
much 
I didn't do much you know I only did two uh ob 
uh observations
You sent the second one 
I sent both yeah both I sent 
But I couldn't observe any uh old class change 
Uh even I one word 
It isn't possible only the new nine 
And our school is also not so near to any other school you
know and with the main problem is that board exam is on my head 
so what happens is I cannot take a half day off and go and observe in other
schools 
But like this year if I have to do it I will try to be a
little bit more systematic 
Secondly more time that we came to know
So this year there will be tenth standard observation also
For the new tenth
For the new
And the new nineth
She told the materials will be sent by the end of July
Uhm no that's okay because you get August
September that time it came very late by the time I got that it
was settled 
 I got that even got that two words 
Even I got in the third week
Because no pro point in doing that
And by the time all the students had left for the study leave
and all that
All sorts of things yeah
So I wrote a letter immediately saying that I will not be
there
And when I sent mine I also wrote a letter saying this
problem is there and the two observation that also the first observation
I did in rough thinking I wouldn't be able to manage but it was okay 
So I sent it in rough with my report set up and uh second one
of course I did 
And you get the xerox uh done after sheet observation sheet
No no no
Then
