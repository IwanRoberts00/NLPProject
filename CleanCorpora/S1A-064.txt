Hello 
""
""
And I am Rukmini 
""
""
Say 
""
""
You 
""
""
""
paper 
""
""
Oh no I have to 
""
""
And don't talk anything about the teachers  because
professor Patil will be reading about it 
""
I am scared about grammar 
""
""
I am scared about linguistics  because we have to be very
specific while writing the  answers we have to study the definitions and
all that 
""
""
And I think grammar is worst 
""
""
But grammar we can apply what we have studied to something
""
""
Yeah but suppose we mistake  in the class
""
""
I will oppose  we will make mistakes
""
""
We will make mistakes
""
""
However we try good shot
""
""
""
""
What are you planning to do after you go to Hyderabad 
""
""
After going there 
""
They will force me to go  and after going there I have to go to
the  youth
parliament 
""
""
How many days is the  Parliament
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And you booked your uh 
two words 
""
""
Bangalore 
""
""
Bangalore 
""
So when will you be joining school 
""
""
On uh fifth 
""
""
Fifth of July 
""
""
Fifth of July 
""
""
And your girl 
""
""
My girl is there in Bangalore 
""
My husband is there 
""
""
""
""
""
So other day all of us will leave from Bangalore on fourth 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Fourth evening 
""
""
And uh 
once you join there
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
I must say  in one way I am quite happy to go back to
school but then 
""
""
And uh 
""
""
 you
can't even take leave  exact
""
""
And once we start we cannot uh  no question of stopping in
""
""
""
""
""
I thought actually that I would take some days off and  take a
holiday but 
""
""
And uh what about your  uh that official order regarding
the  consideration of this
""
""
No I don't have any such letter as yet  for the time being
I am only given a letter saying these three days  you know twenty-seven
twenty-eight twenty-nine 
""
But it seems Neeta has 
""
""
 of
her letter
""
Please pass it on  uh this Uma
wanted it
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah I know  send
""
It is the same letter we got at Hyderabad
""
""
Yeah Hyderabad 
""
""
Oh then I have given a copy of that
""
""
This Geeta had given it to me
""
""
Yeah yeah got it 
but uh they have to get clarification about that 
""
""
Who  who has to get
""
""
The school authorities 
""
""
Yeah actually what happened 
""
""
 true
 copy
""
""
Yeah in my case what happened know  they send this to the
Assistant Commissioner 
""
And then a letter come from that Assistant Commissioner saying that
""
""
""
""
""
So you will be given 
""
""
""
""
""
 even our principal wants to find
out  have to go back and
set out 
""
""
So he is not uh 
""
""
No no  I mean she is not refusing
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She will do it unless 
""
""
How is she 
""
""
She is okay 
""
No I tell you she rang me I mean know she has sent a letter 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
 and I was supposed to go on the
sixteenth 
""
Oh god 
""
""
""
""
""
Now what about the twelfth standard results 
""
""
God knows I don't have any idea  about school result
""
I haven't been to school 
""
""
I heard that in our shool  the highest was eighty-four
percent 
""
""
But uh 
""
Oh letter
""
""
""
""
""
Not letter 
prinicpal's  place and we had got the information from somewhere else
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Like that I came to know 
""
""
Because 
secondly there is nobody staying near my house 
""
Still I had asked Savita  her son is in our
school eleventh satandard 
""
Now in twelfth  he he could find out from the neighbours and all
""
""
Everybody so worried about the exams and studies 
""
""
Now today  madam has aksed us to write that
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Oh yeah  that
""
""
In about uh the 
""
""
We had suggested actually about practice teaching 
our teachers only we had suggested that  that they should have you know
first of all 
""
And the two teachers who teach  preferably teach as
a pair 
""
That is you know you start off a topic I continue and complete it
or something
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Instead of like one doing  composition and other doing
poetry and thing like that 
""
Certainly you can write that again in hour 
""
""
Uh what  told was we talked about this
to Julka madam 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And then uh  this kind of a
thing 
""
Like if we prescribe a syllabus  we will have to adhere to the
syllabus and so we cannot uh 
""
""
True  but see they are not very happy when we do poetry
 or prose
""
""
Yes
""
""
Isn't it 
""
So why not  completely eliminate that all together
""
""
They have come for some particular course 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And you are sort of just throwing anything at them which you
 plus the tutors are going to turn
around and say that  to the learner
""
""
And at the same  what she told when uh
""
""
I think others uh  proficiency classes by the faculty members
""
""
 some other participant they
complained about this  they
started this particular 
""
""
Method
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Because such a 
""
""
So  benefit out of the faculty teaching
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And notes
""
""
But even that is not fair no  like we use them
for one hour as guinea pigs
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Only for one hour they are taught by  the other
professors 
""
""
No this way what will happen is we could try out new
techniques 
""
Otherwise poetry or prose we follow the old method 
""
Say we would uh 
writing skills there are so many you can teach them 
""
And you may take up speaking skills listening skills  I think
that area is big enough 
""
""
Areas 
""
""
""
 yeah
""
""
You could easily do it  and that one month would really
help them 
""
""
 a three
week course which they have 
""
""
And it will also give us the chance to try out new methods
""
""
""
Uh I am not very sure how many will go back 
""
Even means like I try out some methods  but with the time
problem  all kinds of new
methods to do 
""
So may be  then secondly again like we had talked abot having
only one practice teaching instead of two 
""
""
It seems before they had three
""
""
Yeah I know that
""
""
And Julka  was telling that they were lucky
because they could take the best two 
""
""
Best two 
""
""
Now here  but when we told that here we have
to take only one
""
""
They should take  but they are not doing that
""
""
They they are not doing that
""
""
They want to combine both  and keep on the average
""
""
And people like me who got the first chance do you know it is
really difficult for us 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
No no
""
""
No then I think they could you know  either start the
course a little earlier  and give us say three four days to get used to
the idea  or because though they send you material saying you must get
ready for your lesson 
""
""
I know
""
""
How 
""
""
 they have told that they will
help us with the materials if we don't have any materials with us 
""
But here after having come here I don't think uh  there was
""
""
""
""
""
The 
""
""
 library facility was not there
""
""
 and specially Jaikar is
quite a good library 
""
So I think we should have had the chance 
""
Though how much reading we would have done is 
 guess
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Again classes  O'clock
""
""
""
And what happens when special classes are taken in between
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Some two to three
""
""
Three and all 
""
""
You have to go quite a long way from here 
""
""
Yeah quite a way 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
 one bus or you have to change the bus
""
""
""
""
""
""
No I have to change because there is no direct bus  and
specially 
""
""
But 
""
""
Today I started at about eight  eight quarter past eight
because the exam is at ten 
""
The exam the classes were at nine then I left home by about
quarter to eight
""
""
Eight 
""
""
Okay  they
haven't started 
""
And Marathi medium school timings are different so 
okay 
""
Otherwise 
""
Like for my own shcool I leave my house at half past seven 
""
""
What about your school is it near your house
""
""
No not at all 
""
The same distance my house to the University  the same distance
from my house to the school 
""
""
Another direction 
""
""
Completely 
""
Did you go to main street 
""
""
No no I have never 
""
""
""
""
""
No 
""
I will be going on twenty-ninth 
""
""
When when is your train 
""
""
Thirtieth 
""
""
Thirtieth evening 
""
""
Thirtieth evening 
""
""
Oh ho so you have to stay one day more 
""
""
I will be staying in my cousins place
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So  take
me for shopping
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And then after that next day we are going for sight seeing
""
""
""
What about this 
evaluation 
""
""
Uhm  workshop from
""
""
""
Something like  got
a letter  my letter stuck in
""
""
I met Rama Matthew from here  uh she had come here
actually 
""
""
When 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Course 
""
""
Uh course 
""
""
Uhm uhm  when Rajni Badlani had
also come 
""
""
I don't know who visited that time  uh she had gone to one
of the classes 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
You mean
""
""
 lady with bobbed hair
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
""
""
And uh  like that
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
She doesn't 
""
""
Exactly  she is
Rama Mathew
""
""
""
""
""
She is Rama Matthew
""
""
I met her  at Hyderabad in December when we went for this
uh  she had come over
""
""
""
""
""
It seems there is a letter which says that this workshop is
some 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 I would
like to go definitely 
""
""
 I will be in Hydrebad till
second then she told you stay back for five more days 
""
I told  seventh May I have
been travelling
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
She told okay  okay uh any way you have done this
much 
""
""
I didn't do much you know 
uh observations
""
""
You sent the second one 
""
""
I sent both 
""
But I couldn't observe any uh 
""
""
Uh even I 
""
""
It isn't possible only the new nine 
""
And  our school is also not so near to any other school you
know 
so what happens is I cannot take a half day off and go and observe in other
schools 
""
But like this year if  I will try to be a
little bit more systematic 
""
Secondly more time  that we came to know
""
""
So this year there will be tenth standard observation also
""
""
""
For the new tenth
""
""
For the new
""
""
And the new nineth
""
""
She told the materials will be sent by the  end of July
""
""
Uhm  okay because you get August
September that time it came very late  the time I got that it
was settled 
""
""
""
""
""
Even I got in the third week
""
""
Because no  point in doing that
""
""
And by the time all the students had left for the study leave
and all that
""
""
All sorts of things yeah
""
""
So I wrote a letter immediately saying that  I will not be
there
""
""
And when I sent mine I also wrote a letter saying this
problem is there  and the two observation that also the first observation
I did in rough 
""
So I sent it in rough with my report  set up and uh second one
of course I did 
""
And you get the xerox uh done after  sheet observation sheet
""
""
""
No no no
""
""
Then
