Principal  Suresh
Pendse  in
a most unexpected manner  Shri
 who is sitting just below me on the right hand side
 Patwardhan or Tatya Patwardhan
if not Tatyasaheb 
members of the staff of the English department of this college 
fellow participants  the method
or methods of teaching 
to the twelfth standard  who happen to join our college
""
""
When Prof  it may be pronounced as upper also you see
 saw me in my residence at Bombay
 and showed me the letter of the principal
""
I said see I am most innocent  of the
subject matter of your discussions or participations 
""
On my great teacher later on  have his I have something
to say about him 
""
Uh it was said of him that he had  in English we
don't say first class 
""
In English language and literature in the university of Oxford in
the year nineteen hundred and thirty-eight 
""
And I matriculated in nineteen forty 
""
And Karmveer Bhaurao sent me  to this great teacher in Sangli
""
""
When I  first told that our sir had got a first class in English
language and literature  I didn't understand the distinction between the
two 
""
Later on  and what
language is 
""
And being a teacher of English for  nearly twenty-three or
twenty-four years 
""
My  acquaintance with English is through Tarkhadkar translation
number one 
""
Perhaps you do not know who Tarkhadkar was 
""
Or why he bothered to write these three books of translation when
one was quite enough  ?
""
A  Kale's
""
""
""
""
So I matriculated as I said in nineteen forty so our  method
of 
roughly 
""
But having come into contact  your Principal said Prof Patil is
a living example I hope it is still living 
""
And as I was telling my old friend Suresh Pendase  in the bus in
the car that 
""
I received letters from my friends  Barrister P G Patil
""
""
Now the word is  they said
""
laughter 
""
And if by looking at me if he  has that idea I wouldn't quarrel
with him 
""
So  the horizon of literature was
open before us  its
enrollment was Dr Shastri  when I joined Sangli
 the
strength was three hundred and fifty 
""
All four classes of Arts  and two classes of upto inter-science
""
""
And the professors were about thirty-five
""
That means  per every professor ten students which is a good
good quota I see 
""
And as I said Dr Gokak came from Oxford  trailing clouds of
glory do we come from Heaven 
""
Now I am in my proper element uh not grammar but literature 
""
I had these two lines  are from
Wordsworth  Ode On Intimations Of Immortality From Recollections of
Early Childhood 
""
This is the mouth feeling type  Ode on Intimations of
immortality from recollections of early childhood 
""
And there Wordsworth 
samadhi 
""
When we are laid asleep in body and becoming living soul 
samadhi  because
you are very young men and you not bother about that just now 
laughter 
""
And there is a famous stanza which begins with  where these
lines occur  The
soul that rises with us  Hath had elsewhere
it setting and cometh from 
And not in utter nakedness  But trailing clouds of glory do we come from
God who is our Home  Shades of
the prison-house begin to close around the growing boy  And he sees it in
his joy  Into the light of
common day 
""
Now I have quoted about ten or twelve lines  which I heard from
""
""
When I was sitting on the very first bench  that was my only
distinction 
""
Sitting on the first bench  Mr president
our one of our teachers in Sangli was 
""
So I said sir  you are not being audible even on the first
bench  Dr Shastri
has allowed me 
""
So he said  you can't hear me ?
""
I said no sir 
laughter 
""
A man who thinks about this  he
has missed his way in the college 
""
So Dr Gokak this is how we see he used to
""
And Dr Gokak never stood on one spot 
""
He used to move from one end of the platform to the other
""
Those of you who have visited Sangli Willingdon college you know
that F Y Arts class 
""
And in those days Dr Shastri as you know  the professors had to
wear a dark gown 
""
Town and gown  a terminology from
the university of Oxford and Cambridge 
""
Town means people from the city 
students from the university 
""
Town and gown  so uh that is
""
""
And so Dr Gokak  as if we were little
children in the family 
""
He used to engage two periods in the F Y Arts classroom which 
which principal would engage F Y Arts students or P G students 
""
I understand these days principals don't bother to take any class
at all 
""
I hope you see this  time dishonour rule does not obtain in
this college 
""
Because basically  uh I was so happy to know that your
principal gets a salary of eight thousand 
laughter 
""
And when I started teaching in Sangli uh Satara under Karmveer
Bhaurao  my salary per month after B A London Bar at Law was seventy-five
basic and forty-five days allowance 
""
This is Arabian Nights stories 
""
 one
hundred 
""
This fellow should be sent to the Yeroda or mental home 
laughter 
""
And when uh 
vice-Chancellor's 
vice-Chancellor V C 
""
But the work was so difficult that rather then be V C I went to W C
""
""
And my salary at that time was two thousand 
and income tax and other tax cut 
rupees 
""
But money is neither here nor there
""
What what salary  ?
""
No salary because he was an honorary worker 
""
And hence boys and girls  a very senior persons so
you are all boys and girls for me 
""
I was taught this poem in the fourth standard the eighth standard
now fourth standard in my time 
Adam means 
""
Really it is  but this Lee Hunts did not
know 
""
So whether it is  same
thing 
""
 May his tribe
increase  May his tribe
increase 
""
Today our tribes are increasing by leaps and bounds  on the
family front 
""
So 
and  the way I am keeping
time keeping rhythm 
""
This is how our teacher used to teach us  Abu ben Adhem
may his tribe increase 
deep dream of peace 
""
Some of you 
""
Some of the dreams are black and white
""
Some  but that
is alright 
""
 from a deep
dream of peace  Making it
rich 
""
Lily 
""
 making it rich and like a lily in
bloom 
""
He saw in his dream an angel 
exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold 
""
Gold rhyming with bold 
""
 wri
""
""
Tarkhadkar translation today you don't know what thou is  ?
""
I write we write Thou writest he writes she writes they write 
""
Where is thou now  ?
""
T H O U thou 
""
Janabai  Yega
Yega Veethabai 
""
Uh I remember this not because I am Pandurang Patil 
""
You see 
 yega yega
veethabai 
""
We say this is unmannerly you should say  yaho yaho
Vithalrao kuthe gela hota magapasun 
""
So 
so that thou 
when you are addressing your parents or mother  and when you are
addressing  your beloved
""
Forget about the third thing but if you say God  laughter
""
""
Whenever  in our childhood
and whenever you see a thorn pricks  sole of
our 
""
Do we say  ?
""
Aai ga  yega yega
Veethabai 
""
So thou 
""
The angel was writing like this
""
 the names of
those whom love of Lord has blessed 
""
I don't know what your name is Mr so and so  I am writing down
the names in my book of gold  whom love of Lord had
blessed 
""
Now this is a list of successful people 
""
""
""
Is my name in the list of successful lottery winners  ?
""
""
""
Nay of course today you don't use nay 
""
We say N E I G H  laughter
""
""
A horse neighs  which is neigh
""
Nay N A Y means no nay 
""
When Abu knew that his name was not the poet has used the word 
in the next line 
""
 ?
""
Nahi ararara 
""
Abu spake 
""
""
""
If my name is not there in the list of people whom love of Lord
has blessed then write me as one who 
""
""
""
Generally Angels don't come back a second time 
""
 with a great wakening
light 
""
The light which woke up  with a great wakening light
""
""
 the names of those whom love of Lord has
blessed 
""
And  Lo L O
""
""
""
""
Means he stood first in the first class 
""
I have  a poem with fourteen lines
""
whether 
""
I was professor  and
beyond our college there is  another college started by Yashwantrao
 Yashawantrao Chavan
science college now 
""
And those colleges had  very majestic and imposing buildings
""
As your principal has said 
lakhs 
""
So I can't  not counted but I
can't see so much amount of money haven't seen so much amount of money 
""
And our Gadage Maharaj college was only a 
math  unimposing
building 
""
And the boys used to be matriculates from our high-school 
""
Because as the principal said  we run forty-four colleges and
three-hundred and seventy-eight high-schools 
""
Not even your director of education department run such an
enterprise 
""
So we asked the boys you see why is it that you see you are over
stepping us 
""
They said sir your Gadage Maharaj college is only a  math
""
laughter 
""
And that is true  Gadage
""
""
Those of you who come from rural areas know what a  gadage
""
""
These days nobody has seen a 
""
We have only seen 
""
He had this royal insignia  this earthenware pot was the royal
insignia of this great saint 
""
Ladies and gentleman when you were born very few of you have 
been born  because to be born in a nursing home you
have to give a previous notice to the doctor
""
In our case no notice was ever given 
""
Why we were born is a mystery 
""
How we were born is a still greater mystery  ?
""
And where we were born is a matter of conjecturing 
""
Because my father was a primary school teacher  and therefore
he has  the date of
my birth 
""
But some of you 
""
Gentlemen if you read 
Autobiography of Booker T Washington  Booker T Washing T means Telliferd
Booker Telliferd Washington  who died in nineteen
hundred and sixty 
""
Karmveer Bhaurao has been influenced by him also 
""
Booker T 
 translated
into Marathi as 
""
And the very first sentence of that autobiography is  I was
born somewhere 
""
Where I was born nobody knows  and when I was born nobody knows
""
""
So  on a makeshift
cot 
""
Not a modern cot 
""
And when our mother  have delivered us or must have delivered
us 
""
So our association 
gadaga 
""
And when we are about to breathe our last  may it be a far off
event you see when we are about to breathe our last  somebody has to
carry an earthen pot before the funeral procession
