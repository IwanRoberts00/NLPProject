Principal Madavee Shri Suresh
Pendse who has been put in a position of eminence in
a most unexpected manner Dr Shastri Prof Pradhan Shri
 Dhuri who is sitting just below me on the right hand side
 and Shri Tatyasaheb Patwardhan or Tatya Patwardhan
if not Tatyasaheb and members of the resource person team 
members of the staff of the English department of this college and 
fellow participants in this two day seminar on the method
or methods of teaching or trying to teach varieties of English 
to the twelfth standard boys and girls who happen to join our college
When Prof Uppar it may be pronounced as upper also you see
 laughter that also is there saw me in my residence at Bombay
 and showed me the letter of the principal
I said see I am most innocent into bracket ignorant of the
subject matter of your discussions or participations 
On my great teacher later on I'll have his I have something
to say about him uh Dr V K Gokak 
Uh it was said of him that he had a first in English we
don't say first class we say first means first class 
In English language and literature in the university of Oxford in
the year nineteen hundred and thirty-eight 
And I matriculated in nineteen forty 
And Karmveer Bhaurao sent me to this great teacher in Sangli
 and I was a little student with a Gandhi cap 
When I first told that our sir had got a first class in English
language and literature I didn't understand the distinction between the
two 
Later on I came to know what literature was and what
language is or is likely to be 
And being a teacher of English for nearly twenty-three or
twenty-four years I was never in charge of teaching grammar 
My acquaintance with English is through Tarkhadkar translation
number one number two number three 
Perhaps you do not know who Tarkhadkar was ? laughter 
Or why he bothered to write these three books of translation when
one was quite enough ?
A Kale's lesson in English translation Rao was Kale's
 younger brother Satara R R Kale 
 Kale's lessons in English translation 
So I matriculated as I said in nineteen forty so our method
of methodology of teaching English at Satara was to put it very 
roughly very crude 
But having come into contact your Principal said Prof Patil is
a living example I hope it is still living laughter 
And as I was telling my old friend Suresh Pendase in the bus in
the car that he was so kind enough to place at our disposal 
I received letters from my friends Barrister P G Patil
 Ajeev Sevak Rayat Shikshan Sanstha Satara 
Now the word is aajeev sevak they said
 ajeev sevak ajeev means nirjeev 
laughter 
And if by looking at me if he has that idea I wouldn't quarrel
with him laughter 
So this literature the horizon of literature was
open before us in that small college with a population of a its
enrollment was Dr Shastri I myself don't believe when I joined Sangli
 Willingdon college Sangli Gokaksaheb who had come from Oxford the
strength was three hundred and fifty 
All four classes of Arts and two classes of upto inter-science
 six classes three hundred and fifty 
And the professors were about thirty-five
That means per every professor ten students which is a good
good quota I see 
And as I said Dr Gokak came from Oxford trailing clouds of
glory do we come from Heaven from God who is our home 
Now I am in my proper element uh not grammar but literature 
I had these two lines young men and women are from
Wordsworth Ode On Intimations Of Immortality From Recollections of
Early Childhood 
This is the mouth feeling type Ode on Intimations of
immortality from recollections of early childhood 
And there Wordsworth is developing the thesis of 
samadhi 
When we are laid asleep in body and becoming living soul 
samadhi uh don't think about samadhi because
you are very young men and you not bother about that just now 
laughter 
And there is a famous stanza which begins with where these
lines occur Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting The
soul that rises with us our life's Star Hath had elsewhere
it setting and cometh from from afar Not in entire forgetfulness 
And not in utter nakedness But trailing clouds of glory do we come from
God who is our Home Heaven lies about us in our infancy Shades of
the prison-house begin to close around the growing boy And he sees it in
his joy Until at last the vision fades far away Into the light of
common day 
Now I have quoted about ten or twelve lines which I heard from
 the lips of my great teacher 
When I was sitting on the very first bench that was my only
distinction 
Sitting on the first bench because sometimes Mr president
our one of our teachers in Sangli was not speaking loudly enough 
So I said sir you are not being audible even on the first
bench whereas our teacher said and the principal the Dr Shastri
has allowed me the free use of Marathi language occasionally 
So he said you can't hear me ?
I said no sir I can't hear in Marathi 
laughter in Marathi 
A man who thinks about this filling things etcetera he
has missed his way in the college 
So Dr Gokak this is how we see he used to
And Dr Gokak never stood on one spot on the platform 
He used to move from one end of the platform to the other
Those of you who have visited Sangli Willingdon college you know
that F Y Arts class 
And in those days Dr Shastri as you know the professors had to
wear a dark gown 
Town and gown town and gown this is a a terminology from
the university of Oxford and Cambridge 
Town means people from the city and gown means people 
students from the university 
Town and gown that has become very brown now so uh that is
 laughter 
And so Dr Gokak used to play with us as if we were little
children in the family 
He used to engage two periods in the F Y Arts classroom which 
which principal would engage F Y Arts students or P G students 
I understand these days principals don't bother to take any class
at all laughter 
I hope you see this time dishonour rule does not obtain in
this college laughter 
Because basically uh I was so happy to know that your
principal gets a salary of eight thousand rupees 
laughter eight thousand 
And when I started teaching in Sangli uh Satara under Karmveer
Bhaurao my salary per month after B A London Bar at Law was seventy-five
basic and forty-five days allowance laughter 
This is Arabian Nights stories laughter 
 B A Bar at Law B A London Bar at Law salary one
hundred one hundred and twenty rupees 
This fellow should be sent to the Yeroda or mental home 
laughter 
And when uh Dr Shastri was saying uh sir what about 
vice-Chancellor's pay I was getting two thousand rupees as V C 
vice-Chancellor V C 
But the work was so difficult that rather then be V C I went to W C
 laughter 
And my salary at that time was two thousand rupees 
and income tax and other tax cut I use to get fourteen hundred 
rupees per month 
But money is neither here nor there
What what salary did Karmveer Bhaurao get ?
No salary because he was an honorary worker 
And hence boys and girls I am a a very senior persons so
you are all boys and girls for me laughter 
I was taught this poem in the fourth standard the eighth standard
now fourth standard in my time Abu Ben Adham 
Adam means Aadam 
Really it is Aadam but this Lee Hunts did not
know Aadam 
So whether it is Aadam or Adam or Adham same
thing 
 Abu ben Adhem A D H E M May his tribe
increase this is a famous phrase in English May his tribe
increase 
Today our tribes are increasing by leaps and bounds on the
family front laughter 
So Abu ben Adhem may his tribe increase 
and I'm quoting this poem please remember the way I am keeping
time keeping rhythm 
This is how our teacher used to teach us Abu ben Adhem
may his tribe increase Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace 
deep dream of peace 
Some of you uh gentlemen have dreams 
Some of the dreams are black and white
Some some professors get into technicolour dreams but that
is alright laughter 
 Awoke from from from one night amo from a deep
dream of peace And saw within the moonlight in his room Making it
rich and like a lily in bloom 
Lily not name of a girl Lily or Leela 
 Like a lily in bloom making it rich and like a lily in
bloom 
He saw in his dream an angel writing in a book of gold 
exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold 
Gold rhyming with bold 
 Exceeding peace had made Ben Adehm bold And he wri
 he asked him what writest thou 
Tarkhadkar translation today you don't know what thou is ?
I write we write Thou writest he writes she writes they write 
Where is thou now ?
T H O U thou that is now planted and supplanted also 
Janabai that famous Saint of Maharashtra says Yega
Yega Veethabai Maze Pandhariche Aai 
Uh I remember this not because I am Pandurang Patil 
You see yega yega veethabai maze pandariche aai 
 Vitthal is suppose to be a mother and so yega yega
veethabai 
We say this is unmannerly you should say yaho yaho
Vithalrao kuthe gela hota magapasun laughter 
So yega yega veethabai maze pandhariche aai 
so that thou thou pronoun is to be used when you are addressing God 
when you are addressing your parents or mother and when you are
addressing your beloved
Forget about the third thing but if you say God laughter
 and our mother 
Whenever most of us go barefooted in our childhood
and whenever you see a thorn pricks into our sole S O L E sole of
our so we say aai ga 
Do we say baba ho ?
Aai ga that is the significance of yega yega
Veethabai 
So thou What writest thou 
The angel was writing like this
 The vision raised its head and said the names of
those whom love of Lord has blessed 
I don't know what your name is Mr so and so I am writing down
the names in my book of gold the names of those whom love of Lord had
blessed 
Now this is a list of successful people 
 So Abu ben says is mine one 
Is my name in the list of successful lottery winners ?
 Is mine one Nay not so 
Nay of course today you don't use nay 
We say N E I G H that's different neigh laughter
A horse neighs and the lion roars which is neigh
Nay N A Y means no nay not so your name is not there 
When Abu knew that his name was not the poet has used the word 
in the next line Abu spake more low 
 Nav hai ka ?
Nahi ararara 
Abu spake spoke more low 
 Then write me as one who loves his fellowmen 
If my name is not there in the list of people whom love of Lord
has blessed then write me as one who who loves his fellowmen 
 The angel wrote and vanished 
Generally Angels don't come back a second time 
 The next night it came again with a great wakening
light 
The light which woke up Abu with a great wakening light
 And showed the names of those whom love of Lord has
blessed 
And la last line Lo L O
 means beholds 
 Lo Ben Adhems name led all the rest 
Means he stood first in the first class 
I have recited this sonnet a poem with fourteen lines
 because this is the description of all benifactors of mankind 
whether they are people like Sadguru Gadage Maharaj 
I was professor at Sadguru Gadage Maharaj Karad and
beyond our college there is a another college started by Yashwantrao
 Chavan's institute Science college Yashawantrao Chavan
science college now Venutai Cha Arts college now 
And those colleges had very majestic and imposing buildings
As your principal has said six buildings worth sixteen 
lakhs of rupees 
So I can't I have not not only cou not counted but I
can't see so much amount of money haven't seen so much amount of money 
And our Gadage Maharaj college was only a a monastery 
math of Sadguru Gadage Maharaj a small building unimposing
building and me and Mrs Patil working there 
And the boys used to be matriculates from our high-school 
Because as the principal said we run forty-four colleges and
three-hundred and seventy-eight high-schools 
Not even your director of education department run such an
enterprise 
So we asked the boys you see why is it that you see you are over
stepping us and going to that college 
They said sir your Gadage Maharaj college is only a math
 Gadage Maharaja's math 
laughter 
And that is true this person Gadage Maharaj Gadage
Those of you who come from rural areas know what a gadage
 is ? laughter 
These days nobody has seen a gadage 
We have only seen 
He had this royal insignia this earthenware pot was the royal
insignia of this great saint gadage 
Ladies and gentleman when you were born very few of you have 
been born in a nursing home because to be born in a nursing home you
have to give a previous notice to the doctor
In our case no notice was ever given laughter 
Why we were born is a mystery ? laughter 
How we were born is a still greater mystery ?
And where we were born is a matter of conjecturing 
Because my father was a primary school teacher and therefore
he has written out written down noted the date of
my birth 
But some of you not know your dates of birth 
Gentlemen if you read a famous book in English 
Autobiography of Booker T Washington Booker T Washing T means Telliferd
Booker Telliferd Washington the negro educator who died in nineteen
hundred and sixty 
Karmveer Bhaurao has been influenced by him also 
Booker T Washington's autobiograpy is named as 
 Up from Slavery Up from Slavery translated
into Marathi as Atmaudhar 
And the very first sentence of that autobiography is I was
born somewhere and some when 
Where I was born nobody knows and when I was born nobody knows
So this we were born in a dingy room on a makeshift
cot 
Not a modern cot but a makeshift cot 
And when our mother have delivered us or must have delivered
us we were heated by the coals put in an earthern ware pot 
So our association with this earthenware pot 
gadaga is from our birth 
And when we are about to breathe our last may it be a far off
event you see when we are about to breathe our last somebody has to
carry an earthen pot before the funeral procession
