<I>
Now we have to pull each others' leg 
Yeah you pull my right leg then I will pull your left leg 
 okay or you will do the other way 
 Okay 
No problem 
Just let it go
Okay hey man let it go laughter 
Hey not bad what is it 
Where it will go 
Let it go where it goes
Anywhere uh
Anywhere because we are now in whose who so that 
tell me something more about that how you happened to go inside 
Well it was a shock for me
 Haan haan 
Uhm actually I was not expecting anything 
One fine day one letter came 
You know Joshi this our uh this man yaar 
 Diwakar's husband 
Diwakar 
He was in B E L no 
Oh our Joshi okay I I got got him
Okay you got him
 Haan 
 one word Joshi 
He was that uh there at my house that day 
I suddenly got that letter from one editor
 Haan haan 
And he told we have selected you for publishing uh
 who's who in Asia and some so called 
 But how how come he got your address then 
Then I started looking at it
It looked as if it had come through the alumini association of
I A S C
Uhm uhm 
Because it was uh styled in the same way that is he passed
 B E in so and so year from this college and M E also in this college and
Uhm uhm
Working in so and so Company 
So his name also got included into that
No he is not from I A S C 
Then I checked up with two or three my friends who were in I A
S C
 Haan 
Their names also had appeared 
So this was actually whatever uh thought you you were
proud of yourself that your name is in who's who but you don't
feel all those bugger's names also laughter not included in
that
Not so but it the initially pressure was very high
But now it is not so
Whether it's it's not that uh something is
of great achievement
Many people who have done who had excelled in education also
there who had not excelled in education but some other field also are there
I see 
Like that it is 
It is some achievement who has done 
Man of achievement in Asia or something like that they are probably
No that's what I was surprised because laughter
 I don't know what actually you had done 
Well really you have to enlighten me on that 
That uh okay you have spoken for me also laughter 
Uh well uhm how have you told this thing to your boss then
He don't know it's not worth because the
bosses and other people in the factory
Uhm
They really are hell bent upon pulling you down 
 Accha 
In the sense now well I have been for one word
 because to avoid those fellas but uh they are saying that we
will not complete uhm myself and two words simply
getting troubled
 Uhm 
Why why why they are not allowing you to give enough you
are not allowed to do
No
Studies or things like that or collect some data 
No the thing is atleast upto this January I need free time to
study and uh prepare for my comprehensive exam
Uhm uhm 
And these buggers wants their own personal jobs to be done 
which are most silliest in nature 
And after getting some twenty years of experience uhm
 you really feel that technical knowledge is instead of increasing
getting reducing
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm 
You cannot go on enlightening them on technical things simply
because you will be getting in trouble 
I see 
Now if you enlighten them they will come to know and
tomorrow they will pull your leg
Okay 
But I didn't get personal jobs means which kind of jobs 
Uh well some small things something to be done like
 uh one small simple problem will be given to my immediate work
Uhm uhm 
 It's supposed to be done by that fellow
Uhm uhm 
He simply doesn't want to do it but want to show that he has
done it 
Uhm uhm
So he will transfer it to me
Uhm 
Whereas there is some other related job to my PhD work my
research work like some vibrations and other things
If I want to go and attend it he says why you have to go 
Let the requisition come from the department let the people call
you with a uh kumkum tilaka and haldi kunku
 and akshata then only you go how can I
go 
 Okay like that you have got now enough uh
marathi words for saying this
Yes laughter 
Okay uhm no but uh 
 Uhm 
No it's happening recently very late uhm 
within this in one month
He only has suggested your name name for this
No chance uhm no chance that fellow he
won't do cannot suggest anything
 Uhn 
Okay 
Now he himself feel that he should have got the chance to go
for PhD or something like that something no no nothing
like that
 No no 
He cannot go 
 You know that 
You know pucca sure that he cannot uh 
Yeah he cannot go
Yes okay so
Now tell me something about yourself your achievement and
 so on and so forth 
Look it is the same thing as you 
Uh only difference is that uh I've I've not
also achieved anything 
But uh lack of achievement uh uh doesn't mean that now
 I'll who's who I'm still not there
Maybe I'm trying to underachieve something may be 
laughter hoping that some day my day also will come in a way
Sure
Right now the it's something uh doing lot
of hard work and like that some project missions are there and uh 
 with international company then see what what has happened 
Working hard
 I don't know 
Specially today this software companies are having lot of
 work actually
Yeah 
Recently I
You see they are growing growing too fast that is that is
idea so uh basically you are always under staff yeah 
when you are working 
And uh responsibilities are more and the things are going too
fast so I think one of the major problem in software world over is
that uh we one word basically we always underestimate the
work 
That is the problem known all over the world
Always we underestimate our work by some three hundred percent
 laughter okay so that is that is our true problem
 Yeah 
 Okay 
And what about this uh what is called as uh sending
programmers to USA as a cheap labourer
Body surfing
Yeah body surfing I've read that in computer
magazine
 Haan haan 
September issue they have send it 
That uh simply one fellow with a phone will hire some guys 
 exactly and send there for one year
 Exactly 
Yeah 
He will earn lot of money
 That's true
There are some three hundred four hundred person margins in that
Uhn
They tell you which uh this thing but the person who is
going there that is also happy because normally once he goes he just
quits that company and joins another company there
But that uh H H one visa or something has
change no
B one visa is change to H one visa something
 What has happen 
Yeah but still still uh what has happened actually it is
not exactly the cheap labour I will say that is also one portion like 
uh cheap labour but the one another uh major aspect is that like think
about a situation like uh would you like to go today as a well
qualified person and go and work in Shimoga or some place called
Shirshi would you like to work like that
They will not serve
You won't like 
You like to work in indutrial base like Bombay Pune 
Bangalore Delhi
No no not definitely with the Bombay Calcutta
Okay prefer anywhere uh place in let's say 
 Bangalore Pune think like that place you won't like to go a
small place
 Bangalore or Pune 
That is what exactly happens most of the jobs some of
the jobs are in villages in US and people there don't want to go
there 
Okay but a person going from US uh going from India to USA he
feels that okay America 
America 
So he is ready to live anywhere
And and another thing one dollar equal to thirty-five
 rupees 
Yeah that is one of the thing
So that is basically things which keeps you it's so
and there also when you are in the small place there of saving
potential is more and something
But one one thing I
Everybody is happy that that is the idea basically 
The person who goes there will be happy 
The person who sent him will be happy
The company who has hired him happy 
So everybody is so far so far it has been very well situatiion
So it is a goody goody happy happy situation
Yeah may be it may not be there after two three years when he
was there then he feels that there are no chances of growth he cannot go
to big companies
Maybe when he realise when he has enough money then he will
realise that that there are no much chance of growth later on 
Then then he'll try to
No but the thing is they want they they they try to move
to better but they never come back to India 
No some people are there some people have come
back I know lot of people in our country uh in my company actually have
come back 
 Because that is 
Uh ha which company 
So total eight minutes are over we need to continue 
na 
Uhm
We need to continue na 
Yeah we must continue other ten minutes laughter 
This exercise we have to be pulled on cough 
Today what happened no uhm actually in the
morning uh we didn't get our paper
 Uhm 
Uhm
So
You bought it uh
No no we ourself enquired why I couldn't get the paper
So I went to that paperwalah uh 
and that I ask I asked him what has happened
What has happened since today next three days that
paper-boy who drops the paper na he's on vacation
 on leave uh and his manager or his uh that boss
or whoever is the owner he doesn't know my house 
So he knew that uh he can drop the paper but he don't know
where to contact me or anything
So I went there and now then he said okay do you want todays
paper so he gave me
 Uh 
 Uh 
So that means you got up in the morning and went there as you
said 
No laughter yeah yeah yeah 
So just now it's ten O'clock at nine and we just
now got up
I see 
We came came to you for breakfast 
Breakfast okay 
But unfortunately we have finished our dinner 
So there is a jet leg between two of us laughter 
By the way that I talked told you about Mahen Satkarsh you
remember
Yeah what has happened to him 
Uh he one of his friend it seems had some vacancy for
temporarily in the sense he said he can manage for few days and stay
with him haan till he gets the place
there 
What has one word happened is
 Haan 
He has talked to one of uh persons from my company or no
Uh I don't know I passed on the message
Okay
What happened was his company used to start at eight
thirty in the morning
Uhm uhm 
He was under the impression it starts at nine
 Haan 
So one day he was going through the one word 
casually and he saw the office time is at eight thirty to six or so
Uhm 
So he has to start approximately two hours early 
Oh
From here to majestic majestic to that golden
enclove
He has to start at six six thirty
Uhn and that was not possible then what he decided
was to stay with some friends there
Uhm 
And again that the body shopping is there 
He has been told not to go in for a big house not to go in for
a
Yeah I know lot people are going any way
Vehicle and passport and all those 
Ha
So he has to be on a temporary basis for sometime 
Then go there work for one year uhm find out
some job
But I I doubt whether the visa will be given properly or
not 
 Uhm 
What happens if the man going there and some working in
some TATA TISL or something
Uhm
