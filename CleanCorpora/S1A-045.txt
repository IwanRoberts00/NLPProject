<I>
""
""
Now 
""
""
Yeah you pull my right leg then I will pull your left leg 
""
""
""
""
""
""
No problem 
""
""
Just let it go
""
""
Okay 
""
""
Hey not bad what is it 
""
Where it will go 
""
""
Let it go where it goes
""
""
Anywhere uh
""
""
Anywhere because we are now 
tell me something more about that how 
""
""
Well  it was a shock for me
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm actually I was not expecting anything 
""
One fine day one letter came 
""
You know Joshi 
""
""
""
Diwakar 
""
""
He was in B E L no 
""
""
Oh our Joshi okay I I got  got him
""
""
Okay you got him
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He was that uh 
""
I suddenly got that letter from one  editor
""
""
""
""
""
And he told  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then I started looking at it
""
It looked as if it had come through the  alumini association of
I A S C
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Because it was uh  styled in the same way that is he passed
 B E in so and so year from this college and M E also in this college and
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Working in so and so Company 
""
""
So his name also  got included into that
""
""
No he is not from I A S C 
""
Then I checked up with two or three my friends who were in  I A
S C
""
""
""
""
""
Their names also had appeared 
""
""
So this was actually whatever uh  thought you you were
proud of yourself that your name is in  but you don't
feel all those  not included in
that
""
""
Not so but  initially pressure was very high
""
But now it is not so
""
Whether  something is
of great achievement
""
Many people who have done  who had excelled in education also
there who had not excelled in education but some other field also are there
""
""
""
I see 
""
""
Like that it is 
""
It is some achievement who has done 
""
Man of achievement in Asia or something like that they are probably
""
""
""
No  laughter
""
""
Well 
""
""
That uh okay you have spoken for me also 
""
""
Uh well uhm how  have you told this thing to your boss then
""
""
He don't know  the
bosses and other people in the factory
""
""
Uhm
""
""
They 
""
""
""
""
""
In the sense  one word
 they are saying that we
will not complete  simply
getting troubled
""
""
""
""
""
Why why why they are not allowing you to  give enough you
are not allowed to do
""
""
No
""
""
Studies or things like that or 
""
""
No the thing is atleast upto this January I need free time to
study and  uh prepare for my comprehensive exam
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And these buggers wants their own personal jobs to be done 
which are most silliest in nature 
""
And after getting some twenty years of experience  uhm
 that technical knowledge is instead of increasing
getting  reducing
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
You cannot go on enlightening them on technical things simply
because 
""
""
I see 
""
""
Now if you enlighten them  and
tomorrow they will pull your leg
""
""
Okay 
""
But I didn't get personal jobs means which kind of jobs 
""
""
Uh well some  something to be done like
 uh one small simple problem will be given to my immediate work
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
 supposed to be done by that fellow
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
He simply doesn't want to do it but want to show that he has
done it 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
So he will transfer it to me
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Whereas there is some other related job to my PhD work my
research work like some vibrations and other things
""
If I want to go and attend it 
""
Let the requisition come from the department let the people call
you with a  haldi kunku
 how can I
go 
""
""
 uh
marathi words for saying this
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Okay 
""
""
""
""
""
No 
within this in one month
""
""
He only has suggested your name  name for this
""
""
No chance  that fellow he
won't do  cannot suggest anything
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
Now  he himself feel that he should have got the chance to go
for PhD or  nothing
like that
""
""
""
""
""
He 
""
""
""
""
""
You know 
""
""
Yeah  he cannot go
""
""
Yes  so
""
""
Now tell me something about  yourself your achievement and
""
""
""
Look 
""
Uh only difference is that  not
also achieved anything 
""
But uh  uh doesn't mean that now
 still not there
""
Maybe 
laughter  hoping that some day my day also will come in a way
""
""
Sure
""
""
Right now the  doing lot
of hard work and like that some project missions are there 
""
""
Working hard
""
""
""
""
""
Specially today this software companies are  having lot of
 work actually
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Recently I
""
""
You see they are growing growing too fast  that is that is
idea so 
when you are working 
""
And  uh responsibilities are more and the things are going too
fast so I think  major problem in software world over is
that uh  basically we always underestimate the
work 
""
That is the problem known all over the world
""
Always we underestimate our work by  some three hundred percent
 so that is that is our true problem
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And what about this uh  what is called as uh sending
programmers to USA as a cheap labourer
""
""
Body surfing
""
""
Yeah body surfing  read that in computer
magazine
""
""
""
""
""
September issue 
""
That uh 
 and send there for one year
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
He will earn lot of money
""
""
 true
""
There are some three hundred four hundred person margins in that
""
""
Uhn
""
""
They tell you which uh  this thing but the person who is
going there that is also happy because  he just
quits that company and joins another company there
""
""
But that uh  visa or something has
change no
""
B one visa is change to H one visa something
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah but still still  uh what has happened actually it is
not exactly the 
uh cheap labour but the one another uh major aspect is that  like think
about a situation like uh  as a well
qualified person  or some place called
Shirshi  would you like to work like that
""
""
They will not serve
""
""
You won't like 
""
You like to work in indutrial base like Bombay 
Bangalore  Delhi
""
""
No no  not definitely with the Bombay Calcutta
""
""
Okay prefer anywhere uh place in 
 think like that place you won't like to go a
small place
""
""
""
""
""
That is what exactly happens  some of
the jobs are in villages in US  people there don't want to go
there 
""
Okay but a person going from US  uh going from India to USA he
feels that okay America 
""
""
America 
""
""
So he is ready to live anywhere
""
""
And and another thing  one dollar equal to thirty-five
""
""
""
Yeah that is one of the thing
""
So  so
and there also  there of saving
potential is more and something
""
""
But one  one thing I
""
""
Everybody is happy that that is the idea basically 
""
The person who goes there will be happy 
""
The person who sent him will be happy
""
The company who has hired him happy 
""
So everybody is  so far so far it has been very well situatiion
""
""
So it is a goody goody happy happy situation
""
""
Yeah may be it may not be there after two three years when he
was there  then he feels that there are no chances of growth he cannot go
to big companies
""
Maybe when he realise  when he has enough money then he will
realise that that there are no much chance of growth later on 
""
Then then  try to
""
""
No but the thing is they want they they  they try to move
to better but they never come back to India 
""
""
No some  there some people have come
back I know  lot of people in our country uh in my company actually have
come back 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh ha which company 
""
""
So total eight minutes are over we need to continue 
na 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
We need to continue 
""
""
Yeah 
""

""
""
Today what happened no  actually in the
morning  uh we didn't get our paper
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So
""
""
You bought it uh
""
""

""
So I went to that 
and that I ask  what has happened
""
What has happened  next three days that
paper-boy who drops the paper  on vacation
 that boss
or whoever is 
""
So he knew that uh  he can drop the paper but he don't know
where to contact me or anything
""
So I went there and now  then he said okay do you want todays
paper so he gave me
