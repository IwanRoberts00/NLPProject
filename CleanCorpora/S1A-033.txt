<I>
When did you go to the U UK 
So uh what are you to say about your Marxism and things like
that 
Marxism is supposed to one word 
Uhm 
When did you first start reading on Marxism actually 
Well I didn't read at all 
I think it was from my locality that I I got
the idea
Uhm because you happened to be with Marxist you thought it
is a very good ideology 
Well I didn't know anything about ideology aspects 
in the beginning uhm 
In my place I mean in our locality there were
people who were not who called some some Marxists uhm
And they had a peculiar way uhm which attracted
me
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 What are that what are that 
peculiar way 
Well you know the so called co-operation uhm
 the way they see with the way they treat people uhm
 the way they talk the way they behave 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
So this this attracted you 
You struct your something yeah uh which
which the other ideologists didn't had 
 Yeah 
Yes 
Uhm is that 
 That's what I think 
Which means that uh if you were brought up in a different
 en environment say for example among the Christians or among 
among the Muslims or among among the Jains and Buddhists say you
would have accepted that ideology
No no no because you know uh I was among the
Christians I was among the Hindus uhm but neither
Christianity nor Hinduism affected me uhm 
Only this particular way of living as we call
 it is the Marxist way way of living it
only attracted me 
Because it had something speciality uhm uhm 
Something this something that uhm that 
that makes it uh distinct from Hinduism or Christianity
I do not like Hinduism and I do not like Christianity 
But I like Marxism because it makes a man think about people
It makes a man think about his own fellow men and also about
his place in the world 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
Well what has Marx to say about the things which happened 
before eighteen what is it seventeen eighty wh when was Marx
born seventeen eighty eighty-three eighty-five
No no Marx was born in the 
Well I think
Nineteenth century but Marxism Marxism
began with Marxism began with property 
Marxism lived through uh no no plight okay
 uhm 
It was a democrator and then that this was followed by 
a generation of thinkers and finally uh it came to Hegel 
Hegel had his views 
And then Marx Marx had his own views and he developed into
 an ideology 
The form that we have now
 Uh no no 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 One word uh that's fine 
Well how does a marxism help you in your class uh in
your teaching whether it it help you 
Will it help you to teach Shakespeare or uh language 
 Does it help you 
 Well we can look at Shakespeare from uh a Marxist
angle for example in Hamlet we can we can
 uh take the case of Hamlet 
 Hamlet sees the fall of his mother
 uhm not of the fault of that particular individual 
 uhm but as the defect of the world in general 
This is the Bourgeois approach to human experience 
An individual experience cannot be the experience of 
everybody in this world uhm 
So in that way one cannot according to Marxist thinkers
 one cannot universalise a on a particular experience
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm uhm so once you explain a text
like this uh
 So 
When we explain a text like Shakespeare uh a
Shakespearean play the interpretation will be in that way 
uhn
 One or two words 
Okay how does it help you in your teaching of language 
Well there is no answer
Uhm how does it help you in your family life 
Talking to your wife and children 
 Family life in family life it helps a lot
 uhm 
Because in Indian society uhm which
follows one a particular system uhm 
I mean a male dominated Indian society uhm
Uh it's rigid uhm 
And Marxism makes it flexible
We uh we are told to look at women in a way we should
look at a humanity
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 That's what even feminism says 
Feminism didn't say anything very different
Oh feminism may be imitating the Marxist 
Uhm uhm uhm 
So why did it fail in Russia 
Why 
Why did it fail in Russia 
Why did it fail in Russia 
See it was the fault was not with Marxism 
It wasn't with it was not with Marx
It was with the people who were in Power 
 There They were corrupt 
 If it is applicable to Marxism is not
applicable to any other ism then 
Well I'm not aware of any other ism at present
Why Marxism failed in Russia is an open question 
People have been discussing for a long time 
And people
Once you say that there is something wrong
with the people 
And nothing wrong with an ideology 
 Know 
There wasn't anything wrong with the Russian the
ideology that Russians had 
Well the people in power were wrong
They went wrong 
And they and their system two word 
And the foreign intervention intervention from the part of
 American and all other capitalist nations were also there 
They were trying for a long time to destroy the Soviet Union
since its inception in uh in nineteen seventeen 
They have been trying for a long time to destroy the set- up
Well Stalin with his iron hands could uh prevent the
Soviet set-up from destruction 
But the later rulers couldn't 
 If any other ideology one or two words 
Uhm one word it's okay uhm
Can a thing be prevented with iron hands 
Yes many things could be prevented with iron hands
Means they are prevented
For example that was what that was what Stalin Stalin
did in Russia uhn
 But if they are prevented with iron hands what 
Or if something is prevented with iron hands 
uhn it means uhn the person who prevents 
uhn is likely to be again uhn destroyed by iron hands
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
Suppose someone is going to destroy your society and
suppose there is strong person with a very strong force to protect
the society well he is doing a good job 
He is saving the society 
So that was exactly what Stalin did in Russia 
 But those who oppose
You know the
But those who oppose if you destroy them uhn 
then it means that you are doing a something good for the society 
 Uhn 
Yes if the society has a cancer of hand it has to be cut
Who is going to decide 
It is the people 
If it is the people then other people had any voice
Well
If is a person goes on destroying everyone
Communism cannot succeed without the support of the people
That was what happened in Kerala
For example Marxsism failed in Kerala and West Bengal 
Why did it fail in Kerala and West Bengal 
Because it wasn't a popular movement 
So communism failed not communism Marxism fail in
Kerala in West Bengal also the movement failed 
It was because the those people who who were the 
opponents of that particular movement uh could not influence people 
Okay fine
Means uh if if it failed in Russia uhm it
means people are not with Communism 
 Uhm 
People are still with communism in Russia 
You know the way they uh the way they executed communism
 I mean the how they practised communism that was wrong 
In what sense it is one word 
What sense it is
What what those who are in power uhn 
then they have something like politbureau yeah and the
members of the politbureau ahn infact again become
previleged people
 Uhn 
 Yeah 
 Ahn 
Ah yeah that was there 
 And if they become previleged people 
 corruption you'll find ball is in their hand
 Corruption 
Yeah that is that is corruption 
It means any ism for that matter ultimately leads to
hurt
See there is nothing called ultimate 
Because you know these people went wrong 
Who went wrong 
 E E this people those people who were at
the helm of affairs 
 Those who were the as you pointed out 
 ah supporters of communism 
 Ah 
Not supporters of communism
The people who were in power for example in Russia 
there was Gorbochov 
 But who comes in power 
Now actually these people
 He he accepted the prize who got the Nobel
Prize
 No no 
Uhm
Why did he accept the Nobel Prize 
What was Bernard Shaw's reaction when he was awarded
the Nobel Prize 
Bernard Shaw was not a pure communist but this man Gorbochov
 secretary of the C P S U accepted the noble prize 
And who are noble uhm the inventor of uh
weapon intended to destroy humanity 
Marxism stands for humanity 
It is for the preservation of humanity 
And this man Gorbochov accepted a medal meant for the
 capitalist profit motivated people 
So in that way he was going 
 Uhm 
 Any person who comes into power he comes
because of popular support 
But once he comes into power he becomes power crazy power
greedy
He is after more and more power and ultimately what happens he
finds everything is centred in him and because of that uh again 
he goes at basic principles of one word 
See this was not what happened in the Soviet Union 
You may know about uh that Perestroika and Glasnot
 See see and there but there also again what
happens we find that members of the politbureau they were previleged
people there ah 
But with if Marx was under 
 Ah 
 That was not so in the past
And the society in which there are one word he
wants to have a classless society 
And that dream he had 
Well uh I do not agree 
Okay fine I think we talk about something else uhm
uhm
How did you enjoy your stay here 
I enjoyed your company very much 
Why 
Because you know it is a very different sort of experience
Because in our state it is uh raining uhm
 and it is very unpleasant uhm 
We can not sit like this and chat because of the uh tanned
 atmosphere and uh chill uhm 
So you know in that way and uh again it's a
change uhn uhn from the what we have been doing there 
Now I'm in a different atmosphere uh both physically
and mentally 
And so uh uh I feel that I can enjoy it 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Yeah how did you enjoy your stay here 
Very fine to be here in company of 
Fine ka matlab 
Well
How fine 
Because all the while I was in the company of very nice
people uhm educated again refined those who have
very nice ideas to propogate hm hm hm and
 Uhm 
 Hm hm hm 
Well in that way you too have an idea to propogate 
You propogate Hinduism and he propogates uh Islam
 Islam 
 Islam 
Uh yes uh you have recently been to your 
yeah family yeah what about your children wife 
how are they
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
In fact uh my son and daughter they had asked me to
buy buy them uhm this thing the sunglasses
Have they missed you a lot 
Yeah they did miss me in fact they were waiting for their
sunglasses
As soon as I went home my son asked me uh asked me for the
sunglasses 
Luckily I bought bought two bought two 
For the one the one I bought for my son was very loose 
So he always wearing it and slipped on his nose and he was 
uh he asked me one or two words putting in back 
Then when my daughter it fitted very well 
So luckily I I could I could bring I can buy them
If not I would have had a tough time 
Then then my daughter wanted some jewels something like that
She she cried she wanted jewel somethings like that 
Then I promised to buy some silk sarees for for
my wife from Mysore
Then she she wasn't very keen
She said okay fine
I think I get good one to buy 
Then my wife's sister also wanted a saree
Then two of her sisters also wanted sarees so I
 now I have to buy about four six sarees from here 
These are going to come about four thousand rupees
 I think I'll have to spent 
So yes I one or two words you don't worry yes I can
get get the whole thing for about three thousand five hundred even that 
I'll find 
So I'm just thinking what I should do
What 
But then of course I have a hell of time travelling uh I
mean from here to Erode and Erode to Trinavelli and Trinavelli to uh
once again to Ooty 
No this is in Mysore stays and here and back
Rather bit too much 
For for first time I've been experiencing so much of
trouble travelling
Now after month of travelling sitting in a bus and for two
nights continously a bit too much 
But then I really think whether whether I should have been taking
so much of trouble 
This one month uh I mean my I mean my OD OD not not I
mean not being sanctioned till now
