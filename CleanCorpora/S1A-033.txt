<I>
""
""
When did you go to the 
""
So  Marxism and things like
that 
""
""
Marxism 
""
""
Uhm 
""
When did you first start reading on Marxism actually 
""
""
Well 
""
I think  got
the idea
""
""
Uhm  because you happened to be with Marxist you thought it
is a very good ideology 
""
""
Well 
in the beginning 
""
In  there were
people  uhm
""
""
And they had a peculiar way  which attracted
me
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
peculiar way 
""
""
Well you know the so called  uhm
 uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this 
""
You  uh which
which the other ideologists didn't had 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uhm is that 
""
""
""
""
""
Which means that  uh if you were brought up in a different
""
among the Muslims or among  say you
would have accepted that ideology
""
""
No no no  uh I was among the
Christians  but neither
Christianity nor Hinduism affected me 
""
Only this  as we call
 it
only attracted me 
""
Because it had something speciality 
""
Something this 
that  Hinduism or Christianity
""
""
I do not like Hinduism 
""
But I like Marxism  because it makes a man think about people
""
""
It makes a man think about his own fellow men  and also about
his place in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well what has Marx to say about the things which happened 
before eighteen what is it  when was Marx
born  eighty-three eighty-five
""
""
No no 
""
""
Well I think
""
""
Nineteenth century  Marxism
began with 
""
Marxism lived  plight okay
""
""
It was a democrator 
a generation of 
""
Hegel had his views 
""
And then Marx  and he developed into
""
""
The form that we  have now
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well how does  uh in
your teaching 
""
Will it help you to teach Shakespeare 
""
""
""
""
 uh a Marxist
angle  we can we can
""
""
 of his mother
""
""
""
This is the Bourgeois approach 
""
An individual experience 
everybody in this world 
""
So in that way  according to Marxist thinkers
 a particular experience
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  once you explain a text
like this uh
""
""
""
""
""
When we explain a text like  uh a
Shakespearean play 
uhn
""
""
""
""
""
Okay how does it help you in your teaching of language 
""
""
Well  there is no answer
""
""
Uhm 
""
Talking to your wife 
""
""
 in family life it helps a lot
""
""
Because  which
follows 
""
I mean  uhm
""
""
Uh 
""
And Marxism  flexible
""
We  in a way we should
look at  humanity
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Feminism didn't say anything very different
""
""
Oh feminism may be imitating the Marxist 
""
""
Uhm uhm uhm 
""
""
So why did it fail in Russia 
""
""
Why 
""
""
Why did it fail in Russia 
""
""
Why did it fail in Russia 
""
See 
""
It wasn't with  Marx
""
It was 
""
""
""
""
 is not
applicable to any other ism then 
""
""
Well  at present
""
""
Why Marxism failed in Russia 
""
People have been discussing 
""
And people
""
""
Once you  there is something wrong
with the people 
""
And 
""
""
""
""
""
There wasn't anything  the
ideology 
""
Well the people in power were  wrong
""
They went wrong 
""
And they and their system 
""
And  intervention from the part of
""
""
They were trying for a long time  to destroy the Soviet Union
since its 
""
They have been trying  for a long time to destroy the set- up
""
""
Well Stalin with his iron hands  uh prevent the
Soviet set-up from destruction 
""
But the later 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  uhm
""
""
Can a thing be prevented with iron hands 
""
""
Yes many things  with iron hands
""
""
Means they are  prevented
""
""
For example  that was what that was what Stalin Stalin
did in Russia  uhn
""
""
""
""
""
Or if something is prevented with iron hands 
uhn 
uhn  destroyed by iron hands
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Suppose someone is going to destroy your society  and
suppose there is strong person  to protect
the society 
""
He is saving the society 
""
So that was exactly what 
""
""
 who oppose
""
""
You know the
""
""
But those who oppose if you destroy them 
then it means that you are doing a something good for the society 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes if the society has a cancer of hand  it has to be cut
""
""
Who is going to decide 
""
""
It is the people 
""
""
If it is the people  then other people had any voice
""
""
Well
""
""
If is a person  goes on destroying everyone
""
""
Communism cannot succeed without the support of the people
""
""
That was what happened  Kerala
""
For example 
""
Why did it fail in Kerala and West Bengal 
""
Because it wasn't a popular movement 
""
So communism failed  fail in
Kerala 
""
It was because 
opponents of that particular movement 
""
""
Okay fine
""
""
Means uh if  it
means people are not with Communism 
""
""
""
""
""
People are still with communism in Russia 
""
You know the way they  they executed communism
""
""
""
In what sense it is 
""
""
What sense it is
""
""
What what 
then they have something like politbureau  and the
members of the politbureau  infact again become
previleged people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah yeah that 
""
""
""
 in their hand
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
It means  ultimately leads to
hurt
""
""
See there is nothing 
""
Because you know 
""
""
Who went wrong 
""
""
 at
the helm of affairs 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not supporters of communism
""
The people who were in power 
there was Gorbochov 
""
""
""
""
""
Now actually these people
""
""
 who got the Nobel
Prize
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Why did he accept the Nobel Prize 
""
What was Bernard  when he was awarded
the Nobel Prize 
""
Bernard Shaw was not a pure communist  but this man Gorbochov
""
""
And who are noble  of uh
weapon intended to destroy humanity 
""
Marxism stands for humanity 
""
It is for the preservation of humanity 
""
And this man  meant for the
""
""
So in that way 
""
""
""
""
""
 into power he comes
because of popular support 
""
But once he comes into power  power
greedy
""
He is after more and more power  and ultimately what happens he
finds everything is centred in him 
he goes at basic principles of 
""
""
See this was not what happened in 
""
You may know about  Perestroika and Glasnot
""
""
""
 but there also again what
happens we find  they were previleged
people there 
""
But with if Marx 
""
""
""
""
""
 not so in the past
""
""
And the society  he
wants to have a classless society 
""
And that dream he had 
""
""
Well 
""
""
Okay fine  uhm
uhm
""
""
How did you enjoy your stay here 
""
""
I enjoyed 
""
""
Why 
""
""
Because you know it is a very different sort of experience
""
""
Because  uhm
""
""
We can not sit like this  uh tanned
""
""
So  a
change 
""
Now  uh both physically
and mentally 
""
And so 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah how did you enjoy your stay here 
""
""
Very fine 
""
""
Fine 
""
""
Well
""
""
How fine 
""
""
Because all the while  I was in the company of very nice
people  those who have
very  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well in that way you too 
""
You propogate Hinduism  Islam
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh yes 
yeah 
how are they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In fact uh  they had asked me to
buy  buy them uhm this thing the sunglasses
""
""
Have they missed you a lot 
""
""
Yeah they did miss me in fact they were waiting for their
sunglasses
""
As soon as I went home  uh asked me for the
sunglasses 
""
Luckily I bought bought two bought two 
""
For the one 
""
So he always wearing it 
uh he asked me 
""
Then when my daughter it fitted very well 
""
So luckily  I I could I could bring I can buy them
""
If not I would have had a tough time 
""
Then then my daughter wanted some jewels something like that
""
She she cried 
""
Then I promised to buy some silk  for for
my wife  from Mysore
""
Then she she wasn't very keen
""
She said okay fine
""
I think I get good one to buy 
""
Then my  saree
""
""
Then two of her sisters also wanted  so I
""
""
These are going to come about four thousand  rupees
""
""
So yes I  yes I can
get get the whole thing for about three thousand five hundred even that 
I'll 
""
So  just thinking what I should do
""
""
What 
""
""
But then of course I have a hell of time travelling  uh I
mean from here to  uh
once again to Ooty 
""
No this is in Mysore stays and here and back
""
Rather bit too much 
""
For for first time  so much of
trouble travelling
