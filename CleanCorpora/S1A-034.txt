<I>
""
""
""
""
""
 when are we leaving to your place
""
""
""
 one
word 
""
""
""
and 
""
""
""
""
I liked it very much 
""
""
I never imagined that 
""
Perhaps 
""
""
Yeah Lucknow used to be very very hot 
""
And  with the
intention of visiting a new city 
""
I didn't have any idea about the weather 
""
When I  uh I asked my sister how Mysore
would be like  uh well it would be as good as
Bengal 
""
Now I  right in a way
""
""
But you know 
""
Now
""
""
I don't know about Sushila  one or two words
""
""
""
Now  uh it
proved to be a bit  of
course  friends like
you and Patil and Asok and all that 
""
I don't miss my home as much 
""
""
But even then  made
quite long 
""
""
""
""
""
 to be away from
home 
""
""
And especially  to my
to your room 
""
""
""
 when you
returned 
yeah yeah 
""
To enter the empty room 
""
""
""
""
""
Of course with Sushila with with  you
 daughterly
 that the cheerful charming sweet and all
that 
""
But then we know 
 it is illusion
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Suddenly you begin to feel early in evening  she is always
there 
""
But you know  I think you got
 long Sushila
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And now  out of
job 
""
""
""
""
""
Before she 
""
""
""
""
""
There is no worry  formerly I used to think about my lesson
moreover what shall I talk
""
""
Exactly exactly to keep you busy
""
""
Yeah it kept me mentally busy 
attending this classes 
""
""
Unless I  say
""
""
I have got nothing else nothing to do 
""
So 
""
""
I would I will say participate like that
""
""
""
""
""
 you know
""
""
I just I just  now this is no
""
""
""
I don't know but I think uh
""
""
It was a very good experience uh 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
We had a nice time together 
""
""
And this evening we spent about half an hour  uh uh with
Sushila  one
word 
""
""
The blanket on a blanket 
""
""
Blanket with the shawl that she has done 
""
And my  uh
colours 
""
""
 one or two
words 
""
""
""
""
And uh by the by the way it is interesting that 
we've 
""
Especial reference to  Sushila was one of
the main person 
""
A statement about  her and uh
""
""
Short nose  classical
 from Madras
""
""
That was a very compliment  comprehending
with uh historical persons 
""
""
Complimenting 
""
Otherwise she would feel uh 
""
There is no embarrassing thinking but uhm  these are the
features and especially the sharp long nose  and I think of that
""
""
Who is this lady  ?
""
""
Uh  uh Kishangarh
school and all that 
""
You will find that uh most  who are usually
dressed  they acted
like 
""
Unless you think of it  when it loses us
""
""
And I wouldn't fall on it 
""
But today we started talking about it

""
""
So uh  leaving on the twenty seventh
""
""
""
