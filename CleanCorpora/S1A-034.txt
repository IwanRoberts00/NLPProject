 One word Sushila 
 So Shushilaji when are we leaving to your place
 I'm leaving on the twenty ninth of one
word 
 What is your impression of Mysore last year 
and whether you like 
 Mysore is a beautiful city 
I liked it very much 
I never imagined that it's a beautiful city 
Perhaps because I stayed in Lucknow Hostel and even 
Yeah Lucknow used to be very very hot 
And when I came to Mysore I came here with the
intention of visiting a new city 
I didn't have any idea about the weather in Mysore 
When I reached Bangalore uh I asked my sister how Mysore
would be like and she said that uh well it would be as good as
Bengal 
Now I come to know that my sister was uh right in a way
But you know 
Now
I don't know about Sushila she is she one or two words
 all that and Asok is also 
Now I see you can we one word uh it
proved to be a bit cough troublesome for me Sushila of
course you are there and I'm surrounded by friends like
you and Patil and Asok and all that 
I don't miss my home as much 
But even then one word made
quite long one or two words 
 Now 
 One month is a long time to be away from
home 
And especially food and when you come back to my
to your room uh you don't exactly like a warm that's 
 Yeah especially in the evening when you
returned from from the institute you feel rather home sick 
yeah yeah 
To enter the empty room when nobody is there to 
 Yeah yeah 
Of course with Sushila with with neighbour you
 there is a kind of compensation kind of uh sisterly daughterly
 yeah persons that the cheerful charming sweet and all
that 
But then we know that this is a kind of a medicine 
 yeah the family insists on but it is illusion
 I know 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Suddenly you begin to feel early in evening she is always
there 
But you know up to the twenty first of June I think you got
 whole long Sushila
Yeah
And now when I'm as if I'm out of
job because the part of job it is yeah 
 Part of job it is yeah 
Before she a few words 
 A few words 
There is no worry formerly I used to think about my lesson
moreover what shall I talk
Exactly exactly to keep you busy
Yeah it kept me mentally busy and now I'm 
attending this classes 
Unless I must say
I have got nothing else nothing to do 
So in first the first thing that seem one word 
I would I will say participate like that
 It clearly give it a hope 
 Hope hope you know
I just I just missed it all hope now this is no
 eat for getting to missed it so the only thing is that 
I don't know but I think uh
It was a very good experience uh 
Yeah 
 A few words 
We had a nice time together all of us 
And this evening we spent about half an hour uh uh with
Sushila uh talking about the sarees that she one
word 
The blanket on a blanket 
Blanket with the shawl that she has done 
And my one word we started talking about uh
colours patterns and one or two words 
 We're just allowed because one or two
words 
 Which colour will go with that person 
And uh by the by the way it is interesting that that's 
we've got this thing about the Indian beauty 
Especial reference to women and uh Sushila was one of
the main person but she didn't feel embarrassed laughter 
A statement about her and uh
Short nose tall uh reminding of uh classical
 upbringing and all that she's from Madras
That was a very compliment comp comprehending
with uh historical persons 
Complimenting compliment uh compliment they are true 
Otherwise she would feel uh furious 
There is no embarrassing thinking but uhm these are the
features and especially the sharp long nose and I think of that
Who is this lady ?
Uh I don't have uh Rajasthani painting uh Kishangarh
school and all that 
You will find that uh most uh women who are usually
dressed as they were queens uh people of royal family they acted
like a you know each and one or two words cough 
Unless you think of it you you relaxed when it loses us
 it occurred to me there is something there 
And I wouldn't fall on it 
But today we started talking about it and then you know uh 
you get uh uh uh a few words 
So uh now that I'm leaving on the twenty seventh
 a few words 
And you are all alone 
How long uh will be your journey uh perhaps
Actually if I leave this place and go straight to Burdwan
then it won't take uh uh very long time compare to other such thing like
Longest longest longest way 
 Longest 
 It's about uh sixty-five hours but I'm 
going via Hyderabad because I'm leaving on the twenty-fifth
evening 
Are you going to stay there or ?
Yeah I'll stay there for five days from
twenty-eight to second
Third morning I'll be going to one word and
I will be reaching home on fourth 
You are leaving on the twenty-ninth

So called the Mysore one or two words 
It doesn't go to via Bangalore

And you are not going back right now 
I think you'll be making trip to 
Like travelling travelling to Salem this
places at Salem and one word 
But everything will lack one word when I am in
Bangalore in my sister because uh now is my problem I find I
would have to yeah take care of lots of things
 Salem

Then it was a
Cannot move that on the way 
Yeah yeah depends upon the reservation train time and
