interpretation of past events 
""
This particularly has affected the representation of women in history
""
""
In part one of the series Dr Chakravarty discussed the inherent biases
""
Buddhist periods 
""
""
epics 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Socio-religious Reform Movements that we see at that time  uh would you
""
""
foregrounded  ?
""
""
Well actually this is uh  this is the question and this is
""
rewriting of history 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the way in which the uh  uh had structured its
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
construction of their culture being 
""
Now what is interesting is that the colonial power tends to look at
this in two ways 
""
""
 the culture that they had come into
confrontation with  recognition that this
was 
""
""
enterprise
""
""
sanskrit text who  who uh uhm you know
discovered new works and so on
""
And so there was a  certain understanding about the past which
began to be constructed
""
But it was done clearly from the point of view of the  uh of the
""
better administrators 
""
""
""
""
""
""
superiority of the conquerors and the  and the legitimacy of their
""
""
But at the same time it also ended up in uh  making sweeping
""
""
Now what happened during this period is to begin to  identify
the status of women 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There was for example a woman like Pandita Ramabai who was
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
were authentic certain were  certain traditions had been interpolated
""
""
""
""
""
construction of the Vedic uh  period as a golden age for women actually
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in the  hoary past uh the status of women had been high
""
That certain aberrations developed  and that these needed to be
""
""
Uh at the same time the adversaries also used the  Shastras
""
indigenous they were an inherent part of  Indian tradition
""
All this resulted in a tremendous historical consciousness being uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
was vigorous 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
very important at this time  should
""
""
""
""
""
""
minds of women in the past 
""
""
information
""
""
""
""
""
And they wouldn't tell you that  uh the debate had been on uhm
""
""
That when  uhm Yagnavalka with two
""
""
otherwise your head will fall off 
""
""
""
""
""
""
But  in any case this kind of enterprise went on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
whole reconstruction of the past 
""
""
women who  uh in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
well as into the present would be Ramabai
""
She travelled extensively 
she was exposed to a number of practices and uh she uh  evokes this in the
""
""
""
""
""
And she is  really interesting because she turns the arguments
""
section of the nationalist 
""
""
""
""
""
he talked about the status of women being high in the Vedic period and
""
""
""
says  reason why we are a subject nation is because if
women are subject how can they produce sons  who are not psychologically
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So she talks about the situation which pertains to a widow  and
""
""
And she uses Manu
""
She says  emaciate
""
must never ever mentioned the name of another man  after her husband has
died 
""
Until death let her be patient of hardships  self-control and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
directness with which she is confronting the problem
""
""
certain set of rules for women
""
And the uh  double standard of morality something that she
exposes  marvelously
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
include women 
""
""
""
""
as mothers  would you like to talk about that ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  Dayanand goes back to the Vedas
""
""
""
""
a new race of heroes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh
""
place 
""
""
niyoga  right that women had
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
would like to perpetuate
""
Now 
""
And he suggests that uh 
""
""
So he does that on the one the hand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
He uses the biological  uh and regulates
""
""
""
actually feed their own  children because these should be handed to a
""
possible to a situation where she can conceive at the time when she is 
""
or whatever or whatever which will  which is the best time from the point
""
""
""
medical knowledge to uh  set of rules which does at one
level apparently raised the status of women  but which in in a sense
