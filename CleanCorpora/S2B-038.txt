Conversation with Dr Uma Chakravarty we have have
 been trying to understand how history shaped by the selective
interpretation of past events 
This particularly has affected the representation of women in history
In part one of the series Dr Chakravarty discussed the inherent biases
in historical sources looking particularly at women in the Vedic and
Buddhist periods 
In the second part we went on to look at women in mythology and the
epics 
In the third we discussed the Bhakti tradition and the Medieval
period 
Today in our concluding session we would look at the representation of
women at the turn of the century and soon after 
Now uh coming to the nineteenth century and the
Socio-religious Reform Movements that we see at that time uh would you
like to comment on the context in which suddenly we so
called woman question acquires prominence suddenly woman question is
foregrounded what is the context in which this happen ?
Well actually this is uh this is the question and this is
an area which is com tied up completely with our uh the the
rewriting of history 
Uh the enterprise of uh writing history 
Uh what you get in the nineteenth century is a uh a rather
dramatic confrontation between two different cultures 
Uh with what appears to be a visible difference in way 
in which the colonial power uh structured its gender relations and
the way in which the uh the colonised power uh had structured its
gender relations
And this is not a confrontation which is on an equilitarian
basis but on clearly on an unequal basis 
So what you get is uh the British as the conquerors uh
 with their understanding of both of their own culture as well as of the
culture that they are now uh exposed to 
And the uh Indians who were reacting to uh a certain kind of
construction of their culture being uh made by the colonial power 
Now what is interesting is that the colonial power tends to look at
this in two ways 
One is to discuss what they consider to be a uhm you know the
 the positive values of this the culture that they had come into
confrontation with and a certain kind of uh uh recognition that this
was uh an ancient culture with various defined rules and so on 
And this more or less uhm coincided with the orientalist
enterprise
That is the orientalists who you know uhm translated the
sanskrit text who uh who collected works who uh uhm you know
discovered new works and so on
And so there was a certain understanding about the past which
began to be constructed
But it was done clearly from the point of view of the uh of the
British who needed to know these uh all these in terms of being
better administrators 
Simultaneously there was a fairly strong and noticeable
reaction by the British uh which ended up in in in a sense
condemning the culture that they had uhm uh come into uh contact with
And this is done partly because uh it also would indicate the moral
superiority of the conquerors and the and the legitimacy of their
enterprise
But at the same time it also ended up in uh making sweeping
condemnations of the entire culture
Now what happened during this period is to begin to identify
the status of women with the civilisation as uh it it became the 
uh index of a civilisation 
So the status of women uh would then decide whether the
civilisation was ha something that was valuable or not 
And this is what happened during the nineteenth century
Now it also tied in with the the understanding of a how one
needed to reform the structure of relation 
Uh what practice is needed to be uh stamped out or uh
what kind of changes needed to be introduced 
And uh here again there were two different ways in which you
can look at it
 There was there was the British uh view point 
there was also uh development from within the uh Indians which
was also similarly interested in certain degree of reform 
There was for example a woman like Pandita Ramabai who was
writing 
Uh a little later uhm little later but early on
for instance in the early uhm nineteenth century you have some uh
 say the whole discussion of sati and the need to
legislate on sati bringing forth the kind of literature
that Rajaram Mohan Roy and his adversaries generated on the women's
 question
And here here the women's question became central 
Because uh you and and the use of the text also became central
because it was important to try and establish that several traditions
were authentic certain were certain traditions had been interpolated
So the reformers used the Shastras to indicate
that uh certain practices were not there in the ancient hoary past
This is the period in which the beginnings of the Vedic the
construction of the Vedic uh period as a golden age for women actually
 began
Uhm
Uh because it was important to try and say that at some point
in the hoary past uh the status of women had been high
That certain aberrations developed and that these needed to be
stamped out 
Uh at the same time the adversaries also used the Shastras
 to state that the uh the practices were actually
indigenous they were an inherent part of Indian tradition
All this resulted in a tremendous historical consciousness being uh
 generated or about the past in in which a lot of people were 
 into uh involved uhm and 
la later the nationalist came into the fray and
they needed again to reconstruct the past along the lines that they
wanted
And they did this with a particular point from a particular point
of view because they restructured gender relations but they also 
 restructure restructured the images of men and women
Means they created a uh uh a kind of a new man who 
was vigorous who was uh dynamic who was not at all a an effete person 
which is how the Britisher cast Indians 
Uh uh effete emasculated kind of person but someone who was
 uhm was strong who've who's marshall who was who
was capable of uh the highest courage 
And the Vedic period died after that because the Aryan uh was a
militant marshall uh person 
Simultaneously they did this the same thing for women so
women got developed in two ways 
Uh one was to look at women from the point of view of the uh uh 
practices that they had be been familiar
with
So Gargi for instance and the episode of Gargi becomes very
very important at this time one to say that women had should
have access to learning now 
And there was a debate raging on whether women should study or not
 in Bengal 
At the same time uh it did indicate the status in their
minds of women in the past 
And so one would get for instance a certain half baked half
information
For instance Gargi the Gargi narrative was always used
to say that Gargi was learned she could debate Yagnavalka but they didn't
complete the story
And they wouldn't tell you that uh the debate had been on uhm
 unfair grounds and had been terminated on unfair grounds
That when uh Gargi uhm fixed uhm Yagnavalka with two
subtle questions which he would not be able to handle and which he
was not able to handle he simply said uhm shut up woman
otherwise your head will fall off 
And uh he ended the debate on that note
Now the nationalist obviously could not bring the later part
 because this would be a reflection on their ancient past 
But in any case this kind of enterprise went on
Simultaneously they also highlighted uh a certain 
kshtriya values for women 
And so they created new kind of men and a new kind of 
wo womam 
Now Ramabai uh interestingly didn't quite fit in with this
whole reconstruction of the past 
Uh Ramabai's was unusual because she was one of the few
women who knew Sanskrit had been taught Sanskrit by her father uh in
fact by her mother 
Uh who then studied the the text and who obviously was not
satisfied with the kind of answer that she found in her text 
So that Ramabai became a little bit of an embarassment to 
the uhm to atleast one section of the nationalist not to all of them
Now Ramabai is is extremely important from our point of view
Because if you if we were to say who's who's one uh
 one of the first uh women to be perceptive about the uh status of
women 
Uh one of the first investigator as it were into the past as
well as into the present would be Ramabai
She travelled extensively but uh during one word 
she was exposed to a number of practices and uh she uh evokes this in the
text that she wrote which is called the High Caste Hindu Widow
 
Now here she talks about the low status of women 
And she is really interesting because she turns the arguments
of this both the uhm English and the nationalist in a sense a
section of the nationalist uh wrong 
Now whereas people had judged the uh index of civilisation
 by the low status of women and this is what the British had done 
Uh simultaneously someone like Dayananda had turned it around and
he talked about the status of women being high in the Vedic period and
therefore this in civilisation being uh fine
Ramabai actually talks about psychological fear and she
says that the reason why we are a subject nation is because if
women are subject how can they produce sons who are not psychologically
uh cowards 
And so she turns the argument fully around
Now hers is a really fascinating enterprise uh she uh was
both reformist as well as knowledgable 
And uh her handling of the women's question has a kind
of sharpness and it it extraordinarily moving I mean uh for instance 
uhm there is this marvellous passage that she had on the uh 
completely unequal uh relations between men and women
So she talks about the situation which pertains to a widow and
the situation which obtains to a widower
And she uses Manu
She says Let her emi emaciate
 her body by living on pure flowers roots and fruits but she
must never ever mentioned the name of another man after her husband has
died 
Until death let her be patient of hardships self-control and
chaste 
Then she goes on and she says The rules for the widower
 a twice born man versed in the sacred law shall burn a wife of the
equal caste 
And having at the funeral given sacred fires to his wife who
dies before him he may marry again and again kindle the one word
 fires 
And the way she juxtoposes the two you know indicates the
directness with which she is confronting the problem
Here are a set of rules for men here are the certain 
certain set of rules for women
And the uh double standard of morality something that she
exposes marvelously
She does this as far as uh infanticide uh she in a sense
she is one of the first recorders of statistics because she talks about
female infanticide and so on
So her experience is actually uh quite unique and is
something that historians all historians uh should this you know
should open themselves upto
But certainly she is very important for rewriting history to
include women 
Uh in in an early conversation with you you had mentioned
that Dayanand Saraswati has some very interesting things to say about women
as mothers yeah would you like to talk about that ?
 Yeah 
Yes sure
Uh well you know uhm Dayanand goes back to the Vedas
for uh for uhm a lot of the uh kind of practices that he would
now write like to bring back 
So he he gives to women a very central role in uh creating
a new race of heroes 
Now in doing this he is able to simultaneously deal with the uh
women as wife but also deal with the widow who is a 
is a problem in nineteenth century and who is an embarassment to
many of the reformers
He uh brings back and he talks about the practice of 
niyoga which is very interesting because niyoga
 uh in the vedic time had been the possibilities of uh uh
rearing a son for the dead husband uh by appointing somebody else in his
place 
Now this is a practice and uh lot has been made of 
niyoga as a positive right that women had
But uh uh in the Vedic period let's not make any uhm
 let's not confuse the issue uh it remains a prerogative uh
 which is available to the kinsmen of the household to ensure that
reproduction uh is uh continues
 It's it's the right to remarry or to co-habit but 
under rules which uh which previleged men and the cultural norms that they
would like to perpetuate
Now Dayanand uses this 
And he suggests that uh that uh widows can use 
niyoga to have a series of son
So he does that on the one the hand 
But he also because of concern is very strongly for a a new race
For a race of people who are strong and rigorous 
He uses the biological power of women uh and regulates
 for it 
Now for instance he suggests that women uh must not uh 
actually feed their own children because these should be handed to a
wetnurse because a woman should return to uh uhm as quickly as
possible to a situation where she can conceive at the time when she is 
best equipped for it which is between the years of sixteen and say thirty
or whatever or whatever which will which is the best time from the point
of view of reproduction
So he uhm he uses both traditional knowledge as well as
medical knowledge to uh propose a set of rules which does at one
level apparently raised the status of women but which in in a sense
actually it is seeing women as stock breeders
