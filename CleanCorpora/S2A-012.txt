<I>
This is the captain of the Haryana side and trying to
 get back into the Indian team 
 That's Ram Saran 
Gurdeep Singh Sanjeev Ram Saran on the crossing there 
and uh empire Sachin Navadia who was this side of the team at the
moment is supervising the match with uh T S Bullard on the
opposite side 
 That's Gurdeep Singh 
No no 
Kishan Singh stop there by Shakira 
Jagbir obstruct it 
Narendra number two Gurdeep Singh he has been playing very
well I am sure in this tournament 
Sanjeev Kumar kicks there 
Sanjay Bisht India player 
Gurdeep Singh and there is Mukesh Kumar playing there 
Still in possession still got the ball in position now Balbir
Sahani hold out for off time 
A gentle stroke Saki who picked up that ball for Haryana
Ashok Kumar stopped it Gurdeep Singh on Baljit 
Baljit in possession 
Ball given to him by Baljit Singh off there he
knew his position all over the island and now Indian Airline
trying to make headway 
A beaten there 
Sanjay Bhatia 
Haryana into move now 
Baljit coming five men across the struck in the process
 ball over the striker but no chance Ram Saran could not get a
strike 
Good to be the goal the play he eject at last certain
bid of the touch to uh a straight ball and we have a goal out 
But Ram Saran missed and the first chance for Haryana 
has gone a waste
Manoj Kumar very ferocious outside 
The ball is in possession 
A sure goal there for Mukesh Kumar 
He will play final decision into the crossway 
Oh he made a loss of it but he did a better job but it was 
Gurdeep who could have stick out there and uh Mukesh lost possession 
Anyway they have a corner ball hit and now let us see
what uh uh this Ranjit Kumar can do but then Gundeep has come
back there 
Ram Saran in good lead trying to make headway obstructed and
kicks watch again Gundeep men who gets a drift put the ball at
far square on that uh Sanjeev Kumar got a catch from good run get
hold of the ball 
Amar Singh Negi that was who were outside from the ball from
there and uh play it for uh Indian Airline
Shakeel Ahmed 
Down to Mukesh Kumar 
Mukesh moving well today 
He had a practice tournament here Baljit Gundeep on
to the Ram Saran 
Ram Saran still in the lead ahead couple of yards but I am
sure he knows that he is not there in his own position and that's
 end of a ball flight
So another cross wasted 
Harvinder Sanjay Bisht Rajpal to Mukesh Kumar but ball
 a little bit uh shallow and it goes out before he had it 
Final of this Federation Cup 
The first five minutes did not produce uh yielding 
unexpected but Haryan definitely having as much of the game as
Indian Airlines
Gundeep trying to make headway and uh fully that ball out
in the two words 
Ball deflected out to corner 
So in the first corner Indian Airlines the Airlines have won
 and now its turn of Haryana and taking the corner hit is uh
 Gundeep Kumar 
He goes to a former India player 
Gundeep and they all charging here and deflected 
Gundeep Kumar stop there by Mohammad Arif 
Tries his scoop doesn't do it well and touch the penalty
corner in a good way 
Baljit Singh is going to take the push and is going to be
 well Gurdeep Singh for the hit also near him Ram Saran
 Mukesh Kumar and uh that's it 
And what a lovely shot there is a good short there tries
to the corner 
But got to face the one word Gundeep Kumar try to
make a big hit 
He was to make well but misfield but tries well 
Second penalty corner on to a real big shot two words 
The Haryana boys are putting the pressure over Indian
Airlines 
Another penalty corner second corner now two words
 Baljit Kumar Baljit Kumar who played one play ball is out there
 he always have to play around Sanjay Bisht one word teaming
up with Sanjay Bisht 
He is a bit of trying hard and driving 
It is secure there by Kishan Singh and given on to 
Gundeep and over to Daljit it's over to Sukumar 
 Saran Kumar has given up there uh moving this uh 
defence why middle of exchange of will serve
And thinking of strucking by and empire Sachin Navadia serving
the call to penalty corner 
 That's Daljit taking collecting by Kuldeep side
 in time ball deflected out corner 
Here penalty corner kick 
He did it for two words but went for the straight shot
 but uh the ball was deflected there by goalkeeper 
Subbaiah's stick and in corner now Sanjay Bisht in possession
Now that is uh Negi 
A misfield for Haryana 
Haryana definetly doing most of the attacking in this first
half 
And uh considering that they are the under dogs for this
final is certainly well good cheer up to what Jagbir does now 
And crossing there and uh again got the chance lost 
I mean the score still one as it here appears over to Kuku
Wadia
 In Hindi 
For our viewers now we have that man here Mr K P S
 Gill
You have been watching Mr Gill the matches in this
Federation Cup practically everyday 
Did you find any outstanding talent during these last few days ?
Uh most of the players uh who were there in the camp 
uh are again been asked to join the camp and we've found
about seven new faces here who will be asked to come into
the camp 
But watching Haryana I've been very impressed with
their play 
Yes specially Sanjeev Kumar is doing exceptionally well
Yes uh and I want to have a separate look at
Haryana altogether
I want to see how they impress so with such team 
And they have been really been playing together 
And I believe you have and the half the team from Punjab
 and half the team from Haryana 
Uh there are players from Punjab Sindh Bank there are players
from B S F uh but basically it's uh it's not of
 team which has played together for a long team
Yes they have impressed considerably 
Now what do you think uh should be done as far as uh if
you go round the whole Jalandhar you see the boards a revival of the
Indian hockey being planned 
Now what you are going about doing that ?
You see uh at the moment uh certain planning has
gone in as far as Asian Games are concerned and thereafter the
World Cup 
But I will be looking after the uh Champions Trophy and the
Olympic Games ninety-five and ninety-six and uh then after that
And the objective will be to win these two tournaments 
So far as the Asian Games is concerned uh it's 
obvious the time is very short 
Now but do you have any graded procedures to raise the
standard of hockey in India ?
Uh for these two tournaments which are 
coming up immediately there is nothing much we can add on to what
has been happening 
But for the tournaments which are in ninety-five and ninety-six
 we will have to launch a massive talent search by the end of this year
 pick up a large number of good players and trained them at
different places 
And then try to see that there is an overall uhm raising of
the standard so that when we go into the Champions Trophy 
and subsequently the Olympic uh uh we're going as a combination
which is feared all over the world 
Now you have about forty odd boys in the camp at
Chandigarh juniors 
Now what you are going to do about them ?
Those are the boys who've been selected uh from
various camps which were held in country including some boys from the
 Academy Airlines Academy and uh in Delhi 
Now we are trying to constituent a team because we have
been invited for juniors double games in Australia and Spain 
and in Germany 
The idea is to try and send out fit teams to these two countries
And then watch for these players show 
May you also have a long term life as concerning 
youngsters in the country 
What you want to do about them ?
You see I've been talking to people uh 
who've uh been associated with hockey and I find that one
of the recommendations is that we should trust in young 
So by winter of this year November we shall be
launching a talent search all over the country for the age group ten to
fourteen 
And we will try to get these players into uh centre where
astro-turf is there 
So that they can start playing on astro-turf 
And uh also they will be given uh all sort of uh
fitness uh programme over the next few years 
So that uh they build up strength they build up stamina and
build up speed and simultaneously the hockey skills adopted 
In addition to that uh thereafter from next year onwards 
we will keep on adding on by having a look at the boys ten years
old and selecting them to keep on to uh enter this uh
stream
So that we always have good players whenever you ask 
Anyway let's hope your leadership Mr Gill
 will uh bring the revival of the Indian hockey 
Thank you very much
Thank you 
Okay let's come down here at the Burlton Park
stadium 
And the pace in the game has slowed down 
Also then Indian Air Airlines 
are having a diffi difficult time 
containing this Haryana force 
Though they have nothing to fear they'll be making
the break through they have been searching for all through this back uptill
now 
So far as Airline had three good chances very well done I mean
strike 
In fact that's Haryana it can goal
He must be having to chose between and uh that's the
ultimately it goes to the penalty corner decision and Mohammed Arif
has always been scoring for the Indian Airlines 
One penalty corner but he didn't do it to get
And Haryana on to down this
There is this new break in Haryana team
Now after this kick for Indian Airlines
Good throw ball there for Rajinder Singh but Baljit Singh
takes ball there and comes out in the clear still in possession 
Miracle there by Sanjay Bhatia and put it through
 Sanjeev and uh Kurian Indian Airlines but that's 
true there is a lot of doing 
Sanjeev Bhatia trying to make headway down the left flank
 not successful 
Free hit to be taken now by Gurdeep Singh 
Now the the frail Haryana push back and Tandon given
service in this competition 
Every match practically he has played very well 
Baljit Gundeep Kumar 
 Haryana side in possession Harinder gets it 
And lose it call after to Bhutia and back to Harinder
 and on to Mohammed Arif 
Arif is the India pull back who has been on the India team
 over the last four tournaments abroad 
And let's see what Shakeel Ahmed the captain of
India do 
It was a good throw there by Jagbir but uh it was twist there
by Kishan Singh 
And a free hit for Indian Airlines just outside the
penalty corner 
Shakeel Ahmed back to Sanjay Bisht 
Getting to the centre you can see the wet ground there 
That is as I talk a little shower we had it's the
 one word now at the moment but uh towards uh this uh 
one word in this two words on this to put up pace 
Pick the ball now Sanjeev Kumar for Haryana 
The ball there by Harvinder of course he may 
recording broken and Sanjeev takes it to the end 
It was through the drive reflection that was two words 
Harvinder tried on numerous occasion one side Gundeep Kumar on
the other side Jagbir Singh 
Both have been missing constantly 
They drop the best chance anybody could have asked for 
But the one that Gundeep Kumar had in the first half when
uh Sanjeev Kumar put him through 
When he made unstopper to chance and Haryana are
still fighting to get the ball uptill now 
Indian Airlines on the attack now 
Ajay Singh in possession say in twist breath first Rawat
Gundeep Kumar has gone in plan to tame now and he gets all the
back over there 
 Bhishan had good match today 
Trying to make headway gets near of the goal line but it was
brought down by that water there 
Even then he tried but the ball was stuck in slush but here is
water and one word 
And foul there uh by Sanjay Bisht 
And Sanjeev Kumar trying to make headway and uh driving
first Shakeel Ahmed who has gone down on the ground there and he was
trying to push him through there 
And uh inadvertently Sanjeev Kumar stick went into his stomach
now look at it 
It was not an intentional foul but uh Shakeel went down
And he is getting medical attention 
We are seeing the man with the T-shirt and uh the white
T-shirt and the red cap he was the former captain of India 
Have won and the final penalty corner hit as in the game and
coming behind there is Subbaiah being played and was was played
by India on numerous occasion 
And uh with the absence of Ashish Ballal who has hurt his
knee in camp Subbaiah has been functioning all through uh
I mean all matches here while uh if Ballal was there he would not
have been here 
So anyway it's why he doesn't to the occasion and he
has functioned very well indeed 
Against Bombay he brought out on that lovely chase and again
today he is pitied against in fact the reasons are behind Gundeep
Kumar not making uh sure shots at goal was that he was afraid that if
he doesn't keep the ball in the right place he would not be able to beat
Subbaiah 
So Subbaiah is is slogging with jats that's 
frustrating the Haryana forwards 
Though one must say that uh Gundeep Kumar and then Baljit
would have the chance to score but they did not make 
Now later half begin 
Mukesh Kumar switches to two words 
It is obstructed there by Baljit Singh 
Played inside return pass square Mukesh Kumar 
And Mukesh drive it towards Shakeel luckily Shakeel gets hold
of Pramod Kumar and this side is Sanjay Bisht trying to make hit 
He hit that ball and comprising out of course hitting
dangerous play free hit for Haryana 
Kishan Singh Kishan Singh on to Ram Saran 
Ram Saran still holding up the ball 
He is looking out for a hit somebody in the clear does
round and loses possession there but it is lucky for him it's 
two words 
Not one word Sanjeev Bhatia 
Again he still loves his crossing there and has gone to
Baljit 
Baljit he is coming Gundeep Kumar in the clear now 
 let's see whether he can do anything uh unable to beat Harvinder
Singh 
Mukesh Kumar in possession 
Mounting the attack for Indian Airlines is Rajinder Singh
there 
Given on to Jagbir Singh
