Good to be the goal  certain
bid of the touch

But Ram Saran missed 
has gone a waste
""
Manoj Kumar 
""
The ball is in possession 
""
A sure goal there for Mukesh Kumar 
""
He will play final decision into the crossway 
""
Oh he made a loss of it but he did a better job but it was 
Gurdeep who could have stick out there and uh 
""
Anyway they have a corner  and now let us see
what uh  Gundeep has come
back there 
""
Ram Saran in good lead trying to make headway obstructed  and
kicks  put the ball at
far square  Sanjeev Kumar got a catch from good run get

there  Indian Airline
""
Shakeel Ahmed 
""
Down to Mukesh Kumar 
""
Mukesh moving well today 
""
He had a practice tournament here  on
to the Ram Saran 
""
Ram Saran still in the lead ahead  but I am
sure he knows that he is not there in his own position  that's
 end of a ball flight
""
So 
""
Harvinder  Rajpal to Mukesh Kumar but ball
""
""
Final of this Federation Cup 
""
The first five minutes did not produce uh 
unexpected  as
Indian Airlines
""
Gundeep trying to make headway  fully that ball out
in the 
""
Ball deflected out to corner 
""
So in the first corner  Indian Airlines the Airlines have won
 is uh
""
""
He goes to a former 
""
Gundeep 
""
Gundeep Kumar 
""
Tries his scoop doesn't do it well  penalty
corner in a good way 
""
Baljit Singh is going to take the  and is going to be
 also near him Ram Saran
""
""
And what a lovely shot there  tries
to the corner 
""
But got  Gundeep Kumar try to
make a big hit 
""
He was to make well 
""
Second penalty corner on to a real big shot 
""
The Haryana boys are  over Indian
Airlines 
""
Another penalty corner  two words
 ball is out there
 teaming
up with Sanjay Bisht 
""
He is a bit of trying hard and driving 
""
It is secure there 
Gundeep 
""
""
defence why middle of exchange of will serve
""
And thinking of strucking by  and empire Sachin Navadia serving
the call to penalty corner 
""
 collecting by Kuldeep side
""
""
Here penalty corner kick 
""
He did it for  but went for the straight shot
""
Subbaiah's  in corner now Sanjay Bisht in possession
""
""
Now that is uh 
""
A misfield for Haryana 
""
Haryana definetly doing  most of the attacking in this first
half 
""
And uh  the under dogs for this
final 
""
And 
""
I mean the score still one  as it here appears over to Kuku
Wadia
""
""
""
""
""
For our viewers  Mr K P S
 Gill
""
You have been watching Mr Gill  matches in this
Federation Cup practically everyday 
""
Did you find any outstanding talent during these last few days  ?
""
""
Uh 
uh are  found
about seven  come into
the camp 
""
But watching Haryana  been very impressed with
their play 
""
""
Yes specially Sanjeev Kumar is doing  exceptionally well
""
""
""
Yes  separate look at
Haryana altogether
""
I want to see 
""
And they have been really been playing together 
""
""
And I believe you have  and the half the team from Punjab
""
""
""
Uh there are players from Punjab Sindh Bank there are players
from B S F  not of
 team which has played together for a long team
""
""
Yes 
""
Now what do you think uh  if
you go round the whole Jalandhar you see the  a revival of the
Indian hockey being planned 
""
Now what you are going about  ?
""
""
You see uh  certain planning has
gone in  thereafter the
World Cup 
""
But I will be looking after the  uh Champions Trophy and the
Olympic Games  then after that
""
""
And the objective will be to win these two 
""
""
So far as the Asian Games is concerned 
obvious the time is very short 
""
Now but do you have any  raise the
standard of hockey in India  ?
""
""
Uh 
coming up  there is nothing much we can add on to what
has been happening 
""
But for the  tournaments which are in ninety-five and ninety-six
 we will have to launch a massive talent search by the end of this year
 and trained them at
different places 
""
And then try to see that there is an overall  uhm raising of
the standard 
and subsequently the Olympic  going as a combination
which is feared all over the world 
""
""
Now you have about forty odd boys  in the camp at
Chandigarh 
""
Now what you are going to do about them  ?
""
""
Those are the boys  from
various camps which were held in country  including some boys from the
""
""
Now  trying to constituent a team because we have
been invited for 
and in Germany 
""
The idea is to try and send out fit teams to these two countries
""
""
And then watch for these players show 
""
""
May you also have a long term life 
youngsters in the country 
""
What you want to do about them  ?
""
""
You see 
who've  that one
of the recommendations is that we should trust in young 
""
So by  we shall be
launching a talent search  all over the country for the age group ten to
fourteen 
""
And we will try to  uh centre where
astro-turf is there 
""
So that they can start playing on astro-turf 
""
And uh also  all sort of uh
fitness uh 
""
So that uh  they build up strength they build up stamina and
build up speed 
""
In addition to that uh 
we will keep on adding on  having a look at the boys ten years
old  uh
stream
""
So that we always have good players whenever you ask 
""
""
Anyway  your leadership Mr Gill
""
""
Thank you very much
""
""
Thank you 
""
""
Okay  come down here at the Burlton Park
stadium 
""
And the pace in the game has slowed down 
""
Also then Indian 
are having a 
containing this Haryana force 
""
Though they have nothing to fear  be making
the break through they have been searching for all through this back uptill
now 
""
So far as  Airline had three good chances very well done I mean
strike 
""
In fact  Haryana it can goal
""
He must be having to chose between and uh  the
ultimately it goes to  and Mohammed Arif
has always been scoring for the Indian Airlines 
""
One penalty corner but he didn't do it to get
""
And Haryana on to down this
""
There is this new break in Haryana team
""
Now after this kick  for Indian Airlines
""
Good throw ball there  for Rajinder Singh but Baljit Singh
takes ball there 
""
Miracle there  put it through
""
true there is a lot of doing 
""
Sanjeev Bhatia  trying to make headway down the left flank
""
""
Free hit to be taken now by Gurdeep Singh 
""
Now the the frail Haryana push back  Tandon given
service in this competition 
""
Every match practically he has played very well 
""
Baljit 
""
""
""
And lose it  and back to Harinder
""
""
Arif is the India pull back  who has been on the India team
""
""
And  of
India 
""
It was a good throw there by Jagbir  but uh it was twist there
by Kishan Singh 
""
And a free hit for  the
penalty corner 
""
Shakeel Ahmed 
""
Getting to the centre you can see the wet ground there 
""
That is as I talk  the
""
one word 
""
Pick the ball now Sanjeev Kumar for Haryana 
""
The ball there 
recording broken 
""
It was through the drive reflection that was 
""
Harvinder tried on numerous occasion one side Gundeep Kumar  on
the other side 
""
Both have been missing constantly 
""
They drop the best chance anybody could have asked for 
""
But the one that Gundeep Kumar  when
uh 
""
When he made  and Haryana are
still fighting 
""
Indian Airlines on the attack now 
""
Ajay Singh in possession  first Rawat
""
""
Gundeep Kumar has gone in plan to tame now and he gets all the
back over there 
""
""
""
Trying to make headway gets near of the goal line but it was
brought down by that water there 
""
Even then he tried but the ball was stuck in slush  but here is
water 
""
And foul there 
""
And Sanjeev Kumar trying to make headway  driving
first Shakeel Ahmed who has gone down on the ground there  and he was
trying to push him through there 
""
And uh  inadvertently Sanjeev Kumar stick went into his stomach
now look at it 
""
It was not an intentional foul  Shakeel went down
""
""
And he is getting medical attention 
""
We are seeing the man with the T-shirt  the white
T-shirt and the red cap 
""
Have won and the final penalty corner hit as  in the game and
coming behind there  was played
by India on numerous occasion 
""
And uh  who has hurt his
knee  uh
I mean all matches  while uh if Ballal was there he would not
have been here 
""
So anyway  and he
has functioned 
""
Against Bombay he brought out on that lovely chase  and again
today  the reasons are behind Gundeep
Kumar not  sure shots at goal was that he was afraid that if
he doesn't keep the ball in the right place he would not be able to beat
Subbaiah 
""
So Subbaiah is 
frustrating the Haryana forwards 
""
Though one must say that uh  Gundeep Kumar and then Baljit
would have the chance to score 
""
Now later half begin 
""
Mukesh Kumar 
""
It is 
""
Played inside 
""
And Mukesh drive it towards  Shakeel luckily Shakeel gets hold
of Pramod Kumar 
""
He hit that ball and comprising out  of course hitting
dangerous play 
""
Kishan Singh 
""
Ram Saran still holding up the ball 
""
He is looking out for a hit  does
round and loses possession there but it is lucky for him 
two words 
""
Not 
""
Again he still loves his crossing there  and has gone to
Baljit 
""
Baljit 
 Harvinder
Singh 
""
Mukesh Kumar in possession 
""
Mounting the attack for  Indian Airlines is Rajinder Singh
there 
""
Given on to Jagbir Singh
