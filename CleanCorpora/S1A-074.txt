Department of college Patan 
""
""
Well Mr Shinde 
""
""
""
""
What do you say about 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the previous  it was the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uhm uh other types of marriage 
""
""
But  particularly in
""
""
Is this so  only
""
""
Yes it is a fact 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And so 
""
there is no question of dowry as such 
""
""
But if there is no question of dowry  then why is that the
""
""
""
Will you uh in particularly  if you are from a
Marathi 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I know 
""
I am from uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
time they want the return 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well why is that the dowry system has become  important
nowadays 
""
""
Uh one thing is that  girl's
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Why why because  uhm
""
""
""
Sometimes they demand  or what they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
""
No  uh uh there is no self examination or
""
""
Uh most of the people are tradition bound  because of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But there is nothing for 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  then the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
function 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  uhm most of the time this match-makers they are
relatives of the  uh one of the parties
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
or community work 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if uh  they uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
And see to it that both the parties come together 
""
""
The boy and the girl uh get married 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is they call 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
that is a marriage system  had the right
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are simply making their daughters obey the orders 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well is it going to be the marriage of 
""
""
""
""
Well  in arranged marriages it is not the marriage of two
""
""
Wherever there is uh  is a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Well but now at least  we find people changing their minds
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Why is it so 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh previously  the marriages are
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
They have to remain husband and 
""
But uh so far God has been  uh uh driven away from this world
""
""
""
""
them happy 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
word 
""
""
The people those who have taken divorce you see them  one
""
""
""
 a few words
""
""
""
""
""
Uh in  then
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to happen to their children 
""
""
""
""
""
Now that is the question 
""
Sometimes uh uhm  if the if the matter goes to
the court  of the children
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is to be done about that one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And after that  the
""
""
Because it is  uh his responsibility
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And he is also able to  uh bring them up properly or help
""
""
""
 if they have
""
""
""
""
""
But is it not the duty of the husband  to take proper care of
the  girl
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
But it is not observed nowadays 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir the reason is that  uh the father sometimes he is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the  the daughter cannot become happy
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
will take care of my daughter
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The father  of the
""
""
Sir father think that uh  he has made a wrong choice or
""
""
And sometimes say it  uh two family
""
""
Or the  families doesn't
""
""
""
""
""
""
For the
""
""
They live uh unhappy 
""
""
Well 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well the only thing is that  the husband and
""
other 
""
""
think that it is the duty  the marriage becomes
successful 
""
""
""
""
atmosphere
""
""
How can that be achieved  first they must understand each
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Well  but the
religious man those who are there  that their lives are
 of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
God
""
""
God
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
disorderly life  they themselves do not know
what they are going to do  going to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
or the husband and wife  uh need not depend upon God or religion all the
""
""
That uh they should 
""
""
And so that  then there will be uh
""
""
""
""
""
