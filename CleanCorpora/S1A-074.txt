I am Mr B N Patil  teaching at the Balasaheb desai college
""
""
""
I am Mr A Y Shinde  lecturer in English
Department of college Patan 
""
""
Well Mr Shinde 
marriage 
""
What are your feelings about 
""
What do you say about 
""
""
About marriages 
""
One is uh  uh uh love
marriage you can say 
""
So modern 
""
And the previous  it was the
arranged marriage 
""
""
Okay you 
""
""
Uh these days people prefer the 
uhm uh other types of marriage 
""
""
But  particularly in
Satara Sangli or Kolhapur district 
""
Is this so  only
""
""
Yes it is a fact 
""
But uh it depends upon the girl 
""
If uh the girl is not very beautiful  uh then they expect more
money
""
They ask for the dowry 
""
And so 
if uh both of them are uh 
there is no question of dowry as such 
""
""
But if there is no question of dowry  then why is that the
people go on demanding more and more from  all of us
""
""
Will you uh in particularly  if you are from a
Marathi 
""
Will you tell me something about  that too
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I know 
""
I am from uh 
""
Uh this here the people have got into the vicious circle 
 to
their 
""
And later on when their boy becomes of a marriagable age  that
time they want the return 
""
And so they demand uh 
""
So that is the problem
""
""
""
""
""
Is it because of the social conditions 
""
""
No
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
What is it then 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Well why is that the dowry system has become  important
nowadays 
""
""
Uh one thing is that  girl's
 and they
want their daughter to be  uh or sent
to another 
""
Then they don't bother about the money
""
 they are ready to give the dowry
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Nowadays  it has a become a problem
""
The dowry has become a problem 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Why why because  uhm
 need Scooter
""
""
Sometimes they demand  or what they
call the Television set and all these things
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
Okay what is the use of the education then 
""
""
No  uh uh there is no self examination or
introspection as such 
""
Uh most of the people are tradition bound  because of
that they go on 
""
""
Well is it the dowry are we going to be  are we going to
""
""
""
Yes  they ask for the
""
""
""
""
uhm that 
""
""
But there is nothing for 
""
What do you say about 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because there is no limit to the 
""
And uh  then the
another party goes on asking  uh the
and something in the form of articles and things
""
""
Well there are some people  who act as mediator
""
""
Yeah  they are called match-makers
""
""
They are called the match-makers
""
""
Match-makers
""
""
Well what are  what are your impressions about these
match-maker
""
How they work 
""
""
""
""
""
 uh interesting role they they
function 
""
Uh  both the
parties
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And  uhm most of the time this match-makers they are
relatives of the  uh one of the parties
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Or sometimes they know the  both the families
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And  uh good work
""
""
Uhm
""
""
It uh 
or community work 
""
They want to help  uhm
 it's
 uh that
both the parties should come together
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And if uh  they uhm
 become very happy
""
And that is why 
 they spent the money on their own
""
""
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
And see to it that both the parties come together 
uhm  they get married
""
The boy and the girl uh get married 
""
""
""
""
""
So  people
or  women chosing their husbands
""
""
Yes
""
""
What is they call 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Okay it differs from  this marriage
that is a marriage system  had the right
 to chose her husband
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is according to her wish
""
What do you say about it 
""
As if  the people
are simply making their daughters obey the orders 
""
""
 uhm the daughters
don't depend mostly upon the uhm 
""
They have also some 
""
That if  uh her
would- be husband  that uh she
doesn't approve of 
""
Hence uh 
the 
""
""
Well is it going to be the marriage of 
or is it going to be the marriage of the economic status of the two families
""
""
""
Well  in arranged marriages it is not the marriage of two
minds 
""
Wherever there is uh  is a
marriage of two minds 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well 
love doesn't cause the way 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Well but now at least  we find people changing their minds
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Taking divorces  again
 taking divorces
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Why is it so 
""
What has happened 
""
What has changed the whole society 
""
""
Uh previously  the marriages are
made in heaven
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And uh uh 
""
They have to remain husband and 
""
But uh so far God has been  uh uh driven away from this world
 nobody believes in
religion as such 
""
And so they think that  uh doesn't make
them happy 
according to their own will 
""
""
Well 
""
""
""
""
""
 one
word 
""
""
The people those who have taken divorce you see them  one
word 
""
""
 a few words
 unsuccessful marriage
""
""
Unsuccess marriage 
""
Uh in  then
""
uhm 
""
Otherwise uh it will affect their children 
""
""
""
""
""
So perhaps 
yeah  going
to happen to their children 
""
""
""
""
""
Now that is the question 
""
Sometimes uh uhm  if the if the matter goes to
the court  of the children
""
""
When the  then they
are uh kept with the mother 
""
And after that  uhm father
""
""
He is free to 
child 
""
""
""
not  the property
""
""
""
""
""
Up to
""
""
What we  call the materialistic
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is to be done about that one 
""
""
You see that is why the court insisted that  uh upto the
age of seven  allowed to be kept with the
mother
""
And after that  the
children 
""
Because it is  uh his responsibility
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And he is also able to  uh bring them up properly or help
them in a materialistic uh 
""
""
 if they have
the law of the land is that we can  divorce
""
So we can live uh independently  that's
""
""
But is it not the duty of the husband  to take proper care of
the  girl
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Uhm 
that his daughter will be safe  in the hands of this
particular person 
""
But it is not observed nowadays 
""
Why so 
""
""
""
""
""
Sir the reason is that  uh the father sometimes he is
unemployed
""
""
Uh
""
""
And uhm  he cannot take
uh the proper care of the 
""
And so he has to keep her in the hostel or some  uh some other
place or with some relatives 
""
And the  the daughter cannot become happy
""
""
No no 
one word  his daughter marries a particular
person
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha I see
""
""
He thinks that he is a right person  who
will take care of my daughter
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But  dreams are shattered
""
""
Yes shattered by
""
""
What does he dream  daughters or father
dream
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The father  of the
""
""
Sir father think that uh  he has made a wrong choice or
his daughter has made a wrong choice 
""
And sometimes say it  uh two family
""
""
Or the  families doesn't
match 
""
And because of that the clash  uh both
the parties 
""
""
For the
""
""
They live uh unhappy 
""
""
Well 
""
""
""
What do you think about it 
""
""
Well the only thing is that  the husband and
wife wants to be in  uh cooperate each
other 
""
They should not  they should
think that it is the duty  the marriage becomes
successful 
""
And they can make conducive or happy atmosphere in the family
""
So that the  they will benefit by that
atmosphere
""
""
How can that be achieved  first they must understand each
other
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Well  but the
religious man those who are there  that their lives are
 of
 uh uhm religious views
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But nowadays it seems that 
""
""
Uhm God
""
""
God
""
""
God
""
""
God as well 
""
Or even they do not uh  believe in themselves what they are
doing exactly 
""
Means the life of the  become uh sort of
disorderly life  they themselves do not know
what they are going to do  going to
 happen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
or the husband and wife  uh need not depend upon God or religion all the
time 
""
That uh they should 
uh for each other 
""
And so that  then there will be uh
no trouble as such
""
""
So it is a love 
""
""
""
""
""
Binding 
""
""
""
""
""
It is a
""
""
Ah ha both the parties can be united 
of their life 
""
""
Okay  about the Maratha families or
what we say  now they are married in uh in some Gujrati
family or the Marwari
