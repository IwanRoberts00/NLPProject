<I>
I am Mr B N Patil teaching at the Balasaheb desai college
 Patan 
I am Mr A Y Shinde uh I'm lecturer in English
Department of college Patan Satara district 
Well Mr Shinde uh nowadays we give importance to 
marriage 
What are your feelings about wedding 
What do you say about 
About marriages marriages can be of two types 
One is uh arranged marriage and another is uh uh love
marriage you can say 
So modern one modern version 
And the previous uh uh in uh bygone days it was the
arranged marriage 
Okay you 
Uh these days people prefer the love marriage or the 
uhm uh other types of marriage where the expenses will be minimum 
But middle class that the people particularly in
Satara Sangli or Kolhapur district mostly they demand dowry 
Is this so uh is it uh a fact or it's only
Yes it is a fact 
But uh it depends upon the girl 
If uh the girl is not very beautiful uh then they expect more
money
They ask for the dowry 
And so if the boy and girl are of uh equal status 
if uh both of them are uh uhm uh they like each other then 
there is no question of dowry as such 
But if there is no question of dowry then why is that the
people go on demanding more and more from all the people all of us
Will you uh in particularly ah if you are from a
Marathi community okay 
Will you tell me something about the community that too
 on the dowry 
 Ah 
 Community 
I know I am from Maratha community 
I am from uh Sangli district 
Uh this here the people have got into the vicious circle 
 uhm in the sense that uh this uh they give them dowry to
their daughters uh while marrying them 
And later on when their boy becomes of a marriagable age that
time they want the return 
And so they demand uh the dowry 
So that is the problem
 Uhm 
Is it because of the social conditions 
No
Yes something else 
Yes 
What is it then 
Uh 
Well why is that the dowry system has become important
nowadays 
Uh one thing is that suppose that girl uh girl's
 father or the parents are rich uhm uh and they
want their daughter to be uh settled in uhm uh or sent
to another uh rich family uhm 
Then they don't bother about the money
 They are ready to they are ready to give the dowry
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 But 
Nowadays it has a become a problem
The dowry has become a problem one word 
Yeah 
Why why because even the educated people uhm
 go on demanding they need Fridge they need Scooter
Sometimes they demand uhm car or what they
call the Television set and all these things
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
Yes
Okay what is the use of the education then 
No that way the uh uh there is no self examination or
introspection as such 
Uh most of the people are tradition bound uh and because of
that they go on uh uh accepting the dowry 
Well is it the dowry are we going to be are we going to
 get everything what you want 
Yes uhm they ask for money and they ask for the
 No it is well it is said uhm 
uhm that nature has everything for man's need 
 uhm 
But there is nothing for man's greed 
What do you say about it 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Yes there is I agree with you 
Because there is no limit to the greed of the man 
And uh if another party can afford to give then the
another party goes on asking for for more and more money and uh the
and something in the form of articles and things
Well there are some people who act as mediator
Yeah they are called match-makers
They are called the match-makers
Match-makers
Well what are what are your impressions about these
match-maker
How they work uhn what they do exactly 
 Uhn 
 It is very uh interesting role they they
function 
Uh uh they knows know both the
parties
Uhm
And uhm most of the time this match-makers they are
relatives of the uh one of the parties
Uhm 
Or sometimes they know the both the families
Uhm
And they take it to be a uh good work
Uhm
It uh you can say it a social work uhm 
or community work uhm 
They want to help in one form or another form uhm
 and uh this marriage uhm uh uhm uh it's
 a tie the holy tie uhm and they want uh that
both the parties should come together
 Uhn 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm
And if uh it becomes fruitful uhm they uhm
 uh they themself themselves become very happy
And that is why uh sometime sometimes 
 they spent the money on their own
 Uhm 
Ah
And see to it that both the parties come together 
uhm and uh they get married
The boy and the girl uh get married 
 Uhm 
So in ancient times we have heard of some people
or wo women chosing their husbands
Yes
What is they call the swayamwara 
Uhm
Okay it differs from yeah this marriage
that is a marriage system uhm means she had the right
 to chose her husband
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
 Haan 
That is according to her wish
What do you say about it 
As if swayamvaras nowadays or the people
are simply making their daughters obey the orders 
 Haan these days uh uhm the daughters
don't depend mostly upon the uhm parents 
They have also some some say in the matter 
That if uh if the daughter doesn't like the boy uh her
would- be husband then she uhm tells the parents that uh she
doesn't approve of that boy 
Hence uh she tells or she is free enough to tell 
the her parents 
Well is it going to be the marriage of uh two minds 
or is it going to be the marriage of the economic status of the two families
Well in arranged marriages it is not the marriage of two
minds yeah 
Wherever there is uh love marriage it is a
marriage of two minds 
 Yeah 
 Uh 
Well it's plenty out there that 
love doesn't cause the way or they can one word 
 Yeah 
Yeah 
Well but now at least we find people changing their minds
Yeah
Taking divorces and uh marrying remarrying again
 taking divorces
 Uhm 
Yeah 
Why is it so 
What has happened 
What has changed the whole society or a few words 
Uh previously uh they thought that the marriages are
made in heaven
Uhm
And uh uh they have to continue this sacred tie 
They have to remain husband and uh wife till the end 
But uh so far God has been uh uh driven away from this world
 nobody uh uhm nobody is afraid of God or nobody believes in
religion as such 
And so they think that uh if that marriage uh doesn't make
them happy then they uhm they take divorce or they behave 
according to their own will 
Well is their life going to be happy in the end or 
 Afterwards 
 What what what are your observations one
word 
The people those who have taken divorce you see them one
word living uh isolated life or 
 Nai see if a few words
 unsuccessful marriage
Unsuccess marriage yes 
Uh in if the husband and wife they are not happy then
 it's better to quit and look uh for another partner 
uhm if they think that uh they will become happy 
Otherwise uh it will affect their children 
 Uhm 
So perhaps if they go away from each other 
yeah and live uhm uhm independent lives so what's going
to happen to their children 
 Yeah 
Now that is the question 
Sometimes uh uhm the court if the if the matter goes to
the court the court can uh uh come to the help of the children
When the uhm children are below seven years then they
are uh kept with the mother 
And after that it's the duty of the uhm father
He is free to uh take the responsibility of the 
child 
 So what the tie means is the love 
not the property
 Yes 
Up to
What we have call the materialistic
Yeah
 It's not the material uhm topic 
 Uhm 
What is to be done about that one 
You see that is why the court insisted that uh upto the
age of seven uhm the child is allowed to be kept with the
mother
And after that uh uhm the father can claim the the
children 
Because it is uh his responsibility
 Uhm 
Yeah
And he is also able to uh bring them up properly or help
them in a materialistic uh one word 
 Well it's so i i if they have
the law of the land is that we can take divorce
So we can live uh independently also that's
 true 
But is it not the duty of the husband to take proper care of
the girl
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
Yeah
Uhm because it is the faith of the father 
that his daughter will be safe yeah in the hands of this
particular person 
But it is not observed nowadays 
Why so 
 Yeah 
Sir the reason is that uh the father sometimes he is
unemployed
Uh
And uhm he has no time and uh he cannot take
uh the proper care of the girl 
And so he has to keep her in the hostel or some uh some other
place or with some relatives 
And the the daughter cannot become happy
No no that's not my question you see 
one word if one word his daughter marries a particular
person
 One word 
Ah ha I see
He thinks that he is a right person uhm who
will take care of my daughter
 Uhm 
Yeah 
But his dreams are shattered
Yes shattered by
What does he dream Whether daughters or father
dream
 Uh 
 Haan 
The father of the
Sir father think that uh he has made a wrong choice or
his daughter has made a wrong choice 
And sometimes say it it happens that the uh two family
 uh backgrounds they don't match 
Or the the culture of uh both the families doesn't
match 
And because of that the clash uh takes place and uh both
the parties get separated 
For the
They live uh unhappy sort of life 
Well what can be done about it 
 What's the solution 
What do you think about it 
Well the only thing is that uh if uh the husband and
wife wants to be in uhm happy then they should uh cooperate each
other 
They should not uh uhm be selfish and uh they should
think that it is the duty to see to that the marriage becomes
successful 
And they can make conducive or happy atmosphere in the family
So that the the children they will benefit by that
atmosphere
How can that be achieved first they must understand each
other
Yeah 
Well that's what we we say but the
religious man those who are there yeah that their lives are
 uh bound by sanctity or by each to each uh by bounds of
 nature or by yeah uh uhm religious views
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Uhm 
But nowadays it seems that the people do not trust 
Uhm God
God
God
God as well 
Or even they do not uh believe in themselves what they are
doing exactly 
Means the life of the people has uh become uh sort of
disorderly life in the sense now they themselves do not know
what they are going to do uhm or what's going to
 no but happen
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
 No but 
 One word depend that her father mother 
or the husband and wife uh need not depend upon God or religion all the
time or tradition all the time 
That uh they should uh uh continue their their affection 
uh for each other 
And so that if they love each other then there will be uh
no trouble as such
So it is a love that is a binding spirit 
 Yeah binding force 
Binding force 
 Or it is a tie 
It is a
Ah ha both the parties can be united uh till the end 
of their life 
Okay so now it's about the Maratha families or
what we say one word now they are married in uh in some Gujrati
family or the Marwari family or some Jain family or some 
one word family yeah what do you say about it 
Hey what what are your observations 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Now as far as marriage from Maratha community are concerned
 most of the marriages are arranged marriages 
Arranged
And uh they i it is uhm long process or long
business you can say
Uhm 
Because uh first of all the match-maker 
plays a very vital role very important role
 Uhm 
Well 
And he sees to it that both the parties come together
Uhm 
And uh there the the girl's father 
 uhm pays a visit to that uh boy's house 
And uh he talks about the marriage 
He gives the invitation you can say
 Uhn 
Okay 
Uh to come to his house uh and see the girl 
one word and that ceremony of showing the girl uhm 
takes place 
And uhm that boy also comes uh and before that uhm
everything is discussed 
And if the boy and uh parents of the boy likes the girl
 then they uh show the green signal 
And uh later on then uh a a formal ceremony takes
place
It is called engagement uh that ceremony
is called engagement 
 One word 
 Uhm 
Well now you talked about this match-maker it's true
then whether th match-maker particularly intents to uhm 
uh contact two families which are 
 Uhm 
 Yeah he knows the fam uh both the
parties
Okay
