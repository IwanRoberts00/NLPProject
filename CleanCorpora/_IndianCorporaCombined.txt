Near the coastal area every yeah time it will

Cyclone blast			
Srikakulam coastal area will come cyclone but uh			
first time Raelsima district

 otherwise rest of the two words can go just goes to waste 			
Why			
Okay we may uh but still something some greasy dish and			
 not bread			
 Let's not serve bread			
 We'll have uh proper chapati 			
 Uhm 			
You can make bhakri na 			
Ah bhakris we'll make no			
problem			
Everyone eats this bhakri 			
Yeah okay we'll have bhakri or 			
we'll have uh chapati whatever 			
And I've asked uh Hemant to get this bot one			
bottle of scotch 			
But now it depends on how many people you'll call 			
If you've got friends like Raj and all then my			
one bottle is not going to suffice			
 Laughs 			
Then decide one bottle of one or two words 			
No we'll buy a good whisky that's no			
problem but uh when we'll serve ordinary whisky			
Okay 			
 Accha what was that uh uh what was			
that Mr Mane telling you that this time when they've sports what			
do they want your help for 			
As a common referee 			
As a to 			
Ah what do you've to do 			
 To 			
Look over the things 			
What things uh 			
What things			
 Uh 			
To know that everything is going properly or not 			
No but for what programme			
Or 			
For sports			
Their inter-school or intership or what 			
 You're talking a few words 			
National style you see 			
Ah okay 			
So inter-school sports when are they normally			
I don't know 			
So he wanted your help 			
So funny you know			
He he's so much faith in your expertise 			
and he he was saying I don't bother you 			
You were saying that you need that qualification was N I			
L and he was saying we don't bother about all such things 			
 Laughs 			
 N I L 			
So anyway but yesterday we had our inspection my god			
so tiring 			
We really had a tough time 			
Uhm you don't have real qualified teachers 			
But you you			
That is the biggest problem in your school 			
You don't get good 			
 Don't talk your teachers are all			
bastard teachers 			
There is no hope 			
You want to have a real good school here 			
You don't get good teachers over here 			
 There is no professional approach towards			
teaching 			
But that really we learnt in Bombay 			
How to be a professional in your jobs 			
 That's it			
Shireen she was excellent at that 			
She was very good 			
She would just you know even even when there was bickering between			
teachers and all that 			
If ever we went to her with our problems ke 			
so and so is you know she used to say just rise above all that 			
Because if you just rise above all that just forget about it 			
You don't be affected by it and don't even try			
to solve it just rise above it			
That means you can't have an understand but 			
you should keep that others you have to solve that problem of with			
management 			
You should not neglect your teaching uh you know			
No but I believe that we people are not 			
 You should be honest with what you're 			
teaching 			
Not just because I'm I A S I'm appointed as a			
teacher I have to go there teach there and teach them for thirty			
thirty-five minutes whatever is in the book you know 			
Most of your teachers are not well prepared 			
 That's true			
They should do the preparation at home			
I feel its for school teaching you know all the people who			
come there half of them are the one who you know haven't been			
able to get in anywhere else so they've come into this profession			
Look being a once you enter the			
class na the teacher doesn't have to open a			
book			
If she is well prepared she doesn't have to open a book			
 Being a 			
 No 			
She can carry on for one hour also without opening a book			
 if she's so thorough 			
 They 			
 And it is not a question of you being			
properly educated and you qualify			
If you're honest with it then you can do it			
And teaching is a knack			
you can be very qualified but you can't communicate 			
You can't have a rapport with the children			
You just can't communicate what you're 			
trying to say 			
 That's true 			
What is B Ed 			
Those teachers are trained to teach 			
 They're trained 			
That gives you very basic outline you know on how to go about			
things 			
That basic line you have the 			
 But that is also but that is also important			
 na how to go about things			
If you don't know how to go about things then what you			
are going to do 			
Uhm that's true			
That's the stupid little boon which government has 			
imposed on everybody 			
And we've a			
So all the management should follow the this guidelines 			
Your problem is known you can get qualified English teachers 			
Our management 			
 Trained English teachers			
English but not English teacher English			
speaking			
 But 			
English speaking			
They all educated through look Marathi medium			
 so we can't we don't have to one-word 			
 Look 			
 You you can get it 			
But then 			
Look if you want the best then you've to give out the			
best also 			
They can			
You know how to 			
Put your hands into your pocket and shell out the money			
We just want teachers teachers teachers don't run			
like that 			
Come on give them proper salaries no 			
No what happens you know they know how to speak English			
but they don't have the colloquial expressions 			
They just you know corrupt they are they talk in very quaint			
uh in a very quaint fashion 			
They were it's not a sort of and they don't have			
vocabulary is so limited that they can't express one thing into two			
other ways also 			
But then you have to use your expressions facial expressions			
to explain things 			
 You've to have a good command over the language			
If you in in an English medium school 			
No that way in a in any language then you should have a			
command			
Yes			
If you want to teach just look 			
Besides doing school work if you're fall falling			
short on that particular language then you've to work on that			
 lang language			
Yeah you've to work at it 			
But then what happens once you get a get set job they're 			
okay			
Then they become a bit uh 			
Uh you've to do your self-improvement 			
How many people really believe in that			
And how many are really ready to do that 			
How is Ajinkya today			
I wonder he got temperature 			
Body is slightly warm 			
What shall we do now his exams are getting over by the end of			
this month 			
Then he is on holiday 			
And I have exams			
So how we're going to sort out that problem 			
One month			
My work is almost getting over			
So when			
By this weekend 			
By this weekend 			
Then you're totally free 			
Uhm hello Ashokji I'm nice here because I'm			
 having nice time in your department 			
 It's really a pleasure to me that I came from a			
distant place Orissa 			
 I'm really having uh the time which usually can't be			
recalled so easily uh when I go back to Orissa 			
I had been to Pandarpur cough last Sunday and uh what			
I saw there is uh a temple of uh Vithalji you know usually the people of			
Maharashtra they call that uhm Vithal Vithal and Rukmani 			
 Vithal Pandurang 			
And one thing I'm surprised to find Vithalji standing			
alone in such a way on a piece of uh brick yeah 			
That that reminds me of the beech you know they call it uh			
surely a brick uh uhm is thrown by the disciple maybe the maybe the person			
who was this Vithal previously and they ordered Vithal to stand on the brick			
 Yeah 			
That is Pundalik Pundalik his devotee			
 Pundalik 			
Yes yes uh exactly 			
I don't know much about the legend			
Yeah 			
But what uh is so surprising there in the temple is that I			
found Rukmani standing alone 			
Vithalji has never given any sort of uh importance to a woman			
called Rukmani 			
No that's not the case			
What happened you know Pundalik yeah that's			
 bhakta of Vithala uhm or Panduranga			
 uhm uhm 			
Panduranga once visited Pundali Pundalika's house			
you know yes and Pundalika was so engrossed and busy 			
 ah ha serving his parents you know yeah yeah			
 and Panduranga as he went there you know uhm 			
Panduranga wanted Pundalika to pay attention to him ah 			
but Pundalika being a very obedient son uhm and very again			
we can say devoted to his uh parents you know he had no time			
 to pay attention to Vithal Vithal so he threw a			
piece of brick you know and made him stand or made him wait there until he			
finishes his service service to his parents			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Yes 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Uhm 			
 Ah 			
 Uhm 			
 Parents 			
 Vithal yeah 			
 The work 			
So that's why that time Rukmani 			
didn't accompany Pundalika did not accompany Panduranga			
 and so Panduranga the Vithal is shown to be alone over there			
 So faithful it seems 			
 Vithalji Vithal yes 			
That is standing on the brick but in other parts of the temple			
you will find Rukmani along with yeah Vithal yes			
yes 			
But for this particular event ah particular			
episode you know Vithala is alone over there because he alone visited 			
 Pundalika's house			
 Yeah 			
 yes yes 			
 Ah 			
But there I found you know uhm the feminine			
power is hot there when I'm being a female yeah I			
found uh Vithal is selfish enough not to allow Rukmani proper position			
 yeah 			
I found desciples making long line yeah to visit			
Vithal whereas nobody was here before the temple of Rukmani 			
So it shocked me really			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
No			
The same thing you know the same thing had happened in Orissa			
also yeah 			
 We've the Jagannath temple in Puri 			
Shrikhetra yeah which usually call it 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah Puri 			
 Yeah 			
$A>			
And uh whenever Jagannath which is brought there			
Balabhadra comes out in the cart festival ah we found that			
uh both of them both the brothers they accompany uhm their sister			
Subhadra uhm and on the other hand we find Laxmi uhm			
stays alone inside the temple 			
 Ah 			
 Uhm 			
So really I found gods in general they become selfish when			
 uh they find uh the importance of the disciples must be given			
to the gods 			
But we've also temples called Mahalaxmi temple 			
 yeah in our Sambalpuri yeah we've 			
Samleshwari mandir and where usually we find godesses are			
worshipped 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah now and uh what happens 			
 haan if it happens to be a temple of Panduranga mainly			
 yeah so it's very natural that focus is on			
Panduranga when it's a temple of Mahalaxmi uhm you			
find Mahalaxmi only there not her husband that is in Tirupati			
 And uh 			
 Haan 			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
Tirupati is supposed to be her husband you know			
 yes but nowhere you find his shrine in the temple 			
 uhm that is Tirupati shrine in the temple			
 Her husband 			
 Yes 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
So it is not a kind of injustice or just subordinating the			
role of a woman or so 			
These gods and goddesses you know uhm so once it is			
a temple of Mahalaxmi Mahalaxmi has to be in focus			
 Uhm 			
Yes yes			
When it is temple of Panduranga or the Vithala Vithala has to			
be in focus			
Okay it depends upon the name name			
 It depends on 			
Jagannath temple so Jagannath they are no Laxmi			
 Jagannath 			
And in those days you know there was nothing like feminism			
Yeah laughter of course you're right so			
If I bring in that kind of interpretation over here			
 Laughs that's right			
 You've really I'm sorry in a very good way 			
you've convinced me and uh I found the climate of 			
Maharashtra is very good people are nice soft spoken well behaved and uh 			
exactly like the Oriya people 			
The dishes are also uh quite similar to the yeah			
 dishes of Orissa and the system you know the culture the			
culture differs a little bit I think			
 Yeah 			
Oh it has to differ you know 			
But as you say that is uh dishes that is food staple food 			
 uhm so staple food in Oriya must be uh I mean different			
from the staple food we've in Maharashtra			
 Uhm 			
Yeah yeah			
Because in Maharashtra normally we've a 			
chapati or			
 Chapati then			
 Bhakri we say			
 Bhakri 			
 Jowari 			
Yes yes			
 Bhakri made up of jowari			
 			
 Made up of jowari 			
So we don't have that 			
We know certainly you don't have because 			
 it is 			
 So I found 			
Actually I found much difficulty in swallowing jowari			
 that means that bhakri what you			
call bhakri 			
 Bhakri 			
 Bhakri because it's not a very			
crisp and uh yeah what you say delicate 			
delicate and very soft you know but when it is fresh 			
but when it is hot and fresh you know yeah you really			
relish it relish			
 Yeah 			
 Delicate 			
 But I like chapati 			
 Yeah 			
But chapatis you know it's a common			
food all over India even all over the world you know it's common			
 yeah yeah 			
You get wheat everywhere 			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Everywhere you can get it lekin			
chapati na it is sufficient to supply that much of energy to			
human body 			
And uh so far the department is concerned I found all the			
professors and teachers sounding of bells they are quite uh 			
you know serious about the teaching 			
Yes sounding of bells in the university 			
 Yes in your your department you're the			
student of this department you know much better than myself cough			
But within this few one word days of my staying in 			
uh Kolhapur in the hostel ladies hostel			
 Kolhapur 			
I found uh that the coordinator is really uhm an an			
enthusiastic boss to encourage hostel life anything			
No basically all of them are first they all of them are			
 human and humane uhm both very kind soft spoken and			
you know that uh kind of hospitality that all of us share here 			
 That's unique you might say haa because			
you never			
 Uhm 			
 Naturally 			
Naturally I was			
Because hardly you know any outsider finds it difficult			
here to stay atleast on the campus you know yeah 			
Because as far as possible because we've our			
limitations in a way uhm because office looks after			
 all these things you know			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
 Haan 			
So whatever office provides or offers ah 			
the same thing we extend to the participants also 			
But we see that not much inconvenience is done to the 			
 participants so that's always there			
 Ah 			
 Participants 			
Or not only the professors or lecturers who are working			
here but uh office assistant also yeah along with			
the peons you know yeah and that Mr Chavan and uh Mr			
Bhonsle yeah all of them are quite cordial			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
And uhm so far you two I've heard much about Dr			
Shastri from you since you were a very student of Dr Shastri 			
uhm but I haven't seen him with my eyes 			
 Uhm 			
 No we we can do we can do one thing 			
 yeah not today uhm but tomorrow or day after 			
 uhm we can go to his place 			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Oh it's uh			
Because I just one mention I just mentioned			
once yesterday only yeah 			
Because when after the session was over yes 			
yesterday I went to his place			
 I'm eagerly 			
 Yeah 			
 Yes 			
Yes I would like to see him and your wife also			
specially because I'll take an interview of your wife laughs			
 So 			
Why she chos she has chosen the life of a housewife			
Oh I see			
Because since I gave a paper on feminine power 			
yeah uh that I will I must reinvigorate her mind			
 Yeah 			
But she does exert her power at home laughter 			
feminine power I mean that she does have 			
 It's not sufficient you know 			
 We're born to serve others yeah 			
Not a single man a husband all family members all of us			
 have got some responsibility for the society 			
 Yeah 			
 Now I believe in I give you one example here			
Uhm			
Just one and a half months ago uhm I had my			
aunty with us uhm my aunty who is above seventy-five			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah you're a Maharashtrian no			
Yeah uh and who's above seventy-five 			
 uhm and some six or seven months back yeah 			
she uh got an attack of paralysis my god 			
She did just fell down in then in a one word			
 then she was rushed to the hospital near Karad uhm 			
and then I got the message uhm as her uh condition			
is very serious or she is very serious			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 My God 			
 Then 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Then I uhm went to Karad uhm			
Thereafter next day I took my all the members 			
uhm of my family and we went there 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
She was there in the hospital for eight nine days 			
Nine days			
Thereafter she was discharged she was given discharge			
Uh how is she now			
She is now is alright			
Now I uh brought her here yeah 			
She stayed with us			
 Yeah 			
Ah in your house			
Yes in my house she stayed with us for five months 			
 uh ha 			
So we two together me and my wife			
 Uh ha 			
Now you're taking care of her now			
Not only to care you no uhm she was it			
was impossible for her to walk to move everything but			
since			
 Uhm 			
 To move 			
So she is very much engaged your wife is yeah			
 very much engaged in the house-hold activities 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah she is engaged 			
If she were working if my wife 			
 Uhm and then so much of attention you would not			
have taken			
Yeah now she my aunty would not have been able to walk			
again uhm 			
She would not have been able to walk again 			
 Uhm 			
 Haan but uh			
So it is not a question of working outside uhm			
 It's a question of serving serve you			
say though yeah serving the old people			
 Uhm 			
 Serve 			
 Yeah 			
Yes yes don't think			
So that's where you know			
Yes			
So what you gain by serving outside maybe you get returns			
in terms of say rupees or moneys you know			
 			
But this kind of achievement uhm is not possible			
outside			
 Ah ha 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm some satisfaction 			
No if somebody works outside ah somebody			
needs to be there yeah to look after the house			
Maybe husband maybe children maybe that is there 			
 Ah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah some someone 			
Someone must be there			
So your opinion I I do respect uhm but			
when 			
 Uhm 			
But I'm not talking in terms of money you know 			
 I'm not talking in terms of money 			
 Not not money 			
But if you have somebody at home yes to			
 look after the you know house hold affairs you know 			
then you know it's very uh it's quite right 			
 uhm that one should go out and work you know			
 Yes 			
 Ah yes sure sure 			
 Uhm 			
But if there is nobody to look after in the house you know			
 uhm why 			
You should give the priorities uhm and you			
should			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Yes in fixing of one's priority 			
 In fixing of priority and you should think that			
at what expense yeah you would work outside			
 Yeah 			
Uhm uhm but we modern women women are very much confused 			
 yeah so far fixing the priorities are concerned 			
 Yeah 			
 But at what expense			
 That's what I say you know 			
If you think that well she is uh ill I'll			
 she can't walk 			
 I'll 			
 She is old and say 			
 Let her let her occupy one corner 			
uh 			
Let me do my other duties you know			
 Uh 			
 Sure 			
Ah			
So that's not humane			
 You're doing a very pious duty you know			
 don't think that it will be wasted yeah 			
You will get it returned			
 That's not human 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah that's right			
In this hour something in your this in this life also you			
suffer			
So it is the priority yeah 			
What you value more			
 Yeah 			
Yeah human love affection 			
 Affection money			
But that one word is also doing the work of			
 humanism			
 Money money 			
Even the money is necessary uhm uhm it is 			
instrumental and secondary 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm			
 That's what I think			
 I've two children 			
These two children if my wife goes out and say teaches 			
 uhm other children or if 			
 Uhm 			
 Other children they would be neglected			
They would be neglected			
So what is the use of your earning			
Uh na 			
One thing is I can advise Ashokji that you can engage your			
wife after the children become one word 			
 That's fine because you know 			
 efficient she has done M A in English			
 Efficient 			
Yeah			
She has done 			
 It's nice she she has done			
 M A in English			
 She has done 			
Yeah she has done her B Ed and that too after we got			
married 			
Uh hello Basu 			
How are you			
Uhm hello 			
Chakraborti how are you			
 I'm fine			
Uh you for the last uh ten to fifteen days for the last ten			
fifteen days we are going to have a uh new political uh the			
transformation both in the State and the Centre			
What is your opinion			
What you think about it 			
Actually mm what I think is uhm that uh I was			
reading a newspaper today in the morning and uh I found that uh			
 some uh some foreigners commented that it is uh why the			
people of India are crying uh or crying about the possibility 			
of the future democratic			
It is that means it is why they are crying so much about			
the about the uh existence of democracy in India 			
This is this is their comment and I think that uh okay if it			
happens like that uh and uh this uh formation of government which			
 because it is a democracy so so many parties are there 			
So if it is uh uhm most of the uh parties			
they if they join together I think the country will run well 			
 Don't you think Basu in your home in Japan in 			
Israel even in uh Sri Lanka in these countries uh there are			
many governments which are formed uh by many parties 			
Single party uh is ruling the country like India			
This type of thing is very rare particularly in this decade and			
if that be so if Japan can have a government formed by man by			
many parties say three or four parties			
Israel has got a government recently and that government is			
formed by three parties			
France in Europe France France has uh got uh uh so in the			
government Fre Fre French government you find that a Communists or			
Socialists have have joined 			
Mitterand has got one uh ca cabinet colleague who			
belongs to the radical party or that communist party			
Naturally if Mitterand President Mitterand can run his government			
for a period of ten years uh why In India cannot have a			
government consisting of some uh party uh national party national			
party representing the national capital or some progressive elements uh			
uh in some some political parties like Congress-I Congress-S or even			
Janata Dal with some uh radical members belonging to uh			
communist party or socialist party 			
Why we ca we can have a very beautiful government very			
viable government very feasible government in our country			
Uh and the government and the and the composition of that			
government can be uh say uh some members belong to Congress-I some			
members belong to C PI-M some members belong to Janata Dal but all these			
elements should be progressive 			
So in that way we can form a government			
What is your opinion			
I as I think uh that uh the people of India are not			
very used to this this kind of situation because uh in the in the past			
they had not uh this kind of I mean the long past 			
Only only one party uh uh ruled the our country 			
one party 			
But now it is the something different 			
It is different means uh because that is why I I say that 			
because of we are not used to that because we are traditionally 			
and we think that uh only if there is only one party then uh			
this uh our country will progress and if so many parties come			
together uh there is a ideological differences 			
So naturally there will be clash and uhm our democracy 			
would wouldn't be able to survive			
This is the this is the fear this is the fear			
I I'm not very much uhm I'm not very much			
 sure whether uh this government is going to survive 			
uhm 			
But uh let us see that is 			
 Uhm 			
Okay Basu 			
Just think what I what I want to say 			
First of all the people of India of the sixtees or the			
seventees were not adequately exposed to the West 			
One of the reasons of Indian people's exposure to the West			
is undoubtedly television and the proximity between Indian people and			
the western people uh which has been made through different types of			
exchange			
Political exchange uh tourist exchange tourist exchange or			
scholars exchange of scholars or ex exchange of technocrats			
So west is not at present times totally alien to us 			
I think there is a kind of close proximity between the west			
and the east 			
Naturally if the governments in those countries are viable 			
first of all if that gover if those governments in Europe and			
Japan and in Is Israel even in Sri Lanka if those			
governments are viable or can run smoothly uh we also can have a			
government of that type			
When the so called national party Congress-I has disintegrated			
 uh itself into different segments 			
First of all Congress-I has no power of of what do you think			
Do you think that India is basically has got one culture			
Or do you believe that India has got an unity in diversity 			
Or if you don't believe it don't you think that			
this is a concept which has been imposed by the British upon the Indians 			
India in the ancient past was not together 			
India in the even in the Muslim period India is not was not			
 one was not a one country 			
India became one and united during this time of the British 			
Naturally British united India for the sake of the smooth			
administration 			
Now we are running after the same cultural uh identity 			
We are running after that that uh that same cultural identity			
I I I don't say that India should be disintegrated			
No not that			
But cultural uh I mean uh India has got a a heterogeneous			
culture 			
Heterogeneous national entity and for the sake of the interest			
of all the communities belonging to different cultures should all			
the communities should live together peacefully 			
I mean it is a mutual interest and Congress-I cannot offer us			
at present a a a a cannot ca cannot present us a viable			
government with the help of which it can rule the whole of the country			
What is your opinion about the cultural entity of our			
nation 			
 What's your opinion what do you say			
Uhm now now see Chakraborti it is uh the proverb goes			
like that that uhm too many cooks spoil the broth 			
Uh this is a proverb and I think that in the present			
situation uh this proverb uh can go well 			
But still uhm though I don't stick to this kind of			
proverb because uh yes I do agree with you 			
Sometimes uhm the people uh sorry people of India			
 they are they belong to different communities and they have			
their separate cultures 			
Naturally every nation has as India has a particular culture			
Japan has a particular culture British has a particular culture uh America			
has got a American people have got their own culture			
So there is there is a cultural dissimilarity 			
Yeah yes uh a separate culture means uh within the country			
 not so vast uh the variations the variety			
 I'm talking about the variety 			
Variety in Indian culture is something uh something which you			
 don't find in uh the western countries 			
Uh particularly in European			
In what sense do you think that			
 Let's suppose our we are Bengalis and uh some			
 there are some other states where some other uh communities			
live and there is a there is a cultural difference 			
 Don't you think that it is the religion which can			
unite all the people belonging to different cultures 			
No I don't think that uhm because religion			
is something uhm something which uh should uhm ennoble the			
mind of a person 			
It it it goes like that but you see in our India religion			
is something which is uh manipulated in some in order to			
gain something 			
You are putting some aspersions on religion or those religious			
 reli religious leaders who uh uh who try to use their			
religion 			
Actually frankly speaking I don't believe in the 			
in any kind of religion because religion only means when I say that I			
am a Hindu and you are a Muslim or he is a uh Buddhist like that that			
 separates us us that creates a wall between us 			
Only the religion is uh the humanism 			
Humanism is our religion 			
Humanity so uh I think that only this should exist 			
Nothing else 			
So so you have come to the same point again that India is			
a country in which peoples of different cultures people of uh			
divergent states are living together should live together in the			
years to come atleast in the thousand years to come for the interest			
of all 			
So how can you expect that one particular political party say			
Congress-I should rule or can rule such a big country with vast 			
uh number of pa pa I mean with a vast population belonging			
to different cultural entities			
How can you think			
I can't make out this thing			
How can you think a political party like Congress-I should rule 			
for our country because he is a single cook and you don't 			
allow other cooks to work together 			
I think if all the cooks are invited and the taste will be			
miscellaneous divergent and as the pople in India are of divergent			
qualities divergent traits and characters these dishes which will			
be prepared by different cooks will be palatable to all 			
So you must you too at if I accept your one word 			
then also we can arrive at a conclusion that we should have different			
cooks in New Delhi 			
 What's your opinion 			
Yes that is uh okay 			
That is very right			
That uh in the present situation we don't have any			
other alternative 			
We must have to invite uh so many cooks uh so that uh our			
country will so that our country survives and uh it can prosper			
Uh it can prosper uh otherwise uh our country is uh you			
know that it is going through a very uh critical time and uh in			
order to survive that we must join our our hands together 			
Otherwise uh we are going to face a bit difficult situation in			
future so			
What type of difficult situation you anticipate			
If this government fails in the months to come say two or two			
three months			
After two months if this government or or say after three months if			
this government fails what type of uh what type of apprehensions			
 what type of misgivings you think you anticipate 			
I think that uh in different parts of India uh you			
know that uh about Punjab and uh Assam 			
Oh it was also during that uh Punjab problem was very much 			
uh the living dur even during the time of Mrs Indira Gandhi			
Uh Assam problem of Assam was also a very burning problem			
Burning one during the time of Mrs Indira Gandhi 			
So these problems are new to us almost due due to			
mishandling of some political leaders uh these handlings these			
problems have transformed themselves into something ethnic problem 			
So these problems are not new 			
These problems are very common to us we are habituated			
We are accustomed to these problems 			
Yes we are accustomed but uh see that if uh uh Punjab was			
the first then Assam came 			
And we know that uh there are uh suppressed uh supressed 			
anger in uh different parts of India			
We know that 			
So that exact due to the uh is the is that due to the lopsided			
growth or uneven growth of uh uneven growth of particular regions at			
the cost of others 			
Do you think so			
I think uh that is very much true that sometimes uh uh			
that government uh just intentionally they say that Bihar is a			
very uh backward because the people of Bihar are very uh idle 			
and uh very uh they don't work at all 			
And so they uhm they uhm they uh this state will not 			
develop 			
And if it happens like that uh in the allocation of money			
 if it happens like that then naturally the people of Bihar is going			
to revolt against this type of uh uh behaviour			
So you think that mismanagement financial mismanagement			
management financial mismanagement of the Central government is one of their			
important reasons for uh this lopsided uneven growth economic growth			
in our country and one region is uh being developed at the cost of other			
regions			
Naturally the region which is lagging behind the regions uh			
like eastern regions			
Uh people living in the eastern regions are lagging behind and			
they are harbouring a kind of discontentment resulting in a kind of political			
or ethnic crisis or sometimes in secessionist movements 			
Mr Yadav I think we should discuss about Premchand and his 			
workmanship regarding in the literature			
How do you think like that			
Yes what is your opinion about Premchand say art in			
technique 			
Premchand the greatest of uh Hindi novelist 			
As far as his craftmanship is concerned I think he is the front rank			
 front ranker 			
Front ranker what do you mean by this front ranker 			
Uh with the development of Hindi literature particularly in the			
genre of novel I think Premchand initiated the novel form in its			
presant context and proper form 			
So he should be considered as the front ranker 			
Front ranker			
Front ranker 			
Because by the word front ranker I do suppose that Premchand			
initiated the novel form in its true contexts 			
It its exact form 			
Then by the word novel we suppose a such detail type of prose story			
and prose composition which can contain a large theme in its full detail			
charaterisation and everything else			
Premchand utilises novel form in the in this context 			
So he should be considered as a front ranker 			
I think Premchand is a novelist of 			
 You're you're considering about the quality			
or the class of Premchand as a novelist 			
No I just uh want to emphasise this about Premchand as			
a novelist particularly about his characters characters 			
 Characters 			
What kind of characters he put in his novel			
Oh yeah that is a very fine thing 			
I think Premchand is primarily dealing with the characters related			
to the rural life of India			
He is always depicting the rural picture of countryside and the			
villages in India particularly in the pre-Independence era and also 			
about the Independence era 			
Uh by this word pre-Independence I do mean that uh the			
characters which do occur in the novels of Premchand like 			
 Godan and some other novels like 			
 Gaban and say all these novels			
 there are lots of characters who just represent the different aspects			
 different uh see the different colours and different categories			
of the characters which are which uh are represented by our 			
rural society as well class			
 I feel I feel 			
 I one word 			
I think Premchand's characters are very simple			
Yeah no doubt 			
 They are very innocent			
No doubt			
They come from low status of life uh from villages 			
they are living standard is very low yes and they are			
actually exploited by the aristocrat classes 			
 Yes 			
Because you see Premchand was a true novelist in its sense			
He just painted rural pictures in its real serial colour without			
any artificial ornamentation			
Premchand has represented rural society in its essence true			
essence for example you see lots of farmers while toiling hard and			
and reeling under odd type of atrocities and all type of I mean			
exploitation at the hands of our feudal society and feudal bureaucratic set			
up			
He has represented them all 			
Poverty is lying there all glaring poverty under the repressive			
rules of taxes			
All type of taxes being levied by the aristocratic and ruling set			
up			
These are all glaring and all visible clearly visible it is 			
 I think so 			
 I think his characters are tragic such			
as uh we can take for example in Gaban 			
 Gaban certainly			
Uh Ramanath he is a steady character 			
though I think he is an escapist yes 			
He leaves the hard realities of life he runs away he and he			
 doesn't show the he doesn't reveal the reality			
 Ramanath 			
 Yes 			
He just manipulates something 			
 I think in Gaban the			
novel 			
He does something but he says something			
So there is no unification in his deed and speech			
I think uh the novel Gaban 			
which uh shot up the popularity of Premchand as a novelist too much			
I think there is a psychological introspection into the			
characters one word of Ramanath the character who has been affronted			
by so many pecularities of his fate 			
He is driven to Calcutta			
He goes there			
He uh joins a very low middle class family there			
He one day goes and wins a a chess uh quiz and he is			
able to get some prize			
In his cheerly he was fascinated for buying so many ornaments to			
his uh jewelleries to his wife 			
 Can you tell me 			
Can you tell me please how does he come to the real point			
Ramanath Ramanath realises ultimately			
What does he realises ultimately			
Ramanath ultimately did realise that his fascination and his			
over expense o on the items of uh high valued jewelleries			
costly jewelleries was not a real thing			
It did create lot of problems for him he had leave his flee			
away from his home town Lucknow and he was forced to go to Calcutta			
And there amidst lots of tragic situations and grim realities			
 he come to this conclusion that we cannot move or flee away from the			
hard realities which uh are the pre-dominence realities of life and			
society			
I think something like that 			
What do you think uh about his art and technique 			
 Premchand's 			
Yes 			
As art technique Premchand has used the picturised			
pictures card I think			
Premchand always 			
 Pictures 			
Uh uh by pictures I mean that Premchand always uh			
puts before his readers or presents before his his readers of his			
novels a true and lively and faithful picture of the surrounding or the			
locale he is going to put in his novel			
For example if he tries to mention a village then he starts			
about picturising all the minute details			
For example the roads full of dust			
For example the pond full of hycinth and all even men and women			
are bathing there and even cattles and animals are also there and			
somebody is washing his utensils and somebody is washing his clothes			
So this type of lively picturise then gives you a very healthy			
and lively informatives he used to give yes regarding his			
location			
 Yes 			
 You're you're you're very			
correct 			
His description is really very minute and clear when we read			
And very live lively			
 Haan lively			
Yes but what do you think about the language which he			
uses in his novels 			
Uhm in terms of lang uh language I think Premchand			
should be considered as a true artist in the sense he never goes for			
artificial or ornamental language 			
He always picks up the words from our local dialects 			
Or even the word he use suggest a kind of our naturality			
Suppose for example he always uses such type of dialogues which are			
actually spoken by the native people in the remote village side			
I think like that			
 Yes 			
And that gives a kind of naturality and directness to the			
expression their livility and anything else			
Yes you are very correct 			
Really his languauage is very simple direct and very very			
communicative 			
Even his language is so simple that it is not difficult to			
understand even a very uneducated person also can be able to			
understand and can able can be able to enjoy his novel			
One thing one one word I I do feel that the			
language Premchand uses in his novels do present such categories and such			
classes in our society			
For example for the people belonging to lowest strata of			
society Premchand uses the exact dialogue used by them			
Yes very good very correct 			
 And for example people belonging to suppose			
suppose middle class or the upper middle class or the uh or the upper			
class elite class gentry he uses that type of uh I mean the standard			
dialect which has some real touches and everything etiquette and manner			
all things that are possible			
For example a feudal chief a zamindar talking			
to his uh kinsmen and talking to his uh I mean servants he uses			
there is a kind of two kinds of uh language there			
The language used by the zamindar or the feudal			
chief is something high something bombastic something one word 			
and something high sounding but the language used by the servant is something			
quitely different and there you come across a kind of representation of the			
society in terms of the variation of the language itself			
I think it is also a peculiar aspect			
A a distinct achievement of Premchand as a craftmanship			
regarding his novels being in the terms of use of languages of 			
uhm do you think like that yes 			
Alright is it okay			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
Now I would like to discuss about uh uh 			
Premchands pictorial uses of language 			
He uses pictorial languages also			
He is his language is poetic very poetic 			
Yes it is 			
So one word 			
 I'll show you some examples Mr			
Yadav 			
 Haan 			
For Premchand makes fine or rather far fetched use of			
 miseries and phrases			
Phrases to communicate uh great ideas			
Very direct ideas for example uh in a beautiful short story			
 Kafan Kafan dealing with the 			
tragic aspects of the li lives of a father and his son 			
Premchand shows how the daughter-in-law of a man is dying 			
How due to her pregnancy			
And both son and father father-in-law both are so lazy			
that they have just didn't care			
They didn't care to their daughter-in-law and she is			
dying			
And which Premchand has shown in this way that uh while			
the daughter-in-law is just on her on her death-bed crying up			
mercilesly 			
And at the same time son and father-in-law are sleeping in deep			
slumber as if two azgars are sleeping 			
So there the tongue two azgars do indicates such			
a kind of pictorial touch and there lies the brilliance of use of			
language in its pictorial manifestation			
I think something like that			
 Yes 			
Yes correct			
And you come across uh so many I mean numberless			
examination of such things			
And pictorial aspect has been superbly illustrated by			
Premchand in his novels and particularly in his short stories			
For example you see in Panch Parmeshwar			
 also there is brilliant example of this pictorial			
A representation and picturisation of uh khala			
 and mausi for human's sake 			
There is also uh her curly and white hairs and her cheeks 			
uh swollen something like that			
Yes that's true			
Here you also come across some picturisation aspect			
Yeah that's true			
His his ideas are also very thoughtful			
 If it is deep idea so simple			
language in a very simple say 			
 Yes no no doubt 			
 Yes 			
 For example you come across uh so many			
examples Premchands original views on poverty honesty friendship 			
these are the ideas India's age old tradition			
In India the age old views on friendship trust cooperation			
friendship all aspects have been yes dealt by Premchand in			
different context and situations and that and those expressions			
enable Premchand to outlet and vent his ideas in a very just stable and			
very convincing manner			
I think so			
 Yes 			
You are very correct			
Now I would like to talk about his satirical aspect 			
I think Premchand is a great satirist because he			
exposes some foibles shortcomings weaknesses of the society 			
 Because 			
So for example you see in Gaban			
 			
Yes			
He exposes all the short comings of the society			
All the happening a real happening of the society			
Yes satire as uh the great satirist 			
 He is a great satirist			
Yes yes			
Satire as a great satirist and classical John Ryder has said			
 satire as the amendment of vices by correction 			
I think Premchand also in his uh all through his			
literary career followed this dictum 			
 Premchand's satirical purpose in his novels or short			
stories wants to recorrect society 			
To recorrect it if there are certain anomalies in society 			
there are some waywardness in society there are some inherent defect 			
So Premchand used his aesthetic features of literary literary			
art to expose those irregularities which are prevelent in our society and			
by his critical comments he tried to enlighten the people and be aware 			
towards all these irregularities and if possible try to remove them			
So that our society be such a place that we would like to be			
living 			
I think so			
Premchand has always attacked on the exact causes of our			
poverty exact causes of our illiteracy exact causes of of unawareness			
regarding all the grim realities and grim difficulties that our society face			
these days 			
Particularly one must remember that Premchand was writing uh			
uh uh Premchand wrote all his novels and short stories in the			
pre-Independence era when India was not free and it was under the clutches of			
British monarchy			
All type of oppression were being carried on in the name			
of British Queen after a pro proclamation of eighteen fifty-eight			
So Premchand being a one word artist was always awake 			
to see what our society is			
What are its chief defects			
And he always used the literary art to work as a st 			
as an a stimulus to awaken the people from their deep slumber and			
subconscious state to see the gruelling aspect of society 			
 I'm Madhumita from Gowahati and you want

So uh we prefer more on makke ki roti and			
 sarson ka sag laughter 			
 Sarson ka sag 			
Yeah it should be very much sarson ka sag 			
 I'm very fond of it 			
Just uh this what you call that leaves and you know all 			
 mustard leaves that mustard leaves			
 Mustard leaves 			
We first of all we wash it then we cut and uh 			
Into small			
Into small pieces very small pieces 			
And then at least in my house like we have got a choola			
 			
 We've got a uhm angeethi what you			
call			
Yes			
So in that there is uh earthen pot and in that we put			
In the morning we ca we I mean we put some water in it			
and in the afternoon it becomes very much well mashed up well prepared			
Then we put all those coriander and something uh 			
 tomato tomato and everything all the masalas we put			
It becomes very tasty			
 Tomato 			
But the main thing is we stress upon butter and desi			
ghee 			
 Desi ghee 			
Do you add a bit of flour later ?			
Yeah 			
You keep some basen of			
No haan we put some basen 			
 Basen and that makes it much tasty			
Tasty 			
Tasty to have to eat			
Tasty that in many punjabi family staying near we get it			
But then somehow I can't prepare it			
 It's the burning as per the initials			
Even you can't do it in a pressure cooker ?			
No we can do it in a pressure cooker			
But it won't be that tasty 			
Actually that family it's my family is traditional			
So I've got my old grandmother and making for us you know			
So like if we have to make we'll naturally prefer a 			
 pressure cooker 			
 Pressure cooker you boil the saag			
 ?			
Yeah we boil the saag 			
Then you fry it 			
Uh not nothing to fry just to put desi ghee			
 and all those			
After that cook it for some time			
 Haan onion we pre make it red			
Then put some haldi powder and some little bit of			
chilli as per the taste 			
Then we put that masala into the mustard 			
You put tomatoes also in it ?			
 Haan tomatoes also 			
It gives taste even tomatoes			
But what you like eating ?			
 It's uh I mean fish laughter 			
 We'll have it in uh I mean it's a kind of			
essential for both the lunch and uh 			
 Yes that's it is you feel like uh 			
Lunch and dinner you take 			
 Yeah both even the chapatis 			
when we've got			
 Accha 			
Fried fish 			
Fried fish 			
So we have fish we have to have it			
Uhm			
Plenty of fish			
Plenty of fish			
If we don't eat fish we feel very we haven't eaten any			
thing 			
 We haven't eaten any thing 			
And you know it price is not the thing you know it			
can go upto seventy eighty a kg and even then you've it 			
On every occasion you have to have fish 			
How do you you have kaliya 			
 Kaliya I mean it's a very tasty			
fish			
You put some curd also making a fish ?			
Yes			
Curd and cream also			
Yes sometimes 			
That depends upon the dish you're preparing			
Yeah 			
If you want to make a fried fish what you do			
You just fry it 			
 Fry it in mustard oil			
Mustard oil			
We use mustard oil for fish preparation I mean even the newer			
generation which is using uh refined oil uhm it uses mustard oil for the			
 fish preparation			
You can use refined oil for whatever 			
Yes you know refined you know postman or			
 saffola whatever you use its of no use 			
No			
 It won't allow the taste to come through 			
 It won't allow the taste to come through 			
The taste it is very flavour but they say you've lot			
of cholestrol there 			
 Mustard oil 			
 Mustard oil 			
But fish in itself doesn't contain as much as cholestrol as a			
egg or meat 			
And I think you must be frying in uh this iron 			
kadai 			
Yeah kadai yes			
Iron one or			
Iron one hi 			
Or the brass ?			
Better Iron one is better because it doesn't stick to the			
Stick to it			
And those uh non stick things if you don't have because			
They don't have a rounded base			
 Na they're shal 			
shallow base 			
So there should be plenty of			
 So that uh 			
Then uh then you just fry it and then what you do ?			
First we I mean wash cut and wash the fishes and then we			
put some uh salt and haldi uhm in it 			
and leave it to marinate say for about five or ten minutes 			
uhm and then we fry it deep fry it more or less in oil			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
And I mean the most common preparation is with uh			
grounded mustard 			
We fry the fish and then we grind the mustard put 			
haldi water and green chillies and put into the 			
kadai along with the fish and salt to taste and			
 that's all			
 One word 			
I mean that is the easiest way			
And you can even steam it			
Steam it with the ingredients			
 Hilsa 			
 Hilsa you do it			
 It's like you put in if you don't you know you can			
put in the pressure if you want it separated and get 			
 It's all means you don't cook the heat or just			
Because the Hilsa itself is a very I mean easily			
cooked fish 			
And I mean we prefer sweet water fish to sea fish			
Sea fish			
Yes we don't eat the sea fish 			
 It's only occasionally when it comes in the			
market			
 Occasionally 			
Especially in winter 			
That too we go for prawns			
Prawns			
 Haan you get the prawns			
Don't like prawns 			
No laughs 			
 I've never seen anybody taking that in my family 			
Yes of course you know people they when they talk of			
prawns you know when			
See you know we people are so considerate that we take			
 alu ke parathe and gobi ke parathe and			
 sarso ka saag makke ki roti we're much more			
concentrated on these type of foods you know 			
Regarding non-veg we take that meat and chicken 			
and all that 			
But atleast I don't take			
 Biryani 			
Have you tried uh taking fish in uh			
In the Oven ?			
Yeah			
No I haven't			
Have you ?			
Yes uh I prefer it more you know that means you have to			
have less of oil			
Any fish ?			
Any fish			
No we get this you know			
I don't know what you call it this side 			
 We've the names of uh supposed to call what do you			
call it			
Uh no			
We have we call it semi putthi and we have			
different putthi semi putthi			
 and it's very sweet			
 Putthi 			
 Semi means sugar and then we just			
marinate it with lemon or something and all			
Keep it for sometime then I usually make a sauce 			
 Yeah 			
Sauce ?			
Maybe a cheese sauce and get into a egg white sauce			
with egg 			
And you don't need to do it			
Sometimes I just just fry a bit slightly and then put			
you know I just put into a tomato sauce and onion then ginger and			
garlic and big chillies or capsicum whatever you've 			
Then you just give a topping you give uh cheese 			
 Ginger and garlic 			
So that cheese melts and one word 			
 I've uh actually I've got			
this griller also in my gas stove 			
So the easiest way you put it inside and then you are studying			
you don't have to fry it it takes time then I make the fish uh one or

 Like we say baijo

Kunwar Ji or sa 			
 It's like ha sa ha means

Yeah but in those days they very uhm that			
way very sophisticated people very traditional and we keep a			
very have etiquette and all these things			
You know really do literally bend down if

 Ek minute			
I have seen I have seen Salarjung Museum over here			
no at Poona we do have one Museum			
We have Kelkar Museum which has so many			
varieties in sculpture and something in furniture			
Old and ancient things in carving we get it so			
beautifully			
Uh we can see it even it is open for you know 			
all of the visitors and it is known specially for in us			
especially they do have habit and to see that museum			
Uhm Mr Yadav you told something about your native			
place na 			
Yeah			
Which is your native place 			
Native Place is uh U P Azamgarh 			
Oh I see 			
So when did you finish your M A degree 			
In fact I finished my M A some uh from the University			
of Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 			
Uhm I see 			
That means uh you finished it in the university itself 			
Which year could you tell me the year 			
Yeah 			
Right in nineteen eighty-seven 			
After that what have you been doing since then 			
Infact after uh in uh nineteen eighty-seven almost uh			
 in July I got my degree M A degree			
And uh after that I taught in a college almost for four year			
uh four months and uh of course and uh after that 			
since it was a private college and uh I didn't hope much from			
this college 			
And meanwhile fortunately I got a job in state			
government school and uh I took up this job now I'm 			
going on with this job 			
 Oh is that 			
Uh uh are you happy with this present job 			
 It's all it laughs to a certain extent			
 uh I'm happy 			
But since it's a very interior part of uh Jabalpur			
city 			
So sometimes I don't find uhm me at ease 			
Eh in the in the sense it was uh high I'm 			
appointed there as a English teacher uh but things are quite			
different there			
I don't find people who can uh speak with me in			
English ah or even whenever I teach in in the classes uh			
I quiet often I used by mother tongue Hindi			
So from uh my part I like something that			
uh 			
 Ah 			
 It means uh since you do not get the			
opportunity to use English outside the classroom or even inside the			
classroom you are not fully satisfied with the present Job 			
 Oh yeah well I'm not uh fully satisfied			
 because in fact uh English is a second language for me and 			
uh unless uh we uh take up or continue with the uhm unless			
we follow the uhm four available skills of learning second language 			
then I don't think it will be better for a learner to develop or uh			
Okay I understand that			
Now since you are doing the P G C T now after going back			
 is it possible for you to use simple English in the classroom itself			
Yeah I would like to uhm use simple English as			
much as uh possible 			
Since uh student there where I teach they're 			
not able to understand uh even simple sentences 			
But even then I would like to do uhm my best particularly			
I would like to use English sentences simple sentences			
So that uh they can uh make an effort to understand the			
sentences 			
Yeah that's what I also feel better because 			
to to begin with you can use simple English simple sentences			
And uh after one month or so on after one month or so 			
you can increase the standard step by step 			
And I think you'll be successful in using English inside			
the classroom also 			
And when you meet some friends when you go here and there to			
different places you can use uh English and so I think uh you			
can improve a lot 			
Then what's your future plan 			
That is uh to continue the school or to search for another job 			
Well uhm infact uh I need a lot of improvement 			
particularly in my spoken English and uh particularly			
pronunciation stress intonation and uh there're uh			
other fields of English there I find myself uh uhm but I			
realise that uh I lack something 			
So my next plan would be eh to take up Diploma course from			
C I E F L Hyderabad			
And I wish I would be able to do my best 			
Yeah			
Now I've understood uh much from you I've			
 understood your carrer and so on 			
But so far I've not informed to you anything about me 			
Uhm well you as you know my name is Chandrashekhar 			
And actually I belong to the south India Tamil Nadu 			
Kanyakumari district 			
And presently I'm teaching in st Joseph's College			
 Chakama Kohima Nagaland 			
Teaching in a college where there is P U degree pre degree 			
Then B A also is there 			
B A two year plus one year 			
B A pass course and B A honours 			
 I'm teaching there for all the three year students			
And I'm happy with my job 			
Uhm salary is okay 			
Then the people the students are also well co-operative			
Then my wife is also working in the college			
So everything is quite okay with me 			
Uh if you want to know something more about me you are free to			
ask 			
Uh when did you get this job 			
I got this job in nineteen eighty-six			
Nineteen nineteen eighty-six 			
And uh when did you finish your post graduate			
My post graduation degree I finished it in uh mid June			
nineteen eighty-six			
June nineteen eighty-six 			
 Yes 			
And immediately after that in July nineteen eighty-six I joined the			
post			
Yeah all right			
Uh in fact since you're also doing your uh post			
graduation certificate in teaching English uh after I hope as you			
are doing well and laughs and uh you are supposed to get			
good grade as well in the what would be your next step 			
Are you going to take up your Diploma course			
Or uh if you get suppose if you get uh uh A grade or A plus 			
then uh would you like to take up your M Litt			
Certainly			
Master of Litt			
Yeah certainly 			
I my ambition is this one to do my Diploma and			
complete my M Litt then if possible M Phil also so that I can cover			
the literature side also English literature then at last do			
my Ph D it's my aim 			
But I think things will go on well 			
Shall I take your opinion about your 			
academic career 			
Uh you talk talk about your M Phil and Diploma as well			
But I don't think it's my own opinion uh once			
you have degree of uh Diploma in the teaching of English from C I E F L			
Hyderabad and most of the universities of our country uh have uh			
accepted this Diploma equivalent to M Phil degree 			
Then I don't think it would better for you to do again 			
your M Phil 			
And it would be better to do your M Litt after your Diploma			
Yeah what you've said is correct			
But uh after doing M Phil uh Diploma I directly wanted to			
 do my M Litt course 			
And then if possible I'll cover up in order to			
cover up the literature area also I feel like doing M Phil if possible			
Suppose if uh you finish your M Litt I think it's			
 your ambition and is a desire as well 			
And then uh would you like to think something uh about			
your Ph D 			
Quite often we find people interested uh in doing Ph D 			
Uhm somewhere even some from the from some universities			
But uh doing Ph D from C I E F L Hyderabad is not an easy			
task 			
Because uh we are supposed to perform well there only then			
Ph D degree is awarded there			
So uh what is your next plan			
What about your next plan in future to do your Ph D from C I E F L			
Hyderabad or some uh other universities of our country 			
It is yet uhm uhm very interesting question that you have			
asked me 			
Actually it is not an easy task to do our Ph D from C I E 			
especially in E L T 			
But before that I want to give extra reading to improve			
myself 			
So that I can when I finish my Diploma M Litt and M Phil			
 with wider reading I think I'll be able to uh complete			
my Ph D very well in a satisfactory way 			
Okay			
You have told me all about yourself			
Now could you tell me something about your family background			
 your parents and how many children are there in the family and so on 			
Right I infact my family is cons consist of			
 uh six seven members seven members 			
Uh my parents and uh my two brothers and uh two			
sisters and I've a wife and I've a son as well			
Right infact my father is uh at Calcutta he			
is in Port Trust as a Cargo Officer there			
And uh next year sometime uh in June he is going to			
 retire 			
And uh as far as uh my question is concerned I'm 			
the man uhm yeah 			
Are you the eldest in the family 			
Yeah no my one of my sister is the youngest			
 I'm sorry eldest and uh I'm the next to her 			
I see 			
What about you			
Would you like to uhm give some details about yourself			
Why not sure			
See in our family we're five children to our			
parents 			
Three sisters and two brothers including me 			
My both the parents are farmers only 			
My eldest sister is married to a Police Officer 			
He is in Tamil Nadu 			
The second sister is married to A N J C O serving in the army			
And myself you know a lot about me since we've 			
been staying for a long time 			
Not long time about two weeks back 			
Then my youngest younger brother he is doing his B E now			
Then youngest one is doing her B A class B A Economics 			
 so 			
 What about your wife			
Ah I forgot to tell me laughs tell you about my wife			
 I'm sorry 			
Uhm she is also a Post Graduate in English 			
And she is working in the same college 			
Along with you			
Along with me 			
And I've got a son also			
Yeah that's the thing			
Yeah laughs he is one year old and one year and			
two months old 			
A very naughty boy 			
Naughty boy 			
Yeah very clever			
He has got after you			
Say like this quiet naughty boy cough 			
Yeah children are supposed to be naughty at the			
beginning			
Hope it is 			
But he is very clever so everything is well 			
And uh I like the family I'm a happy man so to			
so to say 			
That is the matter uh for you its good that you			
have uh a wife and a son 			
You must be very happy man having a wife who is			
working with you in the same college 			
And uh don't you think uh whenever you work in the same			
college you find some sort of uh uhm problem 			
Problem I mean uh working in a same college in same in			
the same de department 			
Don't you find uh some sort of trouble or some sort of 			
cont or controversy as such			
 You see uh 			
There is no trouble or problem as such 			
But the only problem with us is getting leave from 			
the principal 			
 That's the only problem 			
When she wants to do any course or anything she can't get			
leave			
And when I want to do anything I also I'm not free to			
get leave 			
This is the only problem we face when we work together in the			
same college and nothing else 			
The other things are okay because we're working in			
the same place 			
And we have the opportunity of being together always and it			
is something interesting 			
A few days infact I would like to take you to uhm I			
would like to take you in this politics 			
And uh I think uh you you must be familiar uh with the			
conditions going on that our country is facing 			
Uhm political disasters and uh disorders and election has			
taken place a few weeks earlier 			
And uh what shall would be your opinion and that no			
party again has come into power			
And I think uh uh in your opinion as far as my opinion is			
concerned I would like to uh uh I want uh if India needs uh 			
British rule or uh next alternative 			
What would be the next alternative would you like to suggest 			
But uh clearing the throat what has happened			
this year is really a political disaster 			
But even then I still have faith in democracy 			
But all the political systems ha have their own			
defects 			
Even then I believe in democracy and uh India needs			
a better leader 			
One who can do and one who can do well for the people			
Now we have been talking about everything since you belong to			
 since you belong to M P could you tell me something about your state			
 It's alright infact I went to Jabalpur 			
A well known city of uh M P state 			
I went there in nineteen eighty-five 			
I uh before uh I had uh no sort of any idea about uh M P			
And uh but there I found people particularly in the			
field of pol politics 			
There politics is based on some sort of principles 			
And uh leaders are supposed to do some work concrete work			
 uh for the public 			
And infact uh same people sometime they favour uh			
 Congress-I and sometime they favour 			
 Bharatiya Janata Party but they're but			
infact there uh politics is based there uh on uh some sort of			
principles 			
They are not going to show the same beaten track like uh			
 other states U P Bihar where politics is totally based on uhm			
casteism 			
 Laughter 			
Really 			
Just imagine we have to wait here for half an hour 			
And just doing this 			
They must be wondering what we are doing no ?			
Yes laughs 			
And nobody is going to find us here 			
because we are locked here laughs 			
Locked from outside laughs 			
Feeling nice 			
But next week by this time			
Uhm			
Finished most of the papers			
Which ?			
How many days ?			
Two days more			
Uhn today is the final day so naturally we have uh			
 nine more days to go say 			
Nine 			
Isn't it ?			
Nine ten			
Uh ten			
Because Sun Sunday is also counted you know 			
And whatever it is I am waiting for the thirtieth 			
Ah 			
Because I was actually waiting for these classes and not for			
the exams because I know what I am going to do there because I am not			
at all prepared 			
Even I am not prepared actually we hardly get any time			
to study no when we work			
Uhm 			
You know it's very difficult for us			
You being in college it was something different and for			
school we have to be there right from ten to four ten 			
And then our headmistress is very particular about our			
correction and all that 			
To add with it our system is very exam oriented 			
Every second day we have some examination and some correction 			
Even we have exams 			
In that way actually every four months or three months we have 			
because we have pre- test and test and annual and half yearly and all			
this things naturally it uh just has to be done 			
And our college is more like a school you know 			
That uh 			
This principal she is very particular about it 			
All that discipline has to be maintained you know 			
But in Orissa you know Lecturers have a very nice time there			
 uhm like there is nobody to actually check on them 			
They may or may not take classes 			
And children bank on the tuitions rather than on the			
lectures 			
So if you are very wealthy you do very well 			
 That's how it goes 			
See over here we are bothered about linguistics and grammar			
and all we don't know what's happening in India no the whole 			
 this way it's in such a turmoil stage and we are not			
We are more or less			
 Not bothered about 			
We are more or less more we are more or less in a			
linguistic island you say 			
 Lingui laughter 			
Cut off from the world 			
 Cut off from the world			
And daily now we le read linguistic talk			
linguistic walk linguistic			
And we have to be conscious of our actions and all these			
things no all the time can't we live free 			
Actually when we return we'll have to get into our old			
habit for sometime and then comeback to linguistics again laughs			
 That's all 			
Nothing to 			
But I don't know what I am going to do for the exams no ?			
 It's such a I have never been so unprepared for			
the exams as I am now 			
Because uh I just couldn't study and now all the things are			
coming in at once			
Yeah 			
You can get you are getting to understand the whole thing			
at once you know 			
So naturally it's very difficult for us to take uh			
 things inside and capture it and then produce it 			
 And repeat in the examination paper			
Actually it's very tough 			
 But then 			
 But 			
It is one way it's good that atleast we are			
getting to know something atleast better than because all of us can't			
take leave all of can't be accomodated in Hyderabad in C I F L 			
So it's one way we are getting a touch of it not			
the whole thing but a touch of it 			
Whatever it is you know I am not the results 			
I was interested to get some of my concept clear 			
And I feel I was able to clear some of it I was bothered about my			
pronunciation I was bothered about some of my grammatical mistakes and			
all that and there was nobody there whom I could approached to you see			
So I thought this course would be a great help to me I am not			
bothered about the result part of it 			
 Even I 			
Actually because we teach in a our circumstances and			
surroundings are so no that we get we are separated from the English			
speaking people as it is because in my place no one speaks English only I			
speak 			
And whom I to speak in that way 			
 That's why we are confined in our area especially I			
living in this rural area these people they don't even know English			
nothing so it becomes very difficult for me 			
And I was getting to forget my pronunciations also			
Now you see you see Dr Jairaman you want in my group today			
no 			
Dr Jairaman check me so many time 			
But I I don't know how it come to because I I in			
pronunciations I was never checked 			
That was one thing spelling and pronunciation I was always right			
you know 			
But just because I am not habituated with I am not 			
getting 			
 Practice 			
One thing right from school days I should say uhm some of			
the pronunciation that we were taught was wrong 			
And whatever I had picked up it is from the media whatever it			
is because I had interest in it I tried to rectify myself 			
But whatever we were taught during our school days was something			
 completely different 			
And almost I should say it was something wrong that was taught to			
us			
So I feel these things should be taught to the primary teachers 			
they should go through these 			
All the English medium school the so called English			
medium schools 			
The teacher should go through this sort of training where			
they can rectify the pronunciation before they give it to little one			
 Definitely 			
 It should be 			
Yeah			
Because it is there where the base is formed 			
And once things get destructed there means whole life is			
 They can't change			
You can't change 			
If you rec it's mean very it's 			
uh difficult to rectify the wrong and then come in to correction you			
know we learnt in our method haan this thing			
 Haan 			
But actually I was taught in a very I told you last			
night no that I had a very surrounding and very good uh people 			
who taught me			
So it came in to me as my first language 			
I even forgot my mother tongue when I first went into 			
there learning not learning it was a language acquisition rather than			
language learning for me 			
Because I was placed in that position so I am very lucky in that			
way you know which I got now how but			
 Now how 			
 But 			
Just because I am placed my setting now the			
atmosphere I live in is totally Bengali 			
So naturally I am getting to forget it I I			
said I'll another few days if I stay over there I'll 			
also forget the name of Sha the spelling of Shakespeare 			
 Yeah 			
Actually you have to give			
 Haan that's very natural 			
sneeze 			
One thing in our place that is in that is in Bhubaneshwar 			
first and foremost if you speak English means they will alienate you			
 Haan 			
They will say that means we are of 			
Showing off and all these things they'll say			
 Relationship there becomes very formal you have			
to speak in Oriya in order to be like them otherwise they will just throw			
you out of their group			
No but here they think that they'll you are			
showing off			
 Haan 			
If you speak English you are showing off			
 Haan 			
That is another part of it 			
And one more thing another thing how I rectified myself			
because all almost all all of us all my brother and sisters we			
have read in English medium school 			
And naturally we used to fight and quarrel a lot a lot			
Yeah			
And we used to do that in English 			
 So that is how we use to rectify each other and 			
somehow we could that is how I could I can speak little bit of			
correct yes English 			
 Yes it was 			
 Yes 			
But you are actually the means thing that they			
should 			
Uh I think uh they should e extend the say			
you know of this course 			
It should be one and half months or two months you no			
Uhm			
Or they can organised the contact programme and then take			
the examination that are later date because we have to we			
can't just read the books 			
And we can't form the ideas see you see the ways 			
Dr this Mr V he was totally changed actually because he was uh the			
concepts are clear not clear to us 			
 Of course 			
We have got the book language the language of the book			
and we just learn it like that and we put it out 			
But we have to clear the concept we have to get the actual			
technical lang languages the term we have to get 			
Like I answered the right thing today I had that concept but I			
didn't know the actual technicality I have to express it 			
because in the book they are just given no one explained it to us no			
 that's why			
 Yeah how to express it 			
For that we need one more month			
One more month yes			
This is too short actually			
 That's what I'm suggesting 			
They should have the programme			
Programme			
Programme and then afterwards 			
 And then 			
The exams afterwards			
They should they should			
They should do that			
It should have that way			
Yeah the organisation			
And now uh uhm what is that heads are so crammed			
Crammed isn't it any way			
It is difficult and I think in lingistic paper I am going to			
write my literature in my literature paper I'll do my politics 			
laughter 			
I don't know what I am going to do 			
Oh yours your head is not reeling any more no ?			
No in the morning I had a tough time I thought I was			
going to fall down			
Even I thought I was fal you wouldn't feel to go			
also I was getting quite scared you know 			
But I was definite it was because of the food yesterday			
Not			
Should have			
I think it was my pressure 			
Pressure went up 			
May be the pressure has gone up high again 			
And I was scared			
 But you 			
You got medicine for it 			
No I didn't bring my medicine			
Why ?			
Because I am very bad at taking medicine 			
No but should you know these are life saving drugs you			
know you should keep them			
So that is the that was the problem and today if I			
wouldn't have taken little rest I don't know what I would have done			
throughout the day 			
Yeah you should have			
No but uh I think you must be because your stomach			
was upset that's why the pressure up it must be			
Upset no			
Upset in the sense that you didn't take food it was empty all			
the gas formation and all that it can			
I know suddenly this reeling sensation 			
It was something from that as soon as I got up from the			
bed I needed support 			
I thought I was going to fall down somewhere 			
So I hurriedly had everything I had my bath and everything and			
finally I came down to thejust 			
You can feast for the night today no			
 Haan laughter 			
I missed it I really missed it awful 			
I didn't know actually and I this lady this Rekha she			
came and told me then she had sent it			
I should say we have got uh			
 So I 			
She said she had sent it so I said she had sent I thought			
they had arranged the boys and all and I haven't given my name 			
So I said I won't take it I said take it back please I won't			
take it 			
She should have told me Miss Ranjana sent it then I could			
have because it was also not good to sent the refuse the thing back			
no			
It was but I told her I explained that I didn't know it			
actually 			
And now what class do we have ?			
 It's another class of grammar and linguistics again			
 			
 St's college from Madras university and yet 			
still deciding on what topic we would like to talk on 			
I am Padma doing my Ph D here in literature teaching			
I am Srilata doing my Ph D here 			
I am Subalakshmi doing PGM here 			
I am Swarnalatha doing by MA in English literature 			
I am Ramkumar doing my M Phil in English literature 			
I am Louis doing my MA here 			
Well we have decided to talk uh on women's 			
liberation to begin with and we may move on to other topics later 			
What do you think of women's liberation Louis 			
 Women's liberation is basically uh a noble			
concept but but the whole question is the ball is actually in the			
 women's court I would say 			
If I think woman should be a lot more assertive then what they			
are now 			
And I think they are allowing themselves to be more			
conditioned than it is more that they condition themselves then men			
conditioning them 			
I object to what Louis said 			
No doubt question of the woman being conditioned the society			
which plays a major role in fact the society doesn't give a woman a			
chance to prove her abilities 			
She sort of repress and any attempt of a woman to liberate			
herself is met is met with strong disapproval 			
So I think the ball is in the men's court because 			
No but somehow I think you are contradicting yourself in			
some ways 			
Uh as you said it's not actually men or women 			
that's not the question at all			
You yourself said that it is the society that controls			
Society made both men and women 			
So uhn I think we when we talk of women's liberation			
we immediately the association is that it is anti-men 			
Uh I would like to question that definition first 			
No but India is mostly a patriarchal society			
So it's men who play a more important role right in			
all your decision making and what about this however modern we may			
get to but still the same 			
We haven't broken up from our ancient roots 			
 That's what we call 			
I would like to object to the first statement that she made			
 that society conditions a woman 			
I don't belive in society as such			
I think the individual is superior to society 			
I don't understand why uh individual should allow society to			
dominate over his his or her individuality 			
So the question of women's liberation is not that 			
society suppresses a woman 			
It is just that the woman refuses to do anything that			
could alleviate her suffering 			
I think the speaker is talking about about an utopian			
society which can never exists 			
Because the individual is very much a part of the society			
He can't alleviate himself from the society 			
What I feel is only the education and the economical			
status makes a woman to feel very liberated 			
So every woman must be educated and must be employed 			
Then only they can be free taking decisions			
Economically they will feel so 			
What do you feel about it 			
Well I feel uh now uh we have been given equal chances			
with men and uh almost in all uh position even women are have			
been working 			
I mean only thing we have to utilise the chances properly and			
 get into proper positions and make woman come up somewhere			
Educate them basically and then make them also come up and			
 be one with men 			
I totally disagree that the women they are not taking up			
any initiatives 			
See for the last two or three decades as or so we find that			
women they've reached a real good status to over the men			
 in each and every field that they have participated 			
Say now we find that that women they			
are given a voice 			
They are given a platform rather to voice their own opinions			
 in each and every field be in press be in writing fiction 			
writing poetry they have come up in a great way			
But don't you think that that is more an exception than a rule			
How many women assert themselves 			
If you take an average Indian woman you take an average Indian			
woman I think the Indian woman does not think more than marriage			
and settling down in life 			
An Indian women's ultimate objective in life is to marry			
and settle down			
 You take you take an educated Indian			
woman in a Indian society			
She might have done her MA or Ph D but what is ultimate			
objective she wants to get married 			
This marriage is the ultimate ideal of society or an individual			
It cannot be this			
No but marriage is just a part of uh life			
you know but when we're getting ourselves educated there is no point			
sitting at home as such doing Ph D's and all that hey			
you can just sit with your BA or 			
 No that is not the opinion of 			
 That's what I'm saying it's 			
more an exception than a rule 			
It is more an exception than a rule 			
Perhaps a few of you who are doing a Ph D think that way 			
How many come to the MA classes by the way 			
No no this is the situation I mean it's bad			
 but the situation seems to have taken a change over the			
past			
 I challege that 			
 They've but far to far to gradual to have			
any any impact on society			
But I still feel that there is a percent of change 			
As she said our's is a patriarchal society and to			
move away from the patriarchal society it takes some time			
 It's not so easy 			
Exuse me you are talking about marriage it's necessary			
you do because there is no sec security for a single woman 			
She is not respected that's a fact			
No but I think his point was 			
 I I'm not I'm not advocating			
 uh I'm not advocating a woman being a spinster okay 			
 You've got me wrong 			
I am not trying to say that 			
But what I'm I am only taking the exception to a 			
woman's ultimate objective being marriage 			
That is wicked of the society that's what 			
I've been trying to tell you			
No but I have one question to ask what is you 			
 Why should it be why should it be 			
You you have been educated you should learn to be independent			
Now one second 			
But who gives that kind of notion that that's going to be			
your objective 			
 It's a mother it's a father it's a			
brother at home			
Yeah			
Or you know you you are taught even when a child is born 			
look at all that the advertising that we listen to 			
The bank says you save save money for your son's 			
education and save for your daughter's marriage 			
 Marriage 			
You are talking 			
So its there			
You you are talking you're talking of			
conditioning of a person okay 			
A person an ess essential an individual			
An individual should assert himself			
No that as you say is a very utopian concept			
No no I I strongly disagree 			
 Because an individual can not exist 			
Please do not dismiss it as a utopian I strongly disgree			
with that view 			
It is not utopian			
 It's very much practical only we refuse to be			
practical that is all			
What you say a woman should does not talk about it don't look			
at her objective point of her			
I am not I'm not being objective 			
Good going I think we'll have a change in the			
topic now uh we will talk of the examination system uh to which all			
of us are agreed to 			
Yes why don't you begin 			
Exam system what do you feel that uh you are getting			
your rights the exam present kind of exams			
No ma'am I feel examination should be abolished			
I mean at specially at your graduate under graduate level 			
post graduate level 			
I mean they don't help the students in any way 			
Infact they sort of hamper the pleasure one receives			
from learning 			
You don't learn for pleasure you learn for marks 			
So it should be done away			
Does everyone subscribe to this view			
What would you like to say Ramkumar			
No what I still feel is there should be some way in			
which the lecturer should be in a position to gauge the performance of the			
students			
And one good way is examination 			
But what I still feel is the continuous assessment system 			
will work out in a better way rather than having a three hour examination			
Yeah 			
Say at the fag end of the session to evaluate the students			
No don't you think uh that the question of a teacher			
 gauging a students performance is utilatarian 			
That is a high utilitarian concept you are prostituting knowledge			
No not at all 			
How do you claim			
Why why do you want to gauge a students performence 			
students knowledge you learn a few words 			
 A few words 			
 You've to place a student where 			
where he stands 			
 That's equally important because at the higher			
studies 			
 As I feel 			
As I feel that is what I am saying it is a highly utilatarian			
concept			
You want to test the students so that you know whether you sit			
for this whether you sit for this whether you sit for this 			
 That's it 			
Whether he is qualified for any promotion or not will			
have to be determined by the lecturer 			
Listen examinations don't don't examinations			
really do not uh speak of their real ability as such 			
Your abilities are quite different from what you something			
that you take for harassment 			
 Well I am 			
 That's about the evaluation system 			
Yes one shade of the ability is that the lecturers 			
they test when they evaluate the students 			
 What you know is from the nature 			
 Whether from a guide simply use it			
He may not really get the spirit of 			
 That's not I mean to say 			
The continuous assessment system is far better of than having			
an examination at the end of the year or at the end of couple of			
years			
No no there so many problems in continuous			
assessment that have come out now			
 Even if the 			
I don't think students really feel confident 			
 It's again putting them into a kind of uh modern			
slavery to the department concerned 			
And that has also been uh pointed out by many and			
not every teacher can be really made objective 			
 No what I really wanted is to make the 			
objective elements of the teacher comes into play then 			
But what I still feel is you've different means and			
methods by which you can evaluate the students to continue the assessment 			
You can say introduce a seminar pattern the panel			
discussion group discussion ask the students speak out in class 			
regularly and then assess the student instead of asking him to sit			
for a three hours examination 			
And then assess him on that basis 			
 Yeah in comparision yes			
In comparision yes 			
No but uh when you are taking a seminar or something			
like that no one or two students from the class only uh read the			
others you cannot say all of them are listening in the class			
No he should have been given a topic to the before			
the class 			
 I mean but when you are asked I mean when you			
are asked to write an exam all of us have to write			
No each one of the student is asked to present a			
paper 			
 Should be given then			
Yeah obviously 			
But then we have other uh difficulties as well 			
Say the class strength is massive you can't uh expect			
each and every student to present in a seminar 			
Or ask each and every student to participate in a group discussion			
Especially in general English classes where the strength is			
over seventy 			
So the case is whether examination should be conducted at all			
 or they shouldn't be conducted at all 			
Now I suppose we've boiled down to that level			
No that's a basic question			
But ultimately in practice I think it is used more as a screening			
 for employer to select			
You know they give prescribe qualifications and that			
provide the kind of uh screening for them 			
Know some kind of uh proof that they have selected somebody			
with certain certain qualification			
Yeah its very			
Whether that qualification really uh matters and			
whether it really gives them the skills that are necessary for the job is not			
all			
Yeah only for government coughs employment 			
But when you go to the pr private sector it so			
happens that they have their own means and methods of testing the			
students 			
See normally they take for example if it's going to			
be a salesman's job what they do is they have a group			
discussion they have an interview			
No even then there is a basic qualification			
Basic qualification is always there 			
Some where somehow somewhere you'll have to 			
scren screen test 			
 Screen 			
But do we always feel that uh you know uh we are a mixed			
ability group normally in the classroom 			
Uh with different backgrounds and all all that			
 I've always felt that uh the differentiation between			
a mediocre student and a good student never really emerges from the			
system that we have at present 			
You now the ma it is very marginal 			
The difference is very marginal 			
I don't know how uh you react to it 			
 It's a maybe we're more			
interested in having a national syllabus			
And merging each and every type of institution into one 			
like the CD CIS Tamil Nadu state			
No that is structuralising knowledge you can't we can't			
accept that 			
That is that is something very 			
Rigid 			
Yeah 			
You can't structuralise something and say you compartmentalise			
 you can't compartmenatalise knowledge it's unethical			
Because you don't give license no you don't give 			
give a student access to other branches of knowledge when you			
compartmentalise knowledge			
 Give license 			
This is not compartmentalising knowledge what you mean to say			
is that see we've different systems as the central board of			
secondary education ICSE then we've the state board			
Each and every state having its own uh curricular like			
you know or syllabi 			
Now once you merge have one syllabus for each and			
 for every student who studies in India then may be we were in			
better position to evaluate students performence 			
No but Ramkumar what what you find in the syllabus is not			
a guarantee to what is done in the classroom 			
Shall I speak Rajee			
Start 			
 How's Tandon 			
 He he I don't know I didn't see him			
 after coming back 			
Uh how's Bansal may I know how's Bansal and			
how is he doing			
Very nice			
Yeah			
They came to meet me yesterday			
Uh meet you

And what about your cousin brother there 			
Oh yeah he is fine			
Fine with his family 			
You know			
How did you celebrate your birthday 			
Oh I had lot of fun yaar 			
Started off like my sister-in-law has made a lovely			
ice-cream cake and all know laughter

She realises now

Oh really			
And in the afternoon we went to Poona Poona city

Uh uhn 			
Then they had many			
So how many days did you stay there 			
I stayed there for ten days 			
How much did you study there 			
 You'd been for study there			
Yeah but then I didn't study much 			
As I kept falling sick didn't sit I didn't			
She has got to the trip for falling sick only			
So you had good health for eight days or so 			
Ah uhm 			
So what did you do 			
Kept waiting for you 			
Ah 			
You must have done something useful you no			
I mean I've been to Shirdi			
Ah Shirdi uhm so 			
I came back with the 			
 At shirdi na it's uh			
uh Shi Saibaba's shrine 			
 Right 			
Is there any other god other than Saibaba			
No in Shirdi no 			
This is Shir di Saibaba			
Saibaba I've I've 			
heard that 			
You have heard about it			
Very powerful no 			
Actually he is a I think he's a m his			
religion is unknown uhm uhm 			
His uh			
 Uhm uhm 			
 What's his actual story 			
Which story behind him			
He was just some saint moving around having uh			
alms and all uhm 			
And he used to help people poor people around			
Once a he used to celebrate diwali at his			
place 			
Too much uh with too much of lighting lighting of the lamps			
and all			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm			
 O once one year British Government refused to			
give oil 			
Uhm uhm 			
And he asked these cough people You 			
put water instead of oil 			
So people said ki water how will it			
burn 			
He put uhm they put water and then he he			
said okay now burn like that 			
So they light the lighting of the lamps with water uh			
 on diwali made him very much famous			
 Uhm 			
 Uh 			
Uhm I see that's how he's one word			
 and from them			
The Lata Mangeshkar is the person who has uh personally			
seen him			
Uhm uhm			
One of my aunty who's personally seen him			
She is no more now she died last year i see 			
 She's personally seen that fellow uhm uhm 			
They used to go to that saint			
 I see 			
 Uhm uhm 			
When did he first arrive 			
No in the nineteenth century only uhm I			
think			
 Uhm 			
And uh uh this he had predicted about uh Lata			
Mangeshkar being too famous you know uh 			
In fact uh she is the prasad that uh			
god has given to you told his mother her mother actually 			
uhm got it			
 Uh 			
 Uhm 			
This is the basic story about him			
And I think even my father experienced he never believes in			
many god but he believes in the Saibaba 			
Uhm 			
Well he had to collect too much of funds in the office			
only he has put office only 			
The party that didn't seem to be giving money and all 			
We were passing through Shirdi and he just said that if uh fair			
work is no more uhm 			
We have to accomplish the back uhm I will come to you			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
I see 			
And those party that party which never gave money 			
 uhm gave shelled out money like that 			
 Uhm 			
Shelled out 			
He came back and then he said two words 			
But actually my father never believes in 			
What about you you are a firm believ believer 			
Firm believer I told you no after coming like 			
we've seen about this Saibaba from one word 			
Uhm 			
As you like do you know Tamilians give more importance to			
this Saibaba of their south Indian gives importance to the Bangalore			
Saibaba uhm 			
 You've heard about him na 			
 Uhm 			
Yes I've heard of him			
Uhm that but then we don't believe in ah 			
We believe in direct contact with God 			
 Ah 			
No does it seem			
 It's just like that so there are lot of			
followers in Trivandrum specially Saibaba's this			
But			
Bangalore Saibaba and that I've heard 			
I've heard many stories about his far and this thing you know 			
Oh like 			
From his main devotees of course they have very good			
stories about him			
But from other people I have heard bad stories also about the			
Saibaba 			
So anyway we uhm we prefer to remain neutral on this			
subject as such you know 			
No but uh even I have heard but I have heard only good			
events 			
Uhm got it			
Just like about Rajneesh 			
Ah Rajneesh I know him 			
 Devout neg negative			
Right right			
See even about him quite it is quite negative like 			
He is also using like something about his political powers and all			
that Chandraswami then again			
 Ah ha Chandraswami 			
But then like we don't go to that Sai you know please if you			
want to follow that's fair like yeah present 			
 Yeah 			
 It's only that we don't interfere 			
But those people who've actually established			
themselves this uh at this Saibaba			
Uhm uhm 			
He said he is a one word because he never had money			
he never had power			
Right that's the thing that's the thing			
we need			
Then the moment he died			
Uhm uhm 			
And when he died they were saying was Hindus fought 			
that he was a Hindu 			
Mohammedans fought that he was a Mohammedan and now what to do			
with that			
I see 			
When they came back to his grave 			
 Uhm uhm 			
They removed that cloth that cloth garment garment			
and uh saw 			
There was uh no body there was only flowers 			
So half flowers were taken in bunch uhm uhm 			
and half flowers were put in Mazar that Mazar			
 is made in like uh Shirdi 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Oh that's it 			
And now they have uh literally shown that uh uhm direct			
telecast uh everywhere in every corner of the temples you know 			
 ah they are having uh T V 			
 Ah 			
Oh yes			
 They've shown the whole pooja going			
on uhm in the temple 			
Uhm they have arrangement about it carrying of the Palanquin			
 uhm uhm nine fifteen to ten pm 			
I stayed uh by nine I had finished uhm so I thought			
 I will wait then I just couldn't wait because because I'll			
 miss the bus

Twelve hours 			
Twelve hours

Direct bus is eight thirty bus is here

eight thirty 			
Go at eight thirty and uh reach by about eight 			
O'clock uhm and it's better you know and			
you get a chance to come back on very same day

Because ten at ten O'clock there is a bus coming			
from uh Kopargaon to Hubli 			
Right			
Inter-state

And it's for five minutes stay there stand there			
So how long did you spend there 			
Just one hour or two hours or so 			
Ah one hour			
Uhm uhm

You got the bus and came back 			
 It's because I was alone and I've got some

Uhm			
That uh village got a speciality uh 			
And that is being tested my my father was in one word 			
and said 			
He was going on tour some driver told ki 			
here there is a place uhm 			
No robbers and no one came do robbering robbery			
 over that place			
 Uh 			
 Uhm 			
Vow 			
And if somebody robs or something uhm uhm 			
from this village uhm and after seventeen kilometer 			
circumference of that village uh he'll go blind 			
And until he replaces the thing he can't get his eyes 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uh 			
That is that day			
And uh many examples have been cited but uh I don't			
know whether it's true or not 			
Only thing true is that my father went to the village 			
 uh 			
He saw uh the house that was having just a door to			
keep the cats and uh dogs away from the house 			
No lock no house was having a lock 			
He went inside the house 			
Old man he saw the old man and he got up saw him because he			
didn't recognise my father so he went to sleep back again 			
 Uhm 			
Ahn uhm			
He he knows that nobody can take out anything 			
Yes that's also world for this place to be invited			
Uhm that's true 			
This uh same story I've heard is in Trivandrum there is a			
temple uhm uhm goddess goddess temple it's 			
called a Archaga devi temple 			
And there also we've heard stories like uh two men			
trying to get in 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
And uh these two robbers you know suddenly they got in the			
temple trying to steal the goddesses you know deity as such 			
And then suddenly they were blind and 			
And the main priest of this temple in his dream you know			
 like it it's as if goddess came to him and said see			
there are robbers in the temple go fast 			
He went he saw these two men you know and they were lying down			
blinded 			
They were you know motionless as he didn't know what to do 			
Then immediately he called the police and they were caught			
See no robbery can take place uhm in that			
temple as such 			
 Uhm 			
So which is that temple 			
 Archagadevi temple 			
 Archagadevi 			
Yeah it's very very powerful also			
 Nei and we feel there is nothing like			
something like God but there's something some superpower			
 But there is you know there is there is 			
Even in Ajmer you know uhn what you go and			
tie a thread uhm 			
And you say what you want 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhm 			
Uh you mean uh the one uh the temple			
where you can tie a thread around a tree or something like that			
 Mean there're 			
Uhm			
 I've seen that only in movies			
I told you know how these things			
 It's there it's there in Ajmer you know			
It is 			
Uh it is actually uh Moinuddin Chisti and Ak Ak			
 Akbar made that uh mazar and a temple there 			
 uh uh <,. Masjid you call that you know uh			
 and that's too famous 			
You go uh you want you want to tie 			
and when it is full you turn back and fulfilled you come back 			
 Uh uh 			
 Uh 			
 Uh 			
 Tie 			
Oh it's like that			
And people believe that it is like it is true 			
And even in Vaishnavadevi uhm 			
north you know they say we hear in that all this no they say until			
and unless you are not called you can't go I see 			
Cannot go if any body wants to go also you'll meet with			
an accident something will happen 			
 Uhm 			
 I see 			
 It's like that			
Uhm I mean you just can't go			
Why can't we Still going on			
Uhn			
I doesn't mean a few words 			
There also people say like 			
You can go only when the goddess wants you and there's			
 one more uh area called Garbyodh 			
And even a fat person double fat uh anybody even that Sumati			
 you've seen no 			
If uh she's pure bhakt 			
She wants to cross she will cross 			
And even if a slim person like you any slim lady you can take			
also even if you take Jayshree for sake she goes she cannot go 			
 There's a big or you can go go inside and 			
you've to come out 			
If you come out uhm if you go and come out 			
uhm that means uh you are a very pure person in heart like			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Pure person at heart means uhm you really haven't done			
anything bad and you just you've got a free free from this life			
but after that there'll be no life for you like no more births			
They speak of the deeds			
Yeah yeah			
After this there's going to be no re 			
reincarnation			
Ah I see 			
So when did you come ?			
I came today morning at seven O'clock 			
And I reached here I came by Dakshin Express			
from Delhi			
First from Amritsar I took a train and I came by AC fare 			
and from there I have to take another train which is this Dakshin			
 Express and uh I took second AC there 			
And I don't know how they're going to pay me now 			
laughs 			
There is more than the first class laughs 			
 It's a pleasant experience 			
It was a pleasant experience but also very tiring			
This train is uh it takes thirty-six hours 			
And there is a faster train Andhra Express which takes just			
twenty-four hours 			
But the timing doesn't suit			
Uhm how things are moving in Punjab now-a-days ?			
Punjab is much better now 			
And as you must have read in the papers as they say 			
eighty percent of the problem is solved 			
It is really solved because one can lead a normal life now 			
But twenty percent problem is there 			
Twenty percent means that you don't feel it			
You see I mean crime is always there 			
So you can say some extortionist some terrorist whatever may be			
there 			
But for uh for practical purposes I mean when the life was			
disturbed that thing was not there			
What do you think about this Ayodhya problem now ?			
I think it's a bad thing whatever has happened			
And uh I think the educated Hindu people 			
 they they also think			
The silent majority thinks that it's a wrong thing 			
I mean this is exactly what happened in Punjab you know when			
 the Akalis 			
 Do Punjabi's think is it's 			
uh something wrong			
Yeah will they be in favour of BJP ?			
No they think it's wrong 			
Because a similar thing happened with the Akalis 			
Uh they started listening to people who were not within the party			
 like that Bindrawala or uh modern things that worsened the terrorists			
or whatever			
So now BGP BJP has taken orders from uh			
 sadhus and sanyasis uhm			
yes			
So they don't face the same problem what I feel that it could			
turn out to be that way 			
 Sadhus and sanyasis 			
Oh so it may turn out like a boomrang			
Yes it I think it will be like that because you see			
 uh people majority as I said majority of the people they are			
aware of all this now 			
Even the uneducated people many of them they want to live			
in peace 			
And all this disturbs peace 			
Some people feel that there is a kind of new awareness 			
and because of that BJP is likely to be benefitted			
 There's no awareness 			
These are all political stunts I think 			
Oh well are you happy here Satyam ?			
 It's too early to say that but so far it's 			
fine 			
And uh I've to be careful of the mosquitoes here 			
laughter 			
And uh I think it should be fine and I had long desired to come			
here because uh it is the what you say Mecca for uh English			
 English 			
You you don't have mosquitoes there in your home ?			
No we have mosquitoes there			
But mosquitoes of CIEFL are famous laughter 			
I mean that what you told 			
Uh you see the mosquitoes are there mosquito curtains are			
not there and uh 			
No you see we in Amritsar there's it's			
 an extreme weather ah ha I mean it's very cold			
there now and it will be hotter than what is here now 			
So when it's severe cold mosquitoes will die out and 			
severe wint uh summers they'll again die			
 Ah ha 			
 Mosquitoes are there 			
Uhm so they are only some laughter 			
So you are free from mosquitoes 			
Not throughout the year but of course and here you			
see the mosquitoes are well bred laughs uhm yes so there they			
die and then again they have to come up			
And then they attack 			
But I don't know why they can't control it 			
I mean in uh when I'm uh during the mosquito season in			
like Amritsar and many cities especially in uh let's say			
some good colonies the municipalities they spray 			
So if the muncipality of Hyderabad			
So what would be the reason then ?			
I think uh there should be a spray in the campus the			
mosquitoes			
We won't have them in the campus			
Simple reason is if you want to control you can control if			
you don't laughter and			
So if CIEFL is doing such good work in languages 			
 ah it should do this little work of killing mosquitoes also 			
laughs 			
 Ah 			
So after uh hearing so much about uh CIEFL 			
uhm and coming over here uhm uh what exactly you want			
to do ?			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
See actually I came here of course			
For refresher course that's all right			
To get refreshed laughter 			
And uh a friend of mine says uh the Hyderabad is			
famous for pearls 			
He has given me some money to buy some 			
So I've up to look out for somebody who knows what pearls			
are because I don't know what they are haan 			
And there are a lot of uh artificial uh sellers uhm 			
So I will have to buy some pearls for a friend of mine and uh			
 I will visit uh there's a museum they say			
 Haan 			
 Uhm 			
Uh Salarjung			
And uh a fort 			
 That's why I wanted five days a week 			
And I also told Dr Prakasham to arrange something for atleast			
people from outside			
Yes			
I mean you're you are an outsider			
Yes yes 			
Though of course you must have seen everything because you have			
been staying here 			
But still there are many could be many people who haven't 			
or a few of them so			
They have made the programme very tight 			
 It's very correct 			
And they treat us as uh school children laughter 			
 because they don't allow or they dont give any time to 			
They they can have the same number of sessions same number of			
speakers and uh with uh one lecture say if it's one and			
half hours make it one hour and with teacher there also he just			
keeps			
Would you would you like to come out with uh your idea 			
when we find something is impo imposed from above			
Uhm uhm			
Then people accept it as it is 			
And 			
Uh yes			
They don't want			
They say the UGC says so many working hours			
Uhm sometimes the UGC says and we find uh what goes			
in political circle			
So I think what ever you think in academic also 			
I think what they should do is they should make it from			
 let's say five-thirty to six-thirty everyday 			
One hour is added there 			
Cut off Saturday and adding one hour means missing one hour			
 because laughter ) when the programme is too long you will			
naturally cut it short			
No in Maharashtra what they say that there is 			
adeshraj uhm and as when something comes from			
above it could not be challenged whether it is rational or irrational			
 accept it and act upon it 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm see that's on paper you see 			
No that laughter so 			
 so little			
I requested them why not to turn some of the sessions			
into library sessions			
Yeah			
And then all of us could have got benefitted			
What is this project that they are talking about ?			
You can have any project ah of your choice			
 Ah 			
Uhm			
If project means we can you have to say have particular			
topic			
You have to work on that topic and this is the way the thing			
could be done dealt 			
This is what you have to 			
 Achha so you just uh 			
You know synopsis of the project			
What is it ?			
No they don't give			
 Haan 			
They don't give you have to have a data			
Uhm			
For uh yes if you have a problem			
Uhm uhm and then you work on that			
Then you work on that either in the library or field or			
whatever it maybe			
So it's just like writing of the paper			
 That's all			
 That's all 			
Suppose I want to work on two novels will it do ?			
Oh yes 			
Why two ?			
One one one yes that is nei but thay are			
also saying that you have to present a paper at the end			
That is the same work 			
When you work on a particular say a			
 Nei nei they were talking about two			
different things that everybody has to speak for about ten minutes on			
something and then several others			
 Nei once you have a project 			
Uhn			
Definitely you've to present a paper 			
 Nei but that's compulsory for all ?			
No that ten minutes business is compulsory			
 It's that is compulsory 			
So that again a paper and project is again a paper 			
No both in all you have			
Faster than One or two words that will be for every			
body			
That is for everybody right 			
And the project the problem that you work on you have to			
present that also			
You have half an hour choice			
Half an hour			
And then discussion			
Discussion is also going to be about cross question and all			
what we have so I think the four speaker is going to be just this			
That is a just 			
Uh first ten minutes talk and then half an hour talks 			
by the participants 			
See for pretty long time that practice teaching sessions			
are there 			
And still we find they are not ready to come out of that 			
So here also it's a kind of practice teaching 			
Yeah 			
And as we find these things are not there we are			
there laughter 			
It is uh it is going to be you you are going to have B Ed			
teaching			
No, not I but see paper reading comes to that 			
Actually see in uh one months time is it possible for you			
to present a really something that can be called the research paper ?			
Yeah on that project that's that's way			
research take here that's right 			
See when you get some grant from UGC or something			
like that then you have to present something 			
Uhm Uhm			
In one form or the other 			
No but I don't think uh this must be the case in other			
refresher courses			
Might not be			
This is a kind of thing			
In other refresher courses what atmosphere you find 			
atleast you find here after noon sessions are there there are no			
afternoon sessions 			
I did my first at Pune and what atmosphere no refresher			
 so no afternoon sessions nothing like that			
 Achha you've done one			
Only from nine to one and then completely free 			
Now they were I think about five uh different refresher			
courses now this			
Yes one is uh one is at Jaipur uh Pune uh at yes			
Vishakapatnam			
No no Trivandrum Shimla 			
My catchment area was Simla 			
Uh but I didn't want to go there and from cold Amritsar to			
colder Simla say laughter 			
The freezing point 			
So I wanted to come to number number one of course Hyderabad			
 uh and I wanted to come and also that it'll be nice here			
In my case what happened we were at the Ulakh Vidyanagar			
 Shriraman and myself uhm uhm 			
And Shriraman is the co-ordinator co-ordinator			
here 			
So why not uh why don't you come to Hyderabad			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Co-ordinator 			
Okay it's alright			
 That's how I'm in Hyderabad 			
laughter 			
And we've only six from out of hundred and five			
applicants			
Yes that's what			
You were of course very fortunate very fortunate laughter			
But what what must be the criterion for this ?			
One criterion he has mentioned laughter 			
That is the one			
 That's right			
That is the one that's right			
So one he has mentioned			
No but what I must be find even for that the other			
things are there I brought my English from one word now I'm			
 on there correspondence department			
Oh you think you are			
Only not because uh he knows me and I know him 			
that's not the thing 			
That way I was lucky to know Dr Prakashan also laughter			
 you know how it is particularly what I like uh what you said			
 A few words in Sanskrit 			
 He's a very laughter 			
He is a very practical man			
 He's uh I did my M Phil from Patiala ah			
He was there in the department called Anthropological linguistic			
 oh 			
That department was started by this professor called professor			
Ranjit Gill 			
He is in JNU in what is that department of uh uh			
department of English			
 Ah 			
 Oh 			
Technologist I think school of language			
School of language			
He is a professor there uhm 			
He had started all that department 			
And Dr Kasiwal was also there 			
And he taught us phoenetics that time and I know him			
since then 			
And very			
 Uhn 			
But uh			
So what what is appli no what is applicable to me			
 the same thing is applicable to him also laughter 			
Hey you Prakash laughter 			
I am Malini Bhattacharya 			
I am Anita working as a language assistant in C I I L 			
How do you like Mysore 			
 It's okay I miss my friends in Hyderabad 			
Don't you miss your home 			
I stayed two years in Hyderabad so I got adjusted to			
hostel life and didn't miss it but 			
Here I miss my friends in Hyderabad			
Don't you have friends here 			
I do have but the close ones I miss I can't say I don't			
have friends			
What about you how do you like Mysore 			
Okay the climate is nice the place is nice but even the same			
case with me also I do miss home and do miss my friends 			
But otherwise how is it			
How is the place 			
Quite good isn't it			
How do you feel			
Okay fine did you go around Mysore 			
Not much uh you see we have such busy schedules 			
it's so many we get less time you have a little socialising to do and			
then on one word so 			
Not much but okay 			
I have been to a few places and uh and the remaining few I plan			
to see later 			
How about you 			
Uh I have been to the Palace and spaces uh places			
like that 			
I went to Chamundi Hills 			
Okay it was nice and I joined here much later than you so 			
I think it takes some time to get used to my work also			
Yeah			
How do you like the work 			
Okay isn't it			
Quite challenging			
Well 			
I do find it interesting I hope you'll also find it			
interesting 			
What about this weekend what are you planning to do 			
Nothing as such 			
Maybe I will go to city see how it is how life is here 			
How about going to Ooty some day 			
How far is it from here 			
Uh its as far as my knowledge goes its around one fifty			
kilometres 			
So how many hours it will take 			
By bus not more than six hours 			
It should be actually around four but since you have the mountain			
routes and the one word it will come around say not more than			
 six hours am I wrong 			
I have no idea actually but uh is the journey comfortable			
by bus 			
Or I suppose the project people all of us could hire a			
vehicle and go			
Would that uh			
Yeah one word 			
Would that be very nice			
I mean it depends on what uh all of us agree upon isn't			
it 			
Yeah then you have to talk to everybody and decide about			
Yeah and uh			
But before that uh for the weekend we can plan something and			
go somewhere no 			
Spend some time outside atleast away from your work 			
Uh not this week			
Actually uh this week I am going down to the friend's 			
place in uh Bangalore 			
I am planning to leave Saturday morning and be and I'll			
 be coming back around uh say Sunday evening 			
What about you			
What are you planning to do since I'll not be around 			
Then I'll have to look for somebody else because			
 laugh I still don't know many people around 			
Okay somebody else's some somebody else is there			
I can go to city atleast and have some good food			
Have you ever been to Ooty 			
I went when I was very young like a child almost so I			
don't remember anything clearly 			
I went just uh this year around June			
 It's a one word place 			
Yeah I heard so 			
Yeah and I			
 It's a nice place for honeymoon couples 			
 One word 			
Uh laughs 			
That is the main you're one word to go there 			
laughs 			
So how do you find the difference from Hyderabad			
Do you find any different 			
And you have been in Calcutta also 			
Yeah I loved Calcutta better than say Mysore or			
Hyderabad that's because uh attachment to the family 			
Not with the city 			
Uh it's both laughs 			
 It's attachment with the place 			
 How do you find it there 			
I found Calcutta very lively city			
Yeah like which do you prefer			
 It's Calcutta or Siligudi 			
No I am basically from Calcutta so I would like to uh stay			
in Calcutta			
No but you spent most of your uh 			
Actually when I was 			
 You were in Siligudi isn't it			
Yeah but we were forced to stay in Siligudi because my parents			
were working there			
But nobody actually liked the place much because we used to			
miss our home our friends uh relatives everybody because everybody			
was in Calcutta			
But how many years uh you were in Siligudi 			
I was there after my birth I spend some four five years in			
Calcutta when I was in uh Siligudi			
That means the entire span			
School life I spent there 			
But still you have no liking for the place			
I don't have really I found it a bit boring 			
Is it 			
I like the place and the activities in Calcutta			
And Calcutta somehow like wherever you go in India 			
it's different 			
 Yeah I mean it's it's city of joy 			
Yeah it is different 			
You can do something or the other and keep yourself busy			
Busy 			
 That's how it is 			
Compare to that even Hyderabad I don't like so much			
But okay in Hyderabad I had the friend circle			
Yeah so we slowly develop			
 So 			
 A few words 			
We could make the place enjoyable well			
Did you watch the match on T V today uh yesterday			
No I couldn't because I was still in the office and this			
is what I miss 			
I think I should get one pocket radio or something 			
laughs 			
But it's so disgusting everytime the team keeps			
losing I mean something should be done isn't it 			
There is something wrong over yeah 			
 Something is going wrong somewhere			
Something is wrong with the yeah Indian team			
I think they don't have that uh team spirit or something			
 Yeah 			
Team spirit that's lacking 			
Because uh			
I mean and that's why they keep losing			
Yeah initially we had problem with uh they			
had problem with all the captains like when Kapil was the captain they			
had problems			
 Very badly 			
They had			
Then other who became the captain they had problems 			
Now they can't possibly blame Tendulkar because he is doing a very			
good job			
Very good job 			
But still they're losing there must be something			
wrong with them like whole team			
 It's high time all of them got together and did			
something about it instead of losing each and every match and 			
We just look forward to those eleven to do something for that			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
So you are interested in cricket also			
Yeah 			
What else 			
Uh I haven't played cricket really in the formal sense			
In college we had a ground where sometimes we used to put on			
gloveses for the heck of saying we were playing cricket 			
In fact the right pose I mean the boy used to carry the bat also			
was never taught but okay we picked up on our own			
But I uh play Tennis and uh Badminton I love the game			
 so it just goes on 			
And what about uh books and music and how do you keep			
yourself busy in leisure time			
I read lots of books only English 			
You know both the languages you have uh edge like			
 uh you know Telugu and Bangla both			
Yeah 			
So which books you prefer reading 			
Telugu and Bangla I am more comfortable in Bangla			
Frankly speaking I haven't read any book in Telugu			
I see 			
So			
So even the Telugu very famous poems are coming out			
now on			
I know never one word 			
You have a very famous uh feminist poet like			
Jayprabha and all so you haven't gone through 			
No I haven't 			
I have gone through but I didn't understand 			
I see somehow I read some of the translated poems of			
Jayprabha and I like them a lot			
Yeah but its sequence are not understanding if you went			
through it in Telugu			
True			
Because my vocabulary is only the limited and the			
 coloquial sort of what you call how much of vocabulary can you get			
at home 			
I understand 			
Outside it was entirely different 			
No I didn't really pick up the language as such but I can			
converse and like that 			
 So when you write to your parents which			
language you write in 			
To my father English to my mother Telugu to my			
grandparents Telugu aunt Telugu			
So you know the written variety of Telugu also 			
The written varieties I write down what I speak that			
should not be one word 			
But don't you find any difference between the okay			
letter writing would be uh would have a different style like it			
won't be exactly spoken variety of a language			
That I have picked up to some extent with the replies I keep			
getting from whoever I had written 			
 Did you ever had paper on Telugu 			
No actually two words have in M A 			
Till your M A 			
So with my one word 			
Okay			
I two words 			
So don't you find it very uhm different like you			
being a Telugu uh using another language and more comfortable in another			
language which is not your mother tongue			
So how do you feel			
How do you take it			
Uh actually uh some thing more like one word			
 laughs 			
Uh I haven't thought about this			
Actually from childhood only I was brought up in the same			
atmosphere like if Papa still has shifted to another place I would have			
got the feeling of not having comfortable in a particular language but on			
the whole I think it doesn't matter exactly how we go about chosing or			
selecting a language 			
So you are really an Indian 			
Thank you laughs 			
What about today evening 			
Okay we might go somewhere no 			
Because if sitting here and uh I think yeah 			
doing nothing is very boring			
 Yeah 			
You are really getting boring yeah and uh as			
far as when I haven't yet started my work 			
 Yeah 			
Even I haven't because I just joined and I have to know			
like what exactly I am supposed to do			
I have got an idea but uh			
Yeah 			
No but that is uh 			
Even uh okay even after office hours like no what else			
 that's true and so we can go somewhere else			
 That's true 			
Make the evening enjoyable 			
So we can go somewhere to eat how do you perhaps			
 like it			
 Perhaps 			
Uh 			
I am thinking about but only certain things I			
mean not all the time so			
Okay I am one word to some extent			
We are usually blamed because people say the girl is 			
uh a few words 			
 A few words 			
Don't talk about like this laughs 			
 It's just food and food and food 			
Seventy-five percent of fair income is spent on food			
But don't you ever notice once like we had a teacher in 			
uh Hyderabad University who used to say like uh for breakfast you should			
come to south and for uh lunch okay you can go anywhere but the			
snacks you should go to Calcutta laughs 			
Because I think she not only came there you can't get			
any where else			
No I remember novels and the chalks 			
see you don't get it anywhere no else beside say West			
Bengal in general			
 No 			
Yeah 			
And famous rasgulla of course			
 Haan 			
You can't get it anywhere else 			
I don't think laughs there is any 			
person who would have not tasted it 			
Are you crazy for sweet 			
 I know one word 			
Not exactly but uh Calcutta sweets I think they do have			
a little flavour and that I haven't got anywhere in India			
Yeah that's it 			
But I tend to be very crazy for sweets than chocolates so 			
 I'm actually I actually go for good food 			
I don't like quantity but quality should be there			
Yeah laughs 			
So whatever it is whichever country whatever preparations I			
don't mind but it should be tasting good			
Yeah tasty			
 That's what matter 			
 But here 			
 Do you have Chinese food 			
Yeah I enjoy it 			
Uh a few words so lousy			
It was not Chinese because the Chinese they never put			
sugar in Chao min 			
Yes sugar in Chao min they put tomato			
Yeah			
I mean I could have made a better preparation			
 That's not a Chinese preparation 			
Half of the people don't know how to cook them no 			
 Don't know how to cook			
And you should go to a typical Chinese			
restaurant			
 But why so that you have lots of these Chinese			
restaurants in Calcutta while its comparatively less less 			
in Mysore or even in Hyderabad why is it so 			
 Less 			
 I do have a feeling that in south specially 			
the people uh do go for their food preparation mostly			
No one word 			
I haven't seen people uh going for other dishes			
No and I think another reason is the percentage of			
people who spent money on outside eating is comparatively less			
 on restaurant than in the north in general 			
Even I suppose the Punjabis and uh the Gujratis also do			
go in for all this stuff			
 On restaurant 			
 Less 			
Yeah they do 			
Uh you know the University			
 A few words as it is			
Of course we speak on one or two words 			
Uh			
So specially when I heard about this Indian English today			
morning I felt uh that uh he did not specifically point			
out uh what exactly is Indian English 			
Because uh in our room there is a Maharashtrian and uh			
there is a Punjabi Kannadian Kannadiga and 			
 we've some of Telugu speaking people 			
But when all of us were speaking conversing in the conversation 			
I didn't find much difference one from the other 			
But uh in the class room situation sometimes uh we find 			
students they're trying to speak in English uh they bring			
in that uh Telugu accent but uh they don't have much to refer 			
Uh when I teach also whenever I teach use the correct accent			
 sometimes I've to come down to their level and uh speak			
otherwise they may not be able to learn from this			
Yes yes 			
They make take up for example word like uh work uh			
 you know unless they spell it sometimes they may not be able to read			
it up even when I read			
 Uh 			
So at that level uh sometimes uh a butler 			
speaking uh somebody who are influenced by people who are speaking			
English picked up words 			
Such people when they are speaking there may be some difference			
in accent or uh their use in the words 			
But generally the educated uh people I don't find much			
variation but in uh accent there may be a variation 			
So what do you think about that variation ?			
Of course I agree with you to so many time 			
But still I think the influence of the vernacular language			
 is there on Indian English 			
For example the latters are not in the habits of 			
pronouncing the for example there is a a a 			
jocular statement also 			
If anyone is going there in the veranda 			
if a a Bengali happens to see him he just says			
like this He's wandering in the verandah			
 			
He won't pronounce the V such a differences may be there			
Of all all the accents			
Accent			
That accent may be different			
Accent may be different but as far as the language and			
other parts are concerned there may not be much difference 			
Only accent and intonation may be different because 			
every individual is habituated to a particular accent and intonation 			
depending upon the vernacular language which he is say have just			
habituated to use from the time of birth till the end 			
These vocal chords should be adjusted in such a way that			
uh they always uh they're in favour of a such a kind			
of particular intonation and accent 			
 That's why the difference if at all is the			
difference is there in Indian English depending on the various			
states in this country 			
It is mainly as you said it is mainly which is not an			
intonation and accent as far as the language part is concerned 			
vocabulary is concerned one need not find uh			
Naturally you won't find much difference 			
So what I wanted to impress upon you is uh the			
influence of English on vernacular languages definitely is there 			
 yeah 			
In even in Telugu sometimes when we use the word like uh			
master yes English word			
 Yeah 			
 Yes 			
But it has come down to the level of uh becoming			
completely vernacular word master			
I know			
So that difference is there and I can understand that			
And the same way these languages uh might be influencing			
English 			
And the Indian writers writing in English especially persons			
like R K Narayan and uh Raja Rao then come down to one word 			
Raja Rao made an experiment			
He made an experiment 			
Even uh R K Narayan was writing he tried specifically to			
bring in Indian humour flavour Indian kind of words in Indian English			
Uh so that way deliberately or unintentionally these people			
might have brought some words of Indianism or Indian words into the 			
literature part 			
But Indian English as it is because whole India is filled by			
speaking English English in India 			
So Indian English as it is gramatically or uh 			
vocabulary wise or lexican uh what you call it 			
Then I don't mind such difference 			
See because uh we were taught only what is the standardise			
English 			
And you know the newspapers magazines so magazines is just uh			
mostly trying to imitate uh American English 			
Specially these uh film magazines or uh the one word 			
Then American English because they are more uh stylish 			
Stylish 			
So British English is easier than			
Easier because they have brought such a changes which you			
which uh which adopt and make you easy			
But then uh another kind of uh people we come across these			
days uh the children special who are taken in uh uh christian schools			
or uh			
Missionary			
Uh urbanised schools say public schools that we all			
know means special group their accent pronunciation is something very			
artificial			
Yes			
You see most note particular group and particular group			
they alone can understands what they speak 			
But in general if they rightly try to speak to other people uh			
those sentences mean their sometimes artifical pronunciation 			
 They're trying to drag a new word in the conversation			
unnecessary accent and something attracting something 			
Means that is another kind of trend which going on			
Going on in all Catholics			
So another thing is uh they isolate themeselves 			
feeling that they are uh quiet superior because they are able to speak so			
fluently that language and American American 			
language 			
So that trend is formed 			
But what I what really to grasp from uh from			
his lecture from this lecture 			
What exactly is the meaning of English ?			
Mean how really it differs from this standardized British English			
or uh whatever you may call it 			
 From his lecture 			
 Nei the language as people say there is			
nothing like real standard because uh people use it as uh I mean			
if you come to Telugu Telugu is spoken in different styles and 			
different ways and though we mannerise literature in Telugu and			
cinemas in Telugu is using a particular kind of standerdised English			
Telugu 			
 Yes there's different styles 			
That way some people are influenced 			
But if you come to a place like uh Hyderabad and it's			
 mostly more uh your accent is completely Urdu kind 			
When you go to Orissa in uh Berrakpur uh			
In Orissa oriya			
Oriya is there completely 			
When you go to Chittoor definitely you'll find the 			
southern influence is there 			
See the word completely one word uh one or two			
words in Telugu in in Telugu we use it 			
 Kannada influence 			
Yes so that dialectical differences you find in every			
language and otherwise the language cannot survive 			
Yeah 			
You heard some time ago as you made it into request			
But what exactly is Indian English ?			
 I'm unable to ring with that 			
Yes of course this is how from his speech we would gain			
 uh I think one word but to uh we can try and analyse 			
Indian English I think it is more identifiable based			
on literature other than languages uh I know correct			
 Uh I know 			
Yeah that's my point			
As far as language is concerned uhm we cannot			
find much difference except this latest information that are going on			
there in in England or in American whose mother tongue is English			
Basically the vocabulary grammar part and all those things 			
 they they remain constant 			
Yet even in those things there may be some slight changes			
because their mother tongue is uh English and they are			
authorised to bring changes depending upon the daily usage 			
 Uhm 			
 English 			
Whereas it is our cultivated language foreign language 			
we are not authorised to bring changes in grammar and all those things			
 That's why we remain as we were 			
Where did you get those uh wood laws entry the grammar			
vocabulary and all those things were uh almost all standardised in a			
particular way 			
Still we carry on those things without bringing any uh			
latest changes 			
As far as the language is concerned that's true 			
But in my opinion Indian English differs completely in			
a way in all literature Indo-Anglican literature 			
That makes all the difference uh about this Ind 			
Indian English 			
Because it cannnot survive without uh literature of course 			
What I think is spoken English			
If someone has uh gradual tone in his speech			
That spoken English			
As far as spoken English			
Spoken English accent will be different some new words			
might have come some of the Indianism might have come in there 			
But basically English language as it is I don't think we			
can go for transform very much to, branding of Indian English as much as			
we brand American English			
American English 			
There is much difference in American			
Because uh they specifically they took a lot of efforts 			
they changed it			
Intentionally they did it 			
Uhm I mean they created their own dictionary 			
Means they don't like to call it an American English they want to			
call it American language			
American language 			
But uh i in America also they have various kinds			
of influence Spanish language you know mean the Negroes going they have their			
own kind of accent 			
So even there the difference is there but uh they are			
identified themselves with American language 			
That way if compared to that I don't find anything uh			
very much significant in Indian English 			
Uh I think Indians pronounce or the accent of Indians are			
much better than the French men speaking English or right yet			
 speaking English 			
 Yes 			
But in the African continent there is a specific uh			
influence of their own language and their own accent kind of English 			
If you read uh article in English novels you find that			
But in India I don't think it has gone to that extent to			
brand the Indian English 			
May be I don't know anything			
Eh no no you are correct totally correct 			
What I'm asking is there's no much uh			
difference as far as the language part is concerned grammar vocabulary and			
all those things are concerned 			
We can't find any difference between English English and the			
Indian English 			
But Indian English English can claim to			
be different can claim to be unique basically literature that is			
these brought out from here because the whole Indo-Anglican literature is			
based mainly of course mainly I have stressed on the			
Indian tradition Indian things Indian culture over whatever a piece			
of creative creative literature that uh so called Indo- Anglican			
literature if you refer to it prose poetry novel whatever it may be 			
basically			
 Of course 			
But there also you have to differentiate uh see if a			
person like Naipaul			
Uhm			
Nobody call him like language might have very much			
lived in the west			
Yes			
Then take another Manohar Mazumdar very much lived in the			
 western west and his writing developing means you			
don't find much of the Indianism 			
Though he treats Indian uh characters in Indian			
English but his language and the flow of language I mean you don't			
find uh anything convertible like R K Narayan ah means			
means they like you let a autobiography of Nehru and autobiography of			
Gandhi 			
There is a vast difference 			
 Nehru's style is something very naturally flowing 			
Okay I am Umarani from Central Institute of Indian Languages

So if any nice experience you had been with there in Tumkur 			
Yes to start with I left Nipani hostel at three 			
O'clock uh and I was waiting for bus in Nipani bus			
stand for for an hour 			
And it was uh different experience for me and afterwards I			
reached Belgaum safely 			
And uh the tragedy started there uhn 			
And I took a Belgaum and Dharwad bus that is beautiful new bus			
infact 			
And it took two two hours thirty minutes to reach Dharwad			
 Uh 			
 Uhn 			
My God			
And I was the first man to go to driver and to scold him 			
because see whether you are a driver or not first of all I asked him 			
laughter 			
He was doing in driving like a lorry no			
Ah ha			
In fact I was the first man to go and ask see what you are			
doing like that			
I think some fat people are there in the bus he thought			
 it's a big luggage is there in the bus so so instead of			
thinking that it's a bus he must have thought that it's a			
lorry			
Yes yes			
Now you said that			
No it was non-stop bus moreover 			
 Just just I went and asked him 			
I was first person to go and ask why you are driving			
like a lorry 			
No sir I am new just an unexperienced man I'd to come			
uh try on this 			
Then just I asked him hey why did you come to uh this one 			
in the night and other things I asked 			
But he replied sir safety is required 			
Safety is required that is for us and not for you			
 Laughter 			
 Safety safety is first than everything			
else comes next yeah 			
You must be facing it but whether it is your place or not			
 Yeah 			
Yeah yeah			
Did you meet Basavaraj that in uh Nandita building I mean			
 you're when we were in degree na we had one fun			
It was a nice thing about Basavaraj 			
He was there 			
So he was very lean personality laughter as if you			
dissecting you'll get only some five to six kilo of 			
flesh 			
 Flesh 			
He was telling one day to my friends he had uh applied			
for this LIC LIC for two lakhs 			
 LIC 			
Two lakhs 			
Two lakhs 			
How can it be man laughter 			
He is not even thirty-eight thirty-five kilo			
Only five kilo of flesh is there he's 			
given two lakhs 			
 Even if we sell it it will around two			
hundred rupees laughter 			
 That's how happened			
And if Dinesh was for two lakhs he was			
telling and that was a beautiful joke we had experienced			
And when you were in degree na did you			
read any of Endumari's novels 			
Of course not 			
Not of course not fine			
I have read I have read			
You have read			
I have read 			
Actually I have read almost all of his verses			
I liked it very much you know 			
So even some of your bright point of your first person as the			
techniques second person every point of your techniques he has brought 			
And uh I think recently in one magazines it's uh 			
on the doom innocent electrical he brought even that uh who your			
Harshad Mehta also there			
He has brought in there 			
Really			
He has expressed very nicely here 			
And in fact when you take up this uh Endamuri 			
Veerendranath's novels it's very thoroughly when you are			
entering to degree or some PG courses			
 It's the real thing that we can enjoy in degree or PG			
courses			
Actually I wanted them to be translated to English 			
Definitely definitely good better and read them laughter			
Actually I don't read Kannada novels			
Is it			
It is			
Then what what novels do you read			
 Then you better read 			
English			
English			
Uh whose novel have you read so far 			
Hardy 			
Hardy you read it as a laughter 			
 You've read hardly you've read it hardly			
Hardly of Hardy's novels 			
So and uh 			
 And uh and that's the fine thing			
In fact uh we have to read those things initially 			
because that should have 			
 First we should read enough uh 			
Yes initially			
We can read our own			
It can suggest it can suggest many ways to read other			
novels English novels particularly			
That the best point of if you'll if we take up			
Endamuri as our model definitely we can grasp enough 			
That was my point of view about Endamuri			
Of course I read others uh Endamuri this one K T Gatti and Satarnas			
also but it's it lacked something 			
Uh but even in English writers you know I read Jacquelins 			
of course though though they are the best sellers 			
I read Jacquelins Susan and Herald Robins and some such			
other			
Supposing your Laurence Sanxaz such novels 			
I've read 			
But not that much general matter is included in their novels 			
There is some plot the hero comes and he does something			
If heroine he goes somewhere and thus they run the villains			
come and it ends there 			
But uh one of her novels as Jacquelins Susan an American novelist			
 I like the novel uh which one that is uh Valley of Dogs			
 in which he said one line beautiful line comes 			
 we all have different sides that we show to different people 			
Uhm uhm			
Ah quite natural idea present my Madam before you anyway			
away and I show some regards to her in different way 			
And uh I've uh my teachers image in me that's			
 it uh they all play the different one 			
So these three will not come at a time			
Yeah 			
 That's why my David is different from the David I			
reference before Prakash 			
Uh that one should not come to know what the other said			
of is my said is enough 			
Then the friendship breaks			
Yeah 			
Oh that's what I think what do you say 			
What do you say Mr David			
David has uh many fine experiences in some or other way			
Definitely definitely definitely from the fair point of			
sex 			
You tell something about uh David 			
Yeah			
Yes somewhat you are saying 			
 You need you need that one you			
know means that I I should be comfortable with his Endamuri Narayana			
No problem laughter 			
No problem any Narayan will do 			
Any Narayan will do for that matter our Narayan will also			
do			
Uhm			
He will give somewhat			
Or Narayan is there is no he gives different sort of that			
altogether			
Yeah			
And some here in never			
No in fact I was adjusting with that since these but I loved			
it 			
To survive			
To survive			
To survive			
Survival of the fittest he is testing 			
So this is philosophical touch			
Yes it does we have we have told and uh Mr David			
 is going to 			
Tell something about his uh native place 			
Should I			
Ah yes in fact			
Please please			
Good it is a nice place Malnad it is called no			
Yeah 			
We have nice weather 			
I see			
 Es especially in Shimoga we have			
Ah			
Uh sand mud and all no			
Yeah yeah 			
You know you you go out uh for walk you'll 			
have a nice uh what 			
Ah			
Nice it's got uh fragrance of this lands and the			
 yeah yeah you can speak well said			
 Yeah yeah 			
And uh so in fact when we have when we have come to			
this PG you no we had altogether different type of experiences here 			
Why that I'll be expecting so I think some said 			
some different kinds of things of PG no when they came she has got so			
nice campus and that day first time when I came here to Nipani 			
Again I lost first period we together lost first			
period of our uh first teacher 			
So actually I was even when I			
 Yeah yeah 			
 What's the teacher			
 A few words 			
 A few words 			
I I heard a lot of things about him 			
Actually first time we went to Sangli 			
There one Professor Pardy is there 			
He called us he of course he would give seat afterwards uh 			
he told that			
Now you go to uh Sangli 			
 Arjunnagar there C T Patil Kulkarni			
 Professor is there you tell him my name to him 			
So influence 			
 Arjunnagar 			
 Kulkarni 			
 Influence 			
 It's not influence because he just he guided 			
They were of course classmate of course friends uh			
colleagues 			
So we came to tell his name here 			
But uh we did not meet him			
He was there was uh on the he was on leave for some three days			
So and we met Professor S T Naik and some other uh Naiks			
we met 			
So laughter 			
Some other Naiks			
Yeah Naiks mean uh they have different meaning laughter			
 Theek hai 			
Teachers Professors 			
So we met the one word participant first class we			
met first period he met 			
Uh he lost that uh first half he was dealing with the			
statement first half seond half we met 			
So on the very day we can recognised definitely 			
this will be first lecture			
 Definitely 			
Because in after all the degree in our degree we had only one			
good teacher			
Filomina Philip from Bangalore 			
Oh yes she was a wonderful lecturer and was giving you know			
She was so wonderful uhm I mean			
 Uhm 			
Uh so wonderful means you cannot explain it her			
knowledge 			
 Ah ha yeah yeah yeah			
 Such a such a nice lady with uh			
affectionate feelings towards the students uh she did all			
And moreover she's being a Christian uhm			
 as we all get			
 Uhm 			
Her pronunciation you know how fast she was pronuncing			
Just like your			
BBC news she was also uh telling everything in the class			
And in fact when I had been to Bangalore the other day			
 I couldn't meet her			
Uhm uhm			
Moreover she was not there and uh I didn't have any time			
to meet her and I came back to my pavilion			
You know it's natural if people go to Bangalore and			
they don't meet laughter 			
She was in Bangalore			
Except except those few those			
The only thing you can't get in Banglore is time time			
 and and of course you can have money also 			
Of course you may not get University buses also 			
laughter 			
Yes yes			
We have plenty of University buses but you won't get 			
It is there it is there 			
You don't go to city bus only for uh reaching your place			
you know laughter 			
You will have to go and search for some seats to sit on it 			
Yes coming back to Arjuna Nagar this thing what what			
 what we were discussing 			
Yesterday no 			
About the college 			
About the college right city college you heard of it			
Oh you was were telling uh			
yesterday you told that he met uh you			
Ah ah I I met him on the way			
Ah yes where where did you meet			
him			
I see			
While going to Belgaum he was in the bus			
surprise visit			
 That's quite surprising			
Yeah there was lot of discussion about this uh waiting			
for Godoth and even Macbeth			
I see that is the thing whenever you meet at whatever the			
time may be you'll listen to his			
And this is this is the relevance of this			
Yes			
Suppose uh this should be there you know 			
Yeah			
If you are dealing with history you should always be kinds of			
 the stretch 			
 Know about history 			
You should have given them situation with your day to day			
life and you should refer to the students 			
Day by day			
So that the relevance will be there 			
There lies the greatness 			
In fact when he is uh dealing with the English literature he			
covers Sanskrit literature Kannada literature			
Greek literature			
Greek literature everything British history everything he			
covers 			
It has nothing in fact and that's why			
As though			
So it was I was unfortunate because I couldn't hear any			
lecture from him			
Ah ah			
Yeah definitely correct			
 That's why we decided uhm to him 			
Of course he said that he would come here			
When he comes here he will inform us and have a			
Yes yes			
 Live discussion on 			
 And then you went to Tumkur did you read			
any this uh did you go to our uh library private library			
This time infact I had programme to go			
In fact I it was not in my programme to go Tumkur as such			
Uhm			
It was to go only Hubli and to Madras			
Ha you wanted to visit many places 			
Yes in fact it naturally once uh			
Oh once uh laughter a few words 			
Yeah yeah			
It has become such that the visiting places is the only			
business			
Definitely definitely 			
It is heard that uh Telephone Exchange at Khadaklat			
has been commissioned 			
And the trunk dial facility or the S T D facility has been			
Extended to all			
Extended			
Uhm			
That uh exchange 			
In fact			
In how many years this programme will continue 			
Uh actually sir now government is trying to trying			
very fast to automize all these exchanges 			
Now there are no manually operated exchanges left 			
Only a few exchanges say I can uh say Athani and in Chikodi			
they are having manual exchange 			
Rest all exchanges are converted into auto 			
Now this Khadaklat exchange is recently connected I			
mean it is uh it was made auto before a few years 			
But now this is connected with S T D facility so that			
people of Khadaklat need not depend upon Nipani telephone exchange			
Telephone exchange you mean			
And uh Nipani telephone operators for getting their calls			
Number of times uh what they find as Nipani do not answer 			
operators do not answer and their calls are heavely delayed and all that			
And since now it is linked with S T Ds subscriber's			
 dialing facility 			
Uh they are much pleased that uh they will themselves dial			
 all the numbers of Nipani as well as uh numbers of any state 			
 of of or of any city they like 			
Question is about uh the system 			
Previously it was the manual exchange so to say 			
Which one			
Khadaklat			
Khadaklat Nipani are these uh the small exchanges 			
were uh automatic exchanges			
Yes sir			
But the big exchanges just like Nipani Chikkodi Sankeshwar			
 sometimes say even uh Kolhapur was also once upon a time 			
manually di 			
Operated exchange 			
 Operated exchange 			
But at this stage means I want to say that automization will not			
 uhn uh uhm what I mean to say is harm the society			
But at the same time what about the staff staff			
and excess staff and other uh facilities that are uh needed			
 Uhm 			
 Staff 			
Especially there are some persons who require S T			
D facility uhm 			
And there are some who do not want the S T D facility 			
So even though they are uh automization still the staff is			
needed 			
 Uhm 			
Yes			
Uhn and here again there is possibility of uh			
getting late connections 			
Sometimes uh no answer no answer like that 			
 one word in what in this connection what your are saying 			
 No answer 			
No sir see when these exchanges were manually operated 			
for all these years there the supposing the exch there are			
about three four hundred numbers in a small exchange 			
Manual operation is just possible by one or two operators 			
But when the numbers increased say to to one thousand two			
thousand so A to B B to C these			
No no I accept I accept your difficulties no 			
or what I mean to say is 			
 No 			
Ahn ha ha			
Now automization is nice thing I accept uhm 			
but there are certain loop holes connect uhm complaints 			
 uhm regarding the telephone bills for example day before			
yesterday I had been in Kolhapur Telephone Bhavan 			
 ah 			
And there one person came and he complained that his bill has			
been uh 			
 Uhm 			
 Loop holes 			
 Uhm 			
 Ah 			
Over excess bill 			
Not excess			
Uhm			
It was too much 			
Too much			
It was about uh fifty thousand rupees 			
And he complained that even though suppose I started the			
subscriber trunk dialing continuously uhm the bill will not			
 uh uh uh will not be of uh such uh great extent			
 Uhm 			
 Come so much 			
So it is a mechanic fault I mean			
 Haan 			
So this connection 			
 Ha yes sir there is every possibility of 			
of having a mechanical fault with a telephone meter as such			
Uhm exactly			
 Haan you see there are clear instructions in			
our directory uh when the automachine is made that uh when the			
subscriber establishes his call and speaks for a minute or two minutes			
 he has to disconnect and see that he does get a dial tone back 			
So that he comes to know that his telephone is disconnected			
from S T D			
S T D facility			
 Accepted sir even though the same thing has been			
 followed properly uhn still your bills			
are so high that we feel that it is better to disconnect the			
telephone connection			
 Yes 			
 Done done by 			
 Uhn 			
Uh ha no doubt uhn 			
This is a very rare case sir			
In that case subsriber got has got every			
right to approach the higher authority higher authority			
department even the court and he does get uh the reembursement of			
all that			
 Uhn 			
 Higher authority 			
But on what ground do you uh settle this case 			
The grounds you see we will test that subscribers			
meter and if he will			
At your end 			
At our end			
But at the same time uhn what I mean to say			
 you may test it but in this case or say in a particular case you			
must call that particular gentleman who has complained			
 Uhn 			
Yes yes yes			
And in in his presence you must check it			
and you must convince him uhm that uh the meter it was faulty			
or meter is correct like that			
Do you have such facility			
And do you such have these actions or			
 His presence only 			
 Uhm 			
No we don't sir 			
In this case we don't call the subscriber but the			
department tests the meter of the subscriber who has got a complaint			
as such 			
And we will in this case supposing now there are automization 			
 is is uh recently started 			
Supposing this had started a year before 			
In that case we send bills every two min uh every two			
months 			
We will see their history of the uh subscriber			
No he says na he says that we have			
brought the bills for the last two years			
Ha two years			
And it was not more it was not more than for three hundred			
 rupees a month say uh for two for a period 			
And it this time it was more than fifty thousand			
Ha if if if that is the case			
subscriber I told you subscriber has got every right to to complain			
No no question of right over here			
And now the now the redressal office complaint is like this			
We will test then meter his number meter will be tested			
 and uh 			
See question is sir whether do you test that meter in			
front of the consumer or the customer			
That is what happens because we he must be you			
may say that our uh our read no you may say that our reading is correct			
 We 			
Uhn sir no doubt uhn			
Because you do not want to take the responsibility of			
your fault 			
See we have got to take the responsibility of			
the fault			
 And that is 			
Do you take it			
See when the metre			
Does the department take it			
I don't think that			
See the department has to take sir 			
 It it will take			
Just see has to take it different and takes 			
 See there is there is one rule			
 in the department sir			
Uhn			
There is one rule 			
Whatever bill is recei received by the subscriber he has			
to pay first the bill			
Exactly what I mean to I want to come to that uh			
Since uh since this this			
 is an absurd bill uhm say of fifty thousand as			
you say uhm which he was getting for three hundred four			
hundred rupees or say a maximum thousand rupees			
 uhm 			
When he receives the bill of five fifty thousand definitely			
 there is wrong something wrong with the meter 			
He has got to uh he has definitely complained 			
His complained will be one word to			
 Uh 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Wrong 			
Uhn without uh asking for the deposition uh of that uh			
amount			
Uhm no in this case here as per the rules he has to 			
 pay fine			
 Pay 			
But uh I don't think the subscriber 			
subscriber will pay fifty thousand			
 He has no one or two words 			
 He will not be in a position to pay			
He will be not in a position to pay 			
Perhaps he has not paid the bill uhm and his			
complaint will be dealt with uhm in in due course			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Now we were talking about auto automization isn't it			
Uhm			
 Cough 			
No doubt this automization has resulted in reduction of			
staff 			
There is a difficulty with us 			
We were about say thirty thirty-five operators in at Nipani			
Since the automization before a year the staff is reduced by			
ten people 			
So ten people are reduced we are now twenty people working 			
Now this are is called uh 			
sma small auto key uh auto key centre			
 Auto key 			
Where each switch are connected 			
They are also automized and linked with S S T D			
Uhm 			
And now the problem with us is there will be no			
booking of of calls at all by Akol Benkihal and uh Khadaklat 			
which are slowing slowly being automized 			
And they will have to deal I mean oh depend on the Nipani 			
 exchange manual operators			
 Exchange 			
And it's manual operater like			
Ha that difficulty is there for us 			
No doubt people are people uh			
No just see what happens no			
Yeah			
They say			
People see people want their facility always 			
Supposing if we get a telephone connection here I mean the			
connection and if we can dial a numeric number in America England 			
or Delhi Japan some any any you definitely you want all			
these facilities isn't it			
 Some any any 			
But uh you don't worry whether there is there'll be			
 autom I mean reduction of staff or something of like that			
You need not bother about it 			
The department has to bother about it 			
The department is now thinking the operators to absorb in some			
other departments and uh they'll be posted to some 			
 to some booths or uhm they'll be taken as			
clerks in the in the various departments 			
that is going on 			
No no I am not to concern about uh your difficult 			
 of course not I am talking of the difficulties of the consumer			
or the customer			
 Of course not 			
 No no I tell you uhm			
 For example 			
Now since the automization is made people are really			
very happy 			
They need not book the call to Nipani Exchange			
And wait for the call and uh depend upon the			
operators 			
 Wait now supposing now the difficulty is that			
 everybody supposing subscriber's at Khadaklat they dial each			
other they'll be getting engage to each other			
 They will they will keep mum for a			
certain while so the only facility is they will dial once again 			
They will dial try twice thrice four times			
Then they will get each other 			
They will you see get the connection they feel very happy			
They are really very happy no doubt 			
Now uh definitely as I say that subscribers are			
What I mean to say			
Ha			
So those who have got there are two ch uhm I			
have two categories in my mind			
Yeah yeah			
One those who are subscribers of that is one 			
uhm with S T D facility			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
Those who have who have got the connections without			
subscribers uh uh S T D S T D			
 S T D 			
Without S T D's there're some pople are 			
 uh see S T D is a subscriber dialing uh facility			
 Uh 			
Ha			
You have got a telephone at home			
Uhm			
When you are out somebody your children or wife or somebody			
 yeah yeah they'll dial the number			
They go on speaking			
Ladies if this start speaking no			
 Yeah yeah 			
Yeah they don't know uhm the technique of using the S			
T D			
I see I see because it is to be used by second to second			
 cough 			
S T D is a facility generally useful for the subscribers 			
who can uh minimise their conversation for a minute or so say thirty			
seconds even forty seconds or a minute also and stop it			
So that previously they were taking the paying say twenty-five			
 rupees for a Bombay call 			
If they finish up you say when twenty-five thirty seconds 			
it is just possible even to speak during thirty seconds forty seconds 			
They get it within two thousand 			
 No I I know this I know this ha ha			
 uh procedure			
 Ha ha 			
Question is those who do not want that S T D facility			
Uh they have to come and book the call			
 Isn't that isn't that and here again the manual			
labour uhn comes into uhm focus 			
picture in the picture uhm			
 Ha uh uh 			
 Uhn 			
 Focus 			
And uh same difficulty will be faced by that subscriber 			
When will you reach uh your home 			
Tomorrow probably afternoon twelve-thirty or one 			
Twelve-thirty afternoon

you had to sit at railway station and then in the morning you			
 Ah reached

So I eat my lunch there close the door I'll			
 have my lunch and then have a little bit of rest and then again			
back to office

Uh no she is breakfast I make it uh initially we			
used to have a girl with us			
Uhm uhm

Since you are going today do you have any friends or

 One or two words

So he came all the way from Faridabad and he had his car			
So he took me around 			
And then it was around eight-thirty there eight-forty 			
exactly we came back 			
And uh I saw Sahu talking to a three wheeler wala			
So I told him are you going there he said yes 			
So I said you wait we'll take you 			
But I didn't know you were here otherwise uh			
He didn't have information you were here			
No I was also not sure I thought I straight away			
Because I remember you told me in the British Council			
 that uh you may not be joining us so			
But I didn't know it will go on upto 			
But it went on for quite it was such a informal			
nice free gathering and uh there was little tension because we			
knew nothing was going to happen today 			
Yeah 			
How many of you were there at one I mean at a time 			
First eighteen 			
 Accha 			
Second plus twelve 			
So thirty all together			
Thirty plus again another twenty-five			
Not forty			
Fifty-five			
Fifty-five 			
Ah			
That lady from Padma Sheshadri School Madras			
Rajalaxmi is it 			
I met her last year			
Yeah I know Rajeshwari			
I met her in Gandhinagar last year 			
 She's good she's really good 			
Uhm uhm			
But uh some of the RPs that they have trained does not			
 uh of of your calibre they does not 			
not all of them are one of them 			
 Such conditions have happened by and large			
But most of them are good 			
Any thing is there produced uh materials which uh do			
not require much uh resource personnel 			
Uhm uhm			
No actually they had also to cover the whole of the			
country 			
So those differences are bound to be there 			
Now I wonder how many people from the north east also were trained			
Uhm			
There are there are many from west side 			
There are many from west side			
Dominantly south and north			
Why was it may be people didn't apply or uh			
No they applied uhm mainly they didn't			
qualify			
 Uhm 			
Mainly they didn't qualify			
Oh accha this was through an interview 			
Ha 			
But I was told I think Nee Nee Neelam told me that			
 there was no interview when she met			
Ha first time we didn't had			
Oh I see accha otherwise			
they chose again 			
 They conducted because of conducted 			
Ha ha			
That they didn't have time and the number of applications			
were of course I			
 Accha so you mean to say eh they didn't			
short list people for interviews 			
They short listed uhm on the basis of uh			
biodata			
 Uhm 			
Biodata			
Then they consulted various organisation			
Uhm uhm			
And then they close 			
On the second and first time commission was set up			
But then who who were on the selection committee			
Uh the obvious British Council 			
Was one word himself there or			
The whole thing uhm uhm

See ultimately what I should like to have is some kind of a			
small group uh with discussion on and conversation to us two or three at			
a time

 You you teach in Guwahati			
I teach in Tejpur 			
 I'm in a college there government college 			
Uh it's near Guwahati 			
 It's about hundred and eighty kilometres three			
hours four hour journey			
Uh ha			
I was working in a E L T R na 			
Ha yes and uh what is his name the E L T centre Professor			
 Sumat Roy Sumat Roy 			
He was the director			
Yeah but 			
That that E L T University 			
 That's the name doesn't ring or			
somebody or			
Varahnika 			
There is a E L T in the			
E L T Centre in the university yeah and the			
director is uh			
 In the university 			
 They've changed him 			
Ha right may be you know the one that I met was two years ago			
Bhattacharjee 			
Bhattacharjee that is it he came to			
 One or two words 			
C I E F L there was a seminar and later in our own			
Kolhapur he had come to Guwahati			
 We've four centres 			
I was working in the E L T I English language teaching 			
And now you are teaching in a college			
 I'm a lecturer in college I came on 			
one or two words 			
 And before that one or two words 			
Hello 			
Hello Lokesh how do you do			
Well I'm fine			
How do you do 			
Fine okay thank you 			
Hello			
Hello 			
Hello you 			
 I'm from Tamil Nad 			
I see			
And I am a post graduate teacher 			
Trained teacher though I'm still uh unemployed 			
uh uhm what is the actual situation PG situation PG unemployed			
graduates are are really a lot of person			
PG graduates in the Karnataka unemployed			
You mean uh unemployed			
Yeah 			
Ah yes of course that's a uh national problem in			
India you know growing unemployment 			
There are uh so many unemployed graduates 			
That is true of uh Karnataka also 			
What do you say Mr Mohan			
Yes I agree with him 			
Uh but with a some difference you know 			
Uh those who have done their MA in English uhm in India find			
jobs easily			
 Haan 			
Though the government uhm there is trying to uhm 			
sneeze they give less importance to teaching of English in 			
schools and colleges			
 Yes 			
Yes 			
So another major problem			
Had you had we studied uh in my case I opted for science subjects			
 you'd have got easily the job 			
But uh any major self-employment project is uh launched			
here in your state 			
Oh yes there are many self-employments schemes			
Right			
Like uh District Industries Corporation industries			
 there is uh one corporation called uh Karnataka State Financial			
Corporation			
 Industries 			
In the district industrial corporation which we call D I C			
 uh you can get a loan to a tune of thirty-five thousand and			
start any small scale industries			
Home industries also			
Yes that's right			
We too have the same organisation 			
We also have that thing			
But when we approach since uh it seems they they uh			
put lot of conditions yes that you fed up with those people			
and uh			
 Yes 			
 Haan haan that is one of the 			
puts a lot of strain that's one of the reasons why these uh			
you know schemes have failed			
 Puts a lot of strain 			
Uh they there are so many legalities uh to perform and			
all kinds of official disturbances well that's true			
Yes I I should say that the Government should take			
steps to liberalise those things 			
 There're so many things which you cannot say bring			
 all at a time 			
Uhm uhm advancing loan uhm but you keep a track of how it			
is utilizing it you know 			
But lot of uh in fact on the government part also 			
sometimes it seems right because in our state more than thirty uh			
three hundred crore rupees have been uh given as			
loan and not a single money has been recovered from the uh 			
people who got it as loan			
Loanees			
Uhm they're not willing to when 			
when they get the money as loans they have the feeling 			
 it's it's donation for them			
Right			
With the result they do not allowance any further			
 uh programmes			
 You you mean to say that they do			
not utilize uh uh			
The funds			
Yes the funds properly 			
Properly uhm because it does not reach the			
man there're lot of brokers ha right there in			
interim period			
It uh the half of the amount goes supposing if they give			
loans for cattles doctors will get some amount or the man who			
recommends and above all there is a fixed limit for uh every village			
So two or three members will be getting right 			
Those who have the influence uh and they'll have to			
 approach back-door way to the local uh ruling party uh members			
 Uhm 			
 Ha right 			
 Right 			
Right 			
Hey even in our state people say it is same 			
But what I feel is as you said the funds are misused 			
Yeah			
You know			
Yeah			
You cannot put all the blame on one party 			
No I			
That is the receiver			
Yeah yeah			
You know			
Of course but uh I don't blame one party			
Then the banks the institutions which have advanced loan			
 have to keep a proper track 			
Right			
Of for instance and see whether the loan is			
being utilised properly			
 For instance 			
Properly			
Uhm and there are considerations also uhm suppose as			
you said in the case of the cattle most of the Indian cattle this			
they die uhm uhm as soon as they are bought laughter 			
you know			
Uhm something should be done means the 			
the basic thing is that we should educate our people 			
 Uhm uhm 			
We should tell them why the government			
 We yes 			
Not only that awareness is created among the people			
Yes that's right awareness is an 			
 as important			
And as you can see uh unemployed graduates have			
become or becoming rather are becoming terrorists anti-social			
elements etcetra etcetra why			
Because of frustrations you know 			
They are frustrated disappointed 			
And proper awareness is not created among them			
Naturally they go astray 			
Right			
Yeah my feeling is but to some extent the			
unemployed unemployment problem could be solved by this kind of uh			
projects though if uh it has proved to be a failure 			
Right			
 A few words 			
What we have got to do is a kind of introspections 			
We should see uhm how how many people uhm have really been			
benefitted uhm			
Why uhm the scheme has been a failure			
So after that say you can revamp your programmes 			
and there is every scope you know uh for say improvement in the			
 yeah scope			
 Right 			
 Yeah 			
But the government does not			
But as far as I think the government should take 			
some hard steps towards those who misuse the funds 			
But you know there are too many uh people interfering in			
it			
Yeah			
Uhm and uh even our few politicians they simply 			
they announce uhn			
And they never keep up their words			
Subsidies uh			
Right			
Yes you don't have to pay ten thousand rupees			
 loan you don't have to pay five thousand rupees 			
loan 			
 And uh 			
 Just for the political game			
Yeah yeah			
We become allured			
Ha right			
That is the unemployed's plight			
Yeah yeah			
And 			
And the government does not			
And once given that should become a tri 			
tradition that's what we think			
Yes yes 			
And that has been happening			
Yeah			
Uh alright uh now what's your plan since you are			
an unemployed 			
Every city two words but the thing is for			
the past years I I did not uh uh concentrate on uh making the			
best use of the modern techniques of agriculture			
Uhm uhm			
The same traditional methods followed 			
And it proved proved to be futile attempt 			
Every year some natural calamities and this and that it			
happens and uh you just you are surviving and we don't seem to			
 have gained any 			
Well uh fortunately for you here is Mr Mohan he is an			
agriculturist a BSc Agriculturist graduate you can take suggestions			
from him			
Yes you are welcome			
I no no			
You can adopt			
I see			
The modern ways of agriculture uhm uhm 			
And if you want say financial help without any say			
 uh mediators and all uhn Mr Lokesh is here to guide you how you			
could get loan uhm			
He only will tell you uh the proper way to approach the bank			
 Uhm 			
I I think we have uh degressed from our uh uh subject			
Infact our subject was unemployment			
And I think this could be one of the solutions you know 			
If uh these graduate people who own lands can go back to			
their lands and right uh adopt new techniques			
 Right 			
Right			
And try to contribute uh to our country in terms of			
you know food food grains 			
Well I think it'll help a lot and uh			
In fact it is a social service also			
Right			
And uh so far people are under impression that white			
collar jobs are the only aims and ambitions in life 			
 That's true 			
So shall we have a cup of tea 			
I think it's better 			
Oh yes yes			
Fine			
 One or two words 			
No not yet it's very hot that			
I see			
In fact when I was uh from my native I could notice			
the difference in climate when we are on the way			
 Haan 			
More than uh two hundred miles across the Salem 			
Uhm I know			
I I was able to notice Salem the difference			
 Salem 			
Is Salem an industrial city			
I think I'm told yeah it's an			
industrial city			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
 It's an industrial city			
 Salem Salem 			
 Industrial city 			
Today I received a letter from my wife 			
She has written it's cloudy there in my place Dharwar 			
but no rains at all 			
No rains			
In Dharwar			
 Yeah 			
 Dharwar

University and see			
Oh yeah you are welcome			
Since you are an agriculturist and since you are uh			
willing to or wishing to implement new techniques and all those			
things all right			
 Okay okay okay

You ask this uh gentleman from Tamil Nadu perhaps him			
 he has not seen any of the important places			
Have you not seen			
Yeah I visited this Palace 			
I see			
That is in Chamundi hills			
Uhm			
But uh that uh KSR dam and uh

By the by I wanted to know about uh this politics in your

the public uh			
Support			
Support but as as an administra administrator			
 I don't find she is really			
 She's losing her popularities			
No not yet still she enjoys it			
 Haan 			
But in the course of time once uh I I I that could be			
 told only			
I see 			
During the course of time 			
Uh as we read			
Because there is no uh yeah equal an opponent to 			
oppose her 			
Right there is no good opposition she has			
almost become a dictator			
 Right no opponents 			
In fact she enjoys the popularity just because there is			
no opposition leader			
Right			
Who merits attention of the public			
Exactly 			
Oh			
Exactly and what about Karunanidhi the former			
Chief Minister			
 That is 			
Yes yes he is not			
Is he completely silenced now			
Yeah at present but ah now he has			
gained slightly upper hand even though one word 			
And totally uh among the number of the voters concerned			
 he's still enjoying the sizeable uh support 			
support

In Madras you have buses for ladies and 			
Yeah we have ladies bus			
Separate yeah			
We don't have buses for male

Only ladies			
Only ladies			
Usually you have 			
 Only the driver and conductor laughter

And they have a special organisation also no 			
 A few words 			
Yeah yeah college students			
Students yeah we have they organise 			
 Yeah we have 			
Like			
These buses are regular or			
Very regular			
Very regular			
I know ever since like when I was studying we had			
this specials at eight O'clock and at one forty they stand			
wait outside our college to pick us up almost like a college bus special			
bus for us 			
That is according to the college times they			
 College time 			
During exams also they will have like that			
Yeah suppose exams			
But they have the other buses also no yeah 			
then			
 Yeah 			
That you have 			
Madras is known for that you know yeah yeah 			
TTB service very best service they have			
 Yeah yeah 			
And every year in the beginning of the year we invite all			
the the crew no yeah like uh outside one forty when college			
gets over around thirteen to fourteen buses to different parts of the city			
 uhm will be standing outside the college			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
Specially our college girl are we give uh a very good			
reason to this people			
I mean we give them a party and we one or two words			
 in your college also			
 Even in our college 			
It is just 			
Oh the WCC they had a one word drivers and the			
 PBC crew and the principal			
So that service is not regular that it has once one or two			
I think 			
But yeah there are so many bus standing outside and then you			
know it is fun 			
Sometimes the bus are almost empty no like yeah 			
the one word 			
And like that one we had a bus in Adiyar we have a bus 			
 Yeah 			
And it is not necessary no you can have the same			
bus which passes through Adiyar to Tirvani but we have to see			
almost empty 			
 Same bus 			
But anyway it is very comfortable oh yeah 			
and also in buses here in Mysore also 			
We have the first half for men and the second half for			
women Hyderabad also it is like that			
 Oh yeah 			
 Even in Hyderabad 			
Now they have uh introduced before it wasn't like that			
 uhm uhm and still there is a problem people means they come			
and sit on the ladies seat and they won't they get up			
 get up 			
We have a lot of quarrel			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Get up 			
That they won't do never they will do in Madras you know			
 even if they sit they'll get up			
Yeah and when they			
Now they have			
But one thing			
We have got used to it I think only then recently some			
two months back I think 			
Uhm uhm and in Madras suppose the men are sitting in the			
ladies seat ladies have to go stand next to them they will get up			
 They'll get up			
But the ladies who are sitting in the men's seat and			
they won't get up			
They won't get up laughter 			
So the men must be standing but these people they			
 They get irritated you know they get irritated			
The other seats are only for men then			
Yeah this half for women this half for men			
Oh that's 			
Uhm			
What about children ?			
 Laughter 			
It is as if very big bus			
No no but then where will they sit 			
Anywhere			
Anywhere			
They can sit anywhere 			
But this system is better no one half			
Of course yes that is yeah			
Because then the in Madras what happens standing uh 			
 that place is common 			
 It's there but it's common no 			
So			
 It's not there 			
Uhm yes			
That really is a problem 			
The buses will be crowded 			
Yeah very crowded

We have many students from Vellore and I they have come to			
about ah ha city			
 Aa ha 			
Ah yes

I enjoy my teaching in school because I studied in the			
same school			
You studied in the same school and you are			
teaching in the same school			
Ah it's very enjoyable then no laughs			
 Yes same school 			
 Yes I am teaching in the same school under			
my teachers 			
Now the headmaster is my he's was my teacher 			
He was your teacher and now he is your colleague			
and boss and all			
 yes 			
Everything just like 			
 You're going to settle down in Vellore itself ?			
I hope so 			
It is only a tentative uh what can we say 			
decision tentative decision			
 Decision 			
We have not yet decided what to do next 			
But of course it is a little bit tough for me to go travel hundred			
miles every every hundred kilometres everyday and do my work 			
Are you going to teach English after this course ?			
Uh sometimes they my school utilises me			
Oh			
In the absence of English teachers 			
Sometimes they give a kind of uh what can you say the			
training to the teachers who are not good in grammar 			
At that time they'll call me to give to deal with one			
chapter 			
Any chapter or any topic on grammar 			
 Anyhow it'll be helpful to you			
Yes yes they will do it 			
Had you been to any other state other than near Andhra			
pradesh and Tamil Nadu and even now Mysore I think			
Uh only to Madras			
Only to Madras			
Only to Madras			
Not to any other state 			
Uh no 			
Do you stay in Andhra for sometimes 			
Sometimes when I was a child I was taken to that			
place 			
After that my grandma was old			
My mother passed away			
So we had no connection with those people 			
More than that almost all the people became very old at that			
time laughter so we had no connection after that 			
Now you are the resident of 			
Vellore			
Tamil Nadu Tamil Nadu that is Vellore			
 Tamil Nadu 			
Yes 			
How do you do in the vacation ?			
Like summer vacation or winter vacation ?			
Uh			
You may be getting more than three months I think 			
Not three months 			
But used to coach the children			
 Use to improve them 			
Oh you know what the coaching facility is like			
Yeah 			
In summer before I before I came I was teaching the			
students 			
Sundays I took intensive classes for the entrance			
to twelfth standard			
 Intensive 			
For those who are going to write that twelfth			
standard yeah we've to			
 Twelfth standard 			
Uhm I don't feel so we are left free 			
Everytime we have some work to do 			
 what do you do in pooja 			
vacation ?			
 Pooja vacation also we used to conduct some			
classes practical classes 			
So they question us when these children fail 			
So many things are there			
Oh all this schools are utilising the vacation to			
Sometimes 			
Even when they are teaching to the students or except 			
teaching to the students 			
 Yes yes 			
In pooja day some important days we stay			
back 			
Some other days we have our own work 			
So we will we want to finish our syllabus so we run to school			
 or do the work			
Now how do you find your life as a teacher ?			
Yes I like I like it very much			
Formally I was not liking it 			
But uh I I developed to a liking over it 			
Now I like it very much 			
I like this 			
I like to be with the children 			
Yeah really then			
So whenever I come to school			
There one or two words even to provide fun to us 			
laughter 			
Yes when I am once when I am in the school I'll			
 not think about anything any type of uh 			
You forget all your worries all your laughs			
 Yes yes 			
Everything no worry there 			
When you look at the children			
Yes 			
Once we come out we'll come out with satisfaction 			
Otherwise if we don't if I don't teach means I will be feeling			
very sad			
Today I have not taught this others have done this well 			
uh so many things will be there			
Anyhow you have to seen see your			
own			
Yes definitely definitely			
Performence in the class 			
Yes yes			
 That's good 			
So I like this teaching also uh it's an I as I			
told in the class in the it is an a very			
good experience what we had in teaching practice			
How do manage your home and your service at the same time ?			
Ha it was bit it was difficult only 			
 It's even though how do you find it ?			
So I took it as a challenge			
Yeah 			
Uh I know very well that life is uh not smooth life is			
made up of a uh troubles 			
So if you want to accept do adjustment 			
 adjustments and uh 			
You have to do adjustment			
Ah yes I I remember one quoting quote			
 from Nehru if you want to accept uh a full blown rose			
 we you have to accept the thorns behind it 			
Oh laughter 			
Oh uh I am very happy to have met you rather 			
Yeah 			
Uh uh I uh can't spell it a kind of pleasant occasion			
Yeah surely it's a equally a pleasure for me 			
that I met you			
Oh thank you very much sir 			
Uh so it's uh I can say a few words about an			
institute where I have been 			
Yeah please let me know something about the institute 			
where you worked 			
 Uh yeah yeah uh that's what I			
understand that people I was under the impression that uh almost for			
the educated people are aware of Birla Institute of Technology			
 I'm one word as it's quite			
reputed one			
 Yeah 			
You are right 			
But I understand some of our participants who have			
been here are not uh as much aware of the institution as I expected			
 rather			
Well for myself atleast I I'm 			
Ah accha thank you			
Yeah uh it's in fact a kind of unique institute			
 in the sense I say that uh it in fact uh motivates the students 			
in such a way that they become quite uh uh what what			
 should I say is acquiring a sort of managerial quality 			
with which they are able to sell themselves that are in the market 			
 field uh uh			
 Yeah 			
Now-a-days the sad story about other universities and uh			
higher education institutes is that the products uh do not come out very			
well equipped 			
And they flood the market there are no job opportunities for			
them			
Yeah yeah			
But uh products who come out of your institute 			
yeah are really absorbed			
 Yeah 			
Yeah sure 			
And uh for yeah quality goods there is always a			
demand yeah one should say 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah sure 			
And more over they take a kind of uh national cream I must say 			
And uh half of the credit goes to rather saying that the			
institute is able to provide something to such an extent that each			
brings that there I must say uh they've become quite fit to			
the society			
But basically they are brilliant students when they come to the			
institute			
Because uh they input I would say that are really			
brilliant uh they score above ninety-three percent 			
Based on their merit they get into the institute yeah			
 uh			
 Yeah 			
Uh it's not only that uh the best students come to this			
institute			
Yeah			
They are also given the best kind of training			
Yeah that's there 			
Yeah			
Uh but the best kind of uh			
 I wish I wish there were more institutions			
of this type			
Yeah 			
Uh in the country			
Yeah			
Unfortunately there are only just one or two here 			
 yeah to be counted on finger's end like an island			
 Yeah 			
Yeah laughter 			
You know sea of mediocrity 			
You know it's good that though the institute has			
been in Rajasthan uh I would say that it it's in fact a kind			
of oasis 			
Yeah oasis 			
Uh I was quite surprised to see how in that uh desert			
atmosphere uh uh G D Birla was able to establish such a great institute			
 uh which in fact has become popular at the international level			
rather			
Yeah 			
And moreover I understand when our students uh come			
to the third level which we say third year rather when they come to			
the third year their attention is mainly towards preparing for GRE			
 and get out of this country 			
Uhm that's rather unfortunate			
Yeah			
Because we spend so much on them and the best mind 			
the best talent the best energies of the country flow out of it 			
 yeah 			
 It's a pity that India doesn't get the benefit out of			
these uh the best minds the			
 Yeah 			
One way we have to accept this also this India is not able to			
provide better opportunity uh to their expectations rather 			
So and I am very happy still the students uh foreign			
United States of America uh they are quite uh grateful to the institute			
 uh the what to say is to their almamater 			
And they come forward voluntarily to see that the institute 			
still further developes 			
And uh I understand a few students have given a sort of a			
statement to the authorities that uh they are collecting some amount			
 which would in fact uh update the computer centre 			
Uh its quite uh remarkable approach on their part I feel 			
Uhm I wish not only would such an institute be updated 			
but more such institutes were uh started in other parts of the country			
 so that uh all the regions stand to benefit 			
Yeah			
And the country as a whole yeah uh progresses			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
But in that sense I say that I see in Pilani			
 I must say all the states a country a country in			
Pilani I could see			
Uh			
Uh national integration rather			
Yeah yeah			
Uh I could experience			
Yeah 			
And moreover the students are highly disciplined I must			
say 			
I was told by then I wasn't there 			
But even at the time of the Mandal Commissions I I could			
understand that all over the country the students were on strike 			
But uh that was the only institute which was functioning			
Where there was no disturbances			
No not at all very kind ah not at all			
 Very kind 			
And uh the students you know because they are much 			
uh motivated uh towards getting trained with which they will be			
able to get into better industries 			
And one more good thing I would like to say about our institute is			
 we have a practice school system			
Uhm			
Uh with which in fact they're able to give the			
better training to the students and they are able to expose their better			
products to the country rather I would say			
I see 			
Uh			
 Haan 			
See we have a practice school system in such a sense 			
uh a practice school training running of about four months at the end of			
the second year uhn 			
And uh they got to go to they have to go to different			
industries where the students are expected to go and do			
some industrial training but this does not mean that they can go alone			
and do away with some work and get and report that they have done			
the report that they have done some industrial training or something it's			
 not 			
When they send the students they are sending the faculty members			
also to look after 			
 Uhn 			
Uhm 			
Uh this programme is going on for about in eighty			
centres all over the country 			
Eighty centres eighty centres are there			
 Eighty centres 			
And we have practice school too running of about six			
months 			
And I understand there are for about thirty faculty members 			
are staying outside to look after the students			
I see 			
All the care for the students in a way and looked to their			
 academic upbringing in all possible ways so that uh they			
turn up to their best uh lot the best products of the			
educational system that uh exist in the country 			
No I would say that uh in fact the system of education			
uh that's there in this Pilani I would say that it is quite			
application oriented			
Oh I see			
Uh how it would be quiet useful to give a kind of life			
skill for a student			
But elsewhere we don't have this application approach at all			
Yeah			
 It's only a theoritical approach and most of			
the students who come out of these institutes have only a theoritical			
background and in the practical world yeah they			
are not much of a success			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah you take for example uh I belong to the Department			
of English			
We have MA honours in English 			
But when I say that we have MA honours in English it doesn't mean			
that the subjects taught are purely confined to only the literature			
field 			
Oh			
See for about first two years the respective of any			
disciplines they are exposed to common these common subjects 			
Uh			
A student who is admitted in MA honours in English he			
will be exposed to thermodynamics I see will be exposed to			
computer science 			
 He'll be exposed to physics uh and			
chemistry			
 I see 			
 Uh 			
Uh			
So irrespective of any discipline a student who is			
admitted in uh computer science will be doing the same course of the			
student who has who has who has been admitted into			
 MA honours in English			
Oh I see 			
So they are exposed to Compulsory Disciplinary Course			
We call it CDC only when they come to the third year 			
Ah right again it is a sort of			
interdiscipline			
 Again 			
Interdisciplinary that's why they call it first			
integrated degree			
Ah 			
One cannot uh I should say one should be 			
should be happy to see such an institution having been			
developed in some part of the country if not in our own part near			
our home 			
And uh I should compliment you on			
Oh			
Being on the staff of such an institute			
 Laughter 			
Thank you sir			
Uh it is not everybody's lot to be 			
Yeah in that sense			
A part of such an institution			
Yeah I'm really happy though I'm quite away			
from my home town 			
I am very happy that I am working in an institute which is			
known for an academic excellence			
Yeah			
And the students are very bright so we have got a kind of			
job satisfaction that's there,,			
Uh uh though there are a kind of advantages and disadvantages			
 as far as my personal point of view is concerned 			
But as an academician I am really happy			
Yeah we have such an ethos			
Yeah uh ethos and academic excellence exist one			
really feels one is previleged to get in there apart			
from uh job satisfaction			
 There 			
Yeah 			
Though I was not uh as happy as I am now			
Now I consider it as a kind of blessings in disguise			
Yeah really yeah one should			
 Yeah 			
Yeah when I left Madurai where I had been working uh			
I in fact was not at all uh willing to go to such a place which is			
quite a far off from my place			
Yeah			
But now I don't have that uh feeling what should I call sense			
a hallucination uh I'm not I'm			
 not at all suffering from that 			
 Uh 			
Uhm you are all saint of the country so to say laughter			
And uh one more thing I would say that uh students have			
been in BITS Pilani are uh quite more in number from south			
rather			
I see oh that's uh yeah rather			
strange			
 Yeah 			
Yeah that I would say is truely beecause uh the			
admission takes place is done merit 			
I am very happy to say that there is not even a single seat			
 for the chairman of the institute			
Oh			
 It's really remarkable 			
Yeah 			
Uh uh they don't interfere in the admission process 			
and even if the Vice-Chancellor's son gets 			
point point point one percent less than the			
percentage that is fixed that is the set marks for the admission as for as			
that particular year is concenred			
He also has to be out 			
Oh that's really remarkable 			
We don't see this kind of a thing elsewhere 			
See everywhere else in the country people in position's			
 of power and authority try to manoeuvre			
Yeah			
The the admissions uh even the academic grades that			
are given 			
Sometimes the professor's son or daughter himself or			
herself get the gold medal though they might have not even 			
ordinarily got a second class let alone a first class 			
So we have heard many such stories from elsewhere 			
But in at Pilani such a thing a really exists one should			
be happy as well as proud uhm also of such an ideally			
ideal institution			
 Uhm also 			
Also it's quite a known for cultural festivals			
They celebrate a festival called Oasis			
 which is once in a year 			
And the students are given enormous freedom and they collect			
the funds from different sources I mean many firms are sponsoring 			
And they are able to uh going out the function called			
 Oasis in such a manner that it is uh uh what to			
say uh known and famous at the national level 			
What one or two words uh I mean the management			
of the institute is allowed to keep for the best available in the			
country to their students to their alumni 			
They do not spare any kind of effort 			
Of course the these cultural festivals are organised by			
students themselves			
By students themselves 			
Yes it's they who collect the fund 			
it's they who collect fund organise			
 It's they who collect fund 			
No doubt about that all should give a kind of better training			
for the students this is what I should say			
And uh moreover sir uh though the students are prepare to			
soil their hands anywhere it's not the case with supposing			
somebody gives the training in the name of MBA graduates or whatever we			
also have got a degree programme called MMS 			
And the students who come out with a degree MMS I understand			
that there is a report that has been received uh from different firms 			
that the students of BITS Pilani specially MMS candidates they are			
prepared to soil their hands 			
They are prepared to do any kind of work			
It is not that they demand AC room they will be sitting only in			
the AC room they will be able to only manage the sub-staff it is not			
the quality 			
If the situation warrants they are prepared to do any sort of			
work or they are prepared to go the field 			
Yes it is that kind of uh service motivation			
Yeah			
And uh committment to work that we should instill in			
our students 			
Instead what we are producing these days is uh 			
brown sahibs 			
Those who want to be uh in offices which are air conditioned			
Those who do not want to soil their hands 			
Those who want to think themselves the upper crust of society			
 born they heavenly born one word so to say			
Yeah			
To rule the country 			
To rule over others 			
And this is unfortunate

 That's the problem 			
Uhm			
But you don't face problems			
No most of them are working in fields and uh farms			
in the villages 			
Uhn when are going to get married Mr Shellroy ?			
Don't think of marriage just now laughter 			
Uh no you must get married because now you are twenty-six or			
twenty-seven it's time to marry			
I think that you should relax enjoy life the full			
You know do you think that marriage uh after marriage			
you cannot relax			
No I think you've once we get married there are			
more responsibilities			
Uh			
So I like to do a lot more things before getting married			
 A few words 			
 So like for example Diploma 			
But I have decided not to get married at all 			
I have resolved not to marry at all			
Oh don't do that 			
You need company laughter 			
No we can have company no in our group			
 Let's get let's get the opinion of a			
married man 			
Yeah what is in a marriage ?			
Uh yeah talk about this uh marriage and uh celibacy			
That means uh			
Celibacy			
 He's not exactly laughter 			
You might not be you might not be married and you may not to			
be a celibacy 			
Yeah yeah			
Forget that thing			
What I mean is uh there is no pleasure without married			
life is it ?			
Very good you are the one exception you are the only one			
Oh sir I didn't one word 			
There are difficulties and uh problems start only when you 			
 uh get married			
 Problems 			
No I think uh we have some one else to take care of 			
when we have children one word children to take care of			
There are lots of problems but yet 			
Uhm			
Wonderful			
Married life you've got uh precious			
But I feel			
But uh yes yes			
I think people after getting married giving			
birth to children I'm going to school this thing that thing so			
many problems			
 Because 			
So many problems and then so many expenses			
The problems are there but also there are pleasures in the			
married life in the family life whereas in celibacy you			
don't get pleasures 			
That you can remain 			
I feel free now 			
 without problems uh			
I I feel free now			
You may have got uh problems			
I am not tied I am free			
Yes no problems 			
 I think there is uh this there is the			
pleasure in sharing in life			
Sharing it with some one else			
Companion			
I am sharing my thoughts ideas with you			
Yeah and when you get married 			
You come into a close relations and uh connections with so			
many uh relations of uh on your side on your wife's 			
side 			
 From wife's side 			
So many people coming to contact with you 			
And you face a 			
Lot of problems in the list of problems			
You get joy 			
But I don't know			
But I think sir it all depends on how your wife is 			
Suppose you get a okay understanding wife is okay			
But suppose you get a different kind of wife a nagging wife from			
the some one who just can't adjust with you			
Yeah			
Then marriage is not the			
Then even you will be segregated from the society you			
relatives as well as uh friends 			
Always you must be 			
You might be lucky sir			
You must be optimistic			
Oh yes yes yes			
You should not think that you will get a nagging and uh			
obsessive uh such kind of wife you get you should not think			
Next thing 			
People say that must you get me educated ladies atleast a graduate			
or post graduate what is there in it all are woman 			
No graduation post graduation or it's all			
goes to help someone who can understand us who can vibe with us 			
For example okay we have done our MA and all that suppose			
we do get married with someone who is not having any education 			
There is a total difference between us			
So you may not exactly have a better a good understanding			
My my father is an MA my mother did not see she			
couldn't write at all 			
They adjusted they had a very good life			
That is the matter that's what even my wife 			
uh she is not a graduate 			
 Uh you what what your			
She is not a graduate 			
See the harmony of uh marriage uh or married life uh is			
not in education or not in other things 			
Or one word money or uh it uh depends on the			
understanding between that is likes and dislikes 			
Both of them are seperate one or two words 			
I think we stop talking about marriage 			
There are two unmarried people laughter 			
You are the one married a few words 			
You may not uh think that uh only the educated and uh			
 people who are working or earning are highly educated 			
They alone can uh live happily otherwise all others 			
But on the other hand my both brother and my			
sister-in-law are both are educated 			
They have problem			
Even now everyday quarrel fight what to do			
 It's all wife thinks a few words educated			
as			
So why should I 			
Yeah how many in your uh how many members in your family			
are uh post graduate ?			
Uhm two or three your myself and my brother			
 Your 			
Your father ?			
Father he was Post Graduate			
What is he ?			
Uh nothing he is a business man doing his uh farm			
Oh oh I see and you are the younger son 			
I am the youngest 			
Youngest son			
 A few words 			
Ah so how about going for a movie you see 			
Interested in going for movie lot of Tamil movies is going on			
No your Tamil movies are one or two words 			
No there are some so many			
You see see movie ?			
Normally I don't I don't go to movie 			
I don't go to movies at all			
Why ?			
Because he is married			
 I'm not I've not been used to it because in			
my family others are going but my father because my mother being uh			
that is one word 			
In fact there is a one word he is doing so			
Okay 			
Have you all that cultural entertainment a few words 			
that we have youngsters make it a point to see every movie that comes through			
Not only entertainment it is it has became some what 			
uh a must isn't it ?			
Yeah a few words peoples in theatres 			
especially in Madras when it's hot you go to theatres just			
for that one word that's how we feel 			
Okay too hot a few words 			
Okay theatre going it is sometime we can have a nap there			
In Madras to go and see a film we need to spend a lot of			
money for per persons yes ten rupees 			
fifteen rupees 			
 Yes 			
Uhm			
Normally in Madras approximately atleast thirty 			
rupees to go out to see a movie and come 			
Very expensive per persons			
And if we take a family 			
 It'll go to hundred like a family one word			
 advantage and disadvantages of it 			
 But normally after the uhm T V programme			
 uh coming to a the normal use and we don't find people going			
to cinema so what do you say ?			
See doordarshan is nothing much probably			
Sunday evening you have to watch a movie			
 A few words 			
Uhm every Sunday two or three uhm films either in			
Tamil or in other languages 			
Ah yeah yeah they spoil story			
Uhm 			
You know only			
Uhm two or three films every Sunday I mean Hindi film uh			
there are and now that uh cable TV and other uh STAR TV 			
That is a bad influence			
Uhn			
That is a bad influence			
That is coming to 			
You see this is the whole day spend on watching something or			
the other spoils education			
I think children shouldn't be allowed 			
There are many precautions 			
Some problems that arise for example family relations are			
 uh there's not there's not that family inter-relations			
 because before when people used to sit together and talk 			
Okay father mother children the relations 			
whatever is on the TV they just sit to watch TV and there's not much			
of communication between them 			
That is what			
 The relations 			
Yeah no understanding 			
 There's the family relationship gets spoiled and they			
get dispute I can say and collide something like that 			
What about in your house do you you are these having			
any			
Uh we don't have any			
Younger brother or sister			
It is almost			
Younger brother and younger sister in your house ?			
I have never been at home for two days			
You not got TV at all			
No TV at all for my father is so strict that we didn't had a			
TV because its one word 			
Oh very nice 			
Yes I am from Kerala 			
 I'm Kuriachan 			
I am working as a teacher in a school 			
Yes sir I'm Anthony 			
I am Joy Joseph from uh Kottayam Kerala a central part			
of Kerala and uh I am here on a special uh session 			
And uh you one word last week when uh you came			
from your own place from the			
Yes yes I came from uh Nelambur			
Nelambur			
Uh			
Oh then Nelambur comes somewhere in the northern part			
Ah northern part of Kerala			
Northern 			
But it is a border district I believe			
 It's border district			
Between Karnataka and uh 			
 Between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu			
Oh I see 			
So I'm teaching there uh in one of the uh			
private college			
Uh ha you teach in some uh higher secondary school			
Yes I teach in in some higher secondary 			
But basically I am a mathematics teacher but uh in my school I			
teach uh English			
Oh ho ho it's fantastic job you are doing no 			
 It's it's a rainy season in our			
place and we have plenty of rain this year so our crops uh			
agricultural crops are very good 			
Then what about you sir uh in your village is it a village			
or town ?			
Yes it's a village 			
 It's village			
Not uh big town a small town 			
 What's the main cultivation there ?			
 It's paddy and then uh rubber			
 rubber and uh maize that's all			
 And 			
 Rubber 			
Uh in our place no uh the main cultivation is rubber 			
Usually in Ke Kottayam is supposed to be the I mean uh			
 a place where you have we have maintained that uh uh			
So you get uh more income			
But you know the pro uh recent uh trends because			
now-a-days more over though the labour charges have gone up now the good			
prices are not coming			
 Oh that's everywhere in Kerala we			
can't uh			
 That's it			
But the only advantage			
We can't help it because the population			
Only advantage is that uh rubber is now enjoying a basic			
price or something like that in a fixed price which is uh almost good			
Not that bad			
So but actually we still remember the day one word 			
years till a few years back Kottayam was one of the most affluent the uh			
places even in the whole of India 			
Yeah that's right			
And you know educationally culturally by all means and			
you know uh or uh our area I mean the who the whole place			
 it's almost cultivable cultivated and uh we have access by roads			
 trains and one word 			
So we cannot say that it is in a one word 			
We have a stationary ways etcetra etcetra			
Uh ours is a remote area and our people uh			
yes hilly area			
Our people they are mostly depend on this agricultural products 			
uh like uh pepper paddy uh then coffee coffee seeds uh tea			
plantations 			
These are the main crops we we 			
 Hilly region 			
You have			
Yeah we have 			
And uh educationally our area is very backward			
Ah uh 			
Because most of the people uh migrate to from southern			
part of Kerala 			
But they must be uh be belonging to some I mean uh			
good I mean families no 			
They a few words we don't have enough uh facilities			
 for education and or plant rotation 			
 Facilities that should be arranged 			
 One word is there 			
And uh a very good percentage of our population is uh			
 uh tribe 			
So they are backwardly you know they are educationally and			
socially they are backward 			
Actually they don't want to live with us 			
They want uh their own lives as it is			
Ah I still remember I was told by some social workers 			
that whenever the people uh responsible people go to the uhm tribal			
people they are show their uh uhm what to say uh unwillingness to			
come forward to mingle with the main stream etcetra is there			
Yes yes			
Now there are various projects I think to give them for			
 a main stream even then you know I personally don't uh uh agree			
with many of the policy because you know one way we are destroying their			
natural habitat			
 Yes uh there are uh yes 			
Uh where they are used to			
Yeah			
Yes that's true that's true			
And you know the days are gone when we could see we could			
think of uh people bringing honey etcetra from the forest and			
Forest and uh they had a very good life			
Ah yeah they have their own cultural I mean we destroyed			
everything anyway whatever it is			
So one way it's a good I mean when we think about uh			
this one of government policies are concerned government have to bring			
all the people to the main stream or whatever it is and uh uh what			
time you have come ?			
Uh today			
What about your job and uh family in Nelambur sir ?			
Yes uh as I told you everyting			
You belong to that particular district			
No no I belong actually to uh Yernala district			
Oh ho from Yernala			
You see I'm settled in Nelambur			
Uh then how do you a few words work 			
Yeah my field of work is uh I teach I told you know I was			
I am teaching in one of the private colleges 			
You see we don't have uh it's run by you 			
 it's run by me			
 It's run by you 			
Ah ha ha			
We don't have uh many regular colleges or any high			
schools run by the government or recognised by the government and			
nominated 			
 It's a migrated area			
Yes so this a boon your step it's a boon to			
your uh progress and your people			
In a way you can say			
You provide certain education facilities for them 			
Yeah uh see I am actually running a parallel college 			
A parallel college			
Yes ah a parallel college			
And uh who else is there to assist you some other teachers			
or employees			
Ah to assist there some teachers are there and uh together			
we conduct the classes 			
And there are many people uhm many people 			
because since there are no recognised uh aided uh colleges and schools uh			
many in our area 			
You see this parallel colleges they run a group			
 Uhm 			
Yes of course			
But still I have a doubt uh 			
Actually these parallel colleges uh are the main reasons for			
the uh melting of so many graduates in India 			
And uh actually they create a lot of problems uh in unemployment			
uh			
And uh after getting education they don't want actually to do			
other work other work uh like uh what uhm you call 			
aga agriculture			
 Other work 			
Yes especially the Indians have the uh uh			
tendency to keep away from parrallel work and uh			
 Tendency 			
Ah parallel work yeah 			
Everybody wants a white collar job			
White collar job			
Yes this uh			
 It's a big problem 			
So we have uh what you call this uh unemployment problem 			
uh in our uh place in plenty			
So people wanted to go abroad in search of jobs 			
Not only in your place everywhere in India these			
these unemployment problem			
 Ah yes uh 			
The tendency to			
So they seek job in other countries 			
But uh to go abroad uh it is very difficult one or two			
words because uh the problem of language the financial			
background everything comes in the way 			
Uh uh when we talk about these things uh what do you feel			
about the standard of English 			
Is it necessary these English education is necess is			
it necessary in our country ?			
So that's a one word I'm a strong			
uhm arguer for the main maintenance of good standard of			
English throughout uh across this life			
Yes yes			
 Because because the reason is			
that it's a world language you know and			
And uh and uh language see in India in particular if a			
country like ours we need uh what you call a link language			
Because uh our country has a multi uh 			
lingual background lingual background			
 Lingual background 			
Every state has uh their own languages so in order to			
communicate with them uh I think			
We must have uh a			
Link languages and we usually depend on this English			
Or in other words uh if you don't know English if you			
want to communicate with people from other cities you need to know around uh			
ten fifteen languages 			
Whereas if you know English you could serve I mean it could			
serve your purpose throughout India and even outside the world			
But actually the politicians spoil the one or two words			
 I think so 			
Yes they actually spread the regionalism communalism and			
all			
Because they have uh their own uh motives you know 			
They have their own personal motives uhm they have to 			
stand for I mean their survival			
Uh their survival 			
And uh once such issues are out of the scene uh they cannot			
 have any thing to to go to the people uhm I mean again for			
something else or so 			
So I think there are two sets of people I think 			
One is favouring uh this uh English language and there are			
other people who are			
Those who're against them			
Against them			
Yes that's true 			
But when we consider the facts uh we are supposed to follow			
 this English language as long as uh we have another link language			
Link language yes 			
 That's very important			
Important 			
But not only that for our higher studies uh purposes 			
 One word 			
If you want to go through any material this is			
the only uh language by which we can communicate			
Uh I mean uh we'll get the only material in English			
In especially higher upper higher school higher			
level 			
 Upper higher school 			
What about the cultural uh uh background in your place do			
your people still uh maintain that uh traditional cultural programmes 			
like Kathakali Turgal etcetra in your place ?			
Yes they do 			
But even they are on the decline no			
It is very you know in our place you know many of the items			
are not uh there 			
But it is because of the influence of this uh city culture			
you know 			
They are always after these uh so called modernism 			
Yeah that is the inevitable reality for example in our			
childhood you know even uh my own I mean the school where I studied			
our I mean usual uh uniform was the very much traditional Kerala			
 mundu and uh shirt 			
Now most of the schools in have changed to uh uh one			
word 			
But I I feel it has become an inevitable uh 			
That truth uh and we blindly follow the tradition of			
uh European people uh 			
But does this mean that you know			
My sir I mean my guess is that you know people must have uh			
 chosen a convenient way rather than uh 			
No I don't think how can it be a convenient way because 			
uh wearing these uh boots shoes ties			
 It's a one word you mean uh that 			
it's not at all suited for Kerala's climate uh 			
One way it's true			
 It's not hygenic especially during the month of June July			
But you know still more than that uh cough sorry			
there is an element of uh imitation or uh going after the uh foreign			
traditions in every country 			
Yes of course we can follow the language European			
languages I mean this English			
But the practice being 			
 But the practice if we follow their culture uh			
tradition 			
But you know see anyway English study is that has brought			
a number of good things to India and whatever it is			
Yes then			
I see what about the cultural no see the cultural uh 			
programmes and other items uh Mr Joy you said that uh the there's			
 a decline in your part			
Yeah sure			
And uh what is the reason behind it			
Actually there the thing is that you know for example			
Kathakali art I mean this uh uhm cultural items like Kathakali Turgal 			
it needs a life time I mean uh mean practice 			
For example six or seven years to master			
Ha true			
And you know nobody is nobody is 			
that patient enough to practice it 			
Even from our area know it's entirely different			
know that people they like they wanted to study all these uh old uh			
things older things you know			
Uh not only that uh usually these days the people have a			
tendency to look down upon such a traditional yeah yeah uh			
programme you know traditional uh cultural programmes of			
 Yeah yeah 			
I see			
That is the one of the main reason 			
Uh people always go after pop music uh dance cabarait			
dance uh and all those those things 			
Of course this is well and good but should we 			
yeah that's not uh our own 			
 Yeah 			
But in our area it is totally different			
I think uh now people have uh more liking or you can say 			
they love to learn uh Kathakali Bharatnatyam and uh see people do 			
Let me introduce myself Dr Joseph 			
 I'm G B Sajjan from the depot of Karnataka 			
How long have you been teaching ?			
No I am not a teacher I'm 			
I see 			
 I'm an officers steno working in a bank as a Junior			
Secretary 			
Uhm I'm myself a teacher 			
I have uh worked as a teacher for more than uh three			
decades I see at college level 			
Uh I retired in nineteen eighty-nine 			
Then took over as principal of a new one word college			
near Bijapur			
 I see 			
Oh 			
Well are you married ?			
Yes I am married 			
 Can I ask the question ?			
Sure sure 			
I am married I've got a child 			
She is seven years old studying			
Studying			
Studying in uh second standard			
Ah 			
And my wife is a teacher teaching in a high			
school in Kerala			
I see 			
She is also a school teacher			
Yeah 			
I have three children myself 			
The eldest is a daughter 			
She has completed her MBBS course and uh only recently			
she is uh appointed as a tutor in the college where she studied			
 That's fine 			
My son is doing his Diploma course he is in the second			
year 			
And the younger daughter uh completed her PUC only last March			
Well my elder daughter is not married yet 			
Ah you said your uh your child is a son or a daughter ?			
Daughter			
Daughter so in what standard is she studying ?			
Second standard 			
Second standard 			
Uh well tell something about uh your your field office			
 that's I mean your hobbies or something like that 			
Well my hobby is reading			
Reading 			
And nothing else nowadays 			
I have given up seeing even movies			
I don't see			
Uhm I sort of create have created my own world			
Yes			
And it is reading and writing writing and reading			
Yeah			
Of course most of it is uh writing letters or letter uh			
letter writing			
Uh ha 			
Uh I have published a book or two			
Is it ?			
Yeah I have written a book for uh B A English major			
students			
Ah ha that is something one word 			
It is entitled Literary Criticism An Introduction			
Ah ha 			
And another book is a collection of my radio talks 			
Oh you participated in radio talks also			
Yeah			
 That's good 			
I kept uh about twenty talks 			
Oh that is fine			
And some fourteen or fifteen them fifteen of			
them are collected uh brought together uh in a book			
form			
Oh 			
And the book is entitled A Board Block			
Ah ha 			
And that was published by an association called 			
Busset 			
 A few words 			
College English teacher uh Bijapur branch			
Bijapur 			
And uh it is uh constituted mostly by my own students			
For my retirement in nineteen eighty-nine they got together			
 uh a function to felicitate me			
Uh			
And as part of that uh felicitation function they brought			
out this collection of my radio talks 			
It is really great 			
One more that is uh of course I could have done some more			
work but being an administrator			
Uhm			
I have been an administrator for more than twenty years 			
For nearly twenty-five years I had been a principal of one college			
and another uh ha 			
I have headed three colleges 			
Uh in the thirty-seven years career as teacher and			
administrator both			
 Uh ha 			
Ah ha 			
But because of uh administrative work I have not been able			
to do much 			
Much of reading			
Uhm 			
And uh writing of course uh follows as a consequence			
 and uh 			
 But you didn't get enough time 			
Ah I much of my time is wasted in uh attending to the			
T V R I should say 			
 Accha 			
Though I though I have worked as both teacher and an			
administrator I had more satisfaction as a administrator than as a			
teacher because I did enjoy my teaching at the at the graduate			
level uh especially teaching made in English 			
Uh I taught one word for a number of years 			
And uh I was the only so to say specialised in that branch			
of uh English studies around there			
In your place			
Uh yeah 			
And uh my specialities one or two words again			
were middle English and uh literary teaching 			
So after teaching uh literary criticism for a year or two uh I			
thought my notes which I got up as a preparation for my class			
teaching could be published in book form			
Ah ha 			
So uh after resigning one word here and there			
I could uh bring them all in book form			
You are thinking of a second edition 			
No it has uh gone through a second edition also one			
or two words now it is due for uh reprint again 			
Of course this uh while it was printing the second time I			
made some addition uh I had a chapter on uh this practical			
criticism and I called it tentative notes for practical			
A new observation anyway one word 			
And one chapter I added on the new critics 			
At the insistance of a friend who is now head of the 			
English Department at Karnataka University			
Yeah she happens to be an old student of mine 			
And then again I had a post script to do one of the chapter 			
So this way it was uh the second edition of the book 			
So rather than reprinting as it is I use to add something more			
to the book			
Sure 			
Uh when it goes for third printing 			
And what about you ?			
Have you done anywhere since you are 			
you are experienced in printing and outsetting			
 Ha yeah 			
It reminds me one thing 			
Once only in my life as I am not a teacher I tried to publish			
a small book on grammar			
Grammar			
Actually that's functional grammar for uh in			
general for the students at the S S L C level and this for final level			
But it is one word because of so many problems			
That kind of progress uh has been in my mind too			
Oh yes I thought uh one or two word 			
 specially in our state it's in Kerala we brought uh 			
of course so many books borrowed from Andhra they one-word 			
like it			
 One-or-two-words 			
But uh we don't have a book which is really meant for 			
or useful to children one or two word 			
So I I uh like to publish a small book especially			
with regard to the uh examples 			
Examples one-word but then it didn't work			
Anyway I brought out a small one-word a book and 			
it's uh printing material and it's most uh efforts			
Yeah it's true			
Printing some thing and I once I thought of leaving			
everything uh but uh anyway I uh finished it but then it was not			
satisfactory			
Then my aim I mean it was my wish always uh I was uh I			
wanted to be a teacher			
Uh			
But uh that's the only thing I couldn't and when			
I did get the chance and uh if I got I missed it anyhow and			
now atleast			
Oh so you didn't get a chance			
Yeah a chance and			
 That's why you had to 			
Uh go for some other job and now I am working as an officer			
steno 			
And uh I am still rethinking of teaching uh uh I			
mean coming again to teaching 			
And I took my PG degree in three subjects in 			
English Malyalam and politics 			
 I see 			
 I see 			
Ahn			
And now I am doing my research in one of the topic in			
English 			
Good and very good			
 And 			
 I'm doing this course 			
 That's only for Inter 			
I have no other I mean prospectus nor tried for because it			
was late now I am age forty oh I have been late so I			
expect in that things 			
 Oh 			
 Now you want to change the line and go back to			
teaching after all			
Of course I tried in many ways uh after my			
S S C uhm which I was doing was trying many fields			
 Uh 			
 Uhm 			
Ahn			
I tried some banks and I knew Kuchipudi and 			
one-word Bharatnatyam oh and I studied for seven years			
 and I studied Carnatic music also 			
I studied uh some western music also and I can play very well			
 some southern musical instruments and I participated in 			
Dynamora one- word forum			
 Oh 			
Ah			
And uh I was the one-word the church choir being a			
christian 			
Well I tried many way but uh luck as if my			
star was not bright I think			
 Oh you did 			
I see yeah			
So I couldn't succeed			
Anyway I joined here as per my interest 			
Anyway I am hopeful I fought for the best to come 			
You seem to be versatile man with varied interests			
Thank you laughter 			
I couldn't have guessed as much from			
 I did try it 			
Tried it			
Tried it of course 			
You see uh cough man's abilities are not written			
on his face anyway 			
Oh yes yes			
But then uh			
It is uh call call it versatile			
because my experience is when ever we go deep investing we know how			
little we actually know 			
Accepted I can feel that that from from 			
 my own experience after simply taking a degree I mean BA that			
was in economics 			
I simply uh showed courage to take the programme of teach			
for a wrestler without any reference or preparation I mean			
Ahn 			
But uh after taking my MA I will now try without			
preparation because that's 			
No doubt			
Means that uh when we go deep into a thing then only we			
know how less we do 			
Then we have to prepare uh well			
One has to recollect one stops on uh that's uh			
how we teach literature 			
Before one uh has to do any talking on that is			
literature 			
No doubt for uh on every reading once possibly see the			
new meaning in it one see something new			
 Sure sure 			
Oh			
 It's always better to read the poem or			
prose piece once again carefully before we give a talk on it			
 Yes 			
Sure 			
You know I used to have uh some other interest too			
I used to be a sportsman at school 			
And then college of course I my interests uh were			
 tape recorded ultimately it's only books uh that			
have remained my first and last interest			
Uh			
You may even call it my first and last love I'm 			
the complete bookworm so to say			
Yeah 			
But then to deserve that affiliation that name			
either kam dand one word 			
Uhm uhm			
Which I've not 			
Then one's administration cuts into one's 			
 time which I would like to devote to books			
Well your major parts of your life was connected with a			
lot of administration and all			
Yeah that has to be yeah uh into most of my			
time 			
Moreover even uh managing the household			
 Yeah 			
Yes yes that familiar thing			
 Yeah that takes a lot out of us 			
 Yes 			
Yes			
Uh my Mrs is not a highly educated			
Oh 			
And uh so I have to take on most uh most of the burden			
of the uh seeing to the childrens education sure their			
requirements			
 Sure 			
Universal			
Their upbringing			
Yeah 			
You know one-or-two-words 			
 One-or-two-words 			
My Mrs can't be of much help to me in my profession 			
rather I have to be of some help to her			
Oh			
In fact in the household work			
Yes 			
So it's like that			
So even that have claims over my time			
Oh 			
Which I wish could have been spent to my which I			
might have devoted to reading and writing			
Reading and writing			
Yes 			
 It's always the problem with we people 			
 I've admired and been suffered with uh mine has been			
a chequered career uhm I for studied in three			
colleges I have taught in four colleges			
 Uhm 			
Uhm that's something great you have the			
experience of teaching in different colleges			
 And uh 			
Again one or two words I had to to be without			
any employment for six months uh I suffered uh break of service			
And that told upon my one-word also 			
I suffered a great loss in terms of one- word 			
But uh none of that has been able to uh darken the			
horizon of my mind 			
You really you have the presence of mind to fetch the			
boundary 			
Yeah			
Yeah that's uh one uh has to do 			
Say then I just only remember for telling these night and			
day dispute but never be defeated that these are the credit to our			
 one-word 			
One of these setbacks			
Ah sure			
Uh I have been able to tell upon my one-word 			
tell upon my outlook on life 			
I have always sought healthy thoughts 			
And uh never looked back

Especially in anger 			
Never Look Back in Anger

But here we have			
 Ah 			
Yes yes of course 			
We have here lot of breeze you know			
Ah			
Here we've lot of breeze and uh actually			
May be due to uh this this place around uh Mysore			
is full of forests			
Forest dense forest			
Not only that it is at high altitude from the sea			
Yes			
So it is uh very cool			
Yes people also call it as city of garden 			
 Such a climate city of garden 			
Such a climate we can not uh enjoy in our place 			
By the by you went on your trip			
Yes yesterday we had been to uh Srirangapatnam and			
then uh			
Somnathpuram temple			
Yes Somnathapuram also we went we just wanted to visit all			
the places in and around uh Mysore 			
And because we are not familiar here you know we just went to			
the Karnataka Tourism and Development Corporation and we booked uh 			
for the bus and it was a very pleasant journey indeed 			
Have you accustomed with the Mysore weather ?			
No half way because we are not we we came here			
 off handed off handed in the sense uh we didn't forsee this climate 			
We didn't bring any warm clothes with us 			
These are the clothes we have to manage 			
So especially during night time we feel so chill			
Oh 			
After spending some two weeks uh alright we are 			
Okay			
Okay 			
And uh Mr Ramchandran uh I came to know that you 			
was were the principal of uh Vaishva College in Selam			
Yes sir			
And uh when you uh wh wh when you when			
you were promoted to that 			
Uh last year sir			
Last year

Is it a co-education ?			
Yes sir co-education institution sir ahn 			
strength of around seven hundred students			
 Ahn 			
Seven hundred students			
And out of two hundred are girls			
Ah girls uh 			
What are the subjects that you are having there in			
BSc computer science BCom B B M B B A B S one word			
 science			
I see			
It belongs to Arya Vaishya Community 			
Oh very well			
So it uh it is a self financed unaided college			
 Institution 			
Institution but affiliated to university of Madras 			
And how about the trend of the students 			
The trend of the students is mixed sir 			
 Of the 			
Ha I see ha ha			
We can't say we can't justify ourselves that there are of			
 high class or of low class			
 Higher 			
The situation in all the colleges uh do you face this uh			
have strike of students no sir in your institution ?			
 No sir 			
No it is highly impossible			
We can't do it because we are not allowing them to form			
 form an association			
Uh but 			
 They can represent 			
Each and every individual has got right to represent			
Oh I see			
But you you don't allow this union chairman no 			
secretary			
 No 			
No sir			
But uh in government colleges uh they have their own			
freedom to be			
Even in uh our			
Have you seen sir many students you know dancing sometimes 			
at the time of elections			
Yeah			
And uh almost I think uh political influence is there			
Yes			
Uh politicians are uh encouraging their students to			
get their leaders elected 			
 What's going on 			
 Students are the instruments for the po 			
politicians			
Ha yes politicians 			
Uh this is a great problem nowadays in the colleges that is			
 every year when the new boy student comes to the college			
Uhm			
They uh			
Old students they were are ragging			
Ragging and the uh uh with the help of welcoming them			
Ha			
They involve in ragging			
Uhm 			
And they are about to tease			
Uhm 			
In such a case women students are more affected			
More affected by this			
Especially in the professional colleges			
You mean eve teasing			
Yes eve teasing no especially in the			
professional colleges 			
Even sometimes they committing commit 			
 suicide			
 No 			
Oh			
Yes yes I came across one such case 			
Oh 			
It happened uh in my place 			
And another case is uh he mentally he became imbalanced			
 and he was affected 			
He discontinued the course and came			
I see 			
But he was a meritorius student 			
Student 			
Got a thousand one word 			
Uh thousand out of			
Out of two one thousand two hundred			
Got two hundred 			
Such a good boy			
He was fine within say four months			
Usually these things will take place only in the			
professional colleges 			
Question arises			
But it has been			
But 			
Now it is followed by Arts and Science colleges			
Even in Arts colleges			
Even Arts and Science colleges			
All in Arts place			
It is going on 			
Because uh those who are born rich uhm they			
are coming to chit-chat			
 Uhm 			
Yes			
Yes 			
They are enjoying by the uhm they are			
enjoying this uh statistic pressure			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
They come to college to only just to spend their time			
Yeah to spend their time 			
Uh they study is not their primary motive			
No 			
But when they when they study in schools you know they			
are alright 			
They are obedient			
No even in higher secondary that uh junior college			
Ha			
They are supposed to be like that 			
But uh we do not uh come across such uh problems			
Oh you are uh working in the girls school			
Yes we because I am working in the girls school I do			
not have any such problems over there			
In co-education we find problems			
My myself too because I am working in an aided uh			
higher secondary school			
Oh			
Uh my management is uh someone who cares more			
discipline and law 			
For him the result is secondary one discipline is foremost			
thing 			
We don't have strike and uh these and that 			
But even then boys attitude is some changing 			
They are able to sense it			
Uhm 			
And what is your vocational group sir there in your 			
addition group 			
 We have three vocational groups sir one is			
uh a general mel mel malaciest 			
 Malaciest 			
And the other one is uh radio TV mechanism			
 That's a very good course 			
Uh a very good course sir uh bright future is also			
And that is also useful to them in future			
In future 			
And the third one is office secretaryship			
I see oh 			
That course			
There they will be having typewriting and uh shorthand ha			
Uh type writing uh accountancy commerce and office			
management 			
Uh yes yes			
We here sir in our school we have uh dress designing 			
Oh			
And making 			
Oh yes since it's a girls high school			
Oh yes yes and this year we have planned to introduce 			
nursing also			
Nursing 			
Nursing also sir and we are having uh building			
maintenance also			
Also 			
They can join polytechnic			
Ahn okay			
For practical and other things of course we do not have uh			
 all the facilities that are expected 			
But still we send our girls to the nearby polytechnic			
Polytechnic			
To undergo the practical work 			
Are you looking after any business other than profession sir ?			
No sir no business			
No no business			
My sole profession is teaching 			
 Teaching 			
 No nothing sir 			
 Yourself sir ?			
I do not have any business now sir 			
Once I had but after becoming a teacher you know I wanted			
to dedicate my life			
Ah yes yes			
To the teaching profession			
I see 			
Formally I was a businessman 			
Uh then I didn't have peace of mind 			
Of course I could earn a lot			
Lot			
But after becoming a teacher you know I have the 			
happiness rather I have the pleasure 			
 You have moreover 			
If we have some other business means we cannot do			
 full justice to this profession 			
 To profession yes certainly 			
The every teacher should be like that			
Uh but uh most probably nowadays all the teachers I can			
say sir are engaged in some or the other in any business			
Even college uh professors you know			
College professors most of the college professors			
 are engaged in business and uh especially in government			
colleges			
 Yeah yeah one or two words 			
Yes in government colleges			
Earn a lot			
Uhm			
And I know one professor uh in Selam who was our			
professor also 			
He is the owner of a mosaic factory			
Oh			
Mosaic factory and he is uh earning a lot 			
 One or two words 			
Yes certainly and uh frequently he goes to Rajasthan 			
to buy the marbles			
Ahn 			
And then he comes back to Selam			
Ahn			
But actually I doubt uh whether he will be rather 			
concentrating on his profession			
Profession true certainly he can't 			
laughter 			
 True 			
Because 			
As a businessman			
Ten days or fifteen days he takes to go and come back 			
And uh where will be the time for him to prepare for the			
students students very difficult 			
 Students 			
And uh do you have any of your staff like that sir ?			
Yes sir in your college			
Yes			
Uh			
They are uh looking after that business			
Uhn			
But uh in our college they can't uh have their			
involvement in business only			
Business uh			
We are having a strict vigilance oh whether			
they are uh teaching properly oh 			
When they are completing the syllabus ah 			
Are they going according to the syllabus uhn 			
And uh really the we are testing the feedback of the students			
 Oh 			
 Oh 			
 Ah 			
 Uhn 			
Oh 			
If the students give uh gives any complaint 			
 uhm or if they place a letter in the suggestion box about the			
 performance of the professors in the one or two words 			
 Uhn 			
 Oh you are having a separate suggestion box 			
We are taking severe action 			
 Action against the			
We are having separate suggestion box which is operated			
by the correspondent of our college			
Ah ha 			
Not even principal			
Ha 			
And he will take action on this letters 			
 That means all these letters uh dropped in the			
box goes to the corresponding			
Yes correspondence secretary			
Ha ha she will look into the matter 			
He 			
Ah he			
Uhm he will be looking into the matter			
I see 			
And uh he will take uh stern and uh sturdious action 			
 action uh for the			
 Action 			
So job security may not be expected there			
No uh no it's not like that			
They were they will be having proper enquiry 			
Enquiry ha			
Both the side 			
I see ha ha 			
Initially they will give warning uhm such			
and such comments are coming uhm you have to be careful			
 right 			
Warning is there			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Right 			
There 			
Thank God for us uh I think sir laughter in uh 			
higher secondary school we do not have such uh such a			
problem			
 Such uh 			
Problem 			
Because it's a private college 			
And it's a developing institution they want to earn			
a status in that district 			
So they are trying for that 			
And in Tamil Nadu sir why should not we introduce uh			
junior college system sir 			
 What's your opinion about that ?			
Yes well but uh what higher secondary it means it			
itself means junior college			
Yes of course but uh our uh education minister is not			
for that it seems			
Uh not means that			
He wants to call PG teachers as PG teachers only			
teachers only uhm uh he doesn't like to give the			
designation designation atleast lecturer			
 Uhm 			
 Designation 			
Lecturer or uh like that laughter 			
Do you find any difference between PG one word and			
lecturer ?			
No no we don't find them uh 			
Supposing if it is a junior college you know uh we can have			
that designation 			
But uh 			
Working in 			
If it is a school 			
Working in a school we can't get that uh 			
 A few words 			
We can't get that uh			
Yeah attractive you mean			
Status 			
Abstract designation			
 That's all what can we say but our work is the			
same			
Yea 			
Anything which is spoken in India will be Indian English or			
 a particular type of English will be called Indian English 			
No I think English spoken here in the Indian context 			
 in on the Indian soil that's what we 			
 saying say India English 			
And there will be different types of Indian English 			
Indian English one two three and so on			
There must be different types of Indian Englishes because we			
have different varieties of languages spoken here in India varieties			
means different families of languages spoken here in India			
Or how many of this is the most Indian of all these Indian			
Englishes again becomes a question 			
Yeah that's true 			
I think that is one of his task to find out 			
 We can ask him also			
 So when was 			
When was this when was this started this subject of			
Indian English 			
I think it started around sixtees so I feel			
I remember in the college uh Mr uh I forgot			
the name of this English teacher but it is on my tongue			
Yes 			
He brought the book uh Common Errors in in			
Indian Literature he mentioned certain things like			
 a big size a big big size 			
What is that that's like			
 Nahi big size 			
 Achha what's that one			
An Arab stays in the big size what you say			
I see 			
But he said it's a wrong English 			
it's a wrong English and it should be like he he			
 he recommended some other books for the use			
So what are what is the what books did you have			
I forgot I was giving an example			
Okay 			
So that kind of thing with Indian English or what is			
Indian English that wrong wrong one so called wrong one in			
Indian English or right one in Indian English 			
No no you cannot say wrong one or right one not I think			
there are some influences and interferences from the mother tongues 			
Oh			
The newspeak English it's a 			
one word 			
 So the concept is changing those days 			
certain things spoken in Indian English were considered wrong			
Wrong that's it			
And now even a wrong ones are Indian English I think			
So whatever English which is spoken here in India I think			
these are all rule governed because there is no language which is not			
rule governed 			
So in that way you cannot say that Indian English is spoken here in			
India is wrong			
But uh many people in India speak English with			
the 			
Yeah even we will make one of			
No no I what I mean to say is uh many people in India			
speak English in the wrong tense uh wrong wrong construction 			
 yeah that kind of thing			
 Yeah 			
So how do you 			
And the one word is where past participle to be			
used yeah present is used that kind of a yeah			
 that kind of thing			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
That kind of thing 			
So how many speak English 			
So that is that is			
Is it is it to be categorised as wrong English or Indian			
English 			
It can't be categorised as wrong English it is to be			
categorised as Indian English			
But you must remember is 			
Yes 			
You remember your collegues 			
Yes 			
And uh his English laughter 			
So uh I want to say I want to tell something I			
want to say something or the other to you means			
No I can teach English uh I don't know what kind of			
English is this but that's sometimes there are			
Englishes which are spoken by local people which are quite intolerable like			
 That means 			
 Haan if you can consider it as a very very			
extreme form of Indian English or 			
I think			
No you have to you will define a range			
Yeah that's yes that's what			
 You've to define your range or to which you can			
consider something as Indian English yes so I think that			
 Yes 			
So even even Indian English no there must be			
established Indian English I think that uh should be			
brought out			
 No 			
 Uh 			
Something as Indian English			
So that will be taken as a variety of Indian English 			
So you say like an example I remember uh a song			
 which was uh uh written in Kannada when I was in Bangalore 			
several years back this song was very popular uh this this 			
English song uh this song is sung by a gardener or a helper 			
to a rich maiden uh rich lady 			
So the song goes in Kannada mixed with English 			
Kannada Kannada interspersed with English English uh English			
words broken English words so the language goes madam giving giving			
money			
Without any word without any one word 			
 Haan madam madam give me money I bring in			
clouds 			
So suppose and this is not a concocted example 			
many people 			
Yeah			
Specially helpers who know something this is they			
are going to speak			
Yes			
So this is cooked up in your mind some certains			
 certain words it is simple			
I think that that why			
So we we consider Indian			
Kannada English or will we consider is something which can be			
considered English 			
So that we have to decide up upto what level you			
can considered it an English proper I mean uh proper English or even			
proper language 			
Yes 			
Because unless you define a range anything which is			
cooked up even a a monkey or a even a computer which stores			
certain things jumbled up			
Yeah 			
You mix words jumble it up and what whatever comes			
out you'll say is Indian English or African English 			
depending on where it is spoken 			
Yeah the interference is from mother tongue that they			
have all this interference is like people used to consider is uh as			
a mistake but those mistakes uh they they used to sort of reject the			
mistakes 			
Now these mistakes are normal considered as unwanted element 			
they in fact on the basis of error which are made by the speakers 			
of different communities are tak taken as a strategy 			
So that uh after chronicling this strategy they can			
 uh what to say they can make uh plan			
Yeah I remember uh another form of very interesting Indian			
English which was spoken in J N U where I studied 			
Uh J N U in the evening uh you have to see the J N U uh			
you can visit until seven people thronging the bus and they talk			
Marxism art cultural dance debating so all those uh smart			
 girls and boys in J N U used to sit together and they used to talk			
as not all not all of them 			
But certain classes among them			
Yeah 			
Who had rich fathers or you know with uh uhn higher			
incomes or you know where a certain kind of life style 			
Yes yeah 			
Yes this this one includes there 			
 Yeah this one like 			
Pardon uh 			
You cannot have to bring the tea here no 			
Yes 			
No you tell him to bring it you bring it here			
Ah here here one ah here it is there			
What form of two words 			
Oh sorry			
 That's too much one word know you should			
 one or two words 			
When I think of two this thank you haan			
 			
So I think it's already two min 			
it's already ten minutes more than ten minutes no			
 Let's hope another another few lines and this			
Okay			
It will be over so I remember 			
Uh			
I was just pacing out wherin			
Yeah 			
So there names speak some changes like uh you know 			
uh uh one word yesterday you know uh in Hindi 			
You know he's wear the jean he brought was impressing you			
know			
 That's I think that's uh			
That kind of thing you see 			
Then uh I saw with my friend uh you know what what Michael			
says in Hindi but but you know I can write it one word that			
kind of so mixed English			
Yeah got one			
You know we you know what happened when you say something 			
 uhn in Hindi then you continue with English			
 Uhn 			
 That's what you call code mixing 			
So what is it is it Indian Hindi English or Indian Hindi			
English ?			
So that's what makes a construction			
And there is something called			
 One or two words 			
I wanted to ask professor Shastri here something is called			
Hinglish 			
Hinglish			
Uhn			
I know Hinjali 			
Not Hinjali Hinglish Hinglish			
Hinglish means 			
H I N			
Yeah I know Hinglish 			
Yeah			
Hindi English			
Yeah 			
Combined 			
English spoken by you know 			
Hindi speakers 			
Hindi speaking but of course they won't be speaking these			
people 			
 Accha 			
Where you know Hinglish is modified according to their			
convenience 			
 Haan uh so where did you come across			
this English 			
This comes in newspapers in printed news 			
Hinglish once I came across like Hinjali 			
isn't it			
 Hinjali I don't know 			
Hindi you remember I think uh 			
So in English I have come across but Hinjali I don't			
know			
 Hinjali it's uh I think their argument			
influences in Punjabi from I think nil the other way round there are			
some influences of Punjabi songs in Hindi 			
Uhm that way it could be 			
But it's 			
That 			
But there is something different na 			
Yeah that is also something different 			
 That 			
Their way			
I just remember that uh that one			
And we			
I remember the words 			
Yeah another form of variants of English			
Yeah but what is it 			
 Indian English will be considered as a			
variant of English or variety of English 			
It is a variety spoken here in India			
And variant and va variety say I think they are			
 quite different			
Yeah they are just			
 Variant 			
Variant			
Uh so that it's uh 			
Variant variant is uh			
Variant is 			
Is a little different from I think variant 			
Uhn 			
Varieties of these very necessarily main influences 			
I think it differs on which perspective you are trying to say			
that no 			
No that 			
Variant means uh Hinglish 			
No I variant in fact it contains			
I can yes some sudden			
It can			
Uhn			
It can have some substance of you know that makes			
Yeah yeah that's true			
 Substance or you know away from the north			
 Haan yeah that's one 			
But I think it is a very vast topic so unless you define			
some range 			
Yeah 			
Unless you bring certain 			
But you			
Uh certain certain acceptable you know criteria			
A rough 			
Uh this Indian English will be too hard and uh you note a			
 useless for an Indian English			
I think regarding this we have to take other exam with			
faculty no you know Sushil Kumar one word will it go			
straight uh			
 No 			
So we pick up a case Indian English in Manipur or			
what is called Indian English in Manipur or Manipuri Indian English 			
You take up that case 			
Even though Manipur is a small state uh most Indians don't			
know about Manipur very less it speaks more 			
But even though it is a small state tiny state so called tiny			
state you have to take up a project like Indian English spoken in			
Manipur you will see how many varieties how many different forms 			
I do remember Hindi spoken by these people like Kukis once 			
already there are friends and colleagues and the Primoga 			
even that those two Americans 			
I know as far as that two words			
 error is displayed			
 That then uh 			
 Then uh 			
See in the in the case of uh Doctor uh you know that			
uh or Economics professor Muslim professor they will speak in a			
different there use and way you know it's been the way they			
speak English is different 			
So it's a English academy which is			
No the way they speak is Manipur is a in Uttar			
Pradesh they speak Manipur uh English is not so different as no			
 this			
 There is a 			
 No 			
I think I think there is some differnce 			
Then uh			
I don't see there is much 			
Dr N Loken the elder brother of Dr. Loken 			
uh he'll speak in a typical so called intellectual student like			
intellectual way 			
All this is higher 			
What is it?			
What is your opinion			
Ah they are smaller in one na it will uh 			
They are tribals for example uh uh			
Yeah that's true			
Or professor			
Ha literateurs are there 			
Henry			
Ah 			
They speak in English in a different way and again 			
even now this Kukis speak English in a different way from Tamkuls or			
other Nagas 			
I think yeah you may think that I am a Kuki upper			
 Yeah 			
Ahn			
I was just I was just			
 That's not a one word difference are 			
 so bound to come 			
 So 			
Then 			
 That's what there is the the debate of Indian			
English 			
Uh you take up even in a tiny state there are so many			
varieties			
Yeah 			
So how many we work at it 			
You have to you have to define a range 			
Yeah here 			
Upto which you can consider certain things 			
There is English for part of what I can which is considered as			
certain range 			
Upto which you can consider certain things			
I mean it's sort of fresh or 			
 Something a language something a language			
 for a suitable language 			
Then after area you have to decide define certain things 			
acceptable English see			
Acceptable norms 			
Ahn whether it is Indian English call English Hindi 			
just forget that but what you have to define			
Uhn 			
Then only you can take up			
As as you have American started earlier English na			
 I think we should although we I think we already have a 			
Indian style we have it you know 			
We have to have considered a limit na extreme limit			
 Yeah 			
Yes 			
And then whatever falls			
Arrange 			
Whatever falls 			
Within that range			
Within within range in that range then on then only			
you speak up in Indian English 			
Otherwise you continue with that English			
I think if we get an influence 			
 Haan 			
Rush 			
With English spoken like			
 one word 			
Manipuri special dialect all that you have to include			
Yeah 			
If you want to represent a model of India			
Ah that's 			
 That's true 			
It will become an impossible to yeah do that kind			
of			
 Yeah 			
English that that's spoken here in Indian no 			
So it is a it is a vast topic 			
I think we can somehow please stop here

One of the building they look quite old yeah 			
and it looked like a			
 Yeah

It is not a palace and even may be it was built during			
the time of British British may be because these pillars and

The sprawling grounds are lovely 			
Yes 			
Yeah there is lot of Mysore is a lo beautiful place

Very pleasant			
Very pleasant climate 			
Especially to those who have been in Madras 			
Uhm yes that is it			
You have a dry weather in Madras 			
Yes very dry and			
 It's very warm now 			
And we don't get so much rain you know as you get here in Mysore			
or in Kerala like that we know see it's very 			
that's why this scarcity of water is a problem no			
 We know 			
You sweat a lot and that is one word 			
Do you have wa wa water scarcity problem also			
Yes during summer the water scarcity			
Yeah then it becomes very one word 			
 Very acute 			
I have heard that the water comes in truckloads			
Yes 			
Yes 			
Yes even now they are doing like that one			
word and you have to buy water 			
 One word 			
Oh you have to pay 			
 You have to buy yeah two hundred rupees			
 and all one tanker you get 			
And you have to fill it you fill your tank and			
you can use it for atleast atleast one week no			
 In your tank 			
How do you like the place Prabha 			
I like it fine the only thing it doesn't agree with my			
constitution with weather 			
Yes I too find it uh little bit chill 			
What about you Uma 			
No I think when I came here initially I wasn't well 			
Now I think I got accustomed to this climate and other thing 			
How about you 			
No initially it didn't affect me but I think uh now my			
resistance is much less uhm and I have got sore			
throat cold			
 Uhm 			
Uhm I think it must be also because that you are away from			
your son			
Yeah ah 			
By the way how old is your son 			
He is twelve and he is in ninth standard 			
Twelve and in ninth standard			
Yes			
But it is very early I think in school			
I I too think so 			
He is very young for the class 			
How many kids do you have 			
I have uh just one 			
What about you Uma			
I have got two 			
Got a son in fifth standard ah and a daughter 			
she is admitted in KG in one word 			
 Ah 			
Won't they miss you			
Definitely 			
I have written to my son			
And my husband also has written to me saying that he miss me a lot			
What about you Prabha			
Haven't you received any letter from home			
I have written to them			
 I'm expecting a reply from			
How many kids you have			
Two kids			
Both girls I have never left them alone till now			
Which class are they			
Fifth and Sixth			
Girls in yes the problem of platting the hair			
washing the hair			
I don't know what they are doing at home			
 Yes 			
My husband must be just keeping the cooker and they must be			
eating just daal and rice			
When you go			
Your husband is a good cook I think			
No he not I don't say he is a good cook but he will manage			
somehow I think			
Yeah yeah			
Know when we go back no I think we'll get a rosy			
welcome home welcome there 			
 Yes laughter 			
Everybody would have missed us a lot no 			
Perhaps they will understand our value better then 			
All the work which we did then			
Yeah 			
Sometime this parting is necessary no yeah 			
temporary parting 			
Especially one or two words 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah we'll also realise their importance and 			
they'll also one word 			
Ah yes			
Especially my son's case no he is very much			
attached 			
I feel uh that this separation will help him to uh get			
 uh become a little bit independent 			
But the only thing I'm bothered is regarding his studies			
no 			
Because I help him a lot with his studies 			
Now of course he's got to get the help of his			
father or grand parents or someone else 			
 Uhm 			
 Ayyo my daughters were saying you know 			
 yeah before I left they were saying how will we study			
 Yeah 			
Because I'm the one who coaches them 			
My husband comes at very late from work 			
And he doesn't have much time to attain to their studies 			
So all their studying the home work part and all that they feel as			
if no like it's like even though I would they would have			
felt uh mummy is not letting us play and all so long 			
Now that uh strictness is removed from them they I think 			
they'll feel a bit insecure 			
So they were asking me			
My son too needs me 			
Otherwise he won't touch the book 			
I don't know what he he is doing in my absence 			
May be he's cutting his tution classes and uh			
just whiling away the time 			
But he is with your parents no			
Yes a few words pamper pamper him a lot 			
 It's okay just for a month 			
For a change let him get pampered then he will change back to his			
normal routine 			
How about your hobbies and all 			
What do you do during your			
I I I play with my son yeah 			
He doesn't like chess because he has to use his brain			
 Yeah 			
 Brain well			
He like shuttle cock better than that 			
 So I play 			
 No even for shuttle cock you have to use your			
brain			
You have to one or two words 			
 No one or two words maybe that 			
kind of 			
 Kind of but it would be better than an indoor			
game no 			
No it's an indoor game only 			
Uhm			
Oh shuttle cock 			
But I play it as an outdoor game 			
Of course when it's very windy we can't do that 			
And he expects me to run about just like uh 			
uhm young girl uhm which I'm not able to do			
So very often he wins and I lose 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Only you lost to your little son 			
What about you 			
What do you do during your spare time			
 My hobby is tailoring and uh some			
painting 			
 A few words 			
 Do you sing 			
Do you sing 			
Sing I like to sing but where is the time except in the			
bathroom or in the kitchen laughter 			
But you learn music 			
Uh I learnt when I was young I learn			
Ah 			
I love singing in fact I want to learn along with my			
daughters			
I want to uh join them in a music class and I also want to			
learn 			
But at present there is no time and no energy also 			
What about you 			
I spent my time reading a lot of fiction one or two			
words 			
There is time for all that one or two words 			
 A few words no somehow I do it I read			
 half an hour a day			
 It's a wonder 			
I get books from the library no 			
So naturally I'm forced to return it within a week 			
Somehow uhm I get the time somehow and read it			
 Uhm 			
My I never manage to read a story book during my school days			
you know			
Ah			
I have joined a lending library but I enjoy 			
and take a book only in the month of May			
 One or two words 			
Uh 			
Only in the month of May I'll take 			
About ten to twenty books I'll read that's 			
all			
I never I can never resist a book somehow 			
 But I 			
 Here also go to library 			
 As far as I can never resist a book 			
 Yeah it's nice to have that habit 			
But somewhere at the dining table uhm 			
somewhere when everybody is watching TV uhm I will go and			
sit and read			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
No I have a very bad habit			
If there is a story book I won't do anything else till I 			
 yeah finish the story book once I started			
 Yeah 			
I know that that's not possible 			
So while while the milk is boiling I just stand there with			
the book in my hand and one or to words and I read the book 			
See somehow I manage to finish the book 			
Very difficult once the school starts na			
 uhm very difficult 			
 Uhm 			
I don't know how I'm going to get back into that			
routine you know now			
Uhm 			
Quite relaxed I'm now then I'll have to			
go and whatever I do now whatever time I take just to get ready

 The teachers are very well paid 			
I don't like to leave India			
Nearly fifteen thousand rupees per month you			
know that 			
Whatever it is I'm not very much attracted by those			
jobs			
Uhm

stable in India

atleast one or two words with the neighbours 			
I don't know what they must be thinking of me but of course I			
Even I I live in a flat

She was there for one and a half year 			
Stayed there for some month 			
And you said you were you were in Bombay no ?			
How was Bombay ?			
I did my schooling in Bombay 			
You like Bombay or Manglore ?			
 One or two words my college one or two			
words in Bombay 			
Now I have got used to this life 			
This slow life 			
Uhn that way I think many place is better than Bombay			
And I did my college here 			
And my post graduation here 			
And now I'm working in one word 			
Know I keep going to Bombay every now and then			
Uhn ah			
You have friends there ?

How uninteresting ?			
What is uninteresting in that 			
Then what ?			
A young girl like your age having only girlfriend I just			
 can't imagine			
 May be may be 			
May be I should have been your daughter 			
My parents won't accept that

A girl like you with uh 			
Without boyfriend

Contrast 			
Why anyway I told you you can be my daughter-in-law no 			
I refuse that offer laughter this is the second			
time you have offered 			
 You don't you don't know what you are missing			
And this is the second time I have refused 			
Declined the offer 			
You don't know what you are missing			
Tell me did you go anywhere in this summer ?			
How did you spent your summer time ?			
Summer I don't know how it passed 			
I just went to Madras for a short visit 			
I told you know we had our Lion's Conference 			
What for ?			
And by well where is the time			
As soon as the exams were over evaluation and then uh			
I just finished evaluation and came here 			
I didn't go anywhere no 			
Just I kill the time in summer reading doing nothing			
Evaluation you have done ?			
Usually you got			
I went for vacation and I stayed in Banglore for sixteen			
days and I came back home 			
Well Dr Nihalani we got a number of uh articles uh			
 made of wood just half an hour back what do you think about these			
 ?			
 Ashok is it ?			
I think they are quite good 			
Good and cheap 			
Uh I think one of the reasons why we liked them was			
that uh they were brought to one word and the other thing			
was that they were very nice and uh we could use them as a			
presents to our relatives and friends 			
Don't you think so ?			
Yes a very reasonably priced 			
And uh items were all very compact 			
Oh yes 			
 That's what uh I I like them			
immensely 			
 Uh 			
What do you think about our visit to Dhanyalok the other			
day that is last Sunday ?			
It was quite uplifting I should say uh to be there			
 uh it was a lovely evening we spent with Dr C D N 			
yes 			
Uh the warm hospitality yeah 			
And uh that pleasant environment yeah uh 			
was real good that I should say 			
 Yes 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Wasn't it a very memorable and treasurable experience ?			
Yes of course			
Yes 			
Uh especially when you are from we were made to sit uh			
 in the in vichar yeah in the in the			
 Sanjay Vichara Mantapum when then we had 			
tea in the garden and then Dr C D N uh talked to us about			
several things yeah including poetry thesis poetry 			
 yeah 			
And uh well his first encounter with T S Eliot 			
 yeah 			
Now well this was really absorbing very interesting			
 uhm			
 In vichar 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Well everytime we even see C D N everytime we talk to him			
 yeah we find that well we are energised and we feel			
inspired and at same time we feel that we have to do quite a lot 			
 Yeah 			
As compared to what he does 			
Then he also uhm you know gave us a copy of Brindavanam 			
 yeah the new periodical started and then the recent issue of			
 Literary Criterion 			
Uh number one is tour of nineteen ninety-three 			
 uhm which uh has a I mean which has special number on			
 the drama in post graduate they conducted uh sometime back 			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
And he was quite encouraging you know to one word 			
uh and at work yes uh Dhanyalok to be just one man			
show 			
 Yes 			
Yes			
He said he's seventy-three now			
Oh yes			
Doing an extremely useful work 			
Certainly he			
In the field of English studies and indigenous arts			
Yes 			
And I felt terribly inspired yes and uh 			
that even at that age after retirement yes one can do lots			
of good things			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
Yes 			
So to me it was extremely uplifting and educative 			
yes I must say 			
 Yes 			
Uh another thing			
Yeah, so please continue 			
 A another thing is that he uh he enc 			
 uh encourages the scholars to come out there and uh read uh on			
their own 			
Maybe uh concerning with their research topics or			
 maybe the literature of their interest yeah because			
he has a number of books on Commonwealth Literature 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Certainly he has a 			
 And a 			
He has a very good library in fact			
And at the same time I suppose uh there is a good place to			
sit also			
Yes			
Especially in the library hall			
Library hall the sitting arrangement			
The round table			
The sitting arrangement is quite good 			
 Quite good 			
And then there are number of photographs also you must have			
seen 			
And he has the photograph of his teacher uh Dr F R Levis			
Yes yes 			
Hey you know these scholars are very well looked after			
Yes			
Uhm as members of uh his family			
Yes			
I have uh an occasion Dr Inamdar's in Aurangabad			
 oh yes his wife 			
He was uh there for about a week			
Uh wanted to consult books on Commonwealth Literature			
 Oh yes 			
Right yes			
Uh they were all admiration for the man and for his			
family			
Certainly yes			
You see and besides uh the the guidence that he got 			
here in the subject			
Uhm I very much remember you know the warm hospitality and			
affection that they			
Oh yes oh yes we remember uhm yeah			
 one or two words 			
Everyone who stays with them has very fond memories of their			
stay and uh there you know happy moments of talk and discussions			
 That's true 			
I think there is also his assistant by his uh son and his			
sister-in-law			
Yeah one of his			
And few others			
Daughters-in-law			
Yeah daughter-in-law sorry			
And uh some of his uh grand children			
Yeah some of the grand children also yes			
So uhm			
Yes it it was memorable uhn experience through			
Uh so one really feels like visiting Mysore 			
uhm especially for this purpose of uh visiting Brindavan and uh 			
 Uhm 			
Another advantage is it's quite close to Manas			
Gangotri one word 			
Uhm the university campus			
University campus of Mysore 			
So it's really situated at an ideal place			
So that was one of my			
It is uh far away from the noise and bustle and one word			
 tumble of the town 			
And uh			
Well it's an ideal place for meditation and study			
room			
I very much wanted to visit the place			
And I'm glad I've been able to			
Yeah 			
Uhm also that one word Central Institute Of			
Indian Languages 			
Yes			
Uhm I enjoyed my visit to that place too			
Yes			
Ah that way yeah some usual work			
 Yeah 			
Certainly 			
Another thing is that we were very fortunate in having uh two			
visits to Brindavan			
Yeah especially when I uh well I had stayed over here for			
a month			
Yeah and uh I think we could consider ourselves fortunate in			
having these two visits			
So that we have uh have very close that a few words			
 and especially he gave us lot of information about that			
Yeah			
Uhm he gave us that one word also yeah			
 two words and he mentioned uh I think you saw him 			
didn't you ?			
 Yeah 			
Well yes I was chanced to walk there P G teacher on			
the evening alone 			
That was quite sometime ago			
Yeah a couple of years ago I suppose 			
Yeah so quite well done that was also 			
collected			
Yeah			
We mentioned of that and uh 			
Yeah 			
When you mentioned it to Dr Cyrian he was also there I think			
Yeah 			
And uh yeah this is one of the institute in India uh run			
by one person yes and not an official institute			
 Yes 			
No but uh really a an ideal istitute which caters to			
needs of very serene uh devoted scholars of English			
Shall we say something like mini Shantiniketan			
Yeah mini Shantiniketan but you know			
Dr Cyrian does not want to be name Shantiniketan to be			
given			
Uhn			
Because he says that uh the the terms that that there are			
no one word university and the campus of Shantiniketan			
 as far as the one word 			
Ah ha			
So that's the reason why he perhaps doesn't			
like the name of Shantiniketan to be given 			
But that's that's another matter			
No no see			
Anyway we we we always like to associate you know our own			
perception of Shantiniketan our own uh you know			
memory of Shantiniketan with what we saw at uh 			
 one word 			
True the campus is simply beautiful 			
 Beautiful 			
True 			
Uh we had trip to Ooty some shall we say about ten			
days ten fifteen days back			
Almost fifteen days back			
Fifteen days back			
Now uhm there is a certain problems for arranging this but			
after having arranged it and after having visited Ooty what do you think			
about your our visit ?			
Was it uh hurrying trip to Ooty or do you think that well it			
was very succesful trip to Ooty ?			
Oh I think it went off very well 			
Uh the weather was fine extremely good that day			
 Fine 			
And it was cloudy but it didn't rain			
Yeah			
And it uh I think we very much enjoyed the scenery			
Yeah 			
There was sunshine for sometime at one word 			
Ah and uh uh we were able to go round and see the			
important stops			
Uh yes			
And important spots			
Yes 			
Incidently you know later on from the photograph I discovered			
that we have missed out on two very important point			
Oh really oh oh yeah what are they ?			
 Yeah 			
You see we they didn't take us around the childrens park			
Oh I see			
It seems Ooty has uh many nice childrens			
park you know so 			
 One or two words 			
And the other one			
We missed out on that 			
And there is uh one telescope house it seems			
Oh I see 			
So we weren't taken to that spot			
Yeah I think 			
These two spots were missed out			
Missed out on those two 			
But don't you think that we visited a very wonderful and very			
important one word the botanical garden			
That was wonderful 			
That was really marvellous marvellous 			
 Marvellous 			
Breath takingly beautiful I should say 			
And uh I mean we didn't feel like coming out of it even			
we spent an hour an quarter perhaps			
Oh yes 			
That was beautiful garden uh			
That lake also that lake Ooty lake 			
 Lake 			
Ooty lake also 			
But this was much better			
Yeah yeah 			
But I didn't like the lake as much I like uhm 			
botanical garden especially the way it was maintained along 			
and uh			
 Yeah 			
In fact uh 			
Yes the bowers and uh that it did better than uh			
Sky growing trees 			
Better than the Brindavan garden I should say 			
 Yeah yeah and uh Brindavan garden			
And nurseries			
Yes hardly thing anything in Brindavan garden that brings to			
my mind 			
Yeah that's right 			
Uh except for those you know side one word 			
 It's all giddish talking of life and you know that			
 mu musical fountain 			
Yeah 			
But for that there is hardly anything in the 			
Brindavan garden you know and you know sprawling that way			
 Brindavan 			
Yeah			
But you know the variety of variety of flowers 			
 Brindavan garden doesn't offer you much 			
No but this botanic garden at at Ooty is simply			
marvellous			
Marvellous 			
Regarding variety of colours of and and 			
kind of flowers kind of trees			
 And and 			
 I'm glad we were able to make it that day			
Yeah yeah and fortunately the weather co-operated with us			
Yeah 			
That wasn't it wasn't much crowded either 			
Because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it 			
 ah ha much			
 Ah ha 			
It all went up very well 			
And uh later on we came to know that the chief minister of			
Tamil Nadu uh visited uh at same day I see and			
perhaps the things were well say in order then 			
Uh these streets were clean and uh there were boards and			
banners welcoming the chief minister of Tamil Nadu			
 I see 			
I see			
Dr Jaylalitha uh 			
Yes			
And perhaps it was an advantage because uh I don't			
know whether we were prevented from entering one word 			
area 			
 One word 			
I think good shape 			
Yes they think they will have a good shape 			
 One or two words 			
Yeah 			
No but you know uh normally I think yeah 			
they must be maintaining it very well			
 Yeah 			
 That's right			
I think that's it uh 			
Either way we had we had a very nice time there 			
in the park			
 Indeed 			
Indeed 			
Yeah indeed 			
And uh we also return in time big thing			
Yeah 			
Uh well we left this place around seven yeah			
 and we were back home by seven			
 Yeah 			
Yeah and 			
You remember that uh it started raining when we were nearly			
 outskirt of Mysore 			
Mysore yes 			
Yes and uh well uh we really succeeded in 			
organising and enjoying our our Sunday in ooty dated to			
 Ah that Ooty 			
Dated to the 			
Yes of course 			
When did you go to the U UK 			
So uh what are you to say about your Marxism and things like			
that 			
Marxism is supposed to one word 			
Uhm 			
When did you first start reading on Marxism actually 			
Well I didn't read at all 			
I think it was from my locality that I I got			
the idea			
Uhm because you happened to be with Marxist you thought it			
is a very good ideology 			
Well I didn't know anything about ideology aspects 			
in the beginning uhm 			
In my place I mean in our locality there were			
people who were not who called some some Marxists uhm			
And they had a peculiar way uhm which attracted			
me			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 What are that what are that 			
peculiar way 			
Well you know the so called co-operation uhm			
 the way they see with the way they treat people uhm			
 the way they talk the way they behave 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
So this this attracted you 			
You struct your something yeah uh which			
which the other ideologists didn't had 			
 Yeah 			
Yes 			
Uhm is that 			
 That's what I think 			
Which means that uh if you were brought up in a different			
 en environment say for example among the Christians or among 			
among the Muslims or among among the Jains and Buddhists say you			
would have accepted that ideology			
No no no because you know uh I was among the			
Christians I was among the Hindus uhm but neither			
Christianity nor Hinduism affected me uhm 			
Only this particular way of living as we call			
 it is the Marxist way way of living it			
only attracted me 			
Because it had something speciality uhm uhm 			
Something this something that uhm that 			
that makes it uh distinct from Hinduism or Christianity			
I do not like Hinduism and I do not like Christianity 			
But I like Marxism because it makes a man think about people			
It makes a man think about his own fellow men and also about			
his place in the world 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Well what has Marx to say about the things which happened 			
before eighteen what is it seventeen eighty wh when was Marx			
born seventeen eighty eighty-three eighty-five			
No no Marx was born in the 			
Well I think			
Nineteenth century but Marxism Marxism			
began with Marxism began with property 			
Marxism lived through uh no no plight okay			
 uhm 			
It was a democrator and then that this was followed by 			
a generation of thinkers and finally uh it came to Hegel 			
Hegel had his views 			
And then Marx Marx had his own views and he developed into			
 an ideology 			
The form that we have now			
 Uh no no 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 One word uh that's fine 			
Well how does a marxism help you in your class uh in			
your teaching whether it it help you 			
Will it help you to teach Shakespeare or uh language 			
 Does it help you 			
 Well we can look at Shakespeare from uh a Marxist			
angle for example in Hamlet we can we can			
 uh take the case of Hamlet 			
 Hamlet sees the fall of his mother			
 uhm not of the fault of that particular individual 			
 uhm but as the defect of the world in general 			
This is the Bourgeois approach to human experience 			
An individual experience cannot be the experience of 			
everybody in this world uhm 			
So in that way one cannot according to Marxist thinkers			
 one cannot universalise a on a particular experience			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm uhm so once you explain a text			
like this uh			
 So 			
When we explain a text like Shakespeare uh a			
Shakespearean play the interpretation will be in that way 			
uhn			
 One or two words 			
Okay how does it help you in your teaching of language 			
Well there is no answer			
Uhm how does it help you in your family life 			
Talking to your wife and children 			
 Family life in family life it helps a lot			
 uhm 			
Because in Indian society uhm which			
follows one a particular system uhm 			
I mean a male dominated Indian society uhm			
Uh it's rigid uhm 			
And Marxism makes it flexible			
We uh we are told to look at women in a way we should			
look at a humanity			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 That's what even feminism says 			
Feminism didn't say anything very different			
Oh feminism may be imitating the Marxist 			
Uhm uhm uhm 			
So why did it fail in Russia 			
Why 			
Why did it fail in Russia 			
Why did it fail in Russia 			
See it was the fault was not with Marxism 			
It wasn't with it was not with Marx			
It was with the people who were in Power 			
 There They were corrupt 			
 If it is applicable to Marxism is not			
applicable to any other ism then 			
Well I'm not aware of any other ism at present			
Why Marxism failed in Russia is an open question 			
People have been discussing for a long time 			
And people			
Once you say that there is something wrong			
with the people 			
And nothing wrong with an ideology 			
 Know 			
There wasn't anything wrong with the Russian the			
ideology that Russians had 			
Well the people in power were wrong			
They went wrong 			
And they and their system two word 			
And the foreign intervention intervention from the part of			
 American and all other capitalist nations were also there 			
They were trying for a long time to destroy the Soviet Union			
since its inception in uh in nineteen seventeen 			
They have been trying for a long time to destroy the set- up			
Well Stalin with his iron hands could uh prevent the			
Soviet set-up from destruction 			
But the later rulers couldn't 			
 If any other ideology one or two words 			
Uhm one word it's okay uhm			
Can a thing be prevented with iron hands 			
Yes many things could be prevented with iron hands			
Means they are prevented			
For example that was what that was what Stalin Stalin			
did in Russia uhn			
 But if they are prevented with iron hands what 			
Or if something is prevented with iron hands 			
uhn it means uhn the person who prevents 			
uhn is likely to be again uhn destroyed by iron hands			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
Suppose someone is going to destroy your society and			
suppose there is strong person with a very strong force to protect			
the society well he is doing a good job 			
He is saving the society 			
So that was exactly what Stalin did in Russia 			
 But those who oppose			
You know the			
But those who oppose if you destroy them uhn 			
then it means that you are doing a something good for the society 			
 Uhn 			
Yes if the society has a cancer of hand it has to be cut			
Who is going to decide 			
It is the people 			
If it is the people then other people had any voice			
Well			
If is a person goes on destroying everyone			
Communism cannot succeed without the support of the people			
That was what happened in Kerala			
For example Marxsism failed in Kerala and West Bengal 			
Why did it fail in Kerala and West Bengal 			
Because it wasn't a popular movement 			
So communism failed not communism Marxism fail in			
Kerala in West Bengal also the movement failed 			
It was because the those people who who were the 			
opponents of that particular movement uh could not influence people 			
Okay fine			
Means uh if if it failed in Russia uhm it			
means people are not with Communism 			
 Uhm 			
People are still with communism in Russia 			
You know the way they uh the way they executed communism			
 I mean the how they practised communism that was wrong 			
In what sense it is one word 			
What sense it is			
What what those who are in power uhn 			
then they have something like politbureau yeah and the			
members of the politbureau ahn infact again become			
previleged people			
 Uhn 			
 Yeah 			
 Ahn 			
Ah yeah that was there 			
 And if they become previleged people 			
 corruption you'll find ball is in their hand			
 Corruption 			
Yeah that is that is corruption 			
It means any ism for that matter ultimately leads to			
hurt			
See there is nothing called ultimate 			
Because you know these people went wrong 			
Who went wrong 			
 E E this people those people who were at			
the helm of affairs 			
 Those who were the as you pointed out 			
 ah supporters of communism 			
 Ah 			
Not supporters of communism			
The people who were in power for example in Russia 			
there was Gorbochov 			
 But who comes in power 			
Now actually these people			
 He he accepted the prize who got the Nobel			
Prize			
 No no 			
Uhm			
Why did he accept the Nobel Prize 			
What was Bernard Shaw's reaction when he was awarded			
the Nobel Prize 			
Bernard Shaw was not a pure communist but this man Gorbochov			
 secretary of the C P S U accepted the noble prize 			
And who are noble uhm the inventor of uh			
weapon intended to destroy humanity 			
Marxism stands for humanity 			
It is for the preservation of humanity 			
And this man Gorbochov accepted a medal meant for the			
 capitalist profit motivated people 			
So in that way he was going 			
 Uhm 			
 Any person who comes into power he comes			
because of popular support 			
But once he comes into power he becomes power crazy power			
greedy			
He is after more and more power and ultimately what happens he			
finds everything is centred in him and because of that uh again 			
he goes at basic principles of one word 			
See this was not what happened in the Soviet Union 			
You may know about uh that Perestroika and Glasnot			
 See see and there but there also again what			
happens we find that members of the politbureau they were previleged			
people there ah 			
But with if Marx was under 			
 Ah 			
 That was not so in the past			
And the society in which there are one word he			
wants to have a classless society 			
And that dream he had 			
Well uh I do not agree 			
Okay fine I think we talk about something else uhm			
uhm			
How did you enjoy your stay here 			
I enjoyed your company very much 			
Why 			
Because you know it is a very different sort of experience			
Because in our state it is uh raining uhm			
 and it is very unpleasant uhm 			
We can not sit like this and chat because of the uh tanned			
 atmosphere and uh chill uhm 			
So you know in that way and uh again it's a			
change uhn uhn from the what we have been doing there 			
Now I'm in a different atmosphere uh both physically			
and mentally 			
And so uh uh I feel that I can enjoy it 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah how did you enjoy your stay here 			
Very fine to be here in company of 			
Fine ka matlab 			
Well			
How fine 			
Because all the while I was in the company of very nice			
people uhm educated again refined those who have			
very nice ideas to propogate hm hm hm and			
 Uhm 			
 Hm hm hm 			
Well in that way you too have an idea to propogate 			
You propogate Hinduism and he propogates uh Islam			
 Islam 			
 Islam 			
Uh yes uh you have recently been to your 			
yeah family yeah what about your children wife 			
how are they			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
In fact uh my son and daughter they had asked me to			
buy buy them uhm this thing the sunglasses			
Have they missed you a lot 			
Yeah they did miss me in fact they were waiting for their			
sunglasses			
As soon as I went home my son asked me uh asked me for the			
sunglasses 			
Luckily I bought bought two bought two 			
For the one the one I bought for my son was very loose 			
So he always wearing it and slipped on his nose and he was 			
uh he asked me one or two words putting in back 			
Then when my daughter it fitted very well 			
So luckily I I could I could bring I can buy them			
If not I would have had a tough time 			
Then then my daughter wanted some jewels something like that			
She she cried she wanted jewel somethings like that 			
Then I promised to buy some silk sarees for for			
my wife from Mysore			
Then she she wasn't very keen			
She said okay fine			
I think I get good one to buy 			
Then my wife's sister also wanted a saree			
Then two of her sisters also wanted sarees so I			
 now I have to buy about four six sarees from here 			
These are going to come about four thousand rupees			
 I think I'll have to spent 			
So yes I one or two words you don't worry yes I can			
get get the whole thing for about three thousand five hundred even that 			
I'll find 			
So I'm just thinking what I should do			
What 			
But then of course I have a hell of time travelling uh I			
mean from here to Erode and Erode to Trinavelli and Trinavelli to uh			
once again to Ooty 			
No this is in Mysore stays and here and back			
Rather bit too much 			
For for first time I've been experiencing so much of			
trouble travelling			
Now after month of travelling sitting in a bus and for two			
nights continously a bit too much 			
But then I really think whether whether I should have been taking			
so much of trouble 			
This one month uh I mean my I mean my OD OD not not I			
mean not being sanctioned till now 			
 One word Sushila 			
 So Shushilaji when are we leaving to your place			
 I'm leaving on the twenty ninth of one			
word 			
 What is your impression of Mysore last year 			
and whether you like 			
 Mysore is a beautiful city 			
I liked it very much 			
I never imagined that it's a beautiful city 			
Perhaps because I stayed in Lucknow Hostel and even 			
Yeah Lucknow used to be very very hot 			
And when I came to Mysore I came here with the			
intention of visiting a new city 			
I didn't have any idea about the weather in Mysore 			
When I reached Bangalore uh I asked my sister how Mysore			
would be like and she said that uh well it would be as good as			
Bengal 			
Now I come to know that my sister was uh right in a way			
But you know 			
Now			
I don't know about Sushila she is she one or two words			
 all that and Asok is also 			
Now I see you can we one word uh it			
proved to be a bit cough troublesome for me Sushila of			
course you are there and I'm surrounded by friends like			
you and Patil and Asok and all that 			
I don't miss my home as much 			
But even then one word made			
quite long one or two words 			
 Now 			
 One month is a long time to be away from			
home 			
And especially food and when you come back to my			
to your room uh you don't exactly like a warm that's 			
 Yeah especially in the evening when you			
returned from from the institute you feel rather home sick 			
yeah yeah 			
To enter the empty room when nobody is there to 			
 Yeah yeah 			
Of course with Sushila with with neighbour you			
 there is a kind of compensation kind of uh sisterly daughterly			
 yeah persons that the cheerful charming sweet and all			
that 			
But then we know that this is a kind of a medicine 			
 yeah the family insists on but it is illusion			
 I know 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Suddenly you begin to feel early in evening she is always			
there 			
But you know up to the twenty first of June I think you got			
 whole long Sushila			
Yeah			
And now when I'm as if I'm out of			
job because the part of job it is yeah 			
 Part of job it is yeah 			
Before she a few words 			
 A few words 			
There is no worry formerly I used to think about my lesson			
moreover what shall I talk			
Exactly exactly to keep you busy			
Yeah it kept me mentally busy and now I'm 			
attending this classes 			
Unless I must say			
I have got nothing else nothing to do 			
So in first the first thing that seem one word 			
I would I will say participate like that			
 It clearly give it a hope 			
 Hope hope you know			
I just I just missed it all hope now this is no			
 eat for getting to missed it so the only thing is that 			
I don't know but I think uh			
It was a very good experience uh 			
Yeah 			
 A few words 			
We had a nice time together all of us 			
And this evening we spent about half an hour uh uh with			
Sushila uh talking about the sarees that she one			
word 			
The blanket on a blanket 			
Blanket with the shawl that she has done 			
And my one word we started talking about uh			
colours patterns and one or two words 			
 We're just allowed because one or two			
words 			
 Which colour will go with that person 			
And uh by the by the way it is interesting that that's 			
we've got this thing about the Indian beauty 			
Especial reference to women and uh Sushila was one of			
the main person but she didn't feel embarrassed laughter 			
A statement about her and uh			
Short nose tall uh reminding of uh classical			
 upbringing and all that she's from Madras			
That was a very compliment comp comprehending			
with uh historical persons 			
Complimenting compliment uh compliment they are true 			
Otherwise she would feel uh furious 			
There is no embarrassing thinking but uhm these are the			
features and especially the sharp long nose and I think of that			
Who is this lady ?			
Uh I don't have uh Rajasthani painting uh Kishangarh			
school and all that 			
You will find that uh most uh women who are usually			
dressed as they were queens uh people of royal family they acted			
like a you know each and one or two words cough 			
Unless you think of it you you relaxed when it loses us			
 it occurred to me there is something there 			
And I wouldn't fall on it 			
But today we started talking about it and then you know uh 			
you get uh uh uh a few words 			
So uh now that I'm leaving on the twenty seventh			
 a few words 			
And you are all alone 			
How long uh will be your journey uh perhaps			
Actually if I leave this place and go straight to Burdwan			
then it won't take uh uh very long time compare to other such thing like			
Longest longest longest way 			
 Longest 			
 It's about uh sixty-five hours but I'm 			
going via Hyderabad because I'm leaving on the twenty-fifth			
evening 			
Are you going to stay there or ?			
Yeah I'll stay there for five days from			
twenty-eight to second			
Third morning I'll be going to one word and			
I will be reaching home on fourth 			
You are leaving on the twenty-ninth 			
Yeah I'm leaving on the twenty-ninth			
What time ?			
 I'm uh at two forty-five that much one			
word two forty-five 			
 It's straight from Mysore to			
Straight from Mysore to uh Dharwad			
Dharwad 			
So called the Mysore one or two words 			
It doesn't go to via Bangalore 			
No it doesn't 			
It goes via Arsikeri Hubli and Warangal 			
And you are not going back right now 			
I think you'll be making trip to 			
Like travelling travelling to Salem this			
places at Salem and one word 			
But everything will lack one word when I am in			
Bangalore in my sister because uh now is my problem I find I			
would have to yeah take care of lots of things			
 Salem 			
Yeah			
Then it was a			
Cannot move that on the way 			
Yeah yeah depends upon the reservation train time and 			
a few words 			
And uh though there are one word although uh I wish			
 I would make it 			
In fact I'll 			
So that is how 			
You are going to one word children			
Yes			
Straight away Dharwad			
The way they are very good 			
They know one or two words 			
 one word only with husband or with			
your husband and children

So the other two			
Yeah there are two other and I miss them one word

 younger one most

It is funny to miss your wife you miss your children most 			
 That's right 			
But if you tell you miss your wife uh he will not

My name is K M John 			
 I'm very glad to meet you 			
 I'm Thomas 			
I come from the southern part of Kerala			
Oh you're also from Kerala			
Yeah that is			
Yes I'm I'm also from Kerala			
Uh I come from Trivandrum accha			
 uhm even though I'm settled in Trivandrum I I			
was born in the central Travancore			
 Accha 			
Yes I also belong to central Travancore sir			
That is true uh			
I belong to Kottayam district			
Uh ah it is nice to meet you Mr Thomas 			
Especially in this circumstances			
Ah uh uhm I thought and I'll tell you			
something about my experience as a teacher			
Very glad to hear sir			
Uh 			
Where were you working ?			
 For after my M A M A in English in nineteen			
sixty-eight I started teaching in a prestigious college in Trivandrum			
 Marvine co 			
 Sir you have a very long experience sir 			
as a teacher 			
 That is that is true 			
About more than twenty-five years now uh			
 I've been teaching for the last fifteen years 			
Fifteen years yeah 			
Uh you you have taught only in one college			
Only in one college 			
But my experience is varied 			
I taught for uh nine plus C S in Trivandrum in			
Marvines College Trivandrum 			
Then uh			
So naturally you are familiar with the Trivandrum politics and			
such a things 			
Yes yes uh lot you know because it was at the prime of			
my youth you know I was in Trivandrum			
So ?			
So I was very much interested in the uh student politics			
in watching how students take part in politics			
Very good sir 			
And also the various developments you know the 			
Communist government in Kerala 			
In sixty-eight you mean 			
That is true			
Uh in sixties-seven second communist ministry came into			
power			
Power in Kerala 			
Then uh the emergency period you know all this uh			
happened when I was			
During that emergency period you are were			
 in Trivandrum ?			
I was in Trivandrum 			
Infact I appreciated one aspect of emergency know our			
people were all disciplined			
 Haan disciplined 			
But of course freedom was curtailed you know 			
Some could arrest you and take you to the prison without			
questioning 			
But there was one thing I saw			
See one aspect is that in our state there was			
not not such a misuse of emergency			
 Yeah yeah 			
Ah ha ha that is true 			
Uhm I saw people you know in offices all going on time coming back			
on			
For we we didn't find it ve too much uh that			
troublesome			
Yes yes yes 			
I would like to tell you something about my experience as a			
teacher 			
 Yes sir continue sir 			
Uhm then perhaps you may you will tell me uh your			
experience about a teacher 			
Uh I told you that I taught for nine years in Trivandrum			
Yes sir 			
Then uhm I registered my name in the ministry of external			
affairs uh foreign assingnment section and uh when			
there was a chance for teachers in Nigeria the ministry supplied the			
names of teachers who have registered their names with the ministry 			
And I was called for an interview 			
Uhm they submitted the name in the Nigerian High Commission in			
Delhi and people from the High Commisssion came to Trivandrum to			
interview 			
And uh I was interviewed and I was selected for			
 Yes 			
Oh you were in Ni Nigeria			
Yes that is true uh for a teaching post			
Hey that is very nice experience			
Yeah 			
It was a very nice experience you know you are true 			
How many years did you spend there ?			
Uh I spent uh ten years			
Ten years			
Ten long years a decade 			
It was a pleasant experience because that uh there have			
been an opportunity to get exposed to people from different parts of the			
country			
Uhm in the past many teachers from our state went to Nigeria			
Ah ah some perhaps some of your relatives are			
there			
Yes them			
 Haan haan 			
 They've spent five years or at the maximum ten years			
there			
Ah ha ha 			
Then one one thing I enjoyed about my uh work in Nigeria			
was we had annual leave you know 			
After ten years we got two months leave and we could come			
home during those two months 			
And that Nigerian government paid for our travel and			
The other leave allowances			
Yes yes and other leave allowances			
So every year you had three or two months stay 			
 Every year I used to come yes yes 			
And it is not only for me for my whole family			
Ah yeah			
My wife and two children uh to and fro tickets 			
And uh that gave me an opportunity to travel through different			
countries visit uh			
Oh you visited other countries also			
Yes yes 			
If I number the countries I visited I think it is about			
twenty-three			
How laughs surprising			
Yeah that was one uh privilege I enjoyed uh uh by			
my service overseas 			
I could travel I could go to U S A to Canada to England 			
European many countries in Europe many countries in 			
Middle East and some countries in Africa 			
Apart from Nigeria I could travel through some other countries			
in Africa that there have been opportunity to visit many uh			
countries 			
So that gave me an opportunity to get exposed to 			
people 			
 Very good 			
 Then after that ten years service you			
returned to Trivandrum ?			
Yes yes 			
I went in the year nineteen seventy-seven and uh I returned			
in nineteen eighty-seven 			
And uh I was planning to settle down in Trivandrum I started			
constructing my house 			
There 			
Then yes that is true			
Then what happened ?			
Uh then something very providential happened			
 I'll call it providential because I never expected			
that such a thing will happen			
You are a believer 			
Yes I believe in uh God's plan in my life 			
And uh I saw an advertisement in one of the Indian Kerala			
newspaper about a post in Karnataka 			
And uhm naturally when I found that it was a post in ke			
 in a college in a degree college and I was eligible to apply			
I applied for it 			
And I waited for two months you know			
There was no reply but all of a sudden I got an invitation for			
interview 			
That happened			
Then the Karnataka college			
From Karnataka college 			
I had never travelled to Karnataka 			
It was the first time I travelled to Karnataka 			
Though you have visited twenty-seven foreign nations			
Yes yes I I visited many countries in uh all			
over the world but I I had yet to discover India you know 			
So I got an opportunity to travel to Karnataka for my			
interview 			
That was in the month of May ninety			
Seventy-seven			
Uh nineteen eighty eighty-eight			
Eighty-eight			
Yes 			
Then after the interview they asked me to join in the			
month of July 			
So I joined the college 			
As principal ?			
Uh not exactly			
I was appointed as a Reader in English 			
There was another principal when I joined			
They had another principal means two principals laughs			
That is no I was not appointed as a principal then 			
And it also happened providentially I will say because the 			
then Principal he wanted to go for higher studies in England 			
He took one mon one years leave and uh went to			
England 			
Then uh I was the senior most person in the college and so 			
they asked me to			
So you were promoted 			
Uh yes I I was asked to be the acting Principal for one			
year until he returned 			
Then uh when he returned he didn't want to take charge as a			
Principal 			
He did not receive his responsibility 			
Did he continued as a teacher ?			
Uh uh beg your pardon			
The that that fellow			
No no no uhm he he returned and the management was			
running a school 			
Uh infact the school is a prestigious school uh with more			
than two thousand students 			
And he took over as the Principal of the school			
And the mantle fell on me and I became the Principal			
 In charge 			
 Principal yes			
So that was in nineteen eighty-nine 			
And from eighty-nine onwards I'm the Principal in that			
college 			
Then you tell me something about your experience as 			
teacher as a teacher ?			
 Yeah yeah sir 			
My experience is not that of a Principal laughs or			
anything like that you know the background			
Yes 			
And the situation in Kerala 			
There are many teachers there			
 Accha 			
I got this appointment in nineteen eighty-one 			
As a lecturer there			
Yes 			
After taking my degree from Indore 			
Ah ha you told me once you told me that 			
I took my M A from Indore University			
Ah ha ha 			
Then naturally I had to seek for a job for a four			
years			
Ah ha 			
So I got this appointment in eighty-one 			
Ah ha 			
Then joined as a lecturer ju junior lecturer			
that practice was there			
Yeah 			
And for last fifteen years I've been working			
there			
Ah ha			
So now I'm posted as a that senior grade			
lecturer			
Ah ha 			
After the implementation of U G C that you know it			
happened in nineteen ninety			
Ah ha 			
And you know uh everything about uh 			
this Kerala and our Raichin our that particular aspects 			
 yeah though you were away from Kerala for a long time			
 Uh 			
 Yeah 			
Yes every year I was coming and I uh sliding down 			
And we are very happy or we are actually proud of our			
state uhm because people are there all over the world from			
our state uhm uhm 			
Then if you go to every part of India to any part of India you			
can notice that there are Malyalis			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uh not only India every part of the world you know 			
 ahn 			
Some people commented that if you go to the moon you know there			
will be a Malyali there 			
So now with a cofee shop and 			
 Ahn 			
 Malyali 			
 This this shows our adventurous natures			
sometimes as sometimes our that test for you can work such a thing			
 uhn anyhow then we have also we have that			
political adventures also ah uhm 			
Have you heard of the political that recent election results			
 Uhn 			
 Ah uhm 			
Ah yes I that yes I heard			
 That 			
For every fifty years what happens that there is a turn in			
 political alliance there ah ha 			
This time the Left Front have came in power			
Once again our Nayanar he is the chief minister there 			
 yes the one this is his third uh that term yeah			
 as chief minister			
Actually this people expected that some other would be the			
chief minister ah ha but in politics you can not expect			
anything			
 Ah ha 			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Yes the one 			
 Yeah 			
 Ah ha 			
Yeah that is real politics laughs 			
So but this the samething is happening there you just see 			
do you know the dilemma of the Kerala politicians now or that the			
Congress is in opposition there ah ha 			
The Marxist are ruling yeah but at the same time			
 they are both these parties are supporting the 			
yeah I know Deve Gowda ministry yeah in the centre 			
so 			
And we now have enough rain sir			
 Ah ha 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah I know 			
 Yeah 			
Ah ha in abundant in Kerala			
Start raining uh			
 Abundant 			
In first week of June			
Uh when you left Kerala it was raining			
Ah it is it is sir			
Even now it is raining			
Ah it is raining I I've letters from my family			
 members sir and it is described that rains are heavy			
there yeah going on			
 Ah ha uhm 			
 Yeah 			
My family is staying in Karnataka 			
Ah your family is in Karnataka			
Yeah they call me every night and they say the rains have not			
yet started			
Ah the people complain that 			
 It's just like Maharashtra it is			
just like here 			
It has not yet started 			
And see I have noticed some other things that is			
that many parts of Karnataka are exactly like our Kerala yeah			
 the trees the or those flowers and everything			
 Yeah 			
Ah ha			
The coconut plants are actually it was our property that			
coconut ah ha now it has become on all India			
 Ah ha 			
Yeah you can see coconut trees all over the coastal areas 			
from Bombay			
Our Kerala is actually known as the land of coconuts then			
I have you have noticed all those coconuts plants sir			
Yeah in Karnataka also coconuts are plenty 			
 Every kind of tree I noticed 			
Uh in Goa and in Karnataka			
 Uh it is there 			
Somebody told me that this there is a region known			
as Konkan area here in Maharashtra and there you can have			
every kind of agricultural products that that we have			
 Yeah it is that yeah 			
Ah ha coconuts you know in in our place Karnataka			
when I say our place it is Karnataka now since I'm settled there			
Tender coconuts are more popular than ripe 			
 coconuts 			
 Than 			
 Ripe one 			
But in Kerala we do not use that much tender one sir			
Ah yes yes and even a doctors say when you go			
the hospital uhn they'll prescribe tender			
coconut even as a medicine ah yes and it is supposed to be			
 panacea for all diseases you know 			
So people			
 Uhn 			
 Ah yes 			
Now we've already actually we've turned			
it to rubber ahn rubber plantation			
 Ahn 			
Yeah yes yes 			
Coconuts are not that plantation is not a profitable one			
now			
Ah ha 			
Rubber is some what profitable now			
Yeah 			
I think now we get above fifty rupees per			
kilogram			
Per kilo ah 			
 It's reasonable 			
Uhm you too have you too have rubber			
plantation in your			
 Though 			
Yes yes yes man then you know very well that we all the			
Keralites even though we have only ten cents of land there 			
 everybody plants rubber there			
rubber plant 			
So uhm I am Mr Shinde 			
I am Mrs Heema Patil			
Patil			
Uhm 			
So we uhm in fact we are concerned about so many			
things now a days that we have to be talk about environment and			
 uh the onset of western civilisation uh western gadgets 			
What do you think about uh what will happen in this India 			
 what do what do you feel about that 			
About environment			
Yes 			
Uh sir the position of today environment is not so			
good			
Uhm			
So I feel that the future is very dark according to me			
It is dark 			
So you think that uh unless people become aware 			
 haan of the future problem uhn			
 it will be very dark			
 Haan 			
 Uhn 			
 Haan 			
So what has made you think uh like this 			
Uhn sir whenever I see uhn some paper and other			
information			
Uhm 			
Then I feel that uh the air pollution is going on			
increasing			
Uhm 			
Uhm it's due to our bomb blast uhn			
 blast uhn and other things uhn these			
are going uh to add uhn the crisis 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
Yeah 			
 That's I feel that the future is dark			
It is			
There is noise pollution because of these uh refregerator			
heating uhm like industrial development uhm			
 perhaps even the management of natural resources			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Uh these are uhn making adverse effect on the			
environment			
On the environment			
So I feel that the future is very dark			
Future is very dark 			
So I think you mean uh to put in very few words you			
mean that you are we are depriving our children from yes 			
pure nature uhm			
 Yes 			
Yes uh we are not uh			
 So in fact 			
We are criminals			
Ah handing over uh 			
We are not handing over as it has come to us			
 No the 			
Uhn as it has come to us 			
 As it has come to us 			
So you you think of the past 			
Yes 			
And your childhood			
Uhn 			
Uhn			
Comparing with the childhood uh uh we were enjoying			
the fresh and pure air			
Uh uhn 			
But uh at present uh the children are deprived of those			
happy days			
Uhn uhn			
Those fresh and pure air and many other things			
Uhn 			
Because of this changing culture uhm because			
of this noise pollution			
 Uhm 			
Yes 			
Uh they are deprived of the pleasures which are			
derived from the nature			
Yes 			
So it has to do with culture also			
Culture also 			
So uhm what do you say about uh this strange thing			
that our religion our culture our past if we go to our past			
We have gods and goddesses haan 			
whom we worshipped haan you know 			
They are uh they represent nature			
 Haan 			
 Haan 			
Nature			
Uhn then why this uh why people worship on the			
one on the one hand but they behave very 			
in a contradictory manner then take 			
 According to me sir they have not the exact			
idea of religion			
Uhn 			
Uh if I suppose that religion is uh just like uh 			
Buddhism Jainism uhm Hinduism uhm but			
actually the religion according to me it is based on uh it should			
be based on science			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhn 			
Uhm according to me religion means uh the property 			
 uhm of the thing uhm which it			
possesses it			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Yes 			
For example this wood possesses the molecules uh 			
That it will burn			
Uhn it will burn			
It is soft it can be uhn it can moulded			
 yes			
 It is bended uhn it is soft 			
Moulded 			
It is the religion of this uh wood			
Yeah this wood uhn 			
If there is a metal then it is malleable it is ductile			
So what is the religion of man now then 			
 This is the property of 			
Then 			
At present			
Uhn the religion of soul is uh the knowledge 			
 uhn highest knowledge uhn and inspiration			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
Uhn 			
And uh means soul possesses this qualities			
Yes 			
The body if the body is separated from it 			
uhm then body possess the uh colour uhm then 			
fame uhm uh what are these in Marathi as you say the			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Gandha 			
 Rakta Gandha Varha these			
are the rakta uh dharma 			
or the qualities of this soul 			
 That's why people must know uhm that uh			
 what is the real religion of the man			
 Uh 			
 Rakta 			
 Uh uh uh 			
 Uhm 			
Uhn			
And they should not collect this shouldn't run after this 			
uh material progress			
Uh hoarding haan they should			
not hoard			
 Haan 			
 Haan hoard			
Uhn uh that is the basic cause of even			
adding into pollution			
 This is uhn 			
Pollution			
 Haan 			
If they do not start uh possessing all these things then			
hoarding all this things uhn uh perhaps they will 			
understand the real nature of this religion 			
And they will try to gain that pure uh enjoyment 			
uh ha from the religion			
 Uhn uh 			
 Uh ha 			
 Uhn uh 			
That is true uh that is true 			
If we can feel you see so that means if more and more			
people uhn understand understand the real			
nature of religion based on science science and not on			
superstitious superstitious uhn and that does not also			
mean that they should carried away by some crazy western ideas			
 Uh 			
 Uhn 			
 Understand 			
 Science 			
 Superstitious 			
Yes 			
They should go to our past			
Our past 			
And uh to think on these things and try to change			
Change 			
So what			
A real sir uh according to me uh this religion uh			
 do not tell us uhm does not tell us uhm			
 that uh we should uh kill anybody			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm so ahimsa is the most			
important principle			
 Uh 			
Means uh of uh in case of this plant if we hurt			
it uhm means if we destroy it uhm 			
then the important uh uh element of the nature is destroyed			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Destroyed			
And the this uh what are they called advantage of			
uh that plant as uh are also destroyed			
 Are 			
They are extinct uh like animals are 			
extinct plants are also getting yeah that is true			
 That's the haan 			
 You should not hurt it 			
All this life uh like that 			
 The other day we were we were discussing			
about haan somebody told us that 			
 haan the hybridisation of rice is not possible now			
 Haan 			
 Haan 			
Yeah			
Some thirty thousand uh species were there and now there			
are only			
Only 			
Eight hundred			
Uhn eight hundred 			
About eight hundred natural species 			
 Ah ha ha 			
That means we are really depriving our own future			
 Every individual has uh important role 			
 yes to play in this environment			
 Yes 			
And we are killing that			
Ahn we are killing that 			
That is uh that is the reality 			
 Not knowing the real reason 			
Yes that way also			
Yes sir means uh we should remain uh free from all			
passion			
Uhn 			
Means hatred killing uhm e 			
extreme jealous yeah all these things			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
Going going to the extreme of any passion			
Any passion 			
We should try to uhn uh have equiliberium			
 Uhn 			
Equiliberium 			
And only to have as much as is uhn necessary			
 essential			
 Uhn 			
Essential			
Essential that			
If we try to reduce our uh needs uhm then			
 we'll have to get this supreme satisfaction joy			
 Uhm 			
 Joy 			
Joy so 			
If people understand this religion then there will be no			
pollution there will be no noise pollution or sound pollution			
Uhm 			
Uh because of this uh more and more needs			
Uhm uhm 			
And people are becoming becoming more and more greedy			
Yes 			
They are facing all these material pleasure and uh 			
that's that's why they these are the factories 			
coming up and that's why these prices are also zooming up			
 Yes yes 			
Yes 			
So if we try to understand our needs uh reduce our			
 cough minimise our needs			
Uhm 			
Then we will not uh produce all these things			
Yes that is true			
So then there will be no problem of pollution and all			
these 			
Yes			
People will happily			
Yes 			
So this type of an education should be given then 			
from the primary stage 			
 Should be given right from the primary stage			
Yeah primary stage ah			
So I think Maharashtra government has uhm 			
they have started this uh this subject 			
 Uhm 			
 Ahn they have added one topic uh			
One topic			
Uh 			
On envi 			
In pollution in science book I saw			
Ah ha ha 			
In science book			
So they had they are taking it seriously now			
Ah seriously			
Atleast on the subjects 			
In uh			
You see that they are 			
Uh mean they they are when they uh came to know			
 uhm about it's uh adverse effect			
 Uhm 			
Yes 			
So 			
Impending danger 			
Uhn impending			
Now they are uh			
 That's why			
Now they are becoming aware of that 			
But it is all in the hands of uh our representatives 			
who do not know much about			
 Ahn 			
Much about			
The the dangers if the teachers and 			
intellectuals if they organise			
Ahn 			
And uh go to the society uhn like that			
trying to impart			
 Uhn 			
Yes ahn 			
They went to the masses 			
Uhm 			
Do you think that the intellectuals go to the masses at			
present 			
Uhm I do not think so 			
No they are worried about their own 			
 Think so ah they ahn uhn 			
Own quest or own uh they are running after			
their job			
 Running for 			
Identity 			
Ah they don't have their own identity			
 Id ahn 			
But on the other hand I think it is			
They have the wrong notion of their intellect 			
 haan I feel			
 Haan 			
Yes so they are not real intellectual you mean			
Intellectual intellectuals do not feel any proud of their			
knowledge			
Yes 			
Because knowledge is so vast yes that uh uh			
 Yes 			
You cannot grasp			
We possess only ahn 			
We we only possess the tip of the iceberg			
Tip ahn yes			
Like that			
Like that 			
So don't you think it is very uh significant thing to			
 uh notice uhn that if we when we think of			
religion ahn or the ideas about religion that you talked			
about ahn which takes us back to uh looking at our own			
body ahn and nature and balance in that 			
ahn and then we can have a peaceful and uh pleasurable life			
 Uhn 			
 Ahn 			
 Ahn 			
 Ahn 			
 Ahn 			
Ahn			
Uhm so these are the ideas which have come from			
Indian side			
Uhn			
Religions from this side 			
But uh at present what we see is people who geographically are			
here ahn are not aware of these ideas			
 Ahn 			
No			
But those who live in other countries ahn 			
like western countries			
 Ahn 			
Ahn			
Uh who are very affluent countries			
Affluent			
But they are borrowing ideas from Indian religions and			
Yes I have heard that uh some people they are also			
 uhn accepting this uh non violence			
Uhm			
They are building up these uhm uh temples			
there			
 Uhm 			
Yes yes 			
And some of them have started following this path also			
Uhm uhm			
So in that case they are means uh 			
They are 			
Ah uhn			
Now in fact they are following it			
Following it 			
And very sincerly 			
I have read in the paper			
Uhm uhm so that is the happy thing			
Many peo many people have come to some times			
and they were asking about uh this religion uhn and what			
is the philosophy of this uh Indian culture and all this			
 Uhn 			
Uhn I know they do ask about these things 			
That time we uh felt ashamed of our people			
Uhm 			
And I remember here once we met uh Miss			
Martin			
 So many here uh 			
Uhm			
From England and Sheril Hiper from America			
Uhm 			
Came to this uh Backsinger memorial library			
Uhm uhm 			
And like means uh means at that time I used to go 			
for conversational classes			
Uhm uhm that means you you were going			
 you used to go for to teach			
 I met 			
No 			
Learn 			
Ahn learn			
Learn English ah ha			
 English 			
Ah before uh com means uh 			
Before you join your M A 			
Ah M A 			
See yesterday I ran into Smita 			
So uhm her friend Laxshmi she was suffering from her father			
was suffering from asthama 			
So here he has been admitted in the Hospital somewhere in			
Rajarampuri 			
So			
Who is the doctor 			
Some Irani Irani 			
So I checked the reports of his blood you know all were			
normal 			
But the doctor is saying there's a pu puss			
formation in the lungs			
Yeah 			
So I asked him I asked him what treatment does			
 is he going to give 			
So his thinking is that it can be removed only by surgery 			
But we can do even homeopathy for that			
Yeah I know 			
 Homeopathy is the best treatment you know 			
 I've even I was telling her the same thing 			
But then she said ki I said see the puss			
formation is going to take place again after the surgery uhm			
And asthama is such a disease that it can be			
completely cured by homeopathy only			
 Uhm 			
 Disease 			
 Homeopathy 			
You just ad advise her then if if she wants			
But her father you know he he is against restrictions of			
eating and drinking like he wants to drink coffee all the			
time 			
He drinks at least ten cups of coffee 			
 Yeah 			
But that is an antidote again 			
Yeah			
Coffee coffee and onion raw onion 			
 Onion 			
That is an anitidote na 			
You can try again because if the performance is 			
it can be cured 			
 Asthama can be cured in a sense asthama and			
But he is not ready to listen na 			
Uhm uhm that's why 			
He doesn't listen only			
But you can try again			
Very stubborn person laughter 			
We can try again 			
 What's wrong in trying again 			
I don't know they had referred to some doctor 			
But then he doesn't pay attention to all this na			
 all these things you don't drink coffee or eat raw onion			
etcetra			
Only these two things and what else he has to follow 			
Do you think you know what he thinks actually he doesn't			
believe in homeopathy cough there lies his problem			
People don't know about homeopathy			
Yeah that's why 			
 That's it na so I told him 			
ki Shireen's dad was also suffering from asthama 			
Even Shireen was even saying ki 			
her dad was suffering from asthama and cough uh one of her uncles is			
a homeopath 			
He was a allopath before but then afterwards he studied			
homeopath and now he is a pure homeopath 			
 Even 			
There are many people that way			
Yeah even Dr Shinde etcetra 			
So then uh like Shireen's father was cured by 			
his uncle na 			
 Yeah 			
Her uncle			
Her uncle			
Even my mummy			
Now he is not at all suffering from asthama you know not			
at all			
Yeah why don't you try to convince him 			
I I didn't try to convince him I tried to convince Laxshmi			
First of all you will have to convince Laxshmi			
Yeah			
Yeah we can even one or two words family there are			
 pe people			
You should have said ki what's the			
harm of trying just trying it 			
 There's no side effects of homeopathy 			
Anyway he's not going to get ano another disease			
He doesn't believe in that that small one word 			
 One or two words 			
Those are going to create a effect and that his asthama			
 which is almost I mean it's very chronic that is going			
to disappear 			
 We can take him to some doctor like 			
 who who are the renowned homeopath in Kolhapur			
 Shinde and all na 			
 Yeah 			
Maybe they will uh convince him			
Because that			
Because finally what are in his we don't have any uh I			
mean we don't want to earn and all that we just want to cure like that			
Yeah that's what the thing is 			
We can take him to a homeopath 			
We can ask the homeopath to make that interest in that person			
 because at this age if he if it is one word than a surgery 			
 uhm 			
I don't suppose he will uh get again the uh health and all the			
things back			
 Uhm 			
And now he is quite old no			
Yeah that's what			
Yeah			
At this age if is he going to have any surgery 			
 He's almost seventy over 			
Seven no sixty-five 			
Sixty-five			
Still but won't be able to reg regain all his health			
Yeah that is also true 			
Even my mummy is suffering was suffering from rheumatism			
 na she has taken			
Rheumatism is other horrible disease			
Yeah Rheumatism and we cured by allopathy			
No there are some diseases you know like which			
can be cured by homeopathy only			
 She had taken the treatment 			
Yeah only homoeopathy			
And the one is the is the uh rheumatism 			
 Rheumatism 			
Rheumatism			
Then skin diseases stones kidney stones you know I am			
telling you yeah only homeopathy can cure it 			
 Yeah 			
The stones can be passed to the urine only by homeopathic			
medicine			
But that is one problem the people don't believe in			
homeopathy still 			
But now-a-days many people are diverting to			
homeopathy 			
 But the even the allopth is preferred			
But that is only in the urban uh cities 			
Yeah precisely they are MBS actually MBBS no			
Yeah 			
Then 			
But giving a homeopathic treatment			
In the rural areas yeah			
These propoganda should be made na about			
homeopathy 			
 Let's see when we become doctors 			
 We'll try			
 We'll try our level best			
Actually right from now we should start the start I mean			
uh to			
Yeah creating			
I mean we should as soon as we learn one word we			
should start giving the medicine know 			
We should let other people know importance of homeopathy and			
how it cure up the disease 			
Even mental symptoms can be cured by homeopathy			
Yeah			
Yeah psycho psycho			
Yeah 			
 One word 			
Because each each persons constitution is different 			
Allopathy			
Allopathy what they do what they do you know			
 like know we all are suffering from a common disease say			
fever 			
They will give the same disease uh same medicine to everyone 			
 like 			
But homeopathy doesn't see that first he will know her			
constitution is weak your constitution is tough 			
So it depends na like for her I'll 			
give some else medicine the doctor will give you something else 			
 No you one word 			
 Yeah 			
I know that is a one word 			
When they give preference to physical over individual			
constitution as well as mental constitution 			
We can find even uh each and every constitution we see			
 the crowd also we can get many yeah definitely 			
 Yeah 			
And we can distinguish between them 			
I hope			
But the homeopath has to have that knowledge over			
the material			
Material and uh 			
Yeah			
If he is wrong somewhere whole practice is going to			
But actually homeopathy has no side effects na			
 so			
But still			
So when that one is going to ha happen			
and we have one or two word 			
 One or two words 			
But by reputation you can do it			
But he has to have his reputation 			
If the one word if he gets			
No yaar now even I a normal doctor 			
like even a MBBS doctor he takes five years yaar to			
settle himself in any town or a city 			
But he has to increase the power in that patient			
like today			
Today one word sir was not saying or what if you			
treat one patient he will go on telling all the all the people			
Yeah yeah			
And he will create a broad board of you that this is the			
doctor he will refer all the patient go to this doctor and all that 			
 that's there and then you become famous 			
 That's there 			
You may have the tact yaar 			
Really			
Tact is two words 			
I think Mane sir has that tact you know			
Yeah			
See he has got the 			
And Pratap Kulkarni 			
Pratap Kulkarni he is also very			
 He's an homeopath			
Then what 			
I didn't know that			
 A few words 			
Of course he was a student from			
No he was not			
No no 			
He was from our college 			
 He's a good homeopath 			
Yeah			
I didn't know yaar really 			
Even I one or two words 			
But how come			
He used to come			
I knew about Pratap Kulkarni but I didn't know that 			
he's a homeopath			
No I didn't knew 			
And he used to come na during the 			
time of our strike and all that 			
 Yeah 			
That was a very bad phase of our life 			
Horrible 			
Horrible 			
Strike laughter 			
I just want don't want to think about it			
I wish I would write a autobiography of myself about my			
medical education you know laughter uh ten year plan with two years			
of uh having a strike yeah and the remaining six years			
because I I was in the strike and a few words 			
Really it was a horrible scene			
 Yeah 			
And remaining because I didn't study laughter 			
I hope our colleague student don't come with us that			
class missed			
I swear 			
 One or two words 			
How could we face one word my god horrible			
What do you think he'll come or not			
 One or two words 			
I don't think 			
I think he'll come			
He personally is not interested or uh			
His parents are not interested			
He personally is not interested his parents are interested			
More probably his mother is interested in sending him			
Then what is the one or two words 			
Because she is not			
Instead of doing D A yeah D S M is more 			
better I think			
 Yeah 			
No actually he just wants a degree yaar 			
 he always one word hospital yeah 			
 That too a few words he is already a			
settled doctor he needs just needs a degree			
He knows all the practical appliances everything 			
Even			
Yeah			
How to give an injection to give I V this that			
Yeah he sits in in his father's hospital not			
a clinic			
 It's a hospital only			
Yeah I think			
Even she must be			
Well let him not come of course let him do D S M			
And he's going to waste all his certificates 			
Yeah he's not going to get back his certificates and			
money na 			
Thats right			
That is okay			
Instead of wasting thirty thousand and again fifty			
thousand in one word 			
Yeah now he'll have to give donation in D H M S			
College also			
 He's not going to get it just plainly like			
that			
 You know they are asking fifty thousand 			
 He's getting in free seat			
No			
No somebody told me			
What about Archana			
 She's taken her Archana she's			
 taken some short course computer and			
 Archana 			
One year course			
She can complete her this thing graduation			
No but uh about her L C and certificate 			
 That will also take take a long time 			
And I think she will take out duplicate 			
Duplicate from where			
Bombay			
Bombay			
We get			
Then how they got their mark list and leaving certificate			
in duplicate			
That is the main thing when you get a mark list you get a			
leaving certificate that's what I enquired you know 			
But again that caste certificate problem has arrived na			
She will do when she have when she will have to take a			
passport for this thing backward one word certificate			
 Certificates na 			
But if you need a for the passport you need one word 			
duplicate do 			
No I don't suppose but you need always orignals			
If she has a passport it's well and good otherwise great			
problem yaar 			
 Yeah 			
That she has I think			
Therfore she has to she will have to take help from her			
father-in-law 			
Yeah that way her father-in-law is quite 			
But it's better ki have an original			
I know now it's impossible

Of course I know him 			
He is interested			
Yeah 			
Uh let's see if I could talk to her about it			
Yeah that would be better you know 			
Yes 			
So 			
Just two of you you tell me what you want to talk about			
 laughter 			
 			
I 			
Can we talk something about the situation in these days 			
 			
Yeah 			
Actually you say something what do you think			
Like uhm actually why the real fighting is going on			
between Naga and Kuki I don't know the reason yet 			
You don't know ?			
Uhm 			
They are different uh people different people they			
have different reas uh versions about it			
Uhm 			
The way I know it is that uh now these Kukis are nomads			
Uhm 			
And they don't have a particular territorial area			
Uhm			
And what's happened is in in the Manipur area of			
 uh these Naga people the Tamkuls the Kuki people have come and			
settled 			
And now they they are in encroaching in the into the			
Naga areas 			
Uhm			
And so the Nagas are defend defending their place 			
 			
So we'll deal 			
No we've started 			
 Started 			
 			
You started uh 			
Yeah 			
So anyway you can just sit and uh laughter 			
 			
You can do this 			
So like I've just I don't know what			
happened between uh I mean in our place the situation right now so I am			
asking her to ex one word explain			
I was trying to explain atleast my idea of what I feel is			
going on 			
 That's one reason okay like uh this Kukis are			
encroaching on the Tamkul land so the Tamkuls are retaliating 			
That that is defending themselves 			
Then another one is that uhm this Anasian people were			
taking taxes from the Kukis 			
Oh 			
And now the Kukis they refused to uh pay any more 			
And so they are moving against them 			
Uhm 			
Like that 			
 			
For that only 			
Yeah mainly and that is how it all started because			
they said that we won't pay anymore			
 			
But this Tamkul no they are Naga 			
They are Nagas 			
 			
 That's what 			
Now what's happened is that the the Nagas before			
 there was no Nagaland 			
They said it's only in the last uh nineteen			
sixty-two or three that the Nagaland was formed 			
So each Naga group just lived in in their within each			
Naga group has got the particular territorial area and we live like that			
So like the Aungs we have our place the 			
Angami's have their place like that Tamkuls they have their place			
Uhm 			
And when statehood was given to us then uh they did			
not uh put all the places together but uh like much of the Naga			
tribes are now in Manipur there are some tribes in Arunachal Pradesh 			
some in Assam like that 			
And so now one of the demands of this uh the Nationalists			
groups that are coming up is that the greater Nagaland 			
Greater Nagaland means all this should be integrated			
Uhm 			
And when it happens then large a large chunk of uh 			
Manipur also will come to Nagaland			
Oh 			
And this was passed in the Assembly uh two months back 			
that Nagaland government also will try to do this and Manipur government has			
started noise so uh Tamkuls uh the Mar Mar 			
Marams announce like that			
 			
 Two words 			
Yeah they are Nagas in Manipur 			
This was like the fighting is going on in for a month			
Ha 			
They used to means people used to think that it's			
 happening in Nagaland because always Naga and Kuki Naga and Kuki			
Yeah that's true 			
Uh then			
Actually the fighting is going on in Imphal over			
Yeah			
 			
 It's not in in Nagaland 			
Nagaland it is 			
 It means between this Kuki and Nagas 			
yeah so far the clashes are going on means this killing and all			
are going on only in that place not			
 Yeah 			
In the hill areas of Manipur 			
 			
 In that respect Nagaland 			
It doesn't affect Nagaland much			
Yeah 			
 			
Ah ah so it affects only Manipur 			
 Right for example 			
When they say Naga means we think that some Angami 			
 Aau or some people of eastern parts or uh one word 			
 so far no one is in the one word only Tamkul 			
 Like two words 			
 That's why I was wondering why			
Uhm			
But 			
The after effect of course in Nagaland is where many of the			
Kukis in Nagaland are being uh quite a number have been actually killed			
Oh 			
So one Tamkul one shot one director			
Uhm 			
And then uh one Kuki I A S officer was also shot			
Uhm 			
And uh just before I came and after I came also two Kukis were			
shot like that 			
But it's a spill over from Manipur 			
 			
Kukis they stay in Nagaland itself 			
They are spread all over the place 			
 			
 All over it 			
So they are recognised as one of the tribes in uh Nagaland			
But they don't have a specific area in Nagaland			
Means they don't have a motherland 			
They don't have a particualr area like we do 			
So they are there in Manipur they are there in uh Mizoram 			
and uh in Nagaland and also in Assam half long area 			
laughter 			
Any more questions 			
So 			
 One word what do you want to talk about now 			
laughs 			
How is your further politics ? laughter 			
 			
I know nothing about politics I never bother to 			
Recording broken 			
Tibya now uh in the final year isn't this ?			
 			
Yeah 			
So what are you doing ?			
What are your subjects that you are doing ?			
 			
I am doing my civil 			
Uhm ha			
 			
Engineering 			
Most like it's mostly concerned about structures			
 			
Structures what structures ?			
 			
Like dams and all 			
Uhm 			
 			
Dams and canals and all those things 			
Uhm 			
So 			
So when you go back to uh Shillong do you think you'll			
 be able to apply your these ideas ?			
 			
Yeah actually my plan is to work in Public Health Engineering			
department 			
Uhm uhm 			
 			
Mostly concerned for dams and all 			
Uhm 			
 			
So and there is one branch in uh Mafna that's			
 about one hour from Shillong 			
Uhm uhm 			
 			
And that's a very good one 			
Uhm 			
 			
Maybe if possible I will try to work there			
Now they are constructing a new dam out there 			
Where in Mafna ?			
 			
Yeah Mafna 			
Uh ha 			
 			
 It's a beautiful place 			
Uh 			
 			
So that's my uh let's see that will			
work or no laughter 			
You think you will easily get a job there in that			
department ?			
 			
Not that difficult to get a job there 			
Uhm			
 			
P W D is very difficult uhm but not P H E ?			
 Uhm 			
Why ?			
 			
Because uh P W D most of the students no they 			
usually go for Traffic Engineering 			
Uhm so			
 			
But these days but that's not my aim I don't			
like Traffic Engineering I think I mean Highway Engineering 			
Uhm why is that many they just go for Traffic ?			
 			
 It's quite easy you know laughter 			
Because of that laughter 			
Yeah 			
 			
 That's it maybe I don't know why 			
Uhm 			
 			
But in P W D now it's fully packed 			
Uhm 			
 			
So it's very difficult to get a job 			
Uhm 			
 			
But P H E there is a chance 			
So thats what you are plannigg to do or any other things			
you are planning to do ?			
Now you are doing project no ?			
So what under what topic you are doing that project ?			
 			
Environmental impact on uh all the water resources project no			
How it affects the structures and all 			
How do environment affects structure 			
You have started working on laughter 			
 			
No yeah laughter

 Two words laughter 			
You told me this one a few words it's 			
about your one word studies laughter 			
I think she will have exhaust 			
Keri can tell us what she has been doing ? laughter 			
 			
Ha yes Keri can tell us laughter 			
Okay then after getting your job like what is what is			
your next plan ?			
 			
After getting my job ? 			
Yeah laughter 			
She will enjoy			
 			
No

How do you know that ? 			
Make out laughter 			
So you are so sure of getting job 			
 			
I am not so sure yaar 			
But you can try laughs 			
 			
But I don't mind if I don't get a job 			
 Laughter 			
 You'll two words more like that			
 			
Yeah 			
Okay then what about Keri ?			
I really don't have any idea about my job laughs			
 but as far as my subject is concerned I think I prefer working			
outside outside our place and			
Ah ha			
 			
Yeah but that's 			
Outside uh so what one word 			
 Now in our place there is no electronics			
department now			
Uhm			
So like I will try to pick up all those uh			
competitive exams no and all I will keep on trying laughter 			
Till you get one laughter 			
Till I have one job from outside laughter 			
So what are the different uh things that you are trying			
for right now ?			
Right now like I am not trying for any exam like			
Uhm uhm			
After finishing my this B E only I will prepare for			
those exams			
Uhm 			
So you have any idea what you are going to uh apply for ?			
See like I may write GATES also 			
Uhm uhm			
And I don't know whether G R E is there in Guwahati or			
not 			
Perhaps not sure			
 If it is there I will try the one word			
 or			
 			
 I think it is there 			
So you will try from Guwahati mainly ?			
Yeah means I don't want to come back here to just like uh			
 I will just get those materials and I'll prepare for more and I			
like Guwahati laughs 			
Yeah Guwahati atleast is quite close enough 			
But I am not sure whether it's Guwahati is the			
centre or not			
Uhm 			
I don't think yaar 			
 			
Calcutta 			
But GATES is there			
Uh 			
GATES is there 			
 			
Yeah GATES GATES is there 			
Both 			
 			
Uhm 			
But you better try G R E also 			
Means ?			
Uh like if I prepare for GATES it's only same G			
R E both are uh like the syllabus and all			
 			
In fact GATES is tougher than G R E 			
Yeah 			
 			
So 			
Oh GATES is tougher			
 			
Uhm 			
Then what about uh plans to go abroad TOEFL and all these			
 laughs 			
Hey which two words was doing			
Yeah it was not so 			
 			
But if you are writing GRE of course 			
 Yeah GRE also is same but uhm 			
mainly I think I'll prefer GATES only			
 Uhm 			
Uhm so you are not interested in going abroad ? 			
Laughter 			
Of course it's intrested but it's a bit 			
difficult for me laughter 			
 			
For me going abroad uh I think 			
 It's your dream			
 			
Going for enjoyment only not for studies laughter 			
Not for studies or a job uhn			
 			
Yes I think rose and all 			
 It's rose why why actually rose laughter			
 			
I must be a fan of one word 			
But of course if uh if I get a job in our place I prefer			
that one what I feel is that I don't think			
Uhm			
Because there is no department also 			
 			
But of course 			
 One word I will try in my place			
In Naga in Nagaland			
Yeah			
So will you take uh which one would you prefer uh 			
lower job in Nagaland or a higer paid job outside of Nagaland 			
Uhm it depends but suppose like uhn if the			
salary is at at around uh three thousand in Nagaland			
Uhm uhm			
And may be there is ten thousand in outside			
Uhm			
I will prefer the three thousand in Nagaland 			
 			
Yeah laughter 			
Yeah because 			
Yeah that's laughter 			
Uhm but as far as this status is concerned 			
uhm uhm of course high one also even though it's outside			
doesn't matter much laughter 			
 Uhm uhm 			
But first preference is on Nagaland uhn laughter 			
 			
Yeah that's right 			
Uhm 			
 			
As if you have laughter 			
I think economic so that I can always try laughter			
 			
You must always have hope na 			
Yeah they did it's not that we are going to be			
 one word just hoping and dreaming know laughter 			
Yeah nothing nothing wrong with that 			
What about the empty zones say the UPSC exams neither			
of you are interested			
 			
No 			
Not very much also but 			
 			
I am not interested in any exam laughter 			
Who knows who might get again we might change change our			
mind also to laughter 			
 			
Yeah may be after going home 			
After going home			
Yeah you might get inspired			
 			
But right now I don't have any plans 			
Uhm I knew you seem to be quite sure what you want to do			
both of you laughter 			
No this is just laughter Recording broken			
 laughter Okay uhm did you have a very unique			
kind of system isn't that among the Khasis where marriage is			
concerned			
 			
Uhm 			
So can you uh tell us something about uh how 			
what kind of uh what rituals or formalities that you observe and all			
this

No before uh uh how they get married laughter

laughter 			
 			
 Oh how to get married

After marriage I don't think you need to do laughter			
Excellent one laughter 			
 			
Uh actually we don't believe in uh arranged marriage and all			
those things

How was your journey Tina from Harihar			
Oh God I can't tell you it was terrible you know

they're having problem for conveyance 			
So they stopped all these buses			
All			
Only government buses uhn K S R T C buses 			
And then my God you can't they were throwing stones 			
And I was sitting in the bus near the window you can't believe it I			
was so terrified by this the one or two words down and then			
uh some fellow he came and he said don't worry if anything			
happens like that I'll take you home 			
And then the whole bus went back to this kum Kumarapatnam			
police station 			
And then they stopped over there and then I wanted to ring up daddy			
from there 			
But then I thought if I ring him up then again he'll take			
me back home and then I have to come back tomorrow another day I'll 			
be wasting 			
So what I did I just sat there for one hour and three hours			
there in that village you know in middle of nowhere and there's 			
nothing to eat also that was the worst part and I thought mostly they'll			
 reach home in the night 			
But nothing like a few words 			
 What time you reached 			
Uhm I reached home at eleven thirty or something			
Someone came to pick you up at the but stop			
No I came home in the rickshaw 			
And in Hubli my God so many guys got into the bus and

And then there was one fellow who was uh and there was this			
one fellow who was sitting next to me and then you know he was pushing			
the bag so that he could get closer to me laughter and then I pushed

All all the people

 In Hindi 			
 In Hindi 			
See the water how deep it has gone that's one or			
two words this is the regular scene when there are good rains			
 na water reaches right upto that corner 			
She also what is it			
I think both of you laughter 			
Pankaj in the north uh what kind of a system of study do			
you have 			
Do you have state level of studies 			
Yeah 			
Like in Maharashtra we've got uh yeah yeah			
 more important we all have three levels			
 Yeah yeah 			
Yes			
State CBSE and IPSC level			
 IPSC 			
Yes			
And which you find the best 			
I think uh easy board is state level one word 			
Why 			
Why 			
Yeah uh because the board			
Uhn 			
You you've been a CBSE and IPSC			
Ah			
Uh which is much competency you gain I think			
You mean it's very tough students can't			
follow it			
 It's very tough 			
No no students can follow 			
 It's very tough 			
Yeah it's tough			
Very tough for their age 			
 It's tough one or two words 			
 But don't you think that uh the students are			
uh trained in a better way by these two CBSE and IPSC systems 			
You have studied through			
Speak one by one			
You have studied through 			
State level 			
State level			
State yes level studies 			
 Yes 			
But uh I mean prefer the state level of studies			
Yeah 			
But now that have you taught in any IPSC school or a			
CBSE school 			
You said you were teaching right somewhere			
Yeah 			
Which school was that 			
No no it's not computer 			
No but you have taught na 			
 Taught in some school right			
Oh yeah 			
It is uh Mariam Convent School 			
 Mariam Convent School 			
Yeah			
Where is it 			
Uh it's near by my house 			
No I mean with Lucknow			
Yeah in Lucknow 			
 It's an English medium school 			
Yeah 			
English medium yeah and you taught 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah I taught			
Uh			
What did you teach there 			
What subject 			
Mostly if uh that science physical and			
mathematics			
 Physical 			
Uh that means you taught one subject yeah in			
which level 			
 Yeah 			
Uh right start from uh eighth standard			
Eighth to the tenth			
Yeah			
Did you taught these two subjects			
Yes			
And what uh state or IPSC or CBSE what level was it 			
School 			
No that school belonged to CBSE IPSC or state level school 			
I did CBSE 			
CBSE 			
Yeah			
And what subject were you teaching out of the science			
subjects 			
Not nothing 			
Ah you said this			
Out of science uh out of science and mathematics I			
teach nothing 			
But you said just now CBSE level under which which			
level did you like CBSE level or uh the state level 			
State level			
You like the state level yeah why not the CBSE			
 Yeah 			
Uh 			
Why not the CBSE level			
See whatever I want I can get in state level but in			
CBSE level there is limited course 			
Limited course			
Limited			
Yeah only a limit is there 			
No but in the CBSE or the IPSC uh the 			
curriculam of studies is higher than the state level always			
 No 			
 And the course also is uh wide enough			
 not limited			
Just think about it whole thing 			
Okay now uh Daisy what level have you studied in 			
State level			
State level that is the Maharashtra Board			
Then now you are teaching in a IPSC level but which do you			
prefer			
I prefer IPSC 			
IPSC level yeah why			
 Yeah 			
Because like whichever subject you study you get enough 			
study about that subject 			
Suppose after your you leave your tenth standard and you go			
outside somebody 			
You select some uh different side like science history uh			
 arts commerce 			
But in uh when you are in IPSC school you get enough knowledge			
about history enough knowledge about Geography 			
So even though you don't study after you leave the tenth			
standard leave these subject you know something about this			
Yeah you can			
When you study in SSC you get a very limited knowledge			
about that			
While in the IPSC history you can get more about the monuments 			
or more about whatever the caves or see you see 			
whatever history is about			
 You see 			
Uh I don't uh I don't agree with it			
We do you not know about your state level			
book our state level books are like see			
 No because because 			
Yeah I saw that uh			
Every state level			
Every state has their own sort of uh 			
 Yeah I saw that uh that uh in Maharashtra			
Uhn 			
Whatever be the admission level I don't know uhm			
 but I find that education level is low 			
 Uhm 			
Where 			
Here 			
 In Maharashtra 			
 In Maharashtra 			
In Maharashtra			
Then that is what we are saying 			
 That's what we both are saying trying			
to say			
So we prefer the IPSC more than the see 			
state level			
 See 			
You must one word 			
Here you can say that IPSC is uh better IPSC is better			
 yeah you can say 			
But uh there U P for state level in U P 			
 uhm compe 			
 Yeah 			
 U P 			
 Uhm 			
State level is higher			
Yeah state level is higher			
Yeah and we see these competitive examinations also that like			
the they have the students from the UP level are most shine out			
Shine out one word 			
May be it is because that uh syllabus is much better			
oriented as but uh when we Maharashtra students when we go outside we			
have a great difficulty in uh I mean scoring through these competitive			
exams 			
We always have to study little extra whereas you all you can			
get through straigh uh straight away 			
But uh what we have both of us I and Priya but still I found			
out that after studying the state level I can teach much better in			
the IPSC level because I find it is a much better system			
 It's a very uh well explained system for the students			
level			
Yeah			
Now in the Maharashtra system Maharashtra State Board 			
so what is happened is most of the Maharashtrians are rural background			
 uh students and the Education Board has tried to uh bring it			
down to the level of rural level 			
 A few words yeah			
And that way to put it in extremely simple language but I			
find that there is a total confusion in the way the subjects are explained			
out 			
There is no indepth knowledge given about any particular			
subject			
And			
Like if the person is from a higher background like 			
we find that that knowledge is not			
Too less to less for him			
For him to proceed for higher higher studies 			
So both of us Daisy and me have found out that this system is			
a much better systen as compared to our Maharashtra Board level			
Yeah Maharashtra			
But Pankaj you			
Yeah Maharashtra Board			
Pankaj you have uh some different views 			
Can you tell like any taking 			
Okay Daisy uh like uh about your subject chemistry 			
 uhm 			
Can you compare it with your uh I mean the state level what			
 you've studied and now you are teaching in the IPSC level 			
What way you found it different 			
 Uhm 			
Now let's see			
If it is chemistry and SSC level see like the state level			
You will have now say if you want to study some industrial			
procedure you'll not have the detail study 			
uhm see it'll just be an outline study uhm 			
Uh while in chemis uh in the IPSC type			
of you'll have the whole process 			
How much time it causes you 			
What are the reactions you what are the precautions to be			
taken			
You have more point IPSC in the IPSC type			
than in the SSC type 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 IPSC 			
 Yeah 			
Isn't than whatever you study say uh you're in			
the ninth standard yeah say you know more you have more			
knowledge in IPSC school than in the			
 Yeah 			
SSC school			
SSC school like they are one more uh behind			
The state level			
One step behind uh one step behind than the IPSC school			
Yes 			
Do you find that uh I mean uh they say the			
Maharashtra government says that the books have purposely been brought			
down to this level because the student then understand English 			
Now if you make the system so much easy for the students that they			
will in in a way that they are hampering their own uh knowledge as			
well as not getting down to the English knowledge 			
Don't you think it is so			
Yeah it is 			
That we don't even get enough knowledge			
Yeah of course that's what I've said no			
See if it is a student who is more brilliant he will find			
the study more boring and the 			
 How do you find the level of students 			
who come to the IPSC school			
IPSC schools are not that good you see 			
I mean uh they are also like all the other normal schools 			
But when they study that course they will prove more			
brilliant than those state level			
That is how 			
That is because they get more knowledge 			
Yeah right 			
Though they don't understand they'll make an effort			
because they have to study			
They have to study			
While those at uh state level students they are			
satisfied with whatever they get 			
And what they do is they only do the work of mostly by			
hearting 			
Right			
Uhn they don't uh like they don't want 			
to understand the topic 			
 Understand 			
Like if they are now the exams if you consider they			
have only the questions which are from behind the book			
Yeah right			
Well our IPSC schools have all through out the topic			
Yes they cover up the whole topic 			
 Cover up the whole topic 			
And understanding is expected in the school 			
 Yeah Understanding is expected			
Also the practical is very nicely like we			
start right from the eighth yes standard for the practical			
knowledge and all so that helps the students			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Yes 			
Yeah 			
And also it is seen that uh our students of the IPSC			
level when you go out to State Board junior college level			
Yeah			
They always shine out better			
 Shine out 			
Yeah and they get better percentage			
And uh they have uh a better application 			
 Whatever I saw that uh whatever I saw the			
education level here in English medilum no			
Yeah 			
The same education level is in uh UP Board in Hindi			
medium			
In Hindi			
So you're talking about			
Yeah in the state level 			
And there IPSC and CBSE is there for there 			
No you see this IPSC is equivalent to			
 your state level in study			
 You see 			
 Your state level 			
Not more state level but it is less it is less 			
but I find that children here that uh students			
 Ha 			
 Ha 			
These are like them like state level 			
 Accha are you saying your state			
level students are as equivalent to the IPSC IP 			
students here			
 Your state level students 			
 IP 			
No that uh yeah 			
Do you say that uh because you all are studying in the			
Hindi medium it is the better way the student can understand 			
 Can understand because if it is in your			
home language no they can grasp it more better 			
The Eng after all English is some			
 And even grasp 			
No why not in uh Maharashtra Maharashtra why			
not in the state level Maharashtra 			
 Some foreign language 			
No we don't study in Marathi			
In Marathi Marathi medium			
We don't study			
We won't be able to give you a better idea			
No no no 			
Why not some person have uh studied in uh Marathi also 			
Yes 			
Uhn			
Yes			
They also can teach in Marathi also			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
Uhm			
Yes 			
No what I'm saying is 			
See the matter that is given out to the students			
Uhm 			
Whether you are studying it in Marathi whether you are			
studying it in English is extremely less as compared to the IPSC			
level students 			
You know the course is more wider it's not			
limited in IPSC and CBSE			
And it is also observed that IPSC students or CBSE			
student shine much better in competitive exams 			
I and it is also observed that UP Board students 			
do shine in that exams			
 Do shine

No just a house-wife 			
 House-wife so that's it 			
Aunty you do craft 			
No not craft as such I do stitching work			
All these you did it			
No these things have been done my father-in-law			
Oh 			
He is a great artist 			
You don't know anything about craft aunty 			
Craft I don't know much 			
Because I wanted to learn something uh which you know 			
I know stitching I do uhm stitching of clothes 			
So if you are interested in that I can teach you			
Basic what's the basic in stitching aunty			
First what should we learn like anything 			
You should start from the smaller clothes 			
Uhm that's the easiest way 			
And the clothes in which uh there is not much of cutting 			
because cutting the things is uh very important 			
If you cut them nicely naturally the stitching will be nice			
The dress will come out nicely 			
So you should choose the clothes which are uh easy to cut			
So first you should choose the smaller one like dress of a			
baby which is easier 			
And then only you can graduate to uh complicated dresses 			
And I think that uh saree blouse is 			
most complicated thing 			
Oh laughter 			
And uh how do you pass time like only stitching aunty you don't			
have any other uh no passtime like			
 No 			
Household work is there stitching is there 			
 Hobby what's your hobby 			
Stitching and teaching laughter 			
I have heard that you have that stitching with the like 			
like electric current you use current for stitching yeah 			
how how is it 			
 Yeah 			
 There's a small motor 			
Uh it is attatched to the machine itself 			
And with the help of a belt that uh wheel of the machine			
the balance wheel of the machine that rotates with the help of that motor			
So whenever the current is there we can use this 			
But in Bangalore it's just 			
 You can take it out when there is no current			
and you can use it like that			
Yeah yeah yeah 			
 It's easy to take out 			
Just that belt has to be removed 			
And when that belt is removed you can just put on that uh other			
belt which is used for the paddle style running 			
Like for ordinary machine only you have attatched the mo			
 motor 			
Yes oh it's ordinary machine			
Earlier it I was using it on pedestal only 			
But uh after three four years I attached the motor to it			
So I can use it both way 			
There is no difficulty in using it 			
And whenever current is there it becomes very easy			
 Oh 			
Yeah because 			
Using it on the pedestal puts a lot of pressure on uh			
feet 			
Do you want to learn stitching 			
Yes but I am very interested but uh how			
Yeah at present you won't be able			
At present I won't be able but next year after my exams I			
think I want to learn stitching laughter so I was 			
And then craft uh 			
Yeah craft I was taught many things in school 			
But now we don't have yeah Sapna my younger sister she			
is interested and she does all things 			
But uh in T V I can't adjust with them and I can learn things			
from because			
I wanted uhm 			
No I want to do it with them like they are too fast 			
 oh I can't keep it everything in my 			
 Oh 			
 Yeah they keep everything half ready			
 yeah and then only they start showing it			
 Yeah 			
 And then 			
I want it uh actions like yeah face to			
face			
 Yeah 			
But then if atleast you can take down the things on paper and			
uhm then try doing them			
Yeah I can but I am used to teach like like I was			
taught in the school 			
Yeah doing the things of handcraft is really a nice			
thing you know you can pass time			
Time			
 You're doing something creative 			
Creativity is also important 			
Then what other things you want to do 			
 That's all not not much 			
But craft was my main and I liked it so much because in			
the school one word 			
Are you intersted in drawing also			
No laughter 			
Then who has put on this mehndi 			
This my younger sister yesterday			
Oh for the festival			
No simply we had 			
I was uh arranging my cupboard things and all and I found a			
packet of mehndi over there and so 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Its nice 			
Did she learn it somewhere or			
No just 			
On her own she's doing			
Yeah on her on own 			
Yesterday only the first time she 			
Yeah its a nice			
I was very scared to give it like to tell her to do			
because if it won't look nice if it if she does wrong 			
And then uh did you put it on in the evening 			
Yeah about at I seven-thirty eight 			
Uhm 			
And I removed it in the morning 			
 Haan that's why the colour has come			
out so nicely			
Yeah or else that was an old stock one can it			
was			
Usually the old stock doesn't give the proper colour			
Yeah 			
If you are interested in mehndi my 			
 yeah one of my friends mehndi class			
 yeah one of my friends is expert in putting on mehndi 			
 Yeah 			
 Mehndi class 			
Yeah I want to learn to put it to others 			
Yeah she is expert and she stays nearby only 			
So you can go and learn it from her			
Yeah I am interested to put but I don't like it			
putting myself sister wanted to try it on my hand and so she 			
Did she try it on her own hand also			
No 			
That friend of mine she can put on her own hand she			
can put by left hand also on her right hand			
Oh like uh no she can't do like that 			
And for putting on other people's hand she is			
expert 			
She is Rajasthani only			
Uhm yeah			
In Jaipur also she has got many prizes for that 			
So here we can call her uh master or something like that 			
laughter

Same thing happens to me also that's why I didn't

Anywhere uh			
Anywhere because we are now in whose who so that 			
tell me something more about that how you happened to go inside 			
Well it was a shock for me			
 Haan haan 			
Uhm actually I was not expecting anything 			
One fine day one letter came 			
You know Joshi this our uh this man yaar 			
 Diwakar's husband 			
Diwakar 			
He was in B E L no 			
Oh our Joshi okay I I got got him			
Okay you got him			
 Haan 			
 one word Joshi 			
He was that uh there at my house that day 			
I suddenly got that letter from one editor			
 Haan haan 			
And he told we have selected you for publishing uh			
 who's who in Asia and some so called 			
 But how how come he got your address then 			
Then I started looking at it			
It looked as if it had come through the alumini association of			
I A S C			
Uhm uhm 			
Because it was uh styled in the same way that is he passed			
 B E in so and so year from this college and M E also in this college and			
Uhm uhm			
Working in so and so Company 			
So his name also got included into that			
No he is not from I A S C 			
Then I checked up with two or three my friends who were in I A			
S C			
 Haan 			
Their names also had appeared 			
So this was actually whatever uh thought you you were			
proud of yourself that your name is in who's who but you don't			
feel all those bugger's names also laughter not included in			
that			
Not so but it the initially pressure was very high			
But now it is not so			
Whether it's it's not that uh something is			
of great achievement			
Many people who have done who had excelled in education also			
there who had not excelled in education but some other field also are there			
I see 			
Like that it is 			
It is some achievement who has done 			
Man of achievement in Asia or something like that they are probably			
No that's what I was surprised because laughter			
 I don't know what actually you had done 			
Well really you have to enlighten me on that 			
That uh okay you have spoken for me also laughter 			
Uh well uhm how have you told this thing to your boss then			
He don't know it's not worth because the			
bosses and other people in the factory			
Uhm			
They really are hell bent upon pulling you down 			
 Accha 			
In the sense now well I have been for one word			
 because to avoid those fellas but uh they are saying that we			
will not complete uhm myself and two words simply			
getting troubled			
 Uhm 			
Why why why they are not allowing you to give enough you			
are not allowed to do			
No			
Studies or things like that or collect some data 			
No the thing is atleast upto this January I need free time to			
study and uh prepare for my comprehensive exam			
Uhm uhm 			
And these buggers wants their own personal jobs to be done 			
which are most silliest in nature 			
And after getting some twenty years of experience uhm			
 you really feel that technical knowledge is instead of increasing			
getting reducing			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
You cannot go on enlightening them on technical things simply			
because you will be getting in trouble 			
I see 			
Now if you enlighten them they will come to know and			
tomorrow they will pull your leg			
Okay 			
But I didn't get personal jobs means which kind of jobs 			
Uh well some small things something to be done like			
 uh one small simple problem will be given to my immediate work			
Uhm uhm 			
 It's supposed to be done by that fellow			
Uhm uhm 			
He simply doesn't want to do it but want to show that he has			
done it 			
Uhm uhm			
So he will transfer it to me			
Uhm 			
Whereas there is some other related job to my PhD work my			
research work like some vibrations and other things			
If I want to go and attend it he says why you have to go 			
Let the requisition come from the department let the people call			
you with a uh kumkum tilaka and haldi kunku			
 and akshata then only you go how can I			
go 			
 Okay like that you have got now enough uh			
marathi words for saying this			
Yes laughter 			
Okay uhm no but uh 			
 Uhm 			
No it's happening recently very late uhm 			
within this in one month			
He only has suggested your name name for this			
No chance uhm no chance that fellow he			
won't do cannot suggest anything			
 Uhn 			
Okay 			
Now he himself feel that he should have got the chance to go			
for PhD or something like that something no no nothing			
like that			
 No no 			
He cannot go 			
 You know that 			
You know pucca sure that he cannot uh 			
Yeah he cannot go			
Yes okay so			
Now tell me something about yourself your achievement and			
 so on and so forth 			
Look it is the same thing as you 			
Uh only difference is that uh I've I've not			
also achieved anything 			
But uh lack of achievement uh uh doesn't mean that now			
 I'll who's who I'm still not there			
Maybe I'm trying to underachieve something may be 			
laughter hoping that some day my day also will come in a way			
Sure			
Right now the it's something uh doing lot			
of hard work and like that some project missions are there and uh 			
 with international company then see what what has happened 			
Working hard			
 I don't know 			
Specially today this software companies are having lot of			
 work actually			
Yeah 			
Recently I			
You see they are growing growing too fast that is that is			
idea so uh basically you are always under staff yeah 			
when you are working 			
And uh responsibilities are more and the things are going too			
fast so I think one of the major problem in software world over is			
that uh we one word basically we always underestimate the			
work 			
That is the problem known all over the world			
Always we underestimate our work by some three hundred percent			
 laughter okay so that is that is our true problem			
 Yeah 			
 Okay 			
And what about this uh what is called as uh sending			
programmers to USA as a cheap labourer			
Body surfing			
Yeah body surfing I've read that in computer			
magazine			
 Haan haan 			
September issue they have send it 			
That uh simply one fellow with a phone will hire some guys 			
 exactly and send there for one year			
 Exactly 			
Yeah 			
He will earn lot of money			
 That's true			
There are some three hundred four hundred person margins in that			
Uhn			
They tell you which uh this thing but the person who is			
going there that is also happy because normally once he goes he just			
quits that company and joins another company there			
But that uh H H one visa or something has			
change no			
B one visa is change to H one visa something			
 What has happen 			
Yeah but still still uh what has happened actually it is			
not exactly the cheap labour I will say that is also one portion like 			
uh cheap labour but the one another uh major aspect is that like think			
about a situation like uh would you like to go today as a well			
qualified person and go and work in Shimoga or some place called			
Shirshi would you like to work like that			
They will not serve			
You won't like 			
You like to work in indutrial base like Bombay Pune 			
Bangalore Delhi			
No no not definitely with the Bombay Calcutta			
Okay prefer anywhere uh place in let's say 			
 Bangalore Pune think like that place you won't like to go a			
small place			
 Bangalore or Pune 			
That is what exactly happens most of the jobs some of			
the jobs are in villages in US and people there don't want to go			
there 			
Okay but a person going from US uh going from India to USA he			
feels that okay America 			
America 			
So he is ready to live anywhere			
And and another thing one dollar equal to thirty-five			
 rupees 			
Yeah that is one of the thing			
So that is basically things which keeps you it's so			
and there also when you are in the small place there of saving			
potential is more and something			
But one one thing I			
Everybody is happy that that is the idea basically 			
The person who goes there will be happy 			
The person who sent him will be happy			
The company who has hired him happy 			
So everybody is so far so far it has been very well situatiion			
So it is a goody goody happy happy situation			
Yeah may be it may not be there after two three years when he			
was there then he feels that there are no chances of growth he cannot go			
to big companies			
Maybe when he realise when he has enough money then he will			
realise that that there are no much chance of growth later on 			
Then then he'll try to			
No but the thing is they want they they they try to move			
to better but they never come back to India 			
No some people are there some people have come			
back I know lot of people in our country uh in my company actually have			
come back 			
 Because that is 			
Uh ha which company 			
So total eight minutes are over we need to continue 			
na 			
Uhm			
We need to continue na 			
Yeah we must continue other ten minutes laughter 			
This exercise we have to be pulled on cough 			
Today what happened no uhm actually in the			
morning uh we didn't get our paper			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
So			
You bought it uh			
No no we ourself enquired why I couldn't get the paper			
So I went to that paperwalah uh 			
and that I ask I asked him what has happened			
What has happened since today next three days that			
paper-boy who drops the paper na he's on vacation			
 on leave uh and his manager or his uh that boss			
or whoever is the owner he doesn't know my house 			
So he knew that uh he can drop the paper but he don't know			
where to contact me or anything			
So I went there and now then he said okay do you want todays			
paper so he gave me			
 Uh 			
 Uh 			
So that means you got up in the morning and went there as you			
said 			
No laughter yeah yeah yeah 			
So just now it's ten O'clock at nine and we just			
now got up			
I see 			
We came came to you for breakfast 			
Breakfast okay 			
But unfortunately we have finished our dinner 			
So there is a jet leg between two of us laughter 			
By the way that I talked told you about Mahen Satkarsh you			
remember			
Yeah what has happened to him 			
Uh he one of his friend it seems had some vacancy for			
temporarily in the sense he said he can manage for few days and stay			
with him haan till he gets the place			
there 			
What has one word happened is			
 Haan 			
He has talked to one of uh persons from my company or no			
Uh I don't know I passed on the message			
Okay			
What happened was his company used to start at eight			
thirty in the morning			
Uhm uhm 			
He was under the impression it starts at nine			
 Haan 			
So one day he was going through the one word 			
casually and he saw the office time is at eight thirty to six or so			
Uhm 			
So he has to start approximately two hours early 			
Oh			
From here to majestic majestic to that golden			
enclove			
He has to start at six six thirty			
Uhn and that was not possible then what he decided			
was to stay with some friends there			
Uhm 			
And again that the body shopping is there 			
He has been told not to go in for a big house not to go in for			
a			
Yeah I know lot people are going any way			
Vehicle and passport and all those 			
Ha			
So he has to be on a temporary basis for sometime 			
Then go there work for one year uhm find out			
some job			
But I I doubt whether the visa will be given properly or			
not 			
 Uhm 			
What happens if the man going there and some working in			
some TATA TISL or something			
Uhm 			
Hi Chitra 			
Fine thank you 			
When did you come from Amrawati			
On sixth of November 			
How are you liking Kolhapur 			
Now I am adjusting to it 			
Why you didn't like it initially			
No 			
No 			
Why you don't like the uhm climate here 			
Climate is okay the people are not uh 			
People are very nice 			
Yeah 			
Climate is not nice because we are accustomed to the coastal			
climate 			
So we don't like this dry climate 			
I don't feel familiar at all 			
I like straight and perspiration then only I feel at home			
otherwise no laughter 			
But uh I like uh the climate here 			
 It's nice and cool 			
And uh though the people are slightly uh from the 			
Bhosle family or the Shahu family and			
They are royal people all are royal people 			
 One or two words 			
They talk and uh behave that way uhn 			
Yeah			
Courteous behaviour			
Having the arrogance of the aristocrat			
Aren't they soft spoken like the Nagpur people 			
no full of courtesy			
 No 			
In Nagpur uh Nagpur uh population is very much affected by			
 the non-marathi I think			
Yeah 			
That is why uhm their behaviour has slightly undergone			
some change			
Uh changed means that nazakat of Hindi			
language that's in your			
That way of speaking 			
And uh specially the business community is affected by Punjabis and			
Sindhis			
 Accha 			
So they are naturally more polite 			
But here the business community is dominated by either			
Brahmins or perhaps Marathas			
Local Kolhapuris			
Local Kolhapuri 			
So they are very arrogront in their uh one word 			
Only tone sort of arrogance but inwardly they are			
 very uhm			
No we have had bad uh			
Is it so			
Experience			
 Haan very bad experience 			
They are very I mean uh to make friends they take a lot of			
time I don't know why			
Yeah are they so choosy			
 Haan laughter 			
No even an ordinary uh rickshawallah or a			
shopkeeper			
 Accha 			
Will uh won't talk to you in a very polite manner			
like he is not bothered whether his product is sold or not 			
He is more bothered that if he like you want to			
bargain he says just keep it down and get lost laughter 			
 Tells you 			
And bargaining on our side is very normal sort of a			
thing yeah yeah these days			
 Yeah yeah 			
Every where in the cities bargaining will go on 			
So also our hostel uh staff who are working including			
the warden the bai 			
She breaks over very			
Sweeper everybody are horribly arrogant 			
They just want to do what is their alloted job 			
 According to the rule			
Alloted work that's all 			
Might be for years together they have been doing the same job			
fed up with this steoro type of that job earning from 			
But uh in our area people are ready to earn a extra			
buck 			
 Accha 			
Here even if you are ready to pay them they will not uh			
Maybe they have a lot of self-respecting personality			
Yeah and ego is 			
 Egoism is there at a very high rate 			
 And there is too much awareness yeah 			
Too much awareness about their working hours			
 Haan 			
Their right time is over okay no work 			
In uh Nagpur			
And one fine thing we found in Kolhapur is that people are			
I think so not too much addicted you see drinks or paan			
 or something of that sort			
Yeah these two things are common in my town			
 Because that is very less 			
In our side you see Vidarbha region			
 Paan do you say about paan 			
Ah yeah Vidarbha side we see less paan			
 shops here anywhere addicted and all drunkards and all			
 Yeah the spots of uh 			
That means many paan shops are there in			
 one word 			
You see in Amrawati you will find people lying you know 			
 drunk heavily drunked drunk lot and			
lots of people know specially those rickshaw puller I mean lower			
strata public			
 Is it so			
I had totally different ideas about Amravati 			
Yeah 			
I mean from the lower strata			
 Ekka we call that sort of rickshaw			
 Haan no cycle rickshaw 			
 Cycle rickshaw 			
Cycle rickshaw and all 			
So all of them are heavily drunk 			
 Cycle rickshaws are there 			
That population is the largest in working			
Even the auto people			
 One word cycle rickshaw			
Even the auto pe 			
Don't you think it's inhuman rather			
No no it's the cheapest form of transports still			
And the buses are very few			
Even these auto rickshaw wallah people are			
all drunk mostly 			
And they it's very terrifying			
Here that way it's quite safe			
Till you get down you don't have any guarantee 			
 Ah here it's very secure they are			
arrogant they are all you see 			
No safe driving you know			
No good mannered also or rather we can say character wise			
also having a very clean spotless character maybe that may be the			
influence of Tarabai			
And most of the rickshaw persons they are graduate			
 Haan 			
Just now I came know he was B Com person			
 Haan 			
So now-a-days they don't get job and instead of 			
hunting the job they prefer that			
 Maybe 			
That may be the reason one of the reasons			
These two things are really good in them alcoholism is			
less paan eating is less and honesty is there 			
 still there 			
 Compartively in our area paan 			
eating is uh 			
Still less 			
Yeah still less 			
Ha ha here I think that uh paan eating			
is more no no so that compared to your region			
 No no 			
No there are few paan and all they don't			
very less			
Very less I feel see otherwise Kolhapur and paan			
 closely associated			
There even our college students you know they take that			
 tambaku 			
Is it so oh			
 That's it			
So they are your gurus laughter 			
And here			
And smoking is also very great among the students there in			
Vidarbha region 			
And here we don't find the students smoking this smoking			
and all 			
 Now Americans and Westerners they know the			
evils of smoking as here they pick it up as a style you know			
Ha only statuatory warning is there but it's 			
a sign of manhood for them actually smoking 			
 But I think that that also gone for picking up			
on style nothing else			
Reduced now because it is this TV influence in every			
thing			
Yeah yeah yeah			
But here it is becoming lesser			
 That's what I feel			
And we know actually this no			
Ha			
But some people you know they read the statutory warning			
laugh and they start smoking			
Uhm start smoking and that's true			
Once you get into a habit nothing can stop you not			
even alcohol			
As your blood turns alcoholic and then you will get addict to			
cigarette smoking 			
Maybe to keep the company these students force na			
 the friends			
Yeah			
And in order to			
You can't oppose when you are in minority and they are in			
majority you can't oppose otherwise they'll laugh at me			
That is why uhn			
It happens sometimes			
That fear of public opinion compulsory to take			
Otherwise you feel rather afraid to stay down and shout of			
 one word in their company they will laugh at you			
It happens you know someone is uh rather behaving			
decently then other people they laugh at them and he feels very			
guilty about them yeah 			
 It's the style of one word if			
you see a gentleman like that way to smoke 			
And I'm really impressed with this University and			
its uh maintenance 			
 Maintenace 			
Yeah			
And especially 			
 Especially these you know library is			
very good 			
 These department people I like so much you know			
No our director is a very nice person I have never come			
across			
Yeah yeah yeah			
Such a nice person occupying such a high post			
 very friendly and we are not afraid also to 			
 Soft spoken gentle and 			
He is a scholarly person but he			
 Ha ha have a an informal			
talk with him			
 He's not a barrier between			
Ha no			
We are one word 			
Very great person and grand person			
And uh 			
Then he will he will be remaining in our memory for ever			
Yeah yeah it is true			
In Nagpur University 			
 One or two words in his place but			
still 			
He has nothing he is a very unassuming type			
of			
 Unassuming yeah really I wanted to use the same			
word and uh 			
Very few persons are like that 			
But in our University we can almost feel the 			
levels of corruption which you can't feel here			
 Feel that 			
Very high level			
Everywhere it is			
No here here you see there is less corrupt			
You can't bribe them you see			
It is there or it's not there we are not going to			
judge but			
Actually we don't see these			
No no we saw them bribing those ladies you know to sweep			
and all 			
They were not ready to sweep			
There is no it doesn't come in our duty 			
So it's not easy to bribe them 			
They have that self-decency or self-honesty as Shubha said			
 they have maintained it 			
Or may be that royal blood still frozen their vein			
In our University no one bothers to do anything			
Yeah			
You just give them anything 			
Now it more dominates on the class one 			
Ours is also worst it is 			
They won't accept and they won't move			
No but if there if you give any extra money anything			
can be done			
Anything can be done			
But here it is the other way round			
Even take marklist one word laughter at			
twelfth standarad level board Amarawati Board is			
Hazard of thinking			
Yeah 			
So we should thank 			
Dr Shastri and Professor Karande and now we should			
conclude for what he has 			
When when is you paper reading 			
When is your paper reading			
I don't know it was actually on twenty-sixth but			
uh Jahagirdar said put anywhere now			
 You got chances no 			
Any where			
Yeah			
So you have to be prepared anyday			
Yeah yeah I'am already prepared with my			
casette on 			
I am going to show it through the cassette 			
 Well how did you 			
How did you shoot the cassette like with who was the			
cameraman 			
Yeah Ganesh one word he is a professional and			
 he's my cameraman and he is a student of Shrikant Madhushri from			
J J School of Arts			
And he has got his own studio in Ratnagiri 			
And he is our friend so straightway we can say 			
Ganesh company and we can just drop it			
But how did you get this idea that uh you should make a			
video and			
Actually in the class you know I make free use of 			
cassettes for my kids 			
So we show them one 			
But this was for the first time otherwise that shooting			
job my husband used to do for me or Ganesh but uh sometimes I			
felt I should learn atleast samething of it			
I cannot handle the camera so video camera so confidently 			
but I am comparatively good at outdoors 			
Indoors and closeups I had to take help of my husband and Ganesh			
But then editing commentary writing dubbing then			
introducing the third scene of Santoor everything I have done only			
Ganesh was there he used to give me occasional instructions like that 			
And camera handling actually outdoor landscaping that			
landscape shot I have taken and actually the close ups and some parts			
of your architectural shots of that building Ganesh took my husband			
took and close ups of the faces my husband and Ganesh took			
But uh uhm like how did you uhm how do you use your			
video for uh teaching every day teaching			
Everyday teaching means not in the class 			
Not in the class			
In the class uh there is questions and answers session			
After the lecture			
Group discussion class uh			
Your which classes do you teach 			
Uh right from F Y B A to M A two			
What is F Y B A 			
 F Y is the first year			
 First year 			
Uhn			
B A to M A part one and M A part two 			
So after my working hours you know I am having about free periods			
Even my kids they have got free periods they come to me sometimes			
 I'll take them to we have got such sound proof AC			
room 			
 It's actually computer room we have got ten computers 			
but is just like a hall remaining part is unoccupied you know and there			
are chairs semicircular monitor is there			
So straight away we can take facility of that room and our			
principal cabin it has got one set T V set monitor uh video is there			
 and even that is sound proof and AC 			
So only five or six students are there			
Sometime they come in group for explanation and asking			
their doubts and difficulties			
So I can take them to the principal's cabin that			
way he's very generous 			
 I'm Mrs Chapala Nayak from Orissa and 			
what's your name please 			
I am Mr Mishra from Arunachal Pradesh 			
I have come here for a refresher course uh means in Kolhapur			
How do you enjoy it ?			
I enjoy it very well but uh I thought there could			
be more uh uhm programmes like guest lecturers many more guest lecturers			
coming from outside 			
That could have been a better programme 			
Look suppose uh we are forgetting about this refresher			
course how do you enjoy this place ?			
This place is also is very nice			
Very nice so I think that's uh			
Here the weather conditions are fine and yeah			
 very pleasant 			
 Yeah 			
In Arunachal Pradesh the conditions are totally different 			
I work in Bondila 			
And yesterday there was in the means T V means that uh 			
there is heavy snowfall 			
The temperature is always uh minus uh seven uh seven to 			
seven degrees 			
I take also this place for enjoyable			
But uh I get a little bit of cold because I have some			
sort of problem here that typical cold here uh over above all its			
 okay 			
That is why			
Climate is so nice I think and the beautiful			
sceneries are here			
 You're right 			
And when will we go back ?			
Actually on fourth uh this refresher course is coming to			
 an end 			
And after that I plan to go back via Orissa to 			
Arunachal Pradesh			
Tickets it's uh have you reserved ?			
I have got my reservations 			
 No not got 			
Then we may go both of us			
Now that is how your husband also by that time we meet he			
has requested me 			
I have uh told him that I will acompany			
Have you visited any other place ?			
In ?			
In Kolhapur ?			
Yeah I went to Mahalaxmi temple 			
I went to also Rankala lake I also Shalini Palace			
 			
 That Kolhapur city 			
Why not we are making a programme that uh for Panhala I			
think it's a nice place 			
 Panhala we'll go uh we've 			
planned it uh on next Sunday 			
If you like you can join us 			
I think it's a historical place 			
Yes since I heard that there are forts and uh some			
other things let us see yeah 			
 Shivaji 			
It it is mostly in the pattern of our Barwati study one			
word Barwati Durg 			
Yeah 			
And that day in Panhala we will be able to find our			
own uh past culture 			
Culture of Orissa tradition of Orissa 			
How do you find is it better than Orissa ?			
Actually means uh every place is a good place 			
We cannot say which place is better but uh to each one like his			
own name sounds the sweetest the place uh where he is born			
that must be the best			
 Then how is it that 			
How is it that that from AP the natural scenery ?			
Natural scenery also see in AP that is quite good 			
because that uh the government is taking much interest in developing that			
into a tourist 			
Is it hilly hilly area ?			
Yes hilly resort 			
They are going to develop it in the Sima Simla and Kashmir			
type of			
Then how do you feel that uh remaining far away from you			
home ?			
Obviously if you remain far away from your			
home uh you will feel nostalgic for your home			
 Next time you'll 			
 Then also family 			
And very often even if I like this place but uh I feel			
very homesick here 			
 One or two words was got to feel that but anyway 			
the the call of the business is there and you have to there be there			
for 			
You are remembering your children family 			
Certainly laughter 			
And I also feel			
Very often when I feel that to go and that to visit some places			
here I always remember my children 			
That it means they will be with us how nice it could it be			
 That could be better 			
I also feel			
And here actually I feel that uh they are not giving us			
any holidays 			
And just like Makarsankranti which was uh Shiv			
ceremony idea			
Like in 			
 one word we are going to forget it			
 In Orissa 			
Yeah 			
Because there is no holiday 			
I also thought that day we'll be getting some 			
makar chawal and some other things means this all			
cultural and traditional things 			
 But they're observing here in a different way			
 			
Yeah means uh uh also I am looking food in a mess			
 That some sweet they're giving 			
Yeah 			
And saying that 			
 In the class also they gave certain sweets			
That gudgudate like this			
Ha right 			
That is quite good also 			
 This is almost seem the Simla pattern of Orissan			
 This that's why I seem 			
Only the variation of culture actually 			
 That's what different culture 			
Ha it is there			
The way we observe it's different here 			
And again that uh Saraswati pooja we observe there			
with uh so much pomp and ceremony 			
 Haan 			
But here they are one word they don't know what which			
Sarswati pooja 			
But Ganesh pooja is different here			
And in Maharashtra Ganesha is a very uhm a good uh big God			
 a uhm you may be finding on the street you may be watching on			
the T V 			
 It may be but they're not observing			
that Saraswati pooja and I feel that's 			
it 			
 Ha but uh every region has got it's own			
Gods and Goddesses yeah and that is 			
 Yeah 			
No not that uh it's your own God or Goddesses 			
laughter Gods and Goddesses are there everywhere 			
 Natural 			
But uh they by culture generally you have got			
your own specific ident tified God			
 They 			
Yeah 			
That happens and uh Vinayak is a very important God here			
in Maharashtra			
Uh you come Orissa when in your vacations every year			
 ?			
Almost every year because uh every year we are having two			
vacations 			
Two one actually vacation of two months summer			
vacation			
Summer 			
And in winter we get about twenty-two days break we			
call it the winter break			
Do you come in both the vacations ?			
Almost 			
You enjoy that 			
Certainly			
Summer summer 			
Summer actually in Orissa these days it is			
becoming very hot for us after staying there in Arunachal for about 			
uh say seven eighty uh seven years uh years I am finding it uh			
very hot to manage in Orissa particularly during summer 			
 Summer 			
 What's your idea about that Konark temple ?			
Konark temple			
Do you find any other substitute or something equal 			
in any other state ?			
I think so far as Konark temple is concerned Konark is			
Konark 			
Uh it has got a world status uh you know it is there in			
 uh the great surprises of the world 			
It has been enlist enlisted that way			
And so in some of the states you may be finding very good			
temples like here in Maharashtra Jejuri is there on our way 			
from Poona to Kolhapur from the train I had a glimpse of Jejuri			
Is it so artistic ?			
Jejuri ?			
It may be I have not uh seen it			
I have seen it only from the train I think it could be			
because uh like Jayanta Mahapatra has written on Konark uh here Arun			
Kolatkar has written on 			
That temple			
Jejuri 			
But the difference between Jayant Mahapatra and Arun uhm you			
can find as the people say the critics say that Jejuri is uh on			
the pattern of T S Eliot's Waste Land 			
It might have been but			
Might have been actually we've we've not			
read it so you cannot say but Konark after all it is on a			
different pattern			
Yeah I think so that uh it's completely			
different 			
 Haan 			
Mainly because of uh not of that uh background on			
the one side that the background or the story behind it 			
We take it as that of the patriotism that about the			
 It is the case of patriotism			
It is a case of sacrifice			
It is a case of uh a fa father's love for			
his child a son's dedication for his father all			
that 			
 No not only 			
Also you say if you go back to that 			
Dharamputli Jheel 			
 And it's artistic 			
Ha that artistic talk I think 			
Artistic talk is there certainly and uh if we go			
back to that Dharamputli Jheel yeah you find			
 it's all a count in search of his father 			
And the father and the son then they don't get an opportunity mean			
to exchange the mutual courtesies 			
 Yeah 			
The very eve evening the boy reaches 			
The same night he constructs that uh dome completes that dome			
Yeah yeah completes			
And again for the sake of his own uh uh community he			
sacrificies jumps from the river			
But it shows			
As jumps from the top of the temple and uh gets uh			
buried in the 			
It shows his patriotism put itself I			
think 			
 Put itself 			
Its patriotism			
But the boy is that what to be expected more than a boy			
like uh Dharma of twelve years or ten to twelve years old 			
Right of course it's a it it			
can be different uh a differently interpreted it can be also a sign			
of patriotism I think			
 It 			
Have you seen that Chandipur ?			
Yes Chandipur I have gone Chandipur where we			
have got this uh ordnance factory 			
 Chandipur 			
Yeah and that Gopalpur ?			
Gopalpur in Barampur ?			
Uhm 			
That sea beach nice			
Sea beach in the a few words 			
 Haan one word central uh of			
course the light house is a is a bit away from that 			
Gopalpuri is also			
No not I			
Connected to our Orissa's rich past 			
From there only we sailed in the long past to Japan Borneo 			
some other places we hear			
Then what's your idea about Chandvali ?			
 One word the government is taking a lot of			
interest and uh it has developed into uhm missile and 			
missile the present site uh			
Yeah 			
But let's see			
It also			
There was a huge approach previously 			
That there was a port 			
There was a port but uh			
Again they are trying that uh that to have built 			
 but if it will be possible 			
 But 			
It may not be possible now			
It may not be			
In in this present condition of the 			
They are trying that			
Yes they may be able to do may not be able to do 			
But in the left of one word and this uh ordnance			
factory there 			
Do you enjoy your service there ?			
In Arunachal Pradesh			
Yeah 			
Enjoying it			
How how many are there from Orissa ?			
Means actually in our college there are three 			
From Orissa ?			
Yeah 			
 I'm one then another is Mr Nayak he's			
 a lecturer in History and there is another Dr Mahonty 			
he's from one word but he is from Orissa 			
Orissa 			
He is in Political Science 			
 Orissa 			
Why they are so much interested and also you ?			
No it's not a case of interest			
Then ?			
 It's uh			
You got the chance how ?			
You get a chance and you go because in these days of uh			
 unemployment and all that you cannot just stay back at home			
 and take risk 			
 That's what 			
No to me I I always think that uh the first chance is the			
best chance 			
Whenever we get no no first the chance			
 No no 			
And also 			
 We've to abide after that we may consider			
That is the prescription 			
Because if you leave a chance those same chance may not come			
to you again			
And so far as coming to Orissa is concerned 			
 And which is your in one word 			
we've to do grasp it 			
Once the matter if coming with Orissa is concerned you			
can come back yeah anytime you like because the UGC has			
uh as per the UGC scheme uh you can come to the university in a way			
That way I'm looking up for a better future 			
 Yeah 			
That you are thinking that to come back Orissa ?			
Yeah in if anytime it is possible I'll come			
back 			
And here in Orissa the correspondence are quiet good also			
As far east organisation has come under uh actually after UGC 			
recommendations have been implemented with new year we are finding the			
pay scales are almost the same 			
I was previously working in Kandapur college 			
I started my career as a lecturer in Kandapur college itself 			
in Orissa 			
But in uh new the conditions in those uh days but in the			
private colleges			
 That's obvious problem is everywhere 			
Actually I joined that uh in nineteen eighty when the			
college started 			
And now still now I'm there 			
Uh I heard that day also actually I I matriculated in			
seventy-nine 			
Seventy-nine			
Seventy-nine and you joined in eighty			
Eighty 			
That is quite nice and interesting also 			
And we have four there no 			
We have lot respect uh better command 			
And others 			
In other departments 			
Yeah			
No they have 			
Off day that is a uh			
Two to three members are there 			
One wo working that the result 			
Means the government has got yeah different			
categories 			
 Yeah 			
Not that according to plus two and plus three system 			
In class two they have minimised just like the clerk and			
something like 			
Actually in other states the pattern is different			
They are not having the junior colleges 			
They are having the plus two plus plus system of Indian school			
 we call it as one word 			
 In Orissa they have not done till date			
But in Orissa even the a few words 			
But they have done the bifur bifurcation in one			
college plus two plus three all these systems are different			
But the pay structure is quite good for them for junior			
college lecturers because you find they hire secondary teacher a			
senior teacher who gets uh sixteen uh sixteen forty to twenty-nine			
 scale 			
Whereas in Orissa you get uh means a junior college			
lecturer gets uh two thousand to three thousand five hundred 			
I think uh that is the second pay 			
No that is not the second that is higher than			
the second stage 			
No now in Orissa 			
So they are getting two thousand uh they are getting it			
at par with the O S officers 			
That means class two 			
Yeah class two 			
Whereas we are also class one officers 			
Not actually class one			
Yes class one 			
There 			
No we are 			
No no 			
There			
A P 			
Uhn 			
 Haan 			
Hi 			
So what are we talking about 			
 We're talking about uh Alma how do			
you pronounce your name 			
 Elma 			
Yeah my name is not pronounced Alma			
It is Elma 			
Alma 			
Elma 			
What is it the Malyali Malyalam way of			
pronouncing 			
 No it is an English name			
It is 			
It is and uh the name is so it means loving it			
means nourishing it means fostering it means cough 			
How come most of this Keralites have name English names			
especially			
Something like Shirley and Elma and no Mary			
and all that			
 No 			
Mary is not uh English name you see			
Yeah it is I think so 			
Surely English name it's in the one			
word 			
 It's it's very ordinary name we make			
 One word 			
It is something I heard for the first time Mary 			
Mary			
Yeah I mean it sounds more Christian not exactly			
Yeah I always used to			
Not enjoy only some chose the Christian			
I always get confused with these names			
When I hear these names I think they are Anglo-Indian names			
Some Christian name or something yeah then I have			
to one word you are not an Anglo-Indian			
 Yeah laughter 			
Yeah 			
Then what			
What did you do in college today			
It was boring

And if we feel to their heart			
Yeah so he likes you laughter 			
Oh yeah 			
Oh but then when you introduced to our friend no that			
basic manners 			
 But may be he has of manners 			
No maybe he's afraid so many girls are			
Then he should not come 			
So what do you think about the disaster happened 			
 Dakshin Maharashtra about earthquake 			
Actually Umesh as we have seen there are a lot of			
people died 			
Ahn 			
So uh according to scientists they are expecting one more			
But this is very very serious disaster happened last month			
Uhm but do you think that what has happened is for			
good or bad 			
No no it is extremely bad 			
In the last around ten fifteen years this is the worst uh			
disaster happened 			
In India or on earth 			
Uhm			
In India or in the world 			
Uh I can't tell in the world because I don't know more			
about other sides happened but in India this is the very very			
serious hit to the people and also to the country 			
Uhm 			
As as this is a very serious happened Mr P V			
Narasimha Rao should have take taken a very 			
serious step on this			
Oh yeah 			
And that affected a lot of people and also many houses			
every thing has been crushed 			
Do you think anything that will be going to happen in 			
India 			
Yeah Umesh just for the day			
Have changed in India earthquake my friend			
 Yeah 			
Yes Umesh 			
Actually what happened is scientists have predicted that 			
there will be a serious earthquake in one uh again 			
In uh most probably in December as they have predicted 			
Because uh before that time they have to take more			
precautions as there is a lot of life lost in the 			
earthquake till now a serious step has to be taken 			
So we have to think about it a lot 			
What do you think about those people whose lives have			
gone whose lives have gone in earthquake 			
Yeah there are uhm there are lot of relief funds			
coming from outside the country and people are also donating on this			
 break in recording 			
There are a lot of uh relief funds coming from other countries 			
like uh donations of amount and aid and also the food 			
one word like uh food uh from other countries and also from			
 the people are also donating break in recording 			
But don't you think that it will be better that if uh the			
people take up general opinion of say uhm helping us 			
Yeah we like to have it so taking to uh what is			
called uh box or something and uh going on just asking for			
relief this one uh for earthquake relief fund for earthquake do you think			
it is better Mr Mahesh 			
Yeah 			
Uhm yeah I think people are donating and also the 			
a lot of participants are coming to take part in the relief fund			
So as far as my thinking people are donating as much as			
possible for the relief fund as they think that their own pople are			
dying from whole everything 			
So we also should have to take part in that 			
As far as my			
But Mr Mahesh see what I think is uh that people being			
suffered by this uh being wounded in all this cases 			
it'll be better if those people uh would would			
 have lost their lives because see all the things what has			
happened it all most more uh it's been happened slum			
areas you can say always you get			
Yeah 			
So and you can have and one more thing is uh			
not only in India but also as uh and most of the countries are concerned			
 all this uh what is called uh the unwanted scenes happen only in			
slums like uh you know this uh raped and uh they all this multi-			
millionaires trying to become more and more millionaire 			
yeah by destroying all the slums			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
So what I think is it'll be better if all those			
people would have lost their lives in uh the earthquake			
Yeah so what do you think which is more beneficial			
 to participate in the earthquake 			
Because as far as participation is concerned uh it would			
be better first uh those people who are uh half the way			
Uhm			
In their life that is uh half the thing they are 			
living and the other half side they are dying in that case it'll 			
be better people gener donate generously			
Uhm 			
 That's what I think 			
And more one more thing is if people would have lost			
their lives the population also would have gone down			
Uhm 			
So from that point of view the other people also 			
would have been uh benefitted because the earthquake doesn't bring 			
the problem of uh			
Uhm 			
Eatables			
Uhm 			
Then uh any other miscellening uh purpose			
Uhm 			
That wouldn't be much of problems 			
And what do you think of the PM's participation			
in this relief fund uh relief Umesh 			
As far as PM's is concerned the prime minister uhm			
 he's working quite hard 			
Of course uh I think even he is generating I mean he is			
donating generously 			
But to some extent 			
We can't say that he isn't uh uh helping them 			
 It's his duty to those because he is the prime			
minister of the country no 			
So now what do you think about the earthquake in			
Maharashtra 			
There a around thirty thousand people have died and what do you			
 feel which is better			
No as I told you before that uh it'll be 			
 the thing was better if all the people would have lost their lives in			
that as I told you before			
Uhm uhm			
Because one more thing is now this medical expenses			
 and going for that thing as far as living uh even the medical			
expenses have been given free the all items			
Uhm 			
But as far as uh other thing is concerned			
Uhm			
They being lost their property and other thing 			
uhm they naturally feel uh bad about they feel that the life			
is miserable			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
 It's better if they would have lost their lives			
Now what do you think about the people maximum many of			
the people have died in Maharashtra			
Oh yeah			
So what do think about them 			
About them sa sad 			
What would be better if what would be the better steps to			
be taken 			
I think it was good what have what happened was good 			
And what about what do you think about the uh			
earthquake happened in Gulbarga that is in Karnataka 			
Yeah in Karnataka that same opinion			
No many people they uh very few died and also			
No the same thing that has been applicable to Maharashtra			
Uhm 			
So okay uh now we'll shift on to some other this			
one uh recording broken 			
Okay Umesh what do you think about the Dussera 			
festival that is uh from next week they uh the college has			
declared holiday 			
So what do you think about it 			
Enjoyable one word 			
Okay Umesh uh actually what I am thinking is I am thinking			
to of going to Mysore and uh spending there a week seeing			
the Dussera festival that is uh in front of Mysore			
Palace 			
There will be a big crowd and also the Mysore 			
Maharaja the uh Maharaja will be seated			
on an elephant and uh all uh			
I a few words some Maharaja at present 			
No actually his grandsons are there			
So they are going to uh get him seated uh on an elephant			
in the place of their fore-fathers 			
So there will be all ministers and also the Prime Minister will			
be attending the uh function 			
So I think there is a grand festival and people from all over			
the country will be coming 			
Okay Umesh what do you think about the compt competitive			
exams conducted by the All India level 			
 It's good for students to come up in life			
Uhm 			
So they got plenty of comp competitive exams			
Uhm 			
So it helps uh students come up in life			
Uhm 			
In just not in monopolying uhm they have			
got plenty of other way			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
So it really helps 			
 It's something like an entrance something you say			
Yeah like uh many most of the intelligent persons			
will be filterd and will be placed in a top most position 			
And uh so it helps a lot of students who want to be in a			
good position 			
And so what do you think about their this one future or uh			
like will it be good or uh will there be any politics or what do			
you think about it 			
No as far as their will power and their mind is			
concerned if they are well strong enough 			
Uhm 			
 They'll be well placed 			
No what I am thinking if there is some 			
political background like uh from some minister any influence			
comes and uh will they change their mind or will the correct person			
will be placed on position			
 They'll have good or uh 			
Hey that's what I'm telling no 			
As far as the will power and the mind is strong uhm			
 they need not have to uh keep uh say they need not have to			
keep themselves down 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah okay 			
Now what do you think about the State Competitive Exams 			
State competitive exams right people are uh 			
taking much of interest in Union State competitive exams			
Uhm 			
Know what I think is in the national level many of them			
who have done well will not be qualified			
Fine 			
Sometimes in the state level they may be qualified 			
Their intelligence may be understood or their intelligence			
can be seen by the examiners or some higher persons who are going			
to conduct the exams 			
So I think uh this this is more uh it's good			
competitive exams all India and state level it is quite good 			
It helps people in many ways and also influences many of the			
 people to come up and also be placed in a good position 			
Well what do you think about the university exams			
conducted 			
So university exams are conducted uh see at present			
India is considerable you know plenty of universities union level			
Uhm uhm 			
And some of the some of the universities			
Uhm 			
Their great wisdom			
Uhm 			
So what I think is doing in that particular university			
Uhm 			
The persons career to some extent might be spoilt			
Uhm 			
Because moreover now-a-days when we go away 			
for job opportunities			
Uhm 			
What they ask is 			
Uhm			
Preferably from a good recognised university			
Uhm 			
And if the university has got a black spot			
Uhm 			
Naturally all the persons who has studied in that 			
particular university			
Uhm 			
Also the same thing			
Will be a waste			
Yeah 			
To the student who has studied over there			
Exactly 			
And what do you think about the college itself 			
If the college is not good how can a university be uh means			
 uh be pointed out 			
The college is not good in the sense what do you mean 			
Like uh lecturers are not good or students may not			
be good or sometimes the placement may not be good 			
As far as lecturers are concerned			
Uhm 			
The teaching you know might be quite low 			
uhm quite high the level standard			
 Uhm 			
Uhm,			
As far as students are concerned 			
Uhm 			
The main thing all depends on students			
Uhm 			
They they have got a good friendship			
Uhm			
Alright 			
Uhm 			
They can uh deal with any other thing also that's			
 with studies			
Uhm 			
With lecturers they can have good relation also			
 			
But suppose if the students uhm don't have to			
build up their good friendship			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
Good friend circle 			
Uhm 			
Naturally the college also gets a bad name			
Uhm 			
So in which the achievers also will also be included			
Uhm 			
Okay then 			
Okay Mah okay Umesh uh we have talked a good 			
We had a good conversation			
Yeah and uh I think the flood relief might			
take a good turn and in the earthquake may take a good turn and 			
it may be of some help to the people 			
And so I'm thinking of finishing this			
discussion by this topic itself			
So okay Umesh say you good bye 			
 Good bye Mahesh 			
Good bye

So I am going to see still I have to take books and I			
don't know whether my mummy will allow or not because			
Books and all means uh now you have not taken already 			
I have taken but uh say some one word 			
Refer back			
That kind all they have been changed			
Libraries are there 			
Okay Ganga 			
Okay Ganga today I tell you uhn about the 			
uh terrorism in Kashmir 			
You know uhm when we left Kashmir no uhm 			
somewhere around in ninety ninety yeah ninety March 			
Uh we have to face such a difficult time I can't tell you			
We left that uh place in the night time two O'clock			
 because the terrorism was so much means like it was so so			
much uhm widespread you couldn't yeah we couldn't stay			
there 			
Like uhm those terrorists uh they wanted us to uhm uhm			
to accompany them in the revolt against India			
They want freedom so they told us that you also accompany us			
 and we'll fight against India			
We want freedom we'll have a separate state 			
But as it is Hindus are in minority there in Kashmir uhm 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhm 			
 You couldn't 			
Muslim is more 			
Yeah Muslims are more in number 			
Hindus are in minority so Hindus said no we will not uh 			
fight because India is our country we don't want freedom 			
So we won't accompany you in the job 			
 That's why those uhm Muslims they got very angry 			
They said no you have to accompany us accompany us			
If if you if you want to live in this place you have to			
accompany us 			
We said okay fine uh some people uh accompanied them and			
some people didn't 			
And those who didn't we were one among them 			
We just left the place in the night time because of people were			
trying to poison the water and then they were trying to put off the			
electricity in the whole one word in the whole city 			
And then again they were uhm trying to trouble us by invading			
our houses and trying to misbehave with our women and all 			
So it the turn took like that we left the city in the middle of			
the night and we got scared			
We didn't even take things along with us just the clothes we			
were wearing 			
We went in those clothes only uhn 			
So later on when we came uhn to uh to Jammu we migrated			
from Kashmir to Jammu 			
Then uh then there we couldn't adjust with climate and all 			
in Jammu 			
It was very difficult because Kashmir is basically a very cold			
place and uh Jammu is a very hot place 			
The temperature is uh ranges from uh thirty to say forty or so			
 forty-five 			
Many Kashmiris died also in Jammu because of hot weather 			
Jammu 			
Yeah uhm then uhm 			
Then what happened 			
Yeah something about Kashmir I'll tell you because			
Kashmiri in Kashmir Muslims are also suffering a lot 			
They are not earning that much they are supposed to earn 			
Uhn 			
Uhm I tell you like uhm uh in our Kashmir no in			
 summer months we used to have some uh somewhere around uhm 			
I don't know it was the income was too much it used to be somewhere			
around in crores when it comes on state level 			
Now it is nothing because the tourism is nil 			
Those people are suffering 			
 Nobody can go 			
Nobody can go to Kashmir now because they don't want any			
tourists also 			
 They're kidnapping tourists 			
 That's why the tourists			
What they will do this this kidnappers to tourist 			
They might kill them or they might uh try to ask them			
uh like to do something or they might tell government to leave their			
terrorist in uh return 			
Like we leave this tourist only if you return that uh 			
terrorist which you've uh arrested 			
Means any terrorist the government would be arresting no the			
police will be arresting 			
Those terrorists they have to leave 			
If uh 			
But there some tourist is there or no in Kashmir 			
There are no tourists			
Now the tourism is at nil 			
There are so many hill stations and uh beautiful lakes and			
forest and everything but all in vain now 			
Only the export will be there because the fruits there are lot			
of apples and peaches and plums and pears 			
Those all they'll export now means sent out of the			
Kashmir 			
They won't keep it there because that is the only they have			
income for them 			
Those people are also suffering a lot			
So many people have died 			
They were supposed to be a big big very big field there uhn			
You think it'll improve now 			
I don't think it will improve because those people already			
many have died no 			
So they want that let some more also die but we'll take			
the freedom once for all 			
But I think India also won't let it go because uhm if India			
 let's it go means it has to let go also Punjab also then 			
It has to let go uhm then this naxalite uh problem also			
there			
They also then then also they have to give uhm this another			
state for them people for those people also 			
Uhm			
I mean so so I think uh this problem will never			
end and uh sufferers are we people 			
We have left all our property there worth lakhs			
 of rupees 			
And all it is very difficult and especially for business people			
 they have just scrambled businesses all flop there nobody can uh			
rely upon business there 			
Anytime it the shop may be burnt down or any time in cross			
fire your life is also not secured there 			
You may you go out of the house in the morning you do 			
you never know that you will come back in the evening because the			
condition is like that 			
In the evening time you are not allowed to keep the electricity on			
They think that uhm those uh security people think that you			
are doing any conspiracy inside 			
So for that also you have to take care you you don't have			
any freedom literally there because even now security forces are trying to			
 get the situation in normal 			
But that requires a lot of strictness and that strictness			
seems to be adopted to the people there 			
Even they are getting against security people now 			
Life is nothing 			
Life is nothing that is not the question			
Life is something but you have to struggle to achieve something 			
Life is a dream 			
 That's all 			
Nothing 			
I think 			
Missing my mummy 			
Missing my papa missing my everyone			
What to do 			
It really yaar feeling so bored I mean in

 Uhm 			
In the first phase we have only three subjects 			
 That's nothing we don't we are not in touch with			
any of the patients 			
Uhm 			
We don't come in contact with any of them 			
All we learn about is anatomy physiology and bio-chemistry			
These are for the first phase 			
 These like other background for our 			
future studies 			
They have to commence 			
 Uh 			
They are preparing us before coming in contact with			
patient 			
This is the first phase 			
This is the first phase then in the second phase we			
have some clinical subjects in which we come in direct contact with the			
patients ah but it's on two basis like when we see			
the patients at the same time we study about the pathology only 			
 ahm ahm the pathology and then we learn about some of the 			
drugs which are to be which are used for their treatment 			
 Ahm ahm 			
And the last phase 			
And the last phase we are in total contact with the			
patients clinical completely clinical operated we'll 			
be examining them diagonising them 			
So it's more like a practical 			
 It's more practical and then after we pass it			
 we have another years of year of internship 			
That is a complete practice as such when you finish the			
final final year 			
But they don't give you a degree until you one			
word 			
 Finish the internship 			
So where are you going to be for your

With a fishing rod 			
You use a fishing rod not a net 			
Uh 			
Not a net 			
Uh not a net 			
Net means going into the water 			
Going into the water means getting wet

So the specimen of the one word have to be kept			
We will have to tell them what's wrong what case is			
there in one word or whatever and why there is one word 			
 indications through the one word 			
Then on the other table there will be uh instruments like			
 one word all those instruments 			
And then they will ask you the indications a few words 			
On the third table they will just have the a viva 			
They will ask they will be asking general questions about the

 Two words actually we get it on completion like			
you call as a completion this a piece of paper with all the			
departments written on it and as soon as you finish your posting in that			
department you have to take the head of Department signature in front of

Ah do you know something about uh use of statistics in			
Psychology 			
No way 			
What are these			
No in P G they use this 			
No I haven't done my P G I have done my graduation			
 I'll introduce myself two words			
 my name is Girish Hullur and I have done my B Sc forestry 			
So how many two words your studies 			
Families 			
Uhm			
You should have learnt about uh forty fifty families 			
 one word exclusively uh			
 One word 			
Forty fifty 			
Yeah 			
In one year means			
No it usually our one word tries to see			
You study entirely botony 			
Yeah entire botony			
Even this ecology and all 			
Ecology then uh Physiology Entomology all 			
Entomology so two words 			
Hey come on yar I am getting you are			
getting out of the track okay I'm 			
Okay okay okay 			
Okay			
So which topic			
So why why not talk something about the social and all 			
 problems or something like that 			
 You should have listed some something			
socially relevant and most in thing 			
Eh do you think uh the funds that they are collecting			
for the earthquake is real worth of 			
When we have a feeling that nobody is using I mean like 			
the population is not as much you know it's one word 			
only there and we are colleting more than uh double funds only			
No they are creating a sort of reserve fund			
 It's not fund and in one month two			
words 			
 One word 			
It is said that the politicians are only eating it up 			
No it directly goes to charity associations you nee			
nee need not be afraid of uh the funds being used			
appropriatly 			
 Not afraid I mean as a citzen I think I should			
know about it 			
Uhn you've to di directly send it to			
government okay government will supply the funds to non-government			
organisation			
When the people are not existing only what you are doing with			
the money			
What kind of people are not existing			
There are people there are a few words 			
 There are so many people uh the poor people 			
But the funds that we are collecting			
Not for the			
There are many villages			
But the funds that we are collecting I don't think so			
Not for the people that they are existing now uhm			
 but it's for people who have been crippled and who have been			
disabled and who are suffering 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
 It's not for those who are uh fit and they are uh			
Then 			
Then what 			
Then what 			
So how do you feel of this programme 			
What programme 			
M B A 			
Programme M B A			
I think uh M B A should be strictly made for uh			
Commerce students and Engineering students 			
No way no way you cannot offer management in			
every field so			
 Why 			
There are 			
No management only I don't think so it's easy for			
the Arts students 			
Atleast they should have some programmes for the 			
 Nei you have some programmes arts			
 nei you have some programmes			
 Arts 			
Of course one word problems nothing like that			
 It's not problems I mean like we are not used to 			
we are not taught about uh accountancy statistics 			
Many higher students have this problem			
I mean you people are hard working and usually			
we have seen that Arts students are very lazy I mean like merry go			
round type			
 And the one word students yeah 			
 Uhn very lazy 			
Lazy sort of people they are not used to obstacles			
 that's one word 			
 They are lazy people and in the school time 			
one word know that sort of 			
I think they should have some training for the M B A beginners			
 especially to the Arts students			
Oh you mean to have foundation course for 			
 They should conduct separate classes 			
Atleast somehing no the basic foundation should be			
little bit strong			
 They'll find that they need a foundation course 			
 to Arts and the science students 			
 What do you need it 			
I think you'll have one word 			
No means regularly I mean you know even my doctor says			
 I'm regularly irregular 			
You better enroll for M B A this thing evening			
programmes that would be better for you 			
Now I am			
Not this problem are like one word 			
 One word actually I'm 			
definitely not interested in business			
I have something more interested in Psychology 			
Psychology doing B A psychiatrist and work for the people especially the			
mentally retarded the abnormal 			
 Psychology 			
And why did you opt for M B A 			
Means it was just for the heck of it I appeared for it			
 and I got caught 			
Yeah just for one word you need to mould your			
 career and you know why 			
 I don't think so 			
I think it is pure luck			
Obviously you don't want to enter into any kind of programme			
that you			
No			
It was actually after my graduation it was of course M B A			
was the first entrance exam that was out so you know 			
 A few words 			
So because of success just squeeze in it 			
I don't know I think			
Just tried your luck 			
Pure luck 			
 It's two words 			
I know that it's pure luck laughs 			
So 			
And I regret entering it			
Maybe I'll be very happy doing it later on 			
I mean you are planning to do 			
Many people give an excuse of a sort 			
 Continue 			
 It's not excuse it's a reason but 			
I'm not giving it up you know I'm standing by 			
Just offering it 			
No I'm going to do it you know the first time			
was we are one word 			
 One word sort of			
I didn't know how to prepare first semester and all now I			
know how to			
Yeah now you know you have missed so many one word			
 in past 			
I know that's one thing I'll never be			
 able to compensate 			
So how do you feel uh aids is research going on			
now how do you 			
 I'm out of it I've no idea about it 			
Come on you should be aware of it 			
I mean			
Everybody should be aware of it 			
Of course aware of it but I'm I mean I don't			
know much about it 			
Hey what would you be after te ten years from			
now 			
Ten years from now I visualise myself as a more of a			
practical man rather than in terms of success and failure which			
is part of one word 			
 Hey in which field you are going to be in			
See any sort of thing I'll have no 			
boundaries to having suitable say any kind of 			
 Suitable 			
What a plan 			
What do you mean plan you don't have to plan you know 			
everybody dreams yar 			
I don't dream 			
If you don't dream you can never 			
 Hey it'll be lot of question 			
 It's not that only when you dream you think of			
doing something 			
You can use 			
But that is impractical 			
Not practical you every man has to dream it it's			
 practically proved 			
Dream is something different than 			
Dream in the sense not sit and day dream just you have a			
feeling in you 			
Someone one word 			
So how do you visualise yourself 			
Myself somewhere in the public field 			
Maybe helping out with my dad 			
 Then you're political figure			
Yes somewhere with my dad 			
 Like your dad 			
Particularly politics or writing novels and uh full			
fledged poet 			
Painter that's it 			
You are interested in politics 			
Yeah I have two words my dad he is sitting 			
sticking to this post 			
So how do feel the corruption towards what kind of a 			
I think you can do no mean yeah politician you can be			
a perfect politician only if you are crooked 			
No way no there're so many people who are not			
crooked and all 			
You just can't know you have to be crooked 			
 Your dad know much you have 			
Because politics is itself is a crooked field you know 			
you have to be very crooked in it			
But you have certain 			
You you know if you are straight you are pulled down man 			
you are just pulled down 			
But you've have some leaders where whereas 			
you'll have a certain affiliation towards sometime you feel that uh			
You do it you know means			
Always they are not corrupted 			
Some people will be			
I don't uh mean like I don't like politicians			
I like politics 			
 That's running in your blood you know 			
After sometime you will become one politician 			
I don't mind I mean only I'll be an			
actress in one word I'm not a good a politician 			
I can't be because I'm not crooked yet			
Maybe one fine day when I'm put in the post 			
 One usual kind of 			
Maybe you'll 			
I will as well solve lots of things have makes a good			
politician			
 It's not like accept things which is uh which			
you have one word 			
Look that is what I dream and I don't that is what 			
I'm telling it out 			
So you need a challenge always not guarding your 			
 perspective 			
 Something I mean like I have my own set of			
principle my own way of thinking			
Oh 			
Everyone is now 			
Because I don't compromise with it yes I listen to			
you yes yes but I do whatever I want to do 			
Compromise means we should compromise at times 			
Look if it is affecting somebody else fine I'll 			
compromise 			
No you should compromise with yourself			
No that's my life yeah one word 			
it's my life why one word force in my business			
Live and let live that's my policy 			
 No way 			
So others may be a few words then what 			
you'll do 			
Well they are elders yeah I I I can't do anything			
if it's my mother or my father 			
So you			
But I'll try to convince them no I do it			
 behind them no problem 			
 So you 			
So how do you react to your friends 			
Friends			
When they suggest something to your own way it			
might means compromise			
 Look yeah 			
When it's my friends we share a very different			
kind of relationship like 			
We are very frank everybody knows who how and what she			
is going to do 			
Like they can literally predict your every move 			
Frankness doesn't always mean 			
 I'm telling you listen I'm 			
 telling you know I'm not telling you frankness means			
frankness means although they're telling what sort of friendship			
 I'll share with my friends 			
And everybody knows and most of my friends are my childhood			
friends			
They know what I am 			
I mean they know I won't listen to anybody 			
But still as a good friend they always give me the advice			
And if I find it worth and if I can feel that I can take			
it I do it			
 Accept whatever 			
You always tend to make certain adjustments in friendship 			
always			
Like if it if if never imposed no okay if			
it is together you are doing something yes I'll co-operate			
Whereas I alone have to do it no I don't take anybody's			
 advice 			
Of course I ask people but the more you ask people the more			
advice that people giving it's more complicating for you to decide			
it 			
 If it is 			
So let's switch on to new topics it's 			
already boring deciding a single particularly one word 			
I think Sumati should be speaking yeah 			
 She should speak on educational standards now			
 What yeah 			
What man 			
Sumati is more like a one word 			
very good listener and usually you know good listeners they won't like			
they don't know anything of themselves 			
 Two words 			
 Keep quiet 			
 laughs 			
 It's true			
 That's specially true about Capricorns so you			
 one word 			
 Oh so you are Capricorn			
He must one word 			
Definitely definitely I'm a Capricorn 			
Oh come on don't play tricks on 			
But you know what they say on Leos because of that			
 Leos two words the world the world is stable because of the Leo			
 One word 			
No			
Why			
 I'm not bosting okay because I'm a Leo			
 I'm not bosting 			
I am S Nambirajan native Kalyanam district in Tamil			
Nadu Tamil Nadu state 			
My name is P Swamy I am from Coimbatore coastal			
district in Tamil Nadu 			
Well sir good morning how are you 			
I am fine okay			
How are you sir 			
I am also very fine 			
Uh did you go to the university 			
Ah yes I went on uh twelfth uh June ninety-four			
Uhm why			
A speech to make			
What was the speech did you enjoy 			
Ah I did enjoy uhm actually sir 			
Are you getting any letters from home 			
Ah yes I got			
What are these			
I got three letters from home uh one from the family and			
one and other two from friends			
Ah yes from friend Mr Arun 			
Ah yes he described me in his letter uhm 			
why he couldn't come to this uh refresher programme			
 Uhm 			
Yes he seem you don't call single that isn't it			
Ah yes you see he is a good company			
Yes he is good 			
Then uh what about our local political scene there do you know			
anything 			
I fear uh I don't know 			
We are here for more than uh three weeks			
Uhm 			
So I'm not in a good position uhn to			
 speak about the local politics of Tamil Nadu			
 Uhn 			
But I received a letter from my friend yesterday			
Ahn 			
He has told that there is ahn a hue and cry			
over the reservation issue			
 Ahn 			
Ahn about what			
For the entrance examination uh for uh admission in the			
professional group in Tamil Nadu			
Ah ha 			
Now we have reduced the reservation from 			
sixty-nine percent to fifty percent			
 Ahn 			
Above 			
So all the political parties are opposing it and uh 			
Uhm 			
Uh agitating with uh in a vigorous way 			
 oh ho 			
So each and every party is uh having a bandh 			
 everyday 			
 Oh ho 			
And you know the petition of student is 			
ahn taking a serious turn half or so			
 Ahn 			
Are schools and colleges running there just now 			
Actually they are running			
Ahn 			
Uh but now and then they closed because every			
political party try to have a bandh on a particular			
day			
Ahn 			
And the leader of the main opposition party Dr Karunanidhi			
has also been arrested 			
Ahn ahn 			
And I don't know what about what happened to him afterward			
whether they released him or not 			
But something is wrong with the state of affairs in our			
state 			
What do you think sir about this election reservation in			
Karnataka 			
I think they should not have introduced it all of a sudden			
They should have introduced it gradually 			
Ahn 			
Say sometimes it may affect the people 			
Ahn 			
Who who are aiming at something 			
So they should have announced it earlier or 			
they should have uh introduced the scheme in a gradual manner 			
So that nobody will be affected 			
 Ahn 			
Ah uhm 			
So you say that there should be a psychological preparation for			
the people to accept this election			
Yes yes certainly 			
People are not prepared to accept it all of a sudden 			
Because this people never expected that they would announce it			
at this junction even when they call for investigation they did			
not mention it clearly mention about anything 			
After receiving all applications and fixing the date for			
examination and all			
Ahn 			
And they come out with this announcement people will certainly			
get scrabbled that is uh I think they wonder ahn			
 would be criticised for it 			
 Ahn 			
Moreover the political parties are uh aiming at			
Ahn 			
Uh utilising response into in their favour			
 yes			
 For 			
For their coming up			
Role 			
So there is no wonder there will be some concessions 			
Will it be useful for common persons 			
If so uh upto what extent 			
I don't think uh it will not benefit much but anyhow 			
 uhm some uh bright people have uh some chance to come up			
But at the cost cost at the cost of uh the			
downtrodden people 			
 Uhm 			
Will it be harmful if uh shall we say uh from			
different uh as you say it is downtrodden people			
Yes certainly it will affect some genuine cases 			
If it is genuine cases we may accept it as common one			
Yes 			
But uh will it effect the nation as a whole 			
No I don't think it will affect the nation			
But uh ahn on the whole the people 			
 ah uh to some extent ahn may be affected 			
I think so 			
 Ahn 			
 Ah 			
 Ahn 			
Well uh in my opinion I think that this reservation			
 uh quota 			
Uhn 			
Uhm should have uhm should be applied			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Only for this non skilled job 			
No 			
Then ahn once again the criteria of casteism will			
come into scene you see 			
 Ahn 			
Uhm			
The people who are employed in uh very luc 			
lucarious job ahn they will become another upper class			
And these people who are employed in skill work they will			
become the lower class because ah uh the			
casteism the origin of casteism was on that basis in the beginning			
So once again we are going to that line 			
So what I say is the people a particular community people who			
were uh who were supressed ahn for generations			
together and there is no harm in giving them some chances to come up and			
uh this must be the main issue 			
 Ahn 			
 Ah 			
 Ahn 			
Uh I do accept it			
Uhn 			
Uh whereas skill is the only factor uhm			
 uh which can make a nation uhm progress 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
But we have we have to do some sacrifice 			
I accept all those things because the efficiency uh			
intelligence everything is uhn a plus point 			
But even then			
 Uhn 			
Uhn 			
We have to do something for the ahn 			
upliftment of these people 			
And more important the people from upper caste should come			
forward for that 			
 Ahn 			
Uhm 			
Then only there will be 			
But you see 			
If we do that there will be social harmony there			
will be a good understanding among the people 			
But now a days it seems that it's working in the			
opposite direction that percentage people when they have to get			
some important post they don't think that it is for the benefit of the			
society and they they think that its for their own benefit and all			
 their personal gains 			
You see sir some people say you know that is in			
railways ahn and the post office sir			
 Ahn 			
Yes 			
Uh that additions of uh the personnel in			
those department yes have considerably gone down 			
 yes only because of this uh reservation			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
Yeah true 			
Unskilled people			
Uhm they say it is baseless 			
The unskilled people uh come to the top uh they ar			
not in a position to cope uhm uh with the 			
necessity uhm uhm uh towards high post or high rank			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm 			
Uh so they say they say uh that standard of service			
 uhm has gone down			
 Uhm 			
Instead of say uh that is the only resaon for the 			
uh down coming of the services there are so many factors but to think			
 to some extent it may be true true 			
Because those people have not yet been given a chance to 			
act in that capacity 			
There are so many factors like that 			
But outright we cannot say that all those people who come			
under the uhm reservations are not being or inefficient			
There are so many people they can they could uh shine like			
anything 			
Here in our case there are two such persons that belonging			
to schedule caste			
 Uhm 			
Uhn			
But both people were very efficient and they were uh 			
upright they were honest they were intelligent and they were up to the			
mark 			
They their services were highly useful to the department			
concerned			
Yeah yeah			
And those people when they left their post they left			
with a good name good integrity everything 			
So we cannot say that it is the main factor			
Some people may say like that because you see railways and uh			
postals were once upon a time dominated by a particular community 			
Nobody will have entered that job L I C railways 			
post office and banks 			
Because I have got my own experience even though I came			
 with a very good uh marks in the ten plus I was subject in 			
English 			
Though in both one word and three or four banks L			
I C in the oil field ahn I requested them even though I			
belong to a forward community I still didn't got get			
 			
Even though I belonged to a forward community I was oppressed			
there because I do not belong I was not belonging to a particular			
community that's the 			
So I find that these people should be given some time now			
but there should be a time limit 			
And there should be some other issue 			
Creamy layer should be avoided 			
They should break brought to the they should be brought to the			
 for a period like that 			
This scheme was well I think 			
And actually downtrodden people must be given some importance			
That that's where we come uh we must also			
 Ahn 			
Ah yeah 			
Uh I accept uh your point it helps us 			
That means uhm as a poor nation 			
uhm should strive forward and should thrust for the skill 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Skill is very very important I don't I don't deny it 			
Uh only by using that skill that bring sense uh			
we can make our nation strong also 			
Yes I accept it			
See as one thinker say India is a rich country but			
with poor people 			
But was it uh			
Our natural resources must be exploited for which			
 uh both uh intellectual skill and uh manual skill are			
required 			
 You see 			
Yes yes it is true but our uh constitution makers			
 they introduce all these things in the hope of some good deed			
But you see our people are misusing it to some extent 			
Because take this minority issue also minority 			
like minority issue			
 What what 			
 Haan 			
They were given protection in order to have a good			
chance to come up here			
Uhm			
I mean in all aspect but most of the people are looking			
for this originality moreover there is uh many people are misusing from			
here self benefit 			
And the people from those minority community are affected much			
Only by that route constitution is affected 			
For example educational institution are started by minority			
community people but the teachers working there are not success like			
anything they are remained as it is they are not given uh their			
salaries they are not able to protest it that uh any treatment or			
anything like that 			
So the intention is good but the implementation is			
something wrong 			
So we must find some way of otherwise we cannot say that			
the system is itself is fully wrong 			
Thats my opinion 			
 It's a nice opinion indeed 			
Needs of the best one word but direction is one			
Thats what is important I accept it 			
Because when uh when we go through this uh experiences			
 first hand informations we feel that our people are wherever			
they go wherever they belong to which state they belong to which religion			
they belong 			
Most of the people think that everything should be placed for			
their own purpose as to a draw that line 			
Because it is the guidence of the politician			
Yes certainly they are men			
Yes they are now 			
Now politics has become a profession once upon a time it			
was a service to the people 			
But now people think that it is also a kind of profession 			
So all the people will say please others and make this			
 their way 			
 Right it's become a no capital one			
word 			
Yes certainly 			
The capital which only the rowdys and goonda have			
 that's all what else 			
Okay sir it's a pleasure uh thank you			
To chat with me 			
What 			
Thank you thank you 			
Thank you 			
You mean baba laughs

Okay uh 			
She went to Bijapur

After that she hasn't bothered to write a letter to her			
Lata made a mistake who asked her to buy a saree

It was Shrinath's idea			
Yeah			
He forced her to buy a saree

Meant for caring caring and or uh 			
 Caring and 			
Uh leading a man to love uhm and all this

 hairstyle and uhm the white evening gown yeah 			
with gloves Ô uhm the gesture she was making when she was

Indian history from writers perspective 			
Come come 			
Uh uh well Anjali you have been uh teaching French here			
 uh what courses are you taking right now ?			
Uh I am taking uh C O P course uhm 			
that's in the morning and I'm also taking the advanced diploma			
courses in the evening			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm what about M A do you teach M A also ?			
Yeah I teach uh literature at uh the M A level			
Literature you teach			
Yeah 			
What literature do you teach ?			
Uh well mainly classical literature and uh it starts			
from the sixteen century to the the middle ages uhm to			
the nine ninteenth century 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
Uh I mean we do that over a span of two years the			
second year and the third year			
Uhm so your basic specialisation is actually literature			
Literature yeah 			
French literature			
Yeah French literature that is I did literature for			
the M A but uh I for my M Phil actually I changed I changed my			
topic a little			
I I did uh teaching of French uhm uhm then I			
have come back to I've gone back to literature			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm Uhm 			
Uh what authors do you normally read ?			
Are you working on some particular author or ?			
Oh not at the moment 			
I am not working on my Ph D at the moment though I have hoped to			
 uhm very soon 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
But uh 			
Who are the authors you are reading ?			
Well uh uh ma reading or uh teaching ?			
Teaching also			
Teaching well we start from the middle ages 			
So we start with Harbeley and uh uhm we go			
on to uh the eighteenth century Voltaire Rousseau uhm			
uhm uhm then ninteenth century we have all the Romantic poets 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh the realist Flau Bert			
Uhm uhm 			
Madame Bowary oh this this uh well known			
author			
 Oh 			
Uhm uh alright coming to your evening courses in the			
certificate of proficiency course uh what is the text book you are			
following ?			
Uh we have this book called uh 			
Alizee-acutes de francais 			
 Alizee-acutes de francais			
 			
Yeah it's a it's a it's a a			
very recent uh book 			
Uhm uhm they stated all the new methods 			
 Taken in all the new methods and did well 			
but uh uhm it is a good book			
 Uhm 			
Good book			
Good book yeah 			
Is it one book for the entire certificate			
 No it's the three 			
 It's no it's uh yeah entire certificate			
is one book 			
I mean we have three uh three volumes 			
The first one second one third one 			
So those we use for the certificate uh the diploma and the advanced			
 diploma 			
 Oh you have 			
 Advanced diploma			
So we don't always uh finish the entire book itself			
 It's a little too much			
Uhm			
So we say about the three fourth of the the book we do			
with the C O P uhm then we continue with the diploma			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Three fourth of the second book and then we continue with the			
third book uh the second and the third book uh for the advanced			
diploma			
Uhm			
Of course we supplement it with our own materials 			
Uhm uhm 			
What is the book uh you follow for uh Russian ?			
Uh you see we have several text books available but uh I			
normally use uh a book called Russki yuzik dlya vsekh			
 that means you know Russian for everybody			
 			
 It's called Russian for everybody 			
 It's a whole set of books actually it has one text			
book			
Uhm 			
And there is one latest stock so a lot of conversation 			
jokes anecdotes they are all there 			
Then a book of exercises 			
These excercises they normally do at home			
Uhm 			
Then we also have a book called you know 			
Reader 			
Uhm 			
Uh KNiga dlya chtee- acuteniya			
 this is a book there are some stories etcetera			
there			
Uhm 			
They read it like non-detailed text			
Yeah 			
Plus there is a small dictionary which gives all the			
words which are used in the text book and all these books 			
Plus there is one small reference grammar 			
Now this grammar uh explains all the grammar used in you			
know lesson-wise again			
Yeah 			
So that way it's a nice compact one 			
Yeah actually our courses has a casette which goes with it			
Uhm 			
It it has uh uh book meant for the teacher guide for			
the teacher			
Uhm 			
And uh it has a book of exercises uhm like as			
you said we do these excercises we give them these exercises to do at home			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
And uh there is a casette which goes with all the			
lessons in those uh in the books are recorded on the casettes plus there			
are some oral exercises on the casette which we do in class uh			
Uhm uhm 			
Then which is not always very convenient because when we have			
a very big class of about hundred students to get them to hear the whole			
casette is uh it's quite difficult so			
Our set also goes with a casette but it is optional			
Sometimes casettes are available sometimes they are not			
available 			
But when they are available they are very useful			
Yeah 			
So that way if there is a casette then you don't even			
need a teacher			
You can really learn the whole thing from the text book from			
the whole set			
You see it is a set which is very useful it is good 			
I like that very much but in fact I started this thing only to			
ask you about this 			
The problem we face is there are good text books like this uh			
 Russian for Everybody but they are simply not			
available now because of the Soviet Union one word and			
all 			
 Yeah nor did our books uh our books are not			
available either because uh I mean they are available but uh they			
cost about three hundred fifty to four hundred rupees each			
Uhm 			
Which is uh 			
Very high			
Too high students can't expect students to buy			
them at all			
Uhm 			
So what we do is we get them xeroxed 			
Uhm uhm			
Means we don't get the book of exercises xeroxed those we			
pick out exercise which can be done by the students			
We get them uh typed photo copies uhm uhm just			
a few of them			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh the others we do in class			
Uhm 			
But the book as such we get it xeroxed the main book 			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh that it works out much cheaper than buying the			
book			
Uhm uhm 			
Means cost about eighty rupees to get 			
 the them xeroxed			
Uhm 			
I think okay only thing you miss out of the colours and			
uh means there is a lot of play on colours etc., in the in the book			
 pictures full of pictures you lose out on all that you know			
without uh with the xeroxed copy			
Uhm always this is the greatest problem we are facing			
We just can't buy books they are simply not available 			
Library of course has several copies but then these are all			
part time students yeah so we cannot give the books to them			
from the library if they take and if they don't return 			
it's a terrible problem			
 Yeah 			
 In fact they are not even among uh 			
Yeah they can sit and read it 			
Right they can sit but at home you required 			
require a text book when you are learning			
So text book has a 			
 So what have you been doing uh have you			
been xeroxing them or uh 			
With some great difficulty last year we could get uh a			
couple of books for some students 			
So they were even sharing books like uh one book for two			
students whatever was available 			
I don't know what will happen next year next year			
Can't you get xeroxed copies I mean uh			
Now xeroxing the whole set or whatever you know there are			
lots of pictures photos etcetera 			
And you cannot avoid it because uh you know photos are are			
going with the text 			
Yeah			
So every thing is uh text is there photographs are there			
 pictures are there diagrams are there all these things are there			
And if you want to take photocopies of the whole thing it become			
very expensive extremely expensive 			
Or may be you could uh may be get out some copies from			
the library and keep them with you and give them to the students in class 			
Not let them take them home 			
But if they don't return if they don't			
return means it will			
 But uh 			
Ha no you don't allow them to take it home			
You allow them to read them in class			
But at home			
Atleast in class they will have a book 			
But they badly require a text book at home 			
yeah how will you do the exercise how will you study 			
You have to kind of after going home you have to revise your			
lessons you must read what has been taught in the class			
 Yeah 			
Yes exactly 			
So you have to have the text books			
So it's a great problem we are now facing 			
I don't know what will be done in future maybe they'll			
 			
 But couldn't you have chosen uh some other			
book which is uh or readily available			
 Now the other 			
The reason uh problem now is that in fact no book is			
available not a single book is available even those which are			
popular			
Not even Wagner is it 			
 Wa even Wagner which is published in Delhi 			
and which is not available now 			
I thought Wagner was available in uh in uh			
Yeah right now in advanced diploma I am using Wagner and			
even that is not available now 			
Oh so you've you've still uh 			
Still I couldn't.			
We are producing a possibility of it. 			
Nobody has got 			
So you are still continuing with Wagner you haven't thought			
No Wagner I use for the advanced diploma course third			
year course first year second year I follow this Russian for			
everybody that's what I did do 			
 with my students now same batch which I now and then uh I have			
switched over to Wagner now now they are doing on Wagner in higher			
diploma			
But that is it the other two uh volumes to Wagner or			
is it just one book ?			
One book 			
 It's just one book			
Wagner is a one book of the huge sixty-two			
lessons			
 It's huge 			
I did my C O P to advanced diploma with Wagner 			
yeah Russian			
 Yeah 			
Uhm 			
But for the C O P we found it was uh too too 			
authentic 			
Uhm it is it is like an encyclopaedia			
 It's like an encyclopaedia it's uh 			
it's like a dictionary			
How exactly			
With a list of words which are very difficult to learn by			
heart and specially long Russian words which are impossible to remember			
 It's full of words words words words it's 			
like one word in Telugu and then actually when			
we were planning this there was one problem I was thinking about I			
thought I will discuss this with you because you know you teach French and I			
teach Russian 			
I also read some French 			
I did two years of French here uh Tutkar taught me Shastri			
taught me sometime Nelu also taught me for sometime 			
Anyway and you read some Russian 			
Yeah 			
See one observation I made always was while doing this			
French and while teaching Russian 			
You know my observations are based on uh not only just my			
first hand experience but also looking at the syllabi various			
Universities I know the syllabi of uh Nagpur University uh			
Poona University I've seen uh even J N U's 			
syllabus our own syllabus of Osmania University I know very well 			
What I somehow you know see is that in the French courses			
 there is some what uh of you know uh a little more uh emphasis on			
the oral skills speaking skills where as the written part 			
somehow gets slightly diluted it's not uh taught in such a			
nice fashion as the oral skills are taught 			
In the Russian it is the other way round 			
Yeah there is emphasis on the wri on			
 the written uh yes 			
 In Russian 			
 On the written skill 			
Yeah in the Russian classes uh you see we 			
given give them so many exercises they go on doing			
them like mathematics so they are very good at reading and writing 			
they write well they answer questions they do exercises but when it			
comes to free conversation like this oral conversation you know just speaking			
like this in uh among people they are so shy of doing it 			
They can't do it Russian students somehow just can't speak			
Russian whereas French students I feel when they write they uh commit			
quite a number of mistakes you know lots of mistakes but when			
they speak they are so fluent you know they just very fluently speak			
 even among themselves even when nobody is watching even when there is			
absolutely no need for it I feel French students you know uh they			
love to speak French 			
Archana akka how are you ?			
I am fine how about you ?			
I am also fine 			
So how did you perform in your exams ?			
Quiet well 			
This time let's see what happens

Everybody uh every student belong to different part of			
this country uhm and I think its a miniature India there 			
And uh we we we get together and uh we we enjoy			
the life there anyway 			
 Uhm 			
I know hostel is a very freaky kind of place			
You can enjoy your life like anything 			
Yeah thats there 			
 So 			
So how many room mates do you have wi with you ?			
I am having two room mates 			
And they are belonging to ?			
One belongs to Raichur and the other belongs to Mumbai 			
Mumbai ?			
Yeah 			
He must be a very freaky kind of fellow and laughs 			
Yes certainly 			
How about the Raichur guy ?			
Raichur guy is quite nice 			
So they are both are Kannadigas 			
Yeah both are Kannadigas 			
They know Kannada 			
They know Kannada 			
 Mumbai Mumbai b boy is born and brought			
up in Mumbai and so he is a Mumbaii 			
 So 			
 Accha he speaks in Marathi also

 Accha how about the other batchmates ?			
Other batchmates uh two two guys belong to Calcutta 			
and two Rajasthan and some belong to Bihar			
Though all that we have every every places from every			
places we are having each and many of the boys they are some are			
some are from Jammu and Kashmir that means it means uh it's			
 a miniature India I said before 			
So who is your hostel warden ?			
Hostel warden is Rajshekar Patil sir

 ?			
Computer it it plays a great role because we			
are having computers in each field now-a-days			
And so if I like uh if I connect the computers and the			
automobile or person uh handling the computer in the automobile			
field they are getting good jo good jobs and they are			
getting good handsome salaries also

the theatres are good and the but it's it's mere a			
time-pass area			
Okay			
People hardly hardly concentrate on studies there I mean

Varadh 			
Uh he is a very strict teacher I think			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
He used to scold even the architecture guys and girls			
also because chemistry department it's on the first 			
floor of uh of the architecture department so we			
people were always scared about laughs because he used to come and			
scold everyone who used to sp speak loudly 			
 Haan they did 			
 Haan haan 			
 Yeah arti arti students they loiter about in			
the corridor			
 Accha 			
They always they miss Varadh sir always find them loitering			
about in the corridor and says hey what are you doing here just go			
and sit in the class laughs he says like that always 			
Archana are you there ?			
Yes I am there			
How are you Sonali ?			
I am fine			
How are you ?			
How are your studies going on ?			
They are going on pretty well but I am now reading for the			
examinations that are going to come up in April or May 			
Why ?			
I don't know I have not been studying too much that is why 			
What has happened Sonali you were a too studious girl I think			
Yeah may be because now-a-days I just keep thinking of one			
of the ideas I am getting			
Thinking of what exactly about getting married ?			
No not marriage marriage is another two to three years			
 uh before that 			
 Uh too long I think Sonali			
No because before that I have to sit for my civil services 			
I have to do I A S			
Oh it's really fabulous thing 			
Okay now I won't talk about that much of future right now			
I want to talk about may be say November December 			
About November December I did not get it Sonali 			
Okay I 			
 Can you explain it ?			
Okay here we go 			
I have this idea of conducting one fun-fair at the university			
Of conducting a pardon I beg your pardon 			
A fun-fair 			
Oh I think it's really a fabulous job 			
Thank god you appreciate it and you like it 			
I think it will create a history in our department uh not			
only in the department but in the university itself 			
Why ?			
Why because I think no one has uh conducted this fun-fair			
Before ?			
Yeah			
So that means we'll be the pioneers 			
Yeah laughs probably so 			
In fact you are the one who started the Mister English and			
Miss English competition also in the department 			
Yeah 			
Isn't it so ?			
Isn't it 			
Okay so now I'll start up with the fun- fair 			
The first thing is what you say should it be done on a			
Humanities department or a Humanities level as a whole or in 			
Eng English department level 			
If you ask my idea I think my opinion is that it should be on			
the Humanities level so that we can know each other 			
Yeah thats nice atleast everybody will be coming together			
So all the departments can come together we can just enjoy			
have fun 			
Yeah that will be gutsy imagine eleven department one hand			
 oh on one ground 			
 Oh 			
I am dreaming about that day laughs 			
Yeah but the thing is the first problem what I think we may			
face is the money 			
Yeah			
Because for any good thing and any bit thing you need cash on			
your hands			
So I think you have to plan it all 			
Yeah in fact I I just let me know because I am new around			
here so I don't know 			
Is it possible for the department to dish out some money or			
something 			
Ah yeah it's possible we can talk with Maya 			
ma'am 			
Yeah we can otherwise we also have a I think 			
department of social welfare which can give us money			
Yeah yeah yeah otherwise we can go for any sponsorship			
 Archies Hallmark they sponsor so they can sponsor			
But what will be the conditions and what are we supposed			
to offer them 			
 Nothing conditions I think uh 			
Okay like we can always talk about them we can talk to			
them if they are not charging going to charge or something very			
Okay let's see I will talk with them and let you			
know			
Okay and as for the stalls 			
You know one of the stall ideas I have is a request stall 			
Request stall I did not get it 			
I will tell you what a request stall is 			
You are supposed to have a music system on your stall that will			
be only system and or that is the only stall where you are supposed to			
play play music for the whole of the fun-fair 			
 Ok 			
 You can have a may be forty songs on the			
list 			
I think request songs is it ?			
Yeah request song it is and anybody paying you the amount			
you play their song for them 			
For them or for their people around or something like 			
that 			
 Okay so we can get money also I think 			
laughs 			
Yes you can earn			
See the basic thing of fun-fair will be one of this that we will be			
coming together 			
 Okay 			
 Secondly any fun-fair has to end in profit or in			
 pour income 			
Yeah I think it is yeah 			
 It is very difficult for a fun-fair to end			
up in a loss 			
Yeah yeah we have to consider the monetary part also			
Yeah monitory part is there but then again some other			
stalls 			
Can you think of some other stall ?			
Can you think of some other stall Archana ?			
I think you better think laughs 			
May be okay what do you say about an eats you should have			
something to eat upon also			
 Eats 			
Yeah eatables I think samosas will do			
 Samosas yeah that's not a bad idea			
then the chips 			
 Because they are chi uh cheap also 			
Yeah chips can be there 			
Yeah 			
And you can charge the double amount for them 			
I am getting hungry 			
Same here laughter but yaar we have			
to talk about it you know			
You have to talk about this and tell to the other classmates			
also 			
You have to take their yeses and 			
noes also			
I think Sonali you are the right person to take the			
initiative 			
Okay let's see that but uh and the next stall at			
but of course about double your money 			
I know it's a sort of gamble in the university campus 			
 but 			
 I think you should explain this thing 			
Yeah but Diwali is there come on 			
Diwali is supposed to be a bit of gamble a bit of paisa			
 money here and money there you know 			
So we can have a chakli stall also 			
laughs 			
You may 			
 Like Diwali stall 			
Yeah we can have it but in fact for double your money it			
is always like uhn you can have a car race stall 			
Okay			
That you through the dices and the person who			
reaches at next end the earliest the person earns double the			
money so if at one time you are getting ten people on			
your stall you pay one person twenty bucks and still you have I			
think ninety bucks on your hand or okay eighty bucks on your			
hand			
 Okay 			
 Okay 			
 Okay 			
 It's really a good idea I think 			
Anything new ?			
The new thing may be we may have a dance floor or			
something 			
Yeah I think rain dance 			
Yeah rain dance laughter but from where the			
water is going to come 			
We can go outside it's raining laughter 			
 That's not a bad idea at all but then we can			
always have something of uh you know what they call that lucky draw 			
you know 			
 Okay yeah yeah 			
Again we can have Miss personality Mister personality 			
Yeah and we have a Miss Rose too 			
Yeah			
How come there is no Mister Rose around why is always			
there is a Miss Rose you know 			
I think we this time we will conduct a Mister Rose			
competition also laughs 			
Uh Mister Rose competition			
Yeah 			
Not a bad idea at all 			
The most handsome boy will get the award 			
Yeah and the most beautiful girl will get the award 			
Oh			
That is the person who gets the maximum number of roses from			
the people around 			
 I wish I could get the award 			
Ahn that has to be seen there can be many competitors			
at that time you know but the thing is we have to let all the department			
in the university know about it 			
 In infact the people outside the department also 			
may be the colleges or something 			
Yeah we can popularise it to the newspaper T V media like			
the cable news 			
 That is going to be an expensive 			
The thing can be you can have some what you call the			
notices and then just go and just put them up in the colleges 			
the different departments of the university physics department is there 			
you don't have any interaction with the people from that department 			
Yeah yeah yeah 			
Chemistry department the geography department is also there			
I think we can make it on the university level also like 			
all other departments excluding uh including the humanities and also the			
science computer this thing we can include all of them 			
But then that will consume lots of time and after December			
 please no more active activities only 			
 I know studies are there			
Studies are there 			
This is M A part two with final year 			
And after this I will be thanking god like anything if I just			
complete this M A with good marks 			
Sonali don't worry you'll complete it 			
I hope I really hope			
I scored pretty good marks in my first year but I don't know			
what is going to happen in second year 			
You will score yaar believe in god work			
hard 			
Hey speaking of this uh M A and what do you plan to do			
after M A ?			
Now let's see I'll just finish my M A			
 and then god knows 			
God knows are you planning to get married or something 			
I don't know probably may be laughs 			
May be of course fifty percent of the class girls will be			
 married by the time M A completes up 			
Anyway I I have in fact planned about doing I A S now			
My parents wanted it and in fact first I was			
thinking of becoming a lecturer only but then something happened and now			
 I am going to sit for I A S			
 Married yeah 			
 Vow 			
I think you can be a lecturer better 			
 Yeah that is it is a job and it is the			
profession I love 			
I love to teach but let's see what happen in the			
future mean NET and SET are to big hurdles that are standing in the way			
 in I A S also similar one word 			
 Oh 			
 But they are channel uh 			
challenged I think you can accept the challenge 			
I can let's hope god is on my side and we			
compete in a proper way 			
And what about you like you are doing a computer course			
now-a-days			
Yeah right now I am doing my computer course so so			
after the M A I think I better do my computers continue my computers 			
Continue your computers and what about the job or			
something			
Job let's see 			
I have my own school like my aunty has my school so I can work			
over there 			
You worked before somewhere 			
No sorry 			
I worked for two months with a private firm and it was one			
good experience you know			
So you have to give a party I think pending laughs 			
God why do all these people just go for party yaar			
 you never asked before 			
 Because you have got your own money			
I had it I spent it I have blown it up laughs 			
This is not fair Sonali			
It is it is in fact it was a good experience the			
confidence I have in me now to handle different kind of			
people 			
I mean people can be rude if they want to be and they can be			
very sweet if again they want to be			
 Yeah yeah 			
I think now-a-days everyone needs exposure 			
Everyone needs 			
 Isn't it ?			
Yes 			
That is why I am sometimes surprise to see the girls out here 			
like when we have a welcome function I was the only girl who danced 			
two words you know and rest of the girls okay there were another			
two of them who were going to sing or something but you you ask them			
to do a group activity maybe a group dance or song none of them come			
forward			
I don't know why do they have this inhibitions about themselves			
You know Sonali I always dream that I I could dance like you			
Thanks a lot for the compliment 			
 It's a god given gift I think 			
Thank you so much but this is			
Which is I can only do I think Ganpati dance			
 laughter 			
That is also true art there you know to dance like a god			
But in fact I feel I feel sometimes very bad when I see my own			
 friends gi girl friends			
Oh oh oh			
I don't have any boy friends don't look at me like that			
Oh oh wondering are you telling the truth laughter 			
Yes a proper truth 			
In fact it is very sometimes it is very hurting to see them			
just sitting there like somebody should go to them and then they			
should be told to do something no initiative 			
 I think they need exposure thats the 			
lack they are lacking it			
Yeah that is why I wish all of them should work atleast			
for two months on hand and they should come to see the world properly			
The feel of your money on your hand is very different 			
Yeah yeah 			
It is			
I am dreaming about it 			
Yeah we can just dream 			
So what are your different uh what are your other hobbies ?			
What all you do at home ?			
Hobbies okay 			
 Like to cook 			
Cooking leave aside cooking is too far from me laughs			
 kitchen			
I think I like to roam about 			
Yeah I have seen you do that laughter 			
 Then 			
Oh so you were also roaming laughs 			
No I was purchasing some vegetables for home laughs 			
Then I was also purchasing something			
No no you were not laughs you were not			
Again chatting with my friends enjoying life 			
watching T V			
Yeah that is one pass time everybody loves 			
 Television 			
And another thing is just watching cricket			
Cricket

 It's really a interesting game			
 yaar 			
They are twenty-two people just after one ball you know			
somebody trying to hit it and somebody trying to catch it			
Oh 			
And sitting for three hours and			
I think you are too boring laughter 			
No no I am not see see just imagine you sit for			
nearly two and half hours in front of T V trying just tensing			
yourself so badly that your fears are standing on your nerves end and			
everything is in such a halobalo at home of course I have seen my dad			
Hello sir please sit down here 			
Here 			
 Haan 			
I am M G Hegde from Kunta Karnataka 			
 It's in north Canara district 			
Kunta is in north Canara district 			
You might have heard of Gokarna 			
Gokarna 			
Yeah my place is very near to Gokarna 			
 Accha 			
And you 			
I am from Malkhed Karnataka 			
It is in the Gulbarga district and uh you might have heard			
about the Rastrakutas and all 			
Oh ah ha Malkhed happens to be ah yeah 			
happen to be the kingdom			
 Ah yeah 			
Capital uhm capital city of this Rastrakutas			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
And uh it is at one time uhm it is said			
that it is uh it was bigger than uhm it is a big city			
 uhm of India what we see now uhm uhm uhm 			
so bigger than that one 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm uhm 			
Uhm 			
It was said like that and uh some more historical places			
are also there 			
Uhm 			
And uh another thing is that there is uh 			
math Anandi Math 			
Of which community 			
Of Brahmin's community 			
And uh you might have heard that there are two sects in 			
uh among the Brahmins only			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
Uh usually there are many but primarily			
Vaishnavites 			
 Shaivas and Vaishnavites uhm			
So acharya whose samadhi 			
is there so he belonged to the Vaishnava sect			
Uhm 			
And just like how we see in one word 			
sanjeevan samadhi uhm our Raghvendra 			
Swamiji had taken			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
Like that the one word say it is 			
 uhm and uh he is called as the Tikacharya also 			
uhm because he had written commentaries uhm on uh			
 the works of Madhavacharya you might have heard about 			
Madhavacharya 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
So in this way that Malkhed has got its own			
importance uhm as being historic historical uh see			
spot as well as uh religious sort of so			
 Uhm 			
 One word uhm 			
Well Malkhed is mentioned in in many of the history texts			
Yeah 			
But uh my place is not so the history of North Canara 			
 haan is not known at all 			
Though uh probably uh from the religious point of view			
Gokarna is rather known but for the bu but for that history of			
the place is not really uhm uhm yet yet to be explored you know			
 Haan 			
Uhn			
There is lot of scope for uh research 			
For research 			
Researchers because there were many kingdoms small			
chieftains 			
Chieftains 			
Uh belonging to the Vijayanagara Empire			
Uhn 			
Uhm Chintanani you must know that one time it			
was Chedas stronghold two words was Chedas			
stronghold 			
 Stronghold yeah 			
And later uhm when Swadhi kings acquired the area uhm			
mm they they were Brahmins mainly 			
They convereted all these Jaina temples into uh 			
into Jaina uh viharas structures 			
vihars into temples			
 Temples 			
 Vihars 			
In fact it is said even Gokarna Mahableshwar temple is one			
such Jaina architecture 			
 One word 			
 O one is one is not very sure of it but 			
 lot of research is uhn uhm is going on now-a-days 			
 ah ha but uh and also pre-historical monuments are			
found in the area 			
That way it has acquired lot of significance ah 			
from that point of view histo point of view of historical			
research 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
 Ah ha 			
 Ah 			
By the way where do you work 			
I am working at malkhed only 			
Malkhed there is uh one factory Rajashree cement you

And uh in that Jain basti there are			
some models of uh ancient bastis 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
It is uh totally neglected by the department of archeology			
Uhm 			
Once uh I had gone to archeological department and uh			
 I requested them to take care of all these valuable things			
 uhm what all have remained there 			
And the key the key of that basati is given to			
 one of the persons who is not belonging to that sect 			
 uhm I mean Jain			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
So there is possibility of happening anything at			
any time			
Uhm 			
But they assured me that they will they would take care of			
that one and then many times I took children also uhm 			
to that basti to show them 			
 Uhm 			
Now one uh ruined fort is there fort is there			
Uhm 			
And it's uh illegally occupied by some of the			
people uhm there and they have made homes 			
There they have constructed homes there and one person is			
living as if he is the king ah and his car you know it			
goes upto the top of the fort			
 Uhm 			
 Ah 			
 Laughs 			
Ahn and he has used the the place where the			
palace once palace might be there and that portion and the			
remaining part he built uhm an antenna he has fixed it			
there at the top 			
 Uhm Laughs 			
So his car goes upto that top of that uh 			
mound			
 Mound 			
What all what all mound is there inside the fort			
Uhm 			
And uhm apart from this uhm recently one historian			
visited that uh place			
Uhm 			
And uh he is conducting lot of research in this			
regard 			
He told that that fort it was actually not build by the			
Rastrakutas the fort existing fort 			
It was build by these kutubshahis 			
Ah ha 			
 Kutubshahis so the remains what all			
are there uhn the partial portion uhm of			
the fort outside and that is the ancient one you know what I mean by that			
 it's such one word 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhm 			
Uhn 			
The remaining what all we find now that is all that			
was all uhn constructed by the kutubshahis 			
But uh inside there is there are some gates within			
that fort 			
But there we find that the image of Mahavira at the entrance			
 and all 			
So it means that some of the remains are there which			
 are belongs to the rastrakutas 			
Well how many teachers are there in the staff in your school			
Uh we are uhm forty 			
Oh quite a big school it is			
Yes 			
 It's affiliated to C B S E uhm C B S E			
 its plus two uhm pattern school it is 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
But you have the classes upto tenth 			
Upto twelfth standard 			
Eleventh and twelfth that's called higher secondary			
school 			
Ha ha it it includes uh plus two plus two			
classes 			
 Plus two classes yeah 			
Junior colleges 			
Not it is yeah it is 			
 Junior college and and high shcool 			
 combine 			
 High school combined			
Uh uh composite composite junior college			
Composite junior college 			
Uh uhm something like this			
Yeah something like this 			
We have very few of them that composite schools			
Uhm 			
Uh partly uhm in one word nearby well here			
villages are all so near to the uh taluka place			
you know 			
They are not that far off 			
Maybe because of that we don't have many junior colleges but			
colleges rather over populated 			
We have more than more two thousand five hundred students 			
More than two thousand 			
Five hundred students 			
 Five hundred students 			
And all sorts of courses are also available 			
 Very considerable strength ahn 			
Arts Science Commerce Polytechnic and uh so			
many vocational courses so these are offered 			
And staff consists of sixty-five plus fifteen plus fifteen			
plus eight			
Uhm 			
Such a big staff and English department in the			
English department we have seven plus two plus one plus one 			
We don't have any separate departments but the thing is			
that our school it is uh run by Rajashree Cement 			
it's financed by Rajarshree Cement			
Uhm 			
And administered by Bharati Vidya Bhavan 			
You might have heard about Bharati Vidya Bhavan 			
Now this cement factory people have no business over your			
administration			
No 			
 That's sort of			
But local committee is there 			
Uh ha 			
They have formed our local committee but the thing is			
that they they are financing 			
But in the day to day administration			
Administration it is all done by Bharati Vidya Bhavan 			
So they don't interfere			
They don't interfere but they have right to interfere			
Uhm laugh 			
That is there because they are financing			
Uh that's what I am uh asking about			
 Uh 			
Another thing is that it is uh only uh it is far away			
from uh our locality because it's our kendra			
 our school belongs to our Kurkunda Kurkunda also one more			
school is there 			
Uhm			
And			
So one word the transferrable things then you can be			
transferred			
No no it is not our jobs are not transferable			
Uh 			
Once we get appointments means over			
Uh 			
We have to serve there only whenever we get the			
appointment order if you want to transfer again you have to appear			
 the interview			
Uhm that would be a fresh appointment			
Fresh appointment 			
And your service will be not counted			
Uhm 			
If you seek any 			
In the private colleges well this transfer business 			
 uhn is possible but one one has to forgo uhm seniority			
 Uhn 			
Seniority 			
You will be the junior most on the on the college that			
you joins 			
And uh but in salary he is protected and but for that 			
both the management should agree			
Agree 			
Uh this management should be ready to relieve you and			
that management should be uhm ready to uh take you in then only such			
transfers are possible 			
Uhm normally uhm well people are not transferred 			
They don't want transfer now because they can			
live a settled life 			
 Now 			
 Only only when the management has more than			
one college probably transfers are possible uhn or			
private colleges			
 Uhn 			
In fact we requested our management to transfer us			
To 			
To some of the shcools of Hyderabad and let			
the people of Hyderabad come here and serve			
 What what 			
What advantage do you have 			
No because at least there will be a change 			
There will be a change because uh one way you get uh			
fed up of the environment 			
Hey			
Uhn because it is uh factory area			
Especially uh			
Factory area and uh mostly polluted area it is			
Uhm so one does not like the area 			
 Due to the storm of dust and all so			
One doesn't like to stay in the area			
One doesn't one doesn't like to stay there and			
Hyderabadi people are very happy			
They are very happy or just because Kurkund in			
Kurkunda also there is one cement factory C C I has opened uh means			
set up one uh factory there cement factory there 			
And our school okay it is also near to Rajashree Cement			
Uhm 			
So in this way the totally the environment is 			
polluted			
Uhm uhm			
By these uh by these cement factories 			
How many schools were there in Hydera one school			
in Hyderabad			
I know in Karnataka I think all over Karnataka only 			
two schools are there			
And in Andhra Pradesh 			
 Whereas in Andhra Pradesh many schools are			
there 			
So there there also this factories must be in Andhra			
Pradesh 			
No no what I tell you I am talking about Bharati			
Vidya Bhavan 			
Uh			
 Bhavan's schools 			
Uh uh 			
In uh Karnataka			
It is financed by these uhn and else where			
may be some other			
 Uhn 			
Else where some other factories industries			
Uh ha uh ah 			
So they finance			
I understand I understand 			
So Bharati Vidya Bhavan people have such type of persons			
only 			
Uhn 			
Who can run the school laughs who can finance			
Finance the school			
And uh ah yeah run the school so that is the thing 			
In this way because			
And what about the salary and other things 			
Salary and all as per the grade 			
Government			
Government central government as the teachers get 			
 Kendriya 			
Uh yeah in kendriya vidyalaya 			
Grades are fixed as soon as you get appointment uh uh			
when the document will be given to you and in that clearly it is			
mentioned in which grade you are 			
Ah you you are placed			
You are placed that's there 			
Uhm uhm 			
And our Canara Bank is there 			
Uhm 			
In that Canara Bank we draw all our salaray so			
 that system is good uhm well furnished quarters are			
allotted 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
To all the teachers 			
You have cinema halls and all 			
Uhn 			
Cinema theaters 			
No cinema theatres 			
Uh the thing is that they have given this star plus			
uh cable			
 It is urban area 			
Or a rural area 			
It is urbanisation is taking place			
Ah yeah 			
The thing is that it is rural area only but uh the			
people are from all over india uhm they are staying here			
 Uhm 			
Uh getting cosmopolitan			
Cosmopolitan it is it is bit like that 			
So in this way our colony uh Aditya Nagar is			
 Aditya Nagar is just like a mini-India laughs I can			
say			
 Uh 			
Uhm okay fine 			
Hello I am Usha 			
And I am Rukmini 			
Say tell whatever you want 			
You studied 			
 Studied have you studied for tomorrow's 			
paper 			
Oh no I have to 			
And don't talk anything about the teachers because			
professor Patil will be reading about it laughs 			
I am scared about grammar what about you 			
I am scared about linguistics because we have to be very			
specific while writing the answers we have to study the definitions and			
all that 			
And I think grammar is worst 			
But grammar we can apply what we have studied to something			
Yeah but suppose we mistake in the class			
I will oppose we will make mistakes			
We will make mistakes			
However we try good shot			
 That's what I am scared of 			
What are you planning to do after you go to Hyderabad 			
After going there actually I didn't want to go 			
They will force me to go and after going there I have to go to			
the two words school and attend that uh youth			
parliament 			
How many days is the two days Parliament			
 Two days 			
 Two days 			
 Two days July first and second 			
And you booked your uh ticket from uh Hyderabad to 			
two words 			
Bangalore 			
Bangalore 			
So when will you be joining school 			
On uh fifth 			
Fifth of July 			
Fifth of July 			
And your girl daughter 			
My girl is there in Bangalore 			
My husband is there mother is there 			
 She is in Bangalore 			
So other day all of us will leave from Bangalore on fourth 			
Uhm 			
Fourth evening 			
And uh then you can't take leave na 			
once you join there			
Yeah I cannot 			
I must say in one way I am quite happy to go back to			
school but then everything will start all at once 			
And uh we cannot 			
 House activities and teaching tests you			
can't even take leave exact			
And once we start we cannot uh no question of stopping in			
 between also 			
 No question of stop 			
I thought actually that I would take some days off and take a			
holiday but it's just not possible you know with 			
And uh what about your uh that official order regarding			
the consideration of this			
No I don't have any such letter as yet for the time being			
I am only given a letter saying these three days you know twenty-seven			
twenty-eight twenty-nine I'll be considered on duty 			
But it seems Neeta has Nivedita has uh letter 			
 Yeah she has got a copy yeah of			
her letter			
Please pass it on because I have got one copy uh this Uma			
wanted it			
 Yeah 			
Yeah I know even I'll send			
It is the same letter we got at Hyderabad			
Yeah Hyderabad 			
Oh then I have given a copy of that			
This Geeta had given it to me			
Yeah yeah got it I had given a copy of that to school 			
but uh they have to get clarification about that 			
Who who has to get			
The school authorities 			
Yeah actually what happened was that in my case 			
 Because that letter to me it's true			
 copy			
Yeah in my case what happened know they send this to the			
Assistant Commissioner 			
And then a letter come from that Assistant Commissioner saying that			
 uh so many days can be treated as on duty 			
 On duty 			
So you will be given earned leave accordingly 			
 Earned leave yeah 			
 That's what uh even our principal wants to find			
out but I think they won't find out we'll have to go back and			
set out start the whole thing 			
So he is not uh he will not 			
No no I mean she is not refusing			
Uhm 			
But uh she won't write to the Assistant Commissioner 			
 you know I mean unless I remind her 			
 Why why 			
 I think she's will do 			
She will do it unless only if I remind her 			
How is she 			
She is okay I mean laughs 			
No I tell you she rang me I mean know she has sent a letter 			
Uhm			
 To my house and I was supposed to go on the			
sixteenth and it was for eleventh standard admission 			
Oh god I tell you 			
 Uh ha 			
Now what about the twelfth standard results 			
God knows I don't have any idea about school result			
I haven't been to school 			
I heard that in our shool the highest was eighty-four			
percent the highest rank 			
But uh how did you get the news 			
Oh letter			
 Two words 			
Not letter before I came here no I went to our 			
prinicpal's place and we had got the information from somewhere else			
Uhm 			
Like that I came to know 			
Because I haven't botherd to ring up school and uh 			
secondly there is nobody staying near my house 			
Still I had asked Savita na her son is in our			
school eleventh satandard 			
Now in twelfth he he could find out from the neighbours and all			
 but our one word must have forgotten also 			
Everybody so worried about the exams and studies 			
Now today Grace madam has aksed us to write that			
uh 			
 Go back 			
Oh yeah oh god that			
In about uh the 			
We had suggested actually about practice teaching to 			
our teachers only we had suggested that that they should have you know			
first of all some sort of a syllabus even for that 			
And the two teachers who teach should preferably teach as			
a pair 			
That is you know you start off a topic I continue and complete it			
or something			
Yes 			
Instead of like one doing composition and other doing			
poetry and thing like that 			
Certainly you can write that again in hour 			
Uh what day uh told was we talked about this			
to Julka madam 			
 Study 			
Uhm 			
And then uh she was telling that uh this kind of a			
thing would actually limit the scope of a teacher 			
Like if we prescribe a syllabus we will have to adhere to the			
syllabus and so we cannot uh 			
True but see they are not very happy when we do poetry			
 or prose			
Yes			
Isn't it 			
So why not nea completely eliminate that all together			
 because one side you also have to see the learners 			
They have come for some particular course 			
Yeah one word 			
And you are sort of just throwing anything at them which you			
 find conveninent and then plus the tutors are going to turn			
around and say that of what use was this to the learner			
And at the same no that's what she told when uh			
 a question was raised like this last time 			
I think others uh proficiency classes by the faculty members			
 uhm it was started just uh two years back 			
 It's because of this some other participant they			
complained about this and uh then they started one word they			
started this particular 			
Method			
Uhm 			
Because such a one word 			
So they'll benefit out of the faculty teaching			
Uhm 			
And notes			
But even that is not fair no it's like we use them			
for one hour as guinea pigs			
Yeah 			
Only for one hour they are taught by the other			
professors 			
No this way what will happen is we could try out new			
techniques 			
Otherwise poetry or prose we follow the old method 			
Say we would uh get other variety you know like 			
writing skills there are so many you can teach them 			
And you may take up speaking skills listening skills I think			
that area is big enough yeah no 			
Areas which have not been touched upon till now 			
 It's not really as for two words 			
 yeah			
You could easily do it and that one month would really			
help them 			
 It's not only one month it's a three			
week course which they have 			
And it will also give us the chance to try out new methods			
Uh I am not very sure how many will go back 			
Even means like I try out some methods but with the time			
problem always over there you can't always have all kinds of new			
methods to do cough 			
So may be then secondly again like we had talked abot having			
only one practice teaching instead of two 			
It seems before they had three			
Yeah I know that			
And Julka ma'am was telling that they were lucky			
because they could take the best two 			
Best two 			
Now here bu but when we told that here we have			
to take only one			
They should take but they are not doing that			
They they are not doing that			
They want to combine both and keep on the average			
And people like me who got the first chance do you know it is			
really difficult for us 			
Uhn that's true 			
No no			
No then I think they could you know either start the			
course a little earlier and give us say three four days to get used to			
the idea or because though they send you material saying you must get			
ready for your lesson when you don't know the learners 			
I know			
How will they prepare 			
 And not only that they have told that they will			
help us with the materials if we don't have any materials with us 			
But here after having come here I don't think uh there was			
 Nothing was available 			
The library was not available 			
 Uhn library uhn library facility was not there			
 It's a big draw back and specially Jaikar is			
quite a good library 			
So I think we should have had the chance 			
Though how much reading we would have done is anybody 			
 anybody's guess			
Yeah that's what uh 			
Again classes bit too long I feel five O'clock			
 is tiring 			
And what happens when special classes are taken in between			
Uhm			
Some two to three			
Three and all one word very sad thing 			
You have to go quite a long way from here 			
Yeah quite a way 			
Uhn 			
Uhm it's an hours journey no almost 			
 You have one bus or you have to change the bus			
 Two words 			
No I have to change because there is no direct bus and			
specially two words 			
But at what time you start from home in the morning 			
Today I started at about eight eight quarter past eight			
because the exam is at ten 			
The exam the classes were at nine then I left home by about			
quarter to eight			
Eight 			
Okay because it will be now in the school they			
haven't started 			
And Marathi medium school timings are different so it's 			
okay 			
Otherwise it's a problem 			
Like for my own shcool I leave my house at half past seven 			
What about your school is it near your house			
No not at all 			
The same distance my house to the University the same distance			
from my house to the school 			
Another direction 			
Completely 			
Did you go to main street 			
No no I have never gone anywhere 			
 You didn't go shopping anywhere 			
No 			
I will be going on twenty-ninth twenty-ninth evening 			
When when is your train 			
Thirtieth 			
Thirtieth evening 			
Thirtieth evening 			
Oh ho so you have to stay one day more 			
I will be staying in my cousins place			
Uhm 			
So her mother is here she told she'll take			
me for shopping			
Uhm			
And then after that next day we are going for sight seeing			
What about this C I E F L Rama Matthew's 			
evaluation 			
Uhm I think they are starting that uh workshop from			
 July fifth 			
Something like two words this Uma's got			
a letter my letter stuck in			
I met Rama Matthew from here uh she had come here			
actually 			
When 			
Uhm during the first week of her 			
Course 			
Uh course 			
Uhm uhm no I didn't meet her when Rajni Badlani had			
also come 			
I don't know who visited that time uh she had gone to one			
of the classes 			
Uhm uhm 			
Uh 			
You mean			
 One word lady with bobbed hair			
Yeah yeah fair very fair 			
 That women no 			
And uh she drapes her saree like that			
Yeah 			
She doesn't one word 			
Exactly she's Rama Mathews she is			
Rama Mathew			
 She is not very fair 			
She is Rama Matthew			
I met her at Hyderabad in December when we went for this			
uh the R P training she had come over			
 Two words 			
It seems there is a letter which says that this workshop is			
some something one word you 			
 No but its not compulsory only if you 			
 want you can come 			
 No it's not compulsory but I would			
like to go definitely but then 			
 I told her I will be in Hydrebad till			
second then she told you stay back for five more days 			
I told that's very difficult from seventh May I have			
been travelling			
Yeah 			
 It's really very difficult I am sorry 			
She told okay it's okay uh any way you have done this			
much 			
I didn't do much you know I only did two uh ob 			
uh observations			
You sent the second one 			
I sent both yeah both I sent 			
But I couldn't observe any uh old class change 			
Uh even I one word 			
It isn't possible only the new nine 			
And our school is also not so near to any other school you			
know and with the main problem is that board exam is on my head 			
so what happens is I cannot take a half day off and go and observe in other			
schools 			
But like this year if I have to do it I will try to be a			
little bit more systematic 			
Secondly more time that we came to know			
So this year there will be tenth standard observation also			
For the new tenth			
For the new			
And the new nineth			
She told the materials will be sent by the end of July			
Uhm no that's okay because you get August			
September that time it came very late by the time I got that it			
was settled 			
 I got that even got that two words 			
Even I got in the third week			
Because no pro point in doing that			
And by the time all the students had left for the study leave			
and all that			
All sorts of things yeah			
So I wrote a letter immediately saying that I will not be			
there			
And when I sent mine I also wrote a letter saying this			
problem is there and the two observation that also the first observation			
I did in rough thinking I wouldn't be able to manage but it was okay 			
So I sent it in rough with my report set up and uh second one			
of course I did 			
And you get the xerox uh done after sheet observation sheet			
No no no			
Then 			
My name is Vina Menezes I am from Goa 			
Hello Vina I am Charu from Pilani Rajasthan			
Oh it's nice to meet you here in the			
 Yeah it's really indeed very nice we all			
have come so far from our different places to this place to attend this			
programme 			
And it is really nice that all of us has come so close			
here together 			
 Yeah and we met each other and so friendly we			
became here 			
Yeah			
So you tell me now something about Pilani 			
Like uh you know the climate and uh on the on the ways of dressing			
of 			
 O okay about climate first of clears			
her throat 			
 Yeah 			
 Pilani's climate is uh very varying because you			
know it's a desert desert area			
Oh			
So summers are too hot too hot 			
 Hot 			
And what about monsoon			
Monsoon we rarely get any rains uh say say in September			
 when the monsoon is receding from India then we get rains for four or			
five days and that too very slightly 			
 So nice you know like that hope it was the			
case in Goa also			
You have heavy rains			
Yeah Goa it's raining very heavily and you can't go			
anywhere out also uhm			
Yeah that is there in Goa also			
Even when you go to school or anywhere out you			
have to face a lot of problems yeah standing because of rain			
 here there and all 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
And all the water would get clogged here and			
there			
Even traffic and all is getting jammed uh uh then			
you have to wait there till it get ah ha clear and all			
And what about the summers			
 Ah 			
 Uh uh 			
 Ah ah 			
Summers are well they are very hot 			
I don't suppose you have so hot summers in Goa because			
Yeah Goa is not that very hot			
You know summer I think that is the right time you can enjoy in Goa			
We have lot of social activities uh cultural activities that			
time you know 			
That is the right time I think if you come to Goa you will enjoy			
 uh uh and not rainy season I don't will not advise			
any one to come laughs in rainy season			
 Uhn 			
 Uh uh 			
Yeah 			
In Pilani it's just the reverse you know what is rainy			
season for others it is pleasant season for us			
 Yeah 			
So you must be enjoying that season			
That season yeah			
September and October we enjoy a lot			
Uhm			
But summers are June and May and June it's really			
horrible because the temperatures shoot up nearly to fifty			
 degrees 			
So it is just the opposite			
 One word 			
 Ah 			
Just the opposite exactly			
Even in winters it's so very much cold in Pilani no			
And summers are so hot temperature goes to nearly fifty			
Winters temperature go in minus			
Again because it's desert no			
So so high variation of temperatures 			
In Goa you won't have so no cool winters no			
 No 			
Yeah we didn't have 			
Cool winter 			
Very nice yaar 			
So much one word 			
Will you come to Goa 			
Yes of course I will come sometimes if god sends me and			
you too have to come			
God sends me means what you have you can come no like that

Okay let's see how and when do you write letters

 Pilani 			
Yes social life is there but uh there are not so many parties			
 uh as I suppose you have in Goa right			
Yeah we have too many parties and uh beach

You can really enjoy life in Goa you know			
 Uh

 And 			
Diwali also			
 They invite us and all no and we			
go to their place			
Even if we don't go to their places they make it a point to get			
the sweets in the school or wherever it is otherwise they'll pack it			
and they will give you yeah			
 Do you one word 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah that's two words 			
They used to yeah			
 Distribute them 			
And uh all illuminations and all everything is there			
Yeah yeah yeah			
Light lamp everything			
Yeah yeah yeah			
It looks beautiful			
Beautiful yeah			
Specially in the cities if you go no uhm you can			
really have fun			
 Uhm 			
And what do you do on your festivals 			
Yeah I know we are having uh uh different clubs like			
uh uh town-wise or village-wise and each club is organising			
dances beach shows and all you know			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
So you can have your choice			
Otherwise even on the accha yeah			
we are having different beaches and all no people go on the beaches and they			
enjoy			
 Accha 			
Uh like we have have cer 			
We don't remain in the houses			
Yeah yeah			
And houses no yeah we have pooja			
 and all these kind of things			
 Yeah 			
Ah we do all that			
And then you go to church or any other			
Yeah after prayer			
Home			
Yeah			
We go the church and all mass uhm and then after			
that we go for discos and enjoy 			
 Uhm 			
 Go and enjoy 			
Religious part is first and then the other things laughs			
Yes			
For us no what happens is first of all we have to do			
all the pooja and all			
Yeah that is religious you have to do that first			
Yeah haan and I think that			
is that occupies our most of the time			
 Haan 			
Ahm			
Particularly in Diwali days they have to do Laxmi			
pooja and all that			
Uhm there			
So so really if you started seven till nine pooja			
 and decoration and everything			
That you must do previous day na 			
No previous day we never do			
No			
Because the decoration and all 			
Same day you all do			
I think uh because			
No No in Goa we play we do the preparations much in			
advance not on the same day 			
 What happens that we have probably because			
people are now in service no			
So they can't do uh before hand			
So only the day of Diwali and all we we don't get so many holidays			
in between no one or two days 			
We have major holidays in winters and summer because of extreme			
climates			
 Uh 			
Like for example we have uh holidays for christmas no 			
 uhm 			
Ten days we have 			
You know we divide the days			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
Cleaning of the house or decoration of the house 			
 oh yes making sweets and then for the tailor day uhm			
Everything we do like this systematically and see that you are			
very much free on that day uhm festival day 			
uhm like that yeah			
 Oh yes 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
For us no we get two days on uh Diwali one Diwali day and the			
next day same must one or two words holi Diwa 			
holiday and next day uh 			
Otherwise we don't get any 			
So one day that very day you get holiday so whole day cleaning			
up and everything then preparing sweets			
 Uhm 			
Okay how you will prepare the sweets means only your family			
members prepare take part in your preparation uh or some			
neighbours come to no help			
 Uh 			
 No 			
We make ours neighbour makes theirs			
And now a days uh most of the people going in for buying			
sweets yes by readymade			
 Yes 			
Even that is the style now			
So do you think all a few words 			
 A few words 			
Yeah that's the problem			
Life is now becoming too much very busy and			
 Very 			
Yeah that's right			
Earlier too my mother used to make everything at home			
She never bought anything from out			
Now it is not possible yeah because you know			
every one is working 			
 Yeah 			
 Accha 			
Okay tell me something about your school where you go and uh			
Okay my school no is very far from my uhm 			
place			
I have to get up early in the morning uhm and by			
six I have to be on the bus stand 			
And then three four buses I have to change			
 It's very you know oh tiresome journey			
 and by the time I reach to school uhm you know what 			
I'll be and then after when the school gets over also after			
coming from that also I reach very late uh uh by four			
 O'clock like that 			
You must not be facing that problem you must be staying somewhere			
close			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Oh 			
 Uhm 			
 Uh uh 			
Yeah in Pilani we have a campus 			
Small campus and everthing is very much closely packed there			
 uhm like so everything is so organised no that			
everything comes within that area			
Nearly in two kilometers area whole campus has been made			
 Uhm 			
 Everything is there 			
 Haan so one word 			
And uhm everything is close by you just go to our			
Institute we have to go either we go walking or we have bicycle			
So nice it is yeah			
Very nice			
We can't do that because you know mine is government school			
no			
Yeah			
So even if I have to ask transfer I have to ask transfer in			
uh government school			
Uhm			
Private schools are there many			
Yeah			
But uh they are of no use for me because I can't take			
transfer in the government school in the private school			
Yeah			
I have to take in the government school because 			
uhm it is government school			
 Uhm 			
So it will take some time uhm transfer and			
all			
 Uhm 			
Yeah and government schools I think are better than private			
schools that's what atleast everyone says right			
They say but in Goa they have different view			
 Laughs 			
Their opinion is different			
Oh yes it means uh in north India atleast uh because			
for studying point of view I think private schools are better but uh			
It depends everything on the headmaster you know			
If the head is good everything is good			
Yeah that is there			
Because if the headmaster or the principal is very lenient			
then the teachers are also uh uhm very lenient they do			
what they want and then naturally it affects the students			
 Uhm 			
Yes			
So if he is good then I think everything goes smooth 			
So your headmaster's like			
Ah he's very nice to me 			
Uhm very nice 			
In our Pilani no			
 It's a private institution 			
Uh but uh uhm and nothing is so much controlled by our			
Director			
Director			
We have Director			
Yeah 			
Even we have in Goa two or three words 			
So teachers it depends lot on teacher how how he 			
handles his class and all 			
So we have particular hours allotted to us			
 Manages 			
We have to go there 			
Finally okay everything is regulated by the Director and all			
the staff authorities but we have so much uh like consciousness 			
 yeah means we have to do good we have to produce good results			
because finally it reflects by on us that's no how you			
were teaching			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah yeah 			
Yeah			
But sometimes I feel that in schools that kind of uh 			
mentality is not			
See I will tell you you are teaching in the school is			
better			
 I'm sorry uh teaching in the college is better			
than uhm the school			
Because in school there's lot of responsibilites are			
there			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
In the in the college I think there is not much			
responsibility as such			
Responsibilities like			
In the sense see you have to do your duty well teach and			
go like			
Uhm okay			
Prepare or teach and go			
But in the school what happens you have to see that these			
students learn			
Uhm			
Otherwise the headmaster will pounce on you			
Uhm			
However that the parents also come and complain 			
Yeah			
You can't teach in your own ways you know like you know if			
they don't know you should tell everything in English they don't understand			
you have to use mother tongue			
Uhm			
And if you use mother tongue uh they they			
understand but the thing is that your language English language is going down			
You get used to that language you know			
 Uh 			
Uh so because of that way lot of you know difference 			
I don't like to teach in school I prefer in the college only			
Uhn 			
Good morning sir 			
I am Mukta Mahajan I have come from Jalgaon 			
And uh my city is developing city and we are the			
natives of that city 			
My father is retired lecturer 			
I have three sisters and one brother 			
Ours is the family of teachers 			
And I have got the inspiration particularly from my father 			
My father always tells me that the position of a			
teacher is of a person who guides the society who guides the			
complete generation 			
And that's why I have selected this particular			
profession 			
 It's nice to meet a person who belongs to an academic			
 family I should say 			
 It's really true sir 			
And what brings you here all the way from Jalgaon to Kolhapur			
I have come to attend the refresher course in English 			
Have you 			
Yes sir 			
Is it your first or second			
It is the first refresher course I am attending 			
And I am feeling very nice that I am in the company of so			
brilliant brains and particulary the people I find here they are really			
 sunshine brain and moonshine heart 			
 Wah very nice 			
And how do you find the courses 			
Do you think that they have colleges wherever to what you teach			
in the classes 			
I think			
One difficulty is or one uhm shall I suggest these			
courses is that they are only of an academic nature very			
little to do with grammarian work in the classes ahn do			
you agree with this charge 			
 Ahn 			
Yes I do agree with this charge because the classroom			
situation is completely different and we are uh told here about			
 ideal conditions			
Yes			
If we cannot really apply reality and while teaching a			
particular text or a particular portion we have to face lot of problems apart			
from the teaching itself 			
Yet you agree that ideals are good enough 			
Of course we need them to follow of course we			
need them 			
 To follow 			
We may say that ideals will cease to be ideals if they			
are attainable won't they 			
Yes it is really sir it is really true			
But unless we have ideals then we will go astray 			
They do show us a direction 			
Sir 			
And give us where we have to go and where we stand 			
don't they 			
We may go wrong but we we have that particular say a kind of			
lighthouse yeah and we have to travel in that direction			
 Yeah 			
So it it's a one word light you may say			
Sir yes sir			
That guides you on your career			
Yes sir 			
And how about this Kolhapur 			
 It's very fantastic city 			
For the first time I am enjoying the rain and cold and really			
thrilling one 			
And the beauty of nature and the greenery it's really			
fantastic 			
You don't have this in Jalgaon			
No no no it's completely hot and so so hot			
 that it becomes impossible for outsiders to stay in Jalgaon during			
the month of uh April and May particularly			
And perhaps you find it difficult to be here from your			
 a few words I believe			
 Yes sir 			
I I am feeling completely migrated bird you know 			
Do you 			
Yes sir			
But how is the migration from bad to worse or good to			
bad			
Well from bad to good 			
Bad to good			
Because man needs water to his to his 			
 roots so that uh as bud will come out and man will flourish			
 and here I am really feeling that sense of flowering 			
Nice you are paying a very rich tribute to Kolhapur 			
It it deserves sir 			
 And 			
And what about the historicity of this place 			
Have you visited any historical place			
Uhn ufortunately I could not sir 			
Unfortunately I could not because uh rain is so heavy that I dare			
not to go outside 			
Lack of opportunity not interest 			
No I I really interest I have really interest in seeing			
the sight which are you know well known for historical importance 			
but due to lack of opportunity 			
 Because of the vacation 			
Yes sir but I am I am deciding to visit the places 			
on Sunday some place 			
 There are different forts here you kown 			
 Panhalgad 			
Yes sir I know it 			
You must be knowing this all history don't you			
No sir 			
You don't know the importance of Panhalgad			
You don't mean that you don't know it 			
Pardon sir 			
You don't mean that you don't know Panhalgad			
 and it's importance in Maratha history 			
 I I I have read 			
Yes I have read a lot about and I have also asked my friends			
that we will we will go there but they said that due to rain it will be			
impossible to go there 			
And none of them is ready 			
That is one of the forts you know that immortalise that			
great partriot of course Baji Prabhu Deshpande			
 who helped Shivaji to escape from there from the seige of Siddhi			
Johar at one word 			
 Of course 			
 Of course 			
I have gone through the history			
I had been there 			
We had a taxi 			
It was a nice experience going there			
And unlike other forts it's not tiring business for			
 haan of environment			
 Haan 			
Yeah 			
You can take your taxi on the top 			
We can visit the places in the conveyer uhn and			
 it's very less tiring job 			
And there is another place also nearby 			
 Uhn 			
Which one 			
It is one uh two words 			
I like that main building particularly that statue of			
Shivaji Maharaj one word still it seems going to			
sky from the earth going from uhm to mean place to some where highest			
place and I really like that statue			
 One word that 			
Great men do have an elevating effect you know 			
Sir			
When you look them from the bottom to the top you feel going			
higher and higher			
Higher and higher 			
I really like that statue and I whenever I get a chance I go			
there and have a round and enjoy that greenery and structure and the 			
 atmosphere 			
 That means that means it must be quite an			
effort for a frail person like you laughter to do all these			
things			
It means both things I try to achieve just it's 			
a kind of exercise for me 			
And because I need it and I never get a chance in my city to go			
out and uh because it's so crowded and particulary there are			
no places in our city 			
When I come here in this uh area of University it's			
 really lovely place			
You are coming for the first time 			
Yes sir 			
You have never been this side 			
No 			
How did you come 			
By train 			
By train			
By train 			
You must be finding the journey very tiresome			
Very tiresome it's a long journey			
Especially after Poona 			
Yes sir 			
If the train becomes passenger and uh unbearable journey it			
becomes but I have no other way 			
Uhn which is convenient way to come to Kolhapur			
When are you leaving 			
On twenty first 			
On twenty first 			
The course is I think one word we finished			
on the nineteenth			
But I have got the reservation of twenty first 			
So you are overstaying a little			
Yes sir for one day			
Thanks to one word reservations laughter			
So that I will be able to visit the places I couldn't			
Ah you will have go shopping			
 Right a day gap			
 Uhm 			
Shopping 			
No I am not interested in shopping whenever I go to market I			
buy books only that is all 			
So you are a bibliophile laughter aren't you 			
So I would better ask you to go to the Mahalaxmi temple 			
have you been there			
Yes I've been there			
How you find the temple 			
 It's very lovely here one gets the you say			
 per perfect religious atmosphere and uh the faith in man			
grows when we go in the company of that structure only I I didn't I			
couldn't go inside the temple because I was in hurry but I have decided			
to go there on Sunday			
Do go inside 			
Of course sir 			
Because the one word and two words is very			
beautiful in name of the goddess			
Outside observation won't do always it			
becomes necessary to go inside and experience it			
 And there are lights also there 			
Unless you enter a temple laughter it is no			
visit to a temple you know			
Yes sir 			
 It's not a place of tourists interest			
But I have heard that fold your hands and your uh prayers			
reach to god 			
They do if you have faith			
 Laughs 			
There is no need of going to temple just fold your hands 			
and close your eyes and your prayer will go to god			
They do 			
And it will come true 			
And many times I had experienced it that I couldn't get a chance			
to go to temple and uh I just pray in heart and my wishes come true 			
One of my wish has come true that is uh acheiving this			
doctorate 			
Yes you have achieved a doctorate 			
Yes sir 			
What did you make research 			
American literature 			
I am interested in American literature and uh I have taken			
the subject uh in that uh uh A study of prose style of Ernest			
Hemingway with special reference to his novels 			
Hemingway 			
Yes sir 			
But who was your guide by the way 			
Uh presently he is the vice-Chancellor of Indore University			
 Dr S H Chandel 			
We have heard one word 			
Of course 			
Yes you were fortunate enough to get hold of him			
Of course of course 			
It was a nice experience for me to live in his company and to			
share his uh knowledge and to enlighten myself 			
Did you publish your research 			
Not yet sir 			
I have lost a lot of money and it has become a white elephant for			
me now a days and it will take a lot of time 			
But do publish it 			
Of course sir I will 			
Because it is very necessary for people to know			
Uhm everybodys research is uh his or her baby			
because it is yes it is one creation and everybody likes			
to see growing up and spreading 			
 Yes 			
And as the proverb go laughter like			
the mother like the baby 			
Ah ha laughs 			
So it must be two words excuse			
Ah ha ha 			
I am really glad to know that you have done this at a			
young age 			
It did with all the blessings of my parents			
They really made me uh they really allowed me to do			
otherwise girls are not allowed in our caste to study at such extent			
and but they allowed me 			
They created such a atmosphere in home that I I was not			
allowed to do any household work I was treated like a boy male person			
 That's very progressive you know			
Yes 			
In those days especially when cough daughters			
are looked down upon ah ha as the unwanted burden			
 Ah ha 			
 No no our parents gave equal treatment 			
 and 			
 You're you're fortunate			
enough in the sense I mean I mean 			
 Of course I am I am I am living in the blessed			
company of my parents I really love my parents and I am proud of them 			
That is very nice 			
And how many brothers and sisters are you 			
Uh we are three sisters and I have one brother he has uh			
completed his civil enigneering course civil and presently he			
is working as project engineer engineer in an International company			
 one word one word 			
 Civil 			
 Where where 			
At Jalgaon but he has to go uh to visit site 			
outside in any state			
Touring job 			
Yes yes touring job 			
Presently he is in Poona 			
Is he 			
Yes sir			
So you must have been to Poona to see him			
No 			
Didn't feel like going there there 			
 I I I I was feeling so homesick in the first week of			
course			
That you did feel like going			
 That I 			
Yes no no			
But couldn't make it			
I I I I asked my parents and my brother not even to ring			
me 			
So that I will remind them again and I will try to cry 			
So you just wanted to forget everything else and merge 			
 with all this things 			
 Yes I I wanted to cut all the friends 			
and wanted to be alone here so that I will be able to mix up with these			
people			
But I			
How come you are so home sick 			
Rather I am a bit emotional more emotional			
How did you manage your Ph D work 			
You must have been going there somewhere			
Yes yes but somebody used to come with me 			
Somebody used to come with me if if I had to stay there for two			
days three days either papa or my brother or my friend used to come with			
me 			
So you generally don't move without an escort			
Ah ha of course of course 			
Feminist will file a complaint against you 			
Let them complain 			
That you are not a feminist			
 What is I I am 			
No I I never uhm say that I am a feminist 			
And I want to to be a woman uh which is idealised by 			
people in our country			
All the best			
But don't you feel that it is time you stood on your own 			
and that			
 I'm trying I'm trying 			
So this is the first attempt			
Yes it is the first attempt and I am			
successful making it 			
 You have made it

Well they take education in my native place 			
Even though I serve in Umerkhed my family lives in 			
Dhanki Dhanki my native place			
Yeah yeah 			
I have got some fifty-two acres of land			
there 			
And after the death of my father uhm my mother			
didn't intend to come to Umerkhed and that's why I had			
to shift my family there			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
And so I come from Dhanki attend my college and then			
again go to Dhanki 			
Dhanki and Umerkhed they are not very distance places			
Yeah 			
The distance is only of eighteen kilometers 			
I have got uh one motorbike Rajdoot 			
and uh I take pleasure in attending my college regularly and			
again going back to my native place village 			
I am fond of farming also sir			
Yeah yeah good			
Uh how do you pass your time 			
Where here sir 			
No no not here in your college			
Uhm in our college sir I regularly have four			
periods			
Four 			
And then uh in the fifth period we shall be coming			
together and we shall talk together that way 			
Then in the afternoon once more I come to college then I			
will find out reference books that way			
Oh 			
Sir regarding my family I want to tell you that in			
all I have three kids 			
The eldest one he is uh in the third year of Engineering			
Oh 			
He is doing instrumentation 			
Where sir 			
In Shahada			
Shahada itself 			
Uh he got uh medal in the first year			
Uhm 			
Then in the second year also he stood first in the			
college			
Oh that's very good 			
Second is daughter she is uh doing polytechnic			
Where			
And she is in the second year same same place 			
And the third one is uh also a daughter 			
And she is in the fifth standard			
Fifth standard			
She is extremely beautiful that way 			
Uh regarding my side business I will tell you I have also			
 a piece of uh fifteen acres of land that way 			
Well			
It is fifty miles away from my place			
Oh from Shahada 			
Yeah from Shahada 			
After ten or fifteen days I shall be going there and I			
will look after the fields 			
Then who looks after that administration of your farm 			
I have I have put some men there one man is there he			
is manager 			
And he will uh uh manage everything 			
Uh there we take uh sugarcane then cotton jawar			
bajri and uh moongfali that way 			
Sir what uh crop is there say major crop in your place 			
Yeah it's uh jawar and cotton			
 Jawar and cotton 			
Because irrigation facilities are very less but still 			
I have got some irrigated land and there I take sugarecane I have			
also planted orange trees and I get uh very handsome income			
 yeah from those trees orange trees			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Well uh what about the climate of your place 			
Sir it is very hot there specially in uh April May			
June			
Oh that means Summer			
Of course monsoons they are of also very good but it is a			
hot place and uh			
Like mine			
Yeah 			
My place is also of the same climate 			
In the Summer it is too hot			
Too hot 			
While in the winter it is too cold 			
In summer we face water problem 			
Uh there is no such acute problem at Umerkhed but uh			
 in these days well we are facing that problem in my native place 			
Yeah 			
Because we all depend on tap water supply			
 from our grampanchayat and it's very			
irregular and many a time we get water once in a week			
 Yeah yeah 			
Yeah I one word 			
That way we have one word 			
Very terrific			
Yeah but there are some wells and uh my wife my			
daughters when they are at my home well they fetch water from a			
 kilometer distance 			
 That's very hardsome 			
Even many a time I employ my neighbours bullock			
cart is there and uh we fetch water from that well 			
Sir you just told me that uh the name of your place is			
Umerkhed			
Yeah 			
It is a village 			
No it's town 			
Town 			
Uh not village it has got a population of some uh			
thirty-five to forty thousand			
Yeah 			
But 			
In our place uh the names end in kheda 			
Yeah 			
Lonkheda that way Lonkheda 			
 Kheda means kheda it is uh a			
village that way 			
No no its not so 			
Uh this morning I was talking to you about uh anxiety and			
 uh my doctor has diagnosed uh anxiety uh neurosis			
Yeah			
Anxiety neurosis			
Yes uh I am prone to worrying and uh it can uh be			
really very difficult no			
When there is an event ahead of me like a journey or something			
 it builds up			
And any other certainty or any worry you know figures it out			
And uh one doctor friend said something about the autonomic system			
And uh my cardiologist says that uh when I have time he			
will conduct on me a thyroid test 			
Yes			
So what is that 			
Actually doctor Gup anxiety nerosis is not very			
uncommon disease			
I would say it's very common but it is not uncommon			
Uhm			
And this's particularly influences everybody easily			
is you will feel that you are vulnerable to the evil 			
Uhm uhm			
Whether they are physically weak whether they are uh			
travelling in a			
Uhm 			
So to get certain amount of worry and what the term we use			
of that you set a uh of small small things uh um 			
So it's not uncommon 			
And the best way to succumb to it is not to succumb to it 			
 Uh um 			
I see			
And to avoid it the best reason I will give is that you			
should think yourself that after all what is going to happen to me 			
Uhm 			
Just as last night I said that I'll get down at			
Parliament Street at eleven O'clock what will happen to me			
Uhm 			
And then immedietly I questioned myself what can happen to me			
Uhm 			
Nothing 			
Uhm			
 I'll get a cab			
See and go			
Uhm			
The best thing to avoid it that you reason it out			
Like			
Then after all what will be the result of this anxiety 			
 one word 			
 What'll be the worst comes then			
Yeah			
Yeah			
And this only increase your anxiety			
But if you will reason it out 			
Yeah 			
That these are the possibilities that can happen 			
Okay I am prepared for it			
Uh uh			
You know that a woman she is a apprehensive about			
many things			
What one can take from me			
Yes			
Oh this my small attache e-acute 			
case it can go I won't worry about it			
Yeah go and			
You want my watch no okay			
Gold chain I won't wear			
No I won't wear			
I I will not wear anything because physical hurt			
Okay if I've got the cash I'll give it to him			
Uhm			
That is the best way			
So that's one way of avoiding			
One way of avoiding			
But if you have got this is functional anxiety			
Ah ha			
But if you have really some uh medical problem that is to			
be checked			
For example that thyroid			
Yeah			
Say for example hyper thyroid people			
Uhm			
They get particular anxiety and for that they do certain			
tests of mainly that T three T four			
Uhm			
Thyroid distribulating harmones in fractions uhm			
 and T F H 			
So those who have got the defiency of thyroid they will have more T			
F H			
 Uhm 			
Ah ha			
Means that their pituary body is going to uh some extra			
factor by producing more thyroid stimulating harmones			
I see 			
T three and T four are less better indicator but T F H is			
 good indicator to diagnose early T F H see T three and T four they			
are directly related with hyper thyroid 			
So it can have a physiological correlater as well as a			
psychological one			
Yeah and most of the time it is psychological 			
So uh you have told me the way to fight the psychological			
fear			
 That's my way			
And uh the physiological thing will require some kind of			
pathological test 			
Yeah 			
So I should go in for that 			
Well if you feel that you really may have thyroid problem you			
should go			
But for thyroid problem there are one two indications 			
One is that loss of weight 			
Uhm			
Number two is			
Steep loss of weight			
Yeah steep loss of			
I have maintained my weight from first 			
 And uh rise in one word blood cell			
 One word means hundred twenty			
Yeah			
Upper limit of the blood cell			
So I have neither of these symptoms			
Yeah 			
My I mean I have less weight but it has been constant for ten			
years uhm like this			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
Or around the sixty-three uhm for uh kgs			
Or maybe it's less I don't remember but it is constant			
 Uhm 			
And			
And Dr Shastri you have seen me I don't think uh you notice			
much difference 			
 			
 No no no difference 			
 And then then there are other things that find			
 one word in the finger			
Ah ha			
And then the one word falling here the pro 			
 one word of one word they are late symptons			
I see			
But early is the indication of the thyroid rise in the			
 I see a few words 			
 I see 			
Uhm uhm 			
So actually uh I have been a diabetic and uh uhm 			
I had a cardiac kind of uh thing so			
They made me do the uh this one word test			
Yeah 			
And they said it's positive which means you			
know there is some error somewhere twice I did it			
Uhm uhm			
And uh my physicain wants to do it again An 			
and maybe I am mixing up several symptoms 			
Maybe that's not serious because I don't get any 			
pain in my chest			
Uhm uhm			
So this might be atypical but uh when I sort of run			
 for example yesterday I had to run a bit to catch a bus So I am			
a sort of that you know my breathing rate increases otherwise there is no			
problem and it comes down uh after sometime 			
So uh do you think I really have a problem there			
This is I cannot anwer			
Uh yeah			
Say for example after the age of forty or forty-five you			
are arrested to just uh this is sort of breath like rise rise uh			
 and get getting up by stairs uhm or running or			
strenous exercises common people heart is taking more strength that is 			
two words 			
 Uhm 			
I see			
And so we diagnose it as a cardiac problems			
You don't have to wait for angina			
But if you've two times your two words is tested			
 two words which means that you've a minor degree of 			
circulation problem			
Ah ha			
Only a minor degree of			
Yeah			
And then you are regulating the life uh life in a better			
way			
Yeah			
Mild exercises if you really two words that vital			
 capacity			
You doesn't do as your doctor suggests			
I will never say that you don't do what your			
cardiologist said is			
 Yeah			
You see 			
Yeah			
He suggested these tests he said first thyroid test 			
Uhm			
For this anxiety thing one word one			
word 			
 Yeah 			
Uhm			
Then he said another test we will take			
Uhm uhm			
And if necesary we will do angiography			
Yeah 			
Angiography is the last thing			
I won't advice you to go through lightly 			
Lightly means			
I know you will see the all process of that you are really a			
cardiac patient to go through the uh angiography			
So that will depend on the kind of uh yeah 			
results that the one word tests show			
 Yeah 			
I hope so			
Yeah			
I am not a cardiologist but I have a general			
knowledge of a medical doctor			
Something a methodologist I know a little more than uh 			
 But they do 			
Yeah			
Other discipline			
The set of uh intriguing think is that doctors don't			
look at the the the fregment test uh you know print out very one			
word you know 			
They just look at the summary given by			
So uh and that doesn't show where the narrowing is			
No that doesn't figure in the narrowing is			
And you know that regular test when a patient is really			
prominent one word of narrowing the process 			
uhm so that you can see can sometimes specifically in the angina when you			
know might have cardiac effect			
 A a and uh in faction uhm 			
and in fact			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
As a result of the effect			
As a result of effect but that occurs only in those who have			
got a serious two words 			
 I think 			
 They will not ordinarily occur in a person			
who has got minor problems			
And then there are indicators that the doctor will ask you			
immedietly to stop 			
Yes of course			
No no further tests should be done on him or her			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
He was uh an M D young and and he was present and he			
monitored 			
So I think we have several monitors like heart rate and blood			
pressure and			
Definitely 			
But I overheard saying you know if change back to normal very			
quickly			
How is it			
Like they accelerate the pace of the yeah 			
uh the mill 			
If it's twenty hours twenty uh twelve minutes thing			
So I think uh six seven minutes you know I was getting			
restless and then uh they slowed it down 			
 Yeah 			
You see on that question normally uh uh experts the			
cardiologist should decide but for me I'll not tell you straight way			
I see			
See we have not don't being a cardiologist I hope so that I			
am fully fit to answer this big question 			
Yeah			
Uh if I am faithful to myself but if I am getting			
this question and it should come back to normal I would say that a few			
words 			
Yeah			
You have got mild			
Yeah			
General common sense you can say			
Right			
You see 			
See these days we are getting more and more tests than			
Well it is good that it is diagnosed it 			
Yeah			
Because this should be done when and where the one word			
 expect 			
 			
Well you could perhaps you know get back to diabetes uh I am			
a little affected Uhm if you can uh repeat I mean uh problem that			
justification of that one word uh one word for both of us			
Yeah 			
Actually my diabetes is under control			
In the beginning I had no concept of calories and so on 			
The usual notion given two words sweet 			
Now uh you know for a year I I joined a diabetic clinic which			
is exclusive for diabetics 			
And the doctor you know uh say he didn't say this like I			
gathered from end to end so that I was not a serious case and also allows			
to uh go two words go and prepare because the gap between			
dinner and the breakfast is to be very long 			
So the whole thing is that uh you should control the quantity			
of calories that you take rather than uh actual items 			
So this is under control but I think over the years I have 			
developed all kinds of psychological hangups and fears 			
And this anxiety thing for adra adrenil or something you			
know			
Yeah			
Is discharge of its own 			
And once or twice I had to cancel my air journey 			
And uh once it so happened you know that kind of fun as you might			
have to go to this university to pick up the one or two words 			
And I said you know I am going to take an early morning flight to			
Madras and then from Madras I have to take a plane to Tirichinapally and 			
I don't want to do all these and you know this builds up high			
 raised height of anxiety and the second that I start booming 			
and panting and all that 			
My son became nervous and around ten pm there came a phone			
call saying Are you travelling to Madras tomorrow 			
In those days the airlines people were a some kind of go slow or			
non-coperation thing 			
They said the flight is likely to be uh delayed indefinitely			
I see			
I said Can I cancel it 			
He said Yes 			
I said Do I have to pay any charge 			
He said no 			
And immedietly immedietly this thing was over 			
This is			
All my anxiety was over 			
 			
 Ah 			
 Laughs 			
Uhn doctor I think that you should consult a psychiatrist 			
 uhm but in my own way I will say that psychiatrists create more			
problems than solution			
 Uhm 			
I know			
More solution			
So I said that you try to reason out within yourself that 			
 yeah after all why should you have this 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
 It's getting a little psychological also			
Is it psychological uh and uh like uh 			
last month I was told that I had to go to Japan			
 Uh 			
Uhm			
 It's a rare opportunity and uh I was an invitee			
of Japan government			
I my passport has expired 			
I had to get a visa and all that 			
So in my you know uh waist on the right hand side I			
developed some pain laughter 			
And uh I thought it was my being kidney thing because diabetics			
are likely to get uh kidney and I had no time to go the			
hospital because I had to go to the passport office			
And I noticed that on fourteenth of this June when the			
passport was handed over to me at six pm that pain dis dis 			
disappeared immedietly			
 Uh 			
Uhm uh			
But you go went to Japan then			
Ah I went to you know because you know I got executive class			
ticket uh Madras uh Hyderabad Madras Madras Singapore Singapore uh Tokyo			
and then back to Singapore I made a stop over in Singapore 			
In uh Tokyo myself and Nihalani presented they told me deputy			
chairperson			
So I presided most of the sessions uh 			
For two weeks and my contribution was valued and all that 			
So I really enjoyed it			
But this anxiety thing occur occasionaly there also			
 Uh 			
Uhn			
Yes 			
I see 			
I was working there in one project yeah for one			
year 			
 Yeah 			
With whom that uh 			
Uh Dr Lal 			
Much glad			
So do I			
Lad 			
Lal Lal 			
Lal Lal 			
Now you joined here some three years ago 			
Four 			
Four years ago 			
No three years ago three three and half years you are			
not going sir 			
Uhn probably 			
No no not like that physical 			
No physical I'm alright 			
I thought you are			
I am yet differed because of the some problems knotty			
problem 			
As a head of any institution it has to be there 			
Loudly laughs 			
As a head of any institution the problem 			
Yeah you must face yeah 			
Yeah I think that is the first requirement of that			
chair laughs 			
But anyway that way our department is quite cool and calm that			
is what we think yeah students I don't know what			
staff members feel 			
 Yeah 			
That way what you say is correct			
 Haan yeah there is not much of a politics and			
uh people are quite cool 			
Even non- teaching staff is good 			
Cooperative			
Faithful and cooperative 			
But that will become element 			
 That's always			
Prospectus element yes beside it's 			
very in their way in their own way 			
 Yes 			
Yeah 			
And they erupt some time they try to show there it will			
solve they want to show that one word in the department 			
they make sometime 			
 You've worked on Synthelysis or electrons 			
Synthelysis not analysis			
Not analysis 			
What is this sythelysis when the anyway you are going to have your			
appendix but say for a common man like Dr Shastri			
 			
Yeah for a common man yeah 			
So how do you say intellectual and what is a viva 			
in a very general term			
Yeah in general term I can uh say there is uh a layer			
called as Ionosphere in the in earth's upper atmosphere 			
You may be knowing about it			
Yeah			
If you are uh 			
I may be			
If you are studying science			
Yeah			
No no I have different side			
 			
I am in English 			
No you can			
So this uh this Ionosphere is held by ionised electrons in			
sufficient numbers so as to affect the radio waves latitude 			
They effect on the radio valency they have the effect on radio			
valency 			
Now this uh Ionosphere though it has all the ionised			
species and all 			
Now it's very nuclei ionised plasma because the 			
air density at that height where this ionosphere is present			
 			
But what I could understand is not some physics that's 			
something your your uh personal things you know like you were in Bombay			
or you were in Goa 			
Goa that way we will			
 			
That is much Indian understand laughs they are			
appreciated now rather than 			
But you see their is another side of her life			
 			
Uh ha 			
Which seems more more interesting 			
She is uh defending uh uhm rights of these uh one uh			
rights of women 			
 			
Oh rights of women 			
Or legal no no on the legal side			
 			
 That's very interesting 			
On the legal side not on so social side 			
No even on social side			
But uh			
When I was working yeah I was working with one			
organisation which had many activities of this type 			
And I have got even uh experience of working with family			
council and uh legal examiners 			
 Haan that's what it's legal			
examiner			
Legal examiner 			
Then how many cases you have handled so far 			
Uh as a social worker I have handled around eighty to			
hundred cases hundred cases			
Uhn 			
Because that legalised centre which we had we 			
we used to have a thrice a week 			
And you won't believe sir the day we had the office it was			
 fully crowded on those days since morning till evening 			
And we were so many of them some fifteen twenty people 			
We used to sit in one one corner with one one lady and with			
her family and that boys side and uh husband's side and 			
her side her father mother and everyone 			
And that chou chou chou laughs 			
I see 			
 It's really I mean when you go into that na			
 we realised that there are so many not only I'm not			
talking about women but there are so many things in our society which			
 have not yet come upto that superficial level or at the discussion level			
And so many supress things within the family they affect			
individual ways very much 			
So for example you can think of something which is			
dreadful event one case which you would call very much far			
Uh uh there was uh there was one very peculiar case uh			
in the sense that it was from the very low income group 			
They they used to stay in Bombay you know slum kind of area 			
Not fully slum but you can call it uh semi- slum kind of thing			
And that man he was the only son of that man 			
And uh he had some three or four sisters all of them they were			
unmarried 			
Unmarried in the sense they were uh of course they were 			
younger to him that is why they were unmarried he was the eldest and he			
was married 			
Uh his first marriage was broken in the sense that uh because			
of the torture from these sister-in-laws sisters-in-law			
 and from mother-in-law and from father-in-law 			
She left him and in that category I mean like low income			
group they don't go for all these uh legal processes through			
court and all 			
The breaking that is the divorce is a very simple thing 			
They just leave the person and then they go 			
Then he got married to a girl from his own relations that			
is uh his mama's daughter cousin sister			
And even then she was having a similar kind of torture 			
torture means I cannot explain you to what extent that torture was			
That girl she had to go in that uh common lavotory			
In Bombay in the slum areas there are these common toilets and			
common bathroom 			
So she had to go there 			
She used to come back window she used to call someone 			
She used to tell them that please give me some chapati			
 or some bread to eat 			
I mean it was that kind of thing they were not giving her food			
 no water no food 			
And they used to and when we had some people setting it			
We really couldn't find out what identify what is the problem			
Actually that her husband was a good man 			
The only thing is he used to drink			
He was a worker in some factory 			
He used to drink a little bit 			
He never used to hit her like nothing 			
But all this people they used to harass her 			
Then after three four sittings we realised that the problem is 			
he is the only earning source of the family 			
And all of them they had this fear that if this person if			
he has a very good relationship with his wife and if there is a sound			
relationship fam sound family life there is a possibility of			
him going and staying separate 			
Oh 			
So that was the sole reason for this torture to the 			
daughter-in-law 			
You know that's a fact 			
And then we had to			
Complex issues 			
And then we had to uhm inform her father 			
Her father was in some village 			
She didn't know the address properly			
She was illiterate 			
And then he was working with one sugar factory 			
so at the address of sugar factory so somehow we contacted			
some official to tell her husband that if this if this person working			
with you then we found out his address we used to go to him we informed him			
So then he came to Bombay we talked to him			
But these people they didn't even allow her to meet him 			
And there were so many problems and finally we rescued that			
girl because she didn't want she had the total one word 			
Uhm 			
So she was sent back to her parents 			
But one good thing in this case was the parents were ready to take			
her like 			
I see			
And yeah in certain cases they they refused they say that			
we don't 			
If she she is married she is to come out of the house and			
she has to die and she has to come out 			
That is she is not allowed to come out 			
Atleast in this case they were ready to take her 			
Fine 			
What we did anything			
And that man didn't comment anything 			
He didn't say anything 			
He had no voice 			
Though he was the earning soul he was treated or or he was			
atleast he was brought up he started earning very early at early age			
So I think he was brought up in that manner that uh you know			
 in this entire world his parents and his sisters is 			
are everything for him nothing more other relationships			
are not important 			
You work so many and uh it was really a I mean it's			
 very difficult to work continously at this branch you yourself uh			
 and then you have so many problems of your own listening to all			
things no then you disturb you get disturb like emotionally 			
mentally 			
There is one case in our department right now			
Is it 			
That that uh different case is it's not a			
bit uhm yet selfish to say			
Uhm 			
But the problem is that girl's father came 			
and got her admission under the V J N T quota 			
Which quota			
V J 			
Uhn 			
 Vimukhta Jati 			
 Haan haan yeah			
Some nomadic tribe			
Some nomadic tribe 			
And she went through the waiting list and all that 			
But according to medical level we have to categorise she got 			
Now she completed part one then part two and she gave 			
her specialisation theoritical specialisation			
Uhm uhm			
She is the only one in the batch			
Is it			
This girl sat for this			
Uhm uhm			
So I was surprised that uh record uh showing class			
student it gave uh subject of such a high a few words 			
Then uhm after that she joined 			
The classes started her father came 			
Then he talked to me one and half hours in Marathi like			
that 			
 			
Uhm 			
So that lady's father came and told me that			
uh he he is responsible for her education and uh you know there must			
be coersive data 			
And uhm uh and she must marry to a person uhn who is			
some relative 			
But who is a uh rock breaker 			
Uhm uhm 			
Not educated 			
But uh the family relationship required the man uhn the father			
 to fix that she had to marry that fellow 			
Now then uh but personally I don't know how to solve			
this problem and she stopped attending the classes now 			
Now she will get marry 			
No we don't know because she refuse she refused to			
stay in the hostel though her father is paying the money she got the			
admission in the hostel 			
She is staying with somebody in the city 			
She is uh			
And uh			
I I don't think that she will agree for this 			
She will not agree but she will not study			
My problem is how do you solve her educational problem 			
 I'm not worried about her			
 That is uh 			
As I said it will take uh sometime in the sense when she			
will uh get settled mentally			
No that's not the point 			
When you take a subject like theoritical physics the proper			
environment in the first week itself you've to study book if			
it is not so this is not something like you can wait to it's not			
history or geography 			
Uhm 			
When the same classmate same group of students are			
studying one has to study			
Uhm			
If they miss that bus it's very difficult for			
them to cope up and adjust 			
You may say that I'll settle the life after uh 			
some day			
Has she has she talked to you or uh 			
No she is not opening her mouth at all 			
She is so obstinate she comes to the classroom she is dead			
silent no sign on the face 			
Not even acknowledging presence of others 			
She is she is slight so stern and strong willed 			
So she was not like this in one word or uh have			
you have you found out any sudden changes in her behaviour 			
Definitely much more than she was last year			
Uhm last year she was quite social			
Some not quite			
But little bit 			
Little bit			
She has cut off 			
Now she is not attending classes 			
And if she doesn't attend I've to cancel her uh 			
Admission 			
But ususally what they say I have to do in the			
vacation 			
Then the government of India has given thirty percent reservation			
in this category 			
Yeah yeah that reservation is said only for the government			
services isn't it 			
Like how it is for other uh 			
No it may be implemented na say for			
admissions 			
For admissions 			
Oh			
Is it			
Uhm why not 			
Not present why thirty percent in the nomination they're			
 put so and actually for every type of uh activity for			
group 			
That is educational political administrative any kind			
of uh national activity 			
And Muncipality they are having certificates			
Yeah they have held 			
People are contesting now elections			
In Kolhapur was the first city to			
 Yeah 			
Have a both Mayor and deputy Mayor Mayor yeah that is			
Mayor came under that category 			
Women woman			
Uhm now thirty percent reservation 			
 Thirty percent reservation 			
Certain seats were reserved so certain constituency they			
were reserved for women 			
So Kolhapur is the first city in Maharashtra after this			
rule came 			
Uhm			
We had that uh election 			
So naturally Kolhapur may be Shivaji University may be			
the first university in implementing this thirty			
 			
Not fashionable to talk about uh women lib and all that			
But uh laughter 			
Women lib has nothing to do			
 			
I know obviously 			
Women lib is a problem of the West 			
Uhm 			
Here the women programmes I think they are social			
 			
Yeah they are social more then uh yeah 			
I exactly I don't know obligation 			
 			
What are you going to do after completing your Ph d 			
I will try to find out some job 			
 It's always apex Kolhapur Bombay Goa

in Goa 			
Uhn I don't want to change the state but most probably			
 I'll concentrate in Bombay and Poona 			
Have you uh taken up any place here in Kolhapur			
Uhm so after coming to Kolhapur it was told to me			
that I'm supposed to concentrate only on my work and not on

Which papers she will be appearing			
She can prepare in one month only master it 			
Well Ranju we will talk about the procedure of the con 			
 uh conduction conduct of B S R B exam 			
Yes let it be we'll talk about that 			
What idea we have uh how we are called for the ex 			
exam 			
First of all the board will uh give an advertisement in the			
paper and full information will be given in that advertisement such as			
eligibility criteria time duration and the date of conduction			
 etcetera conduct 			
Uh what are the different kinds of text that are to be test			
in the exam ?			
Uh there are four kinds of tests in the exam mainly uh test			
of English language uh English comprehens comprahensive 			
clerical aptitude numerical ability and test of reasoning 			
Uhm I will tell you about the uh test of English language			
firstly 			
In that we'll in that English language include 			
uh e du spotting the error uh completion of			
sentences rearrangement of sentences etcetera 			
Spotting the error means uh in that we have to find out an error			
 uh which one is the mistake we have to find out and uh answer it			
whether it is right or wrong 			
And in completion of the sentences uh the appropriate word			
should be selected and filled up in the blank 			
And uh rearrangement of sentences should be done accordingly			
Uh well next comes the test of reasoning in that uh 			
 three topics are 			
 In the English language 			
In the En English language you are having a passage also			
no ?			
Yes we have passage also 			
Uh amo from the passage questions will be asked and			
 uh 			
 Like 			
Like uh the passage will be given and then from that			
passage we have to write the answers and uhm they will 			
one word 			
 They will ask questions for you ?			
Yes 			
Uh questions also include the words like this synonyms and			
antonymns etcetera from the passage only they have to chose the synonymns			
and antonymns and uh write accordingly 			
Uh secondly I want to tell you about the reasoning ability 			
It includes series uh analogies and classification 			
Uh series is uh uh comparatively it is difficult from the other			
two that is analogies and classifications 			
In series uh two figures will be given such as problem figures			
and uh answer figures 			
Uh in problem figures four or five figures will be given 			
and from that we have to chose the succeeding figure from the answer			
figures 			
We have to chose the correct one 			
The questions include such as they will ask that is they			
will ask uhm uh we have to compare them accordingly 			
We have to compare them uh according to the clockwise direction			
 ante-clockwise direction whether it is the figure is uh in the			
left direction or in the right direction etcetera 			
And in analogies uh it it is also same 			
It is also same as the series 			
In analogies problem figures and answer figures will be given			
We have to compare the first two figures of the problem figure			
 and the third unit should be found out from the answer figures 			
 haan 			
And uh nextly next comes the			
classification in the in which we have we have to find the odd man out			
Okay then what the what ideas are you having about the			
clerical aptitude ?			
Uhn 			
As as far as my knowledge is concerned I know that uh four			
addresses will be given			
Yes of course uhn you are right			
 Uhn 			
Four address addresses is it is			
correct na 			
Yeah			
Four addresses will be given 			
You have to chose uh the in a problems uh problem part 			
there will be given one address you have to chose exactly the same			
address out of those five options yes you have to chose			
 na 			
And you've you have to tick off it			
 Yes 			
Tick off the right one			
Hey what is the procedure of uh answering the			
questions in uh in this exam 			
Will you tell me about that that			
 Which 			
Well the answer figure also co means in the questions			
we have five optionals for each questions			
Uhm			
Totally we'll be having two hundred questions for			
four test you know 			
One test consist consists of fifty			
questions			
And totally you'll be having two hundred questions 			
In answer paper also for two hundred questions in front of each			
uh means each answer you will be given five oval 			
And in question paper you will be given optionals no in uh			
which one is the right opt uh which one is the right one no you			
have to uh darken the oval in the answer in the answer paper 			
Uh so which one you find correct you should have you should			
darken the oval particular oval			
Uhm			
And if you want to change the answer you should			
completely erase the oval 			
Uhm 			
If you want to change otherwise no you have to completely			
erase the oval 			
You should not uh leave uh means there			
Any sign			
Yes uh because the answer papers you know they will be			
feeded under into the computers you know			
Yeah			
So they will be fully erased they should be fully			
erased off			
And you should darken a new oval 			
And if you want to uh if you do not have to you do not have			
the time to erase also you should cross the oval 			
Uh you should put a cross mark on the oval and you have to give			
the correct answer 			
Our total time duration will be given uh ninety-five 			
ninety no 			
It should be divided eq eq yes in a			
certain manner			
 Ninety-five 			
 Yes 			
Yes			
It should be divided orderly			
Of course			
First you have to solve English language and then you have to			
solve reasoning ability			
Uhm			
Then thirdly you have to solve this numerical			
ability 			
 No I think you are wrong 			
Secondly you shou you should solve the numerical ability			
Ah			
Means ma calculation should be finished off you			
know first only			
Yeah			
Because uh after after means reasoning after you try			
after reasoning uh you'll be you'll get some difficulty			
in solving the numerical ability uhm because the			
calculation sometimes will uh they will be difficult			
 Uhm 			
The time allotted will be yes uh of uh			
ninety-five minutes in that you should divide yeah four			
four the test equally yeah			
 Yes 			
 Yeah 			
 Haan 			
Means one word 			
 Yeah 			
You have to complete all the four tests means it will			
not be nice you know only one test and you should you remain two tests			
First for first attempt no candidate will face some difficulty 			
But after they'll get some uh experience they will 			
it will be easy for them			
I think you have gone through two times for a			
few words 			
 Yes you are right 			
And what ideas are you having about the descriptive paper ?			
As far as my knowledge is concerned I know I'm and			
I think uh four this essays will be given yes after this

And uh if we passes that also will be called for the interview 			
Interview well will be very interesting you know 			
Uh in interview first the 			
I know because I have faced an interview 			
Yes of course I know it 			
In that interview no formalities will be observed 			
They will be as free as our parents and brothers and sisters you			
know 			
Uh first of all they will call us inside and they'll ask			
us to take our seat 			
Uhn they one word they will ask us with whom we have			
come and all 			
And some questions will be asked uh asked on our degree			
syllabus 			
And then they will ask some general questions 			
And then they will ask about uh national leaders and all 			
But it was a very interesting interview 			
Hello Chandrakala how are you 			
Fine 			
And how are you			
You seem to be quite lethargic 			
Oh it is because uh one of our friends here invited me			
for this uh lunch you know 			
Uh I had a puran poli and perhaps it has its			
effect laughs 			
And that's why 			
Yeah 			
And I think uh that's a favourite dish or 			
if they invite any guests or anyone the these are few			
things that they serve 			
 It's puran poli or jilabi			
 or gulab jamun that			
Oh for eating they are a very tasty but uh sometimes			
no they will affects affert our health 			
Yeah that's true 			
No don't you think that uh uh about this food and food habits			
and all that's these differs differ 			
 			
Now but we are saying you are not used to puran poli			
 maybe that's why you are feeling that is very heavy and			
lethargic 			
But these food habits they differ from country to country			
Yeah			
Generation to generation state to state family even			
the individual each individual 			
 It depends it depends of on			
 one's likings and dislikings			
That is also there and it may be due to climate also			
Yeah and you are not used to all this food			
Yeah			
Maybe that's why you are feeling lethargic 			
And what else do you think about the food habits over here 			
Here usually what happens no in your area most of			
the people they will have that jowar uhm 			
for their food 			
And uh in Bangalore or Mysore they will have rice 			
as a plain food			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah that's true			
 Haan 			
In north and west all these northerners westerners 			
they prefer wheat 			
Then from the north or people who will belong to			
east for example Calcutta and all they prefer they like to have			
 rice			
Yes 			
 That's the staple diet there			
Uhm 			
But now don't you feel that uh previously it so happened			
 that those who belong to east or south east they used to prefer			
rice 			
Those who belong to north and west all mostly they prefer wheat			
But now people are coming from all walks of life from all states of			
life due to studies maybe or you can say for their business			
 or service 			
And now all are familiar with all types of food			
Yeah they are 			
And gradually they will be accustomed to that kind of food 			
When one will begin to live in that particular area 			
 automatically they will be accustomed to that 			
 Yeah 			
But one difference what I find is that in this generation			
maybe it is the influence of the T V as the mass media 			
This young generation the young persons they are so used to			
this or may be they don't have so much time at their disposal now 			
they want readymade food so they go for junk food			
 Haan 			
Oh readymade			
The fast food			
 Haan 			
The canned food all that don't you think so 			
Yes it is there but uh directly they will be affected by			
 Haan that's there			
The other one			
As we Indians feel that they are three types isn't it			
 Haan 			
 Satvik rajsik and tamsik 			
Uhm but uh			
And what we feel that satvik food that is			
the best			
Ah see here no in uh Karmungra there is one word 			
Yeah 			
And uh that uh the one word has given the			
opinions about uh the persons uh above eighty years old			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh really if we read it no uh I feel that vegetarian			
food and uh that satvik what you called 			
satvik food no that will be very good to health			
 That's 			
And this is the secret of their health uh in the			
 opinion of many persons like that			
 Ah ha 			
Yeah actually as a matter of fact we should say that			
 some people eat to live some live to eat laughs no even we			
go for that 			
Then as a matter of fact uh what I feel is that sprouted			
 or fibrous nutrious salad and fresh food is a must for good			
health 			
What I feel is that food and food habit do affect our mind			
 thought			
Yeah 			
Actions 			
Uh			
Our physique everything 			
Because just see when we eat uh this person have said 			
who eat very hot or spicy food			
Uhn they will be short tempered very one word 			
Uhn they depend one word in sense yeah			
 There is an assumption 			
And what I feel the food that we eat that affects our			
physique also 			
Because uh one can get if you eat very hot this all this			
fried things and all one is you put on weight			
 Haan 			
Another thing the cholestrol level also goes up 			
So there is possibility of heart attack one word 			
Then those who have blood pressures and gasterol			
Uhm 			
Eat less of uh sugar uh sorry salt those who are			
diabetes they are told to eat less sugar 			
So all these people they are so habituated it's very			
difficult but uh 			
But what I feel no uh we people will begin to think up			
all these effects only when uh we will be suffering from 			
some disease and all but uh			
 Suffering yeah 			
But prevention is better than cure			
Yeah that is there but uh most of the people no they			
will eat what they like even it is not good for health			
Uhm uhm			
They will not care about the			
Least bothered about			
But when doctor suggested something then will go on 			
taking some precaution precautions 			
Actually			
As a matter of fact the best thing is to have a balanced			
diet laughs 			
And what I feel is again about food habit like this 			
talking food food habits enough			
Yeah laughs still though 			
What you feel I'm used to all types of food 			
But still there is a difference one word food of diferent			
states 			
For example if you go to Calcutta 			
Now in Calcutta what you find the accent the intonation the			
articulation the food the food habits it's something quite			
differnt from south 			
There what you find is instead of saying Amar they'll			
 say Amor 			
Instead of saying wa they say ba			
For example for Shivani they will Shibani 			
Ravindranath they will say Rabindranath like that 			
About the eating habit also they prefer the cheese			
Uhn			
Cheese fish all that flavour 			
Then for Rajasthan again I would like to tell that 			
as I belong to Bikaner I would like to say that there we			
don't have fresh vegetables and one word 			
So mostly we used to have that samari churmur daal			
batti gatta papad all these things ghee bhat			
 a few words 			
Which food 			
 One word I think I presume you are coming			
from Karnatak			
Yeah 			
Let us know something 			
Uh you know in Karnataka no usually people will			
prefer that roti what we'll call roti			
 it's prepared of jowar and 			
chapati rarely once in a week they will do it 			
Then rice curry			
Uhm uhm			
And they prefer more buttermilk milk ghee			
 not so much butter but they like ghee 			
Uhm			
In hot rice they like it 			
Uh 			
In uh Mysore no they will prefer idli dosa			
 then rice			
Uhm 			
Perhaps they can live months together without bread 			
but we people here no uhm in Belgaum district one of two			
words we can't live without bread 			
 Uhm 			
I must confess though I don't belong to south but still I too			
am fond of idli dosa laughs 			
I must say it's very uh it is easy easy to digest			
these things 			
Then what we have in one word and eat something else for			
food 			
But I feel that uh ro roti 			
prepared out of jowar no and rice it is better than			
 idli and dosa a day 			
It will be it will be affecting our health			
I feel irrespective of all these things some one word			
 is there 			
Whatever we eat whatever the food or food habits are we			
should try to develop such habits			
Uh for example what they are 			
The fresh 			
Uhn			
Ones a balanced diet and extra good one salad one			
word 			
It should be nutrious			
Whatever it is 			
But don't you think that uh our ances our own			
people no our elders uh they used to use turmeric or spices			
Uhn			
But uh even for using spices there must be some reason			
It it had na that it has did have two			
words besides having some taste it did add to the taste and colour			
of the food 			
But it had medicinal medicinal powers also 			
For example turmeric			
Uhm			
A very good anticeptic or asofoetida that also helps			
to have stomach one word 			
Then garlic 			
 Haan garlic is there these things too			
But the colours that we uh we use in uh preparations			
no it is very injurious to health			
But inspite of all that we use it 			
Uhn permitted colours laughs 			
Yeah one word so they are 			
And I think whatever the food that we eat it depends			
on the like the place where we're staying 			
The state also where it all these things grow 			
Wherever paddy grows obviously people will have yeah			
 no 			
 Yeah 			
Then about the timings also I would like to say 			
about these habits like in every family what you find is they have a			
different schedule 			
 Uhn 			
Obviously 			
So it's better you know in evening one word			
 if you eat early 			
In the morning also you should try to eat earlier in the night			
also if you eat and whatever you eat at night that should be quite			
light			
Uhn 			
Not very heavy 			
Now many people they are used to accustomed to eat very heavy			
food at night 			
That also affects the digestion 			
 It's better to have light food at night and uh 			
everyday in the morning that's very important			
Yes sound health is essential to have sound mind no			
Uhm 			
Then after all what are your food habits firstly			
By the way doing a lecture in a two words the			
college timing laughs 			
In the morning I go just with glass of milk 			
uhn or even a bit of bournvita and snacks or so 			
And what we have is tikla prepared of 			
wheat 			
As a matter of fact a sort of biscuit but it's			
 shallow fried 			
Then I I come at eleven O'clock that depends on			
the classes laughs 			
When I return I have my lunch 			
Now lunch comprises of what our habit is or you know say a			
personal one word in our family 			
We have rice daal chapati curry 			
little bit of one word one word all this a few			
words and all 			
 Uhn 			
Oh god 			
Pickles sometimes that one word laughs 			
though especially I shouldn't eat 			
Uhm then again in the evening we have tea or coffee one			
word 			
Then at night also we have a light uh dinner same as			
lunch 			
And another thing that people avoid is it's very 			
it's said that an apple a day keeps the doctor away laughter			
 			
But what we do many times instead of taking an apple we if			
we tell our children uhn they are ready to have cadbury 			
which spoils their teeth also uhn and not for food but 			
fruit should be one of the most important uh the important uh			
food instead of one word that is what I feel			
Everyone everyday in any form may be juice or 			
cutted cut pieces or best thing is to take apple			
 as it is without cutting it			
That is what and fruits also you have in different place			
 different fruits that you have 			
But instead of that many people they try instead of milk			
they would like to have ice-cream laughter 			
But you see they don't feel what the effects after effects			
or adverse effects they they have 			
So what do you think what are the fruits that are grown two			
words 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
We have banana uhm and I I like it very much			
Daily I use the 			
 Uhm 			
Another thing what I found find is there are few			
things which are common whether you go to east west north south 			
And one word for you all use dal			
 of course pulses cereals everybody uses curry everybody uses 			
Vegetable salad everybody uses 			
Then in some form or the other milk is used and this food 			
curd either they put curd or buttermilk at the end 			
So I think that also helps in digestion 			
 That's a good habit 			
What do you think 			
Yes that is true 			
I too use milk in our area also people prefer buttermilk 			
more than milk			
Uhm			
I mean the curd and as I told you ghee 			
but it should not be used too much but inspite of that uh it is one's			
 liking they will use it laughs 			
And as far as myself I will have cup of tea in the morning			
Uhm			
Then at nine thirty I will have some light tiffin at one			
 O'clock uhm I'll have my lunch 			
And usually I prefer green vegetables bread then			
buttermilk 			
Then in the evening rice only 			
 Uhm 			
 One word 			
Uhn in the in the evening that is at uh in the evening			
so after eight thirty or nine 			
Everyday I will have rice then curry then uh 			
 one word when I go to sleep I will have a glass of milk 			
laughs 			
What I what I think is that these food habits should be			
developed from the time when the children are very young			
Then one word all the people in the house should be			
 one word it 			
Instead of getting them biscuits or chocolates or juice			
 we should try to give them fruits one word or uh 			
vegetable salad 			
So if we develop that taste from the very beginning obviously			
 they will continue through out their life			
And they can have good health physical health			
But but now a days what is happening no children 			
even children are found of parag two words and all			
these things one word really it will spoil their health 			
And inspite of that the child as soon as it gets up from			
the bed no it uh demands for tea only			
Yeah			
And we can leave without food but uh first we			
must have a tea			
So I really feel it will kill our hunger 			
Ahn that's true 			
And in the morning also one thing is that that's uh			
 children they have that habit of taking something 			
But before that without brushing and all then they go laughter			
 and if uh they eat anything that is sweet 			
Ah			
As I told a few words anything 			
So after that atleast once they get up and before			
going to sleep one should brush the teeth atleast			
Yeah 			
So you are doing this work no the project 			
 Haan I'm what I'm			
 doing is he has collected some cassettes and uh how you how			
the English is spoken in different uh like how do you speak English			
in classrooms colleges uhm and how do you uh while			
conversation while conversing how do you talk and all 			
So he has recorded all those in that uhm all			
those in the cassettes 			
And I have to input them just 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Only just typing work you printed out over there			
 Yeah one word 			
Just typing work I have to do 			
Not writing the program and all and execution execution			
 It's not like that laughs 			
But uh this these languages what I'm learning 			
na they are completely different completely different from what			
 I'm what the work he is doing like 			
Why I asked you is because I wanted to know how you can			
use those languages			
 Haan haan 			
Like 			
No you can use them 			
Uh like it is not be like our courses like if you			
do and all those 			
Uhm			
Like we work whatever theory we learnt uhm			
 that is actually totally not applicable			
 Uhm 			
Ahn ha 			
Uh in practice			
Practice yeah 			
You know like what are the metric system 			
 one word on paper			
 One word 			
 Haan haan 			
Ahn 			
Actually it is uh in practice we use the uh foot and			
pound or those F P S system			
Uhm uhm			
All those			
Yeah yeah 			
So you have to convert all those in the metric system 			
 Yeah everything is done in one word 			
and one word and all those things 			
So what are you doing is very			
Conversion it becomes difficult like			
 Difficult 			
Difficult in the sense you can't be uh if I say			
this room is three metre uh if any then I can't just			
immedietly convert it like			
Yeah 			
Or if anyone asks uh what is size of this say this big big			
column			
Uhm 			
So I can I can be able to I would be able to 			
tell him uh metric system 			
 Metric system 			
That will become difficult and common people they 			
don't understand			
You have to take paper yeah and sit			
 Yeah 			
So like that I thought in in practice it will be like			
Theory and practice			
But it's completely different 			
Now suppose if I go like I have completed my D C M			
Yeah 			
If I go as a programmer and all what I have to do so			
that I'll I probably may not be knowing			
Yeah			
I thought that way 			
Yeah 			
You have to learn from someone what is to be done and then			
you have to do that according to it at least you are a one word 			
 I thought like that			
No no 			
 One word 			
Then what are your what all subjects are you having 			
Uh I'll tell you later uhn 			
Uhm			
Because I don't have have that			
syllabus right now 			
 What do you mean 			
Like uh what are your subjects you learnt in civil 			
In civil			
Yeah 			
In civil uh construction management construction and			
uh that irrigation and hydro-electrician 			
 One word in diploma one word 			
Then that environmental engineering			
Uhm uhm			
And applied electronics all those uh designing of sectors			
 theory of sector like that all those 			
Now again now a days actually you know in America and all 			
everything is done on uh by machine			
Uhm uhm			
Only in India there is manual work			
Yeah laughs 			
So now now a days most of job one see is it			
requires uh this like uh amp ample of plenty of 			
time 			
 Time yeah 			
It consumes and if you want to do some changes again you			
have to consume a lot of time over there			
Yeah 			
So on computer it becomes easy uh like I have seen one			
paper two words you know this uh we had the programme of the			
design of uh Taj Mahal and so we got it making changes according			
to one word his point of view			
Yeah 			
There is one knob and you just fix on uh moving it			
Uhm uhm 			
And it goes on changing 			
Uhm uhm			
So that give me the inspiration like 			
Uhm uhm			
I could do all that			
Uhm uhm			
Like 			
You are doing it on the computer			
Yeah graphics			
Graphics			
Yeah all graphics and uh 			
So how to like interior also you can do now this so			
that will be the next step			
Yeah			
Like because this knowledge now now a days what 			
I'm learn learn what we are learning it is twenty years old			
Yeah 			
This is twenty years old out of India yeah 			
outside India			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
So now you want to yeah use it like			
 Yeah 			
We should no some advance technique computers and some			
Yeah			
So that and apply it accordingly			
Yeah			
 That's why I'm uh I want to learn			
Yeah 			
 That's why I was telling these problems are one			
word admission over there one word 			
So now it's quite difficult 			
Yeah it will it should be like and according to my			
point of view I don't know how far it will be applicable 			
but it should be 			
Yeah 			
Like once you are intro introduced to that			
system so it becomes easy for you to grasp			
Yeah			
Like you know you have to one word and all those			
things			
Uhm 			
You know this was there is uh little bit of uh			
computers			
Uhm 			
Like just a basic knowledge and uh some small			
programmes and all like to design structures road traffic and all 			
you know			
I don't know any thing about these one word 			
 Two words 			
Uhn that only manual just theoritically 			
 one word I know but uh regarding deep knowledge I am			
not having about it			
 One word 			
So flat now whatever flat designing and all actually			
if you start uh calculating the designs structural			
design of the building uhm then it becomes like uh taking			
all the loads and all accurately			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
It becomes very difficult			
 Two words 			
And also it takes long time			
Long time 			
So with on on computer it will be able to			
computerise 			
 You're able to computerise 			
Computerise everthing now 			
Yeah			
What you all have done in Diploma one word 			
 It's good simultaneously doing B E in civil			
Like it's useless just doing going on doing the same			
yeah			
Yeah			
If you do something			
Yeah 			
What all a few words 			
Now when af after completing my B E I 			
shouldn't feel that I should have done computer 			
Now everything has been computerised			
Yeah 			
So I'm lagging I shouldn't feel			
that I'm lagging behind like 			
 Lagging behind yeah 			
I should immedietly get a job			
Or I yeah should I should immedietly start my own			
because actually see now in uh say in civil actually girls are 			
very few like			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Hardly now this year I I think so I'll be the only			
girl in my class			
My God laughs 			
Yeah like that 			
And uh usually there are no girls in this field			
So now again after completing my B E if I if I work as site			
engineer it will be difficult			
Uhm			
So this year also I saw after my diploma also many of			
the guys like my classmates they got job			
Uhm uhm			
But I it was difficult for me because la 			
they don't prefer ladies like site engineers and all those things			
Yeah			
And designing then they want all those uh uh this uh			
technical students because they can uh use them for just uh few 			
like uh pay			
Yeah			
Ahn two hundred three hundred four hundred rupees			
Uhn uhn 			
So that is for for diploma engineer you yeah			
 need something na 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Just can't work on atleast you for			
experience you can work without taking any 			
Uhm uhm			
Uhn salary or something			
Uhm uhm 			
But uh you can't just go and yeah 			
and say I'll I'll work uh for a hundred rupees			
 Yeah 			
Uhm uhm			
Or two hundred rupees that two words			
 no			
Yeah 			
So that is two words actually 			
And even I've seen I have seen many of my friends my			
classmates			
Only in my class there were eight girls			
Uhm uhm 			
Uh whole year for diploma 			
Now they are working here for just some two fifty four hundred			
five hundred two words 			
You are working here 			
Yeah in Kolhapur 			
In Kolhapur 			
Now actually my uh some of my friends they have 			
their own firm 			
So whenever they need me they call me			
Uhm uhm 			
And they ask me to come for designing and all			
Even from for letter drafting like			
we have some mutual relations like			
Uhm			
Homely relation family relation like 			
So I I do their work but I don't take anything 			
If at all one word my some some uh min			
 minor expenses and all			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Like petrol and all			
Sometimes they give like			
Uhn 			
Means like if they take my bike laughs 			
Uhn uhn 			
They put the petrol and give one word and like			
that			
Uh like uh 			
 All the maintenance work and all they do			
Uhm			
Like for a bike or whatever it is			
Uhm			
So I don't get a salary as such because and that			
too uh their job is like they are out of uh like			
Out field 			
Uh they don't they don't have a office			
or anything like that			
This is where you gain experience na 			
Yeah			
Well and good			
 I'll be whenever they need me they call me			
Uhn 			
 I'll go to their house			
Uhm			
Then they tell me whatever even from for			
 letter drafting			
Yours is like 			
Yeah ours is like 			
 One word clearly discuss one word and we do 			
But I don't like a working like like a job			
and like a boss and uh this thing employee			
Yeah 			
I don't like that relation like			
Uhm 			
So it becomes difficult na 			
There should be a friendly relationship between			
 Yeah 			
Yeah friendly relation 			
So those uh they have their own firm like not a 			
one word not a full fledged firm 			
It is not a full fledged firm			
Uhm 			
So but just if you say this it is just the			
beginning			
Yeah 			
So we just helping them 			
So sometimes I go over there			
Uhm uhm 			
So say for six months I have been assisting them			
Uhm 			
So now atleast whenever they and their main job			
 one word they do many one word like they have many this one			
what you call distributorship and one word agencies 			
and all 			
So they have to go out			
 Uhn ha 			
Uhm uhm			
In the morning and in the afternoon and all if at all any			
 if uh even if they have to draft any a single letter for any company and			
all they ask me			
Uhm 			
In English it has to be done and everything English			
 In English yeah 			
So my English writing is better uhm than			
what I talk			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
Then that's why they call			
No you talk well laughter 			
And over here since we uh after my college uh school 			
 uhm after uh tenth			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
So ever since uh my since eighty-nine I have not			
spoken I have not spoken English or Kannada to anyone			
Why			
With anyone here 			
Why why			
Like in the class in my college like uh it is			
some what odd			
Yeah 			
Or people think uh talking in English is somewhat 			
Yeah showing off			
Yeah showing off laughs 			
So that accent is losing uhn here			
You lose 			
Yeah 			
 Two words 			
When you have uh some when you learnt any language or			
something you should have a mastery if you are in contact with it			
 if you are in touch with it then you'll have the			
mastery or hold or you get an accent or like that			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah yeah yeah 			
Yeah 			
Right from the one word school days itself			
Now see 			
 One word six years have passed			
Uhm yeah I think yeah six years have passed 			
So over here everything			
You are an English medium student I think			
Yeah English medium			
Then you should be in touch with English language			
Yeah but over here they literally no one speaks in			
English			
Yeah 			
Everyone speaks 			
 One word pure Marathi 			
Generally every time			
Even Kannada I'm literally I am forgetting			
everything laughs 			
And I actually it's becoming difficult for me to read			
Yeah 			
Because I have I have never read anything since after my			
You learnt it Kannada language 			
 Yeah 			
I had a subject no one word two words			
 			
 Two words 			
From eighth 			
From eighth yeah 			
Some fifty marks uh something like that 			
Third language 			
I scored thirty-three in it out of fifty 			
I am Mr B N Patil teaching at the Balasaheb desai college			
 Patan 			
I am Mr A Y Shinde uh I'm lecturer in English			
Department of college Patan Satara district 			
Well Mr Shinde uh nowadays we give importance to 			
marriage 			
What are your feelings about wedding 			
What do you say about 			
About marriages marriages can be of two types 			
One is uh arranged marriage and another is uh uh love			
marriage you can say 			
So modern one modern version 			
And the previous uh uh in uh bygone days it was the			
arranged marriage 			
Okay you 			
Uh these days people prefer the love marriage or the 			
uhm uh other types of marriage where the expenses will be minimum 			
But middle class that the people particularly in			
Satara Sangli or Kolhapur district mostly they demand dowry 			
Is this so uh is it uh a fact or it's only			
Yes it is a fact 			
But uh it depends upon the girl 			
If uh the girl is not very beautiful uh then they expect more			
money			
They ask for the dowry 			
And so if the boy and girl are of uh equal status 			
if uh both of them are uh uhm uh they like each other then 			
there is no question of dowry as such 			
But if there is no question of dowry then why is that the			
people go on demanding more and more from all the people all of us			
Will you uh in particularly ah if you are from a			
Marathi community okay 			
Will you tell me something about the community that too			
 on the dowry 			
 Ah 			
 Community 			
I know I am from Maratha community 			
I am from uh Sangli district 			
Uh this here the people have got into the vicious circle 			
 uhm in the sense that uh this uh they give them dowry to			
their daughters uh while marrying them 			
And later on when their boy becomes of a marriagable age that			
time they want the return 			
And so they demand uh the dowry 			
So that is the problem			
 Uhm 			
Is it because of the social conditions 			
No			
Yes something else 			
Yes 			
What is it then 			
Uh 			
Well why is that the dowry system has become important			
nowadays 			
Uh one thing is that suppose that girl uh girl's			
 father or the parents are rich uhm uh and they			
want their daughter to be uh settled in uhm uh or sent			
to another uh rich family uhm 			
Then they don't bother about the money			
 They are ready to they are ready to give the dowry			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 But 			
Nowadays it has a become a problem			
The dowry has become a problem one word 			
Yeah 			
Why why because even the educated people uhm			
 go on demanding they need Fridge they need Scooter			
Sometimes they demand uhm car or what they			
call the Television set and all these things			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
Yes			
Okay what is the use of the education then 			
No that way the uh uh there is no self examination or			
introspection as such 			
Uh most of the people are tradition bound uh and because of			
that they go on uh uh accepting the dowry 			
Well is it the dowry are we going to be are we going to			
 get everything what you want 			
Yes uhm they ask for money and they ask for the			
 No it is well it is said uhm 			
uhm that nature has everything for man's need 			
 uhm 			
But there is nothing for man's greed 			
What do you say about it 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Yes there is I agree with you 			
Because there is no limit to the greed of the man 			
And uh if another party can afford to give then the			
another party goes on asking for for more and more money and uh the			
and something in the form of articles and things			
Well there are some people who act as mediator			
Yeah they are called match-makers			
They are called the match-makers			
Match-makers			
Well what are what are your impressions about these			
match-maker			
How they work uhn what they do exactly 			
 Uhn 			
 It is very uh interesting role they they			
function 			
Uh uh they knows know both the			
parties			
Uhm			
And uhm most of the time this match-makers they are			
relatives of the uh one of the parties			
Uhm 			
Or sometimes they know the both the families			
Uhm			
And they take it to be a uh good work			
Uhm			
It uh you can say it a social work uhm 			
or community work uhm 			
They want to help in one form or another form uhm			
 and uh this marriage uhm uh uhm uh it's			
 a tie the holy tie uhm and they want uh that			
both the parties should come together			
 Uhn 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
And if uh it becomes fruitful uhm they uhm			
 uh they themself themselves become very happy			
And that is why uh sometime sometimes 			
 they spent the money on their own			
 Uhm 			
Ah			
And see to it that both the parties come together 			
uhm and uh they get married			
The boy and the girl uh get married 			
 Uhm 			
So in ancient times we have heard of some people			
or wo women chosing their husbands			
Yes			
What is they call the swayamwara 			
Uhm			
Okay it differs from yeah this marriage			
that is a marriage system uhm means she had the right			
 to chose her husband			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
 Haan 			
That is according to her wish			
What do you say about it 			
As if swayamvaras nowadays or the people			
are simply making their daughters obey the orders 			
 Haan these days uh uhm the daughters			
don't depend mostly upon the uhm parents 			
They have also some some say in the matter 			
That if uh if the daughter doesn't like the boy uh her			
would- be husband then she uhm tells the parents that uh she			
doesn't approve of that boy 			
Hence uh she tells or she is free enough to tell 			
the her parents 			
Well is it going to be the marriage of uh two minds 			
or is it going to be the marriage of the economic status of the two families			
Well in arranged marriages it is not the marriage of two			
minds yeah 			
Wherever there is uh love marriage it is a			
marriage of two minds 			
 Yeah 			
 Uh 			
Well it's plenty out there that 			
love doesn't cause the way or they can one word 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Well but now at least we find people changing their minds			
Yeah			
Taking divorces and uh marrying remarrying again			
 taking divorces			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
Why is it so 			
What has happened 			
What has changed the whole society or a few words 			
Uh previously uh they thought that the marriages are			
made in heaven			
Uhm			
And uh uh they have to continue this sacred tie 			
They have to remain husband and uh wife till the end 			
But uh so far God has been uh uh driven away from this world			
 nobody uh uhm nobody is afraid of God or nobody believes in			
religion as such 			
And so they think that uh if that marriage uh doesn't make			
them happy then they uhm they take divorce or they behave 			
according to their own will 			
Well is their life going to be happy in the end or 			
 Afterwards 			
 What what what are your observations one			
word 			
The people those who have taken divorce you see them one			
word living uh isolated life or 			
 Nai see if a few words			
 unsuccessful marriage			
Unsuccess marriage yes 			
Uh in if the husband and wife they are not happy then			
 it's better to quit and look uh for another partner 			
uhm if they think that uh they will become happy 			
Otherwise uh it will affect their children 			
 Uhm 			
So perhaps if they go away from each other 			
yeah and live uhm uhm independent lives so what's going			
to happen to their children 			
 Yeah 			
Now that is the question 			
Sometimes uh uhm the court if the if the matter goes to			
the court the court can uh uh come to the help of the children			
When the uhm children are below seven years then they			
are uh kept with the mother 			
And after that it's the duty of the uhm father			
He is free to uh take the responsibility of the 			
child 			
 So what the tie means is the love 			
not the property			
 Yes 			
Up to			
What we have call the materialistic			
Yeah			
 It's not the material uhm topic 			
 Uhm 			
What is to be done about that one 			
You see that is why the court insisted that uh upto the			
age of seven uhm the child is allowed to be kept with the			
mother			
And after that uh uhm the father can claim the the			
children 			
Because it is uh his responsibility			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
And he is also able to uh bring them up properly or help			
them in a materialistic uh one word 			
 Well it's so i i if they have			
the law of the land is that we can take divorce			
So we can live uh independently also that's			
 true 			
But is it not the duty of the husband to take proper care of			
the girl			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
Uhm because it is the faith of the father 			
that his daughter will be safe yeah in the hands of this			
particular person 			
But it is not observed nowadays 			
Why so 			
 Yeah 			
Sir the reason is that uh the father sometimes he is			
unemployed			
Uh			
And uhm he has no time and uh he cannot take			
uh the proper care of the girl 			
And so he has to keep her in the hostel or some uh some other			
place or with some relatives 			
And the the daughter cannot become happy			
No no that's not my question you see 			
one word if one word his daughter marries a particular			
person			
 One word 			
Ah ha I see			
He thinks that he is a right person uhm who			
will take care of my daughter			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
But his dreams are shattered			
Yes shattered by			
What does he dream Whether daughters or father			
dream			
 Uh 			
 Haan 			
The father of the			
Sir father think that uh he has made a wrong choice or			
his daughter has made a wrong choice 			
And sometimes say it it happens that the uh two family			
 uh backgrounds they don't match 			
Or the the culture of uh both the families doesn't			
match 			
And because of that the clash uh takes place and uh both			
the parties get separated 			
For the			
They live uh unhappy sort of life 			
Well what can be done about it 			
 What's the solution 			
What do you think about it 			
Well the only thing is that uh if uh the husband and			
wife wants to be in uhm happy then they should uh cooperate each			
other 			
They should not uh uhm be selfish and uh they should			
think that it is the duty to see to that the marriage becomes			
successful 			
And they can make conducive or happy atmosphere in the family			
So that the the children they will benefit by that			
atmosphere			
How can that be achieved first they must understand each			
other			
Yeah 			
Well that's what we we say but the			
religious man those who are there yeah that their lives are			
 uh bound by sanctity or by each to each uh by bounds of			
 nature or by yeah uh uhm religious views			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Uhm 			
But nowadays it seems that the people do not trust 			
Uhm God			
God			
God			
God as well 			
Or even they do not uh believe in themselves what they are			
doing exactly 			
Means the life of the people has uh become uh sort of			
disorderly life in the sense now they themselves do not know			
what they are going to do uhm or what's going to			
 no but happen			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
 No but 			
 One word depend that her father mother 			
or the husband and wife uh need not depend upon God or religion all the			
time or tradition all the time 			
That uh they should uh uh continue their their affection 			
uh for each other 			
And so that if they love each other then there will be uh			
no trouble as such			
So it is a love that is a binding spirit 			
 Yeah binding force 			
Binding force 			
 Or it is a tie 			
It is a			
Ah ha both the parties can be united uh till the end 			
of their life 			
Okay so now it's about the Maratha families or			
what we say one word now they are married in uh in some Gujrati			
family or the Marwari family or some Jain family or some 			
one word family yeah what do you say about it 			
Hey what what are your observations 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Now as far as marriage from Maratha community are concerned			
 most of the marriages are arranged marriages 			
Arranged			
And uh they i it is uhm long process or long			
business you can say			
Uhm 			
Because uh first of all the match-maker 			
plays a very vital role very important role			
 Uhm 			
Well 			
And he sees to it that both the parties come together			
Uhm 			
And uh there the the girl's father 			
 uhm pays a visit to that uh boy's house 			
And uh he talks about the marriage 			
He gives the invitation you can say			
 Uhn 			
Okay 			
Uh to come to his house uh and see the girl 			
one word and that ceremony of showing the girl uhm 			
takes place 			
And uhm that boy also comes uh and before that uhm			
everything is discussed 			
And if the boy and uh parents of the boy likes the girl			
 then they uh show the green signal 			
And uh later on then uh a a formal ceremony takes			
place			
It is called engagement uh that ceremony			
is called engagement 			
 One word 			
 Uhm 			
Well now you talked about this match-maker it's true			
then whether th match-maker particularly intents to uhm 			
uh contact two families which are 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah he knows the fam uh both the			
parties

Lecturer 			
Means lecturer and so you completed this course			
Yeah 			
Mine is a different case 			
Why ?			
I never wanted to do any kind of job 			
But why ?			
No that was my thinking earlier before say ten to twelve			
years I was thinking in this way 			
Not to do any kind of job to just to run a home to be a			
housewife only 			
Uhm 			
To do all the things and have cook the food			
clean the house pots clothes etcetera 			
But later on somehow uhm my thinking changed			
and I continued my study until I passed my M A I was not thinking of			
becoming a lecturer 			
 But how do you 			
 Uhm 			
 It's not my case 			
After graduation I was thinking 			
 It's only that to become a lecturer 			
 Accidently that I became a lecturer 			
No one was hoping about me 			
No one hoped actually			
It means			
My relatives			
Our uh cases are totally different 			
Totally different two poles apart 			
 One word 			
So what happened to me is that upto M A this job			
is I'm doing this job accidently only 			
It was an accident I became to be a lecturer and I am			
continiung 			
 Where are you working ?			
I am working in Willingdon College Sangli 			
Uhm 			
At present I am teaching the P G classes as well as the U			
G classes			
Uhm I am only teaching the U G classes 			
So it's a kind of Marathi influence on me			
So you had uh how did you begin your education where			
Oh mine I told you my village is very small and we had			
education only upto fourth standard 			
So then after fourth standard when I was nine years so I had to			
go to a nearby town Taluka place			
Uhm uhm 			
So three miles that is about five kilometres everyday			
we used to walk in the morning and return back in the evening like 			
that 			
And sometimes so we were nearly twenty persons uh uh 			
fifth standard sixth standard seventh standard eighth standard like that 			
So all of us together we we were going to take a room 			
 uhm and uh on rental basis stay there			
And turn wise everday some persons were coming back to village			
and collecting our tiffin and bringing there 			
So that kind of living			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
So it was of course sort of cooperative			
Oh yeah yeah laughter 			
Living together 			
No it is very funny so it enlightened my life			
 in the primary and uh high school 			
So uh I I cannot forget it			
So 			
 And after that 			
After finishing your secondary education 			
Uhm uh after secondary education the college was uh			
available only in Bagalkot			
Uhm			
So that was about thirty miles away from my place			
Uhm			
So naturally I had to go to Bagalkot 			
And another place was Dharwar 			
So Dharwar was bit away so I had to go to I did my			
this uh			
 So you did it in Bagalkot 			
And where did you stay in Bagalkot			
Bagalkot uh in the beginning uh you know I I had			
felt home sickness			
Uhm 			
So only because of for the first time I left my family and			
all that 			
So in fact I didn't want to continue my college and I wanted to			
go back 			
And I went back to my village 			
And then my father was so much interested in education though			
he was uneducated 			
And he wanted me to educate 			
And uhm I was okay and I was considered to be somewhat			
intelligent and as well as and uh so my mother actually came with me			
 and for one year she stayed with me			
She stayed with you yeah			
And that's how then uh so after one year			
passed you know afterwards I became acquainted with with the			
 Became 			
Got accustomed to living in Bagalkot			
 Accustomed 			
Then then I started staying in some hostel and some 			
pri private apartments like that 			
Okay 			
And how many brothers and sisters you have			
Uh I have that uh two brothers 			
So including me we are three 			
And uh two sisters 			
So I'm the youngest I am the youngest one			
 Youngest 			
Uhm			
And uh my eldest brother is uh taking care of this uh uh			
uh 			
Agriculture 			
Yeah 			
And basically we are agriculturists 			
And my middle brother he was a school master 			
And very recently he retired as a head master of a primary			
school			
Uhm 			
And my two sisters they are married to some uh village			
people and they are alright after all 			
Did you do your M Sc also from Bagalkot			
No there M Sc cannot uh we in Karnataka you know 			
the P G is only at the university centre			
Uhm 			
So I had to go to Dharwar for M Sc 			
There also you stayed in the hostel 			
Yeah I stayed uh in the hostel			
And immedietly after your M Sc you took up teaching			
 Yeah I uh in while doing M Sc so			
there was uh uhm a special provision for some of the students they			
used to give uh uhm uhm a a piece of research work 			
Uh that minor research we used to call 			
So in the second year of M Sc I was given a piece of research			
work and I was assigned to one Professor Dr Rajgopal			
Uhm 			
And uh so I worked with him for minor research 			
And uh in that year I came in very close contact with Dr			
Rajgopal so I promised him to continue Ph D with him only 			
So after completing my M Sc I joined Dr Rajgopal sir for Ph D 			
Do you get any scholarship for doing the Ph D 			
 Yeah I got uh C S R some two words 			
to start with 			
And after two years I got this U G C fellowship 			
And then after completing my Ph D I stayed in nineteen			
sixty-seven I got my Ph D degree 			
And I stayed there uh since I was married at the age of			
twenty-one only because my mother wanted to see me married uh			
because she was almost ailing			
Uhm			
And uh so because of that I had to set up in Dharwar 			
 otherwise otherwise I would have gone to some other place outside			
the state Poona like that 			
Uhn so after uhm after getting my Ph D in nineteen sixty-seven			
I got three fellowships one U G C senior fellowship C S R senior			
fellowship another I I T senior fellowship from Kanpur			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
I would have gone to Kanpur and made a very good career 			
but uh because of marriage I couldn't go 			
So I had to			
Stay back in Dharwar 			
 Stay in Dharwar yeah 			
And for two years I was there sixty-seven to sixty-nine as a 			
two words 			
And later on you know with great difficulty because I'm			
 coming from a agriculture background and no godfather so I			
entered the university as a demonstrator 			
And three years I was a demonstrator			
Then with great difficulty I got a Lecturer's			
 post 			
And I was sent to Gulbarga 			
And after that I had no problem			
 I'm coming up from my own laughs 			
 Lecturer 			
Yeah on your own			
Yeah 			
And how many years you have been visiting Kolhapur 			
Uh this is my third visit to Kolhapur			
And uh once I came here for examination work 			
And once uh to participate in a conference which was organised			
by the chemistry department of this university			
And now this is third time 			
Do you understand Marathi 			
A little bit 			
Because uh i i it's uh I'm from 			
the Bombay Karnataka			
Uhm			
So there are quite a number of people speaking Marathi			
And uh as I know Hindi uhm which I can speak 			
And so there are many common words in Hindi and Marathi so I			
can understand uh though I may not speak uh in Marathi			
 Uhm 			
No how did how did you learn Hindi 			
So Hindi it was compulsory for us in uh			
In the school			
Yes yes in the school			
Uhm 			
And I passed the Rashtrabhasa 			
Uhm 			
Out of my own interest			
Uhm 			
So since it's a national language I felt I			
should			
You can read Hindi 			
Oh yes sir			
Means you can read Marathi also 			
 Yes Hindi I can read Hindi also			
So Marathi and Hindi 			
Oh yes script they are the same I can read			
Marathi without any problem			
And I can understand also			
 As the one word same 			
Uhm 			
But uh speaking is a problem and uhm 			
Tell us something about Gulbarga 			
Uh Gul 			
And how big is the city 			
Gulbarga is quite big 			
And it is a divisional place			
And uh the population I think somewhere around three point			
five to four lakhs 			
And uh uhm because of this uh uhm there in that part of			
Karnataka uhm there is no other big city			
Uhm			
And uh there are several colleges and educationally			
uhm that is a very well developed this I can say			
And there is a Medical college 			
And there are two Engineering colleges 			
And there are so many colleges 			
 Private colleges or uh government colleges			
Yeah both of them are private colleges and uh			
And the Medical college also is a private college 			
Medical college also a private college and uh Engineering			
college one of the Engineering college they started long back and it is 			
uh I think it has got grant uh this though it is a private college			
And there are several Pharmacy colleges 			
And uh Science colleges and Women's college like that			
educationally I think uh uhm 			
When when was the university in Gulbarga was established			
Yeah it started as a post graduation centre in nineteen			
seventy-one			
Of Karnataka university 			
 Karnataka yeah yeah Karnataka university 			
And initially they started uh two or three departments 			
Kannada English uh that's all			
Uhm 			
And later in this nineteen seventy-two they added uh some			
more departments Chemistry department then uh this uh Mathematics			
department were added 			
So I went in nineteen seventy-two 			
So we were uh			
So Gulbarga has been a university for the last twenty-five			
years			
No no seventy to eighty upto eighty it was part of			
Karnataka university as a post graduate centre 			
 Centre uhm 			
So only in nineteen eighty it became another university 			
along with Mangalore university 			
So Mangalore and uh Gulbarga 			
 Yeah Gulbarga are of the same age			
Were established as university in the same year			
 Yeah in the same 			
Yeah same year 			
So it's a only a fifteen years old university			
Yeah fifteen years old 			
Now do uh does the university have departments			
like uh Nuclear Physics or Computer Science yeah 			
Bio-technology			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Sir we have uhm uh almost all departments the the the			
Master of Computer uh uh I think M C A course			
Uhm			
So that is there and our Vice-chancellor since he is the			
uh person from Mathematics and Computer so he our present Vice-chancellor			
 he's invested lot of one word Computer Science and			
M C A course is there			
And we have got Bio-technology course also 			
And uh Nuclear Physics uh there is this department			
And there is a separate Applied Electronics department 			
So in Physics department I don't think they have Nuclear			
Physics 			
So they have solid state physics and one word 			
 How how big are your Physics and Chemistry			
departments 			
Chemistry is very big			
Uhm 			
So we have uh about twenty-one staff members			
Uhm			
Twenty-one staff members 			
And we are educating every years fifty students 			
We have got five branches Organic Inorganic Physical			
 and Medical and Pharmaceutical			
Uhm 			
And also for each branch we are admitting about ten students			
So in all we are admitting fifty students 			
So that's a very and first year fifty second			
fifty we have got quite a number of Ph D M Phil and P G students 			
 It's a very big department			
And what is the procedure of admission in Gulbarga			
university 			
Sir the admission procedure is uh almost uh uhm			
government type of procedure 			
Sir we strictly go by merit and uh following the one word			
 system 			
And uh we conduct the entrance examination 			
So uh university 			
 So even even students from your own university			
have to appear for the entrance examination 			
 Oh yeah definitely 			
 Definitely and uh			
 One word 			
Sir mostly you know the the seats for uhm post			
graduate seats are mainly allotted to this uh students of affiliated			
colleges			
Uhm 			
Outside the university students hardly one or two seats will			
be uh available for the year 			
 Yes 			
So most of the seats are for only affiliated college			
students 			
So uhm immedietly after their undergraduate examination B A or B			
Sc or B Com sir we conduct the entrance examination 			
And uh so we have evolved a formula			
Uhm			
About seventy-five percent weightage is given to their uh			
first class degree performence 			
And twenty-five percent weightage is given to entrance			
examination 			
So both together we uh prepare a merit list 			
 Uhm 			
 Entrance examination 			
 Merit list			
And then according to the one word system we			
allot seats 			
Is the medium of instruction at the graduate level 			
English or Kannada			
Uh as I know in the science uh there is no medium of			
Kannada in uh in almost all colleges it will be only English in the			
science			
Uhm			
And uh in Arts I think 			
In one word and Arts it is Kannada 			
 One word and Arts 			
Yeah they use Kannada 			
And uh students are allowed to write uh uhm either in Kannada			
or English			
Uhm			
And even in science also that provision is there 			
But none of the students they write in Kannada 			
 They're since they are taught in English 			
 uhm so they will answer in English			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
English 			
And how many students in all are there in your university 			
Uh I thought there			
But it is not a constituent colleges			
I am talking about the post graduate uh department			
 Oh yeah so yeah we don't have any uh			
college uh run by the university			
Uhm			
So only the uhm the P G			
Uhm			
Uh courses are run by the university 			
And I think uh that must be somewhere around fifteen hundred			
 uh students			
I don't know the exact strength			
Uhm			
But it is uh somewhere around fifteen to fifteen hundred			
to two thousand 			
So in that range			
Yeah and uh government of uh Karnataka 			
gives all the grants and the U G C also gives the grants			
Yeah so			
But beside these two funding agencies are there			
other agencies which also fund the programmes in the university			
 Yeah there is one uh this Hyderabad			
Karnatak uh uh development fund they have uhm the the Karnataka state			
in order to develop that Hyderabad karnataka area so 			
Ah like we were talking about the hostel 			
Yeah 			
Now what is the system of the hostel uh 			
System system is all corruption you see laughter 			
Better we should			
You see we say in Punjabi one word 			
 Laughs 			
Better we should not talk about the corruption 			
No what I am telling is I am staying in the hostel			
 and it's the vacation time			
 Yes yes 			
Ah ha ha			
So there is no rule to for students who stay in the hostel			
there is no time study for one word 			
Ah ha ha 			
Since I don't have any study one word so this is			
all that uh			
Yeah			
Which we say in Punjabi			
Uhm uhm 			
Somewhere then you might			
Generally like uh we have heard about uh the electricity			
usage 			
Uh we can use uh what uh this kind of uh apparatus			
 or uh we can use or not like heater 			
And some boys use it and uh some some are allowed and some			
are not allowed 			
 Appliances 			
Depends laughs uh upon his relation with the			
warden			
Yeah 			
Yeah			
Well like uh I think heater taking heater is not			
the useful now a days because uh in the bathroom they have geysers			
now a days 			
Geysers are there uh one geyser for twenty boys			
For twenty boys 			
 For twenty rooms 			
Ah ha ha 			
And uh there are twenty boys and geyser you can			
initially get two three buckets 			
And after that water is cold 			
 Water is cold yeah			
So 			
 That's the problem			
More than we get ready within time before nine			
And may be sometimes geyser is working right or			
sometime it's uh 			
 Nei it's no problem 			
Ah ha 			
Actually department is okay 			
Ah ha 			
But uh you can have two three buckets after that 			
it's all cold water 			
Right 			
That mean uh cough most of the students uh needing			
this kind of heater electric rod or something like that 			
They think their bathing is necessity not luxury 			
laughter what warden says			
Ah yes 			
So what kind of uh uh fine they put 			
Fine is according to the appliances 			
Means I was using uh heater plus rod			
Ah ha 			
Plus two tubes plus two table lamps 			
Ah ha			
And uh laughs uh one thing more stereo			
and T V			
Ah and T V			
Everything was on ah ha and I was sitting and			
reading magazine 			
 Ah ha 			
Okay lucky you have social room 			
Warden came laughter warden knocked at the door			
and I just opened the door			
Uhm 			
He said what are you doing ?			
Then he saw the 			
As a kind of fine they charged some amount of			
money			
 Fined he 			
He fined me rupees five hundred but I paid			
nothing laughs 			
He must have a			
This is what I told you earlier depends			
upon the relation			
 Yeah ah 			
Uhm uhm uhm 			
So vehicle is not uh in the rule I mean you can have it not 			
scooter or motorcycle or car you can have anything 			
 These things your personal matter it's 			
not a hostel matter			
Right 			
I mean that like uh there is no such parking problem or			
some			
No there is a 			
Garage problem or something			
No no there is			
 One word some boys have cars with them 			
one word 			
Not uh common everybody some occasionally			
they get from home for month or two			
 Some 			
For month or two			
Enjoy laughs 			
Right 			
And fifty percent may be having scooter or motorcycle 			
Scooters fifty-five students have actually			
Yeah 			
Mostly hostel number one has cough most of the			
bikes two wheelers 			
Right 			
Since they are a goonda persons most of			
them laughs 			
Students are there			
Uh because uh when one person is living very near to			
his institution just fifty metres or hundred metres away from his college			
or department so he can go on by foot or			
He he has he has some other work to do			
Yeah 			
Not only study laughs so he faces problem			
Yeah right 			
Everytime you can't walk			
Yeah 			
And you can't have a bus Chandigarh ci city			
you know how it's working			
Ah ha 			
You can't have bus even for one hour 			
Yes yes 			
Sometimes 			
Ah sometime you have to go away to meet your teacher for some			
collecting notes 			
Yeah 			
Or to meet some friends 			
This is really laughs these things happen really			
Since teacher teachers have			
efficient way provide everything in the department 			
Oh yes laughter 			
 			
Want to try ?			
Okay 			
What did you eat this in this uh noon ?			
Noon yeah something you have rice chapati			
 and one sabji plus rice 			
Rice chapati 			
Uh what quality of kind they gave uh in uh your			
Quality is not that much okay 			
Yeah but for some old students that is okay since they 			
Old students they get uh I mean uh what kind of			
preparation they prepare it they are well cooked and uh or			
not or half cooked or something in between ?			
 Preparation 			
Preparation is okay for it depends on see it is uh			
subjective 			
Yeah			
Depends uh if a person is older			
Yeah 			
And he is bullish like that 			
Ah ha 			
So he gets uh well food			
Ah ha 			
But if uh 			
Taste taste ?			
But it depends uh preparation is not okay for			
 in general 			
And uh I think you go sometime outside to have a 			
better taste and better food 			
Food 			
Generally 			
Two three times a a week 			
Two three times a week once the routine ah			
ha 			
 Change 			
Just to have a different taste we go to Sector eleven 			
Lady market 			
Eleven 			
Or Sector fifteen there is a Prince restaurant			
Ah ha 			
That is cheap and best for students			
 Cheap 			
But might something 			
 We can't afford that much uh expensive hotels			
like one word 			
Ah ha 			
And so we go 			
Right 			
And uh about uh dinner ?			
Dinner is something better than the lunch 			
Ah ha 			
Yeah 			
So dinner we have a daal and sabji			
 			
 Daal is good 			
No daal always daal is			
okay 			
Yeah 			
Means you have desi ghee that you 			
laughs so that you know that like me that I 			
 Oh yes 			
And uh about the conditions are this year I am			
planning to be in the food committee I've talked to			
the warden			
 Accha 			
Right right 			
So he said okay uh he will appoint four five members			
Uhm			
We are trying for cooperativeness 			
Yes 			
Ah so if he has the a a all of them like 			
chapati and daal or chawal 			
they are well cooked not overcooked sometime or not uh 			
No this is not the case			
Case is the spices are not good qua of good			
 quality or the ghee is not of good			
quality 			
 Ah ha 			
 So that way you can't say you can't tell			
it is really well cooked or it is			
Cooked is okay sir Cook he is one word 			
 Uh like chilli they use more chilli then you			
can't tell			
No this is not this is not the case 			
Uhm uhm			
Chilli they have they have a routine 			
Like there is a joke you know uh when a person went			
to in a hostel 			
He was married			
Uhm 			
And he was uh staying alone 			
So he said uh hello waiter bring me some burnt			
 chapatis ?			
Bring me some burnt toast ?			
He said sir why ?			
Because uh I'm you know feeling sickness of my			
home laughs 			
You know I want to have rice at laughter 			
So you know uh some sometimes uh a married person he			
want to feel free so he goes to hostel 			
When he want wants to uh remind his			
 feel uh bachelor days some kind of feel a new bachelor 			
I have my mamaji here 			
Uhm uhm 			
Not exactly my mamaji but a relation			
like mamaji 			
Uhn uhn 			
So he used to talk to me that food bring			
some thing			
Uhm uhm			
 Sabji from your hostel laughter 			
two words so that I too I too want to feel that those old days			
Even then that some kind of things that reminds you some			
 uh uh when you were young			
Everything is related to laughter something else			
Something else 			
No while not also not only of food but 			
something else 			
 You think of something else exactly			
Like that and all 			
So there in uh those enjoyments so fun 			
 This phase is the best phase of 			
someone's life			
Yeah yeah 			
 That's what I think 			
Ah 			
Even I don't want to be out of this city laughter			
 That's why I'm staying here after my			
completion of post graduation 			
 Oh yes yes 			
 			
You have some two or three meals uh breakfast and 			
lunch and dinner and 			
Yeah three major meals 			
 			
Yeah what what all what do they serve ?			
In breakfast uh you get it's upon you 			
it's upon your taste 			
You can have parathas you can have bread 			
butter bread omelette 			
You can have bread jam 			
So many things like you feel they'll have in the hostel			
 or in home 			
So it's your taste 			
And you can have tea cold drink milk anything 			
what you can think of in the in a breakfast 			
What else ?			
And uh breakfast you know there that's the			
place where cooking is not okay 			
Since in the morning there is a great rush 			
Everyone has to go to their department before nine			
 Great rush yeah 			
Yes 			
So most of the students get ready by eight thirty 			
And everyone rushes in the mess and canteen eight			
thirty and they ask for quick supply 			
 Eight thirty 			
 That's what has some times we noticed that a			
 a little more time can be can make it more better that uh 			
food			
But this is not possible means uh 			
 Right yeah 			
 That's why I was talking how they cook I mean they 			
overcook see or less cooked			
 See 			
Afternoon and uh uhm dinner and lunch is okay			
Since they have plenty of time 			
They are back from their department			
But in the morning they have to go to the department			
 Ah ha 			
Yes yes 			
And if they get late they may they may miss 			
their class			
 And that 			
Then they do not bother about the taste they have just			
eat it and rush like that 			
 They don't bother about anything 			
laughter 			
This is uh Punjab 			
They have to go			
Those are points where the problem arises			
Yeah 			
They ask for quality plus quick supply			
Plus quick supply yes yes 			
Uhm even the cook has to his matlab			
 it depends ke us ke pas uh that material is			
there 			
He has to make something raw material and then cook it 			
It takes sometimes 			
 So 			
Now you have uh completed your M A second year			
Yeah 			
So what's your planning now ?			
What you have planned ?			
I am just two words was there four five old 			
laughs 			
I have four five years uh one word 			
Ah ha 			
But I am unfortunately couldn't decide till now 			
Ah ha 			
And I I am planning for a teaching profession 			
I have been offered a job as ad hoc professor of English 			
in my college where I've studied			
I have done my graduation			
Ah ha it's very good			
I am also planning for M Phil or Ph D 			
Since I have discussed the topic with my professors			
Uhm			
I don't know anything about the what we have to do 			
what is there 			
So I have to			
Is the teaching system			
I have 			
How that we should read			
Why we have to read why what we have to study			
Ah ha 			
What is the procedure 			
Is there any exam is there research so I don't know			
anything			
I just know it's M Phil it's Ph D			
 It's Ph D			
Just like M A 			
So I don't know anything and uhm I am planning for 			
career in customs 			
I have applied uh filled the forms for there is a post 			
Inspector Customs and Income Tax 			
And for the one word 			
 Ah ha right right 			
That means you have no definite programme where wherever			
you get the better opportunity you'll go 			
 Not only not have a definite see which is if			
you uh stick to one thing cough 			
Uh you take the case of I A S preparation uh			
 one word aspiration everything uh 			
So if we take a single option			
 Uhm right 			
Yeah 			
And we uh didn't succeed in future			
Yeah 			
 It's a problematic one word 			
Yeah 			
Since I have seen persons			
Persons that's right			
Who have been staying here for last six seven years in my			
hostel			
Uhm 			
And they are trying only for I A S			
Yes 			
And unfortunately many persons they are not that			
much of that much level or may be possible luck 			
doesn't favour them			
 They did not get through 			
 Yes yes 			
Ah 			
So they are nowhere now a days			
Right 			
And uh three or four of my best friends			
Uhm uhm 			
Two of them have left for their homes after wasting			
their seven years			
Oh 			
So you can think if you stick to single option 			
 I don't think we'll ever succeed			
 Yes yes 			
Uh now a days we have to 			
 Since there are three four options			
Yes 			
So you go any try three four ways			
Uh 			
And if you succeed in any one way it's alright 			
Right 			
And uh same is the case for U G C 			
Uhm			
If anyone everyone ask I have to be professor 			
 it is difficult since population is increasing and jobs are			
that much			
 Oh yeah 			
Limited 			
Yeah 			
In every fields jobs are limited			
This is all case of population 			
Yes laughs 			
Since people are doesn't bother even the uhm 			
family planning programme is not okay I don't think they advertise on T			
V on radio 			
If a person is poor how can he afford T V or radio 			
Oh yes even if he uh watches uh			
television or hears radio he doesn't imply to his own you know			
 One word 			
The teaching of English in the schools is extremely faulty			
True 			
So can you identify the areas where basically the problem			
lies with students of English in the schools ?			
In in the area of pronunciation sir I have 			
Uh is okay			
Laid down on many problems that uh one is that 			
they don't maintain the length of the vowels and they shift 			
there is a phonemic alternation 			
In place of one vowel they use uh the other vowel 			
Like uh in uh while saying the word zero some of my			
students say jero 			
Some will say zero but the others will say jero 			
So there is phonemic alternation 			
Some will say amit but some will say omit some will			
say oomit 			
Some will say for example obedience obedience some			
will say abedience obedience 			
So faulty pronunciation I feel it it travels into			
their uh uhm their whole career 			
And uh from the very beginning we have got a faulty			
pronunciation 			
Ah now look at one thing my problem basically with			
teacher of English is not so much phonemic 			
I have a very serious doubt about the grammar			
 the lack of really grammar which the students have			
For instance even at the M Phil level I've come			
across cases of students mixing up the tenses in the same sentence			
I mean the present tense past tense and in one case			
 I discovered all the three tenses used in a long sentence 			
And I said you have left out nothing absolutely 			
So that's one problem 			
And I think much greater attention needs to be paid towards			
 grounding 			
I am not talking of I mean the traditional grammar but			
atleast the modern approaches to grammar should atleast be given to			
the students 			
And what I find is probably this is a deficiency which			
later on becomes incurable 			
Because what you are trying doing to do 			
is what you do at the the school level and what is going to be			
confirmed at the undergraduate level is what will survive eventually at			
the postgraduate level you see 			
 Really 			
 They use present and past and 			
 Even 			
 Basics of basics of English language is 			
Sir don't you think they 			
 So that is the structure 			
Don't you think this deficiency lies some to some extent			
 uh with the teachers 			
Exactly			
They cannot impart uh the good in a pro 			
 Exactly exactly that of course is one part of it			
That I mean it's like the blind leading the blind in many			
cases I mean 			
The students themse the teachers themselves are not aware			
 of the rules of grammar they are themselves violating and			
 naturally that is the violation they are passing on to the students			
For instance I came across some books I mean written			
for students I mean grammar I mean general English for students of B			
A one and B A two by a group of professors of various colleges three			
four of them joining hands writing 			
And I discovered the essays which were written one is			
ungrammatical English 			
And I marked out certain portions in which there were howlers I			
mean and I said if this is the essay the student is going to read and in			
many cases commit to memory what sort of English is the student			
eventually going to learn from there cough 			
 I'll give just one example 			
I forget which one are they but because some teachers gave and			
gave me those copies I mean complimentary copies			
And I said one word let me glance through it said			
 aap ki bacchi bhi padthi hai so but my daughter was in B			
A two or three at that time so she will be of in need of some of them 			
So we are leaving these copies			
Alright but let me go through them and let me see are they in the			
right sort of English			
And I discovered and I infact told one of them sir you			
are an M Phil and is this the sort of English you your 			
yourself writing 			
What better English will the students write if this is the sort of			
 ungrammatical English you are writing 			
So this is the basic fault			
I find two basic problems with students who come to my			
department for instance one is the grammar lack of grammar			
The second is lack of I mean what I would say vocabulary			
Vocabulary is sometime so deficient that if I try to convey			
something I have to look through these basic English virtually at time			
 cough 			
Is that your Michael West I made use of yes at two			
different stages 			
One when I was editing a play of Shakespeare for students 			
Secondly when I was teaching at a place which is in a very 			
backward area of Punjab Bhatinda 			
So there people told me that here in English people are very			
very deficient and they use a Hindi terms for it angrezi mei			
haath bada tang hai 			
 Yeah 			
 Yes 			
 Haan haan 			
So I mean I said			
Typical Punjabi 			
 Ah yes yes 			
And they said Saxena saab you'll have to			
teach English for a change in Hindi and Punjabi 			
I said at the master's level you expect uh there			
is no help for it you will find it impossible to convey anything to them			
I said don't worry I will not come down to Hindi or			
Punjabi 			
 I'll teach them in English of course I'll 			
have to be very careful in the choice of words that I am going to use			
 			
And that was the second time I made use of the Service List of			
Michael West 			
And what I did is gradually I would introduce everyday 			
of course it it involved lot of labour seven			
or eight new words 			
And that was also graded I mean these are the words			
 I'm introducing today these are words I am introducing tomorrow 			
And my effort was an every month it should be around			
two hundred words I should be able to increase in their vocabulary 			
And I discovered their vocabulary was almost doubled by the			
time they completed the first session I did it you see 			
And naturally they would understand English better 			
So what I find is that these are the two basic deficiencies 			
Phonetics is yes it is deficiency 			
But phonetics does not pose such a major problem			
You know why ? cough 			
Because perhaps you have read also that there is now a			
consensus I mean atleast that English can be pronounced slightly			
differently in different parts of the world I mean 			
I mean Australians pronounced it differently 			
Canadian pronounce it differently America pronounce it			
differently 			
English that is to say the Queen's or the King's 			
English is differently pronounced 			
But then even in England there is variation in pronunciation			
 It is being 			
 America 			
Regional variation 			
Regional variations that fairly wide regional variations I			
mean even in England 			
So that's what I find			
Phonetics is important in it's own way but that's			
 not the be all and end all of teaching of English mind you 			
What is more significant for the students is teaching of elementary			
rules of grammar 			
And what I find is there is a very small book I came across			
published by Times London at two words 			
The name of that book is in fact that's a series of books			
maybe Pushpinder I sho sho showed you those books I mean 			
 A grammar in sixty minutes that's the			
title of that book I mean grammar in sixty minutes 			
We have one or two such titles in our department I think they got			
them from there 			
Now maybe not in sixty minutes but that book of grammar			
which gives the essential rules of grammar can be inculcated in the			
students in about a month's time 			
And even that would be in a series 			
So that's what I found out			
Yes			
I don't know whether you came across that book 			
But I keep on hunting for it not at my I am basically not			
concerned with teaching of language 			
But I am concerned of course with correctness of language 			
So it's in that context I hunted out those books in			
Delhi 			
Maybe it could be some information for you also 			
 Laughs 			
So it's something about the vocabulary why don't			
you elaborate ?			
Means as far as your student is concerned or your			
teachers are concerned ?			
 Sir two words 			
Vocabulary true it's it lacks people lack			
vocabulary 			
And uh sometimes even students they know the answer			
sometimes but they don't find words to express themselves 			
And uh of course teachers help them and we are			
 even even if			
 word in Hindi 			
He he talks about dictionary 			
Yeah 			
 That's uh 			
The dictionary habit			
 One word 			
And that is what students seriously lack I tell you			
For vocabulary			
They have to be made to look up the dictionary and that			
should be the habit with I mean I one word that my			
student 			
 Every child should have			
If you are ten percent doubt consult the			
dictionary 			
Don't presume this is the meaning because what you presume is			
 it's normally wrong			
 One word dictionary with him 			
Normally wrong 			
Go to a dictionary and what I normally tell the students			
is have a big dictionary on your desk			
A desk dictionary whether it is C O D or whether you've			
 Chambers depends on whether you know phonetics or you don't know			
phonetics one of these two 			
But keep a small dictionary always in your pocket in the case			
of girls they can in their 			
Yeah purse 			
 I mean purses I mean a small one whether it			
is Little Oxford Dictionary yeah or Collin's Gem			
Dictionary because the problem with students many times is they are			
lazy			
They would not like to go from one place to the other to lift			
the dictionary 			
That is the hassel they won't like to do 			
If it is right in their pocket then perhaps they will			
bring it out 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 But if they have if they have 			
it in their bags they will just take it out and find 			
 Yes it will become easier for them to consult			
at time 			
 That's what I have been telling my students again			
and again 			
 I always encourage them to bring			
dictionaries cough everyday 			
Another book			
And uh 			
Which I would mention and I may be it's of some			
use to you that is Elements of Style by			
Strung and White 			
Have you seen it ?			
We have six copies in our departmental department			
 in the main library			
And I find it has hardly been issued for so many years			
You see that's of course an older edition			
I have a new edition revised edition because the original was			
written by Professor Strung it has been revised by E D White 			
You see that's not in paper back also 			
But paper back is also quite costly 			
But what I suggest is atleast the teachers who are			
interested can consult them Elements of Style			
 			
 Elements of Style 			
You know why because Fowler is formidable in			
 it's length 			
Not everybody likes to consult or read it 			
But that Element of Style is just			
ninety-eight pages 			
I mean not very difficult to simplify it 			
And I find I gave it some of my M Phil students who had			
problems with usage and all that and they said it has been useful 			
And interestingly I discovered Pushpinder I was reading a			
column in this uh Times of India Sunday and			
it there was an article by Nissim Ezekiel who said he was using this very			
book for his M A students Elements of Style I			
mean that's what happened before this Nissim			
retired last year from uh that Bombay University so it is very good			
for his students 			
 Yeah 			
 A By just a matter of chance I			
discovered in that article that I mean the same thing I have been using also			
 for my students 			
I think you tell the professor about your plans for			
further work or 			
Yeah 			
About your teaching 			
Teaching is more or less over you can talk of what are your			
plans for further work research if you are doing or publishing or			
anything else 			
Sir I'll think of publishing it and revise it			
 and uh put in all your suggestions that quantitative analysis of			
the data I'll take up and I'll get it published			
You know the problem is many students in fact I would			
say majority of students once they have got their Ph D I mean and			
they think well			
They go and sleep laughs 			
We have reached the destination laughs nothing			
more is I mean we have got our degree			
We can write doctor with our name and that's the end of			
it			
It happened with one of my scholar though 			
It was my first research one word he was a school teacher			
also 			
When he came I said what exactly is your provocation			
for registering for the Ph D I said do you think you			
stand to get anything by getting a Ph D in English 			
He gave a very curious reply to me 			
He said sir when my daughter gets married I want			
to issue the card which carries my name as doctor laughter			
 the reason for it haan 			
Uh right 			
I am Rana Nayar 			
And I am Sudeep Minhas 			
So Sudeep what do you think we should talk about this			
morning ?			
 That's what I am thinking laughs 			
Why don't you set the ball rolling 			
 That's what I am thinking			
 Let's talk about feminism			
 Let's just continue the yesterday's 			
discussion 			
I think it's very interesting I I I			
 wasn't participating yesterday 			
Right			
So I would like 			
 But that was uh more personal in nature			
because 			
Yes we won't talk			
I was just uh drawing upon my personal 			
experience and talking about it 			
Uh and how of course I started off as the feminist			
 and uh became more of a male chauvinist later 			
 Experience 			
 A few words 			
Yes 			
So why don't you share a bit of your experience			
 so that we will be on 			
 About feminism 			
About how man feel 			
 Even ground 			
How man feel			
How strongly you feel about this whole idea of 			
feminism ?			
 Feminism right 			
Uh now I'll we can't say how strongly I feel about it			
But I think it most of the personal experience is that you			
slowly begin to realise that being a working woman makes you more of			
a you know a target of male chauvinism 			
Had I been a housewife I think I would have certainly 			
enjoyed more privileges than I do now laughs 			
Do you regret being a career woman ?			
 Is that what you are trying 			
 No I think the satisfaction the satisfaction			
for my subject gives me uh I mean it's a kind of balances			
the whole thing 			
But sometimes I think uh I certainly wish I just could relax at			
home and you know the chores that I do now I mean if were to do			
just those chores and I would feel certainly much more happier 			
But that will not really make you uh			
feminist ?			
Then then what you are asking for no			
 is some kind of a typical role that is assigned			
 to women			
 Well I 			
 No 			
 No 			
 Exactly 			
 No the 			
 I'm saying I am saying this is what I had			
encountered 			
Not that I want to be like that			
This is what I have encountered from me 			
 Given a choice you won't like			
Exactly uhm exactly 			
I mean uh we have certain dreams I feel all young girls			
have certain dreams and uh then uh when I was about twenty-five			
twenty-six just before my marriage			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
I I had this kind of a dream that okay I'm going			
to set certain rules if I'm working and he is working we are			
going to divide uh what we are going to do 			
But I think and I ended up with a lot of problems 			
Uhm uhm			
Got lot of problems			
Uhm uhm 			
So I think uhm that's what when you were talking			
about yesterday one word better you know that yes one sets			
out thinking that yes one is feminist but when actually slowly you			
 when you when you actually uh face the realities when you come			
down to the ground realities I think one is so much more happier in the			
conventional truth 			
 Same's happened with me			
Uhm uhm 			
When I think it would have been I think my mother is in a			
much better position and a situation than I am 			
She is much more respected 			
Ah ha 			
I am the one who is supposed to be you know going out and			
having fun but still I am working the most of the one word you know			
 laughter 			
And my mother just because she is a mother you know she is lady of			
the house			
She has so much more respect 			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh I think I lose out on that			
And I sometimes wish and I crave for that kind of an adoration			
and looking upto laughter looking upto 			
Are you trying to say that as we get on in years we become			
more of uh man or more of woman uh is that the idea ?			
 Now about the one word 			
Yes I mean have we I mean I think had I been given			
enough uh wh what should I say had the situation been			
different and the convention been different then I would have certainly			
loved to be a liberated woman or the or as we say the working			
woman or a professional kind			
I would have certainly loved to be that			
Would you like to say that all working women are liberated			
in that sense in your words ?			
 No they are not no no 			
Then ?			
I mean I would have loved			
Opting for a career only way of seeking liberation 			
Yes it is of course to uh to ce to a			
great extent yes I I I agree with			
that to a great extent of course as sometimes doing one word 			
 Is it not 			
 Uh would you like to think of liberation purely in			
ecnomic terms			
 It's >/w> not just that Rana it's not just			
that			
 It's so much more you can I mean sometimes I think you			
just tend to uh build a build up so much when you are at home and			
this is some kind of an outset			
I think it's not just economical it's 			
psychological also 			
And the the very fact of moving out of the house I think			
 man enjoys that don't they ?			
I mean you make them sit at home for uh say about uh uh			
not even a week say two days I mean right if they have a			
prolonged weekend they just begin to tend to get irritated they			
 they won't move one word they feel			
confined 			
I think the very fact you know this this breaking			
of the psychological barrier yes that even I am moving out 			
 Right 			
Right			
This is physical moving out is sometime equated uh			
with the with the psychological uh opening up 			
Right 			
Right uhm I mean you can carry on 			
 uhm I mean I don't know what to think about that laughter			
I hope			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Of course we can always agree to differ as			
far this is concerned because 			
 Oh yes 			
 Why not why not why not 			
Of course he has got an absolutely different uh say			
No because I am a staunch believer in uh what I call 			
biological determinant you see 			
 Now what is biological determinant ?			
 Please explain that you were saying yesterday also 			
 Uh I know uh uh I know I know laughter 			
I know I am going to raise lot of hackles when I say that 			
But this is exactly what uh what my life experience is that			
 things are what they are because of bio biology and biology			
is what conditions are 			
And we cannot really be any different or we cannot really go			
very far from where we start 			
 I think don't we give meanings to biology			
I think let to itself it would have been much more simpler			
I mean it would have been much more uh on the equal			
ground had I mean we give a lot of meaning to what biology means as such			
I am not really trying to			
And this is I don't know anything about 			
biological determinism exactly laughter 			
I have no scholarly laughs background about this			
 So do impose and stuck upon 			
Nor do I for that matter			
And two words justify thing			
And if not really meant be scholarly discussion but 			
I know no but still I don't what it is but I			
 somehow feel personally that we give a lot of meaning because 			
that's the way we want it to be 			
 That's the way our society wants it to be 			
Yeah that would be another way of looking at it but uh			
You mean biologically men are stronger than women ?			
I am not talk talking in terms of relative strength			
 that men are stronger and women are weaker 			
But what I am trying to suggest is that whether it is			
psychology or sociology or cultural pattern or behaviourial			
pattern all stem from a certain kind of biological makeup 			
Everything else follows you see 			
Everything else comes later 			
It begins there 			
No I think it begins no no no 			
 And 			
 And and perhaps you see 			
 when when when women talk in terms of liberation			
uh ar are they talking in terms of being more of men than			
 women			
Is that what they want ?			
Equality with men does it mean that they want to be like			
men ?			
I I would not really be very happy with that kind of situation 			
if women were to be like men or where try to become			
men because			
 I feel 			
 This is I can I 			
 That's true I mean they			
As far as that goes reversal of roles can never take			
place 			
I I uh I am agree 			
 For instance one of the extreme is one of			
the extreme position that I think of is that man can never give birth			
I was thinking of it I was thinking of it 			
 so			
 So to say 			
You see that is something which women alone			
can do			
 One word 			
But that does not			
Call it a previlege or whatever yes but			
 it's granted only to uh I think men are poorer for this			
reason that they are they cannot give birth			
 Yes 			
No but that's I think that is a 			
 very fine way of saying we are poor so we should			
be allowed to do this we should be allowed to do this			
 Because 			
 Because 			
 This is this is 			
 This is 			
One way in which they can somehow satisfy a creative			
impulse 			
A man is always trying to laughs give expression to			
it in so many different ways			
And I think half the time he doesn't succeed 			
I don't know about that problem but I think you know uh			
 laughter what's more important is as I was saying the			
husband is one word I mean as you were saying about this			
reversal of role I believe in it yes and I think that should not			
be just by giving birth I think she should not be denied of other			
things			
I mean I think she feels proud of it yes that she is a mother			
And it so much more natural for a mother to have that kind of			
relationship with the child which of course the father can never have it of			
 right but it develops slowly 			
But again is that an excuse for her not being 			
I mean so that she should not be taking such and such role she			
should not be doing this and this thing is that some kind of a constraint			
Just because she happens to be a mother			
 Right 			
Certainly not and I want I don't even want to 			
suggest that it should be a kind of a constraint 			
The idea is you first identify yourself with what you are			
You accept yourself for what you are			
Yes right 			
You accept your limitations you accept your strength 			
and from there you proceed 			
Very fine			
You see a woman may be or a man for that matter let			
me not talk only of women 			
If a man also wants to liberate himself then I think every			
man needs to liberate himself or all human beings need to liberate			
themselves because all of us have this basic impulse to move towards			
some kind of an autonomy growth may be this is something			
that we all think about			
And this is exactly what I mean by liberation 			
 Exactly 			
Exactly			
Moving towards some kind of a higher state yes			
 of growth 			
Growth which you may measure in whatever terms you chose			
to 			
First one word maybe social psychological 			
spiritual material any term you chose to			
Terms you can define for yourself			
But I am talking about the basic idea of growth and that			
alone means liberation to me			
 Yes 			
Exactly			
So for that kind of growth I think it's very			
important I mean that's the way I look at it 			
For a man and for that matter even a woman to accept 			
himself herself 			
And this kind of self- acceptance is exactly what doesn't really			
count most one word 			
Exactly as it is			
Which becomes a hindrance in a way and 			
this in itself is a kind of bondage 			
 I 			
Right 			
 I'll give you I'll give you uh a			
personal example for that matter 			
When you were saying that when woman want to be uh woman			
want to be liberated are they trying to be like man 			
I will give you an example 			
My husband likes a very clean house			
He likes to remain at home 			
He likes to do all the things 			
And believe it he loves to do needle work also			
Uhm uhm 			
I don't 			
I am the one who would rather sit and have a one word 			
newspaper 			
Yes I love to that is one thing I like to 			
But he do does all the other things 			
Whenever we are together on the weekend			
You know thinking is generally thought to be a man's			
 priority right I I			
Not necessarily 			
No yes 			
Not necessarily			
Yes 			
I I I you know I will give you so many examples from			
 Men are warriors not thinkers 			
No laughter 			
Uh I wonder this has been actually defined you know what what			
gossip consist of because one of the things that it consists of is uh			
uhm attitudes and emotions I mean it's a very emotive kind of use of			
languages this precisely gossip			
 Precisely 			
 Precisely precisely this is			
 this is very			
Highly coloured			
Highly coloured			
Now gossip I believe is like humour which is peculiar to every			
language			
Uhm 			
And every culture and every you see and there is			
something which is which you can't pass on			
Uhm 			
I mean just as you cannot see poetry is something basic			
 uhm the people and culture so has humour			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
And I think more than poetry and humour is gossip			
Uhm 			
Because it is there letting yourself go and 			
letting yourself go is letting your say orientation of thinking and			
feeling yeah really have a free place			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
And that kind of thing you see I wonder if 			
they see that is some of us you've to do it in the language in			
which you see this is not that it will be that oriented			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Some of us would be playing to the oriented and say other			
languages that means other than our own and isn't it			
 might be possible but I do not know how far is 			
this possible 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Because there are certain words you know 			
which have that value 			
Uh for instance words like faltu and uh 			
you know 			
You see this is I think			
 Patao or some such things			
Pushpinder this is letting yourself go			
Yeah 			
Now whether you can let yourself go yeah in a			
language which is not the language of your			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
I mean basic upbringing or basic say orientation of			
your yeah thinking and feeling structures			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
You see this is yeah that is this an 			
and mostly gossip is just than talking about nothing			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
And yet you see you find people extremely at home which is			
there			
Yeah 			
And extremely interesting			
Yeah 			
I mean if you if you would reduce it to a 			
some kind of a dramatic content 			
 Yeah 			
Uhm 			
Anyway it accounts to nothing			
Uhm 			
And yet you see when when you			
 you see see people gossiping yeah I			
think they they're completely I mean there is sort of two			
words sense of feeling at home yeah you see			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Perhaps it has a psychological uh dimension as well as a			
social one			
And we are talking about you know one word social			
cultural uh pattern there which are evident or it's a			
 it's a form of social behaviour which is			
 specific to any culture to uh but I think there is a			
psychological dimension as well			
Just as in humour there is a psychological dimension that			
you know it's a play of the uh uhm subconscious or in			
 in in grotesque in fantasy I mean it's			
 it's subconscious coming out 			
So even in gossip there are these these psychological factors			
isn't it ?			
Some kind of hatred or uh maybe some feelings of angrer or			
jealousy or whatever			
You know one word instead of uh you			
because you don't have a way of expressing them openly or just saying how			
I hate so and so or uh I I detest that person and uh I wish I could			
kill him or some such thing 			
You don't uh pu put it in that way but you 			
gossip about that person or you talk about that person about 			
 little things that the person does or doesn't do and so on going			
out with so and so or having a 			
 One word 			
 But that's one word 			
 No I wanted to say they are psychological			
Yeah			
Probably trying to make some kind of distinction between this			
social and psychological			
Yeah 			
And I I I don't think I			
don't think 			
 Not yeah not the total distinction but I			
mean these are two aspects			
 No I 			
No no I don't think they I don't think			
 They 			
Yeah			
I don't think they are two aspects 			
I think they two words relatonship is rather organic			
Uhm uhm			
It is psychological in fact if you try to understand it and			
see it in terms of the genisis			
Uhm 			
You will find rooted in your collective unconscious			
Uhm			
You will find it rooted in your then 			
obviously your habits are really coming to terms with it			
 Right 			
Right			
Coming to and and expressing it			
Yeah yeah			
So so we two words that distinction does not stand			
Yeah 			
You see the the the in between the			
collective social and yeah then psychological			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
You see what in fact you see one I mean one could say			
 is that this is the say the the the 			
pshychological factor that you are talking about would be I mean how			
an individual absorbs uhm you see or response to whatever one			
has inherited			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
This is not that collective uh you see level			
 uhm that of ones uhm I mean social			
existence			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
So it is they they there would be			
of course I am not trying to rule out the personal inclusion personal			
action uhm personal action will be there			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
But the personal action would be see you will have to see in			
terms of uh I mean the style of one's feeling I mean talking			
about one word things or you see stressing certain things 			
 yeah or			
 Yeah 			
Now suppose you were to take a the 			
 con concrete instance you know 			
Say a concrete instance of how we gossip in the staff room for			
example 			
So I am going to take a another instance like 			
Stardust film gossip or some such things			
True true I mean staff room yeah gossip is			
more different from Stardust gossip 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah yeah			
See I I			
So we can take any context and that is the written uh 			
kind of thing and this is uh uh spoken but now if we were trying to			
 if we were to try and analyse uh what we do when we gossip say in			
the staff room or in in a party or something			
Yeah that's true			
Uh what what what social and psychological			
dimensions you you think are are 			
are they 			
 I I'll tell I will tell I will tell I			
will tell I will tell I'll tell you 			
social and psychological dimesions are undermined uhm in even			
whatever we really say pass and start from gossips			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 But we are trying to one word what			
we are trying to do is			
Yeah			
To either run away from certain things uhm 			
from certain tensions uhm from certain contridictions			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
From certain say certain form their phase or certain			
Sure yeah			
Or you see we are trying to have adjustments			
Yeah 			
Or we are trying to really transform them 			
yeah into some kind of socially respectable kind of 			
communicate communication I mean comminicability			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah Uh I			
So the the the I I 			
 mean if we if we yeah had I			
mean this you you they are not talking in the air one word not just			
floating there			
 Yeah 			
Uhm 			
I mean it's not just that I enter the staff room			
when I am off my say phase and I am off my say grounding			
Uhm 			
I I am there and then ob obviously that kind of a			
gossip has acquired a kind of a grammar of its own			
Uhm 			
It has acquired a gradient grade			
 of its own			
Uhm 			
And I only fear that whatever we talk about in			
the staffroom uhm it gets talked about more 			
uhm under the one word of that grammar			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
I mean one word abiding by a certain idiom or a			
certain you see habit of saying things 			
There are certain you see way of verbalising things			
Uhm 			
Rather than you see what may have been gossiped about if			
we were not I mean under this kind of one word of one word			
Yeah 			
Say of another language and striving for ah			
ha specific kinds of effects			
 Ah ha 			
Oh so you think that you know that English comes in 			
 English comes uh in a way over it			
 English comes 			
We we being one word comes in one word 			
right this is this is this is an English coffee			
 Laughs 			
Yeah 			
And when I gossip gossip in English staffroom			
Ha			
And the particular kind of say first one word of			
effects which we uhm think you see are respectable enough			
 Uhm 			
Ah 			
Or which are interesting enough uh which you see			
 which one word have some air of say some air of			
respectability			
 Uh 			
Uhm			
I mean I do not know I mean this is it is directly you you			
wouldn't like to just wait say I mean just like I mean just would			
like to something that is uh vulgar or that is not 			
respectable			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
You see the now this scene of respectability is			
I fear			
Yeah			
Not merely a say a bottleneck			
Uhm			
Only in respect of samething expressing or communicating			
Uhm 			
Probably this also influences in a very constitutive			
 uhm and familiar way what really is said			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
Or what really is talked about			
Uhm uhm 			
So therefore I mean with the the I think the gossip takes			
uh 			
Yeah			
Overtakes us 			
Yeah			
And it's really is is played out yeah			
 through us			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
I mean some kind of isn't it ?			
Yeah 			
But you know it's part of that running away that you said			
in the beginning you know			
That uh it's part of our uh desire to run away			
Uh now English serves a very useful purpose over there			
 because uh running away from our actual circumstances also			
means running away from our language or from our real being and so on 			
And so in the context of the staffroom uh what happens is that			
we run away from those uh real things and uh 			
 No you can't say that 			
 And and what do we run away too you			
see we are not sure 			
 And what we run away too is a constructed 			
 laughter you know discourse 			
 It's it's a it's a constructed			
world cough and uh in that world as you say of course we are			
very careful that we don't violate some of the some of			
the circulated norms you know			
 We we we 			
We we are playing the game			
Yeah 			
And the games for I mean for which in fact we device the			
rules			
Uhm			
But now the rules really get better of us			
Yeah			
So that we game is being played by the rules in fact			
Yeah 			
And we are probably mean we we probably become			
instruments			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
So			
I find that happens quite a lot to me because what			
happens is uh sometimes I violate those rules laughter sometimes			
I what happens is that I am know in the context of staffroom			
one is not supposed to be talk talking seriously about it			
That is right that is what that is that they			
they that is the violation			
 Or not yeah 			
Yeah that's the violation 			
That is			
Now sometimes I put my foot in then I start talking seriously			
 about something which is considered to be you know uh 			
not done there and			
 Uhm see see that 			
 That's not done and			
Yeah			
 That is that is playing fouls 			
And that's the one word yeah 			
that's not something that yeah 			
 You see it one word I I think if if			
there were a referee 			
Yeah			
To see this match of uh yeah I mean to			
monitoring this match yeah I think he he would probably 			
 yeah I mean uh declare it as foul			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah that's right			
Uh uh if you are being honest yeah or			
you are being serious you see yeah this is this a foul play			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
This is not admissable			
 That's right 			
That is exactly as my difficulty here is			
Uhm 			
That the say the gossip itself here			
Uhm 			
Say we we we we just say 			
is is is a kind of a construct 			
Yeah 			
And it's a kind of a some kind of a game 			
you see 			
 Yeah yeah			
Now which we are not very one word very acutely			
aware of			
Yeah 			
You see once we once we start			
playing the game			
Yeah			
The games get better off			
Yeah			
Then so do the rules			
Yeah 			
And so we merely are then the puppets			
Yeah 			
So we are just just his master's voice			
Yeah 			
I am uh Professor Prem Singh of the Department of the			
Linguistics University of Delhi 			
I am Ravindra Gargesh also of the Department of Linguistics			
University of Delhi 			
Uh well since uh we were talking about the			
problems uh that we face in analysis of literary text 			
Uh you see besides you know the text in stylistic analysis			
 uh what other things you are paying attention to ?			
You see I am also engaged along with that the whole problem of 			
uh uh translation and uh and in that you see I have told you that 			
I've been dealing with this problem that all translations are at			
the le level of parole not at the level of langue 			
Now how does this fitting include your theory of stylistics and			
understanding of a text ?			
Ah that's very interesting you see uh first			
of all what comprises textual analysis because coming from the 			
dis discipline of linguistics we have to be micro approach to begin			
with the micro approach 			
Now in the micro approach we have to see what the text is			
constituted of			
Uhm uhm 			
That is the text is a larger uhm uhm symbol			
 Uhm uhm 			
But what is that symbol made of			
Uhm uhm 			
And when we break it into its uh constituent parts 			
 uhm uhm then we have to look at it in terms of its language			
structures			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
Language structures in the sense of in linguistic terms			
 as well as in let us say metalinguistic terms 			
Uhm uhm 			
In the linguistics terms what are the patterns what are the			
 uh how the uh particular sensitivities are issues are coded or			
certain concepts are coded 			
And then how that codification does not remain only the prime			
way does not contain only primary limits but it is to have secondary			
limits within a larger context 			
Uhm uhm			
So we have to look at uh the language at two levels 			
First level is the level of linguistic structures 			
Uhm uhm 			
And in second level will be level of lexical significations			
Significations within textual context 			
So what your significance is not really significant in the			
sense of uh the contemporary or French school in the sense that a			
particularly there is an a company where they are			
trying to deconstruct the text 			
You don't seem to be deconstructing the text in any significant			
way where either the the entire structuation of signification uh			
 falls apart in a way but at the same time it gives you the peep 			
a peep into human minds			
It also believes a kind of psychological and philosophical and			
historical forces involved in understanding of a text 			
Very right very right 			
Uh we are I mean the kind of analysis that I am doing these			
are variants between French school different way 			
But that was primarily because I think the text as way odd			
identity 			
And uh perhaps I would not like to begin analysis wherever I			
want 			
So that is one defect because for the in the deconstruction			
 one can bring in anything 			
You can bring in your subjectivity to interpret the text 			
Whereas if text is structured if human mind is structured			
 or if language is structured then definitely the text must also uh			
 get restructured 			
And if the text has a structure we have to go from some recent			
structure towards the end or towards significations 			
Basically what you are trying to establish is a kind of a 			
grammar of of stylistics and grammar of analysis 			
And you know if I quote uh that these all grammars leak			
So what are the leakages in your laughter 			
Yes the grammar is weak and there are major weaks in this			
grammar so that 			
 Even even you see though in all linguistic			
analysis we know that in Panini grammar which is called the perfect			
grammar is is really an imperfect grammar otherwise yeah			
 Katyayana would not need to write uh would not have needed to write			
separately and then openly didn't need to get up and defend Panini			
against Katyayana			
And sometimes uh you know one word makes a uh fun of			
himself			
 Yeah 			
Oh alright 			
 Two words fool of himself when defending Panini			
Ahn			
Uh so one word worried about is what are the			
leaks in your grammar of style and your grammar of literary analysis ?			
Well there are many leaks			
Ahn 			
 It's leaving of it's leaving everywhere			
Because firstly there is no comprehensive that the grammar of uh			
 literary analysis that one word you can put it like that 			
There is no comprehensive 			
For example for poetry for poetic analysis we require a			
separate set of parametres for analysis 			
For drama which may be a non-poetic text particularly 			
we'll require separate uh uhm parametre for analysis 			
And for stories or narratives we would require still separate			
parametres of analysis 			
So you see there are multiple levels of analysis			
I I and could say to catch that I say one			
is the phonological one is the morphological level third is a			
syntactic level in that way you can't you want to say that at this			
parametre of poetry in these parts fiction then these for drama 			
I say alright poetry is a kind of one word level 			
phonology and uh a drama at the level of uh morphology and and			
text analysis of a a fiction is at the level of syntax			
How would you defend uh your position against mine this this			
 your view 			
 And 			
 Yes that would be uh my position will be at			
variance somewhat 			
Uh for poetic analysis I would agree with you that uh 			
phonological patterns are significant morphological pattern are			
significant syntactic patterns are significant semantic			
configurations will be in the sense of figurative language are			
significant 			
And how these interact and lead down to larger meaning larger			
meaning constructs 			
But in drama things are going to be different because by			
and large we may have sentences which are incomplete 			
So there the unit of analysis cannot be a line because poetry would			
be line laced or stanzas 			
But in drama we'll have to be very different 			
 We'll have to bring in discourse 			
 We'll have to talk about speech events and we will			
have to analyse language as constituting speech event 			
And the drama would have to be seen as a series of speech events			
put together 			
And we will have significations speech that's all about it			
Well I think there are but I still think uh that 			
one word more and more about it that most of this analysis is			
at the le at the level of parole not at the level of langue			
because it doesn't go into the soul of literature 			
Uh so then I think there needs to be some compromise between old			
 what you call philosophical or historical analysis of the text			
There must be now two words now just say it's 			
a phenolo it's phonologian don't want to touch it			
Uhm			
Uh if we do that then your analysis is primarily based on			
the theories of Roman Jacobs 			
Uhm			
And over Jacob's and Bob's to a most of			
the time what you will what modern people will dismiss as			
phonological analysis so that Roman Jacob's and one word			
 pushed in it's nothing 			
Yeah 			
But uh but phonological analysis so we have one needs			
to kind of going to uh certain other aspects and we need to broaden 			
uh uhm from or your uh uh your theory of style uh then say 			
you're basically what's you're doing is as a			
modifying partial position 			
Ah yes in a way you can say that for Ra Roman			
Jacobsan I would say that his theory was a brilliance with it's 			
practice 			
In practice he was a grammarian cough in theory he was			
a phonetician 			
And the two well there was a significant between the two 			
Uh whereas uh uhm for Bob Bob's known known uh			
linguistic facts as well			
He would account for known linguistic facts like uh uh 			
 For the present one word yes Bob was			
not interested in language for say Roman Jacobson was interested			
primarily and in a very fundamental way Uh uh the uh the 			
language yes or the one word work uh verbal			
shiftance yes in Russian			
Uh Russian phonology yes or French phonology			
 Phonographs like uh like 			
 Yeah uh in a way yes 			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
History of French phonology and uh you know and			
uh his you know work on Lithuvanian and Latin accent			
 Yes yes 			
Yes			
They all you know basically he was concerned with			
language			
Even his work on one word is basically how we as a			
linguist can handle and help those unfortunate people for this uh			
uh speech disorders			
Yes we generalise the metaphoric mood and the one word			
 mood			
But uh but I think Bob's was not concerned about any			
of these things			
And needed needed and a few words any of them is			
concerned with these issues 			
So they're actually they should be separated in a way			
totally as to separate theorotically approaches to our understanding			
of literary texts			
Am I right ?			
Well as far as uh the scholars themselves are concerned			
surely they are talking different things 			
But when we approach uh a problem theoritically surely we			
have a right to sympathise 			
And uh I for one would like to sympathise Simpson's side			
 rather extend the Jacobsonian model 			
Because if you see the different analysis that Jacobson has made			
 of the different texts in French and English and so on 			
Always what he has done is he has broken down a text books			
grammatical structures and simply partition the grammatical practice 			
And that was the one word against him 			
That the elements that Roman Jacobson formed in a two words			
 could be found in a pattern of a newspaper as well 			
So he has dramatical patterning or he does not wants			
 want to do the text			
I don't think that that the correct position as for as			
 Roman Jacobson is concerned because Roman Jacobson is very much			
concerned about metres 			
You can't have him that cut a newspaper text and say there is			
a one word constructed every year			
Say for example his analysis of uh great French poet one			
word alright where he talks about metres			
Pushkins he talks about metres 			
You know while no where Bob doesn't mentioned metres 			
 Yeah 			
So while he had laughs 			
That you also have been uh they have been doing it but			
trying to escape metres 			
No I have not never try to escape metre 			
In fact I begin with metrical analysis I begin in phonological			
analysis 			
That the first level of one word 			
The look what I mean is this is that you have not started			
 yes building a theory new theory of metres			
Specifically using the same old metrical Hollan and			
metrical structures and trying to apply them in new thing			
This kind of thing was done by Kaiser and Holla in here 			
 very interesting book on you know that they have book on			
English metres			
 Yes 			
 Yes yes 			
 Yes Kaiser and Holla 			
Yes			
Alright so what do we do probably how do we my my			
concern is how to integrate all these things into main theory of			
linguistic analysis 			
Yes 			
And we must sit down must you know put our minds 			
into understanding these problems 			
I agree with you basically uh but with one difference			
Role of ours is uh analyse is given the uh theoritical			
perspective of the analysis of narratives			
Uhm uhm 			
take for example Chaucer to come back 			
So we can't say that he was not language one word or			
he was not uh doing literary kind of analysis he was not taking			
literature as part of his one word 			
He was taking literature as well			
But of course his preoccupations much large 			
Uhm 			
And uh what I mean to say is that of course there is need			
to integrate everything			
Integrate more into this stylistic theory 			
What we have done so far is not that sufficient 			
Metre must be seen afresh from new perspective I do agree with you			
And uh laughs 			
 Let's move back to again			
Yes			
 Let's try to understand uh the relationship of			
Saussure with all these people particularly Saussurian type one word			
Yes			
And how people have been using them and now and then 			
sometime literary people without even understanding uh what is meant by			
it you know contrast and opposition it 			
What is meant by the Saussure thing that uh all linguistic			
analysis is basically an algebra of oppositions and contrasts			
Yes			
Alright uh even if we leave out all other			
But this is exactly			
And if really think of that uhm two things			
come out of Saussurian analysis very clearly			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
One is that people don't understand			
That this whole theory is based upon two words theory			
of one word 			
Ah ha 			
And other thing that come up very clearly uh all sort			
of Sassurian these people are not kind to uh one word I don't			
understand that the concept of opposition is basically again Red			
Indian and foreigners 			
 It's not Saussure			
Would you like to elaborate on that ?			
Ah yes I can			
See uh when you when Saussure talks about that X and Y 			
and G uhm are in opposition			
And they are in a net net one word of contrast is			
there			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Alright			
Then the same kind of thing was being said by pre-Paninian 			
uh two words authentic			
Uhm			
That sounds are primarily in a system of contrast and			
opposition they do not exist by themselves			
Ah that's wonderful 			
Anjani I have always wondered how did you enter the linguistics			
 can you tell me something ?			
 Sir that's the very interesting question			
I started my career as a teacher of English and in post			
graduated classes I was uh I started teaching Henry James 			
and Browning Ahn 			
Henry James because I was working on him then			
And Browning because no one in that year was teaching Browning 			
 Ahn 			
Which year was that ?			
That was long time back sixty-eight sixty-nine			
Sixty-eight 			
And then in under this graduate classes uh something			
very interesting happened			
The university introduced courses on language 			
Ahn 			
And there was a professor I won't name who was trained			
in C I E F L in the earliest C I E and then in uh Pune 			
ah ahn in linguistics 			
 Ah ahn 			
Ah ahn			
But when he was asked to teach that course he refused 			
Oh			
He said I'm a teacher of literature I won't			
do the job of this course 			
And now the head of the department of English in Science college			
 was a student of London University and had undergone rigorous			
training in linguistics during his days but in his whole life he never			
got chances to teach linguistics other than that he was teaching			
only English and the English courses in classes 			
Uhm			
I was the youngest person he said 			
okay Uhm uh now there is an opportunity for you this is			
the syllabus and either you teach in the class or I teach it 			
 Laughs 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
And if you agree to teach I will teach you Uhm 			
how to teach grammar			
 Uhm 			
I see 			
So I availed those that opportunity			
like this yeah			
Was it a sort of modern linguistic or it was a 			
traditional grammar 			
 No no it was grammar in under graduate classes			
I see it was 			
 It was actually			
Traditional grammar in one word 			
You know Hornby books and some other books			
I know			
But Hornby was the main uhm and some books			
which C I E F L has just published in linguistics 			
 Uhm 			
So I said okay I'll do it 			
Ahn 			
And when in off hours he gave me very good			
background for nessasary 			
Ah ha 			
And of Jesperson particularly Jesperson and in the			
library at all college professors and all there so I got interested 			
Ahn ha			
Then when Professor Verma came to Science college 			
 he I was his student his brother was my classmate so he 			
persuaded me to join the Central Institute of English Hyderabad 			
And there somehow I came in very close contact with Professor			
Gokak			
 Accha 			
 One word he was the Director of that one word			
 Institute in sixty-five			
Uhn			
And that also was interesting in a different way 			
In Patna university we had a book paper on practical views			
 where we were not getting the name of the author or the period			
when there is something was written 			
And we would argue with in the classroom			
 as to which period it could belong 			
Who possibly could be the author just observe it for the style			
of writing 			
And Professor Gokak started during that class of kind of thing			
in this class there			
Yeah 			
In Hyderabad 			
So I could do very well			
Uhm 			
 That's what brought me close to it 			
But I was never very close to Oldfeild who was teaching			
grammar			
Somehow I didn't like him			
Uhn 			
I didn't like his assistant uh who was an 			
American but I got along well with Yadurajan and Nambiar			
Uhn 			
And my pronounciation was very much influenced by the			
 Bihari atmosphere although in high school I was the			
product of an English medium school 			
Our teachers were mostly but Nambiar you know helped			
me in speaking nice English and all his lessons particularly with			
reference to long stresses we used to talk a lot 			
Anyway then I went to south there was one			
The other was Masica			
Uhn for the 			
 We became very friendly for non- academic			
reasons			
We just became very friendly 			
And then I wrote a paper that paper you know uh which			
was written in the train 			
 Uh 			
I see 			
You know I was uh called very urgently I had to go from			
 Hyderabad to Calcutta then to Patna and back 			
And the day I was back was the day when we were supposed to 			
submit the term paper 			
So I had no time 			
Touch and go I think			
In the train			
 One word and in the train and uh he was his			
best because of conditional causes exactly and all that 			
And then I got scholarship to go to Chicago I would say 			
Masica was some what influential he introduced my name there 			
Uh I was one word to go there and then one word 			
these people something happened and uh that was political 			
Uhm 			
So I was my name was chucked out and then I went for			
 under this Chicago scholarship 			
And there I uh in the beginning I was very one word 			
without one word 			
I did not like phonetics			
Uhn 			
You know Bansal was not there when I was there I I didn't			
like it 			
And uh once or twice guide told me if you want to sit 			
in to literature he had no objection 			
I said no I'll study phonetics 			
So that's how I came in but the main point I would say			
 was that it had been a very boring experience to remain a			
teacher of English			
Yes 			
And I've no one word of boring in the sense			
that you are in destined to teach the same author because			
nobody else is ready to change his subject			
You are right 			
So you go on teaching the same			
Year after year			
Go on repeating the same thing year after the year 			
Whereas in this discipline whatever I learnt in Chicago this is			
the best job			
Uhm 			
But what I teach in the classroom like what I'm 			
 I was going to teach is very difficult			
Is very difficult 			
What what I acquired there			
Yeah 			
So it's a process of one word and patience			
which goes on time			
What about you ?			
No when we went to Chicago I one word interesting			
 when we went to Chicago those were really the hot years 			
Yes 			
I think we were			
Yes			
And that debate between uh generative semanticists and			
 that's it what Chomsky was trying to say 			
 That's it 			
Yes			
Although it all started with Chomsky himself			
I mean it all came out of respect in a sense 			
 Other that's right that's 			
right			
And they were also M I C at that time a few words			
 college uh a few words uh George Lakoff			
 That's right 			
And uh it now seems that the issues were not really			
substantial I mean the 			
 The issues were very substantial			
I see 			
The issues were very substantial in the sense that generative			
semanticists were the ones who took these basic thought 			
assupmtions and conclusions of this standard theory very seriously 			
Uh ha 			
And in that process they ran into trouble 			
You you know one of the basic assumption was that all the			
meaning is there in the basic deep tructure			
Uhm 			
You know you you remember the earlier argument as to			
why one or two words is better than the deep structure in that 			
manner is that it's not part of what you hear but one can			
analyse what is here is the basic thing that's the deep structure			
So if all the meaning is there in the deep structure 			
Then you have to think about uh ways in			
which sentences develop from deep structure 			
Yeah			
Which made the process very complex 			
Generative semanticists didn't find it 			
They made it as complex as was necessary to maintain this			
assumption			
Uhm 			
Chomsky on the other hand did not do that when he			
realized that it was has become very complex 			
he withdrew himself 			
Yeah 			
And he said well one word structures one word			
 let's play a role as semanticists 			
And he			
And that was it he uh conflict in the hope so			
actually it was a better theory people had then trivial views of one			
word 			
You know for including one word 			
But still he he maintains the point to the extent that			
 one word 			
But as I was a part of this thing I can see that the issues were			
really very very serious issues according to us 			
But uh certain things disappeared with the one			
word 			
It it disappeared uh with what has suffered two words			
 not exactly the semanticists to uh uh founder of Chomsky			
Uhm 			
Uh you see if you make something very powerful			
Uhm 			
And he becomes so powerful that you can't control it 			
there is no			
It is not possible I know 			
No that is it 			
Then it is no longer your methodology 			
Uhn 			
Do you remember the story of this fossil			
Yeah 			
So the methodology with the generative semanticists developed			
Uhn 			
Which is so complex and so powerful that it could explain			
anything but in a very very complex manner 			
And there may be point two words George Lakeoff			
withdrew things like one word that I wish one word had			
constructed			
Yes 			
And things like global concect 			
 Global 			
Anything could be explained in terms of global concect 			
And he also introduced what he called you know what is			
technically is called one word 			
Uhm 			
You know like it is uh say uh po point uh			
three two seven 			
Uhn			
Percent uh now			
Yes 			
That type of calculation			
Pure mathematical conclusion 			
And that turned majority of practitioners			
Yes			
 Two words 			
It is true that uh you know the the financial crunch which you			
mention the other day			
Uhm 			
That plays a very trivial role because there were other			
people who had Chicago like uh have always have big problems			
that is including one word themselves			
No the point is how can two words trying to make is			
that that cohesive group was not there 			
And there was no attempted attempt 			
forming of			
No no there was			
Society like group 			
No no there was a cohesive group			
Uhm 			
I think that uh also a kind of a few words 			
No no it seems to me 			
There was a cohesive group though not located in Chicago			
throughout the year 			
The other one word 			
 Chicago was Chicago was the centre			
 all the participants used to spend there lot of their income on			
 two words 			
I see okay			
And free you know free publication articles were uh			
available as soon as they were titled			
Yeah 			
And in some cases you know like sometimes one word 			
like writes the script time thing 			
Uhn			
And he just get it xeroxed two words it could be 			
one word 			
And then there would be you know further xeroxing also 			
So it was not that 			
And Chicago linguistic society was the centre of learning			
Yes that you mentioned 			
Yes that was the centre of			
For a while			
For those it was known not there			
Not there at all			
He doesn't know how uh how much one word 			
 was there			
 One word 			
Ah how much fun was there how much excitement was there 			
You can imagine that somebody comes up with the bright idea 			
and he doesn't wait for the next day to go and meet Macaulay 			
 uhm and he writes up a note for pages and you know just push			
it inside the door uhm 			
And Macaulay comes and looks at the notes and decides			
this is something which is really exciting and must be done 			
So it's Macaulay who might justification for that			
analysis			
 I'm talking about electrical precomposition			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
Ah ha			
Which was actually if I use the term invention			
Uhm 			
It was invented by his students not he			
Uh ah 			
But he gave the justification so there was no in in			
terms of Macaulays one word 			
Yeah you were asking about me you know how			
did I			
 Yeah 			
Yeah one word 			
How did I get into because I was also like you teaching			
literature at the university and uh joined linguistics not			
very seriously to begin with 			
But one thing was there that I I did wonder about the way			
literature was used in language this is one thing that's 			
one word 			
And then I was very deeply influenced by Professor Pundit 			
He used to be the head uh English department 			
And we had a very distinguished uh two words was there			
then one word 			
But Professor Pundit in particular and I got attracted to			
socio- linguistic and I did a piece of work uh with with professor			
Pundit on the teachers of Hindi trying to show how Hindi was 			
diverging into different directions one would get Sanskritized one			
word 			
And then I did quite well in my M Ed and Mr Pundit thought			
that I should be in two words in England 			
And there I was quite deeply influenced by Professor one word			
 as a socio-linguistic including also the work of a few words 			
 parti particularly the work of one word because he was my			
 one word 			
 Accha 			
And I worked on the Punjabi immigrants there 			
I think that was the first uh research thesis on 			
immigrants assimilation of the local language maintenance of their own			
language and culture one of I think quiet often quoted 			
Then I came back and uh fortunately got a job here 			
teaching linguistics since but yeah			
We can talk 			
Uhn 			
Uh well that's very fine I have no news since			
nineteen eight years one word sometimes eighty or some			
nine			
 Yeah 			
Eighty-seven perhaps			
Uhn 			
Little before that time seventy-eight seventy-nine yeah			
No seventy-nine yeah because I came back in			
seventy-nine			
 Yeah 			
Yeah okay,			
We met in Hyderabad			
Ah yeah that's true and since then all we			
have been introduced to each other 			
Why is it that uh you and I not have problems			
 differental issues 			
Uhm			
Whereas I find that most socio-linguists uhm			
 do not get along well with their colleagues 			
 Uhm 			
You see			
I I am not talking just for personally			
Yeah			
Purely of academic level 			
What is your view ?			
You see I think uh the problem is that uh most			
socio-linguists I know particular in the Indian context have opted			
for socio-linguistic as a soft option 			
Whereas they they don't want to understand I don't think you			
can do good socio-linguistics without uh sort of fully understanding			
the structure of language 			
I think you have to be I think socio-linguist is is a			
way of being a link and really it's just a bit one word 			
So you have different perspective 			
You may have a generative perspective but you may socio-			
linguistic perspective			
But both are trying to be linguist 			
So I have I have always benifitted from what Chomsky had to			
say or what the one word say or what other theoritical linguist			
have to have to say 			
I have never had any cult of socio 			
 That's one word 			
There is a point that if you are doing socio- linguistic			
or one word linguistic you are concentrating from the			
linguistic point of view either on phonology or morphology or syntax or			
may be two of them or three of them			
Yeah 			
And each one has to had statistical approach other			
than the question of socio-linguistic variables and how to analyse it and			
then what kind of conclusions you want to draw 			
Ah keeping that in mind do you think that there			
should not be a conflict between theoritical linguistic and you know			
socio-linguist			
No I don't think I think they that the goals are 			
common except I will add one one word now this is my recent in			
the last three or four years 			
Uh so far I'm concerned it should apply equally well			
with theoritical linguist and socio-linguists 			
But I think it applies more to socio-linguist because theoritical			
linguist can always find other justifications which socio-linguist I			
think will not be justify justifying with that 			
I think socio-linguist has a social responsibility 			
He cannot escape the question of language at all 			
A pure theoritical linguist who is dealing with it pure as			
pure form and a pure mathematical form will say I'm 			
interested in abstract logic and mathematical development although he			
may not you see but 			
Well the they represent not so expert little			
 warden and uh they're planning to one word 			
 as a one word of 			
What was the main reason for that ?			
No particularly particular reason at			
all just and we feel that he is not caring about his job 			
Hardly ever comes to the mess and all 			
Or do the students demand something ?			
No no no no we we've got I think all things that we			
need 			
But so far the warden has never been quite good in his job 			
He hardly ever comes to the mess he's supposed to look			
after the food and all 			
He doesn't come to the mess at all			
 Ah ha ha 			
Just he atleast food about the 			
 He's least bothered about anything except his			
 uh residence and telephone and all those things			
 One word 			
But don't you find any other way to convince him that 			
to show him how by some other means			
No we tried to convince him but unfortunately he's			
 beyond convincing 			
Uhn but I think that this is the usual problem in almost all			
the hostels of D U uh that the authorities when they get			
 uhm residence didn't pay attention on hostel its 			
organisation this is the usual problem 			
 Uh 			
So in all the cases these the students feel that the			
authorities are doing nothing then the authorities should be one			
word 			
 Yeah yeah you people are justified and what I am			
saying uh that maybe that uh are something which uh which			
directly affects to the students that's why these people are very			
much one word 			
Uhn 			
Yeah 			
 That's it uh and the thing			
is that the managing body and other things they are supporting			
 Uh 			
How about the other one word part one word 			
They are okay 			
Okay and uh			
They are okay means in the sense that they didn't create any			
problems			
Ah ha 			
The warden as a matter of fact never created any problem but			
 he was useless laughs 			
As a matter of fact if we if we if we 			
don't have any authorities at all we're better off ah ha			
 I think that			
 Ah ha 			
What about your R T ?			
 He's okay okay			
He is doing his post uh 			
Yeah well whatever we tell him to do he does 			
Was the concept of R T as the one word post			
No concept at all I don't know about any concept			
Why don't you two words any authority in the hostel 			
especially in our hostel 			
Yeah 			
Or we don't just care about that authorities we do			
whatever we want			
Oh 			
I thought you just say yes and one word sign of the			
 one word 			
 I came to know that in one word 			
every hostel is like an institution and so that's why 			
they've appointed one R T uhm with other trainee 			
 Uhm 			
The question is may be uh that was the basic			
answer			
But our hostel I don't think has is an exception as 			
 Yeah 			
 It's an exception 			
Yeah 			
And if you say for that matter my hostel is fortunate in 			
fortunate enough to get uh R T uhm like you see we have			
Ah your hostel has got a lot of problems for example 			
it is two words rowdy and all then the new 			
for whose one word he started kicking off the students without 			
uh one word 			
 These problem are there 			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Problems are there problems are there what			
 I'm saying is that uh we've got an R T who does			
care about the study of the students			
Study of the students			
Yeah because if suppose you have got some problem in 			
ge getting your things done then he will come and ask 			
 okay if you have any problem just say don't hesitate and one word			
 			
I don't know no our R T doesn't do that 			
Our R T just comes once in a while shakes hand with			
all the boys then we start talking to him and he talks back we			
talk about all the to topic except the hostel topics			
 Still you people are one word 			
Yeah 			
And anything that's just 			
So yeah what do you think that just their			
target was to get uh get the two words 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah yeah that's the main thing 			
They are not interested at all in this welfare of the students 			
Why should a person care ?			
Why should he throw his family means he don't care about his family			
rather than yeah he'll come and start looking after			
boys who know very little 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah and uh what manner you people are approaching to the			
higher authorities ?			
No we've the higher authorities to just uh give			
the warden's notice they refused so we are planning to go on a			
hunger strike 			
Yeah			
Fast unto death 			
When you'll start ?			
It was supposed to start from today but the managing committee			
has asked yes that give some more time to one			
word 			
 Yes 			
 But don't you think that uh its good to uh			
 in to inform other hostelers also means some hostel one word			
 of other			
Well the other hostelers can't do anything about their own			
hostel so why should they do anything about our hostel			
 You you should just just inform that these			
people			
No that was therefore I'll tell you one thing my			
hostel is far far better from the other hostel 			
Uh ah			
Atleast jubilee there used to be a time when jubilee was like			
that but jubilee couldn't two words 			
Now police enters jubilee without much you know but in our case 			
it's impossible for the police man to enter			
But I think that uh there were people in			
jubilee case they they attracted with the hostel itself uh one			
word also and one word and they two have given some 			
some sort of uh statement in papers regarding the students 			
 Uhn 			
Well in favour of the students first of all there is one thing			
We must easily understand that whatever was happening in jubilee			
was wrong 			
That there are boys who were staying there for six seven years and			
they have never been enroll in any uh department 			
It was a matter of fact that sort of 			
 But do you do you think that this is the fault			
of the students only ?			
This is the fault of students only because 			
the students themselves			
 No no 			
Authorities I suppose			
No no no if the students uh do one thing you know 			
they can't do anything they will just keep quite			
There are two types of students one is that uh cool type			
 He'll just go on with the studies and doesn't bother about			
what yeah exactly is going around			
Other type is that type they'll just interact with those			
very hoodlums 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
Just to be on the safe side			
Yeah yeah 			
Now this is two types			
The cool type will never do anything			
And the hoodlums just doesn't keep quite			
But this			
At that time I think it is the duty of the authorities to			
just have the matter straight 			
 I've heard that jubilee people even most of the jubilee			
people I'll say appreciated it 			
Yeah			
Particularly lot of uh the many guys who were			
arrested in mid-terms 			
 No because the image so see the			
 That's important			
No			
But it never went to that			
Created in the paper			
No no no now see in our hostel that is different 			
because we realise of course there are a couple of students we just 			
mean they just seem to stay without			
Just listen this really is one very important thing			
That any uni uni university especially in post-graduate			
courses there is no clearcut I mean time limit for session 			
and so you see in hostel they will say you			
 No no no 			
There is a clearcut no time limit but 			
 then only for those people 			
 No 			
 How only somebody has got some problem in			
enrollment 			
This is its only for those people who don't have much say 			
who can't shout it's only for those			
Rules are there but they apply only to people who are			
How could people were living from six or seven years and			
nobody went and asked that these people were 			
 Because there is sort of gadbad 			
That does us that's it that does us they			
seem to take out a knife a few words 			
 No it is no because even authorities what			
 I'm saying that the authorities were were the main responsible			
persons you see 			
That they did not take care of the hostel and after that when			
somebody is dropped there and it is there 			
No			
Some personal interest that's why they 			
The authorities in the beginning for example take your 			
this Pundit was there 			
Yeah			
See what he is used to do he used to interact with			
those very people 			
And if he wanted to get somebody one word 			
going down in a very bad way 			
He used to meet them and he used to manage that			
 So he uh 			
No he was a			
But he didn't get one word in it			
He doesn't want their help because I've heard that he			
himself claim to be a goonda or something he was a 			
goonda 			
Yeah yeah that's what I'm saying			
No he is not afraid of those people 			
Yeah			
But the Pundit he because of his own act he used to			
do it			
No he			
He used to take the help of those			
He he never he never did take help			
 I've I've heard there was one chap in uh			
 jubilee who said that uh I can't do anything about uh this			
guy uh Pundit because see he has helped me he has given the hostel to			
this person who didn't have any right to the hostel he gave one word 			
to this person because of my one word 			
Uhn			
But the thing is in our case that's it if its			
okay in that case the authorities is itelf responsible unless authorities			
 one word it is not corrupt they can't do anything 			
No but you see			
And students were supported			
Students or you see a student cannot be a			
very gentleman			
 Two words 			
No no I'll tell you in my hostel there are about			
 ten boys who are sort of dadas you can say			
clearcut dadas 			
And there are other one eighty guys one seventy guys you can say			
who are this cool type			
Okay this ten people will go fifty people will be watching			
their particular programme on T V 			
And uh these ten people will go and they'll do all of			
a sudden they'll come without saying anything they will simply turn			
the channel to the particular programme they are are not 			
 Then you can thus agree it was the authorities			
were responsible there 			
 Wait wait 			
What happened is they will change programme and the fifty			
guys they'll just keep quite 			
 It's not the fault of those ten guys it is the fault of			
fifty guys who just keep quite 			
Why do they keep quite ?			
Yeah			
Okay if I want to watch that programme that is			
not my one word I have to fight for it yeah 			
otherwise I can't watch it			
 One word 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah no doubt 			
There are two things only either you join those people			
 or you fight those people 			
No there are			
And one thing about those people is when they realise that			
somebody is capable of fighting them back they will just join him they			
will just keep him in means they have very good term with him			
All the one word which is temporary you know			
controversial matter laughs 			
No no no			
But after all			
I don't think it's a controversial			
What do you think about your department infact uh about			
your study and the way they teach students here ?			
Well fine 			
Yes 			
Uhm it's okay 			
Do you think that there should be something else which should			
be included 			
No I don't think 			
I think 			
It should be			
No no department okay syllabus is also okay 			
The teachers are okay 			
And they give proper			
Only thing is that uh the avenue should be large			
Avenue should be			
Job avenues and all			
Facilities			
There is no job avenue facilities are also okay I think			
No no facilities to students and those who get get the			
degree			
Yeah			
They didn't have an opportunity			
There don't have any opportunity			
Yeah 			
Almost zero 			
 That's why no instrumnetal motivation and just			
adding one word 			
 laughs 			
A zero			
 That's very good 			
Ah don't you think that the the teachers should continue this			
department uh during late evening too ?			
That the students come			
No it is difference difference in the students I don't			
think students feel that there is any need of it 			
Yeah			
I think just two words I have been here now for I			
think three and half years and I feel it's okay 			
It depends on the students if you want to carry on studies you can			
just go to lab and study whatsoever you like and if you feel the need of			
They all think that we cannot study but they if they want to			
 co co consult			
He can he can consult I don't think there is any problem			
so far I've never faced any problem			
Whenever I feel somehow I've gone to any Professor			
and he has been very glad to help me 			
Yeah			
I feel so I don't know 			
See my name is Susheela Padmanabhan from			
Cochin 			
 I'd like to deal with agriculture in India 			
Do you ?			
 Uh 			
Yes I feel that I'm interested in too 			
agriculture 			
 Too 			
Then can you suggest to me something about 			
the development of agriculture during this age in this 			
age and this year ?			
 At this stage 			
No			
Then 			
I think so that agriculture is not more important at			
this stage due to the uhn climate uhn 			
climatic conditions uhn because I found that before			
just two months back uh just one month time uhn 			
that it was not rain raining very heavily 			
 uh see the monsoon was not that much perfect uhn 			
Actually what the crops needed uhn I feel like that			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
 Uh 			
 uhn 			
 Uh 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhn 			
Uhm 			
But now it has uh the monsoon has started uhm			
 to a middle extend I feel			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhn I'm going to talk about the			
development we want in especially in India when are 			
comparing India with other countries 			
I want to know more about the development how we can develop			
our own crops uhm 			
Now it is we are depending more more for 			
 on othe other countries we are depending now a			
days uhm 			
But I want to have idea how we can develop our agriculture			
in India with our own efforts 			
How we can keep our own crops means now a days that uh			
biological experiments are going on ahn and we are totally			
 changing our crops all this uh biological experiments we are			
grafting we are taking other crops uh to develop it			
more and more to uhm produce more size uhn uhm that you			
 may be knowing 			
 Countries 			
 Uhm 			
 More 			
 Uhm 			
 Efforts 			
 Ahn 			
 Uh 			
 Uhm 			
But uh			
But I feel uhn you told me about the crop 			
 uhm much depends upon the soil 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhm 			
Soil 			
Soil 			
Uhn 			
Okay each one soil differs uhm and each			
one chemical fertilizers differ			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Chemicals were being used uhm for growing the			
crops			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
I feel like that			
Uhm uhm 			
If they depend on the high quality chemicals uhm 			
then the crops will grow better uhm I feel like that way 			
 uhn and if they use uh just rough materials uhm I			
don't think the crops will grow uhm grow uhm 			
means this all depends on the materials uhm what they use			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhn 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm but my opinion is know uhm			
 if we don't use chemicals ah also haan			
 we can uh keep our crops when we are during uh 			
twenty-five years back we are not much depending on the chemicals			
 uhm we are using that cowdung			
 I think 			
 Uhm 			
 Ah 			
 Haan 			
 Twenty-five years back ahn 			
 Uhm 			
Cowdung and all			
We are using that one word uhn waste			
 Uhn 			
Waste materials			
Waste materials uhm with that no if we 			
 continues continue that only we can uh keep the			
fertility of the soil and we can keep the taste of that			
 uh vegetable or fruits 			
Now a days we are not getting that taste which we			
were enjoying twenty-five years back			
 Uhm 			
 Of the soil uhm 			
 But 			
Uhm 			
That taste is different and now a days is uh			
 taste is quite different			
 Different 			
 But now 			
What you know but now a days uhm they are			
using all the superior materials uhm because of that only the			
taste is going I see in olden days they used to use all old			
methods uhm now new methods have been started			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 I see 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Like uh that uh different types of water facilities			
and all			
Uhm 			
Due to that also and especially they use this different types			
of chemicals what they use			
Uhn 			
Rough chemicals			
Uhn 			
In olden days what they used to use that cowdung manure 			
 uhn and different types of soil			
 Uhn 			
Uhm 			
But now those soil also are not available I			
 think due to the uh this uh poverty and due to the			
soil is not levelled 			
 Uhn 			
 That soil I know want 			
Soil is not levelled here na 			
 Ahn 			
Uhm I want to uhm have an idea uhm 			
whether we can go to the olden days agriculture is it useful to our			
 Uhm 			
Yes but I think so few of them follow this method 			
 uhm few of them not to use the one word they don't			
 laughs even know use of the			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
I want 			
I feel like that			
Yeah yeah 			
What is my opinion is no ah we can have the			
olden methods ah but in a modern type			
 Ah 			
 Ah 			
Way ah			
 In modern way 			
 Ah modern way 			
See uh dripping uh wat irrigation			
system we can use			
 Irrigation system 			
Yeah 			
And we can use this uh waste material of our things			
 what this uh waste of vegetables and leaves and we			
must keep in that uh cowdung cowdung and uh bio 			
 Waste kya hota hai 			
 Vegetables leaves and all 			
 Cowdung 			
Bio gas 			
Bio it is not bio gas			
 Gas is also bio 			
This bio means 			
Manure manure			
Manure bio manure			
Ah that cowdung if we waste uh which is decayed and we			
can keep those uh give those manure and uh that system we can 			
if we use no that taste the quality everything			
 If follows 			
Uhm			
Now what we are eating no just a waste 			
 It is just of a grass it is I			
feel			
 It is 			
Uhn it is quite harmful after your years uh the			
Americans will only will prove that it is a poisonous thing after using			
this chemicals and all no you will become a uh this uh harmful only for			
our health 			
My opinion is that if we go to our olden days but in a modern			
way modern type type of irrigation or 			
irrigation we can use for dripping and all that is quite convinient 			
and useful for us ah 			
But manure which we use now a days we can change			
If we change that system of manure and if if we			
concentrate on this agriculture we can have our own India which 			
the Gandhiji			
 Type 			
 Yeah 			
 Ah 			
Had started			
Dreamt dreamt I would say			
It is not materialised			
 Dreamt 			
Uhn 			
It is only a dream of Gandhi 			
If everyone uh instead of running beh uh 			
after this jobs and services and industries			
If we use our own India our own land for our			
agriculture purpose we need not depend on other countries for 			
food uhm that is my opinion 			
And from let it be we got small poor or rich if we			
concentrate our aim on this agriculture we need not depend on others			
and we can have our own things so 			
And uh this uhm my uh aim is know if we use all this			
without using chemicals more if we use natural manure it is quite			
good for our health for the taste uh that in India it			
is possible 			
 Dream of our Gandhi 			
 Taking uh 			
 India 			
 Food 			
 Ah yes natural manure 			
 Possible in in other countries it is not			
possible but in India it is possible uhm because it is each			
one in uh we actually we Indians uhm use different 			
old things only uhm old material old manure all these			
things 			
Many villages are using this type of old things so their			
crops are growing I feel like that way			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Growing but uh 			
Now it has some no that			
 But 			
Due to the temperatures no uhm due to the			
monsoons also uhm and due to the it depends how much			
 ma manure and all the this soil uhm mostly it			
depends upon the soil 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm that is depend on the rain 			
 That is the and rain soil			
Uhm soil 			
And different types of manure uhm when			
these three things are used or levelled uhm when they are			
 put in a proper order uhm I feel there is no harm			
in agriculture 			
That is no harm in growing the crops uhm but			
these things must be in a right order I feel I feel like this 			
 uhm uhm uh okay because all these three must three			
things must come in a right line then only you I feel that we			
can grow agriculture			
But I found some of them even though they are means even in			
their house they have a small crop they grow uh haan			
 kitchen garden 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Okay 			
 Uhm garden 			
 Kitchen garden we can			
They do they even if there is no rain uhm			
 they just try to uhm store water for the crops to grow			
What they are making for their own livelihood 			
uhm for their own purpose uhm I feel like that way 			
Now some people are doing like that way uhm 			
simply keep on buying buying then it is no means actually first			
of all it is one word 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Means there is some kind of satisfaction 			
 yeah at the time same time we are 			
 Yeah 			
 And you can say no that we are			
 have done our own with our efforts 			
uhm I feel like that way			
 Making our 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
Because we ourself are doing there uhm in our			
place uhm different types of uh this beans and all			
 uhm we have done			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
And it is growing uhm but we are doing 			
 uhm when there is no rain uhm we are putting			
 laughs we are storing one word for the water and all 			
 uhm like that way when we get proper sunlight 			
uhm heat soil monsoon all these things 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Now a days uh so many uh this inventions			
are there uhm we can heat we need not uh depend on sun now			
a days 			
If gardens are there we can ke uh keep the heat with			
the proper want those inventions are going on yeah and we			
can keep those heat temperature I mean			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
Temperature and all			
Temperature water we can give in time how			
much water that crop need 			
 Yeah exact 			
 Ah that only I feel all these when 			
you are have given everything in time know 			
 uhm I think so then and India will become a prosperous			
country uhm in agriculture uhm then all			
these three things if they are looked after well uhm I			
feel that way uhm 			
Even if there is no water uhm we can bring water			
from some dam storage or bring from anywhere and we can			
 cultivate the land 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah yeah 			
And the cultivation is more 			
 Most important			
Essential now 			
We can produce manufacture the 			
machines with the use of that mechanical technology technology with			
technology we can produce manufacture this machine			
But agriculture is we depend on other countries this uh			
inflation will go high high and uh it is not our 			
one word to meet all this expenses 			
After all uh 			
 High 			
 One word 			
There is some			
An Indian			
Uhm 			
Means we have to depend fully on agriculture and we have			
to develop our land 			
We have to develop our cro crops 			
And in such a way that it is useful for the ordinary man			
Man 			
Common man can do this agriculture if all this uhm uh			
Materials and all the soil 			
 What is needed that if it is given we can			
cultivate the land properly uh and our uh people also			
should be very hard working 			
And especially			
 Land properly 			
 Hard working 			
Hard working makes more ah man yeah			
 uh ha happier life yeah I feel like that way			
 Ah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Uhn 			
When once you are hard working in your work what you do 			
 uhm you will gain for what you have done yeah in the			
end			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah and for health of the old man or medium man			
Yeah			
If we start the agriculture no I I don't mean that it should			
go on the large scale if it is			
Just you start from the small scale			
 Large scale 			
You may have heard no			
 Haan yeah			
Even one drops make a a sea ocean			
 Sea 			
Yeah 			
How was the day today ?			
For me not very well it's been like usual 			
What happened ?			
Today also I faced the same problem with tenth standard 			
What was the problem ?			
These children though they are in tenth standard they are			
not very serious about their studies 			
They keep on talking mostly the back benchers 			
And there are some students who come from the aff 			
influential families yeah they also trouble the others 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Yeah 			
Actually because we can't say anything we can't do to this people			
These children because they have their business and all that			
they are not more interested in studies and all that			
 Yeah 			
They might be thinking that we carry the same			
business			
 Keep on troubling yeah 			
Yeah 			
So no need for study actually I've heard one of the boy no			
 actually he said that sir I have my father's 			
business I just come here see to pass my time 			
 See 			
Yes one word 			
So he is troubling the others 			
Yeah their parents should be called but			
 That's why the others 			
The parent should be called and			
Actually now we are going to call the parents you know after			
the first unit test result uhm so we'll call them			
 we'll talk with them 			
 Uhm 			
Their parents come and sign the results no 			
Ah actually the parents no we have not still			
given			
But the students for they have been troubling not only me			
other teachers also lot of time			
So from them we had taken in written writing			
 that they will never do such a thing and twice or thrice they			
did the same thing 			
But still we find their behaviour the same way			
No change 			
They themselves have given in written writing 			
 when we reported to sir and madam 			
They said that okay we are giving in writing that we'll			
 not trouble any teacher we'll be serious about our studies			
 			
But the same thing we find still they are troubling			
 Or they would be given by 			
 Even I face the same problem 			
When I punish the student their parents come and ask me why			
you punished the student 			
They don't want punishment to be given to their children and			
they don't			
 They'll take the side of their children 			
 And they want uh only benefit means like			
making them uh improvements in their writings and			
Yeah actually when the child is doing something wrong			
 then also you should not punish and uh			
 Yeah they should study 			
Yeah even if they get zero we have to grant them anyhow 			
marks			
Yeah actually no they			
They won't study 			
Because of the parents attitude no we find even the 			
childrens children behave the same way			
The students when we try to			
Yeah they take it lightly			
Say something			
Yeah it is 			
 It is of their benefit they don't listen 			
Yeah benefit they don't understand the			
meaning of benefit I think 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah actually now a days			
Keep on just uh doing that whatever they want in their 			
Yeah actually now a days we find mostly earlier the parents			
were not like this 			
Yeah first they used to ask 			
 They used to say beat us 			
Yeah 			
But make the student			
Even I find so many sa 			
But now a days the parents have just become the opposite			
Yeah 			
Now they say don't beat the children even if they are doing			
something wrong don't do anything 			
Even now the now a days parents emphasise no 			
that my child is sick everytime yeah and he doesn't eat			
properly he keeps on playing if uh they will say this all 			
 but they won't say that ki ma make			
him uh beat him or make him do whatever you want never			
 But they they have to pass 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah actually now a days especially we find earlier it was			
different			
During our time our parents they used to come and tell the			
teacher			
Yeah we know how we have studied			
Yeah yeah but now today you find the situation			
totally different			
The parents they encourage the children			
 Yeah 			
Encourage means they won't be uh looking at			
what they are doing			
But if they have been			
 Not to be beaten 			
In these things only they are encouraging			
 If this happens no 			
Teacher beats the child yeah they will come to			
fight 			
They will come till to the Principal 			
then they have to			
 Yeah 			
Yeah see we teacher have to			
And every time they've to scold us 			
And that's the thing			
That is the problem with me also 			
Even I face the same problem but I try to tackle it you know			
with uh I've got some problems whenever I have 			
Actually not in this earlier school no I had problems like this			
most of the students no they are just like hooligans and all that			
Yeah 			
Become since I've dealt successfully with some of			
the children			
See if we love them if we pamper a little 			
 You had to do that na that is			
yeah			
No if we pamper them little			
Yeah 			
But sometimes no we have to go out of our way 			
yeah for these childrens especially though others they will think			
that the teacher is going out of the way means we have to give them many			
means whatever at first they have not done home work 			
 Yeah 			
 Some punishment is required 			
No actually at first no for these children no we should not			
give punishment 			
We should pamper them a lot			
 Then try to make them understand			
 Yeah because they understand 			
Ah now now			
Once they come closer to us no then only we understand			
Now in the tenth standard they are grown up			
They understand the meaning of punishment			
Yes			
They feel some shameful about that punishment			
 No actually I'll tell you 			
Yeah			
They are not ashamed I'll tell you because once 			
when we took from them in writing the next time they did the same			
thing			
So when madam came to the class she punished the whole class 			
And then means to make them that whatever they are doing they			
were standing on the bench to make ashamed we send eighth standard			
students just go and have a look at them			
And you know what was the remark of tenth standard what's			
 to us let them come and see 			
Means that was their reaction 			
So they were not bothered 			
 Two words 			
Yeah that was their reaction when this eighth standard			
students they came in class there no reaction they didn't			
felt ashamed nothing like that			
 In even my class 			
Though they are small they are very clever 			
Clever in the sense uh not in studies at all but			
Uh they are doing co-curricular activities and			
all that			
 One word 			
Yeah beating and everything and using and abuses that			
don't know what they are saying sometimes			
Actually what's the thing you know the parents they			
don't respect the teacher so the students also don't respect			
 Yeah in our cla 			
Class I can make out what the parent might be			
speaking 			
 Because at time you see even the parents when			
they speak about the teacher in derogative manners			
Yeah yeah 			
So the children learns the same thing			
Same thing and so we have to just shut			
them and nothing			
 That's the state 			
Yeah now a days the situation has just become so			
different that uh we have to bear even whatever they say			
I never beat a student never in my whole life 			
I've never beat a single student but now when I came to 			
third standard I can see that uh they are something different because			
they are never means uh guided in a way to how to behave or how to			
talk with a teacher atleast 			
Whenever we are uh saying something they without thinking			
they say out the words now			
 Even I never beat 			
Without thinking what are the words			
 Yeah 			
Yeah and whatever I've written on the board they			
take out the meanings of that but don't understand what is the question what			
is the answer for that never 			
But take out other meanings from that means			
how clever they are mean uh means unwanted things they			
are clever			
 Other one word 			
 Yes 			
Yeah actually that's the thing suppose 			
they'll always see what's the mistake teacher is doing			
Yeah 			
They pronounce one word 			
 Not even that if that were			
Always they will be uh what's the teacher 			
one word 			
I will uh give marks for the student if he takes out my			
mistake but they don't even take that much of pains to one			
word 			
 That is they try no always they try			
Suppose the teacher is writing the chalk is not proper 			
it's not writing			
 Laughs 			
Yeah			
Yeah it's making sound and all they			
 It's a funny idea 			
Yeah they will start laughing and all that			
Yeah even we feel one word they will keep on			
saying			
They are very particular about these things laughs 			
When you ask them question the whole class			
Never even I can make out only few students 			
 yeah those coming in five firstly I think those			
only will give the answers everytime ahn yeah and even			
during inspection and all they only are very active and particular			
Their parents do come and meet me but yeah 			
uh about others maximum I can find that I can give the examples 			
These students never never bothered			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah actually even I two words 			
But their parents whenever I beat them the parents came			
and ask me purposely why 			
And the same parents said unnecessarily you beat my child			
 Even for me the other teachers first only they			
warned me yeah that don't beat these these these child 			
because as I'm new no they told me 			
Because if you will beat even if they have done something 			
wrong 			
 Yeah 			
 But we feel about them no something			
No action will be taken against that you will be the 			
person to be blamed 			
So the parents will come and they will blame you only 			
 Blames means uh we have to take the blame 			
sometimes			
We have to take the blame on that 			
I feel about that only			
Not sometime most of the time we have to take 			
 Most of the time means yes that is true 			
But uh sometime for these students also we feel yeah			
 even madam has told me that some students are such you don't beat			
them			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
But I feel somewhere if these are to be guided just now			
 this is the way			
See I had a show-down with yeah one of the			
boy no tenth standard			
I had a show-down			
 Yeah 			
Now tenth is a			
And then I told them okay because			
 he argued with me like anything as I was means equal to him			
 One word 			
 One word 			
Ah			
That way he argued with me so I said I will not enter the			
class till he says sorry to me			
I came back I didn't went to that class for two three days 			
Then madam interfered that boy was called and he said sorry			
Even when he said sorry he was crying then I told him I			
made him understand see I'm not happy making you say sorry to me			
 That's not the thing but you should means respect me as a			
teacher			
 I'm elder to you I'm not equal to you			
You can't talk me just like you talk to your friends or your			
younger ones			
You can't talk to a teacher like that way			
So I made him understand nahi 			
that			
But now a days I find him but it has one word 			
 Nahi 			
Don't speak that way but atleast he should be			
clever 			
 No actually what the thing you know 			
Somewhere			
You know what the student they tell no at home they don't			
treat us like this 			
If we shout at him no means this very particular boy when I			
shouted at him no to other teacher he said at home nobody shouts			
at me 			
So what			
That means we have to behave just the way their parents			
behave at home			
Yeah parents behave and uh parents should come			
to know			
 They expect the same behaviour 			
But how can we behave that way			
You would have called the parents you would have called			
the parents 			
No actually he himself said sorry 			
 one word actually I find yes			
 Because this is not proper 			
 But we should actually 			
Now a days I find him little bit one word he			
scores he pays attention 			
Yours is tenth so it is nice but uh we said that 			
 So it is yeah			
We can't help out means whatever the way their behaviour 			
 yeah we have to deal with you have to make make them understand			
and one word 			
But in our class what happens being a third standard we			
 one word should guide 			
 Yeah 			
 No actually no there has to be a communication			
with the students and the teacher I I find that I have a gap with my			
students 			
Yeah because			
I cannot have a proper communication with them			
That is true 			
 That's why no we can't understand			
Neither they understand me and I also can't understand them			
That happens with every teacher and yeah 			
 Yeah that's the thing and if once we			
have this no full communication with one other two way communication			
 then only we can say that 			
So how is your uh means uh son ?			
How is 			
Your daughter how is your daughter ?			
Daughter is my daughter's name is Aloka she is

Nice and by that way by the way we understand no how to			
learn teach properly to the K G students no			
 Books 			
Uhm 			
Even uh usually we start by uh A B C D means uh			
 direct writing but it is actually we have to teach them the strokes			
 and even pictures we have to draw by that they will uh uh means			
understand how we have to write how to			
But really it			
Sleeping lines standing and all that			
But you teach the students 			
Where ?			
In your programme in your course			
No we just have to prepare the journals and			
thereafter 			
 But it is just like something like the postal			
same like the postal one			
 Haan yeah			
So you can get the experience			
Uhn 			
In our postal course we have to go to the some school and			
teach them and then they will give you certificate uhn from			
that school			
 Uhn 			
Okay 			
Then I have to submit that certificate to the 			
Certificate			
From where I did this postal course			
Okay 			
This is the very uh aid			
Uhn 			
But that way we will get the experience ahn 			
how to teach them and how students can encourage 			
 Ahn 			
No I think there may uh there may be such thing 			
that we have to take the classes but now as I am working here means			
working as a teacher then it will be not necessary to attend again			
further class			
Yeah			
Uh school or classes so uh even uh I mean uh 			
have completed the project and that journal and craft also 			
This Saturday I think one lecture is there

They will give			
Yeah institutional uh uhm one word 			
And now your when is your exams ?			
Exams may be uh month of uh October last week or in			
the month of November in the first week 			
So I have to whatever I may be I had to prepare ready for			
the exam study hard have to study hard			
Now we have to study			
Yeah 			
In the postal course also we have to study a lot			
Yeah			
We have to refer only one word to one word			
Uhn too many things we have to do			
But its only that we can do in our convenience			
You can do it 			
 It's not that we have to do one			
section today			
 Uhn 			
And uh by this only every Saturday classes and we			
have the course 			
So I think in Ganpati also I too much tired and uh I'm			
 suffering from cold and fever 			
And yesterday I went to doctor for uh for this and uh 			
even cough was is also there 			
My younger daughter also suffering from cold cough 			
very horrible 			
Only last week my father-in-law was not feeling well			
my mother-in-law was suffering one word 			
And my younger daughter also uhn one word 			
 otherwise you can			
 Uhn 			
Yeah now no they are going to uh take the			
Yeah yeah 			
Collect Laukik no today rickshaw is not there so they			
came his teacher so means uh I had to go early no one word 			
 One word 			
 Yes Yesterday we were we were having bissi			
 for for all our all of our society member			
This year also 			
Yeah twenty members are there 			
And how many uh rupees ?			
Uh hundred rupees we are collecting means			
totally two thousand we'll take out two names and			
then distribute the amount uh to two two members 			
Then we have to prepare tea and biscuits 			
Biscuits			
Yeah 			
I have also bissis two hundred 			
rupees a bissi 			
Yeah 			
Then we have to means uh that prepare some heavy 			
fo food means pau bhaji ah and all			
that uh bissi and twenty rupees bissi			
 and there are fifteen ladies are there			
 Ah 			
Okay 			
So you will get three thousand rupees if			
you get them one word 			
Means uh twenty ladies means uh meeting each other			
 its very nice no			
Nice 			
So and there only is one word 			
In Pratibha Nagar also there are uh bissi			
 but I didn't take part 			
I had to well after my second delivery I didn't take 			
But it is very difficult to maintain two two bissis			
The bissi was fully programmed uhn			
 so it was in our home			
 Uhn 			
Means it may be of uh that breakfast also there			
Yeah but when it is in our home it is a very big we			
have to prepare some one word 			
Uh			
 One word food na 			
Yeah 			
And what is your idea about taking uh uh means English talking			
classes ?			
What is your idea about English talking classes is there no 			
I don't no because I have no idea how they will teach and 			
it is it is uh school onwards I didn't get			
Ahn 			
I don't have and I don't have experience 			
Because so many will go uh			
No but that is that is another thing			
Because so many			
One book is there no Rapidex			
Rapidex English speaking course no it is also			
nice uh but uh			
 That is a 			
The same thing if we can read the book in sometime 			
we'll go to class			
Uhn 			
The same result only this conversation is not there 			
So many will uh rush to the classes but I think 			
classes is not uh proper because English speaking means it will come			
by practice yeah yeah I think so			
 Yeah yeah 			
Hello my name is uh Biradar 			
Hello I'm Mrs Mamta Raybage 			
And we are having a discussion on todays children and Maths 			
So sir what you feel about uh todays children how they are in			
Maths ?			
Uh childrens are okay depends upon there coach 			
Coach means they should be coached from when they are in			
nursery U K G itself 			
The basic of maths should be taught to them means they			
should be taught in a funful way about the numbers 			
They should be introduced to the numbers 			
So that they'll make make might be uh good in Maths			
when they go in the higher classes 			
Uh then it became this uh good 			
So then it became nice only otherwise they'll didn't			
follow what is Maths 			
No means uh I wanted to say that uh they			
should be taught the basics of Maths			
Now I teach in fourth fifth and sixth seventh standard			
maths 			
The children are not quite good in Maths 			
But why they are not quite good ?			
What do you think what more something else should be done			
 so that there Maths will become perfect 			
Uh suddenly it will be become perfect only 			
So it depend upon that uh their environment 			
And even home did condition also 			
If they be in always that this is one word there are 			
 not improve no improvement only 			
No means they don't know			
No here I will not uh that think that students are very			
weak 			
Actually they are good only 			
Uh if suppose sometimes if they will not ge get good			
 uhm diagrams or 			
I see what actually I feel			
All the types only 			
But even the bases uhm for example write in numbers			
 write in figures which they are taught from first standard			
even uhm still they reach the fifth standard they don't			
know even the basics 			
 Uhm 			
So what we call to it here uh I Q some students			
having different different I Q 			
So some some of them if you told one time they are going to 			
uh understand quick and some of them 			
For three years sir they are going in the same programme 			
say from first second third fourth 			
Ah 			
And till four years a child normal child take any			
normal child if he doesn't know the difference between thousand and			
ten thousands and crore 			
Atleast the basic should be good of maths that is why			
 if the basics are not at all proper how can they uh do the eighth			
ninth and tenth standard sums 			
Addition subtractions are the basics 			
So what do you think about that ?			
What else efforts should be done ?			
No I'm asking you because			
Uhn that means here actually they must do more practice			
By doing more uhm either sums either that uh writing so			
they are going to improve			
 No uh 			
For example take seventh standard 			
 I'm teaching there Maths but I take each and every sum			
on the board			
I make the students do the sum on the board but uh I			
finished my portion in ten to fifteen days earlier 			
I take revision but still there are failures in Maths 			
So you being a higher uh this teacher I'm asking you			
 you give me a the guidence on how should I			
prepare the students for Maths ?			
Because I'm taking fifth sixth seventh for the first time			
Maths so you give me a the guidence so that			
 na let the number of student failing be less 			
I teach my best because I take each and every sum on the			
board I make them solve on the board I take tests also I take revision also			
What else should I do ?			
One week I go on with only four to five lessons I have done 			
So what guidence you may give for that 			
 No by doing more practice we can improve			
otherwise only that one time it is not possible 			
Means what else should I take ?			
 I'll take tests also 			
I have to take make them I keep I competitions			
between the girls and the boys also			
 Ah ha 			
 I 			
Ah so if it uh if you teach that is in one day 			
So you can take out there again give the same sums 			
All type of students some normal medium and uh			
extraordinary 			
The extraordinary they are going to take up quick only 			
And uh med medium class they can't understand soon 			
And you join with that one that uh brilliant one that medium			
 and so they are going to that means one by one they are going to discuss			
And suddenly they are going to improve 			
And we must do uh like before that you told that regarding			
competition uhm that is essential competition that 			
 Uhm 			
No because I take competition between girls and the boys			
I make one boy solve if he doesn't no I make one girl solve 			
Let the competition spirit be between the both			
But even though in for having such a lot of efforts on them 			
still in their paper they have done nil might be my paper was hard			
 because I didn't 			
Ah now 			
And I don't trust in giving the paper sums for revision 			
Papers we can't say hard only because they already taught			
that same 			
No same matter I have taught only just I have I jumbled up			
the numbers here and there 			
All the sums were there in the text book itself but still they			
have not done properly in the exam 			
Now what else guidence should I give because 			
 this week 			
 Ah that 			
 In that case we 			
In that case you must improve their writing only 			
Writing and uh uh exercise 			
 Means they do the same exercise in classwork			
they do the same exercise at homework 			
They do it on the board also 			
Means what do you think that the basic itself is not good or			
 now they are getting interest in maths 			
No by doing these all uh that means taking uh test			
and uh that this way they are going to improve and we can't say within			
that one month either this two month they are going 			
 Not one month now two to three months have			
become the school has started we finished our first unit test also 			
No afterwards that they are impro going to improve			
suddenly laughs so step by step 			
Our fifth standard also is giving problem 			
Do you know even they write one word 			
Not even that fifth standard so all the side even			
higher classes also the same problem 			
Even if we've given many times they can't understand 			
and if once one time if they understood they are going to tell soon			
they are going to understand 			
When after that one week either two weeks leave they can't 			
 again the excercise because that means uh			
 They'll have one word 			
Then			
Uh repetition is not there			
When we left other that four five days we even that it			
is uh we can't tell express our views one word 			
But how come we will be every time doing the same thing 			
We have to complete our portion within time isn't it ?			
And again hammering the same and same and same sums we should			
complete our portion also			
We should have all the revision also 			
How is it possible sir ?			
So in only one week daily we must do one one sum 			
on that all exercise 			
Sir we are having only half an hour period sir how come its			
 uh possible to do because in one week time we're having			
seven period of maths isn't it ?			
Uhn			
And in seven period atleast we should complete two to three			
excercises in seven period 			
One exercise teaching and doing the excercises and their			
homework and their classwork then assignments are also there 			
And completing this much is impossible sir			
Everytime to do one exercise one sum na of			
each exercise 			
Even it is not possible by even in school also			
But in home parents they must take interest 			
That is the main thing na here that			
would again the main thing that they don't take at all interest in the			
 their children at all 			
If both husband and wife are working husband should do 			
No both not only husband			
He should help na laughs 			
He should help in their 			
 Because if they are working both they must			
do both 			
And it is not possible uhm either that uh one side only			
Either husband or wife who who is getting that			
But no sir when			
Time			
When both of them reach home okay the first thing is the			
wife should get up and make tea for her husband why ?			
 It's not like that that 			
 No that is not rule			
No no no			
No			
 It's like that sir 			
Never a husband says that I'll make a cup of tea			
okay you sit I'll make a cup of tea never he says everytime			
a wife should get up and make 			
Both works same hours isn't it ?			
Both of them are uh earning ah both of them are			
earning for the same house			
 Ah I 			
Okay it depend upon that even that wife also 			
If she did no smoothly one time two time he is going to observe			
 and why if she she prepared and she can't give that daily I'm			
 preparing this way that way uh if if she started like that only			
saying then he will never do 			
Husband no I'll do I'll prepare it			
If she told and uh suddenly no with you so I'll 			
prepare he is going to say that 			
It depend upon their that uh 			
But I don't think that any husband is willingly			
saying that that I'll come to okay you sit for			
a while I'll uh prepare a cup of tea for you 			
Indian husbands don't think like that you see so			
 No no it depend upon that 			
 No no don't don't two words 			
Uh not Indian husband that depend upon that uh one			
word woman 			
No no 			
It also depends upon the atmosphere in which they live 			
because when husbands don't see their fathers working they also don't			
work in the house 			
My husband doesn't work at all 			
He never prepares a cup of tea he never does anything 			
Sir sir you prepare tea ?			
Oh yes yes laughter I prepared as			
So your wife is quite lucky na having you as			
a husband sir laughs 			
No that uh here was that uhm understand between both the			
 husband and wife 			
And even she is helping that all at my 			
In what ?			
Uh that uh in home even uh one word she is also			
engaged in that uh regarding home uh uh two words this way			
 so we two we help in that she is also get relax 			
 No but they say na even now			
 for example take that the husband doesn't work at all okay the			
boys one word doesn't work at all			
And then he gets married okay and he works 			
And that time the in-laws start blaming that ahn when you get			
married you start working this and that and he stops 			
Like that is also they do 			
It may depend upon their parents 			
No but why do the uh husbands again change a lot ?			
They never change 			
They change sir how come you say like that 			
When everytime you're no it is not possible for your			
husband okay to do the work			
He is also tired we are also tired isn't it ?			
So for this we say sometime to do something 			
I don't think that he says generally yes come on			
 I'll do it 			
Some once in a while once in a blue moon they help they say			
that okay okay I'll do but regularly a woman			
have to work in the kitchen isn't it ?			
Actually that is Indian concept what you say that uh uh			
that you'll that man that one word that			
Okay okay Indian culture says that women should work 			
 yeah isn't it ?			
She should cook she should look after the children it's 			
alright 			
But even if they women is are working			
as much as a man she is earning the same uh monthly saving as a			
man itself 			
Then why should he not work at home ?			
Isn't it the ego of the man in which I'm trying			
to one word 			
 Yeah 			
 No he must work if they are working both the			
side both husband and even she is getting the same equivalent to him			
And there is no difference between a husband and wife because that			
 that two are equal weight only 			
But they don't think na Indian society never			
thinks that man and woman are equal 			
Ninety-nine percent of them say that women even if she works for			
the whole day she has to look after the kitchen only alone laughs			
But don't you think that they are uh changing now 			
This is changing			
That only I'm saying sir but not uh only sir			
 might be in a society seventy-eight percent sir or the in-laws			
say that two words 			
See for example uh my wife uhm I mean			
I do a lot of cooking uhm I enjoy it that's all			
But then now that I've become a little old <{3			
 uhm I feel it is difficult to do			
See I do my one word in the department uh I do my			
work and when I come back in the evening 			
And when I feel very tired I may even sleep 			
So now I'm sixty-five sixty-two now 			
But then you know when I was young I used to go uh I			
mean my wife she does not work 			
She has not work but she had four children 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uh let me try with myself 			
 I'm Dr Mrs Parekar			
I am working here as lecturer from five years in the department			
of History			
And let me her introduce herself			
Myself Dr Padmaja Patil 			
Uh working in the department of History from uh eight to			
nine years			
Uh sometimes as a research assistant and afterwards that is from			
from four years			
 I'm working as a lecturer in the department of history 			
She is very close friend of mine sir uh			
And here is different uh in our to the opinion no opinion			
but if she says sir that is she is uh all they are living in the 			
one word 			
And I'm living in the Dhule area so laughter 			
No if give different in friendship sir			
 No no 			
It is not making but it is uh uh giving some uh			
alternate shape to thinking			
I think so no ?			
Uh because there are so many problems in uh villages			
That I'm same we are working in same place			
 			
 That's very good oh 			
But there are so many different problems and so many different			
thinking 			
Uh in that different categories and different social views sir 			
And she will talk about something no ?			
No apart from that we are good friends na 			
 Nai that's not a problem			
 And no she came from different background I came			
from another background uh 			
But still on some problem specially women problem 			
 haan this is the very current and controversial issue in			
this country uhm we know			
But considering that point our views are equal our views are			
similar I think uhm 			
So uh 			
Let us talk on anything because we are friends in that context 			
 uh 			
So uh for let us start from this department uhm			
Here uh you are teaching so many papers no ?			
So out of that which paper do you like to teach more ?			
 Uh 			
 Haan 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uh 			
 Uhm 			
I want to like because uh my specialisation in Modern India			
Uhm			
And I want to study it and I want to dis discover			
out some research work on the Modern Indian History uhm 			
mainly on the uh problems of women			
And recently there was some uh women problems and there is uh women			
policy uh that is uh declared by government of Maharashtra			
And there are so many problems related to the village woman			
particularly			
And these women uh village women are not knowing anything about			
it			
Now because of it			
 Uhm 			
Just just a minute			
Uhm			
Uh I'm interested to know whether in your			
syllabus the paper which you are teaching uhm Modern Indian			
History is there any topic which has been uh recommended 			
 uhm by the committee specially based on women problems ?			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Yes			
There are a all in all Indian history from Ancient to			
Modern yes there are one topic uhm in			
every paper			
In Ancient Indian History in Medieval Indian History in the uh			
Peshwa period or we can say in Maratha period yes yes and			
also in the uh Modern Indian History			
But in modern Indian history specially it was concentrated that is			
their development and social movement in nineteen century women problem in			
Maharashtra all over India			
In Bengal movement and there was Young one word movement			
coming from England			
And the Rajaram Mohan Roy it's progress			
And then he was discussing thinking his views on that			
And that uh topic is here in the Modern Indian History			
 Yes 			
 Uhm 			
 Yes yes 			
Okay it means you think that as the topic has been included			
here 			
So our students they will learn			
They will come to know about the problems of women in India 			
 uh 			
But do you think that these uh problem of Indian women			
especially uh 			
It has its roots right from ancient period because I'm 			
teaching Ancient Indian History			
And I'm interested in it			
So when we start from the age of Vedas uhm or			
more than that if we uh goes back to much earlier period no doubt 			
Indian history goes back to much earlier period 			
But right from the age of Ri Rigveda I have ample			
truth that the status of women or the position of women uh it has been			
fixed uh			
 Manhje though the people say that in the age			
of Rigveda we don't get secondary status of women or like that but I			
don't agree with them 			
 Manhje though there are references to 			
Gadgi and Maitreyi and 			
So many women those who are uh tho 			
those uh got the opportunity to learn			
But apart from that in uh considering with Vedic sacrifices and			
all other things I feel that status of women was secondary			
And Vedic age was a base manhje when we come			
to modern Indian history or modern civi uh how			
complex is history			
 Uh 			
 Uh 			
 Uhm 			
 Maitri yeah 			
 Women's status 			
 No that was uh 			
Medieval Indian history also			
Yeah			
Because of the invasion of the Moghals			
No I know very little about Medieval period 			
 During that time also there was also supression			
of woman because of the that that is the invasion of Moghals in			
India and that was mainly on in north India because they invaded			
south Afghanistan and two words because that impact was on north			
India mainly			
That was not in south India			
So there was so many other societies which were women apart			
from other field			
No doubt there are some impact on all religions on caste and on			
this religion			
They were started the purdah system 			
uhm not giving exhibition to the women and during that in the home only			
not giving outside them permission to go outside			
That was the same thing in Medieval period			
And when there was started Modern Indian History and then new ideas			
came from West 			
Therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who			
were taken the modern Indian education that is not English education			
And because of there was something strange in nineteen century			
And that was concentrated in our syllabus only			
Okay in this way we have added all these things in our			
syllabus uhm that our student manhje 			
 uhm our syllabus had been constructed in this manner			
That right from ancient period to modern period the students			
should have a link link manhje 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Link 			
What is the development of one's 			
 Haan when we talk on once			
 Haan 			
When we talk on or linking between the development of			
women from ancient to modern till now 			
And they have concentrated			
They have to work on that research or anything			
Or thinking because uh historian or any man living in this			
time thinking about the ancient period and he is linking the scene between			
the things happened on the human behaviour			
Or the development of human behaviour 			
That is most important thing also 			
 Yeah yeah 			
No considering uhm this syllabus we are 			
 uhm uhm quite satisfied uhm but uh have			
you seen recently the various types of advertisements on the T V and			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 There are so many advertisements			
 Haan but considering that I feel that			
 uh we are deliberately making haan 			
 the status of women secondary			
 Haan 			
 Women 			
 Haan 			
Means how the standard of uh women has been exposed			
there I don't like this			
That is the commercial purpose no ?			
In commercial purpose every company or every advertising expose a			
bit thinking only benefit of their product			
 Manhje for every			
And because of that because of they are doing and we are			
permitting them always because one lady has even that uh photo copies			
no ?			
Yeah manhje 			
That is why our main impulsion we are giving we			
are also contributing them			
 That is very recently that 			
Madhu Sapre is that			
 Indirectly 			
Madhu Sapre is one of the representative of us 			
No doubt she is a model			
No after all laughs 			
But she is representing us no 			
Although expressing 			
 We can't change yeah we can't			
change her views though she afterward thinking about that I'm 			
not doing it purposefully and that is 			
But that is purpose commercial she wants to acquire money by that			
way 			
 Yeah 			
Look commercial purpose is okay I can understand it			
But on one side you say that women lib when we talk of women			
liberation and secondary status of women and on other side we are			
allowing them ah yes to express to expose			
 Ah yes 			
 Nai nai women is permitting them gents			
Yeah			
Even well they are taking such a poses and such photos if she			
denies it 			
How they were able to take it 			
Because if you will look at all the ac actresses 			
 uhm mainly Marathi actresses they are that Mamta Kulkarni and			
Shilpa Shirodkar 			
 Uhm 			
 Always there is a rule			
It is a shameful thing I think manhje 			
It is shameful laughs thing but it is			
Yeah			
Being men focussed by men but ladies also giving 			
pro protection by girls also that is they want so uh become			
something hero 			
And because of that they exposing even they themselves only 			
Uhm no but uh what is your experience about your uh			
village ladies and village girls specially			
Uh village girls			
Those who are taking education now a days			
No what is the problem			
Women			
Only then one uh thinking going on in the mothers of			
that girl that there are so many uh one word 			
changes no not changes and because of that my son will marry with educated			
person			
 Changes 			
Okay			
And so she will take the education			
That is not another thing because educated uh b 			
bridegroom want the educated girl because they mostly live in city			
And there is a a natural feeling in the all girls and also their			
mother and family members in their mind that there was a well			
behaved educated and there must be well man must be working in the city			
level not in the villages because there are so many problems in villages			
There are so many they send that girl in the farm 			
They don't want no ?			
Because of that each have a feeling going on that uh girls			
must be given some higher education till their marriage not for			
there one word that is wrong that is not 			
Because she must marry with doctors so they are permitting			
them to go into medical college for D H M H or B A M A only that one 			
They are not giving development to their career that is my			
point 			
No but you feel that all these new ideas and this			
modernisation in every aspect uhm manhje 			
not only considering pressure uhm because village girls			
they are more modern they are making quite modern now a days 			
 uhm 			
Not like but uh this modernisation of thinking in that context			
I am talking 			
So whether they uhm they are well acquainted with these ideas			
 because all women are like this			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 They are 			
 Uhm 			
Never never because there is a lack of one word			
 lack of rea reading there are no never they a book 			
though they are uh matriculate 			
They never read any paper any book any magazine			
Only they sometime go into the meetings that is the uh			
some uh festival 			
 Ahm they have T Vs and 			
 No uh no but I think the impact of television			
 on a village woman 			
 Television that is quite high 			
 Manhje at every evening that			
after completion of their 			
 That is not changing in the thinking ability it			
is changing in the only their uh entertainment			
 			
Yeah 			
They want entertainment			
 Haan 			
 Not actually one word 			
 They just want these movies and when the news			
will start they will just stop 			
 Will stop haan 			
They will stop the T V			
And they will go for their work in the house			
 			
Yes 			
They			
Only they will see movies and dancing programmes and			
other programmes like this some uh good family programme 			
 Programme 			
They also thinking about their			
They are inte interested only with this 			
 That is not emotional feeling that is			
emotional feeling only 			
 			
Reading habits must help because of the feeling			
isn't yes what do you think 			
 Ah haan 			
 Yes 			
Yes uh uhm that is why if anyone that			
is a 			
 Uhm 			
 			
 Uh 			
 Easily stopped na not in this			
context nobody is reading now a days 			
That is not the case with village girls or village women 			
in cities also you know I feel uh this uh problem mainly with my			
son 			
Now he is in in uh third standard 			
But uh just from seven or seven-thirty he used to sit 			
uh with the T V and used to see the programme every programme upto			
eleven pm 			
In our village also we have started uh one uh personality			
development class for some a ten year students uh in the village but			
never the students went there because he wants only T V 			
They never goes there 			
In any one word or any social or even they not in this			
for playing also 			
They are their interests are also 			
So this is a common problem			
Common problem or 			
 Manhje impact of T V in this aspect that			
is it			
Uh			
If it is a good impact then ah then we would not			
have talked like this 			
Yeah			
And there are so many English programmes and English movies			
and all these things are very nice on the T V after ten 			
But uh they never uh because they want to go			
in the farm tomorrow morning and so they were 			
 are going to sleep at eight O'clock laughter 			
After completing the Marathi and other uh that is a 			
provincial movies and all the things 			
 			
 They don't they don't go 			
 			
 Yeah 			
But nobody is well acquainted uhm with the			
 current problem of the women again this is my opinion			
because uh day by day when we look at the newspaper and when we look			
at the number of this dowry cases all these oh yes 			
burning down the girls and burnings of the women so that's			
 number is increasing on one side and on another side			
 that attraction 			
 Uhm 			
 Problem 			
 			
 Oh yes 			
 And they 			
 And here 			
Not only cities but in villages also there are every			
mother wants that she will give more and more to her daughter in			
comparison with others 			
That is their thinking and because of that they demanding that			
uh from husband that we want to one word we have to give it 			
because it is our duty 			
We have we must have satisfaction to our uh daughter we must			
satisfy our daughter 			
And daughter is also demanding there is not feeling that my			
mother is fa father is not he he's giving it is not			
enough but they are demanding 			
I am Dr B D Khane 			
I am Dr M P Patil department of History 			
How are you Patil ?			
Fine 			
What about you ?			
I am also fine 			
What about your kids ?			
They are alright 			
When did you come to the department today ?			
Uh today I came to department at eleven fifteen			
What about your refresher course you wanted to go ?			
No no 			
Do you thing that refresher course serve the right purpose 			
Yes some refresher course serve the purpose 			
But what about the most of the refresher courses ?			
Most of refresher courses are uhm not conducted on			
U G C pattern 			
Therefore the purpose which 			
Purpose is defeated			
Uhm 			
Isn't it true with also post graduation teaching ?			
Uhn ?			
Isn't it true with post graduation teaching ?			
See if some senior persons uh attended this uh 			
refresher course or gave lectures they are going to be 			
benefitted to even P G teachers			
Uhm personally I'm saying that refresher course			
 these are very frustrating 			
No no			
And then in same way the			
My experience is not that 			
I see 			
Because you know when uh I've been in Dharwad 			
 uhm there are some very good uh resource persons 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
They say like on many knotty problems like uh 			
a few words and Ashoka inscription so there are some one			
word where refresher are useful to even P G teachers 			
No even I had a very good experience at in Bombay 			
Uhm 			
But if you take into consideration the overall picture in			
India			
 Haan overall be specially in northern			
India uh th this refresher co courses are not conducted			
 very well 			
Whole purpose is defeated			
Whole they had even uh some refresher some university			
is even this uh the people would've remained absent and			
they give these certificates for example this uh Indore University			
and many others 			
It is waste of time 			
Yes the labour of time has one word money			
 Is not money 			
And the basic purpose is not served			
Yes I agree with you on that point 			
Even their teaching at post graduate level it is so			
frustrating particularly use of English medium 			
 English 			
Because generally many of the students they offer uh			
Marathi medium 			
So the point is whether we should switch over to English 			
 uhm or whether the university should uh uh incorporate			
teaching into Marathi language 			
 Uhm 			
 Uh no it would be better to teach in Marathi			
But then			
Because the majority will two words in			
ninety-nine uh people percentage they offer Marathi medium 			
Only one or two students uh if he will be outsider or			
non-Maharashtrian he only offers English			
Now what is the purpose purpose of teaching in English 			
English			
But in that case the university education will uh 			
lose its uh national uh no only Maharashtra one word 			
Marathwada Nagpur			
Yes 			
Uh offer this Marathi in which in instead of English they			
 teach in Marathi			
They have to teach in one word 			
But thereby they will lose the national character 			
How ?			
That boys from Karnataka they can't come to Maharashtra or			
the Maharashtrian can't go to			
But even in uh foreign countries uh they teach in this			
their mother tongue no 			
But the problem with India is of uh more of linguistic			
problems 			
We should have to have some common language 			
And that apart we don't have the teaching material in regional			
languages 			
Yes but that is not the problem even in Japan Russia they			
 teach in their own language 			
But Japan doesn't have the linguistic adversity as			
much as we have 			
You know we have no common language no except Hindi or this			
 E E English 			
Even this Hindi was is opposed in uh south India 			
Uh considering all this problems what I feel that we			
should have English for higher education isn't it ?			
But some nationalist leaders they oppose now this uh in			
 teaching of English 			
That is the problem with our whole education yes			
 structure 			
 Yes 			
Yes 			
We just carry on the show 			
Show yes 			
But the purpose is always defeated 			
defeated			
Uhm 			
So what else we can do ?			
Just to rise over this frustration 			
We don't have the uh satisfaction work satisfaction 			
Yes 			
But we have no other alternatives 			
I think that is case in every department of our life			
Not in the department but all over India also this problem			
all we are facing 			
The question of the work culture is never promisive 			
Yes yes 			
But it is good thing that uh we have some modern			
transit here laughter uhm			
Study the art he scored more and this one word 			
and intellectual 			
Now he's uh uh facing his first uh examination coming			
November 			
Yeah but you also must have helped him as a parent 			
Yeah that support we give I brought books uh then			
tuitions and all other things 			
But the hard work is also credit goes to my student only 			
because he studied hard 			
But beside the financial support one needs the moral support			
too that you must have done			
We extended it 			
We both parents my wife and I 			
Then we create this uh convinient uh atmosphere at home also			
Not disturbing him in on any issue 			
Right from the beginning he was punctual in his study 			
He got up early in the morning at five O'clock then he			
 one word in throughout the year 			
What was that 			
Total two words 			
Uhm he scored sir ninety-seven marks for two			
words into now he is in Miraj in government medical college			
Miraj 			
Because again there is this preference for uh			
 one word 			
Out of hundred uh seats uh only twenty-four seats are			
open 			
Remaining seventy-six they are alloted to this category			
or other category 			
Only twenty-four seats are open to these students 			
And his uh number was ninety 			
And how is your daughter ?			
Daughter is fine 			
Uhm			
I have not considered her anything to do if she likes			
Arts she can go in for Arts if she is interested in medicine she			
will go in for medicine 			
But actually what I'm telling her that you just go on			
working hard don't think of uh reservation or that sort of thing 			
My second son is also clever 			
He stood in uh in the first two words 			
He is studying in tenth standard 			
He is included in scholar batch 			
In scholar batch also he topped first uh in this uh first			
test semester 			
That is also true of her she stood first in her school			
But at the same time she did not only study but also			
participate in other curricular activity curricular activity in			
sports 			
She is active one word 			
She is more active 			
Expected in one word 			
Yes so I always tell her that percentage is not that			
important but the knowledge is very important			
My younger son is also allround allrounder			
 			
He took part in the sports games 			
He is good uh swimmer he is good runner he is playing			
cricket football 			
 In On teachers day he become a various			
teacher 			
I think only that much we can do for our students 			
Yes 			
Because reservation or no reservation is not in our hand			
So only we can give some kind of confidence in them and			
provide this sort of uh guidence to them if you work hard 			
some day you will are bound to be rewarded 			
And reward come in their own way 			
Not necessarily that everything they should			
Hard work is essential 			
Hard work is 			
To get any success 			
And positive attitude is also very important 			
One shouldn't get frustrated or disgusted because of this			
reservation policy 			
Yeah 			
They always say that there is always a room on the top 			
place on the top 			
Because now a days there is a lot of competition in every			
field 			
Competition is there but this competition is not healthy 			
often it is manipulated competition 			
 Sir sir one word this uh 			
reserved candidate uh of fifty-five percent of student he get uh			
this seat to M B B S 			
But open candidate who who secured more than			
ninety-one			
 Competition is 			
 One word 			
Correct 			
Private college			
Uhm 			
Private colleges 			
No no in the government college this reservation due to			
reservation uhm 			
But open candidate even ninety-nine three he will not get 			
 Uhm 			
Now as we say that the purpose of refresher course is			
defeated the same the purpose of reservation 			
 This is also defeated 			
They go to Delhi 			
 It's a one word college not a one			
word 			
And it is aimed at electoral benefit 			
All our education policies should be over hauled 			
Yes 			
Now a days 			
This is in our country this is because the government			
take the popular decision			
Yes 			
Government doesn't stick to some basic level of standard			
or basic criterias 			
There is so much uh corruption in education too 			
Yes there actually that in a every uh 			
So we study only for the sake of examination 			
examination not for the knowledge 			
 Examination 			
Knowledge 			
And the examinations are			
Because the students study only this uh superguide 			
They don't attend lecture 			
They were not uh punctual in their attendence in the class 			
They don't read any English book 			
They don't take notes in the class 			
They only depend on this uh uh super guides or the			
shortcomings 			
These are the bitter truths of a democracy			
Yes 			
Since all the elements of uh democracy are manifested in			
Indian experience			
Yes 			
But even though the uh all these are two things India			
is a great democracy you see in the world 			
That is it has played ourselves but in reality the			
experience is totally different 			
Uhn that is 			
In every country this problem of this uh corruption 			
is going on 			
In every country particularly in Russia 			
Now other day I			
The political and other economic condition is worse than			
India in Russia 			
No corruption is uh everywhere			
Corruption one word 			
But the degree degree varies			
In Western Asia the religion uh West Asia religion is			
very important for them 			
The Islamic pe people they don't want any change 			
Islamic nations they are static they don't want any change			
 any progressive progress 			
In comparison between Muslim country India is better 			
other day I happen to see the list of uh ten countries in the world 			
where there is least corruption 			
The list is published in Times of India 			
And what is the number of uh our 			
There is not a single city from India 			
I think only one Asia I think Japan yeah and			
Singapore feature in that			
 Yeah 			
No corruption there 			
Corrupt it is easy to do themselves uhm in			
those cities 			
There may be corruption but it is not that uh problematic			
So the businessman they all of prefer that city			
 Uhm 			
What is uh solution for to overcome this corruption ?			
In our case the democracy has attempted to the problems of			
corruption for example our problem in educational field 			
mostly they come from the one word uh elections for the			
academic positions whereas in America there are no elections for			
academic position			
Academic position 			
 Two words the criteria in college uh 			
teachers are bound to be elected 			
 Laughs 			
Both of you how do you find this your course ?			
Well clears her throat it's quite			
interesting I mean uh like uh when it really comes to 			
practical point of view it's quite interesting 			
Now at the moment we are just uh blindly studying regarding all			
the uh how the uhm dental materials used and how are the 			
things that are mixed together 			
And like what are the materials that are used for dentures and			
what are the materials that are used for fillings and everything 			
mixing dying and then setting them everything we are dealing in 			
dental material 			
Whereas this is a such a bore 			
 I'm in final year but like they have started from			
first year itself 			
So that we get a whole round uh must have point point			
of view regarding the subject 			
Then uhm then regarding anatomy and then physiology and all			
that we come to know whether uh structures that are present			
anatomically and then physiology means like whether the system are			
 working and how how does it 			
Suppose for example in digestive system like how does it get			
disturbed or how does the liver works and all those things we			
study in physiology 			
And then though they are like we find it quite dry at			
the moment but when it comes to the clinical when we see the			
patients and when we deal with the patients then it's quite			
interesting I mean 			
So you have started dealing with your patients and all ?			
No no we are uh just starting to face like			
We are in first year 			
So clinicals we start from third year onwards 			
So we are looking forward for training 			
So like your practical is still with like how is your 			
what is the process of your practicals ?			
I mean uh in third year or you mean in 			
every year every year we have got different practicals 			
 No right now so far 			
Suppose for physiology also we have uh two practicals like 			
amphibian and human physiology 			
In human physiology we take the samples of the blood and then we			
test the blood and then we count R B C count then W B C count then			
 like uhm after that we see the hemoglobin one word			
 and then differential count in W B C 			
All these things we count 			
That is to we take on the coughs our human blood			
itself 			
Then in amphibian practical we dissect the frog 			
Then we try to see the models which then the oscillation			
and then one word of uh nerves and everything 			
So that comes under physiology			
And bio-chem we have separately done like how are this uh			
 proteins and nutrition differential bet between the unknown			
solutions 			
They will give us some unknown solutions and we have to do the 			
experiments until we found out whether it's protein or whether			
it is carbohydrates or sometimes urea uh uric acid all those things			
 It's uh chemistry lab ?			
Yeah it's done in separately in chemistry			
lab 			
So how many practicals you have ?			
How many practicals uh like for physiology we have 			
two practicals and bio-chem we have one practical and we have			
dissection in anatomy that's also a practical like 			
And then uh we have for physics practicals where we			
 like finding the cast and out of cast we have to form uh make			
display and although the display we equip with uh wax ring 			
 like			
So those are some models like we have to know from now onwards			
So that is in practical practically in uhm for			
physics 			
So you are in second year now ?			
You are in second year ?			
Yeah 			
Then like uh after your after you finish your			
degree what is your further plans ?			
Well if I get through perfectly you know I mean good			
colours then I would like to go for my P G and that's post			
graduation in we have got seven different uh like uh departments			
So in each department we can chose whichever you want to do			
Specialise 			
Yeah that's specialise 			
So I want to do in ortho 			
What is Ortho ?			
Ortho orthodentia that is uh they put braces and all			
those things 			
And what about Chandini ?			
So far how is your ragging ? laughter 			
Ragging laughs fine			
 Cough 			
No you just tell like how your seniors used to rag you your			
classmates and 			
No they used to ask us about our biodata no ?			
And they uh make us sing and then dance 			
They are also enjoying uh we are also enjoying 			
So you also you enjoyed ragging			
 Ah ha 			
 What so what sort of ragging they			
used to ?			
Mentally not physically and not physically 			
recording broken or a long pause 			
So uh what I mean what do you think about the people			
in India ?			
I mean here in Hyderabad the people are it's 			
okay they are nice 			
I mean uh my friends they are friendly and uh used to			
help me a lot in my work 			
And this just a one uh one month back time I am here in			
Hyderabad 			
So I have made friends with uh some of my classmates 			
And uh so so to say friendly and laughs 			
Helpful yeah			
Yeah helpful 			
Usually the people here in I mean down in south they			
are very helpful			
Yeah south			
But what I find the difference in 			
According to any			
I mean only in south eastern they are like in Bangalore			
where the people are quite different like they are helpful as well as			
they are quite broadminded and they are quite friendly with the people			
and I mean I mean the environment is so different from			
Hyderabad			
Yeah			
Whereas Hyderabad the people are more conservative and			
like they don't like to go out even or at the first move they			
don't like to talk with people also 			
But whereas when they really come to know the people they like to			
help the people 			
Then uh for example like whereas in Bangalore you go out in			
shorts or even the females go out in shorts or anything like that			
they don't mind 			
I mean they are more advanced in all those things and then			
 whereas in Hyderabad if you even wear a skirt even like then			
they give a good I mean back stare at you and you feel out of place			
like when you wear all those stuff 			
Then you feel that okay somebody is observing me so much and			
you feel uncomfortable in all those things 			
Whereas in Bangalore you are free like 			
I don't think people will be least bothered like even if you go			
 almost like a naked female and laughs 			
So those are the difference according to the places also			
And whereas in Madras when you can see the people are I			
mean what to say uh they are still yet to build up in all			
those things 			
Atleast in Hyderabad it's I mean they have become more			
modernised like in comparatively in twin cities like in			
Secunderabad also the people are quite different and the girls and			
the boys all they are more modernised than in Hyderabad			
Whereas in Hyderabad they still have the old cultures and so			
many things that even the parents they don't even let the girls talk			
with the guys 			
It is hidden talking like they get a good punch at home or			
something like that laughs 			
But whereas in Secunderabad they are so fast they even go for 			
pubs and discos and here and there clubs and then so many other I			
mean extra curricular activities are going on 			
But whereas in Hyderabad they are only stuck with their books			
and home and work that's all like 			
There is a lot of different difference 			
between these two twin cities itself 			
So then comparitively to north south is quite to see			
in study point of view south is quite good 			
Whereas in north there is lot of activities may be it's			
 due to the influence of the tourist people from different countries and			
 all those things 			
So in north I should say they are more advanced than in			
study point of view they are not that uh good as good as in south			
So I mean that is the difference I find between this uh			
north and south 			
And what about ragging difference between north and south ?			
Well the ragging in south is quite I mean quite			
cool I should say because you don't have any physical torturement or			
anything like that 			
They just ask some simple questions regarding your biodata			
 then your hobbies then they may ask you to sing a song or			
dance or ask for a treat 			
 That's the maximum they do here 			
But whereas in north they literally kill the person like			
You know most of the people who who go to north for			
medical studies they are really scared 			
I don't want to go there because they are physically tortured			
like uh sometimes they even ask them to go the morgery and at			
midnight twelve O'clock whereas everyone is so scared like 			
laughs 			
Yeah			
And thinking about dissection hall itself they really			
get scared and that also in the midnight uh 			
 Haan 			
So they asked them to go to the morgery whereas 			
in the morgery even the fresh bodies are I mean kept 			
So sometimes they I mean they ask the students to go to			
the dissection hall and identify so many things 			
At the same time some of their same collegues they			
must be hiding I mean lying down in the stretcher and they just wake up			
suddenly so 			
There was were two cases in			
north that two persons had died because of this type of ragging			
Yeah yeah 			
And then			
It has been			
So far yeah 			
So far what I have heard is that in north they have asked uh			
 a guy they gave him uh a huge I mean piece of uh			
soap and they asked him to they gave him some specific time and			
asked him to take bath and finish that soap 			
Well that guy he was finding very difficult to do that			
and he tried his best to finish that soap 			
So by the time he finished the soap he was admitted in the			
hospital 			
 Accha 			
That that serious he became 			
Then uh there are so many serious ragging done by the			
seniors in north 			
But whereas in south like I feel the lecturers and the professors			
 whoever in-charge then the principal they are controlling the			
students in that point of view 			
But in north they are not bothered like they			
just leave upto the students 			
So the seniors really torture the juniors and			
 I mean they find it difficult to stay there			
So many students have left their course just because of			
ragging 			
 So 			
 And so far like what I have heard about uh			
 one college is that one guy was asked to go to the ladies hostel 			
 Haan 			
Uhn the warden was a spinster so like 			
he has asked the guy to I mean the senior has asked the guy to go it			
is panties along alone like to go early in the morning and ask			
her what did she do with her husband the previous night 			
So at the same time like he refused to do 			
So they asked him to stand at the college gate with			
the panties alone			
Uhn 			
So that that was when he became mad 			
And he is really a mental off the person now at the moment			
So those are the differnces you can find like how badly			
they are ragging in north and south 			
South how lenient they are 			
So what you like ?			
Do you think that there should be ragging or not ?			
Well in my point of view okay ragging means what they are			
doing in the south I really appreciate 			
Unless you rag your junior by asking so many I mean			
whatever you want to ask that junior never bothers to say hi			
 even like in their later life like when the college			
goes on smoothly like 			
So in that point of view ragging is good 			
What I feel is so that you get to know the junior and the			
junior comes to know who you are and what a person you are 			
Then you can have a healthy friendship I should say like 			
I mean the ragging should be quite healthy not I			
mean not unhealthy one 			
So Champani you are new to this place ?			
 			
Yeah 			
How do you find the college and the ragging towards you ?			
 			
The college is uh it's nice uh but living			
in so far is not so one word no ?			
Yeah 			
 			
The place is it's quite nice 			
So first day of your dissection when you saw the dead bodies			
how did you feel and when they showed you the I guess they must have			
have shown you the morgery where they have preserved the dead bodies 			
How they are preserved ?			
 			
Yeah 			
So how did you find all those things ?			
 			
On the first day I was very scared even to touch the body			
 na 			
So how do you feel now ?			
 			
Ah I don't feel anything now 			
I am sure you must have uh washed your hands at least			
 ten times before eating after touching the bodies 			
laughs 			
 			
 Yeah 			
 			
Yeah it's so smelly no 			
Ah then how about now you wash atleast once ? 			
laughs 			
Because now we have one word 			
 You don't wash you don't wash now 			
Yeah there are students who doesn't wash at all and eat food			
because they are so used to it 			
Ah ha			
I mean just an ordinary wash okay you rinse your hand in			
the water end up but you know it become so casual like			
Yeah 			
But the first day when you go for a dissection or when			
you just touch the dead bodies you feel something and then when you			
go back home you specially wash your hands in the dettol atleast for			
ten times and you just keep on rubbing your nails and clean everything			
and you know that's how it happens but slowly you			
became like used to all those things 			
Hello 			
Hello Shastri here one minute hello			
Uh you are speaking one word 			
I just I arrived at uh twelve O'clock

By the time I came here it was almost two

 Laughs 			
As there was a lot of confusion about the name of the medicine you			
wanted or something 			
So anyway			
No no see here I didn't expect her to 			
come back and deliver it I thought she would give you a prescription and you			
would buy it			
 Any

prescription thing it seems			
She sent it to me by post 			
Oh your medicine ?			
No mine also ahn and some capsules for your			
mother			
 Ahn 			
Same pack uh she has given you			
I see and			
 That's for the arthritis 			
Uh I see and some uh this benedol

So she gave me four packets			
Ahn 			
And she said uh I may use one			
Uh 			
And give you the remaining three			
No if you want you can two more 			
Ah no no actually I you see uh towards the end of my			
trip			
 Haan 			
In Germany			
 Haan 			
I started having trouble with my knee			
Oh			
May be because of carrying a lot of luggage all round			
Oh yes yes			
But otherwise I was okay in Lancaster			
 Haan 			
And also in London 			
 Haan 			
And things went off all right			
But the medicine help to relieve some pain 			
 Yeah yes it does help to relieve the pain			
I I didn't try that capsule			
 Haan 			
 Haan 			
Because I I said anyway I had one or two left over			
some what you had given me 			
 Haan accha 			
And she also gave me some cremes you know			
Oh			
To apply externally 			
 I see ahn			
And some how now now that I am back laughs 			
Ah that is one word with you			
In one piece yes laughs 			
Main problem is food you know that			
Food yeah 			
She was telling me I felt very bad I will carry 			
something for him			
 Yeah 			
Yeah she did bring something 			
Ahn			
I mean ac actually you know luckily the Lancaster			
people made arrangement for me			
 Haan 			
In a uh see flat			
 Haan 			
With some three or four different rooms and one kitchen and			
hall one word and all that			
I see			
So immedietly after two days I was made comfortable			
 for my 			
 So you got to cook your own			
Yeah I could cook my own food actually even the			
kitchenware and everything was there			
Very good 			
So I didn't have any problem in Lancaster			
 Haan 			
So the whole of uh May went off well 			
Very good			
But the moment I went to Holland for a day and went 			
return to London			
Oh 			
In London you know they put me up in a uh international			
hall			
 Haan 			
And there they were uh serving breakfast and even the			
 dinner			
 Haan 			
And was all included in the payment			
 Accha 			
So if I didn't eat at night and went out outside and			
some how but in anycase I couldn't eat much			
 Oh you should one word and one word 			
 			
 Haan 			
But some how it was all over			
 Haan haan 			
So then uh 			
So how are you ?			
What what how are things one word 			
Well going on and so you your trip			
was very good it seems			
Yes I think 			
 And did Leech remember me very 			
 Oh he did yeah he did actually			
many other people remembered your presence there			
 Yeah 			
Who else did you meet ?			
Ah there was Dick Alright I don't know what two words			
Yeah yeah Dick Alright was 			
Around			
Here in Bombay haan 			
No			
Does he remember me ?			
No I don't know 			
May be and then you know I contacted uh Tomkin 			
Ah Allan 			
 Allan Allan Tomkin I telephoned ah			
 and I even he even wrote to me			
 Ah 			
 Haan 			
Because I I was to get some books for the Maharashtra			
Board			
 Haan 			
S S C Board			
 Haan 			
Actually I have ordered books 			
 Haan 			
At the last moment haan I			
thought you know actually it was difficult to get all the books in			
one place			
 Haan 			
Right 			
And so there there is a special E L T shop 			
 haan called Kelse 			
 Haan 			
Yes Kelse is very one word 			
catalogue yes yes			
 In London 			
Oh then actually you know that is the place from where you			
can even directly order things			
 Haan 			
He told me			
Yeah yeah 			
Ah even if you ask for a direct mail order uhm			
 we will supply			
 Uhm 			
 Accha 			
Anyway I have paid and ordered books for S S C Board			
 Haan 			
And he promised to send it at a cost of very marginal charge			
I see			
Yeah 			
So many jobs many assignment laughs 			
Oh I know 			
How was the S S C Board meeting ?			
Did you go to this uh meeting on fifteen 			
 Fifteen yes ahn ah Kadepurkar			
 see we were we carried work home and this glossary and all that			
 Ahn 			
Uhm 			
Finally there were other changes some rejection			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh unfortunately there was no electricity nothing you			
know uhm 			
There was a total breakdown			
 Uhm 			
Oh I see			
We were to continue the next day			
 Haan haan 			
But then there was this holiday and one word strike			
Really			
So even the S S C Board people were going to be			
away			
 Uh 			
Oh I see			
So it was the meeting went on upto five O'clock in			
that sultry heat 			
And then we I returned home means in the evening 			
 Haan haan 			
Was there any any decision about another meeting uh ?			
Yes eighteenth July is the what you call the first			
language			
 Haan 			
Then third or fourth July the third language			
Third language and uhm this did that uh Apte lady			
come 			
Yes she came			
 Haan haan how how did			
She of course she was very quiet probably she was			
just getting to know things			
Yeah haan 			
And uh she didn't look that one word type 			
 yes that uh 			
 Yes 			
Yeah yeah 			
I was made to believe she would be 			
 Worry oh or worried okay			
Uhn well uh everything was fine 			
 I think I think she is not bad 			
No anyway I don't have to work with her			
I know			
I will be in other group			
I know			
But even then she didn't seem to be one of those one			
word though she has lot of weight to throw around 			
No doubt no doubt I mean may be she has			
 She is 			
She is physically very fat 			
 Laughs 			
I see is it			
No you haven't seen her 			
I have seen her but I've normally may have			
 may have put on some more weight in the meanwhile			
 Oh she is quiet bulky yeah 			
No no no 			
Because it is almost two years since I saw her three			
 or two or three years			
 Three 			
Ahn 			
Because I I am one of those unfortunate people 			
 haan who have been responsible for uh awarding Ph D			
to laughs so many 			
 Haan 			
 Ahn I see			
Actually I looked into her thesis also			
Oh I see			
And that must have been three years ago			
 Haan because I see 			
 And I had gone			
I felt a lot of consolation looking at her size			
 laughs 			
Come on			
And so she has a lot of weight to throw around and she did			
 laughter 			
She was good ah and then uh I see some			
passages were rejected			
 Ah 			
Ahn 			
And then 			
 From the ones which we had already taken			
Yes yes and then some in some cases 			
Kadepurkar you know see another thing is he is conducting the whole procedure			
in Marathi 			
 Oh how unfortunate 			
Oh God 			
Not being audible to half the audience oh it			
was not it was a messy affair			
 Oh 			
Oh I see			
So I was telling			
And wasn't Gokhale there 			
Oh he was there			
Ah ha			
But he did a good job whatever you had assigned			
to him 			
 I think yeah I think he is			
We had a session of passages and he had look through			
Ah ha			
And uh 			
 Wa wa was was there more material forthcoming 			
I'm I'm just e e e 			
Ahn yes yes of course material did come 			
 Haan haan 			
So we have made a fresh selection in the meantime Michael			
West dictionary has come			
Very good very good			
We all got a copy			
Oh I am glad 			
Yeah 			
Ah			
So the now we are meeting on the evening itself 			
 haan with some more material			
 Haan 			
Alright			
And then I told Kadepurkar look 			
 Haan 			
We are not going to look at the material one word 			
endlessly			
 Haan 			
Now you make a final selection and we will start working			
No no I think that snag is somewhat there			
 Haan 			
That you know I have I have diagnosed the case but I have got			
to haan do that unfortunately no 			
 job of coordinating in the sense that people pulling in			
different direction 			
 Haan 			
 Haan haan 			
It looks like one word 			
Like you know the Board people ahn want to			
assert their whatever you know			
 Ahn 			
It looked like it and they are not able to			
select			
 Yeah 			
No no they want to assert there right alright but then uh			
 I mean I not all not many of them were really academically uh			
capable of you know isn't it ?			
Yeah			
I don't know really			
Yeah it's all the you see uh uh what you call			
 one word was not very wrong			
Yeah 			
But the way she went about was wrong 			
 That's right			
Anyway yeah the point yes uh 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
But then we have to somehow manage the show 			
Exactly			
So I I maybe you know atleast in my presence 			
they somehow seem to agree to many of the things that I 			
You know one word it looks like that 			
This time people were opposing 			
I know 			
And uh my group is not so bad			
Yeah 			
Except that Lalita Ghatge everytime she brought a piece 			
 uhn it was one word down to L three 			
 Uhn 			
Oh really			
But she said why don't you all one word include me			
in L three istead of doing this 			
 Haan 			
I am doing other peoples work ahn she was			
annoyed			
 Ahn 			
Actually that may be a good really because the small			
 one word you know ahn and if she can really be			
of use to L three 			
 Ahn 			
But it doesn't two words material production I don't			
know 			
Yeah what she is capable of			
Ah yes but you know the whole problem is except			
Wakankar in that group uhm nobody else really knows the job			
 Uhm 			
I know I know 			
Wakankar has been a school teacher			
Yeah yeah			
He has uh actually been in the field			
 Ahn 			
Uh in our case uhm we have something			
called common sense			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
In our group			
Oh oh then			
 A few words yeah we may not have the			
experience uhn but we have common sense			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Uhn 			
Uhn 			
Now your uh gentleman Kulkarni didn't turn up 			
Oh I see 			
Yes he didn't turn 			
 He must have had some problem yeah			
 yes I think somebody was ill			
 One word 			
 Haan 			
He wrote to me in London			
 Two words he I think his one word			
 			
 He had gone to Bombay yeah somebody was			
ill and unfortunately she died also actually a relative of his			
 Oh I see 			
I see			
And there you know a relative was in London and I was to			
go and see them 			
I see 			
May be anyway yeah 			
 That may the reason			
I mean in any case I I mean last meting atleast I			
thought he had got some material and they were accepted			
 Haan 			
Ultimately you know somebody has to do the job anyway			
 let's see			
Right			
Uh what else how are you ?			
Oh otherwise theek hai then uh uhm you			
know two words 			
How is that you take the whole thing 			
 And she asked me no no she is waiting			
for a letter from the Board 			
I I			
She asked me did I read letter and uh because 			
one word he came on the fourteenth no next day			
 Yeah 			
Right			
On thirteenth			
Right 			
So Raj Rajni's brother nothing was right			
Ahn I know 			
So I said probably it was read at the Board level			
Yeah			
So I said anyway I'll find out			
I asked to Pradhan			
Uhm 			
So that he watch over there that letter was really 			
presented			
Uhm			
So he said whatever we want to tell her we will write over			
there atleast she must have received but she hasn't received anything from			
them			
Oh 			
Was the letter read ?			
Yeah letter was read and actually discussed every point was			
 uh actually mm sort of taken haan 			
and ultimately this uh see people felt that there is no point in uh 			
uh you know discussing everything			
 Haan 			
 Haan 			
We just stick to the old decision that she drops out			
and there is an end of it 			
Yeah 			
So you know			
 Haan 			
See now Verona			
Ah Nalini			
Actually I'm Nalini 			
 Accha 			
After a long time you phone na 			
Yeah 			
For a very long time we have not met

So I have decided 			
What happened ?			
Uh about what ?			
No why you didn't ring up for a long time ?			
Uh yeah uh I was not well for some time			
 Accha accha 			
So I couldn't ring you			
I see

telephone			
Why you are not going to work also ?			
I wasn't going for sometime			
Now I've started			
 Accha accha 			
How you are keeping now ?			
Now I'm very much better

And he has described all about that			
 Accha accha 			
So very beautifully he says uhm uhm and he has			
not seen like that in India

Ah ha 			
She in fact I'd invited her to see Kolhapur 			
I see			
As she has never come this side			
Ah 			
But this season of monsoon I thought maybe she will they will			
not enjoy it much			
Ah ha			
So any way let me see I might receive her call one of			
these days			
Ah ha			
 She's going to stay longer she might come down			
I see			
Then maybe I'll have to plan to take her to			
Panhala or some other places Bijapur or something nice places

And are you going to Bombay to visit her ?			
Uh yeah most probably I will be visiting her in this

Uh yeah not bad idea			
Yeah 			
Do you have holi holidays I mean you got			
leave enough no			
Yeah I got leave enough so I can apply for that and we			
can go together			
Ah that's not a bad idea 			
 So then we can 			
That will be pleasant travel I suppose			
 Laughter Yeah yeah good company			
So very long time we have not travelled together			
You know it's boring also 			
 I think it was uh about four or five years

So all of them always watch			
Uhm uhm			
But I'm not so interested in all these things			
Why ?			
 It's quite nice 			
Ah maybe but I like to go around in the evening after			
working whole day			
Yeah			
I don't like to sit at home			
I know			
So I feel like going out and having some fresh air 			
Ah that's true			
And if I do some 			
And walking is also good for health 			
 walking yeah good exercise after			
sitting whole day in the branch so better to walk around 			
 That's true I've also			
grown some backpain these days			
Ah ha 			
Taking some tablets also 			
Are you taking any exercises for that			
Yes so sometimes when it is very bad I go for it 			
Ah ha 			
At times you feel very lazy no ?			
Yeah 			
When it comes to too much then only we try to do			
something			
Ah ha 			
Otherwise careless 			
Well you should uh be very punctual about all these			
things			
Right right it's true man 			
 Laughter 			
What of other things what how is your aunty ?

Uh she should take leave because she has got enough leave			
Ah 			
Three months or something 			
Ah ha 			
She might take these just after February

Then she will rest later on			
Ah ha 			
She is happy that she is retiring she is very tired now			
Yeah always this how long she was working ?			
Uh she is working mean quite many years some 			
before working here in the bank she had work was working some where private			
Ah ha 			
Now she is completing sixty 			
So			
She has joined before nineteen sixty-eight			
 At least 			
More than thirty years she must one word			
 Service 			
Yes yes			
Yeah 			
So naturally she must be tired of all these 			
 I know 			
We are feeling tired now itself			
Yeah laughter 			
I am waiting for that 			
To get retire			
Yeah 			
Anyway you can you can hope for it because your son			
is grown up after two years he will go start working 			
 Yeah 			
Oh yeah			
So you have it stand a chance isn't it ?			
Yea it's so nice laughs 			
And I heard fr from my brother recently

His son is uh now they are getting some proposals for			
him			
Oh			
So they are thinking of getting him married 			
Isn't he he is very young isn't it ?			
Yeah he is quite young but now-a-day think he is 			
marriageable age laughter 			
So			
So now they are a ac actually his mother is			
very impatient 			
I see			
For him to get married that's why they are			
trying now 			
 Accha 			
So I think most probably they will fix it in Decemeber			
I see 			
So I'm I'm thinking of telling my son to			
come down during that time so that he can attend the marriage 			
 accha and have fun at least			
 Accha 			
Yeah you're correct 			
Ah because he will be coming on 			
 He will be coming after six years 			
Yeah and after six years will be coming 			
Uhm			
So if once after one and half years he comes and			
visit that will be nice 			
I see			
 That's what I feel			
Yeah yeah it will be nice 			
Don't forget to call me when he comes to India 			
 Yeah of course sure yeah laughs 			
So for quite sometime we have not seen each other

So for six months she will be away from the house			
Uhn ha uhn ha			
Then she has written she like gynaecology very much 			
I see			
So she got lot of interest in that subject and is			
thinking of doing her M D in that subject			
Very nice 			
And she got a chance of operating also during her			
internship itself nice laughs and because that Cama			
hospital is uh for ladies only so she has lot of			
experience			
 Nice 			
 Yeah 			
 It's so fast no this children are grown 			
 growing up 			
Yeah I know laughs 			
And just 			
 Just thinking we had seen them			
Two three years back we were thinking they're kid			
 laughs 			
Oh but that 			
And now now they are all graduated			
That means we too have grown older now

Because once I come home feel tired			
Yeah I know			
Then I start with my cooking

 Yeah 			
Ah ha			
So I feel I must do on my own that only we've to			
keeps me occupy in the till the evening say eight nine O'clock 			
Ah ha 			
Once I've my dinner then I feel very tired and			
sleepy			
Yeah laughs 			
And you have to go to your branch very early I suppose			
 Very early yeah eight thirty quarter to nine			
Ah 			
Busy till four thirty			
Ah 			
Not much work these days because first week and last week			
only we've quiet good business 			
I see 			
It is not worry much 			
Ah 			
 It's a nice place			
Maybe because of the rainy season 			
Yeah likes to but still anyway the place is			
nice the branch is very good			
 Likes to 			
I see			
Customers are quite interesting different type of characters			
have been there			
I see 			
So it's a nice experience uh			
Ah ha and you must 			
 I like that 			
You must be having all those students also			
Yeah quiet a number			
Ah 			
And they come from different parts of India no			
Ah 			
So different languages			
Ah 			
Different people 			
Yeah			
 It's nice to meet people from from different parts			
Yeah I know 			
They come with their problems and all that we feel really			
sorry for them yeah leaving their family memebers and coming			
down and staying here			
 Yeah 			
Ah laughs 			
We feel sorry for them at times 			
Yeah			
Sometimes when they specially have no funds at all no 			
Ah 			
Means some balance in the account 			
 Haan haan 			
Recommend them beg of me madam just allow me to			
withdraw don't allow us to keep means 			
Normally I feel sorry for them			
Yeah yeah			
 They've nobody here no			
Ah 			
Whom will they go ?			
Sometimes we realise suppose we goes go 			
 to their place and what will happen to us ?			
Yeah 			
Somebody should help us no 			
Yeah 			
So what you do then ?			
Normaly no we don't overdrawn on account but 			
 haan haan whatever is balance you know 			
 yeah help them give them ha ha suppose cheque			
books and all we are supposed to keep them yeah two fifty			
balance			
 Haan haan 			
 Yeah 			
 Ha ha 			
 Yeah 			
Ah 			
At times we curtail that			
Ah ha			
And help them 			
Yeah			
What else to do			
Yes 			
That is a good idea 			
I know			
And uh what about closing uh what			
Ah closing work almost completed no 			
Ah ha 			
Now next month only no			
Yeah			
The two words deposit and other things			
So but uh they this month you you have to apply			
interest also for			
No that is all finish by			
I see			
 I'm I have already			
finished and finished jotting and balancing the books and all			
Ah ha ha 			
Whatever may it goes I think people have to accept it			
Uhm 			
Incidently haan ho 			
how is the disturbance in your part about Dandia 			
 Haan 			
No there are no such celebrations here			
Yours is the perfectly peaceful residential area			
It appears because 			
Ah 			
Uh are there any in Rajarampuri ?			
The they are there are in Rajarampuri			
 Accha so everything is really			
No no not in the area where I am staying			
Ah 			
So 			
I think Sykes Extension there is a photograph in 			
today's Sakal 			
 Accha 			
Uh I think there are many enthusiasts there 			
Ah but they didn't have the uh requirement of getting up			
early next mo morning and going for work			
 Same thing 			
Ah 			
So they can relax 			
Today is a holiday 			
Ah 			
But I think this has been going on for the past few			
days 			
That that is for all 			
 It'll continue I think till the uh			
end of the festival			
Yes from first that is the from pratipada			
 to navmi 			
 Haan 			
And Dasara is the tenth			
day			
Right right 			
So			
So does it go on for all the ten days ?			
Yes 			
Ahm			
Uhm it start from Navratra first day			
Ahm 			
Then you go on upto tenth Dasara 			
is tenth 			
 Even if the 			
I think in yesterdays or day before uhm there was			
an article in the Times 			
 Uhm 			
Yes yes yes yes 			
 What's in it 			
How I mean noisy and uh the spirit behind it has been lost			
Completly			
And it has now become you see more or less uh a			
commercialized uh laughter all sorts of things can take place			
Ahn and you know it's an excellant opportunity to			
see girls			
Right right			
Mix with girls you're right and girls			
 I mean from the families where you would probably not be able to pick			
your say nose also			
 You're right 			
Right right			
So that is and unfortunate part of it is the community			
which you supposed to have this kind of skill ahn is			
 not uh aware of the risk that it involves right 			
in exposing the members of the senior members of this family			
 Ahn 			
 Right 			
 Perhaps you see 			
We have been pushed into the background ahn			
 others have taken over it 			
 Ahn 			
Ahn that's what it seems now 			
 It it appears 			
And nahi also it got mixed up			
with you see western thought laughter culture kinds of			
you see entertainment			
 Nahi 			
With their tiparies in their hand they have			
all those western dances 			
 Uhn 			
But you accepted			
Uhn 			
That indeed there is no longer you see either religious or			
devotional like it seems to have lost its meaning altogether			
That is that is but then the I don't mind if it has			
lost meaning to those people themselves			
Ahn 			
You know it's certainly disturbing to the others			
Right right 			
It goes on till three two or three in the morning 			
 And 			
And the the Times Of India report says			
that the decibels are hundred haan which is 			
which is very high pitch 			
 Haan 			
Right 			
A nine tunnel truck laughter you see as we see it			
on our Highway in front of our college ahn everyday when			
we engage the classes 			
 Ahn 			
 Yes yes 			
Hardly anything can be heard you see whenever uh if the			
vehicles pass uhm through at the same time 			
 Uhm 			
That is true			
You know we can't help it 			
But fortunately in Nagala Park there is no such disturbance			
And you should be really pleased with it			
Correct 			
How is Akshay ?			
Nice he is			
Ahn			
 It's a holiday for him today 			
Ah ha			
So he's at home 			
 Accha 			
He was not well for quite sometime			
Really ?			
Yes 			
What was it ?			
I don't know I see he hasn't got an appetite that is			
 that seems to be his main trouble			
I see 			
Uh either he has no appetite haan			
 or has I mean becomes so I mean angry at times 			
 Haan 			
Ah ha 			
Over himself 			
I think he must be very playful that is one of the reason			
 He's of course playful			
Ah if he is playful you know they just forget			
Right 			
Ah very often that they have to eat and suddenly when 			
they feel very uncomfortable they start crying			
And we were all you see 			
 And don't realize 			
For a fortnight			
Uhm 			
Uh on a tour for South India			
Oh I see ah ha			
Perhaps that too is a strain you see			
Uhm correct 			
So after his return uh he wasn't well for a day or			
two			
I see 			
But now he seems fine 			
 Fine accha uhn 			
Incidently I hope you know 			
Uhn 			
I lost my dog 			
 Achha yeah sorry 			
 Yeah 			
Uh I mean what brought about the the end ?			
Nothing it was just a natural death 			
out of old age 			
 Maybe I think 			
 Old age 			
You see 			
Yes 			
Ah 			
See after a particular stage ah as it happens			
in case of uh man			
 Ah 			
Yes yes of course any living thing you see 			
Ah any living thing			
There are there're 			
The process of degeneration start 			
Yes everything has yes come to an end			
 Yes 			
Yes 			
Then how did you I mean dispose it off 			
Uh we buried him in our uh compound 			
 Ah ha 			
 That's what I too thought 			
Yes 			
I had I had I I had invited a pe vet 			
ah about a month back			
 Ah 			
Right 			
And then I just sought his advice because you know I had			
earlier gone to Dagade 			
Ah 			
Dagade I mean just out of curiosity I said look			
here if you don't mind I would like you to tell me something about this			
Ah 			
And we just settled on one point that is China			
Ah 			
Because that is the one which can 			
 Yes yes you told me that you had been			
to China and there you			
 Yes haan 			
So he was just kept on it 			
In the meanwhile I he say Dr Dagade adviced me 			
 haan that I should get uh the vet 			
 haan and seek his opinion 			
 Haan 			
 Haan 			
So that we will be able to diagnose what is the			
problem ?			
I see 			
So he came uh and he said sir I think this is			
just old age 			
Ah 			
And I was not very much interested in torturing him at			
 this age 			
 Right ah 			
So I just went on feeding him whatever usual milk 			
 you take 			
 That's right 			
And uh a ju just allowed him to be 			
 that's right the way he can live 			
 That's right 			
Sick people will be 			
Ah nursing of it was necessary for a 			
 the last fortnight 			
Ah 			
Because I had to clean him ah every 			
uh twice a day and then every other day I had to give him a sort of a uh			
uh sponge bath or something like that 			
 Ah 			
But uh that was only for about a fortnight and the			
end was damn peaceful			
Ah 			
Even the earlier night he was alright because the last one uh			
 four days I think ah all that he could have life was			
in his eyes 			
 Ah 			
Ah 			
 Cough 			
He keep kept looking at us 			
So you just found him I mean dead or 			
Uh no 			
It just happened ah that the earlier whole			
day he was a bit uncomfortable moving sides 			
perhaps shifting sides 			
 Ah 			
 Ah ha 			
 Perhaps 			
Uh there were indications			
Uh no but then that was a sense of activity also			
Ah 			
Then the evening which he lived and then we put him			
in a small kind of a cradel like thing that I have got done for him			
Ah 			
And uh then twice or thrice that night I went to him 			
saw him ah breathing normally			
 Ah 			
Ah			
But one thing I didn't like was that he had not changed his			
position in which he was kept			
Ah 			
And then early morning I went to him to to find out			
what is to be done for him and then whether he needs cleaning ah			
 whether he needs water 			
 Ah 			
Ah 			
He was breathing 			
Ah 			
Then I went there and he just had a sort of a something			
like he uh a few words in Kannada 			
Ah 			
 A few words in Kannada 			
He must have just slept			
Ah he just ha he just belched once ah ah			
 without anything coming out of it it was dry thing			
 Ah ah 			
Ah 			
And uh then he did it again a bit of it			
 Just belched 			
 Haan 			
And then			
That was the end			
That was the end 			
So when I was very much in front of him ah he just			
slowily reduced his breathing 			
 Ah 			
 When did it happened 			
Ah 			
When did it happened ?			
This was on Saturday morning			
Saturday it's about almost a week 			
Ah yes because on Saturday I was on leave 			
Ah 			
But have you bought another pup ?			
Well I don't have			
Ah			
We have yet to think of it			
We have not given any thought to that ah let us			
see			
 Ah 			
Because you need it you see 			
Yeah we need it 			
 Of course you have been 			
We need it but 			
 It is a necessity 			
But Prof Goud there is other part of it also			
Ah 			
It involves certain amount of attention and other things			
Yes that is true 			
Ah so 			
But then the you see purpose why you kept			
 John for him so long 			
 Yes 			
Right			
Ah 			
So but I I also sometimes no feels guilty about him			
Ah			
In the sense I had to keep him chained 			
right or keep him indoors ah and then I felt well 			
was I doing a right thing ?			
 Right 			
 Ah 			
Yes yes			
Now once I had it him haan 			
 I had no option			
 Haan 			
Right 			
And you could not uh change his habits 			
After having uh 			
 I see 			
Ah 			
Let him out and I mean wander about freely 			
No that's no no that was not very easy but			
with difficulty I could have done it			
But then the trouble was he was kept indoors when he was			
strong and he could fight others			
Ah 			
Now at a later age when he was not so strong			
Ah 			
And perhaps he could not fight with other dogs 			
 right or tear them			
 Right 			
Ahn 			
Then exposing him to lot of unknown or stray dogs			
Right 			
And inviting infections for himself and for us			
 Right 			
Ah 			
Was not very desirable			
Uh 			
So that queston is at the moment not taken into			
account			
It is left entirely to Veena and therefore I'm 			
not thinking about it 			
She must have come back yesterday or			
Yeah she came last night 			
She came last night 			
And what about Vishvas has he 			
Vishvas has gone to Hyderabad now			
 Transfered 			
Ah ah 			
With his wife 			
Ah so he's posted there or ?			
No he's not			
He has for the first time gone for his divisional training 			
 ahn and the divisional training is supposed to be in his own			
division			
 Ahn 			
Right right 			
So since Hyderabad he's supposed to be his			
division ah South Central 			
 Ah 			
Ah 			
He has gone there and then he rang up			
Ah 			
He just told us that he will be uh back here			
somewhere on thirteenth or fourteenth 			
 One word 			
Uh 			
 That's his zonal head quarters 			
Zonal head Hyderabad is zonal head quarters 			
Ah incidently ah uh in your college 			
 uhn is there any possibility of finding a trustworthy painter			
 ?			
 Ah 			
 Uhn 			
Painters you mean 			
Painting the house 			
Uh yes I'll I'll try you see 			
No I mean I just			
 I'll tell you somebody			
Ah 			
Ah 			
I mean a man whom you know and who happens to be a student			
and he has been in the college for few ahn			
 Ahn ha 			
I think even in painting ahn uh some			
students have done a course in the I T I			
 Ahn 			
Really 			
I remember because ah I asked them causally			
you see 			
Ah ha 			
They come to me for admission or for one word 			
Ah you meet every student 			
Ah everyone who comes to me 			
So they tell me you see uhm what I mean 			
training they have had and or what job they do 			
 Uhm 			
Uhn			
And all I mean sorts of skilled hands are there			
Ahn			
Even including masons are there laughter for			
actually I mean working as masons 			
 I see really			
Or undertraining you see 			
I see 			
Because if some some of them 			
Uhn			
They are children of masons 			
Ah ha 			
Hello 			
Hello 			
Hello 			
 Haan good afternoon 			
Good afternoon			
How are you ?			
Yeah I'm alright 			
 Accha this uh did you convey that message			
about tin oxide ?			
Yeah I have conveyed to them 			
Ah			
Now the fifty k g might be a problem			
They are saying uh take hundred because for from the point			
of view of packing and transporting ah they are saying			
take hundred k g's 			
 Ah 			
But hundred 			
Can I ask them for airfreight hundred k g's ?			
Hundred k g is too big quantity you now 			
Ah that's what they are saying ah 			
 I've sent them a telex again			
 Ah 			
Yeah 			
To see what they are why they are saying that 			
No but then I can do one thing			
Ahn 			
If you can ask them to uh uh pay for the advance			
Ahn 			
I can also arrange the advance 			
 Nahi nahi they are not talking about money			
Uhm 			
They are not talking about money			
Yeah 			
They are only saying 			
 Haan 			
Fifty k g's will be hundred k g's will			
be economical 			
 Haan 			
Fifty k g's will not be economical 			
No for air freight fifty k g is okay for us			
 Haan no for you it is okay			
Yeah			
But there is some other implication there 			
haan which might increase the cost that is what I am worried			
 Haan 			
No but let them specify that no ?			
 Haan 			
Why there should be increase ?			
 Haan 			
Why there should be an increase			
No I've asked them why ?			
Yeah 			
So let them tell us uh I mean I got the message			
But I remember last time also they have airshipped fifty k g			
No no no that was the first time sometime back			
Yeah 			
When they first started 			
But they can also help us nahi nahi			
 second time			
 Nahi nahi 			
 Nahi nahi it's not the question of			
helping 			
Yeah			
They should do it 			
Yeah			
Unless they have specific problem			
 Haan haan 			
Which I have asked them to spell out			
Uhm uhm 			
 Haan 			
Ah 			
But in which case you know they what they say whether it is			
fifty k g or hundred k g haan it will be			
they will be able to air freight by the end of the next week			
 Haan 			
Oh but then what is the use ?			
Ah 			
You see by by end of this month I'll I'll get			
the consignmnet 			
Yeah by the end of			
See my worry is Ahn that between uh end			
of this month and uh second week of uh uh what is that uh January 			
 ahn I'll have problems 			
 Ahn 			
 Ahn 			
 Nahi what I'm saying 			
yeah if the air freight is end of next week			
 Yeah 			
 Haan 			
Air freight it takes about three days na ?			
But it takes about ten days for clearance 			
Is that ?			
Yeah			
 Haan haan 			
So now you see they have to immediately ship fifty k g			
Immediately they say it's not possible			
 Haan 			
See they can uh earliest they can dispatch before the 			
end of next week 			
End of next week is too long			
 Haan 			
So can you please ask them that you can also represent our			
problem no ?			
 Nahi nahi I've already represented			
 I'm saying it is an additional requirement			
 Haan 			
It is because as as of the time that'll be taken			
for the two fifty k g's to be received by them			
Yeah			
They want fifty k g urgently 			
But why at all they have shipped so late ?			
Ahn 			
Why at all they've shipped so late ?			
See when the L C was open ahn during uh first week			
of November			
 Ahn 			
Ahn			
They have shipped by end of uh uh November			
 Haan 			
So that has caused the whole problem			
Yeah yeah 			
But even L C must was not the first week of November sir			
Yeah 			
Any way that there is no point in my arguing with you			
Yeah 			
But the thing is this now they say by end of next week 			
 is 			
 But I I firmly believe that if you convince			
them on phone haan they will definitely ship			
fifty k g			
 Haan 			
 Nahi nahi nahi you see the point is			
 Haan 			
Uh this the material may not be available readily			
 Haan 			
Fifty k g's or hundred k g's 			
 Haan 			
So they have to make it and then send it			
 Haan 			
So that is why they've said next week 			
but 			
 Any way they've to manifacture it now			
 <[ > we're their regular customers 			
 Any way I've I've no I			
don't want to delay any further			
Yeah 			
Suppose they say next week should I ask them to go ahead ?			
Yeah you ask them to go ahead			
 Haan but hundred k g's you			
don't want ?			
No hundred k g's 			
But fifty k g's there might be some price			
implications I'm trying to verify why 			
See that is all negligible 			
No any way I'll come back to you 			
Ah			
Ah			
Ah 			
Okay 			
But it is you've to act very fast 			
No no I can't act faster than what I am doing now			
Ah 			
But only thing is you uh as soon as I get the 			
clarification for the price yeah I'll ring you up			
 Yeah 			
Okay			
Then you will have to comfirm to me yes or no 			
Okay 			
Okay 			
Thank you very much

Ah 			
So now our agent ahn has asked for a			
indemnity bond and hundred rupees stamp paper			
 Ahn 			
Ah ha

Yes			
We should ask the B H E L yeah to issue			
instructions to their bankers ahn that this cheque has been			
lost by in transit			
 Yeah 			
 Ahn 			
They will never do sir			
Ah 			
This government organisation ah ha they will

 Sir that I've asked 			
You know in my letter ah ha I've 			
told them very clearly ah ha that this cheque which was			
issued in June ninety-two has already lapsed ah ha because			
we are in December

Ah			
But they insist always ahn for an indemnity			
bond to be kept in their file 			
 Ahn 			
 Accha but then then why it is to 			
whomsoever it may concern why not in the directly in the favour of 			
 B H E L 			
 That comes in the one word 			
That comes in the narration if you see			
Uh I have got that uh yeah there is uhm			
 issued by the Bharat Electricals Limited			
 Yeah 			
 This is the standard 			
Yeah this is the standard format			
Instead of that we should address it directly to the			
Bharat Electricals			
No no this is the standrad format ahn ahn for			
any indemnity bonds for any government customers			
 Ahn ahn 			
 Accha 			
 I've been issuing it for municipal corporations and			
 all government institutions

This thing has never come to Bombay

Ah ha			
And Kumata street you know that uh yeah yeah

refused to take the envelop meant for ELPRO International 			
okay and the postal people must have just dumped it in the 			
undelivered parcels			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Ah ha 			
 Okay

 Yeah yeah even higher rate nobody is			
lending just now laughter 			
Because I'll tell you what has happened you know 			
 Haan haan haan 			
 TELCO is borrowing at twenty-four			
twenty-five			
 Haan haan 			
 To sab paisa udhar chala ja raha hai 			
 Accha 			
You know people are rather give to TELCO			
 than give outside at twenty-six twenty-seven 			
 Accha 			
See no all the money is going there 			
But you can give this particular total updation to			
anybody no 			
Which one ?			
Uh that it's a Zee Company			
 and all that			
 Yeah yeah 			
 Nahi but logonko kya mentality hai			
 TELCO deta hai to kuch problem			
 nahi na 			
Ah ha ha 			
 Accha another thing is that if you can get a			
bill			
 Ye infact jab ye auto			
recession hai 			
Yeah 			
 To if the TELCO is			
 if TELCO name is there yeah that			
should get secondary importance actually laughs 			
 Yeah 			
 Nahi lekin TELCO 			
 ka nam hai na 			
Yeah now of course that is a different thing 			
No I'll tell you what is happening you know many of			
 these finance companies			
 Ahn 			
 Haan haan ha 			
They are collecting I C D's from all these people			
 Haan haan ha 			
And lending to TELCO 			
Yeah 			
You know because TELCO doesn't take			
below one crore 			
 Accha 			
They are inter-related			
So they're making a pool and lending to			
TELCO 			
 Yeah they're making a pool			
Is it like that			
Yeah laughter 			
And they're doing pool cost to cost you know			
 Haan haan ha 			
The point one percent you know 			
Ah ha ha accha second thing 			
Yeah			
This Nagendrarao of Apple			
 Haan 			
Uh he contacted			
 Haan haan 			
For the same matter 			
Yeah			
And I told him			
You refuses na 			
I I told him point blankly			
Very good			
That that will not be possible			
Yeah 			
This is something like a badla chahi ye 			
laughter uhn so in that case yeah if at all 			
 he's asking me the exchange of some securities			
 Yeah 			
Yeah yeah			
I I I told him that better we we'll settle the			
account 			
Correct correct			
Uh 			
So immature jaisa act kare na			
Correct corect 			
Even this phono office no how much I've to call			
for this commission			
Ah ha ha yeah uh so			
I told him very point blank that if you don't give the			
commission accha I'm going to tell			
 ELPRO not to give you money again 			
 Accha 			
Is it uh Nagendrarao talked to you ?			
No 			
 Accha 			
Why he told you like that ?			
Uh no nothing like that but I thought that 			
whether he has contacted me directly or through you oh or			
 he has at least kept you inform something like that			
 He also lied 			
 Oh 			
 Nahi nahi nahi in these cases street smart			
you know 			
Ha ha ha 			
That you know about it			
Ha ha ha laughs 			
These Sindhi types 			
 Accha 			
You know what he thinks one word 			
Ha ha ha			
I told him that you will not exchange securities			
Ha ha			
He thinks I'm lying 			
 Nahi nahi nahi infact he was totally under			
the impression that if he talks to me he can convinced and he can okay the			
deal 			
Something like that 			
Okay he's a big shot kya 			
laughter 			
No no last last time also uhn uh there			
was a little bit resistance in the beginnig			
 Uhn 			
Yeah			
And at least then we also thought that okay we will have also			
to keep the relations			
Yeah 			
And			
Whom did you exchange last time			
Uhn ?			
You really			
No last time we exchanged na 			
Yeah 			
Yeah yeah 			
 Accha 			
We exchanged last time and last time then he reimbursed			
us TISCO some securities uhm in			
exchange of Auto Light 			
 Uhm 			
 Arre you gave him Kya ?			
 Nahi ye to that time we gave it			
 Accha 			
Uh but with the clearcut understanding ahn ahn			
 that this type of deal will not be entertained in future			
 Ahn ahn 			
 Accha accha 			
So whenever you'll be dealing in the securities			
please bear in mind yeah and how come your securities			
department is not aware that some securities are uh pledged 			
 wohi wohi haan pledged with some other			
person and will not be available for selling till this particular dates			
 correct and they are freely entering into any sort of			
deal yeah and then asking us to exchange some			
securities 			
 Yeah 			
 Wohi 			
 Correct 			
 Yeah 			
These guys I'm telling you 			
Ah			
Very poorly managed			
Ah ha ha 			
Now now also he is telling me like that only that if you			
insist on settling the account we can even settle the account			
 Haan 			
 Lekin apko interest dena hai to			
muzhe kuch kamana bhi hai to with that one I'm 			
requesting you that you please release this one karke 			
 Nahi nahi I didn't follow one word			
 again 			
Uh he says that now when I'm 			
borrowing from you yeah I've to earn also			
something uhm uhm and with that one uh this particular			
deal is giving me some good amount of profit ah 			
So if at all you are exchanging these securities I'll			
 be uh good in the market otherwise I will have to go back			
on my words 			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Ah 			
Tell him to go back laughter 			
These guys are all these all natak haan 			
Ha ha ha 			
 He's used the money for bill discounting 			
Ha ha ha 			
Not for uh this thing 			
Correct correct 			
So you tell him not to give the money 			
Correct			
 Two words 			
Let us see			
Uhn 			
Perhaps			
Anyway now he is acting smart because it is already due			
 na 			
 Accha accha accha 			
 Ekvees ko due hai na 			
Ha ha ha 			
Perhaps this Vivek Chaubal haan 			
or Nagendrarao haan some uh 			
somebody from these two they will contact you yeah 			
 to 			
 Haan 			
 Haan 			
 Yeah 			
 I'm putting my foot down			
Correct corect correct 			
You know what they are thinking is that I'm 			
refusing without asking to ELPRO 			
 Haan haan haan 			
Because you know sort of I they think that I don't want			
to exert and go to ELPRO and Company 			
 Haan haan haan 			
I told him this see professional company nobody			
 will do			
 This this this 			
This type of things are strictly business deal			
Yeah			
How can they are even I would have thought it twice even			
before to request			
Yeah laughter 			
No another thing I'll tell you no some banks exchange			
securities			
 Haan haan 			
But if they exchange they charge them for it			
Yeah yeah			
You know like supposing I take and overdraft from 			
let's say City Bank 			
Yeah			
And uh for every certificate that I exchange they charge			
some five hundred rupees 			
Exactly 			
Will they pay you ?			
Exactly 			
Uh ha 			
Uh 			
Give this idea to R K M 			
 Laughs 			
No any way R K M's coming on Sunday			
 Accha 			
 To till that time I've not			
commented any thing but I have given my indication that this is virtually			
impossible			
Yeah			
But I will open up just a topic as a sort of formality			
with R K Mehta			
 Chalega 			
Okay if at all he thinks that okay we've to keep			
the relations and we've to think otherwise 			
Yeah			
Okay then why why I should be bad in their eyes 			
laughs 			
Correct correct 			
But this is very unprofessional			
Correct correct 			
No it is not done normally			
Yeah yeah			
 Abhi aap baki ka one word 			
dekho na where we have had trouble			
Yeah yeah 			
In fact but Konthal got realized			
He got realized na 			
Konthal got realized			
 He's a thorough gentleman 			
Even the Tata two words that got realized			
 Accha 			
 I've absolutely no problem			
No problem			
 I've single transaction clean deal			
Yeah 			
And got settled 			
Correct correct 			
Uh with a word of thanks that's all			
 Ek hi isme kitna gadbad and 			
 gadbad hai 			
 And 			
Yes yes uh 			
At one time they have to give the tedious certificate and other			
time they have to give the post- dated cheque for the interest			
 at other time they have to exchange the security 			
 Yeah posing for the one or two words 			
 A few words 			
Capital and not interest no 			
Exactly laughs and so so many things			
Yeah that is true 			
 Chalo any way			
Uhn 			
See you 			
 Chalega 			
Uh but uh please officially talk to R K			
Mehta on Sunday			
 Yeah I've got it in mind yeah 			
Sure 			
Ahn

Thank you			
Thank you 			
Yeah 			
Okay I'll call him			
He want to go to airport from here to airport

But the flight was late			
Uhm uhm			
So that's why he has gone to campus 			
So 			
From from campus to he will go to airport 			
Uh to receive Shivaraj Patil			
Yeah 			
I see 			
So the from uh then uh from there he is going to 			
No he'll be there in the campus only 			
No today tere is a talk no			
But that is in the evening no			
Yeah 			
Uh he will go 			
Yeah okay then			
Okay 			
He has not come on the line 			
Hello 			
Uh good morning			
Good morning			
Uh you've been very hectic uh 			
Yeah I know even now I'm waiting for just 			
one word to the airport ah ha because that flight is 			
delayed			
 Ah ha 			
Yeah 			
Which you know four thirty 			
And where is he staying ?			
 Raj Bhavan 			
 Raj Bhavan 			
Now I called your residence			
Yeah			
I was told that you are going to airport			
Right 			
So uh you will be coming there along with him or			
No no no uhn he is going to Raj			
Bhavan 			
 Uhn 			
Ah			
 I'll come back to campus			
Uhm uhm			
Then uh I'll probably you know still little			
bit ahead of time			
Uh 			
And then somebody will go to Dr one word 			
will go to Raj Bhavan to bring him			
I see 			
I was looking at the airport uhm whether he			
wants anybody to come there			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
Or he'll come earlier			
Yeah 			
Now uh you see is the speech going to be recorded 			
No we wanted to record uhm the			
taperecorder doesn't seem to be working			
 Uhm 			
Uh			
Do you have a transistor recorder ?			
Uhn I've uh I don't have a transister			
recorder but you know my friend as you know Dr S V Shastri			
Uhm uhm 			
Uh he has come here for today			
Uhm			
And he is doing some U G C Project			
Uhm uhm 			
For which spoken English so he wants to record			
Uhm uhm			
So he has got a taperecorder and everything ah 			
so he was keen to record that 			
 Ah 			
Uh you see the he Shivaraj Patil's and the text			
of his speech is ready uhm and he's suppose to			
bring it to the airport uhm but still he will deliver it			
 yeah 			
So you can bring it it may be good if you can record it			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah but only I wanted your permission			
No it'll be a welcome uhm because			
university is saying this thing is not working ah so if you			
 maybe come a little bit earlier yeah then they can			
plug in and test it yeah because you that mike			
condition system we don't know			
 Uhm 			
 Ah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 That's right 			
So he'll be there before I will you know come with him 			
 ahn or he may come directly uh before four thirty			
 Ahn 			
Very good that'll be nice			
Uh so you will be there 			
I will be there and Muralidhar and Gosaval			
Yeah but your those people will have to be told			
Yeah oh yes I'll if I'm not there			
 uhm you'll have to wait yeah 			
untill Muralidhar yeah because he will be there till 			
everything starts			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
And he has got a very sophisticated system like in the T V			
 uhm the person you know if he puts that uh to his shirt			
 uh uh then the voice is recorded very accurately 			
That is how he recorded for the last time			
 Uhm 			
 Ah 			
No but in this in this case			
Uh 			
Uh I don't know whether that would be possible 			
We have a system whereby uhn see it is connected			
from the mike 			
 Uhn 			
Mike			
That type uhn that will be better			
 Uhn 			
Yeah			
Because he'll be speaking into the mike			
Yeah any way if uh will he will 			
 Let him bring it 			
Supposing his equipment has separate mike			
Uhm			
That also can be put it put there			
Yeah			
And we can put it somewhere some side table			
Uhm uhm 			
It will be good if he comes a little early uhm			
 so it can be tested			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
Sometimes uhm instruments of this and that			
won't match			
 Uhm 			
 That's right 			
So			
So I am going to airport okay that will be			
twelve thirty he is coming

Yeah very good friend of mine I mean he became 			
yeah I mean he consults me for every other subject or for every his			
personal difficulties with the other things also			
 Yeah 			
Yeah			
Yesterday he was here I mean 			
Yeah			
Day before yesterday			
Yeah right 			
And he comes every other day			
Yeah yeah ah 			
He is a very good student			
Ha he is a good student uhm very good student			
 right I know him ah			
 Uhm 			
But well I have started loosing interest in him			
because he says he is not going to be a teacher 			
He is not going to be a teacher 			
Teacher any more he says he wants to go back to his uh 			
 fields and go to grow some fruit garden			
 Village 			
Yeah yeah that is what his uh fancy there in his mind 			
Yeah			
I know 			
Even when he was for his B A 			
Uhm			
You know there was a farewell function yeah to			
be given to the students farewell to be given to the students			
 Yeah 			
Uhm 			
And then he made a speech over there ah 			
and said that he wants to do he was a good student

Uh he said that you know after B A he doesn't want to do M A			
 uhm and wants to go back to his village and do 			
agriculture and sort of things

pursue his studies and I thought of encouraging him taking			
Commonwealth Literature etcetera etcetera			
 But you know

At the beginning but then he gave me a shock the other day			
saying that only he will complete his M A with American Literature			
whatever he has in the first year			
Yeah ha			
And he will become an agriculturist

Because uhm it is not that you know all those			
people who study English language and literature that they should go in for			
teaching job			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
You know being an agriculturist is also nice and then

 Ha 			
 Accha accha nahi nahi 			
But you didn't send it ?			
No no 			
Then who ?			
There must be some other C P 			
 Someone else someone else laughter 			
So you must find out who is the other C P Thomas 			
 Who the other 			
Yeah yeah			
I was telling Sudha ah that there're 			
two or three other Prabhakar Paranjpe's in town			
 Ah 			
 Accha 			
Yeah one of them writes letters to the newspaper			
 Accha 			
And they are regularly published in the newspaper			
And others think you write			
Yeah some people think those who don't know my			
initials			
Ah ha ha			
Because he writes his initials Prabhakar G Paranjpe			
 Accha 			
And I'm Prabhakar N Paranjpe 			
 Paranjpe yeah yeah			
So those people who know my initials they 			
yeah they can make out			
 They 			
Ah			
But the others are mislead ah they sometime			
 and because I'm connected with journalism department			
 Ah 			
Yeah			
They laughter have feeling that as I did			
it 			
 They take it for granted that everyone in			
journalism has to write a letter			
Yes laughter 			
Probably probably laughter 			
Or only those who are connected with journalism their letters			
are published 			
Yeah yeah that is also there			
Yeah because for getting your letters also in print 			
 perhaps you yeah you need some pull			
 You should have to 			
I know			
Yeah 			
I was uh going to ask you something about uh research			
project			
Ah ha ha			
One of my friends			
Uhm			
Is doing a research project and he is collecting some			
 corpus of Indian English 			
 Accha 			
Ah and it is an international project 			
Ah ha			
He is doing the Indian part			
 Accha 			
But it is being collected this corpus is being			
collected uhm uhm all over the world			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Accha 			
And this is about world English 			
How English has flourished or developed as a world language			
Uhm uhm			
Uhm so this is called an international corpus of English 			
 Accha 			
And he was interested in getting some telephone			
conversation uhm uh taped			
 Uhm 			
 Accha 			
And use it as a part of the corpus			
 Accha 			
So uh I thought of you			
Yeah yeah			
As one of the prospective asking subject			
 Accha accha 			
And what they would need uhn is your			
consent also ha to use that uh conversation 			
 ha ha as part of the corpus			
 Uhn 			
 Ha 			
 Ha ha 			
 Accha 			
That is you've to tick off you've to			
give give some biographical information ah ha and also			
tick off your consent			
 Ah ha 			
 Accha 			
Uh so uh how do we do go about it ?			
Would you would you agree to do it ?			
Yeah I don't mind			
Ah			
I don't think this will be any problem			
Yes and			
My biography is nothing so great that laughter 			
Yeah I laughter 			
 That's true			
I can fill it myself			
Yeah			
And I can tick off myself that we are same			
Yeah that's right			
Your age group is twenty-six to thirty-three			
Yeah ah yeah			
 Ah 			
So even that I know			
Uhm			
And of course gender I know			
Yeah laughter 			
Highest level of educational attainment M Sc 			
and and B J B C J ah yeah and uh native			
language ?			
 And 			
 Ah 			
Uh native language would be Malyalam 			
Malyalam			
Uhm 			
Yeah 			
And other languages ?			
English Hindi and Marathi			
English Hindi and Marathi 			
Yeah 			
No other ?			
No other 			
Uh but which of these language do you use outside			
home ?			
English 			
Only English			
Yeah			
No other ?			
Marathi sometime			
Yeah Marathi sometime 			
Hindi and Marathi almost equal 			
Yeah English and Marathi almost equal			
Yeah 			
Uh and your primary education was through English			
English English			
English 			
Secondary education ?			
English only English			
English college through throughout English			
Yeah ah yeah 			
 Ah 			
Yeah and what about your father ?			
Uh he was educated in Malyalam 			
Malyalam			
Ah 			
Ah 			
And 			
Mother ?			
Mother also in Malyalam			
In Malyalam			
Yeah 			
Yes and			
They had English and Hindi as languages 			
In the school 			
Yeah 			
So they knew Hindi and English also 			
Yeah 			
Yes and uh what would you like to converse on ?			
Could you give some information about your job in say			
 uh how you started your carrer in Free Press and			
then migrated to Economics Times etcetera			
Okay that's right			
Uh so can you just now uh 			
You want it now yes okay			
 Yeah 			
Ah 			
So there was a uh Indian Express was			
starting its edition 			
Ah			
So they had called or 			
They were starting the edition in Bombay or Poona ?			
Poona Poona 			
 Poona yes 			
So they called uh students from our department			
Yes 			
For the written exam			
Right 			
After those who were qualified for that were called for an			
interview			
Yes 			
And interview was conducted by uh you want all			
that 			
Yes yes			
It was conducted by the now one word Mr Kardale			
 and one Patanjali Shetty			
Yes 			
So they said whether we would like to do sports			
reporting			
Yes 			
So I was keen on that also			
Uhm 			
So then after that uh after a month or so they said			
that they are taking as reporter here in Pune yes 			
 Indian Express 			
 Yes 			
Uhm 			
But that was uh they wanted me to join before my			
exams			
Yeah 			
So I joined in April nineteen ninety nineteen 			
eighty-eight 			
So till nineteen eighty-eight you join Indian			
Express 			
Yeah			
Yeah 			
As a trainee reporter			
Yeah 			
May first to fifteenth I took leave yes for			
the exams			
 Yes 			
Ah			
So I gave my exam during that time			
Right 			
Then I joined back			
Ah 			
Then what and the next thing was my result			
Yes 			
I got a first class			
Right 			
Then in October eighty-eight I married			
Yes 			
So after marriage Sudha went to Bombay			
Yes			
So she got a 			
 Job 			
 I also and that that time Indian			
Express was short of people in Bombay			
Yes 			
So for their desk ah Pune desk			
 Ah 			
Yes 			
So I asked for a transfer ah and I was			
given it immedietly			
 Ah 			
Yes			
So I went there			
But Sudha had gone over to Bombay earlier			
Yeah earlier 			
And how long were you alone in Poona ?			
Poona I would have been alone for say 			
Two three months 			
No one month			
Just one month			
Yeah within one month I managed everything			
Yes 			
Okay so			
Ah			
October fifth we married			
Ah 			
By November tenth I was in Bombay			
Ah 			
So 			
Ah 			
Then I joined the desk there ah as a			
sub-editor			
 Ah 			
Yes 			
And at the Pune desk			
Right			
And uh then Sudha got a job in Free Press			
Yes			
And I was conf I went on probation in			
November itself			
That is after your pe period as trainee			
journalist you were on probation 			
 Probation 			
Yes and provisional period was how long ?			
Three months 			
Three months			
Yeah			
Yeah and after completing the			
 Two or three months I'm not sure about			
it			
Yes 			
So after completing probation I became permanent			
Yeah 			
But on the desk the problem was later on it came			
that Pune edition unit every one will go for night shifts 			
Yes			
Some seven O'clock till twelve O'clock 			
everyday 			
That means everyday you would have been require			
to 			
 Everyday we have to do only that particular			
shift only			
Yeah 			
Because they didn't need for anything else			
Yes			
So I ask for a transfer to the Bombay desk			
Ah 			
So when I went to the Bombay desk uh they put me on			
two shifts			
one was the mid shift that is on two O'clock to eight 			
O'clock yeah and alternate we had night and this mid			
shift			
 Yeah 			
Yes 			
So that was also getting quite boring laughter			
 so I wanted to shift to that uh reporting			
Yeah 			
So at that time I was			
I think right from the begining your main interest was			
reporting			
Yeah reporting			
Not desk			
But I had gone to Bombay because 			
Yeah because you wanted the transfer to Bombay			
Yeah that's right 			
 That's why you accepted the desk			
Yeah that's right			
And I was not very su uh knowledgeble about all			
this that it was difficult to shift from desk to reporting			
Right			
So at that time I had written some sports copies from			
here from Pune for Indian Express 			
Yeah 			
They had a sports uh suppliment yeah 			
extra sport it was called			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
So Rajanbala was handling that and he knew I had written			
and uhm he had liked couple of thesis			
 Uhm 			
Yeah			
So when I was in Bombay he just came to know that I was			
there uhm and said Why don't you join the sports desk			
 ?			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
So I put in an application uhn to the			
news editor saying that I want to join the sports desk			
 Uhn 			
Yeah			
But they wouldn't leave me because they were short of			
staff on the desk as well as they didn't want anyone moving from			
there			
Yeah			
All petty yeah politics			
 Yeah 			
Politics 			
So I then he said no you have just come 			
No no was there politics between the say those			
who I mean the person who are in charge of sports desk and			
Yeah yeah there is lots of politics			
 Accha 			
Uh uh			
Although they had equal rank 			
Equal rank but they never let you like you don't give			
your personal interest			
I see ah			
You know that sort			
So you hold on to the persons who are working with you			
Yeah you hold on to the person for your ego problem 			
 yeah as well as staff shortage also			
 Yeah 			
Yeah 			
And moreover you don't see eye to eye with the other 			
laughter yeah 			
Yeah			
Basically because of that			
Uhm 			
Then he said at that time ke wait for five			
six months you have just joined then I will consider it 			
So I waited for six months and again I put an application			
Yeah 			
So he said no at that time the new R A had com			
 complained the converse haan so he			
directed it the application back to the news editor who said no			
 Haan 			
Ah			
So it was getting too much 			
Yes 			
For one month I just didn't go to office laughter 			
Without informing them 			
Without informing them			
Yeah			
And I made the rounds of all the newspaper offices down			
 there 			
 Yeah 			
At that time Daily was revamping they			
had a new editor			
Yeah 			
Rajat Sharma 			
Ah			
Who is this aap ki adalat 			
Yeah now he yeah 			
So he			
 Aap ki adalat 			
He had just taken over uhm and they were			
revamping and looking for more people			
 Uhm 			
Yes 			
So I just said take me as a reporter			
Uhm 			
Chief reporter there was one Mr Rangan			
Uhn 			
So he interviewed me and he said he found me okay			
Yes 			
Then he uh took me			
Uhm			
And I went without a pay hike also I just wanted to get out			
Yes 			
So one after when the month was getting over I just went			
in submitted my resignation in the off day yes from 			
Indian Express laughter 			
 Yes 			
Luckily I got the job yes that is what matter			
 Yes 			
Yes			
So I went there and I started doing beat nearly all			
the beats were handled by all the people who were already there			
Yes 			
He says one minute 			
About that uh mm letter sir 			
About uh that letter 			
Board of studies letter			
I gave it you no			
Yeah yeah			
I gave it to you yeah and uh you please			
check it up			
 Yeah 			
Yes Sir 			
Go through that uh paragraph yes sir and if			
you bring it back I'll get it typed then we'll send it 			
 Yes sir 			
Yes sir uhm yes sir 			
 Uhm 			
Uh are you coming now this side ?			
Yes sir I will come now			
Please talk for ten minutes I will come sir			
Ah accha 			
But uh uh the same drafting I can do na 			
 ?			
The dealing 			
The same type of			
That some of it are to be changed			
Okay sir			
Because yeah that is from my point of view			
 yeah and uh catering to my yes sir 			
requirements and needs perhaps yeah and probably I think uh			
you have to yeah change it a little bit ah ha			
 and project a little more ah ha about your own			
grievences or whatever fresh points are there ah ha that we			
have to put it down and then write isn't it ?			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yes sir 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Ah ha 			
 Ah ha 			
 Ah ha 			
Ah ha 			
Sir about that Chaya I received a letter from uh the director			
of uh uh school education that Chaya Katti uhm could you			
tell me something about it sir ?			
Even I don't know anything about it 			
 Uhm 			
See 			
Ah			
The nineteen eighty-six 			
Ah 			
 Called that national policy on I mean that			
New Education Policy is there isn't it ?			
 Programme of 			
Right sir 			
National policy of Education			
Yeah 			
Uh they have prepared a kind of uh programme of action			
 Pune yeah for the state			
 Right sir 			
 Yeah 			
 Haan 			
That is for the state they have prepared in nineteen			
ninety-three 			
Ah ha			
About that they want to finalise 			
Ah ha 			
And they have identified some people 			
Ah ha			
Uh in each department			
Ah ha			
And uh they wanted uhm that this person			
should go through the D O A draft which they have prepared at S C R T 			
 yeah and then to the governments and uh whatever additions			
deletions will be there ah ha they should make it and then			
hand it over 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Ah ha 			
Thats all 			
Thats all			
 Haan 			
And for that probably I think we did a kind of honorary			
job uhm uh but the new syllabus and new programme of			
action and whatever we decide ultimately ah ha will be the			
final one and should reach entire state 			
And the all the direction and all the ah ha			
 uh schools ah ha will be impleminting this particular			
kind of new contents that all we suggest the thing			
 Uhm 			
 Ah ha 			
 Ah ha 			
 Ah ha 			
I see			
Otherwise you know the programme of action actually what to do			
 ah ha that we have to suggest to them			
 Ah ha 			
Ah ha 			
They are keeping a book in the sense 			
It is in the book for			
No no programme of action nahi nahi you			
can you can recommend for preparation of new books 			
I see			
You may recommend for preparation of new contents 			
 ah ha a new methodology new approaches new A T or I T 			
 ah ha whatever it is uh yes whatever you suggest			
 uhm will be taken up uhm uhm then the			
action will be permitted 			
 Ah ha 			
 Ah ha 			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Who are the other members sir ?			
Uh from our college uh because that day I was there I			
gave all the names of our college first			
Ah ha 			
Uh Mrs Katon			
Ah ha 			
For minorities and or something like that I ask her			
Ah ha 			
Probably she must have been given minorities and only			
accepting that kind of strategy ah ha even that several			
 two words ah ha 			
Then myself 			
 Ah ha 			
 Ah ha 			
I see			
And for English uh Sharma			
Ah ha 			
Dr Sharma 			
Ah ha 			
And then uh uh Professor Venkateshwar Rao for Telugu			
Ah ha 			
And then uh like that quite a good number of people are			
drafted			
Ah ha 			
Uh professor Anwar Jahan for administration			
Ah ha 			
Is there any chapter on science education also sir ?			
Science education is there that was given to you 			
No sir they have given 			
 There are measurement problems 			
Evaluation means ah evaluation measurement			
 Ah 			
Yeah evaluation measurement must have been given			
You are you are dealing with education research also perhaps 			
 ah ha that's why			
 Ah ha 			
Sir before going to the meeting shall I read something and go			
or uh 			
 Nahi nahi not not necessary because			
content point of view ah ha there will be absolutely nothing			
 Ah ha 			
So need for pre no need preparation			
 No need 			
No need 			
I see			
Well you just go			
Yeah			
And uh you can discuss and prepare a kind of plan			
 for action			
Uhm uhm 			
What we should do ?			
You know they they want to know uhn what shall we			
do first of all			
 Uhn 			
Yes sir 			
And this these are the things which we you should do 			
that you are going to tell them 			
Right sir 			
And uh while telling uh that you will be uh			
already you have prepared a kind of draft or some directons they have given			
That is not uh open and one that is almost a special one 			
Right sir 			
Uh for the structure you have to give final consent 			
Right sir			
That you know this you should do this we should not do and			
ultimately you can say that this can could be taken up this could be			
 not be taken up etcetra			
I see 			
Now that you can complete that way 			
Today I have taken leave sir after taking first pay			
I know I know I understand I 			
As a first pay you know			
Infact somebody told me			
Ah ha ha 			
 That's why uh I was just asking you know 			
 ah what your tommorrow's programme ?			
 Ah 			
Yeah 			
By the by a very interesting information yesterday have you			
seen Eenadu ?			
Yes yes we have discussed already			
About Telegu University judge			
 We've discussed it we've discussed			
I want to go to the court today 			
You ?			
Yeah myself or uh someone uh who is known to us 			
 ah and we want to collect that judgement copy			
 Ah 			
Yes yes yes			
Yes 			
That we can manage			
Yes because they conducted interviews during elections			
 uhm so judgement gave in favour of uh not in favour			
of university 			
 Uhm 			
 That's okay but anything uh 			
 It's very positive point			
No which one which one is it conducting these elections			
are important ah or issuing the orders are important ?			
 Ah 			
Uh 			
Issuing the orders is the main thing isn't it ?			
Yeah			
That they should note out ah 			
Ah			
That part they have to stress not conducting the			
interview 			
Interview you can conduct at any time there's no problem			
Ah ha 			
That is that are for that also there are some restrictions			
 Nahi but you know we don't fall in that 			
in that provision that's all			
Because this is in September			
November and September yes 			
Elections uh held in November uh December			
Uh elections elections were last month November			
Uh December sir 			
Yes			
December first and December fifth 			
No no 			
They are telling			
No the elections notification came on first or second			
November isn't it ?			
Right sir			
Since 			
 Haan 			
Uh this uh as far as the severe circumstance			
they won't come under the perview of ah ha this category			
 Ah ha 			
But uh it seems Eiliah told to Tirupat that they			
should not no organisation should conduct interviews before three			
months 			
That we don't know because ah ha from the			
date of notification is of course we know			
 Ah ha 			
I see			
Uh date of notification came at what time ?			
Ah ha 			
Was it in September ?			
Notiification came in the month of July 			
No no no no			
 Haan 			
This notification must have come somewhere in the month of			
October or so			
Ah ha			
Exact dates you know 			
Ah ha			
Our first time elections were held in Andhra Pradesh 			
 yeah yeah that kind of notification 			
 Yeah yeah 			
And primarily you know the the issue orders were issued			
on fifth that is on the election day itself 			
 That is wrong 			
That is wrong			
That is wrong			
 Haan that is wrong 			
On the election day they should not issue 			
Yeah 			
And specially these elections the orders should not be			
given			
Uhm 			
Because the candidates if they are if they belong to			
a particular community or category or uh political party they the			
what you call the wave reaction will be there isn't it ?			
Uhm 			
A ripple of it 			
Yes sir 			
And the ripple of it goes to larger communities and then they			
begin claims and vote for this a particular section 			
Yeah yeah			
Thats how			
Uhm 			
These election orders also should not be given			
Ah 			
But they may argue they will say on first we have not given			
because ah on first uh the election in the city was there			
 Ah 			
Right sir 			
When they only ripple in the but in the Telangana region was			
there anywhere 			
Yeah yeah in entire north Telangana ah uh			
there was a that was election day			
 Ah 			
Uh then it is alright 			
And then we you have a chance			
Yeah 			
Because uh north Telangana means Osmania jurisdiction 			
one or two 			
Yes sir 			
Nizamabad			
Yeah 			
Ah ha then its alright			
Yes 			
Nizamabad comes under Osmania isn't it ?			
Yeah yeah 			
Not Kakatiya 			
Yes sir			
Okay then we can take it up			
Yes sir 			
Its okay then that part is that way			
Yes sir 			
Today what are your plans sir today ?			
Are you coming ?			
No somebody is coming ah ha at two thirty			
 Ah ha 			
 Accha 			
 I'll wait for them Shrinivas is here now			
Ah ha 			
And then you could have			
 That's great			
No now he has come back 			
Ah ha 			
I think uh he understood things			
Ah ha 			
He went to Namrata institution and was saying it all that			
Now he realised 			
A little bit not fully 			
Still uh of course its okay we'll slowly console			
him			
Uhm yes sir			
Sometimes some consolation should be given to him			
Yes sir			
And already one project is there in hand			
Yeah yeah C I R			
From that I can divert the funds to him			
Yes sir 			
Already he has done some amount also			
Yeah yeah of course there is uh only five or six thousand			
Yeah 			
Other thing also we can give what is there we've 			
the amount together yes but then unfortunately that thing			
is not working thats all 			
 Yes 			
Yeah yeah			
Uhn			
Yeah			
He needs money 			
Yeah yeah			
He is a brilliant boy but uh somehow ah ha			
 psycologically he is upset 			
 Ah ha 			
Ah ha 			
Thats the point			
Ramakrishna has come today ?			
No he is on leave today 			
Ah ha Ramakrishna is on leave			
I think so because he has not applied ah ha			
 he may apply tomorrow			
 Ah ha 			
Ah ha			
He may come and then say for yesterday I'm 			
giving his application			
I see 			
Because 			
Sir from Monday onwards I too want to take leave sir			
for four days because total I have five C Ls uhm so from			
Monday to twenty ninth 			
 Uhm 			
Monday is a holiday function day isn't it ?			
Oh Monday is a holiday 			
Maybe			
Ah then I can take upto thirtieth			
 Probably thirty is 			
Thirty first is a meeting			
Your total leave vanish from the camp			
Yeah laughter 			
We can think of that ah			
Yes sir			
You come we will discuss about it			
Yes sir 			
Not much ah 			
Yes sir 			
Okay then I will wait for you 			
Okay			
 Until then 			
Okay sir 			
Okay 			
Thank you very much 			
So proteins are the major BB-work 			
 food material that is the important food materials 			
which are use used for the growth and development of the			
 of body			
Either plant body or the animals body 			
So these proteins they are the macro molecules 			
Proteins they are the BB-work the macro molecules 			
So this these proteins can be the			
several kinds of amino acids 			
Several types of amino acids are present in the protein			
molecules 			
So in plants the amino acids they obtain from the inorganic			
process that's from that means it is from the 			
 atmosphere itself 			
The plants and also some micro organisms they have the ability to			
fix the inorganic nitrogen and to convert it into the amino acid form 			
But in the case of these animals they have to depend on the			
plants for the amino acid source			
The source of amino acids			
They have either they have to depend directly or 			
indirectly 			
What does it mean direct depe uh and the directly			
dependent means 			
 One-word 			
In the case of herbivorous plants uh sorry herbivorous animals			
 they have to depend on the animals they are depending on the plants			
for their foods 			
So they are getting direct ly the food materials from the			
plants			
understand 			
But in carnivores they are directly depending on the plants for			
their amino acid source 			
That means they are eating this uh flesh of other			
animals which are eating the plants or otherwise you can say that			
carnivorous animals they are eating herbivorous animals			
That means indirectly they we are getting the uh			
source of the protein from the plants			
Understand 			
So this amino acids are the made up of the			
components of the amino acids are also carbon BB-work hydrogen			
 oxygen and the nitrogen 			
Carbon hydrogen oxygen and the nitrogen			
And in some cases sulphur is also present			
In some cases the present of BB-work sulphur 			
BB-work 			
So there may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acids 			
bearing one or two amino groups 			
These amino acids may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acid			
bearing one or two amino groups 			
That means the you will you will not be know			
 knowing that a carbon atom has four valency isn't it 			
So these four valency for the carbon atom it is attached to one			
amino groups BB-work and to one carboxic group and to one			
hydrogen and one to the side chain one to a side chain 			
And the side can may be either polar or nonpolar 			
So every amino group is a so this amino acids may be they are			
of BB-work basic amino acids and acidic BB-work			
 and neutral amino acid BB-work 			
Basic then acidic and the neutral amino acids			
Then what does it mean basic amino acids 			
So every amino or group is known as the and amino acids			
having a free amino group is known as a basic amino acid			
For example lysine and arginine BB-work 			
So this lysine and arginine they have it they're having			
 one carbocil group and two amino group			
One carbocil and a BB-Work and two amino group			
That is why they are known as the basic amino acids			
And the acidic amino acids they are having one such amino			
group and			
Two carboxic groups 			
And two one Carbocil BB-work one			
amino and a two carboxic group			
 One 			
So they are known as acidic amino acid 			
So and another group they are having one amino group and			
one carboxic group N H D 			
 Carbonic group 			
One carboxic and one BB-Work they are known as			
neutral amino acids 			
For acidic amino acid for example glutonic acid and uh aspartic			
acids			
Glutonic and aspartic BB-Work 			
And for neutral amino acids examples glycine alanin valine 			
phenylalanine etcetera BB-Work 			
Glycine alanin valine etcetera 			
So these are the three main type of amino acids			
That is the basic amino acids acidic amino acid and the			
neutral amino acids			
Understand 			
Then if two amino acids can this these amino acids			
 can be linked together by means of peptide bond 			
Two amino acids they can be linked together			
Linked understand linked united together link 			
Together like by means of peptide bond peptide bond 			
BB-Works 			
So like that several peptide bonds to form a linear chain			
of many amino acids 			
Have you understood that chain			
The two amino acids they can be linked together by means of peptide			
bond			
So like that several bonds will be forming and like that a			
linear chain of peptide bonds can be formed 			
So these are known by the name together these are known as the			
 peptide			
It is together form a peptide BB-Work 			
So what is a peptide ?			
And what what will you say peptide what			
is it ?			
A peptide is formed by forming 			
 By the 			
Different parts of the 			
By by joining of 			
By forming pep several peptide bonds			
Understand 			
That is peptide bonds are formed in between two amino acids			
Two amino acids can be bonded together			
Or joined together by forming peptide bonds 			
So like that several amino acids will be united or bonded			
together to form a linear chain of amino acids			
They are known that amino acid molecule is known as the peptide			
A single peptide			
A peptide is formed by the bonding together of several peptide			
bonds			
Understand 			
That means several amino acids join together forming a			
linear chain of bonds known as the peptide bonds			
And these linear chains a of molecule			
contains a linear chain of these bonds they are known as the not a single			
 peptide			
Okay a single peptide is formed from several amino acids			
joined together or bonded together			
Understand 			
That is known as a peptide 			
So we will uh these proteins are micro molecules formed by 			
from a large number of peptide 			
That means a protein molecule contains the large number of these			
 peptide 			
But the function the the structure or the function will be			
different 			
The properties of protein will be different from the properties of			
a peptide or peptide bond			
Understand 			
That means the protein molecule contains several peptides 			
and also the peptide bonds but the properties of the protein			
differs from the properties of the peptide			
Understand 			
Uh we know that a protein molecule contains several peptides but			
the properties are different 			
 property of the protein is different from the property of the			
 peptide			
Understand			
But protein molecule contains several peptide 			
Then let us see the function of the functions of			
 amino acids BB-Work 			
So the main function is the they are the building			
blocks for protein			
 That means what what does it mean ?			
Main function building blocks for BB- Work protein			
The the main function is the building blocks for proteins			
That means several peptides or the amino acids are uh			
 constitute the protein molecules			
That means the main function			
And another is that is said the specific amino acids are			
also converted into different types of biologically active compounds 			
Certain specific amino acids they biologically convert to form			
several biological compounds 			
For example tyrocine it is converted into form of tyrocine			
is a amino acid BB-Work 			
It is converted into the form of known as tyrocine			
 BB-work 			
Tyrocine and a adrinalin that is also a harmone 			
BB-work 			
Adrinalin and another the skin pigment melanin			
That is also melanin BB-Work that is the skin			
pigment 			
Melanin is the skin pigment			
You know what is it skin pigment ?			
You don't know			
So that is the skin colour you know we have			
The the dark people or black			
They are having in their skin having the larger quantity			
of the melanin pigments 			
So the less melanin pigments have the fair colour 			
That is the present presence of these			
pigment only give the colour that is the black colour			
individually and melanin pigments 			
 Some In some cases we have seen that the people they are			
not having this melanin pigment			
Have you seen 			
So they are known by the name this such people they are known			
albino BB- Work 			
Albino 			
They are lacking the pigment			
They do not have this melanin pigment			
That is why they that means the these something			
 these amino acids or tyrocine will be lacking in their body for			
 for the conversion of this pigment			
For the production of this pigment			
Melanine pigment producing a materials 			
material for blacking blackening in			
their body 			
That is the pigment the total pigment 			
is absent in their body			
That is even then why their skin 			
 also is having white colour			
Isn't it ?			
Because our this uh our hair is uhm			
black due the presence of this melanin pigment 			
So in such people they do not have the ability to produce this			
pigment melanin			
That is why they look colourless colourless people or			
albino 			
So another uhm this plant harmone indole three acetic			
 acid and vitamin nicotinamide etcetera are also formed from a			
tryptophane BB-Work 			
The amino acid from amino acid tryptophane 			
These plants harmone known as indole three acetic acids			
 and the vitamin nicotinamide etcetra are formed BB-Work			
 Indole three acetic acids that is a plant			
harmone and the vitamin nicotinamide			
That is also formed from the amino acids tryptophane 			
So we know that the main constituent of the glucose is carbon			
hydrogen and oxygen isn't it ?			
So here in the amino acids carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen is			
also there			
So this here the N H group or the amino group is removed then it			
will be converted into glucose 			
And like that the carbo-oxyl group can be removed then it			
will form the carbon-dioxide 			
So these are the functions of amino acids			
Understand 			
So next is the nucleotides BB-Work 			
So these nucleotides are also complex molecules forming a part			
of the information transfer system in the cells 			
The inform what is information transfer system			
 ?			
What does it mean ?			
The transfer of information from cell to cell or nerve			
 from the nerve impulses like that that is the information 			
transfer system			
The information will be transferred from cell to cell that is			
the information transfer system 			
So they the they are the basic			
units of nucleic acids also			
You know that nucleic acid 			
Which are the main nucleic acids ?			
The D N A and the R N A			
 D N A 			
What does it mean ?			
D N A means what does it mean power 			
deoxyribo nucleic acid and R N A ribose nucleic acid 			
 Power 			
 Ribose 			
So the basic unit of nucleic acids are the 			
nucleotides 			
So these nucleotides also contain carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen			
and phosphorus			
A nucleotide when are contained contains 			
 carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and a phosphorus			
So each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base			
apendo and one two three phosphate group 			
Each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base			
 apendo and uh one two three phosphate group 			
So the the nitrogenous base is BB-work 			
occurring in nucleotides are they may be either purine or 			
pyromidin BB-writing 			
So then nitrogenous bases occurring in the nucleo tides			
are they may be either a purine or a pyromidin 			
So the major purines are adanine and a guarine 			
BB-writing 			
So this the major purines are adraline and a guarine			
And pyrimidins are BB-writing thymine uracil			
and the cytocin			
Thymin BB-writing uracil and cytocin 			
So this uracil is present in the R N A isn't it ?			
Uracil that is seen in the R N A 			
So the apendo is either ribose or deoxyribose 			
The apendo that may be either ribose or deoxyribose 			
So the nucleo tides are thus called the ribonucleotides or			
deoxyribonucleotides 			
So if a nucleotide contains ribose the apendos then			
we will say it is a ribo nucleotide 			
And if it contains a deoxy ribonucleo tide then it is			
known as the deoxyribonucleotide 			
For examples of ribonucleotides are adrinalic acid 			
adrinalic acid BB-writing 			
Adrinalic acid is an example for ribonuclei nucleotide			
An example for deoxyribonucleic nucleotide is the 			
deoxyribo nucleic acid that is the deoadrinalic acid 			
Deoadrinalic acid BB-writing 			
So adrinalic acid is an example for 			
Yes 			
It is an example for the 			
Uhn 			
Adrinalic acid 			
It is the example of ribonucleotide 			
Ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide example 			
deoxyadrinalic acid 			
So this ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic acids			
or R N A 			
The ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic			
acids that is R N A and also deoxy nuc uh			
ribonucleotides are the basic units of deoxyribonucleic acids 			
So that is the D N A 			
Say a combination of these nitrogenous base is the pentosugar			
 is known as a nucleo tide 			
So what is a nucleotide then ?			
Nucleotide BB-writing nucleotide what is it ?			
A nucleotide is formed by the combination of a			
nitrogenous base with a pentose sugar 			
 A nitrogenous base 			
That is known as a nucleotide 			
Today we are study studying			
 about			
rotation and revolution of the earth 			
I believe you know there are two forces two 			
motions of the			
earth 			
One is on its own axis and the other is 			
?			
Around the sun			
Around the sun 			
The motion on its own axis is known as 			
 Noise 			
What is known that motion is known as 			
 BB- Work			
 rotation of the earth 			
Earth 			
And the movement of the earth round the sun 			
 is			
known as 			
 Revolution 			
Revolution of the			
Earth			
Earth 			
Now what time does the earth take to take 			
one turn on its			
axis ?			
Twenty-four hours			
Twenty-four hours 			
Is your answer complete ?			
Twenty-four hours or less than that ?			
Sir twenty-four hours 			
It is twenty-four hours with reference to the			
sun 			
But if you take it with reference to			
any other star			
 then it will be less than twenty four hours			
 			
 Twenty-four hours 			
Say for example this one here 			
We are taking this as a reference point this			
side 			
And then want wanted this much			
 in			
twenty-four hours			
In less than twenty-four hours			
But in twenty-four hours what happens ?			
The earth moves a little around the earth			
Because in three sixty-five days the earth has to			
Complete 			
Complete one movement 			
 Twenty-four hours 			
So naturally one day if it is a three			
hundred and sixty			
degrees BB-Work 			
Then one day roughly we have three sixty 			
BB-Work five			
days BB-Work 			
But let us say this is three hundred and sixty			
degrees then			
 it will take roughly uh four minutes less			
 than			
twenty-four hours 			
Because in but we find actually uh 			
say every			
fourth year is a big year is a leap			
year 			
Leap year 			
Means one day is added and in one day			
 we say the			
earth takes one turn but this is with reference to any			
particular say			
this window in this case 			
So with reference to window but in one day			
the earth has			
advanced a little and this way second day uh say two			
minutes third			
day three minutes and this way in one year three			
hundred and sixty			
degrees			
It has moved round the sun 			
So naturally if we take this this way three			
sixty degrees that			
is one minute or better put it this way BB-Work			
If it is three sixty degree also means BB Work			
 in one day			
 one degree 			
One degree makes a difference in time of			
four minutes 			
 BB Work 			
We have noted fifteen degrees making a			
difference of BB			
Work one hour BB-Work 			
 One hour 			
So one degree will make a difference of how			
many minutes ?			
Four minutes 			
Two 			
Four minutes BB Work 			
Fifteen degree divided uh say BB work			
 sixty			
minutes sixty sixty minutes dividing this so			
 four			
minutes 			
 Sixty 			
 Four minutes 			
So one degree makes a difference of four			
minutes			
Four minutes			
Means every day the earth has to turn 			
one degree			
 in order to face the sun 			
Suppose it is here this day next day it will turn			
this 			
Next day again this much 			
This much 			
One degree every day BB- Work 			
So with reference to any other star our			
day is less			
than twenty-four hours and that is 			
twenty-three hours and			
 Twenty-four hours 			
Half of			
Fifty-four minutes 			
Twenty-three hours and fifty-four minutes 			
BB-work 			
So what is this state ?			
A day of twenty-three hours and fifty-four			
minutes 			
That is called sideral day BB-Work			
Sideral day 			
One degree less than twenty-four hours and			
then we have			
another solar day that is of twenty-four hours			
 that is of twenty-four hours 			
So we have two kinds of days one with			
reference to any			
other star of universe twenty-three hours fifty-four			
minutes 			
and we have another day with reference to the sun that is of			
 twenty 			
 four hours BB-Work 			
 Twenty-four hours 			
You also know that the earth's 			
axis is inclined			
 towards BB-Work 			
The earth is moving round the sun and the			
 earth's			
 axis with reference to the plane of orbit or			
orbital plane 			
also called elliptical plane or plane of ecliptic			
 BB-Work			
Plane of elliptic 			
This is an imaginary plane 			
Let us say this table is a plane and			
 on this plane			
 the earth's axis is inclined this way 			
Like this here 			
So this is an imaginary plane in this case here			
 near the			
table 			
But in that space a plane like this is there			
 and the			
earth is occupying this kind of position and then sun in			
the middle 			
So with reference to this imaginary plane that is			
 plane of			
ecliptic 			
Plane of ecliptic 			
Ecliptic BB-Work 			
The plane with reference to the plane of ecliptic			
 or orbital			
plane BB- Work 			
The earth's axis is inclined how			
many degrees ?			
Let us say this is the plane of ecliptic 			
and it is like			
this BB-Work 			
So this inclination how many degrees ?			
Cannot be ninety 			
Forty 			
Forty-five degrees			
Fifty fifty			
 Fif 			
This is 			
Forty-five degrees 			
 Sixty-six and half degrees 			
Sixty-six and half degrees BB-Work 			
Like this 			
If this is the plane of ecliptic this point see			
this 			
BB-Work 			
This is exactly here if you put it this way			
 			
BB-Work 			
Much inclined			
From vertical it will be twenty-three and half			
 BB-			
Work 			
This is sixty-six and half BB-Work 			
and this is 			
twenty-three and a half BB-Work 			
Together ninety degrees 			
So with reference to the plane of ecliptic 			
the 			
earth's axis has an inclination of sixty-six and			
half degrees			
But when you take it from perpendicular this is the			
plane of			
ecliptic then perpendicular then from there if you take			
this angle then			
it will be twenty-three and half 			
So you can express it this way with reference			
to the plane of			
ecliptic the earth's axis BB-Work has			
an inclination			
of sixty-six and half degrees 			
But from perpendicular drawn from the plane of			
ecliptic 			
the earth's axis has an inclination of 			
twenty-three and half			
 degrees 			
 Twenty-three and half 			
Now there is a one question 			
 BB- Work			
Here BB-Work say this is the			
plane of ecliptic			
 BB-Work 			
We have a arc BB-work here 			
BB-Work 			
And we have this inclination BB-Work			
 			
You might have studied this kind of things			
sometimes 			
BB-Work 			
Must have you studied 			
Four positions of the earth BB-Work 			
round the 			
sun 			
So sometimes you find this kind of 			
diagram 			
BB-Work also sometimes you find BB-Work 			
this kind of			
diagram BB-Work 			
Also sometimes you find BB-Work this			
kind of diagram			
Now which one is correct ?			
Sir 			
The first one because of the			
Why do you say the first one is correct ?			
Give arguments 			
 One word 			
Now let us see and one more 			
BB-Work 			
When you have like this ?			
 A few words 			
 BB-Work 			
Why ?			
 A few words 			
Sir earth is the 			
May be slanting			
The earth's axis is inclined			
Inclined 			
Uh 			
Uh			
With reference to the pe at twenty			
Twenty-three			
And half it has perpendicular			
From perpendicular 			
From the axis			
Here what is the case ?			
Um revolves uh but			
Yes ?			
The axis of the earth is uh 			
revolved			
What do we mean by sixty-six and half			
degrees from the			
plane of ecliptic BB-Work 			
This is the plane of ecliptic for our purpose here			
We are measuring this 			
This is imaginary now remember 			
Here we have salved it so sixty-six			
and half 			
If we put it here is it not sixty-six and half			
 ? 			
BB-Work 			
Measure this angle BB-Work because			
this is plane 			
imaginary so measure from here 			
Is it not sixty-six and half ?			
Yes it is 			
If you put it here 			
Again the difference again after the			
You measure from this side 			
So it may also be there			
Yes sir 			
So what about this ?			
Is it correct ?			
This is correct at least because we put it this way			
Yes sir 			
So it's like this			
The position has changed			
So this is correct 			
Right ?			
Yes sir 			
If you put it this way what is wrong ?			
 BB-Work 			
Measure from this side 			
One sixty-six and half 			
You put it here 			
Measure from this side sixty-six and half 			
From here same thing sixty-six and half			
So is it not correct ? BB-Work 			
This much 			
Why do you say that this is correct this is wrong ?			
 One or two words 			
And what about this ?			
Look at this one 			
Twenty-three and half degree and with a			
correct size			
Correct 			
But where do you find twenty-three and half degrees			
 or			
sixty-six and half degrees			
Do you find here ?			
But it is 			
How ?			
Let us see 			
Here put it this way sixty-six and half			
degrees but from			
your side it is appearing perpendicular			
Perpendicular			
But it is at sixty-six and half 			
Is it at ?			
It is at sixty-six and half 			
Not			
Here also sixty-six and half 			
But from your side it appears perpendicular			
Uhm 			
So one way this is also correct 			
But what about this ? BB-Work 			
Some are like this some are like this 			
So what is needed they all must be 			
 inclined			
 in the same direction 			
 Inclined 			
 Direction 			
They must be inclined in the same			
direction 			
 Same direction 			
But otherwise all these three are			
correct 			
How many days the earth or what time the			
earth takes			
to take one round around the sun ?			
Sir days or days			
Days or time better say time 			
 Sir three sixty-five days 			
Three sixty-five days			
Three sixty-five days 			
Is it ? BB-Work 			
Yes sir 			
Once a year 			
Once a year 			
 BB-Work 			
Because we have a longer year after four years			
So it it is also one			
fourth 			
BB-Work of a day 			
 Noise Long pause 			
Now let us see if this is the position			
 of four			
positions of the earth round the sun 			
Then you also know that two days in a year 			
the sun's			
 vertical rays strikes at the equator 			
We have noted 			
Two days in a year 			
What are those days ?			
Yes			
December twenty-second noise 			
 BB-Work 			
Two days in a year the sun's 			
vertical rays 			
strikes at the equator 			
Means the days and nights are equal all over			
the world 			
Sir sir twenty-second December 			
Twenty-second December and it is also in the			
 one or two			
words 			
When do we have longest day in			
India or here ?			
Twenty-first twenty-one twenty-second June			
twenty-second			
Let us take twenty-second BB-Work			
 June			
Sir twenty-first June BB-Work 			
Okay twenty-first June BB Work 			
The day is longest in northern hemisphere 			
Means where does the wait let us say take			
also when			
do we have the shortest day ?			
Sir January twenty-second December 			
February 			
 Exactly the after six months 			
 Sir twenty-second December 			
Sir twenty-first Jan			
It should exactly be after six months			
 Exactly after six months 			
Sir Twenty-first Jan			
It should exactly be after six months 			
So it cannot be January 			
Sir December 			
Sir December sir December			
What date ?			
Twenty-second December			
December twenty second okay BB work			
Sometimes uh one also writes twenty-third 			
December 			
So from twenty-fourth December bada din			
 			
BB work 			
We have Christmas on twenty-fifth 			
So say it may also be twenty-third December			
 BB Work			
So this is summer season in India 			
This is summer BB work 			
Summer of northern hemisphere BB work 			
This is winter of 			
Northern hemisphere 			
 Northern hemisphere BB			
Work 			
Now you tell when do we have 			
vertical rays shining			
at the equator 			
It must be also in between 			
So what may be the dates ?			
When the sun's vertical rays fall 			
or strike 			
on the equator or at the equator ? BB Work 			
Sir March 			
Twenty-third March 			
 BB Work 			
Twenty-second twenty-third 			
twenty-first 			
 Twenty-first March 			
March 			
Any other day ?			
No sir			
No sir			
Sir March fifth 			
After six months what date it may be ?			
Sir September September twenty-second			
 So twenty-second September 			
Twenty-second September			
 BB Work 			
Now if this is the case where will you put 			
these days 			
Four days we have now BB work 			
One BB work this BB work			
 here 			
BB work here BB work 			
Put it this way BB work one two three			
 BB			
work and four BB work 			
Where will you put twenty-second December 			
?			
What happens on twenty-second December ?			
Where does the vertical uh ray of			
the sun 			
strike ?			
At the tropic of cancer at the tropic of			
capricorn ?			
Capricorn 			
So this is tropic of capricorn vertical			
rays striking			
here 			
And the southern hemisphere south pole has 			
day for			
six months BB work 			
See here BB work 			
 Sun's rays are vertical at the			
tropic of			
capricorn 			
Yes			
And all these areas are under sunlight 			
So this position will be from which			
date ?			
Twenty-second December 			
 December 			
 BB Work 			
What is the position here ? BB work 			
Sir twenty-third uh twenty-first June			
Twenty-first June 			
Right			
Sir ternty-second June			
Okay twenty-second June BB work 			
It all depends upon because sometime you have leap			
year sometime			
you do not have			
So it may be twenty-first it may be twenty-second			
And sometime people even write twenty-third 			
So that doesn't make much difference 			
 BB-Work 			
So the last time we had studied the external structure of heart			
Mammalian heart 			
Today we are going to study about internal internal			
structure BB-Work 			
 Internal 			
As you know that the mammalian heart it is four			
chambered BB-Work 			
Can any one tell me which which are these chambers 			
are ?			
Auricles and ventricles 			
Yes very correct 			
Two auricles			
Two auricles BB-Work two auricles and two			
ventricles 			
Which chambers are called as auricles ?			
Say clearly 			
The upper portion 			
Which are the auricles ?			
Upper portions are auricles			
Yes very correct 			
The upper portion the upper chambers are auricles 			
 BB-Work and the lower ones are ventricles			
Ventricles 			
In the same way these auricles auricles are usually 			
are very thin wall structures BB-Work whereas the			
ventricles are very muscular 			
Each side of the auricles and ventricles they are			
interconnected the left side and the right side 			
Now they are interconnected by an aperture common aperture 			
which are known as auricular-ventricular aperture BB-Work 			
It is internal effecting through auricles			
No auricles auricles and ventricles			
 noise 			
 Auricles 			
 Auricles and ventricles 			
Now these auricles are guarded by valves which			
 prevent prevents the blood flowing again			
 on the same side or going back into the ventricles or auricles			
Or you can say that that it prevents			
the back flow of the blood 			
The left side auricular-ventricular aperture here in this			
diagram you can see 			
It is guarded by a valve which is known as bicuspid valve			
Bicuspid BB-Work bicuspid valve or you can 			
call it as a mitral valve also BB-Work 			
What is it function what			
To prevent the back flow of the blood from auricles to			
ventricles 			
Similarly the right auricle and the ventricle is again			
guarded by a valve which is known as tricuspid valve tricuspid			
valve BB-Work 			
These valves are very strong and made up of muscular tissues			
 which open into the of course of ventricular side			
 and to keep it there keep the flap as it is it is			
 held up by some tissue chords which are known as 			
collisentinel collisentinel BB-Work 			
So this is the internal structure			
Now how does working of the heart takes place ?			
By left and right ventricle aperture they may be 			
Left side takes the bicuspid and right side the tricuspid			
Auriculars 			
Auricular-ventricular aperture 			
Left side this side entering			
That means that left side auricular-ventricular 			
aperture is guarded by bicuspid valve and the right side of the			
auricular-ventricular aperture is guarded by tricuspid valve BB-Work			
The two auricles act as a reservoir of the blood which			
 collected from the side of the all sides			
of the body 			
It comes and get stored in the auricles 			
From auricles then it goes to the ventricles and then			
ventricle when it contracts it gets closed into the vessels 			
This is the general working of the heart 			
BB-Work 			
Auricles when the auricles contract the blood flows			
into the ventricles and when the ventricles contract the blood flows			
into the vessels 			
Which are these vessels can any one tell me ?			
 BB-Work 			
From the le left side from the left it goes			
to the pulmonary pulmonary vessels BB-Work 			
What do you mean by pulmonary ?			
Going towards lungs BB-Work 			
Then what about systematic arteries ?			
 BB-Work 			
Systematic artery are the main vessels which supply blood			
to the body organs different body organs 			
Now these vessels also as it opens into the ventricles of			
their own side in the vessel itself it also contains or it also based on			
that which are known as cellulilar glands BB-Work 			
In this diagram here see this is the in 			
systematic this is pulmanory and this is described here 			
Now the blood which comes to the right auricle it			
comes from different parts of the body			
That means it should be definitely veinal blood 			
What do you mean by vienal blood ? BB-Work 			
Into the 			
De- oxygenated de-oxygenated 			
BB-Work 			
 Oxygenated 			
This is a degenated 			
Pardon me 			
Degenated 			
De 			
Genate 			
De-oxygenated blood because it will go for purification to			
the lungs 			
Except one vein which brings purified blood			
Which is that ?			
That day I have told you about it 			
Pulmonary 			
Pulmonary vein 			
Though it is called as vein but it brings oxygenated blood			
 because the direction of flow is towards the heart 			
But it carries oxygenated blood 			
In the same way the pulmonary artery which is going away from			
the heart that other aor this aorta 			
But these carry veinal blood why ?			
Or these carry de-oxygenated blood 			
Why ?			
Can you tell me ?			
Then why the name has been given as aor aorta ?			
Only because the direction of flow is towards the body organs			
Away from the heart 			
Now which are these two veinal blood systems are ?			
Which is here this blue one superior and inferior venacava			
 BB-Work begins superior inferior venacava BB-Work			
end 			
The superior venacava brings de-oxygenated blood from the			
 upper portion or head region of the body BB-Work 			
Head ante anterior against these 			
De-oxygenated 			
And inferior means from the lower portion of the body			
 BB-Work 			
These two aortas open into the right auricle 			
Then when the auricle contracts it goes to the right 			
ventricle 			
Then from ventricle when it ventricle contract the blood goes			
 into the vessel 			
From right auricle which vessel it will go ? BB-Work			
Pulmonary vein pulmonary artery			
Pulmonary 			
Artery			
Artery yes 			
Which will take the blood to the lungs for purification			
In the same way left auricle receives blood purified			
blood from the lungs 			
As it contracts the left auricle oxygenated blood			
then goes to the left ventricle 			
And the ventricle after contraction it takes blood			
through the vessels to to the different parts of the body 			
or main systematic arteries BB-Work 			
But aorta and uh sorry uh auricles and the ventricles 			
they contract together or the auricles they will contract at at			
the time 			
So the working of left and the right auricle will be going as			
I have just explained you 			
Ventricles also contract at the same time 			
Both the ventricles 			
 And the working 			
 And they are undertaking 			
No no two two together 			
Auricles first then ventricles 			
How many times this contraction takes place ?			
Seventy two uh 			
 Seventy-two uh good 			
 Seventy-two times 			
Seventy-two times 			
Can you measure it ?			
Know there is some instrument 			
Electrocard iogram 			
Stethescope BB-Work which helps in 			
Miss what is the meaning of electrocardio gram 			
 Counting the sounds of this contraction			
Miss what is the main function of electrocardiam 			
That spinal 			
That function of E T P radiocardiam 			
That is electron 			
How to count these in the first medical you have to first			
count these lub and dub sound BB-Work 			
Lub and dub sound 			
Lub 			
And if you want to count it by your finger tips you			
can 			
There is pulse rate 			
Pulse yes pulse rate you can just near the thumb 			
I mean the pulse is 			
No no I mean			
 Left hand 			
Here it is this count near the thumb thumb side			
portion this is BB-Work 			
Now there are two types of these veins also			
Now the ephatic portal vein and the one more is			
there portal vein renal portal ephatic portal 			
BB-Work 			
What do you mean by the portal vein ?			
Why not it is simple vein ?			
Portal vein ?			
Because this vein is not directly going to the heart but			
it goes through some one of the organs 			
There it gets filtered on the nitrogenous amonic			
material and from there then the simple way to go to the heart 			
from heart then it goes to the lungs for purification 			
So there are two portal veins hepatic portal vein and			
the renal-portal vein 			
 Hepatic portal vein goes to the liver 			
BB-Work liver for filtration that is nitrogeneous material			
And renal- portal the filtration takes place in kidney			
 for amonic material 			
Again that would be the procedure only 			
So in this way there are two portal veins and different			
types of veins in the body which help in collecting the different 			
veinal blood and then getting stored in the auricle 			
Which auricle ?			
It will come to which auricle ?			
Main vein 			
Right auricle			
Right auricle correct 			
Have you brought your text book today

Fourth one			
Fourth one is acid 			
Now sir sir turn the page			
Page number sixty-eight they have given the words here 			
scientist acid gas burner and flask			
You have already told the those names here 			
Now the just look at the B 			
What is this a picture of ?			
 Sir sir 			
P C Ray 			
P C Ray because they have already mentioned there			
Name is given there P C Ray 			
Now what is the scientist doing there ?			
Experiment 			
Not in all			
Only group wise 			
The scientist is doing experiment experiment			
correct 			
 Experiment 			
Then just I will read the lesson loudly Teacher			
starts reading 			
 P C Ray 			
The neighbours did not know what to make of the young man 			
That he was a college lecturer and scientist they knew 			
And he did experiments in small laboratory he had set up at his			
house 			
But what scientific purpose could he hope to serve by dumping on			
terrace sackfuls of cattle bones he had got from the local butcher 			
They had put up with the odours that had often been wafted to them			
by breeze from his laboratory 			
But the stench from rotting bone and flesh was unbearable 			
Crows had also been littering houses all around with bones picked			
up from te terrace 			
After several days of this they could stand it no longer 			
They told the young man to take away the bones 			
If he did not they would call the muncipal authorities 			
At this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 			
He had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house 			
end of reading 			
 Yeah 			
 Starts reading 			
At this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 			
He had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house and the			
 bones could be dumped there 			
That was done and one evening when he found that the bones had			
been well dried by the sun the young man made a bonfire of them 			
There was trouble again 			
Policemen attracted by the fire arrived and he had a hard time			
convincing them that he was no murderer destroying evidence and			
that it was not human bones that were being burnt 			
The next morning he took the ashes of the bones to his laboratory			
and treated with them sulphuric acid 			
When the superphosphate of lime thus produced was mixed with soda			
 a solution of phosphate of soda was formed 			
The solution was then put into large basin and boiled 			
This produced lumps of phosphate of soda crystals 			
The young man took a lump and chewed it 			
He smiled happily 			
He had converted the waste cattle bones into a medicinal compound			
from which nerve tonic could be made 			
The young man began to produce the tonic on a large scale 			
It was cheaper than the imported product available in the market			
and was as effective 			
In the beginning druggist were not ready to keep this desi			
 medicine but doctors who knew the young man and the			
effectiveness of the tonic canvassed it and it became popular 			
This was the modest beginning of the Bengal Chemical and			
Pharmaceutical Works now one of the biggest chemical firms in the country			
 and the young man was Prafulla Chandra Ray			
Today Ray is recognised as the father of India's chemical			
industry 			
And he not only developed centres of research in chemistry and			
trained brilliant young chemists but also by original research placed			
India in high position in the world of chemistry end of reading 			
Now read the lesson silently for three to four minutes			
Now in this what happens we have to take ammonium			
chloride and clay lime in the ratio of three is to 			
two 			
What is the ratio ?			
Three into to two			
Now this I will arrange as in shown in the			
Figure			
See in your figure 			
Now we heat the test tube and we pass it the gas is allowed to			
pass over this line tower			
Why ?			
Because when it pass through line tower the ammonia becomes dry			
It helps in drying ammonia 			
 Ammonia 			
Now as this gas is lighter than air it is collected by 			
the gas jar is kept inverted over the line tower and			
the gas is collected			
 Line tower 			
Have you understood ?			
Yes			
Now we take this is by we collect by the downward			
displacement of			
Air			
Now we check some of the physical and chemical properties			
of the gas 			
Now first physical property			
We see that it is has no colour			
Inside is colourless gas 			
 Gas 			
Then the smell is strong 			
It has a high strong smell 			
 High strong smell 			
Teacher noise 			
Then 			
So we can say 			
What can we say about the smell that it is the pungent 			
smell 			
 Smell 			
 What how it is smell ?			
Pungent smell 			
Then the next property is it is lighter than air			
We have seen in collection of when we are collecting the gas			
 we are collecting by the downward displacement of air 			
 Air 			
So it is naturally lighter than air 			
 Lighter than air noise 			
Now this gas is also soluble in water			
How can we check ?			
Take water and drift the gas which is coming out 			
We see that the gas easily dissolves in water and hence we			
say that the gas is soluble in water 			
 Soluble in water noise 			
Now this gas will neither support 			
cumbustion nor it will burn itself			
 Combustion 			
 Burn 			
So it is not a combustible substance nor it is supporting			
 combustion 			
 Combustion 			
Means the candle will go off 			
 Off 			
Now this gas can be easily liquidified			
On cooling you can liquidify 			
This make into or turn into liquid and it can be compressed			
Now have you understood the physical properties ?			
Yes			
Or no ?			
Yes 			
Now this we see the chemical properties of the gas			
Ammonia when combined with water you get ammonium hydroxide			
What do you get ?			
 Ammonium hydroxide 			
 Ammonium hydroxide 			
The formula for ammoniun hydroxide is Na four 			
 O H 			
 O H 			
N H four O H 			
 O H 			
What is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?			
N H four O H 			
Now this when a one or two words takes in 			
hydrochloric acid is taken here the jar we see that white fumes			
 of ammonium chloride are seen 			
Means what ?			
Ammonia react with hydrochloric gas to form 			
 ammonium chloride 			
 Hydrochloric gas 			
 Ammonium chloride 			
Now once again we repeat the physical 			
properties 			
 Properties 			
Can anyone tell all the physical properties ?			
Ammonia is a uh colourless gas 			
It is lighter than air			
It is it is highly soluble in water noise 			
Come on next property Bhushan ?			
Ammonia is colourless gas			
Uh it has uh sharp pungent uh irritating odour 			
It is lighter than air			
It is soluble in water 			
Uh it can be liquidified by cooling in low pressure 			
It is combustible in air and uh it is not 			
It is combustible in air ?			
It is			
It is not combustible in air			
Neither it supports 			
Combustion			
Sit down 			
Now the chemical first chemical property 			
Yes Priyadarshan ?			
Ammonia gas is basic 			
Okay and how will you can you say that ammonia gas is basic			
 ?			
It turns red litmus to blue 			
 Red litmus to blue 			
Okay next property ?			
Asha ?			
It reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide			
It reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide			
 Ammonium hydroxide 			
What is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?			
You Kapil ?			
N H three plus uh 			
No teacher 			
No ?			
N H four			
Four A 			
What is the formula for uh ammonium hydroxide ?			
N H four O H 			
Now the gas when kept with turmeric paper the turmeric			
paper turns			
Yellow			
Brown			
Brown 			
The yellow colour change to brown 			
 Change to brown noise 			
Now we see the next property 			
You take the mixture of ammonium chloride and make lines 			
and put it in a dry test tube 			
Now just insert a hot platinium wire into it			
Now the hot wire will supply heat to the mixture 			
Yes 			
And it reacts			
Platinium is acting as a catalyst			
Now what do you mean by the word catalyst ?			
 Wire 			
A substance which helps in chemical reaction 			
One at a time 			
The substance which helps in increasing the rate of			
reaction but does not take part in the chemical reaction 			
 Increasing the rate of reaction but does not take part			
in the chemical reaction 			
So what happens this gas oxidised to colourless			
nitric oxide gas 			
Ammonia gas oxidised to colourless nitric oxide gas 			
The nitric oxide further combines with oxygen 			
oxygen and from air and it becomes firm reddish brown 			
coloured nitrogen dioxide 			
 Oxygen 			
 Brown coloured nitrogen dioxide 			
This nitrogen dioxide fumes are seen in the test			
tube 			
 Test tube 			
So yes what happens when clay lime and ammonium chloride 			
 mixed in a taken in a dry test tube ?			
When a hard platinium wire is inserted when a hard			
platinum wire is inserted ammonia gets oxidised to form nitric oxide 			
This nitric oxide further takes oxygen from air and you			
get brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide 			
 Dioxide 			
Here platinium wire is acting as a catalyst 			
 Catalyst 			
So can anyone repeat the point 			
Yes Uma ?			
Hot platinium wire is inserted in the mixture of 			
ammonium chloride and clay lime			
Then hot uh then ammonia gas is oxidised into nitric 			
ox nitric oxide			
Nitric oxide takes oxygen from the air and that and			
red brown fumes of nitrogen oxide we get 			
Okay 			
Now you please sit down 			
Now we see the third property that BB-Work cold			
concentrated hydrochloric acid is taken in a test tube and the			
ammonia gas is passed over it 			
It combines uh reacts with the acid and forms crystals of			
 ammonium chloride 			
 Chloride 			
It forms crystals of ammonium chloride 			
 Ammonium chloride 			
So N H three plus H Cl gives you N			
H four Cl 			
 N H four Cl 			
Have you understood ?			
Yes 			
Means it readily combines with H Cl forming crystals of			
 ammonium chloride 			
 Ammonium chloride 			
Can anyone repeat the properties ?			
Ammonium uh uh reacts with			
Ammonia reacts with ?			
Ammonium uh uh 			
Ammonium reacts with the oxygen two times only this much			
Ammonium reacts with the H Cl forming crystals of ammonium			
chloride 			
And tell the equation N H three 			
 N H three plus H Cl gives you N H			
 four Cl			
Sit down noise 			
Now we see that this ammonia reacts with cold			
concentrated sulphuric acid and nitric acid 			
So take sulphuric acid in one test tube and nitric acid in			
 another test tube 			
 Another test tube 			
Pass ammonia gas through this test tube 			
We see that it reacts with sulphuric acid giving you ammonium			
sulphate crystals of ammonium sulphate and it reacts with nitric			
acid giving you ammonium nitrate nitrate 			
 Nitrate 			
So which should which can you tell me the 			
 summarize of the property that it gives salt it			
forms salt with when it reacts with its acid the respective salts			
are formed			
Have you understood ?			
Yes 			
Now see this chlo hydrochloric acid it is forming			
 chloride ammonium chloride			
With sulphuric acid it is forming sulphate ammonium 			
sulphate 			
 Sulphate 			
With nitric acid it is forming 			
ammonium nitrate 			
 Nitric 			
 Ammonium nitrate 			
Can anyone repeat these three properties noise 			
Yes Samir ?			
The the ammonium reacts with hydrochloric acid to			
form and to form ammonium chloride and it reacts with 			
sulphuric acid to form ammonium sulphate and it re reacts with 			
uh nit nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate 			
So any difficulty to you ?			
No 			
Or you have not understood ?			
Yes we have understood 			
So then we see the next property 			
When ammonia gas is slowly passed through copper sulphate			
solution what happens ?			
A bluish white precipitate is formed 			
A bluish white precipitate of copper hydroxide is formed			
And when more ammonia gas is passed this precipitate			
dissolves in the excess of ammonia and a solution of deep colour 			
blue colour is formed 			
Precipitate means 			
What do you mean by precipitate ?			
The residue which is remaining at the bottom 			
The residue or the substance which remains at the 			
bottom 			
 Bottom 			
Now see here when ammonia is passed through copper			
sulphate you get a bluish white precipitate 			
But when more ammonia is added this precipitate dissolves with			
 and you get uh da deep blue colour solution 			
Have you understood ?			
Yes 			
So when you pass more ammonia the precipitate divo			
 dissolves and you get deep blue colour solution 			
Can anyone summarize the properties ?			
Summarize means tell in short 			
All the properties or one property uh one student 			
The che the chemical properties of ammonia are			
 ammonia gas is basic which reacts with water and form ammonium			
hydroxide 			
It burns in atmosphere oxygen with yellow flame 			
It combines with hydrogen chloride to form ammonium chloride 			
It combines with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to form			
nitric oxide 			
It gives phosphate acid 			
Ammonia reacts with the solution of salts of nitric to form			
precipitate of that oxide 			
So have you understood the chemical properties of ammonia ?			
Uh yes 			
Now we see the uses of ammonia 			
Now first it is used in manufacturing			
Manufaturing means making of washing soda and 			
sodium bi-carbonate 			
 Sodium bi-carbonate 			
And also in nitric acid 			
 Acid 			
Now last year we had seen how ammonia is used in preparing			
nitric acid when we were studying acid 			
Now washing soda and sodium bicarbonate are different 			
The formula for washing soda is sodium carbonate Na two			
C O three 			
 Three 			
And for sodium bicarbonate it is Na H C O 			
three 			
 Na H C O three 			
Now this sodium bicarbonate is used in preparing food or			
 making the substance porous 			
While washing soda is used in ma washing clothes 			
Big clothes or blankets			
This washing soda is used 			
 Used 			
Now it is used in uh manufacturing of fertilisers like			
ammonium phosphate ammonium sulphate and urea 			
Now these fertilisers help in increasing the food crop of			
 uh by adding fertiliser what happens the quality and the quantity of the			
food crop or the grains increases 			
So these are used ammonium is used in as a fertiliser so			
that we can get more yield of crop noise 			
Now ammonia is also used in medicine 			
Now solution of ammonia is used in laboratory as a reagent			
Now what do you mean by the word reagent ?			
What do you mean by the word reagent ?			
Fooding agent which 			
A substance which helps in chemical reaction 			
A substance which is helping in chemical reaction			
 is called as a reagent 			
 Chemical reaction 			
 Reagent 			
Now this liquid ammonia is also used as solvent			
We have seen what do you mean by solvent is in which the			
substance gets dissolved 			
 Dissolved 			
So that solution in which the substance is getting			
dissolved is called as a solvent 			
 Solvent 			
Now ammonia is also used as a solvent 			
Some substance get dissolved in ammonia 			
Now any difficulty in chemical properties and uses of ammonia ?			
No noise 			
Now just answer the questions orally noise 			
Describe the laboratory of ?			
What are the chemicals used in preparing ammonia by			
laboratory method ?			
Yes ?			
Uh in laboratry methods uh ammonia ammonium chloride			
and clay lime is used 			
Ammonium chloride and clay lime is used 			
 Clay lime is used 			
What is the ratio of the mixture ?			
The ratio of uh the mixture is three is to two 			
Three is to two 			
What is done to the mixture ?			
The mixture is heated 			
The mixture is heated 			
 Heated 			
What comes out of the tube ?			
The ammonia gas comes out 			
Through which it is passed ?			
Yes ?			
It is passed through delivery tube 			
To the line tower through the line tower			
It is passed through the line tower 			
 Line tower 			
Why is it passed through the line tower ?			
Yes Ranjeet ?			
To dry 			
To dry the gas 			
 Dry the gas 			
How is the gas collected ?			
Yes ?			
By the downward uh downward displacement of jar 			
So any difficulty in this			
No 			
The development of painting in India interruption 			
on page number three hundred ninety-two 			
As far as paintings are concerned here comes the role of frescos			
Today the colours are much faded 			
But it is of its own kind 			
Another type of frescos we find at Barhat in Bihar 			
And luckily Ajanta paintings are in Maharashtra 			
The line used by the Ajanta artist is unique unparalleled 			
Though I have mentioned the example of Barhat in Bihar but			
 Ajanta frescos are are of its own type of its own class 			
Depicting various stories in the life of Buddha 			
In northern India the frescos at Bhag also 			
The Mughals brought with them the traditions of Persian painting			
Can we call it Indo-Islamic school of painting or art ?			
Anyone of you ?			
Can we call it Indo-Islamic school of painting in art ?			
It can be called as it can be called Indo-Islamic			
It can certainly be called because of fusion 			
 Aini Akbari mentions a number			
of artists Abdul Samad Mir Sayyed Ali Miskin Dasvant 			
Dasvan Mukand 			
So some of the famous names of the painters of the then times 			
have been mentioned here 			
Now page number three hundred ninety-four 			
 Sir ninety-four 			
Jahangir was a great patron of painting 			
Patron means supporter helper 			
One who helps us like a father is a patron 			
One who helps us like mother is matron 			
And original words they are from Sanskrit coming to Latin 			
and then in modern Indian languages like English 			
So original word is Pitro and Matro			
 			
Jahangir was a great patron of painting 			
Was Akbar also a great patron of hist uh painting ?			
Or only of painting ?			
Wilson Smith has mentioned in his book on Akbar that Akbar was			
a patron of all fine arts 			
And I will include literature also in it 			
So foundational work of the development in painting was			
already done during the period of Akbar 			
From second battle of Panipat fifteen fifty-six 			
Closing year of Akbar's life sixteen hundred and five			
So foundational work was done 			
But his son who took the name Jahangir came to the			
throne in sixteen hundred and five and died in sixteen twenty-seven 			
So during this period of twenty-two years Indian fine art			
 specially painting got tremendous stimulation and			
boost 			
So painting in India both of miniature type and mural			
type have been developed during the period of Jahangir's			
 special 			
But only to be a patron not knowing anything about the art			
Is it possible ?			
Anyone of you ?			
No sir no sir 			
Why not ?			
Now raise your hands 			
Yes 			
Without knowledge how can we draw our various things and			
ideas can not possible			
Correct 			
So a man who knows the work can only get the work done 			
from others 			
 That's why rigorous training is imparted in			
India to the cadet who become officers in future 			
So he must had have a fair idea about			
any type of work 			
Then only he can get it done from others 			
That is he can command perfectly 			
Hotel de matol must be a good cook himself otherwise			
holding that post in five- star Hotel at Bombay or any other international			
centre is not a joke 			
So not only we see but quite profeciency in any branch of work			
 or discipline is a must 			
Specially painting and various schools of art in painting			
developed during the period of Jahangir mainly for a reason that he was			
master of the art himself that he has mentioned 			
Then Nadir Murad Bhishandas Manohar Govardhan 			
Mansoor and Faruk Baig they all got help from emperor			
himself 			
Darashiko was a patron of painting 			
Who was this Darashiko ?			
Eldest son of Shajahan 			
Youngest son of 			
Eldest son of Shajahan was Darashiko 			
What is the speciality about Darashiko ?			
Can you mention one point in one sentence 			
First stand and then give the answer 			
 He was a the greatest 			
Yes ?			
Sit down			
Yes ?			
He practised what he preached 			
 Haan 			
You please explain that 			
Means uh he never ignore for interested in art so			
that he get man and what he told he would himself 			
Yeah 			
I would give the answer to this question myself like this 			
He was a liberal minded man 			
He was a follower of Sufism 			
He was tolerant to all religions and therefore he was a patron			
of all schools of arts 			
All types of religions wherever he found some sort of spark 			
he was always ready to run there as a patron to help it 			
So all types of artist got encouragement from him			
It was not that only the Muslims got it Hindus were in			
majority 			
Perhaps this might not have been liked by Aurangzeb and may			
be because of that Darashiko was disposed off 			
Even put to death 			
And the rule which Aurangzeb afterwards introduced was full of			
fanaticism too full of debauchery 			
That may be the reason Darashiko is a great personality 			
He got many and various books of Sanskrit translated into			
Persian 			
Such type of liberal man 			
Can he encourage arts in India ?			
Raise your hands and answer because my next question			
will be please explain 			
Yes ?			
He was learned scholar and free views on others means 			
Yes but 			
Such type of man who is a you can say a saintly type of man 			
Can he encourage the arts ?			
Perhaps 			
No not so 			
Sit down			
Yes ?			
As he was in interested in painting therefore he			
 used to encourage 			
 Accha was he encourage uh uh was he			
interested only in painting			
No he was interested in literature			
He translated many book of that Indo-Persian books and he			
used to read them 			
Yeah 			
So literature painting 			
Was he intersted in architecture ?			
No 			
Anyone raise the hands 			
No 			
Jahangir was specially interested in painting exclusively			
And therefore this book which is the publication of N C E R T			
has specially mentioned the name of Jahangir here though 			
Darashiko in with his limitation has previously tried to			
encourage various arts 			
The most important schools of painting emerged where the 			
Rajasthani and Pahari Schools 			
 Pahari 			
What is this Pahari School ?			
If anybody knows 			
Sir it is One word Pahari School			
Anyone else ?			
You ?			
It is from pahad 			
 Haan pahari work comes from 			
pahad 			
 It's pahadi so pahadi da			
 is many times pronounced as ra 			
So in mountainous region in the Himalayas various			
schools of art developed 			
In painting also 			
So all of them put together are known as pahari			
 paintings 			
What is this Rajasthani painting ?			
Sir desert desert 			
Yes ?			
Developing in Rajasthan			
Developing in Rajasthan 			
It has got nothing to do with desert because mainly the			
paintings in Rajasthan are about life of Shri Krishna 			
And the period of the early life and afterwards desert period			
 was around Mathura and then in Gujarat because the new city			
which he established can you tell the name of that city which was			
established by Shri Krishna ?			
Dwarka			
Dwarka which has now seen the bottom of the 			
ocean 			
 Ocean 			
Please sit down 			
It has been unearthed by one word noise			
 Haan under the supervision of him it			
has been located now 			
So it is a very good proof about all descriptions which			
you find about that city in Mahabharat 			
Sit down 			
Then languages and literature 			
Two main groups of languages the Indo-European or Indo-Aryan			
and Dravidian 			
Why he has said Indo-European and Indo-Aryan ?			
Because Aryans came from Aryavarta 			
No I would like to suggest you one method 			
Yes Soman ?			
Because Aryans came from the north uh northern			
track of Asia and they have got their own language 			
Yes ?			
The Aryans came from the region of Caspian Sea 			
Yes 			
Around the Caspian Sea from Central Asia 			
Some of the tribes went to Europe some of them 			
reached in India 			
But they are included in the Indo-European group 			
So Indo-Europeans or Indo-Aryans 			
Why this uh word Indo comes there ?			
Sir they came to India 			
 India 			
River Indus 			
Means that tribes of the Aryans who came to India 			
can they be called Indo-Europeans ?			
If they centralised form of culture of India			
If they can be called as Indo-Europeans then what is the			
 need for the use of word Indo uh uh Indo-Aryans ?			
You think and answer 			
Not just your guess 			
Because they are the Aryans now settled in India			
Then only you call them Indo-Aryans 			
Then nothing about Indo-Europeans at all 			
Because they come neither from Europe nor from India 			
They come from Central Asia 			
So Indo-European what do you understand by the word			
Indo-Europeans ?			
Europeans coming in India			
Europeans settled in India 			
Europeans settled in India			
Never 			
There is no record because Indo- European is a false language			
 Indo-Aryans is correct 			
And Aryans who settled in Europe 			
What word he has used for that ?			
Indo-Aryans 			
Aryans who settled in Europe ?			
 Indo- Europeans 			
 Europe 			
It looks simple but it is not simple 			
So now finally last question 			
To what branch do we belong today ?			
Indo-Aryans 			
Dravidians 			
Dravidians 			
Anyone else ?			
Indo-Aryans			
Indo-Aryans 			
If we are Indo-Aryans and one boy said Dravidian then what			
is the difference between Indo- Aryans and Dravidians ?			
Now burden will fall on your shoulders 			
Dravidians were in India 			
Yes ?			
They were 			
They were original inhabitants of India 			
They were original inhabitants of India before coming of			
whom ?			
Aryans 			
Before coming of Indo-Europeans or Aryans			
 Aryans 			
Or Indo-Aryans 			
Where do they live even today ?			
Southern part of India			
What is this method ?			
Means what part of India ?			
Southern part of India			
Southern part of India only 			
Then those who have settled in forest because of the onslaught			
of the Aryans original inhabitants of India as you have just now said 			
who were defeated by the Aryans 			
History records that they ran away into the deep jungles and			
forests 			
What are you going to call them 			
You say you uh Dravidians are settled only in South India			
 That's why this question I am putting up ?			
Before coming of the Aryans all the people they who were living in			
India according to your definition are original inhabitants of India 			
Did all of them run to South ?			
Nobody ran to the East North or West ?			
Ran			
Ran 			
Then what are they ?			
What are you going to call them ?			
Are they there today or not ?			
Yes sir 			
Then what is their names ?			
Tribes			
Schedule tribe			
Tribes 			
Whom we have scheduled in the constitution			
So we call them scheduled tribes 			
Now my final question 			
Those Dravidians who you say that are in South India can you			
call them scheduled tribes ?			
No			
No sir 			
Why not ?			
Just now you gave the definition I am only clearing your ideas			
Yes ?			
These are minorities that is they referred they have			
been a few words 			
Then ?			
From there Orissa 			
Imparts yes ?			
There have been means uh Indo-Aryans sir Indo-Aryans then			
 some of these split into 			
Dravidians 			
Then what is the use of calling them Dravidians 			
They are not called as Dravidians 			
You see the reason is like this Aryans came 			
conquered India defeated the original inhabitants			
But all this drama was played in North India 			
Or such a long period Aryans just could not come to the south 			
for two reasons 			
First thing north India is not a small place 			
It is very big area 			
Thus they would be going by slope only 			
If they come across the mountains naturally they are going to			
avoid that side or direction 			
So their journey was Eastwards till the conquest of 			
modern Bengal Assam Arunachal Pradesh			
That is upto uh uh Jaintia Patkoi hills 			
and Patkoi hills			
 Patkoi hills 			
Sir hills			
Garo Khasi			
Patkoi Patkoi			
Then they would turn to the South 			
So it took a very long time for them to defeat the people who			
were already settled in South and who had developing 			
developed their special culture and they had developed their			
languages with the different scripts			
This is important 			
Cultural heritage is mainly this 			
So Kannada Andhra and was Telugu Malyalam and			
Tamil is basic languages of the original inhabitants of the country			
 or of Dravidian nature 			
But they were not misplaced 			
They were not disorganised they continued to prosper and			
develop their own way of life which is known as culture 			
So Dravidian culture is mainly in south India in that sense 			
Sanskrit was a language of the Indo- Aryans 			
Does it mean Sanskrit was not the language of the Dravidian group			
 ?			
Yes sir			
But it might 			
Pointed question you think and answer 			
Last boy ?			
No 			
No 			
No 			
 One or two words 			
Dravidians people may have learnt that language from the Aryans			
From the Aryans only ?			
Because Yes sir 			
 Unless 			
Ah unless the Aryans penetrate into the south they can			
not understand nor they can come in the contact of uh Indo-Aryans			
 language that is Sanskrit 			
Can there be a language without grammar ?			
No 			
No then what is first grammar or language ?			
Grammar			
Language 			
Follow one method 			
What will take first ?			
What will come into being first Grammar or the language ?			
The language and 			
First language 			
First language only will come 			
The child who imitates the parents and tries to speak doesn't know			
anything about grammar 			
But once that pattern is set then someone had to bring it into			
rules 			
Then once the rules are framed all the things or writings 			
or your way of speak is not according to those rules			
Then we say this is not correct grammar 			
But is it a language ?			
Yes it is			
It is a language 			
So Sanskrit language Aryans brought with them only from			
Central Asia 			
But the period is early the people were in the form of tribes			
War type of warriors better conquerers 			
But once they settled on the permanent footing in the 			
Sapta Sindhu areas that is Punjab then someone must give			
some rules also 			
To consolidate it to classify it to make it classical one			
 Panini did that work 			
We had already learnt about the space flight			
of Yuri Gagarin the pioneer in the field of uh space flight 			
We have come upto the launching of the spacecraft 			
Further we studied will study on page			
fifty-seven 			
Page number page number sir page number			
Sir page number 			
Fifty-six			
At			
Fifty-seven 			
Fifty-seven 			
How many days after the launching the first and the second			
stages of rockets had bend down and fallen away the spacecraft			
projectory altered as I turned to go into orbit parallel with the earth			
 surface 			
Gagarin pulled himself towards the window I can see			
the earth in a haze 			
 I'm feeling fine 			
A moment later he added It looks uh beautiful			
 			
He was rather uh startled and exasperated when he looked			
through the window to the earth down below 			
He says I can see in a haze or it was not very			
clear			
The vision was not very clear			
It was murky or rather uh foggy or misty 			
Therefore he says in spite of the fact that I can see the			
earth in a haze			
It looks so beautiful 			
He loosened the scarf holding him to his couch 			
His body weightless in space rose slightly above the seat 			
though still held uh loosened scarf 			
He was in fact floating in his cabin 			
When he loosened his belt he was floating in the cabin 			
as you are aware of he experiences the weightlessness there in the outer			
space			
Therefore he was floating 			
Every three or four minutes he repeated his instrument reading			
through the radio telephone and received confirmation from ground			
control 			
Straight in front of him in his cabin was an instrument			
panelled with the globe navigator 			
A remarkable device which represented the earth below him 			
The globe slowly resolved as his position altered in			
relation to the earth 			
Quite often he had to come into contact with the earth station			
 or it is otherwise known as the earth controlling station 			
There was the panel of instruments displayed in his cabin 			
He had to observe the readings and the functions of this cabin			
 and it has to be conveyed through the telephone to the uh ground			
station 			
And they will confirm and accordingly they give instructions 			
what is to be done uh how it should be done so that he is always in			
contact with the uh earth station though he is all alone in the			
 Vostok 			
In the cabin away from uh the earth hundreds of miles			
 travelling at the tremendous speed of uh about eighty thousand uh			
 miles per hour 			
Still he is in contact with the earth station and 			
it is the two way system 			
He will inform them and they will accordingly uh instruct			
him what is to be done and what not to be done 			
But the minutes after the launching he was over South Africa			
 South America 			
 All is well he reported I am not			
too much troubled by the feeling of weightlessness 			
The report was given to the world by way of Moscow radio 			
Forty-six forty-five minutes after launching he was just above			
the South America and he conveyed uh to the earth station though			
he experiences weightlessness fear of gravity 			
 It does not cause any harm to him and this			
report was rather broadcast by the Moscow radio to all the 			
peoples in Russia 			
A little later the Atlantic was below him just visible only			
surface and of course quite invisible was the Russian tracking ship			
 using radar equipment to keep contact with the invisible spaceship			
A little later he was above the Atlantic Ocean 			
So he could see the sea or ocean clearly 			
He could not see the tracking ship 			
A ship was uh equipped with radar sophisticated uh 			
instruments to track the uh course of uh Gagarin's flight			
He could see the ocean clearly 			
Despite he couldn't see the ship which is uh detailed			
for tracking his uh flight 			
After just over an hour the space flight he was passing the coast			
of Africa a red light in the instrument panel gleamed 			
This was a warning that the descent would begin in ten minutes 			
He checked the instruments again and then reported that all was			
well 			
While he was above Africa a red light was gleaming 			
shining			
This was an indication his return journey should start within a			
short while 			
 Do you want to make an alteration in the flight plan			
 ?			
He was asked from the earth station the ground control he			
was asked whether he would like to change any uh change in the 			
schedule of his or plan of his flight whether he wants to remain in the			
space for a uh extended period ?			
 Cough 			
He replied that he was not to be brought down as planned			
Sorry 			
He replied that he wanted to be brought down as planned although he			
would how nice to go round the world again 			
And although the cabin was stored with ten days supply of food in			
case of any landing difficulty Gagarin thought it best to keep to the 			
prepared flight scheme 			
He informed the ground control though he would like to			
continue the flight for an extended period he wants uh everything			
should be done according to the plan or the schedule 			
Therefore he said that he is ready for everything is			
ready			
He checked for the return journey 			
At just the right moment retro-rockets were automatically fired			
 to slow off the spaceship at the same time the cabin was turned to			
exactly the right angle for the entry of the earth atmosphere 			
This operations were dealt with the with by			
a computer on the ground although in case the need Gagarin could have			
used manual control 			
Automatically the retro-rocket that means to slow down the speed			
 and tearing off the uh spacecraft because when it enters			
the atmosphere there is rather there is the line imaginary			
line the outer space and the atmosphere 			
There was a lot of rather you see that what you call that uh			
 heat generated when the space spacecraft re-enter our uh			
atmosphere			
That is why they used to make the spacecraft with a particular			
 uh metal which can resist or withstand the astronomical amount of			
heat produced			
Even then uh spa cosmonauts astronauts are also uh			
made to wear a number of space suits to avoid any harm when it re-			
enters the uh our atmosphere 			
So it was ready retroket rocket that means for receiving			
coming back automatically it was fired			
Everything was done by computer 			
Though there was the alternative provision for Gagarin to			
operate these things manually			
If something goes wrong he has to come back to the earth			
Therefore they always keep the contigency plan or alternative			
arrangement 			
If everything goes smoothly the computer will operate 			
If the firing of the rocket from time to time the			
tearing off the spacecraft everything will be monitored and controlled by			
the earth controlled station 			
After this exactness was record			
A very slight error might mean a lightening at a point of many			
miles from that intended 			
A slightly greater error could result in a descent with a space			
cabin at the wrong angle and it's destruction by the heat			
resulting from the air friction 			
It had to be done very meticulously 			
Very uh rather you see that uh uh exactly in the sense			
very with clinical precision precisely everything has to be done 			
A minor negligible error can cause uh a tremendous uh rather			
you see that a damage which may cause the destruction of uh 			
spacecraft and uh cosmonaut Gager Gagarin himself 			
So everything has to be very precise 			
Gagarin felt the jolt of the breaking rockets gave the			
shattereing rock but the change was not violent as he has expected 			
He felt the sensation of weightlessness gradually leaving him			
As he started his returning journey the air brake was applied			
he could feel the jolt			
Suddenly he was rather you see that uh jolted or moved 			
And then he was feeling the rather you see that the 			
gravitation of the earth as he was nearing to the earth the			
weightlessness was rather vanishing or on the decrease 			
The pressure became stronger and stronger as the Vostok			
 descended 			
His face visible on the television screen became drawn and tight			
almost in the flatness 			
The nose forced in the eye sockets widened 			
He could barely see 			
Speech was beyond him though his hearing remained 			
The voice of the ground controller was saying that all was well			
When that spacecraft the Vostok re-entered the			
atmosphere for a few moments it was unbearable for him 			
His face was flattened his eye sockets were bulging and 			
he could not even speak 			
Only he could hear and he could hear the ground station was			
telling everything was going on smoothly after the schedule 			
don't worry 			
Otherwise he was experiencing there for a uh few moments 			
quite uncomforatable because his face was swollen or flattened eyes			
were bulging 			
He could not talk 			
Restlessness he felt drowsiness he felt except he could 			
uh hear 			
The agonizing G-pressure lasted only a minute or two 			
Then it was lifted			
His weight became more normal 			
This unbearable and agonizing the painful the most			
painful experience lasted for two minutes 			
Then he was alright 			
Above target and on coast parachute raised coming on it			
was control system 			
Then again it was conveyed everything was in perfect			
trim perfect condition 			
 Extended noise 			
The voice prepared him for the physical shock as the parachute			
opened above the capsule 			
The slowing down of the Vostok was so abrupt			
that it was like a blow in the church 			
The spacecraft also is fitted with a parachute 			
We can imagine when it travels at a tremendous speed of eighteen			
 thousand miles if if it comes back to the earth at the same speed 			
it will come and dash to the earth to the destruction of uh 			
spacecraft and occupant 			
Therefore it has to be the speed had to be curtailed or contained			
The there was the parachute it was opened 			
From the window he could now recognise features of the land			
below him 			
It was an old training base in contrast with the rest of his			
journey 			
The descent was quite slow 			
But the ground in fact was coming closer and closer to the 			
consider considerable speed 			
As he was coming down and down descending flight returning			
flight he could see the land 			
It was an old discarded uh uh training station there he was			
going to land 			
The final stages of the descent were first seen by two			
women working in the fields of the widely spread parachute descended			
 with the mysterious cabin suspended below it 			
The woman's first thought was that they were witnessing			
the arrival of a spy 			
It was not very long since an American airman reconnoitre high			
over Russian territory had been brought down 			
The resulting neutral spy trend in Russia had got great sensation			
 throughout the world 			
When he was descending two women happened to see 			
They were rather frightened because at that time the 			
sensational uh bringing down of the U-two plane 			
U-two plane is a it was a spy plane of America 			
It is took it took off from Pakistan 			
Uh it it could not be rather you see that traceable unless a			
country has got a sophisticated instruments 			
If it flies over India we may not be able to know whether it			
is flight of course now we are in a position			
In those days you can imagine in sixties only uh Russia			
or some advanced country could detect the uh reconnoitre means spying			
flight of this planes			
It is called U-two plane 			
It took off from Pakistan because it is a close ally of United			
States			
Even today it is the close ally 			
So they allowed the planes the spy plane to take up			
reconnoitre plane or otherwise it is called espionage spying is			
called BB-Work 			
This plane was on a mission to espionage or spying 			
Russians uh could uh detect the presence of this plane			
They brought down uh with a missile 			
And the pilot was captured			
His uh name uh if I I'm not wrong uh			
Powell 			
An air-force officer a pilot called Powell 			
He was imprisoned 			
After many years with Americans and Russians negotiated and uh			
 he was released he was given his freedom 			
In those days this sensational news was spread all over Russia			
 about the bringing down of uh U-two spy plane 			
This woman the poor uneducated woman of the countryside 			
took this as an Ameriacn spy plane 			
They were rather frightened when this spacecraft was coming			
down with the parachute over it 			
They mistook it for a United States or American spy planes			
because the news was uh raging at that time about the bringing			
down of this U-two plane			
The spy the plane on its espionage or reconnoitre was brought			
down 			
The ground water 			
I was talking about the rain water which enters which falls on			
the surface of the earth is distributed in three ways			
Now can you tell me the three ways in which it is distributed 			
Yes Naresh ?			
Uh first it percolates uh means uh it			
percolates 			
 Where does it percolate ?			
Uh when it falls on the ground			
Yes ?			
What happens to it ?			
It gathers into ponds			
Correct 			
And it falls as rain			
Sit down 			
Which is the other one ?			
Miss it is evaporated 			
Okay			
It evaporates 			
Third one ?			
Which is the third way in which the rain water is			
It goes underground 			
Okay he said it goes underground			
On slopes the streams are formed 			
Correct 			
 Slopes down the slope the streams are formed 			
Good afternoon sir addressed to another teacher who came			
in 			
 Sit down sit down 			
Sit down 			
So which is the third way ?			
It flows down the slope to the river to form a			
river 			
So the three ways in which the rain water which falls			
on the surface of the earth is distributed 			
First thing it is eva some part of it evaporate 			
Second one it flows into small streams streams to join			
to form a river 			
And the third one is that it percolates inside into the 			
surface of the earth 			
Now the third one which the water percolates inside the			
earth forms what we'll call as what would you call it ?			
 To the river 			
Well 			
Okay well 			
But where are these wells ?			
 Where does where is the water in the			
well ?			
Ground			
Correct 			
That is underground water 			
So today we are going to study about the work how this			
 of underground water BB-Work 			
How this underground water is useful to man 			
Now underground water you know the water percolates inside the			
earth 			
But it is not the same throughout on every part of the			
surface 			
It is going to be different and it depends on various 			
factors 			
Now yesterday we were doing I told you about how water			
falls are formed 			
Okay ?			
And we were talking about the structure of the earth 			
Now suppose we take a mountain 			
This is the base noise 			
As I told you yesterday the waterfall has underneath it 			
you have permiable non-permiable 			
 Non-permiable 			
What do you mean by non-permiable structure ?			
In which the water doesn't percolate			
Correct 			
Because the surface is hard and because it's not			
porous the water cannot get inside 			
Now when the rain water is falling on the surface it gets			
as you told me goes inside 			
Now where is this water going to settle ?			
Yes ?			
It goes under ground			
Where do you mean ?			
What do you mean by ?			
At the base			
Correct 			
Somewhere here 			
Is it not ?			
Now this part is going to form what you call as the water			
table 			
Is it not ?			
This part where the water is settled down is called as a water			
table 			
 Now this now this amount of			
water in this water table would depend on various factors 			
Can you tell me what would it depend on ?			
 One or two words 			
Correct the amount of rainfall 			
Now wherever er those areas which have 			
high rainfall the water is going to be more in percolate more			
inside			
Anything else ?			
Nature of the soil inside the water table			
Correct the nature of the soil 			
Excellent answer 			
Where esle ?			
What all what are the other points ?			
Third one yes ?			
Inside the earth			
Loudly please 			
Inside the earth 			
Correct he said he said the same thing the nature of the			
soil 			
Structure or level of			
Level of the water table			
Okay sometimes 			
He is given a different answer but that is also			
Sometimes what happens that er uh mountain may			
have two water table			
You know two in the in a 			
non-permiable wa structures like in the cases I told you			
about a waterfall 			
Now here the waterfall is going to be above 			
There are going to be two different waterfalls water tables 			
This wat kind of water table is called as perched 			
water table 			
Is that understood ?			
Now which is the other point on which the water table			
the amount of water is going is going to depend on ?			
Level of the ground 			
Okay the level of the ground 			
What else ?			
Loudly			
please close the door 			
Size of the mountain			
Size of the mountain			
Anything else ?			
See the top of the mountain the tip is not a very big			
place not a very you know it's it's got it has 			
uh how would you define a mountain ?			
Yes Naresh ?			
The area of high altitude with steep slopes to the land			
Correct			
Now what is the second point you said was steep slope 			
Is it not ?			
Nahid 			
Now this area is going to continue 			
If the slope is steep what will happen ?			
Yes uh Mukesh ?			
The circulation will be easy			
The circulation would be easy of what ?			
Anybody else ?			
Sit down 			
Yes Kabra ?			
The water is sloped down 			
Okay and what would happen ?			
Continue with that now what ?			
The water is percolated			
Correct the the slopes some you know more steep			
you would have more water getting inside the water table 			
So these are the various aspects on which the waterfall			
 the water table depends 			
Something else ah			
Now let's go back to our very basic 			
How do rain fall ?			
On what do they depend on ?			
The amount of water evaporated			
Correct 			
Evaporation			
Correct			
Something else ?			
Good point when something else related to that yes Ballal ?			
There is there more water			
Okay			
What happens where where which are the regions where you would			
have more water ?			
You know more more rains to be more precise			
Yes ?			
The slope of the mountain			
Correct 			
Something else ?			
It is actually two words which is uh			
Okay 			
And then			
 You're coming somewhere near 			
Miss uh the water get deposit 			
Okay now next 			
All the points you hilly regions hilly region			
 okay hilly regions			
 Hilly regions hilly region 			
Yes ?			
From the sea 			
Sea okay			
 You're getting you know			
Trees			
Correct 			
Excellent			
Where there is more vegetation because of the leaves attract			
the water as a more scientific reason 			
You would have what is called as more rainfall there			
because of the trees			
So vegetation is the point noise 			
The other is evaporation 			
Yes ?			
 One or two words 			
Okay afterwards 			
Now these are the various fa factors on which the water			
table is formed			
Now what does this water table why is it used ?			
How is it used ?			
How does man use this water table ?			
Can you think ?			
How does the man how does man use this water table ?			
By taking water from the well			
Correct in the form of well			
Yes ?			
By digging canals 			
Its inside 			
Yes ?			
Wells			
Okay wells of different type 			
Now we see now we have seen in various movies and we have			
heard in various documentory we have heard in we've read in			
newspapers and we just know through our general knowledge that uh 			
we cannot you know dig a well any way which you like 			
Now can you tell me why is it so ?			
Underground			
Underground ?			
Springs are there			
Okay			
He says underground springs exist			
We will talk about what is a spring afterwards			
Some places are uh weak 			
Okay very weak but something else you know			
Water is not getting in			
Correct yes or they may be to be more precise 			
anything			
The area is non-permiable			
Yes non-permiable			
Yet some wherever vary where those regions then you			
have water table and where it is easy for the man to dig you may have 			
 what wells 			
You know where the water table is high and exist possible for			
man to find dig for a well 			
Now in Maharashtra you have under Konkan coast Tapi Purna			
basin			
Other various areas where a lot of wells are found because of			
the water table is even in the Sahyadri 			
Now can you tell me why in the Sahyadri ?			
The reason is very obvious 			
In the hilly region because of excessive rainfall and it may			
have the structure of permiable and non-permiable rocks you may			
have well there 			
Somebody said that the wells are dug in areas where there are			
springs 			
Now how would you define a spring ?			
You know what a spring is ?			
Everybody likes to go to Lonavala for holidays rainy ti			
 season specially and you see a lot of springs and waterfalls			
also 			
Now how would you describe a spring ?			
Yes ?			
The water which uh slope underground falls from a head			
We did something like that way it is similar definition			
What was that ?			
A waterfall there is a difference between a waterfall and			
a spring 			
Ground water is one word the ground water			
You can see on uh tap also 			
Is it not ?			
How would you differentiate between a spring a tap and a waterfall			
 ?			
The underground water coming out with force			
Correct 			
Underground water comes out with force as she said 			
It is a natural outflow of water from the interior of the			
earth 			
Now where does this water come out from ?			
Can you just link up whatever we did till now and try to tell me			
the answer 			
Yes Bilwa ?			
The water table and			
Loudly Bilwa ?			
There are water table and the			
Okay			
 They were there are water table and the			
earth crust is weak 			
So there are the regions where you have waterfalls 			
Where you have something called a spring BB-Work 			
Now suppose here there is a crack or a weak structure 			
Now the water this is the whole the whole 			
 water table 			
The water is coming out 			
And you would have what you would term as a spring 			
So spring is the natural outflow of water some from the			
interior of the earth where the crust is weak 			
Now the springs are of different types 			
Springs			
Suppose there is a cavity you know there is she said the crust is			
weak			
Now suppose if there is a cavity here 			
You know what a cavity is ?			
What is a Cavity ?			
Empty space			
Yes ?			
Empty space			
Empty space 			
Okay a kind of a hole you see here			
Where is this term used mostly cavity ?			
Where have you heard this term ?			
Dental problem			
Dental problem 			
Cavity is with all the people 			
Everybody all of us like eating sweets and we develop what you			
call as a cavity			
Is it not ?			
So suppose similarly the now take imagine the			
structure of the earth the mountain or any place BB-Work 			
Like a mouth having a cavity			
Now when the rain water falls on the surface what is going to			
happen ?			
There it store water			
Correct all the water might get inside and get stored			
here 			
And suppose there is a crack due to erosion you would			
have a spring coming out 			
Now this spring it may be termed as uh cycle spring			
A cycle spring 			
Where there is a cavity in the earth in the you know in			
interiors you would have the water get stored and due to some crack			
or erosion of some kind the water comes out through some outlet to			
form a spring and that kind of spring is called as a cycle spring 			
Now from the spring we will go to something which I was telling			
you yesterday as a continuation that because of the structure of the			
earth and because of the various minerals found in the earth you have			
beautiful structures underground caves formed somewhere 			
Now I will show you suppose there is an area 			
You know earth consist of maleable minerals 			
Now suppose there is this surface of the earth which is			
 which's got a lot of lime in it			
Lime stone structure limestone			
How uh how how would you what is the you know how			
would you call that uh the scientific name for it ?			
The I don't know how to tell you that 			
Now H two O is carbon uh water you say			
How uh how would you call limes ?			
Calcium			
Give me in alphabets			
C A C O three			
Okay BB-Work somebody said C A C O three 			
If an area has got a lot of C A C O three as you say what			
would happen ?			
How does this dissolve ?			
This does not dissolve in water alone 			
You have some			
Yes ?			
Carbon di-oxide			
Correct 			
The carbon di-oxide which is in the air and which 			
you know join the uh is mixed with the rain water makes it to 			
weakens the limestone structure and make a lot of depressions erosion			
takes place 			
And this area where this surface of the earth where limestone			
structure is in dominant is a dominant rock structure we would call it as			
a limestone topa topography 			
Limestone topography 			
Or for you to know something more about BB-Work 			
It is also called as a cast topography 			
 Cast topography it is taken from the word cast			
It is a name of a district in Yugoslovia 			
It is got which is prominent rock structure is the limestone			
structure 			
That is why it is also called as termed as a cast 			
topography from its name of the district cast in Yugoslavia 			
Now as I told you erosion takes place with when C A C O three 			
mixed and the water which you have carbon di-oxide leads to dis 			
uh leads to limestone dissolving with water and having			
displaced small kind of depression 			
Now small this may be termed as a pot hole BB-Work			
 a bigger one may be termed as a as gorges to termed as 			
gorges 			
Now if this continuous say years together you have very			
beautiful structure forming then 			
Now this you know this the limestone dissolving this water 			
and sometimes what happen when the limestone dissolves with the water some			
part of the the lime remains behind 			
Others get you know it washes away with the water and a			
very small millimeter of lime is remained there 			
Is that understood ?			
Similar structure will take place at the base at the			
surface 			
A small structure may remain here or the other water which has			
lime is washed away 			
Now this goes on for years you know			
Millions of years small small limestones particles			
remaining behind and they have been given different term 			
Now this is called as stalagmite 			
Stalag mite the other is the stalactites t i t e			
s stalactites			
Now for you this is very confusing			
How or how you are going to remember which is stalactite and which			
is stalagmite stalagmite which is stalagmite ?			
I will tell you something to remember 			
Mite something to do with mice it rhymes with it 			
Due to some extent mice where is it found ?			
On the surface 			
So stalagmites are on the ground stalactites are on the			
 ce ceiling 			
Now you stand up ?			
Tell me what is this ?			
Bamboo 			
This ?			
Uh cotton 			
Sit down 			
How are these two things prepared ?			
By 			
With the help of what ?			
Bamboo 			
Bamboo isn't it ?			
And also with the help of the means of 			
means of production			
What is the means of production ?			
How they are prepared ?			
 Bamboos with the help of bamboos as			
already told			
But how ?			
With the help of what ?			
Teacher with machine machines 			
Teacher no teacher with the help of hand 			
 hands 			
 With the help of hand hands 			
 			
 With the help of hand hands 			
 			
And these ?			
Teacher 			
These these			
With the help of what ?			
Machines 			
So these things are prepared with the help of 			
machine machines and these with the help of hands			
 Hands 			
Now let us see to in today's 			
 lesson how these this machine age			
started ?			
Machine age started and then how this industrial revolution			
started ?			
 Noise 			
So let us take up now this industrial revolution BB- Work			
Industrial revolution> 			
First of all let us study the meaning of industrial revolution			
Meaning BB-Work 			
There are you see just say as you study 			
 the world history 			
Man has passed through several stages isn't it ?			
In its economic growth he has passed through several stages 			
First he was a wanderer moving from one place to			
another place 			
Then he started agricultural activities in then			
he started having so many other activities isn't it ?			
So that way why he he was engaging			
himself in one or the other kind of activities ?			
 Revolution 			
 In in order to progress			
In order to progress and in order to satisfy his needs 			
isn't it ?			
In the primitive stage he used to have only stones 			
Only stones were at his disposal isn't it ?			
So he was using the stones and preparing instruments out of			
it 			
You know how he made fire as you know by friction and everything			
you know			
And the other weapons also he made out of stones			
And then in the agricultural stage he started making use of			
wood			
Wooden plough and wooden instruments he started preparing 			
Understood no ?			
So why he prepared all those things ?			
In order to satisfy his needs 			
 Needs 			
That was his prime necessity			
Satisfying his needs was his prime necessity 			
 Needs 			
As the time passed his needs increased 			
There is a va vast difference			
between the needs of the man in the past and needs of the man in			
the present age 			
Our present man man's needs			
are vast unlimited			
But whereas in the past they had only limited needs 			
As he has thinking capacity you know that man is an			
 a thinking animal			
With the help of his thinking capa 			
capacity he started finding out new things in 			
 inventions and discoveries			
He started inventing new things and discovering new lands			
 and other things 			
So that way he progressed well 			
So in the eighteenth century in some parts of the world			
Let us uh refer to those parts later on			
Some parts of the world they started using this 			
 these machines 			
They started preparing machines 			
New inventions and they are specially machines they started			
 you know that 			
You may be having a little idea about that 			
What type of machines and all were produced 			
But if you just said the meaning of the industry here			
Industry means even prior to eighteenth century there were			
industries isn't it ?			
There were industries and they were producing so many things			
 One one example of the same kind this			
basket and this these steel cups 			
 I have now here			
 Cups 			
They used to prepare cups not of steel but of 			
bronze copper gold silver			
They used to prepare no 			
Even that can also be called as industry 			
Understood ?			
What I'm telling you are getting the point no ?			
Yes teacher			
But yet this industrial revolution which started in the			
eighteenth century was completly different from that of the previous idea of			
industry 			
 Industry the meaning literal meaning			
If you just referred to the dictionary it will show you that 			
industry is nothing but making useful goods out of raw materials 			
Whereas this industrial revolution is completely different 			
It increased the production 			
New inventions were made			
 It is the production was on a 			
large scale 			
Not only that it changed the pattern of the society 			
Way of life of the people was completely changed 			
Understood no ?			
 you have studied			
The meaning of the revolution you know			
Complete change in the way of life of the people 			
 So in this industrial revolution changed			
the life of the people completely			
Society itself was changed 			
Did you understand ?			
That is the meaning of here industrial revolution 			
Change in the means means 			
and in process of production 			
So now let this industrial revolution is uh not a			
sudden movement			
It didn't occur within a fortnight or within one			
 a month or within two months			
 It's gradual process 			
In the eighteenth century it started 			
In the eighteenth century it started and slowly 			
it spread all over the world 			
First it started in England then it spread to other parts			
Even now also industrial revolution is not complete 			
In India and China the industrial revolution started in			
nineteenth century 			
Whereas in African countries it has started just now 			
In some of the African countries it has started just now			
That means even now also the process of industrial revolution is			
going on			
It is not complete 			
Some countries like England America and all no ? they			
have achieved full progress Understood ? as far as industrial			
development is concerned 			
Now next topic 			
Factors favouring an industrial revolution 			
Some eight points are there			
Eight factors which generally favour an industrial revolution			
First one is growing demand for products BB-Work 			
Increasing trade and discovery of new markets 			
You know prior to industrial revolution 			
In the twentieth century only these two countries America			
 Russia is disintegrated now			
U S S R is disintegrated 			
But we will talk about we can talk about 			
 those Russia and uh America 			
 They they become poor			
I mean uh superpowers 			
But prior to that in sixteen seventy medieval period 			
Britain was superpower like 			
You can't call it super though but it is was 			
 the strongest politically stable country in the whole world 			
Britain 			
And it had control ov over 			
 several parts of the world			
It has had colonies no ? all			
over the world 			
Our India was also one of the colony of the Britishers 			
And they were successful in all these continent Asia			
Africa and European countries			
They acquired so many territories so many colonies were			
 under them			
They were powerful 			
So there the industrial revolution started first 			
As they were having colonies as well there was increasing			
demand for products 			
You know their colonial policy you know the			
Britishers colonial policy 			
They didn't allow any industries or any progress to occur in a			
colonial state 			
 That's why in the colonies there was increasing			
demand for products 			
Finished product and as much usable goods 			
Then increasing trade also			
As they had so many colonies they were having increase			
 increased trade also with the with those			
 colonies			
Then discovery of new markets 			
They were not happy with whatever they were having 			
 they were have going for more and more colonies 			
Who are going for more and more colonies ?			
England 			
 European country espece European			
countries especially Britain 			
 Britain 			
Then second factor that favoured the industrial revolution is			
 the need to change the productive process 			
Prior to industrial revolution they used to prepare the goods with			
the help of hands 			
You know ?			
In order to prepare the small one small 			
basket they need needed more than one hour no			
 ?			
Yes 			
But this type of sturdier ones cups 			
steel cups 			
 They can be they can prepare or 			
 we can manufacturing we can manufacture this type of			
cups more than thousands 			
They can produce with the help of machine isn't it ?			
So that way the wasting waste of time			
they were planning to have such a machine which produced more things			
within limited time 			
So that way what happened is need to change the productive			
process start 			
They wanted to change the product the means			
of production 			
Next the third is discoveries and inventions 			
These discoveries			
You know the difference between discoveries and inventions ?			
I think so 			
Can you tell me the what is the difference between the			
inventions and discoveries ?			
Inventions means uh inventing a completely new thing and			
discovery means to discover uh a land			
To find out the land which is already existing			
No			
Not known			
 Known 			
It is already existing but unknown to the rest of the world			
That is discovery			
Invention means ?			
It is no just like which what was not			
at all there there and it is found that is invented that			
we call as inventions 			
 There 			
 Inventions 			
Then next is sit down this discovery is you know			
In eighth standard you have studied about the geographical			
discovery			
So many lands were uh land routes and lands			
were found out by great sailors like Vasco de-Gama 			
Megallan and so many other sailors you have studied all this			
 De-Gama 			
And inventions for the invention is as far			
as inventions are concerned they found out new machines 			
That we are going to study in detail in the next chapter again 			
So that way discovery and inventions also should be there			
That also favours industrial revolution			
Next fourth factor is capital needed for producing machines			
See in order to have a factory or a an 			
industry you need a lot of money not in thousands in 			
crores in lakhs and in crores 			
we need isn't it ?			
So that poor country too for the poor			
country it was not possible to accumulate that much money 			
So only a few countries like England were accumulating			
capital on large scale			
So that was capital capital means money that is 			
also one of the important factor that favoured the industrial revolution 			
Next fifth one 			
An atmosphere conducive to the freedom of thought 			
If you are have one example I'll			
 give you			
If I just scold you and beat you and if I make you only whatever I			
am asking you you must learn I am whatever 			
I am dictating you that only you must write and only you			
that you think you have to study			
If I tell like that then I am curbing down your capacity			
to think			
You won't think then you will become only copycats 			
There is no work			
There is no opportunity for your uh uhm intelligence			
Understood no ?			
To show your intelligence there is no scope only 			
So whereas if free atmosphere is given then you will come with			
new ideas no ?			
So that will lead you in some of the countries that is			
specially England there where it started first			
Industrial revolution first statred first in England no ?			
They had free atmosphere that is democratic atmosphere they			
had 			
 This democratic atmos because of this			
atmosphere they could think freely and they could find out new			
things and they could invent new machines and all that 			
Sixth one is availability of coal and iron 			
In order to have industry we have two essential factors			
first one is iron then the second one 			
 coal 			
 Iron 			
 Coal 			
With the help of iron you can make so many things			
Machines and other articles you know and then			
steel can also be made with the with the help of			
iron 			
Then coal coal is also equally			
essential 			
For what ?			
Advani ?			
He is not attentive noise 			
I am asking you coal is also essential in industrial development			
How is it essential ?			
And how is it useful ?			
What is coal you know ?			
 Kolsa 			
Uhm what type of kolsa ?			
 Dagadi 			
 Dagadi kolsa it is called as you know in			
 Marathi 			
 Yes 			
Yes ?			
Yes use ?			
For producing thermal energy 			
For heating the iron iron 			
particles in			
 That is that is that means for			
generating N H thermal energy it is called as 			
So in order to run the machines power is essential no ?			
Power is essential so that power is can be			
 obtained by heating the coal			
Run with the help of the coal			
We can obtain the power to run the machines so that these two			
things were also available in England 			
 Let's have a skilled labour to handle a machine			
If you have visited any factories factory 			
 you have visited any factory or uh industry 			
They have so many divisions like like uh 			
 welding moulding dyeing they fitting this			
that			
So many you no ?			
So that way there will be so many departments like 			
To handle this each department they should be 			
have skilled labours who are having some technical know-how			
regarding that paticular department 			
That is essential 			
Otherwise it will be like sambar daba 			
In one daba only all things are kept no			
 that way only one person only handling all the things that 			
means there is no excellence			
You won't expect any excellence in that 			
So for each ever whichever one field			
only for example if you take welding and you will become perfect in that			
particular field 			
All right now we've been looking at Catford's theory			
of 			
That doesn't mean uh you should not write 			
Okay just because it's being recorded doesn't mean that you			
shouldn't take down notes 			
Of course you will have to 			
Uh let us first look at the way he uh we have seen at			
uh we have looked at his theory of language 			
This is basically a model of language description which is			
borrowed from Halliday 			
Uh which is known as a scale in category model of uh English 			
grammar 			
Now let's turn to his discussion of and classification of			
translation type			
Now Catford's theory of translation is essentially a			
product oriented theory 			
Why do we call it a product oriented theory ?			
Because his main attempt is to look at different kinds			
of translation and classify these translations into different			
categories 			
 He's not looking into the mind of a translator 			
He is looking at the object of translation 			
The object that the translator has produced 			
Which means that he is looking at the empirical product of			
translation 			
What has been actually produced 			
And he is not looking at what was going behind the			
translation in the mind of the translator 			
So this theory is often called a product orientated theory of			
translation because the approach here is empirical 			
It tries to analyse classify categorise translations 			
products of translations into different types 			
Now for Catford a theroy of translation is essentially concerned			
 with a certain type of relation between languages 			
And therefore he calls it a branch of Comparative Linguistics 			
Now in this he is very much his approach is very			
much like the approach of Halliday 			
Halliday also if you remember argues that translation is not an			
independent branch of dis or discipline 			
 			
Uh it is a branch of Comparative Linguistics 			
Where you compared languages so to establish the comparability			
between languages 			
How far they are structurally similar or dissimilar you use			
translation 			
Catford however goes on to define the translation process 			
further 			
He says translation is always unidirectional that is you can			
always translate at one time from one language to another and not			
vice versa 			
That is translation has a direction from English into Marathi or			
Marathi into English unidirection 			
One direction 			
At one time you can't translate from both English into Marathi as			
well as Marathi into English it will have to be a unidirectional process			
from one language to another 			
That language from which you translate is called a source			
language and the language into which you translate is called a target			
language 			
And translation is defined as the replacement of			
 write down the definition please the replacement of			
textual material in one language that is S L by eqivalent textual			
material in another language 			
Now obviously there are two key terms in this definition 			
One is textual material and another is 			
 eqivalent textual material 			
The term eqivalent 			
So essentially he is talking about a particular type of text and			
a particular type of eqivalence 			
These are the key operations key terms in translation 			
So before we go on to to discuss the term of the term 			
 eqivalent let us look at the types of translation 			
uh that he argues there exist 			
These categories of translations or types of translations are			
 proposed in terms of extent of translation level of translation			
and rank of translation 			
Level of translation extent of translation and rank of			
translation 			
Let us first look at the classification according to the			
extent of translation that he proposes 			
 There are in each of these there are two types of			
translations for in all there are six categories of translation that he			
proposes 			
So according to the extent to which you translate a text 			
How much of the text you are translating in a syntagmatic sense			
 in the linear sense			
Syntagmatic means linear 			
So are you taking the full text for translation or are you taking			
only half of the text for translation ?			
How much of of the text are you taking up			
for translation based upon this this is known			
as the extent of translation 			
Now he says if you take the entire text for translation it is			
known as full translation 			
If you take only half of the text it will be partial translation			
So full versus partial translation 			
Now this text may be anything alright			
It may be a single poem it may be a book of short stories			
 collection of short stories			
It may be essays a novel whatever 			
It can be only a sentence also 			
Text will depend upon how much you have taken as a unit which			
can be once again of course sub-divided into different units			
If you take the totality of the text in translation uh you			
translate the entire text it is full translation if you translate only part			
of it it is known as partial translation			
And this relates to the term extent of translation			
So he proposes three terms extent level and rank 			
And the first classification according to the extent is full versus			
partial translation 			
Now in partial translation once again obviously some parts of the			
text are left untranslated 			
This may happen for various reasons for example if you are			
translating the description of a marriage ceremony uh from Marathi into			
English 			
If there is a sentence sanaiche mangal sur 			
hote ghumat hote 			
How will you translate the term sanai 			
 			
You can't because there is no equivalent for 			
sanai 			
Now in that case probably we'll have to keep some of these			
terms just like that in the translation 			
You will have to say uh I don't know how you would translate			
this into English but you will have to keep the word sanai			
 if you might probably say shahnai 			
 okay			
To make it sound different from the Marahti item			
But you are not proposing any English eqivalent term for 			
shahanai or sanai 			
So there may be different reasons why you increase parts			
Sometimes there are no equivalent terms there are no equivalent			
concepts also 			
In that case case you will have to keep			
the term as it is uh in the uh translated text			
So there are different reasons for why you uh have to adopt			
the processes of partial translation 			
Now the other uh distinction that he proposes relates to the			
level of language in question 			
This classification according to the level of translation uh			
 is proposed as total translation versus restricted translation 			
Now total translation means translation made at all levels of the			
source language 			
When we looked at the theory of language that he was proposing he			
discussed 			
He said that he talks about different levels of organization of			
language for example there is a phonological level there is a			
morphological level there is a syntactic level 			
These are all different levels of language			
Now what level are you translating for example he gives			
later on an example of if you write Indian Airline 			
the word Indian word Indian Airline you can write that			
in English I N D I A N A I R L I N E S or you can also write write it			
in E and then a nukta on			
top D with kana matra ya and			
 na this is also possible			
You can use uh Devanagari script in other words			
So in restricted translation in total translation you are			
taking you are proposing translation equivalence at all levels of			
 the text morphological syntactic etcetera			
And graphalogical also 			
Now the problem is only uh you don't have equivalence between			
graphalogical level 			
You can't have equivalence between graphological level because these			
are two substances so there won't be any equivalence between these			
two			
But you can say that there is equivalence in sentence structure			
 noun phrases uh word okay or uh clauses main			
clause-main clause relative clause-relative clause this can happen			
So in total translation equivalence are proposed at all levels in			
restricted translation you have you have 			
replacement uh of only of few levels okay			
Uh once again the third is uh the rank of translation			
Now we use in traditional terminology we use free			
 translation uh as a term literal translation			
or free translation 			
Now Catford classification of translation type here 			
unbounded and bounded translation 			
 Bounded is rank bound translation and unbounded			
is translation which is not rank bound which shift up and down on the			
scale 			
Now let us look at what this means exactly 			
If is there is a sentence which has a noun phrase and a verb			
phrase 			
You translate noun phrases as noun phrases			
So article by article adjective by adjective a noun by noun 			
phrase by phrase clause by clause			
 This is that is the rank of there are different			
ranks we know 			
The rank of clause sentence phrase word and sound 			
Your translation may be tied to these ranks 			
As I said article by article noun by noun adjective by			
adjective adverb by adverb this is verb by verb			
This is possible when you translate like this it is known as			
rank bound translation 			
Sentence by sentence translation that is also rank bound			
translation			
Within that sentence you may have rank shifting 			
When we were discussing the scale of rank rank shifting			
 we discussed that phenomenon of rank shifting and we said that when a			
sentence a clause for example functions as part of N P we say that a 			
clause is actually in the higher category and the word or the phrase is			
actually in the lower category 			
But a clause can function as a part of the phrase 			
Right ?			
When we say the boy who was standing in the corner 			
Now who was standing in the corner is a clause			
which is part of a phrase noun phrase 			
Here we see rank shifting taking place 			
Where rank shifting takes place we say that it is unbounded			
translation 			
It is not rank bound 			
Sometimes in traditional terminology when we say that this			
translation is literal translation and this translation is uhm free			
translation			
These are the terms which we usaully proposed			
You might be asked a question on this uh the difference			
between traditional terminology of describing translation products and 			
terminology used by Catford 			
Now in traditional terminology we use the term free and literal 			
in both senses 			
Right in when we talk about literal translation			
 we may mean uh word by word translation 			
 literal translation			
Word by word or we may also mean sentence by sentence			
translation 			
The traditional classification is rather vague 			
Sentence by sentence also becomes literal word by word also			
becomes literal or meaning by meaning also becomes literal 			
If you translated a phrase such as Kakhet kalasa 			
and gavala valasa 			
If you translate this literally word by word it will give some			
very funny meaning I suppose in English 			
That will be literal translation where you are totally ignoring			
the meaning uh you are translating each word but that meaning is			
not going to be the meaning of that particular proverb there 			
There can be also example I gave you some examples from the			
Bible Je majakadun tijmadhye janmvile te 			
A case of rank bound translation case of rank bound			
translation case of literal translation 			
But remember rank bound is much more clear and definite clearly			
defined because you know that this is the rank of clause or sentence or			
phrase or word or sound for phoneme 			
Whereas in literal translation the term is rather vague because			
in literal translation it can be anything 			
It can be sentence uh by sentence translation word by word 			
meaning by meaning okay 			
But literal translation will always be rather awkward 			
Unless the two languages are absolutely identical which would			
very rarely be the case it would be a very awkward translation 			
Whereas unbounded translation see we are establishing 			
clarity between the terms that Catford proposes and the terms that have been			
proposed in traditional translation criticism 			
Catford proposes terms like unbounded and bounded			
 			
 Bounded is according to the traditional			
terminology literal translation 			
And we saw the difference between these two terms 			
In uh unbounded translation you			
can take liberties with the text that means that sometimes a whole			
sentence may be translated in a word			
It is possible to do that 			
Or one for one word you may use one sentence 			
Sometimes in unbounded translation Catford doesn't discuss this			
possibility but it is possible to even delete or add portions of			
the text add to the portions of the text or you can delete some parts of the			
text			
This is possible 			
See children I will be uh talking about weathering			
once again okay 			
 We'll be talking about weathering 			
Now just behave as if you've not learnt this chapter okay			
 I'll start with from the beginning 			
Now the atmospheric conditions condition 			
 is never constant 			
It keeps on changing okay			
There is always throughout you have rise and fall			
of the temperature okay			
Now as this rise and fall of the temperature affects 			
human being our skin for example you find that in the cold season 			
your skin get shrivelled 			
It get shrivelled it get cracked			
Your lips get cracked 			
So they are subject to that the changes in the 			
atmosphere okay			
The rise and fall in the temperature 			
Now similarly this atmospheric condition this rise and fall of the			
temperature also affect other components for example the rocks 			
Now like how the wear and tear of a skin similarly the			
rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear okay			
Due to the rise and fall of the temperature the rocks are also			
affected 			
Now how they are affected ?			
 We'll be doing we will I will be discussing			
that also shortly 			
Now this wear and te tear 			
 it's this uh atmospheric ke changes in the			
atmosphere a affect the rock and this			
rock get soften breaks up into pieces 			
So this is known as weathering 			
The softening and the breaking up of rocks is termed as			
 Tear 			
Weathering			
Okay			
The wear and tear			
Like how our skin for example get shrivelled gets cracked 			
or even in the hot summer season you find it very dry okay			
You find your skin getting very dry			
Similarly the rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear 			
And this that exist so the rocks been uh they 			
are exposed to the atmosphere always 			
They are always exposed to the atmosphere 			
This wear and tear of the rock the softening and the			
breaking up of rock is termed as			
Weathering			
Okay			
So could you repeat the definition weathering			
Yes Ranjeet ?			
There are uh there are the wear and tear of			
 of rocks by the atmosphere upon the rock is called			
weathering 			
Yes of cou upon uh			
So the softening and the breaking up of rock in geographical			
term is defined as weathering weathering			
 Weathering 			
Sit down take your seat okay			
Now this weathering can be classified into two types 			
okay			
Chemical weathering and mechanical weathering 			
 Mechanical weathering 			
Okay			
We classify this weathering into chemical and mechanical			
Okay now what is this mechanical weathering ?			
That is mechanical weathering is caused because of the			
rise that difference in temperature the variations in temperatures 			
cause mechanical weathering 			
So how does it take place ?			
What happens to the rock because of the variations in temperature			
 ?			
What happens ?			
The rock gets expa any ma now rock material 			
when heated gets expanded expanded			
 Expanded 			
Expanded when cooled get contracted contracted			
 Contracted 			
Okay			
So variations in temperature how does it afffect this rock ?			
The rocks in the hot summer season gets expanded and when			
the temperature falls in the winter season gets contracted 			
contracted			
 Contracted 			
So this expansion and contraction in the for co			
 for a long in a course of time what happens ?			
The rock become becomes loose 			
It gets weathered 			
It gets weathered it gets weathered and it starts crumbling 			
breaking up into pie breaking up into pie 			
small pieces and from the small pieces into gravel from gravel			
into very fine particle noise and it becomes ultimately 			
sand 			
So the sandy nature of the desert is the result of ?			
<$CH			
 Sand 			
Mechanical weathering			
 Cough 			
Mechanical weathering			
So this mechanical weathering is caused because of uh the			
variations in temperature 			
 Temperature 			
And the variations in temperatures are change in atmosphereic			
conditions okay			
The changes in atmospheric condition			
This uhm we'll just recall what is mechanical			
weathering complete with this Pavle 			
How would you describe mechanical weathering ?			
The disintegration of rock			
Yes the disintegration of rock right 			
Due to what ?			
Disintegrate means what ?			
Breaking up 			
So why how does it break up ?			
The change in temperature			
The change in temperature			
The rise and fall in temperature			
Yes in most in detail 			
Manasi ?			
Teacher dis 			
Just elaborate on the topic			
Disintegration of the uh rock into the chemical process is			
called mechanical weathering			
Yes			
Due to chemical changes uh 			
I am talking of only mechanical weathering			
The changes in the physical temperature so that rock			
changes weathers it then uh it gets uh			
How does it get weathered ?			
The small pieces travels and fallen into the tanks when			
large pieces			
But you haven't explained how does it get weathered ?			
How does it get weathered ?			
If mechanical weathering is uh result of the variations in			
 temperature 			
 Temperature 			
So how does the variations in temperature affect rock ?			
Okay let her answer			
Changes in temperature affect rock when the temperature			
gets more hot the rock uh expand			
The temerature gets more hot or temperature rises			
The rock is expanded and when it cools down the rock the rock			
also get contracted			
Yes			
Due to uh this process of rock finally get uh			
uh rock finally breaks cough up into pieces 			
cough because of more weathering it breaks it to 			
 form sand			
Yes 			
So the sandy nature of uh desert is the result of 			
mechanical weathering 			
 Mechanical weathering 			
Anything more to say ?			
Okay okay			
So this was what is mechanical weathering 			
Now what is chemical weathering ?			
Now this rock material contains various minerals present in it			
Okay see			
 Weathering 			
Now this uh in this atmosphere			
the various components of atmosphere			
What are the various components of atmosphere ?			
If you recall your earlier portion done in the lower			
classes			
What are the various components of atmosphere ?			
Water vapour oxygen gases			
This water vapour gases nitrogen oxygen			
carbondioxide various gases presented present 			
in the organ 			
Then uh dust particles these are all components of the			
atmosphere			
Now now these chemical these components like water uh			
carbondioxide water vapour they change the chemical composition			
of the rock 			
 Rock 			
And when the chemical composition of the rock is changed 			
it is termed as chemical weathering 			
 Chemical weathering 			
Okay 			
So the various other components of the atmosphere like water			
vapour uh then carbondioxide nitrogen and the way other uh			
these organ dust particles they act upon the rocks 			
The chemical composition present in the rocks is changed 			
And this is the results do result 			
And then this is then subjected to various changes			
 even the chemical composition of the rock changes			
Again it gets weathered 			
And this can be termed as chemical weathering 			
So we learnt what is weathering the definition of weathering			
That the weathering can be classified into mechanical we have			
learnt mechanical and chemical 			
 Chemical weathering 			
 Chemical 			
Mechanical is the result of the variations in			
temperature 			
 Variations in temperature 			
While chemical weathering is the			
The chemical composition of the rock is changed			
The chemical composition of the rock is changed 			
Gets changed because of the action of these components			
Components like water-vapour carbondioxide 			
etcetera			
 Water-vapour carbondioxide 			
 Is they act upon the minerals in the rock 			
They act upon the components and the minerals of the rock and 			
 the the composition of this rock is changed 			
So this can be termed as chemical weathering 			
 Chemical weathering 			
Okay 			
Now now we move to uh at now besides the			
variations in temperature besides these uh uhm chemical composition			
getting changed because of the other components in the atmosphere			
There are others also other methods other ways also by			
which the rock is weathered okay 			
I hope you are familiar with the term weathered now			
What do you mean by weathering and what is weathering of the rock			
 ?			
Okay now various other factors are also there			
Now there are various external agents of uh the nature			
Okay which act upon the different components in the atmosphere 			
okay			
Now this external agent can you tell me what are the external			
agents of uh nature ?			
Yes Raja ?			
 One word 			
External agents of nature which acts upon the rocks			
 Wa wa wa wa water 			
Water yes 			
Rain water ground water then glacier spring 			
Seawave wind 			
Yes 			
Wind 			
Wind seawave yes			
They all erode and weathered weather 			
the rock particles in the atmosphere okay			
Now this rain water the rain water which falls on the			
earth surface okay			
They go down in the fo they can they are in			
 form they join the seas they they			
 form rivu rivulet 			
They go into the they get percolated into the			
 ground and they form ground water 			
Other then that the rain water also is the 			
responsible for the weathering of rocks 			
 Rocks 			
How ?			
How is the rain water responsible for weathering of rocks ?			
We saw how the variations in temperature affect the rock			
and how the rocks get weathered okay			
We saw how the chemical components of atmos 			
how the components of atmosphere are act upon the			
minerals in the rock and chem chemical 			
composition gets changed and we saw how weathering takes place 			
Now we shall see how this rain water acts upon the rock and			
how the rock is weathered because of rain water 			
Okay the rain water which falls on the earth cough 			
surface gets into uh it falls and it gets into it also enters the			
rock			
How ?			
The cracks			
From the cracks of the rock they enter the cracks			
 cracks of the rock okay			
So this rain water gets collected in the crack of a			
 the rock 			
 Rock 			
Now when the temperature falls when the temperature			
falls this water doesn't remain as water as well what happens ?			
 It freezes 			
 It freezes in the extreme cool			
temperature the water freezes and forms ice 			
 Ice 			
Now ice requires more place 			
 More place 			
It requires more place than water 			
So what will happen ?			
When they form ice it requires more places and so therefore			
the rock is has to get gets expanded 			
The rock has to get expanded okay			
The rock expands the rock expands and the crack 			
 widen 			
 Widen 			
The crack widen 			
 Widen 			
So this is also again in course of time this doesn't			
happen in a day or two or in a year or two			
In course of time in course of time ultimately what			
happens to those particular rock ?			
The rock			
It gets it disintegrated it gets broken up			
and they the weathering of rock takes place 			
So rain water is another factor which causes 			
weathering which causes weathering			
 Weathering 			
Okay 			
Now uh other creature other the other 			
other than all this even human beings even living beings			
 are responsible for the weathering of rock cough for			
example the rat which burrows itself which makes			
burrows or digs underground soil to live inside that 			
Earthworms there are so many other these creatures			
which live under the soil soil okay 			
So they in course of time by burrowing the soil and eating up the			
 they uh weather the rock they weather the rock material and these			
are also one of the uh causes why the rock gets weathered 			
 Soil 			
 Weathered 			
So today we do a lesson about Mahatma Gandhi who			
was a humanitarian okay 			
Mahatma Gandhi the Father of the Nation was			
the first great leader who not only fired the consciousness of the			
masses for independence but also boldly let the struggle for freedom			
against the British in India 			
And we know that Mahatma Gandhi's weapon for			
freedom was ahimsa 			
 Ahimsa 			
Okay 			
He provided a moral foundation to Indian politics and laid great			
stress on the spirit of fearlessness 			
His autobiography The story of my experiment with			
truth is a classic of our time 			
So he book he wrote many books 			
One of them was The story of my experiment with truth			
 			
And the chapter which we are doing today is from the last			
chapter of this autobiography of his 			
In this extract we see the firm faith of Mahatma Gandhi in			
truth and ahimsa 			
To realise them one must have self-purification in mind 			
word and deed 			
The style is simple and direct and sets the readers thinking			
 noise 			
It is not without a range that I have to take leave of the reader			
And why does he say he has to take leave of the reader ?			
Because it is the last chapter			
Okay			
Don't answer chorus because it is the last last			
chapter of his autobiography okay			
 Last 			
So he says that it causes great pain to him that he is			
taking leave of the reader 			
I had set a high value on my experiment and I do not know			
whether I've been able to do justice to them 			
I can only say that I have spared no pains to give a faithful			
narrative 			
So he says that he has I have set high value to my			
experiment he has attached great importance 			
 Great importance 			
He has attached great ipmortance to his experiments with 			
 truth okay			
 Truth 			
And he is not sure whether he is able to do 			
justice to those experiments with truth okay 			
 Justice to 			
Treat them with fullness and clarity justice 			
To treat them with fullness and clarity 			
So that every one who reads the book will understand what he is			
 writing about 			
I can say that I have spared no pains to give a faithful			
narrative 			
That he's done all that he can do to give 			
the account of truth that appeared to him in the right way as it appeared			
to him 			
To describe truth as it has appeared to me and in the exact manner			
in which I have arrived at has been his ceaseless effort 			
So what has been a ceaseless effort ?			
To speak out the truth and			
Come on yes ?			
To describe truth as as it has appeared to him and in the			
exact manner in which he has arrived at his conclusion			
Okay			
So his ceaseless effort was to ar to describe			
truth as it appeared to him and in which way he arrived at truth			
Okay 			
This exercise has given me inaffable mental peace because it			
has been my fond hope that it might bring faith in truth and 			
ahimsa to the waverers 			
And he says this exercise of reproducing truth as he			
 felt about it as he arrived at truth has given him inaffable			
mental peace undescribable mental peace 			
And why does he say ?			
He says it has given him inaffable mental peace because he has			
always cherished he has always hope that those who work against			
 ahimsa would follow the path of ahimsa 			
once they read the book 			
Okay 			
So it has it was always his desire his cherished			
desire that what was his cherished desire ?			
Yes ?			
After reading the book uh or a everything which is			
 The one who were 			
The one who were waverers and they don't know about truth			
and ahimsa haan that uh 			
it might bring the waverers uh to that			
 Haan 			
In the principle of ahimsa 			
Those who were doubtful about the principle of ahimsa			
 will start following it 			
My uniform experience convinces me that there is no other god 			
than truth 			
So he says that there is only one god and that is 			
truth 			
 Truth 			
And he does not vary in that 			
Okay he is definite about it that there is only one god and that is			
 truth 			
 Truth 			
And if every page of this chapter does not proclaim to the			
reader that the only means for the realisation of truth is ahimsa			
 I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters to have			
been in vain 			
So he says that first of all he is convinced that there			
is only one god and that is truth 			
 Truth 			
And another thing he says that in every chapter of the			
book which book please ?			
My experiment with truth			
His experiment with truth			
Okay 			
In every chapter of his book he has tried to explain that			
if you want to realise truth if you want to reach to the goal of			
truth you have to follow the path of ahimsa 			
 			
 Ahimsa 			
Okay 			
I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters have been 			
in vain			
And he says that in every chapter he has tried to explain 			
that the only means of realisation of truth is ahimsa			
 			
 Ahimsa 			
And if people do not understand it then his writing			
 that book and explaining about the principle of ahimsa			
 is all in vain is futile is useless 			
 In vain 			
Okay 			
So what is Gandhiji's uniform experience convince him ?			
 Gandhiji's uniform experience convinced him that			
there is only one god and that is truth			
Okay 			
And how uh what does he say that the only means to realise			
truth is what ?			
 Ahimsa 			
 Ahimsa 			
The only means to realise truth is ahimsa 			
 Ahimsa 			
Okay 			
And even though my efforts in this belief may prove fruitless			
let the leader re readers know that			
the vehicle and not the great principle is at fault 			
So he says that I he wants to make			
himself very clear that even after reading the chapters of the book if			
people still have doubt about the great principle of ahimsa			
 then they are wrong 			
It is he who is writing the book may be he is not very clear in			
his writing and that is why people have the doubt about ahimsa			
 			
So he that is the vehicle he himself who is writing the book			
 he himself is wrong somewhere and not the principle of 			
 ahimsa 			
 Ahimsa 			
After all however sincere my strivings after 			
ahimsa may have been they have been imperfect and 			
inadequate			
And why he says may be he is wrong ?			
Why does he say that may be he is not exactly correct in			
explaining about ahimsa and writing about ahimsa			
 ?			
Yes ?			
Because his principle of ahimsa is very 			
uh complex and it can not be described in uh simple words			
Yes 			
It is very difficult to describe such a great principle as 			
 ahimsa 			
And he says that whatever he has seen may not be fully the			
full of ahimsa 			
Everything of ahimsa 			
So he said he has tried his level best to describe 			
 ahimsa 			
The fleeting glimpses therefore that I've been able			
to have of truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of			
truth a million times more intense than that of the sun we daily see			
with our eyes 			
And what does he say that he only has fleeting			
glimpses that is vanishing views 			
Okay			
Something which passes off within a minute			
Okay 			
And he says that it is very difficult to explain 			
truth whose radiance is million times more than that of the 			
 sun okay 			
 Sun 			
So the brightness of truth is much more than the			
brightness of the sun 			
 Sun 			
In fact what I have caught is only the plain faintest glimmer			
of the mighty efflugence 			
And he says that the radiance the lustre of truth is so			
 great is so wide that he has only caught the faintest			
glimmer 			
 Faintest glimmer 			
The dim fading light of truth he's got 			
And it passes off 			
 But this but this much I can say			
with assurance as a result of all my experiment that a perfect vision of			
truth can only follow a complete realisation of ahimsa 			
So one more thing he says is that if you want to realise truth			
to the fullest if you want to see truth at its very best then you			
have to follow the path of ahimsa 			
 Ahimsa 			
Know what ahimsa is ?			
Okay			
Follow the principle of ahimsa 			
Only then you can have the full perfect vision of 			
truth okay 			
 Truth 			
So how can you have a complete vision or perfect vision of			
truth ?			
Yes Pinky ?			
We can have perfect vision of truth by realising of 			
ahimsa 			
Only if you realise ahimsa you can have the			
perfect vision of truth			
And how what is the power of truth			
he has described ?			
How has Gandhiji described truth ?			
Yes Ketan ?			
Like an one word 			
Say it in complete 			
Power of truth is			
 Haan the power of truth 			
It is very powerful			
It is very powerful			
It is uh said that it is ?			
Million times more than that of the sun			
Million times more than that of the sun 			
Okay the radiance of truth is million times more than that of			
the sun 			
 Sun 			
To see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face			
to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself			
And if Gandhiji says that if you want to practice 			
ahimsa practice ahimsa which is found			
everywhere the to practice truth which is there uh you			
have to practice ahimsa 			
If you want to realise truth you have to practice 			
ahimsa and the most important thing is you have to love 			
all living creatures and the lowlest uh 			
 the lowest of creation you should love as you love 			
 yourself okay 			
 Creatures 			
 Yourself 			
So to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth			
face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself			
 So one first of all one has to identify oneself with all			
 living creatures and love the lowest of god's creation			
And a man who aspires after that and a man who 			
speak truth okay who speak truth cannot afford to keep out			
of any field of life 			
 One word 			
So a man who is a seeker of truth has to be attached			
to any field of life in which he is involved 			
That is why my devotion of truth has drawn me into the field of			
politics and I can say without the slightest hesitation and yet in			
all humility that those who say that religion has nothing to do with			
politics do not know what religion means 			
Okay			
So he says that his devotion to truth he was a seeker of truth			
always in life 			
And because he was a seeker of truth he was drawn to the field			
of politics 			
He wanted to make politics free from violence and			
that is why he entered politics 			
Okay			
So he says politics also should be free from violence because			
a seeker of truth he has to follow the path of ahimsa			
 ahimsa 			
 Ahimsa 			
Correct			
A seeker of truth has to follow the path of ahimsa			
 			
 Ahimsa 			
And so he says that is why he had enter politics 			
 cough 			
Identification with eveything that live is impossible 			
without self-purification 			
And he says first of all he says that you have to			
identify yourself with all living creatures 			
All creation of god god 			
 God 			
You have to identify yourself amongst all creations of 			
 god 			
 God 			
And he says if you want to identify yourself with all			
creations of god then you have to be self- purified 			
 Self-purified 			
You have to be self-purified cough 			
Without self-purification the observance of the law of 			
ahimsa must remain an empty dream 			
Okay			
And what is this self-purification ?			
Yes ?			
Self-purification means purification in mind word and deed			
Purification of mind word and deed 			
Your thought speech and action 			
 Word and deed 			
 Speech and action 			
Okay 			
So without self-purification he says you cannot follow the			
path of ahimsa 			
And if you don't follow the path of ahimsa you			
cannot realise truth which is god 			
according to Gandhiji 			
 Truth 			
 God 			
 Mahtma Gandhiji 			
Okay 			
God can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart			
So the first important thing of self-purification you have to be			
pure at heart good in your deed good in your 			
thoughts action 			
 Heart 			
God can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart 			
Self-purification therefore must mean purification in all			
walks of life 			
 Life 			
And this is very important because if you are self- purified			
 you are good in thought speech and action 			
 Speech and action 			
If you are good you can make others good 			
okay 			
 Others good 			
So he says that if you are self-purified you will			
naturally see that your surroundings are also purified 			
It is also good 			
And purification being highly infectious purification of			
oneself necessarily leads to the purification of one's 			
 surroundings 			
 Surroundings 			
So what does purification of oneself lead to ?			
Come on yes uh you ?			
Purification of oneself means purification of the			
surroundings			
Of one's surroundings 			
 Surroundings 			
Whereever he is in any walk of life he will see that 			
everything else is also purified is good okay 			
 Purified 			
But the path of self-purification is hard and steep 			
To attain perfect purity one has to become absolutely			
passion-free in thought speech and action to rise above the opposing			
currents of love and hatred attachment and repulsion 			
So he says that we are talking on self- purification but			
it is not very easy to be self-purified because if you want to be			
self-purified you should be absolutely passion-free 			
emotion-free in thought speech and action 			
 Passion-free 			
 Thought speech and action 			
The ant and the grasshopper Somerset Maugham is the			
writer of this fable 			
The fable the ant and the grasshopper 			
is well known 			
It teaches the moral that one must work hard and save for the future			
The famous British writer Somerset Maugham deals with a very			
 conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go lucky younger			
brother in this prose 			
Why does he refer to the fable ?			
What is his attitude to having moralising ?			
You will find the answer in this prose 			
When I was a very small boy I was made to learn by heart 			
certain of the fable of La Fontaine 			
And the moral of this was carefully explained to me 			
Among those I learnt was the ant and the grasshopper which			
is devised to bring home to the young the usefulnesses that			
 an im imperfect world 			
industry is rewarded and greedyness punished 			
It is the meaning of fable 			
My apology for telling something when everyone in politely			
but inexactly supposed to know the ant spends a laborious summer			
 gathering its winter store while the grasshopper sings on a bale of			
grass singing to the sun 			
Winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but			
the grasshopper has an empty larder 			
He goes to the ant and begs for a little food 			
Then the ant gives him a classic answer 			
What were you doing in the summer time ?			
Saving your presence I sang all day all night 			
You sang why then go and dance 			
I don't ascribe it to perversity on my part but rather to			
the habit of childhood which is deficient in moral sense that I could			
never quite see those advantage to the lesson			
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for some time I			
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 			
In this summary and as I have discovered since entirely human			
fashion I sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense			
I could not help thinking of this fable when the other day I saw			
 George Ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant 			
I never saw anyone wore an expression of such deep gloom			
He was staring into space 			
He looked as though the burden of the whole world fell on his			
shoulders shoulders 			
I was sorry for him 			
I suspected at once that his unfortunate brother has been			
causing trouble again 			
I went up to him and held out my hand 			
Take down the difficult words 			
You read out the words 			
 Haan 			
 BB-Writing begin Prudent - careful happy go			
lucky - carefree larder - room where food is kept Martin 			
- French man greedyness - lack of industry -			
hardwork greedyness - irresponsible behaviour conscientious			
 - honest BB-Work ends Noise 			
Prudent - careful happy go lucky - carefree larder - a			
room where food is kept Martin - traditional efficient lack of			
industry hardwork greedyness - irresponsible behaviour 			
conscientious - honest 			
The ant and the grasshopper it is a fable 			
Fable means a short story which deals with the animal and it			
gives us a moral 			
So fable the ant and the grasshopper it is based on and is			
famous and it also teaches the moral that one must work hard 			
and one will should save for the future			
So this moral we will get from this lesson the ant and the			
grasshopper 			
It is written by the famous British writer Somerset Maugham 			
The famous British writer Somerset Maugham he deals with a very			
 conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go lucky			
younger brother in this story 			
So we have two brothers which is one is very careful			
prudent and conscientious very honest and another is very			
carefree happy go lucky			
They are the two brothers in this story 			
Why does he refer to the fable ?			
What is his attitude to having moralising ?			
You will find the answers in it			
So first the writer has given the fable the story 			
about the ant and the grasshopper 			
When I was a very small boy I was made to learn by heart 			
certain of the fables of La Fontaine is a French poet and the			
scholar 			
And the moral of this was carefully explained to me 			
Among those I learnt was ant and the grasshopper which is			
devised to bring home to the young the usefulness that in an 			
imperfect world industry is rewarding 			
 It's always hardwork industry means hardwork it is			
rewarding			
If you do the hardwork you will get the prize which is a reward 			
And greedyness is punished 			
 Greedyness irresponsible behaviour in this parable 			
If you do you will be punished in this world 			
So this is the moral of this lesson 			
It is a reasonable fable the ant spends the laborious			
summer gathering its winter store 			
So throughout the summer season the ant worked very hard			
and gathered its food for the winter season 			
While the grasshopper it sit sits on			
a bale of grass and is singing to the sun 			
So instead of doing the work grasshopper in vain waste			
the whole time in singing instead of doing the work 			
While the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun			
 winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but the			
grasshopper has an empty larder 			
Larder the room where the food is kept 			
So the ant it has full of larder whereas the			
 grasshopper's is empty 			
He goes to the ant and begs for a little food 			
See what the ant says the ant says			
Then the ant gives him a classic answer			
There is a traditional answer 			
What were you doing in the summer time ?			
She is not ready to give food for to 			
the grasshopper 			
Then the grasshopper answers saving your presence I			
sang all day all night 			
So throughout the day and night the grasshopper 			
waste wastes his time in singing 			
You sang why then go and dance 			
So like this the ant gave the answer 			
She is not ready to give the food to the grasshopper 			
I don't ascribe this 			
So here the writer refers to the story I don't ascribe this to			
perversity on my part but rather to the habit of childhood which is			
deficient in moral sense 			
So this story it is lack of moral sense in his childhood			
 that I couldn't never first reconcile myself to the lesson 			
So which is moral of the lesson the author is not agreeing			
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime I			
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 			
So here the writer has a big sympathy for the grasshopper 			
not for the ant 			
So this reference we'll get in the story of this			
reference 			
Why the author showed the sympathy to the grasshopper ?			
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime I			
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 			
In this a few words I sought to express my			
disapproval of prudence and common sense 			
So he is not agreeing about the prudence that he could not			
It was not being careful that is a prudence 			
I could not help thinking for this fable when the other day I			
saw George Ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant 			
So in this story there are two brothers one is George Ramsay			
and another is Tom Ramsay 			
So next day the writer saw George Ramsay in restaurant 			
I never saw anyone wear an expression of such deep gloom 			
So he was in very sad mood 			
He was staring into space or looking to the sky 			
He looked as if the the burden of the whole world fell on his			
 shoulders 			
I was sorry for him I suspected at once that his			
unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again 			
So he was worried about his younger brother Tom Ramsay 			
I went upto him and held out my hand 			
So who are the two brothers ?			
George Ramsay and			
 One or two words 			
 George Ramsay 			
The two brothers were George Ramsay and Tom Ramsay 			
How is George Ramsay ?			
He was prudent 			
George Ramsay was prudent 			
George Ramsay was prudent 			
Then how was Tom Ramsay ?			
Nishan ?			
Tom Ramsay was a was carefree 			
Look at the page and say 			
He was a happy go lucky 			
Who is the author of this lesson ?			
The author of the lesson is Somerset Maugham 			
Yes ?			
The author of the lesson is Somerset Maugham 			
How the ant spent its time in summer season ?			
The ant spent a laborious summer gathering its winter			
store 			
The the ant spent laborious summer collecting 			
collecting the winter food 			
How the grasshopper spent its time ?			
Arun ?			
The grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing 			
Singing to the 			
Singing to the in summer 			
Come on tell ?			
The grasshopper sits on grass and that of grass singing			
the singing 			
Yes 			
In summer the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to			
the sun 			
So who is labourous here ?			
Ant			
Ant ant 			
What is the moral of the story ?			
Shweta ?			
The moral of the story is that one must work hard and save			
for the future 			
Read yes read it sit down cough 			
Come on you are not copying 			
The fable the ant and the grasshopper is well known 			
It teaches the moral that one must work hard and save for the			
future 			
The famous British writer Somerset Maugham deals with a very 			
conscien conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go			
lucky younger brother in this story 			
Why does he refer to the fable ?			
What is his attitude to have been moralising ?			
You will find the answer in this story			
Teacher teacher 			
Now a few words cough 			
When I was 			
When I was 			
When I was a very small boy I was made to learn by heart			
certain of the fables of La Fontaine and the moral of these was carefully			
 explain to me 			
Among those I among those I learnt was the ant and the			
grasshopper which is devised to bring home to the young and 			
 the useful lesson that is in an imperfect world industry is rewarded			
and greedyness punished 			
It is admirable fable I apologise for telling something which			
everyone is politely but inexactly suppose supposed to know			
The ant spends a laborious summer gathering its winter store			
while the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun 			
Winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but the			
grasshopper has an empty larder 			
He goes to the ant and begs for a little food			
Then the ant gives him a classic answer			
Teacher			
Teacher			
What were you doing in the summer time ?			
Saving saving your presence I sang all day all day 			
You sang why then go and dance 			
I don't I do not asc ascribe 			
 it to per perversity on my part 			
but rather to the habit of childhood which is defecient in moral sense			
that I could never recon reconcile 			
myself to the lesson			
 My sympathies 			
 Sit down 			
Jaya sit down 			
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime			
I never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 			
In this summary and as and as I have dis 			
 discovered since entirely human fashion I sought to			
express my disapproval of prudence and common sense Noise 			
Now who you read it			
I could not help thinking of this of			
this fable when the other day I saw George George			
Ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant 			
I never saw anyone wore an express expression of			
 such deep gloom 			
 Gloom 			
He was start starting staring			
 into space 			
Staring into space Another student 			
Staring into space			
He looked as though the burden of the whole world sat on his			
shoulders 			
 Noise another student I was sorry for him			
I was sorry for him 			
I 			
I suspected			
I suspected			
Suspected at once that his un 			
Unfortunate			
Unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again			
I went			
Teacher			
Teacher			
 Noise several students talk together 			
Thank you very much 			
 Area and volume of a regular solid 			
So what is a regular solid ?			
A regular solid is one in which all the sides and angles are			
 equal 			
 Equal 			
Can you observe here ?			
Yes sir			
All sides and angles are equal			
Yes sir 			
So what is the name of this figure ?			
What is the name of this solid ?			
Prism prism			
Yes this is called prism			
Prism 			
Now observe this face of this prism 			
So here this is what is it's top			
Top 			
This is base base and these are height			
 height 			
 Base 			
 Height 			
The lateral faces			
Lateral faces			
Now see this shape of what is it is of base and its 			
 lateral faces 			
 Lateral faces 			
And now the shape of shape of what is it base and			
lateral faces are different 			
Shape of lateral faces and base are different 			
 Different 			
Now compare these lateral faces only 			
What is the shape of the lateral faces ?			
Rectangular rectangular			
Rectangular faces 			
 Faces 			
And compare to what is it ?			
Rectangular			
Compare the top and the base			
Base 			
What is the name of this one ?			
Square			
Square base isn't it ?			
Now see the top as well as what is it the lateral faces			
 how these two are there ?			
Which ?			
Top as well as lateral lateral face 			
Are these perpendicular to one another ?			
 Lateral 			
Yes sir			
No sir yes sir 			
Lateral faces and the coordinator the base are			
 perpendicular to each other 			
 Perpendicular to each other 			
Understood ?			
Yes sir			
So such a figure or such a solid is known as what does it			
is ?			
Prism 			
And here this figure that is prism has how many faces ?			
Six faces			
Six faces			
Sir Shailaja patil 			
Here this prism is having what is it is square shaped 			
face			
Therefore this is called square based prism 			
And let's take another prism which has three			
lateral faces 			
Understood ?			
So here what is the shape of the lateral face ?			
Rectangle			
Rectangle or rectangular face			
And shape of the top of the top and the bases 			
 Triangular shape 			
Triangle bases			
So this prism is called ?			
 Triang 			
 Triangular based prism 			
 Triangular based prism 			
Now we want to find what is it is surface area 			
Do you know how to find the surface area ?			
Or do you know how to find the area of a rectangle ?			
Yes			
How do you find the area of a rectangle ?			
Half base into height			
Area of a rectangle			
Length into breadth			
 Length into breadth 			
 Length into breadth 			
And how do you find the area of a square ?			
Side into side side into side			
Side into side because all the sides are equal in			
 square 			
 Square 			
Now see here			
How to find the surface area of what is it is prism ?			
In order to find what is its total surface area what we should			
do ?			
Total surface area here we can find what is it is the area			
of rectangle rectangle			
 Rectangle 			
That is of one shape 			
Similarly you can find the area of this shape			
Similarly you can find the area of this shape			
Means we can find the areas of quadrilateral lateral faces 			
And we can also find what is it is areas of top as well as 			
 base 			
 Base 			
So total surface area means what ?			
Total surface area ?			
Now we can calculate the what is it surface area of what			
is it each face 			
But to uhm find the what is total surface area ?			
It means what we have to do ?			
We have to find the we have to find the sum of the what is it			
is areas of all these faces 			
So total surface area include the area of what is it is the			
lateral faces as well as the area of what is it top and base 			
 Base 			
Now here we have the what is it is model 			
Model of the prism 			
Understood ?			
Can you prepare a model of this type ?			
Yes sir			
So you can cut out the shape of a prism in cardboard 			
Now here see you have what is it is prism			
And you have prepared what is it model and open it up 			
When you open it up what happens ?			
You will get what is it is figure of this prism 			
Yes sir 			
Do you get the figure of this kind or not ?			
Yes sir 			
Suppose here the length of the what is it is 			
Prism			
The length of the what is it is			
Prism 			
Rectangle			
Rectangle			
Taking the rectangle 			
Length of the rectangle is eight centimetres and its			
breadth is A centimetres 			
 A centimetres 			
Now here do you see that part ?			
Do you find that it is a big rectangle ?			
They are not the same 			
And here what are these ?			
Square 			
Yes what are these actually ?			
 Top and the base 			
 Top 			
 Base 			
Right 			
So it means we want to find what is the total surface area of the			
prism 			
To find the total surface area of the prism what we have to do ?			
We have to find and we have to add the surface areas of these			
lateral fa faces plus what is it ?			
The base is			
The area of the top and the base 			
 Base 			
Right 			
So total BB Writing surface area area of			
prism is equal to what is it is area of top and			
base plus area of			
 And base 			
Rectangle 			
Area of			
Lateral faces 			
Four rectangles			
Four rectangles four rectangle			
Yes sir 			
So area of top and bases			
These two have the shape of a square 			
Therefore what you can write here ?			
Area of base into two because these two have what is			
it is same area 			
These two squares have same area 			
Plus what is it is area of four rectangle 			
Now compare here all the rectangles have same height 			
Yes sir 			
That is same length and they have same breadth that is A			
centimetre 			
Understood ?			
So area of four rectangles what you can write four into 			
area of a rectangle 			
Area of a rectangle 			
 Rectangle 			
Now how do you find the area of a rectangle here ?			
And how do you find the area of a square ?			
Just find out this one 			
So what is the formula to find the area of a square ?			
Side into side			
Side into side 			
 side 			
So here area of base these are base but the bases			
have the what is it shape of what is it square therefore what is the			
formula here ?			
Side into side			
What is the side of the square ?			
A			
A			
A			
A square 			
A			
Therefore area of base into two is equal to what			
you can write two into A square 			
 Two into A square 			
Plus four 			
 Two 			
Sir four			
Four 			
Now find the area of a rectangle			
How do you find the area of a rectangle ?			
We require length and breadth 			
 breadth 			
So what is the length of the rectangle here ?			
H			
H centimetres and breadth of the			
A 			
So it is length into what is it is breadth			
Breadth 			
Understood ?			
Now here two into A square plus four into A 			
Four into A 			
 A 			
Four into A means what it gives us ?			
Four A square 			
Four into A four A's are here A plus A 			
plus A plus A means what is it ?			
Four A square			
What is it ?			
A length			
Yes what is the length of this side A			
A			
This is A this is A this is A			
 A 			
 A 			
You are adding A four times 			
 Four times 			
It means what it gives you ?			
Four A four uh four A 			
Breadth of four triangles 			
Length of 			
Breadth of four triangles 			
Not breadth man			
Sit down 			
That is called as perimetre 			
This is the perimetre uhm 			
Perimetre means what ?			
Sum of the sides 			
Sum of the sides			
Do you know that ?			
Yes sir			
So here we can do what is it sum of the sides of this 			
base			
Base			
So four A means what is it is two A square plus four A			
 into what is it base			
Base 			
So two A square means what is it two into area of the			
base BB Writing base plus plus four perimetre			
 Plus four 			
Perimetre of the base into height BB close 			
Height 			
Height of what is it ?			
Prism			
Height of the prism 			
It is as well as height of the rectangle 			
 Rectangle 			
Height of the prism 			
So will you solve an example now ?			
Yes sir 			
So let's see the model example that is given			
here 			
Find the total surface area of a prism with square base 			
in which the side of the square base is four centimetres and height			
 six centimetres 			
So what is given in this problem I shall write here just here			
 Blackboard work 			
Find the total surface area surface area of a prism 			
prism with a square base with a square base in which the			
side of the square is four centimetres and height six			
centimetres BB work end 			
Yes what is given in the problem ?			
Side and height			
Side of the what is it is square base and height of the			
 prism is given 			
Then what we have to find here ?			
Total surface			
Total surface area 			
Now here we've derived what is formula to			
calculate what is it is total surface area of the prism 			
 Prism 			
So what is the formula to calculate the total surface			
area of the prism ?			
Two into area of the base plus perimetre of the base			
Simple			
 Into area of the base plus perimetre of the base 			
Height into height plus base 			
So substitute these values in your what does it is 			
formula 			
So total surface area BB work begin total surface			
area is equal to BB work end what is given ?			
Two area of square			
Area of the base 			
 Base 			
How do you calculate area of the base ?			
Four into four 			
Has he given the side of the base ?			
Yes sir yes			
Here 			
What is the length of this one ?			
Four centimetres			
If this is four can you calculate the area of this base ?			
Yes sir			
How do you calculate it ?			
Side into side 			
 BB work begin 			
Area of the base is equal to what is it is			
 four into four that is equal to sixteen 			
what is it square centimetres square 			
centimetres BB work end 			
 Base 			
 Four into four 			
 Sixteen 			
 Square centimetres 			
 Centimetres 			
So here two into area of the base			
What is the area of the base ?			
Sixteen square centimetres			
 BB work begins 			
Square centimetres BB work end plus 			
perimetre of the base 			
So how do you find perimetre ?			
 Centimetres 			
That is nothing but what is it sum of the sides 			
So here how do you find the perimetre ?			
Sum of the sides of what is it is base 			
So what is the length of this base ?			
 Four centimetres 			
 Four centimetres 			
Four plus four plus four plus four 			
 Plus four plus four 			
Sixteen			
So here we can calculate and what is it is all the sides or			
you can also multiply the side of the square by four			
So what is the length of the side here ?			
Four A four 			
What is the length of the ?			
Four four			
Four centimetres			
 BB work begins 			
So four into four 			
 Four 			
And what is the height of the prism ?			
Three

Height of the prism is three six centimetres			
 Three 			
Now solve this one 			
Here two into sixteen centimetres			
 Sixteen Noise 			
Thirty-two square centimetres 			
 Square centimetres 			
Square centimetres plus sixty here 			
 twenty-two four into four sixteen plus six 			
 twenty-two thirty-two plus what is it is ?			
 Sixty 			
 Twenty-two 			
 Sixteen 			
 twenty-two 			
Twenty-two 			
Twenty-two so			
Fifty-four 			
Fifty four square centimetres 			
 Four square centimetres 			
Begin the chapter The Indian Constitution 			
In that we will be seeing the salient features of the Indian			
Constitution 			
Uh we know that India was not free 			
Nineteen forty-seven August fifteen India became free 			
But along with freedom we needed some framework of laws 			
Laws and bye-laws for a better government 			
The British had laws but they were laws more favourable to them 			
So therefore we needed to make laws that are favourable to us			
Therefore we will see the chapter the Indian			
Constitution Cough 			
When we talk about the Indian Constitution we are talking			
about the ideals of the freedom-fighters 			
The ideals of the people the ideals of the people around the			
world 			
That is why we are going to see in this chapter what are the			
ideals ?			
Or what are the ideas upon which our laws or our bye-laws or			
our constitution is based ?			
Therefore we will consider the salient features of the Indian			
Constitution 			
In nineteen forty-seven nineteen forty-six we had the 			
Constituent Assembly or a group of people who would be studying the			
various constitutions of the world and then formulating a constitution			
 based on the study of the various constitutions of the world our own			
constitution 			
The Constituent Assembly was the large body			
It was not possible that uh all people would take part uh			
in the actual work of framing the constitution			
Therefore a smaller body was formed a smaller body was taken			
 known as the drafting committee 			
The drafting committee had a specific task 			
The drafting committee had a specific task			
Number one of studying the constitutions of the world and number			
two of forming or creating a draft of our constitution 			
What we mean by a draft is not necessary that it is the final product			
No 			
It could have changed 			
Therefore they made a a draft so that we could study the			
Constituent Assembly could study the draft and then if they required they			
would make the necessary changes before the final constitution could be made			
The chairman of the drafting committee was Dr B R Ambedkar 			
and it had a various members on it 			
Dr B R Ambedkar was chosen because of many aspects 			
He was uh good at law 			
He had studied abroad uh he was an individual who was 			
interested in uh the upliftment of the poor 			
He was an individual who was involved in the reform uh in the			
movement the national movement 			
And therefore he was chosen as the uh the chairman for the			
drafting committee whose main work was to prepare the draft studying the			
various constitutions of the world 			
Therefore the drafting committee collected the work of drafting			
the constitution and placing it before the Constituent Assembly 			
The Constituent Assembly published the constitution the draft of the			
constitution throughout India 			
All the members of the Constituent Assembly studied the draft 			
All the members of the drafting committees studied the draft 			
All the eminent people in India 			
All the teachers and those who were really interested in the real			
ideals and the future of the country studied the draft 			
And there was a provision that any individual who thought fit 			
that a certain change must be brought about in the draft wrote to the			
Constituent Assembly 			
They made their remarks 			
They said something in favour and somethings against a particular			
clause of the draft 			
Therefore with this process of bringing out a change for the			
better finally the Constituent Assembly took into consideration all these			
suggestions and made the Constitution of India 			
The Constitution of India was formulated 			
The Constitution of India was applied 			
The Constitution of India is in use 			
But many a times we don't realize its important			
We don't realize its salient features in our 			
in other words important essential features of the			
Constitution			
And therefore we don't realize its importance 			
We know it is there			
But if we do not know what is in there ? Cough 			
So we'll consider some of the salient features of the			
Indian Constitution Constitution 			
The first thing that we will consider is the preamble 			
Preamble is the most important part of the Indian Constitution 			
We could consider it as a a a magnacarta of the 			
India Indian Constitution			
We could consider it as an important introduction 			
 We will we could consider it as an			
important uh core of the Constitution 			
Why because in the preamble lies the important principles for			
which India uh is known for 			
For which the Constitution was made 			
For which the people of India fought for which we live 			
Therefore the preamble is very very important 			
Now we will see what is there in the preamble for us to jot down			
 note offered to observe or study 			
Number one 			
The main thing that is stressed in the preamble is the			
soverrignty of the people in the world we We the people of			
India 			
We the people of India formulate the constitution 			
We the people of India make and adopt the constitution 			
We the people of India have these ideas uh in our constitution			
therefore it is not I previously we had monarchy a King would			
have his own constitution at his uh whims and fancies 			
He would have a constitution and based on that the country would			
be ruled			
But sometimes even they wouldn't follow what was said 			
They would change constitution would change 			
The people would change 			
And therefore it was I I the king or I the Queen declares			
such and such a thing			
There was nothing uh any more like that to be			
Therefore we the people we declared to ourselves we adopt			
the constitution we have these ideals for ourselves 			
That is why the power of the people is very much imposed in			
we 			
And that's a very important aspect 			
Never before in India was such a principle stipulated			
That is the basis of democracy 			
We that's basis of uh our functioning now 			
It was not there before			
But it happened when we became free			
Therefore the sovereignty of the people was established or			
made clear in the preamble 			
The second point that we see are the different principles that			
are enshrined uh in the uh preamble 			
Enshrined in other words mentioned in the preamble stipulated in			
the preamble uh put forth in the preamble			
And those principles are sovereign cough socialist			
 secular democratic republic			
 India to be India to be a			
sovereign socialist secular democratic republic 			
Now we will see what every word means 			
So that we will have a better understanding of uh the			
preamble and also of these basic principles which are there in the			
preamble 			
Sovereign			
When we talk of the word sovereign we know that prior to independence			
India was not sovereign 			
In other words India was not free 			
In other words someone else was ruling on our territory 			
In other words the pre people 			
were the subject and the rulers were someone else 			
Also another aspect of this was that the people were not having their			
own government 			
There was one monarchy 			
So all that was there prior to independence was different 			
Therefore India was declared to be sovereign indicating that 			
India is free indicating that no other country has any power over India			
Indicating that India is free to make its own laws and its own			
constitution 			
That is why that word sovereign 			
Sovereign means all powerful all powerful 			
So it very plainly lays down the principle of India being free			
 India being independent and that was very essential for us			
That is why the people or the freedom fighters fought for			
They wanted to be free 			
They were not going to be satisfied with anything short of 			
sovereignty			
Therefore the first principle of being sovereign 			
When we talk of the word socialist or socialism there was			
socialism in the world uh when India was striving for freedom 			
Socialism in Russia socialism in China and other parts of			
the world 			
Socialism was uh stipulating or bringing out the idea that all			
people are equal and therefore the property the land and the wealth			
of the country must be divided equally 			
In that everything belongs to the state and nothing belongs to			
an individual 			
Therefore socialism because of India's specific			
condition because of the condition of the masses which was very pathetic			
in those days 			
Therefore socialism was liken by the people of India			
And therefore it was framed 			
But the socialism that we adopted was not that of Russia or			
China or not that kind where everything was owned by the nation 			
where everything was nationalized 			
Nothing was private 			
It was of that kind of socialism that we adopted 			
The the peculiar brand of socialism that we adopted the peculiar			
kind of socialism that we had was mixed economy 			
Mixed economy means that part of the economic activity in India			
 would be nationalized and part of the economic activity in India			
would be private 			
Therefore all those important industries which are of national			
benefit are nationalized 			
Banks are nationalized mines are nationalized 			
All wealth of nations 			
Therefore those railways are natioanlized			
They are the wealth 			
They are for the importance of all the people 			
They are for the need of all the people			
Therefore those uh industries or that part of the economy which			
is required by all is nationalized 			
And that part which uh remains in the hands of the private			
people			
There are some industries which belong to the private people			
So therefore we have a mixed eco economy			
 			
Nationalised economy and private economy			
So our kind of socialism is not that which is likened to the			
socialism in Russia or in China 			
Secular is the next next uh ideal			
that we have chosen 			
Secular or secularism we might wonder what it is 			
There are a few countries in the world which have a state			
religion specially in the middle-east there is the state religion			
But there are other countries who follow democracy which do not have			
a state religion 			
India was also a country which acquired independence in nineteen			
forty-seven where there were important major religions in India 			
Jainism Buddhism Hinduism Sikhism Christianity and so on and			
so forth 			
Now in a situation like this the leaders were confronted with a			
dilemma or problem where they didn't know what to decide or			
which religion should get importance though there was a Hindu majority			
 there was a Muslim minority there was a Christian minority 			
Therefore importance could not be given on the basis of religion 			
So they opted for a secular state indicating that India will			
not propogate any state religion that India is secular state			
 that India will not be biased to favour one religion and not			
favour the other			
Therefore all religions are equal in the eyes of the state 			
No religion is more important than the other 			
Does not matter whether it has the majority or a minority of			
followers 			
Therefore this ideal of secularism was very favourable so that			
all could survive within India 			
So that all would peacefully live as they have been doing for			
centuries 			
The Hindus and the Muslims the Hindus Muslims and the Christians			
These Hindus Muslims Christians Jains and the Buddhists had been			
surviving for the centuries together and therefore it was thought that			
they would continue to stay in a secular state together as they had been			
doing before 			
The next ideal that we have is democratic republic 			
Democracy as defined by Abraham Lincoln it's			
 a form of government where the power lies with the people 			
 it's a form of govrnment which is of the people by			
the people and for the people 			
 A very a very uh a very ideal thought 			
a very ideal uh type of government 			
Therefore whatever is done the people are responsible whatever			
is decided the people are responsible because it is for the benefit of			
the people 			
And the functioning of that gevernment will also be by the people			
 uh with the method of election 			
So a very ideal pattern that was choosen for India was democracy			
Socialism was there a very a very a			
very uh likeable ideal because there was a a difference			
of rich and poor in India			
If socialism uh if socialism was adopted in India as it was in			
Russia or China perhaps the country country could			
have been made economically different 			
But in other matters it would have been different			
Therefore they chose democratic republic 			
We were free and we will rule the country that is why we the			
people the sovereignty of the people 			
Republic in that we had our own constitution 			
We did not mean the uh the constitution of another country			
to rule us 			
But we formulated our own constitution therefore it was a democratic			
republic 			
Therefore it's a very balanced view that of the			
constitution that we get in the preamble			
We the people rule the country and those principles which will			
make India a strong state is sovereign secular socialist 			
democratic republic 			
Okay today we are going to do the topic Cell			
Specialisation that is how cells are specialised to form			
tissues 			
So far we have learnt all about mi uh unicellular			
organisms 			
Okay			
How a single plant looks plant cell looks 			
 like ?			
How a single animal cell looks like ?			
What all it contains ?			
What are the organisms within a cell ?			
Also now we have to study how many cells are arranged			
together or when they are grouped together what do they form ?			
What is the form of cell organization ?			
Please raise your hands 			
A collection of cells 			
Forms ?			
Tissues			
Tissues 			
So this is what we are going to study a collection of cells 			
forms a particular tissue and why are the cells organized together to			
form the tissues ?			
 It's because they have to carry out a specific			
function 			
So far you have seen that one single cell carry carries out all the			
activity 			
Now when a group of cells get get together they will carry out			
 the same activity but at a larger level			
At the more quicker rate of doing it 			
One cell and ten cells doing the work 			
It is just like one person doing one work and ten			
persons doing the same amount of work 			
Which will get over faster ?			
 Ten persons 			
 Ten persons doing the amount of work			
So the specialisation of cell to form a tissue is to carry			
out a work and this is mainly found up in higher animals and plants 			
Now the definition of the tissue is a group of cells			
 specialised for a particular function 			
Okay			
A group of cells specialised for a particular function to			
perform may be absorption of water in the plants or to perform uh			
energy uh energy production 			
Okay that is work in plants and animals 			
Or like chlorophyll production in plants or the enzyme			
production in animals 			
So for a typical function in the cells are grouped together a			
set of cells are known as tissues 			
Today we are going to study about the types of, plant tissues			
as well as animal tissues 			
The plants and animals are totally different from each other			
Both of them are basically living organisms 			
But what is that one one feature which distinguishes plants			
and animals ?			
Plants prepare their own food 			
And animals do not prepare their own food ?			
They take it from others from the plants			
What is it present in the plant cell ?			
Chlorophyll 			
The presence of chlorophyll			
What is chlorophyll ?			
Green colour 			
Green colouring matter			
Green colouring matter 			
What does this green colouring matter do ?			
What ability does it have ?			
Yes ?			
It gives the green colour to plant			
No 			
It is brown 			
No			
Yes uh anybody ?			
It absorbs the heat of the sun			
It is the only substance from which the plant which has the			
ability to absorb the sun's rays 			
Do you understand any animals which can absorb the sun's 			
light and prepare their own energy ?			
No no			
So the green chlorophyll that is uh the green colouring			
matter the green pigment within the cell of a plant has the ability			
to absorb out the sun's rays and convert it uh use it for			
the preparation of starch that is the basic food material of plant 			
Now what are the plant tissues ?			
Plant tissues are of two types one is 			
meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue 			
 Meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue			
 			
For example ?			
And the second is ?			
Permanent tissues 			
Now meristematic tissues are usually found at the tip			
where tips of the plants where active growth is taking place 			
Like the tip of the root the tip of the shoot that is			
when leaves are being produced or the bud that the bud is going to			
give rise to a plant or the lateral graticules which you are going to			
give direct to the animal plant cell and leaves etcetra or the auxillary			
bud 			
What does the auxillary bud forms ?			
Uh auxillary bud is the thing which will give rise to leaves			
etcetra 			
Now meristematic tissues are uh those cells which are found at			
the tips of actively growing parts of the plant 			
These cells are polygonal in shape and it has a centrally			
 placed large nucleus a very dense cytoplasm and they do not have			
any vacuoles in them			
No air pins are present and there are no intercellular spaces			
within these meristematic tissues okay			
And these tissues are contrary devices they form in larger size and			
give rise to a new set of cell 			
And the main function is to form new tissues for the plants 			
Then you have the second set of plant uh the second set of			
tissues sorry and that is the permanent tissues 			
 Permanent tissues 			
Now in the permanent tissues you have again two types as			
Simple permanent			
Simple permanent and			
 Complex tissues 			
 Complex tissues 			
Okay 			
The simple permanent tissues are they are not uh very			
complex in their structure and also their functions are not very high			
That is they do not have to perform extremly vital			
functions for the plant 			
Vital means those functions which are vital for the life of			
the plant			
So the uh to see that the plant keeps alive 			
Okay 			
These types of tissues will perform certain functions and the vital			
functions are the permanent permanent tissues			
And the simple tissues the simple form of permanent tissues			
are the one which form a support adding support for the plant or which			
forms the main structure of the stem or the root or the leaves 			
And it provides support mechanical support to the plant and to			
some extent they also help in preparing food for the plant 			
Okay you have learnt about plastid in our previous chapter 			
Then we have learnt Plastid as the starch 			
One is the 			
 Chlor Chloroplast 			
Please raise your hands 			
Girls Durga ?			
Chloroplast			
Yes			
 Chloroplast chrmoplast and one word 			
 Chloroplast chrmoplast and one word 			
Now chloroplast is the one that absorbs the sunlight 			
Chromoplast gives colour colour to the plant other			
than these and it use of flower is very important one with			
starch present in the flower 			
 Colour 			
So the simple permanent tissues some of them I mean the			
leaf or flower and as well found in the preparation of starch one word			
The preparing of the one word now suppose if you put			
simple permanent tissues in the two words 			
There is no simple permanent tissues when the name of five a			
few words and these which help out in the preparation of starch			
Okay now which are the type of simple permanent tissues we			
have to see 			
The first one is parenchyma the second is 			
collenchyma collenchyma and the third and the third is			
 sclerenchyma 			
 Collenchyma 			
 And the third is 			
 Sclernchyma 			
We are learning what is it ?			
 Noise 			
Okay now out of these simple permanent tissues 			
the most simple structure is of a parenchyma cell			
These are usually green in colour they are spherical 			
root in cell there are lot of intercellular spaces in between them 			
They have a large nucleus and many vacuoles around			
along the thin cyctoplasm plus the other cell uh cellular orgnelles			
are present 			
And they are filled with a number of plastids 			
These plastids help in the preparation of food 			
The parenchyma cells that is revived they are circular in			
shape loosely spaced having a lot of inter-cellular spaces 			
The cell walls are thin and they have a large nucleus which			
push to one side by the secondary based vacoule plus the plastids are			
present in large number in the case of parenchyma cells 			
Plastids are not are present in the leaves and the 			
cells			
And if you have to release the very green in colour in the			
presence of the green colour plant 			
Then we have a second okay the function of the parenchyma			
is preparation of food 			
The second type of cells are the collenchyma cells 			
These have got a very definite structure and they			
provide mechanical strength to the whole plant 			
There is a charact characteristic			
 thing about the collenchyma is that they are a firm			
thickening at the corners of the four corners of the cell 			
This is one of the characteristic features of the collenchyma			
cells that is the cell corners show thickening of a specific substance			
The thickening is made up of cellulose plus pectine 			
Okay 			
These are substances which are found uh mainly in plant uh			
plant bodies rather than animal cells 			
Do you know that the cell wall in in plant is made up of			
cellulose which you studied in your lower classes 			
Okay but uh collenchyma cells are made up of uh additional			
substance called pectine which gives it more strength or which makes it more			
tougher than the normal other cells 			
Even though parenchyma cells contain cellulose in their cell			
walls yet uh which gives it a definite shape around the around			
the structure 			
But uh collenchyma cells are I told you they provide			
mechanical support to the plants and for this sake they have to contain a			
certain hard structure in their cell body 			
And this is made by a combination of cellulose plus pectine			
and this is fo found in the presence of			
in the form of cell thickenings at the corners of the cell 			
Also then the rest of the structures are there like the vacuole or			
 nucleus the other chloroplasts and the cytoplasm 			
So remember collenchyma provide mechanical support to the plant			
body 			
They are mostly present in the outer layers of a structure like			
 the periphery of the leaf uh of the cross section of the leaf or 			
the borders of the stem 			
Okay the outer walls of the stem to give that thickness to the			
stem or the outer walls of the root are all made up of collenchyma cells			
and it gives that stiffness to the plant 			
Do you understand ?			
Now the last type of permanent permanent tissues uh sorry			
simple permanent tissues is the sclerenchyma cells 			
These are single shaped cells and as it is growing			
or as it is maturing what happens is the central part of the cell 			
starts moving in cytoplasm 			
And in fact the part gets tougher after sometime and it it			
becomes very hard and tough 			
And the collection of sclerenchyma forms uh structure			
called as one word 			
What do they form ?			
 One word 			
 One word 			
Okay this is the one word formed in the			
sclerenchyma cells start moving and start moving moving out in the inner			
part of the cytoplasm			
And what what is important is that the sclerenchyma 			
gives out the important fibres that we obtain today in the form of jute and			
uh from the jute plant and the hemp plant okay 			
So these fibres which we use for making sack or for making			
even now a days uh jute cloth is attaining a lot of importance 			
All these can be obtained from our sclerenchyma fibres which			
on maturing have got certain stone cells or one word and			
these stone cells give a toughness to the cell and they end up 			
becoming the fibres of the plant 			
Thus the sclerenchyma cells are found in large numbers in certain			
type of plants like the coconut 			
The coconut palm then you have your jute uh tree or your			
hemp etcetra where fibres are obtained from these plants			
I shall tell you about these again we use for variety of uh 			
provisions like making of rope of choirs or even matresses coir			
matresses or then the latest is jute cloth 			
So this completes our uh one topic that is simple			
permanent tissues 			
These tissues have not uh have not totally lost their			
ability to divide			
That is if we want we can bunch their form they can still			
undergo cellular division and form new set of cells			
This is what distinguishes simple permanent tissues from			
complex permanent tissues			
They have not totally lost their ability to divide that means 			
when the cell is formed it grows in size but also it has a necessity 			
it can also divide and form another set of cells 			
What we have learnt is that only meristematic cells are capable of			
function cell doesn't it ?			
But in certain cases usually simple permanent cells can undergo			
 uh cell division if the need arises though not always 			
Then you have a large size of cell plant			
cells and that is the complex permanent tissues 			
These are the most important tissues of the plant because they			
perform the very vital functions like conducting of water and			
conducting of food materials 			
This cell the complex uh permanent tissue which 			
conduct water are known as your xylem cells 			
 Xylem cells 			
And the permanent permanent tissues which conduct food			
materials are known as your phloem cells 			
 Phloem cells 			
These are found in the innermost regions of the plant or 			
of the plant structure like the stem the root or the leaf of the tree 			
The inner most structure of these is form of these root			
structure the Xylem and the phloem 			
Why are they called as complex permanent tissues is because 			
the word complex is a very key word 			
If these cells once they are formed once a particular cell is			
formed it loses its ability to divide			
It can not divide again and form another xylem cell 			
It remains by itself and it goes on performing its function			
and after a period of time when it has finished its uh life life			
cycle life period it might die off			
Then a new xylem cell might come in its place 			
But this cell on its own will not give rise to a new set of cells			
Now both these uh cells that is xylem and phloem are found			
in the form of tube towards the whole length of the stem or the			
whole length of the root or the whole length of the leaf 			
They are perfectly arranged in such a way to form a tubular			
structure or tube like structure so that conduction of the material			
becomes much easier			
But even may be in the form of water based minerals or it			
might be food materials in the case of phloem 			
Okay xylem conduct water through out the plant body 			
and phloem conduct waste food material towards the plant body 			
Now if you want to see the individual structure of xylem and			
phloem 			
The xylem has got you have two sets of cells again in the			
xylem and they are called as tracheids and vessels 			
Okay so you have xylem tracheae and xylem vessels and			
both these are found in association with each other			
You will never find only a xylem tracheae or you will never find			
only a xylem vessel 			
And in the phloem you have two types of cells you have 			
sieve and companion cells 			
And one characteristic feature of the phloem cells is that at			
the top walls okay the top walls are not continous but they have			
got fine pores in them to form a mess like structure or matting like			
structure in between the two top walls the top wall structure in between two			
cell 			
And this fine mess like structure acts as a sieving place for			
all the materials food materials that passes along the wall 			
So only a certain type of food material can pass pass through the			
phloem tubes having a definite size 			
All the larger materials will not pass through the sieve 			
The food material can be easily accumulated by the rest uh 			
the leaf of the plant through the one word of plant 			
What is the difference between H and H two ?			
Difference between H and H two ?			
Raise your hands if you know 			
 name of student 			
No he was sitting in the ninth standard 			
Okay 			
What is the difference between H and H two ?			
Nobody ?			
One is uh 			
Yes yes			
H is the one atom of hydrogen and H two is the one			
molecule of hydrogen			
Yes			
That is this particular H stands for the atomic symbol of			
hydrogen while H two is the formula or molecular formula of			
 hygrogen noise 			
What is it H stands for ?			
 Atomic symbol while H two stands for			
 the molecular formula 			
 Atomic symbol 			
 The molecular formula 			
Okay what is the relative atomic mass of hydrogen ?			
Relative atomic mass raise your hand			
One point zero zero eight			
One point zero zero eight 			
 Eight 			
Okay			
Isotopes of hydrogen ?			
Isotopes of hydrogen ?			
No ?			
Rahul ?			
Molecules of hydrogen			
Stand up and say 			
Molecules noise of horn 			
Kiran ?			
 A few words 			
 A few words 			
Now when you put that one word one and one what does			
this means ?			
Which isotope is this indicate ?			
 Noise 			
What does this particular symbol indicate or this			
representation indicate ?			
Yes Savita ?			
It is uh			
It is ?			
The one word 			
 Noise 			
So what will one H one stand for ?			
 Procium 			
 Procium okay			
Now tell why do you guess or first tell me what is this			
subscript stand for and the superscript stand for ? Noise 			
Subscript stands for ?			
Atomic number			
Atomic number 			
Nupur subscript stand for what ?			
Mass number			
Mass number			
Mass number			
Atomic number			
Atomic number			
So okay what does this particular subscript stand for ?			
Mass number			
Mass number 			
Why are they written mass numbers here ?			
Or what will show the formula one or two words 			
 Because there is a difference there are different numbers			
of neutrons 			
Because there is difference in the number of 			
neutrons 			
 Neutrons 			
And neutrons or mass number means ? Noise 			
Mass number means ?			
Number of protons			
Number of 			
Protons 			
Number of protons plus number of neutrons 			
 Neutrons 			
Present in the			
The nucleus of an atom			
 The nucleus of an atom 			
 The nucleus of an atom 			
All right okay			
Then next we go to about the occurance of hydrogen 			
Hydrogen can occur in in which two states ?			
Hydrogen can occur in which two states ?			
Jivan ?			
We get the atom in the free state			
Give the example where where it is occuring in the free			
state			
In sun			
In ?			
Sun 			
Sun and ? noise and ?			
Atmosphere			
Atmosphere of 			
Earth			
Earth and 			
Sun 			
Sun okay			
Rakesh in the other state give me the examples ?			
Rocks and minerals 			
In the rocks and minerals			
See so hydrogen occurs in two different states in the			
free state and in the combined state			
In the free state it is specially present in the atomsphere of			
the sun and in the other stars of the universe			
And in the combined state it can be present in the rocks and			
minerals and what else ?			
Tissues 			
Tissues of ?			
Animals and plants			
Okay next is about the preparation of hydrogen 			
Now you can prepare hydrogen by two words 			
noise 			
There are some general methods of preparation of hydrogen isn't it			
 ?			
Give me some names you can prepar 			
prepare hydrogen from ?			
Sejal			
Cold water			
From cold water okay 			
Then ?			
Boiling water			
Boiling water and ?			
Alkali noise 			
Alkali 			
Alkali any more ?			
Any more ?			
 That's all 			
Teacher in water gas			
From that is found after the industrial or			
the commercial production 			
 Industrial or the commercial production 			
These all are mentioned here are the general methods of 			
preparation			
While these what you mention now were for gas 			
This industrial process of preparation of hydrogen okay sit			
down			
Now give me one example for preparation of hydrogen from cold			
water ?			
Yes Sachin ?			
Potassium calcium 			
What are they ?			
What are they ?			
 Potassium calcium 			
 Active metals 			
They are ?			
Active metals			
Active metals how do you know they are active metals ?			
Sameer ?			
They react violently 			
They react violently so ?			
They are active metals			
They react with uh cold water and produce uh 			
Okay they react I know but how do you come to know they are			
 active metals ?			
Yes Sheetal ?			
From the activity series of metals			
From the activity series of metals 			
They are present at the sit down they are present at the			
 ?			
Top 			
Top of the ?			
Series			
So those metals which are at the top of series in the			
active series are called as the active metals			
So active metals like potassium sodium and calcium react with			
 cold water to produce hydrogen 			
 Hydrogen 			
Okay now explain the process of reaction of potassium			
with cold water ?			
Replacement one word 			
How does potassium react with cold water ?			
 Noise 			
How does potassium react ? student name 			
How does potassium react with cold water ?			
When potassium ash is added to cold water what happens ?			
Ajit ?			
No do not know how they react ?			
Do you know the equation ?			
Do you know the equation or no ?			
The reactions ?			
No			
Potassium with water will give you what ?			
 One word 			
You are preparing what is that ?			
What are you preparing ?			
Hydrogen			
So one product is going to be ?			
Hydrogen 			
K O 			
Teacher 			
Three uh			
Okay so we were discussing about potassium			
 reacting with water			
 Potassium 			
One product isotope will be hydrogen hydrogen			
 Hydrogen 			
So what will be the other product ?			
K O H			
K O H that is what ?			
Potassium			
Potassium hydroxide			
Potassium hydroxide 			
 Hydroxide 			
Now tell me the process completely in detail 			
That is the whole process which you wrote in an eq			
 equation involved in it 			
Yes Hemant ?			
It is not used			
I want the process it is not used I know 			
But if you add it to water it will show some reaction			
The the reaction will be violent and and and 			
endo endothermic 			
Endothermic ?			
It is an endothermic Noise 			
What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic			
 ?			
What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic ?			
Teacher			
Teacher teacher 			
Come on come on hurry up 			
In the endothermic it is revolved and in exothermic it is			
evolved			
No noise 			
Anybody else ?			
Exothermic is reactions in which heat is evolved 			
Exothermic			
Alright that was right			
What about endothermic ?			
No heat is evolved ?			
Heat is			
Heat is absorbed 			
Do you follow or no ?			
So when potassium reacts with water what happens ?			
It reacts violently and it is an exothermic reaction			
What else any other point left ?			
Any other point left ?			
What happens to the heat that is evolved ?			
Ignites 			
It			
Ignites the hydrogen gas			
Yes it ignites the hydrogen gas that is formed 			
Next is what happens with sodium ?			
How does cold water react with sodium metal ?			
Tanuja ? Noise 			
Hurry up 			
Reaction with sodium is evolved uh with			
More thing is 			
And it reacts with one word and sod 			
 sodiumness forming slowly reacts with the 			
probably revolved above the water			
Ah and when it revolves in water what happens ?			
It noise 			
To obtain the noise 			
I am not asking that when it is revolving in water what			
happens ?			
Why is it revolving in water ?			
Because its 			
Reacting with water to give you hydrogen			
 hydrogen gas and 			
 Hydrogen 			
 A few words 			
In sodium hydroxide noise 			
The active metals like potassium sodium calcium react 			
One product is hydrogen because you are using it to prepare			
hydrogen only and the other is always the product found in hydroxide 			
If it is potassium it will be potassium hydroxide if it is			
sodium it will be sodium hydroxide if it is uh calcium it will be 			
calcium hydroxide 			
Alright sit down			
Now if you want to obtain a steady flow of hydrogen gas			
 from while preparing it from sodium metal what do you have to do to			
obtain a steady flow from the gas ?			
Of the gas ?			
Kiran ?			
Sodium metal is amalgamated 			
Is amalgamated means what is it done ?			
Amalgamated what is the meaning of the term amalgamated ?			
Thats one word 			
No that is the different term totally noise			
What does it do or what do you understand by amalgam or			
amalgamated ?			
Its an alloy			
Miss an alloy of metal with mercury			
Yes it is an alloy of a metal with mercury			
So you have to amalgamate sodium with mercury			
And what else do what else do you have			
to do ?			
That is the only thing you have to do teacher to			
obtain the steady flow of the gas 			
Savita ?			
 Teacher 			
Wrap it in a wire box 			
Wrap it in a wire box okay			
So you what will happen then you will get a steady flow			
of the hydrogen gas that is evolved 			
Then next we go to calcium 			
How does water reacts with calcium ?			
I already gave you the answer before itself 			
How does calcium react with water ?			
If you have listened to me carefully you will know what it is 			
 One word 			
The first thing we said about potassium 			
We said what ?			
The reaction is one word violent 			
rigorous and exotherm 			
 One word 			
After that we place sodium because it is less vigorous than			
 potassium okay			
And thirdly now we have to come at calcium 			
So now it will be ?			
Hydrogen potassium and sodium			
Draw back to both sodium and potassium 			
 Potassium 			
Alright now what is it left ?			
Or why cannot we use calcium in ?			
 Noise 			
Why cannot we use calcium 			
Why can't we use calcium in the production of hydrogen ?			
Hydrogen 			
Why cannot we use calcium in the production of hydrogen ?			
Minaz 			
Because it is an expensive method			
Because it is an expensive method 			
 Method 			
Okay now how do we collect the hydrogen that is formed in			
all these above cases ?			
By downward method			
How do we collect the hydrogen gas that is formed ?			
Rakesh ?			
By downward downward displacement			
of			
By downward displacement of water 			
Aftab tell me why do you have to collect it by downward			
displacement of water only ?			
 A few words 			
Why do we collect with by downward displacement of water 			
what is the reason ?			
Because it is slightly soluble in water			
Slightly soluble in slightly soluble in a			
Slightly soluble in water			
Slightly soluble in water and what else ?			
What is the other reasons ?			
And lighter than air 			
And lighter than air 			
 Air 			
So you collect it by the downward displacement of 			
water 			
 Water 			
Then next is about preparation of hydrogen from boiling			
water			
Which metals react with boiling water to give you hydrogen ?			
 noise 			
Amit which metals react with boiling water to give you			
hydrogen ?			
 A few words 			
No it's not so			
Magnesium			
Magnesium only magnesium zinc 			
Iron iron 			
Zinc and there is one more metal 			
Iron 			
Iron 			
Iron okay 			
So magnesium reacts with ?			
 One word 			
So these magnesium zinc and iron are ?			
Less active metals			
Less active metals than potassium sodium and calcium 			
They react with water now a bit differently than			
 what uh than how the sodium potossium and calcium were			
reacting			
What is the difference ?			
None ?			
The intention is to prepare hydrogen only or to be burnt			
hydrogen when the reactor is boiling water 			
But what is the difference between the other two process the			
other one word 			
Are you following the question or no ?			
No			
Both these metal or all these metals these three metals			
 the active metals potassium calcium and sodium are reacting with			
water to give you hydrogen and something else what is that ?			
The hydroxide of those metals right			
Here these metals magnesium zinc and iron which are less			
active than potassiun sodium and calcium are reacting with water to give			
you hydrogen but they are giving you some other product what is that ?			
Well we will be discussing today the lesson that			
I have already started			
Do you know the lesson that I am going to discuss to			
 today 			
Malefactor Malefactor			
Malefactor that's right that's right			
And I do hope that by now all of you might have read the lesson			
 and understood the contents of it too 			
Right ?			
The first question that we are going to raise today for discussion			
 is that do you justify the title of the story ?			
Do you justify the title of the story ?			
I mean you ?			
Would you ?			
 What's your opinion ?			
Sir the chapter raise the sir Denis is not not 			
 actually actually a criminal criminal but uh like			
 he uh does the he does uh he opens the			
screw unknowingly			
Right he doesn't know that it is really a crime 			
Actually he does it unknowingly 			
So what you mean that he is not a criminal one ?			
No he isn't			
Right 			
Yes please what do you have to say ?			
That the title Malefactor doesn'tjustify the uh			
 doesn't justify on Denis because he is not a			
criminal and he doesn't uh commit the act knowingly			
He just uh does it unknowingly and tells the judge also			
that he had done and doesn't hide anything like a a professional			
criminal			
Okay if we turn the pages of our text we will find that he			
knows he does know that unscrewing of the nuts may lead to the rail			
accident 			
If you see the line you will find he confesses that 			
we know that it may lead to the train accident that's why we don't			
unscrew all the nuts we unscrew only few 			
Sir he doesn't say that we know that accident will occur			
as a result so he says that we know that the nut holds the railway track			
Right			
Sir he says that nuts cannot cause an accident			
No not that one			
But he does he does know that if we unscrew all the nuts			
 it may lead to train accident causing the loss of life and			
property 			
He does know 			
What are the other clues by that you can justify the title ?			
You can't say that here whether he is a criminal or not			
 noise 			
Sir first thing he said that he was a very poor man			
Yes			
It was when that he said you can't find lead or nail 			
uh uh on the street or you have to buy that ah so he was			
 a very poor man			
So he drills hole into pluck out nut from the track			
 Ah 			
Right 			
Perhaps you would mean to say that while judging him as a			
criminal we must see his situation too 			
The circumstances he is pressed by 			
We find that he is such a poor man that he is not in a			
position to buy the other thing to use as sinker as he is			
pleading again and again that I do it I did unscrew the nuts only to			
 use them as sinkers 			
Perhaps his financial condition is not so that he may buy the 			
other thing or substitute of the nut 			
Isn't so ?			
Anything else that you have to say ?			
Yes ? noise 			
Anything ?			
You wanted to tell something ?			
No 			
Then what else you have to say ?			
Is there any other clue whereby you can prove that he is not a			
criminal ?			
The one thing that you have clarified is that it is the 			
demand of the circumstances or he is pressed by the circumstances that's			
 why he unscrewed the nuts			
Anything else ?			
The criminal was not an educated 			
He is not an educated one			
Educated man and even he doesn't know anything about the			
 track anything that it can cause accident by plucking out of the lines			
Right 			
May be accepted 			
Sir lot of whole society are unscrewing the nut but 			
but an individual cannot be termed say that he has unscrewed the nut			
 so rules of the society is also there			
 So 			
Right whole society means the gentry 			
There is not only the Denis alone 			
when but other people of the community are also doing the			
same thing 			
Sir he doesn't hide the name of anyone but he tells two or			
three names more to the judge			
Right			
This shows that he was not a criminal 			
But one thing is there suppose if the majority of the			
people are doing the same thing you how can you say that 			
it's not a crime ?			
Can you ?			
If majority of the people do the same work does it means			
uh file any logic or thereby can you say that yes it is not a crime			
because the large number of people are doing so 			
So how can we accept this one that because not only Denis but other			
fellows are also doing 			
Other members of the community are also doing that's why			
 it's not a very serious crime 			
It is a 			
Sir it is a crime 			
It is a ?			
Crime 			
If it is a crime then you might be justifying the punishment			
too given to him			
Yes sir 			
Denis does qualify as a criminal with one more reason because			
 the law says that if the committer does the crime knowingly			
And so he did it do it knowingly 			
Right			
It was stated in the law panel code one zero eight 			
Means the gravity of the punishment should also take care			
of whether something is done knowingly 			
What is the intention of the person doing a particular offence			
 committing a crime intention of the mind should also be uh			
taken care of 			
So was there any intention like that one ?			
No 			
Was there any bad intention ?			
No sir			
No 			
So we can say if there was no any bad intention like rail			
accident or other things like then he must not be given that			
much severe punishment 			
He should not be levelled as a criminal 			
Why ?			
Because he did it without knowing 			
So if we sum up the things we can say first of all that it			
is the circumstances it is his financial condition that made him			
to do commit the crime 			
Second thing is that his intention is not bad			
He is doing it unknowingly 			
There is no any bad intention of causing the rail accident			
 causing the loss of life and property no intention			
Anything else ?			
On the ground of that you can say that he doesn't deserve that much			
severe punishment Noise 			
Is there any more points ?			
Can you recollect ?			
Yes can you recollect ? noise 			
Can you ?			
No 			
No 			
Anybody else in the class who has any more points 			
thereby who can say that the title of the story Malefactor is not			
appropriate one ?			
Yes ?			
The society around him made the circumstances that			
they made him to do that 			
But the role and role and of the society 			
That is the ?			
The whole world of the crime world the they 			
depend on society around us 			
How the society is responsible ?			
Because he says that they the wise men and the			
uh men of the village do the same work 			
Right 			
It means that from the childhood he is made to do the			
same thing 			
Now that we have already taken that is more number of the			
people do the same thing that is an offence			
We cannot say that it is not an offence 			
Sit down please sit down 			
Yes anything else ? noise 			
So in your view the title of the story is not appropriate one			
 ?			
No sir			
Can you think of can you substitute any other appropriate			
title to the story ?			
If this one is not appropriate can we give any			
appropriate title to the story ?			
Can you think of any new title to the story ?			
Sir poverty is great crime 			
Poverty create crime 			
Poverty ?			
Create crime 			
Poverty creates crime and why only poverty ignorance is			
also with that or both are coincided very often ?			
Sir sir innocent criminal 			
Innocent criminal 			
Then the title suggested is suggested one is Innocent			
Criminal 			
What is your re reaction to it ?			
Sir criminal criminal cannot be			
called innocent no 			
The criminal cannot be called called 			
innocent then he is a criminal sir but sir he is a			
 Then 			
Sir but sir he is innocent 			
Sir he is little bit innocent 			
Yes sit down 			
Okay that a criminal cannot be but you know that one			
of the merit of the title is to create interest in the story too 			
If it is an innocent criminal then perhaps you will be			
interested to learn that how an innocent man became a criminal 			
It may create some interest too 			
Can you think of similar title ?			
On the same line can you find any better one ?			
Okay if not according to you what type of punishment does he			
deserve ? noises 			
In case 			
 A few words 			
In case he is not a criminal one but he has done			
something wrong you know 			
Knowingly unknowingly whatever is there but he has done			
something wrong and he has been caught red handed too 			
What type of punishment would you like to accord to him ?			
Yes ?			
He has to reveal the plan causing the liability that 			
that they are but not the individual particular in society to be taught			
as has given me a one word to seek a as if they had			
deliberately done then a few words noise 			
 Then 			
Then one thing perhaps you want to say that we will take			
this one as a feedback and educate the society			
Tell the people that this is something very wrong they			
must not do 			
He must be instructed like that one and should be released or			
any other punishment ?			
He should be 			
Yes please ?			
He should be let off with a warning or at the most he should			
be imprison for one or two months 			
He should be given either the warning or ?			
Imprisonment at the most for one or two months not too			
much 			
Right 			
Not more than one or two months 			
Anything else ?			
Vishal ?			
You know the what is the target what is the aim of the			
punishment ?			
Just to bring improvement and check the further crime 			
Just to bring the improvement as well as to check the further			
crime too 			
So one is that he should be given either a very light			
punishment one or two months imprisonment with some warning			
Another one is suggesting that the fellow should be left 			
and government or the agency should take it as a feedback and tell			
or educate the other people regarding the offence that they should			
not do it 			
Right ?			
They should be told they should be uh educated that it			
is something wrong very wrong it may lead to severe punishment and they			
should not do 			
Right mass awakening			
Anything else ?			
Anything else in the capacity of a magistrate that you would			
like to ?			
Sir the presence of that many people in the village as			
petty according to famous man also do uh make that uh net so he wants			
more nut in that			
So it's mass awareness is needed to educate all the			
village and warn them that they had to do no more plucking of the nut			
from track site			
Right right I do agree 			
I do agree with you that such an ingnorant man such a			
 simple honest man should not be given a very severe punishment			
Atleast one or two chances must be given to him to improve himself			
And the other members of the community should also be 			
shown that this is something punishable and they must leave it 			
I think that such honest fellows if given the chance they will			
improve they will leave such crimes 			
They will realise the gravity of the crime 			
Understood ?			
You know till the very end Denis doesn't understand that			
what for he is being sent to prison 			
Till the very end he doesn't understand that what for he is being			
sent to the prison 			
Right ?			
Why ?			
He is punished he is uh given a very severe punishment			
 but till the very end he doesn't know that what is his crime 			
He doesn't know he couldn't understand it			
Why ?			
Or if I repeat the question like that one what are the			
crimes in his eyes ?			
According to him what are the crimes ?			
He thinks that 			
He thinks that unscrewing a nut from the rail track is			
not a crime at all 			
Then what are the crimes in his eyes ?			
Yes ?			
That his brother was not paying the tax 			
He thinks that 			
His brother was not paying the tax			
And he is being sent to for his brother's crime			
 right 			
He thinks that those who fight they must be punished and he hasn't			
 fought with anyone that's why he doesn't deserve 			
Right 			
Yes ?			
Denis uh says stealing			
Stealing is punishable 			
So don't you think that he has stolen a nut ?			
 Noise 			
Don't you think ?			
 Noise 			
He has done unknowingly 			
He did it unknowingly 			
Right 			
He is not stealing the tax 			
He			
Not stealing tax			
 Accha one who doesn't pay the taxes he			
deserves the punishment 			
Right ?			
Sir coming for judgement			
What ?			
Sir there is one thing that he never a few words 			
Please sit down 			
Yes ?			
So I think stealing non-payment of the taxes and he			
thinks that he has not stolen anything 			
He has not fought with anyone and he has paid his taxes			
So he doesn't deserve the punishment punishment			
Understood ?			
 That's why till the very end he couldn't convince himself			
 that he is a criminal 			
Though he was found criminal in the eyes of the law but he			
couldn't convince himself that he is a criminal 			
Okay 			
So is there any confusion regarding the story ?			
 Punishment 			
No sir 			
Or is there any other questions that you've got in			
your mind ?			
Anyone any sort of the questions or doubts ? 			
Good morning children 			
Today we are going to do the lesson The Missing Mail			
 			
What is the name of the lesson ?			
 The missing mail 			
 The missing mail 			
Can you understand anything about the title of the story ?			
Missing mail 			
What do you understand by that ?			
What is missing mail ?			
Mail means what ? Yes ?			
Train alright 			
What is the other meaning of mail ?			
Yes ?			
 Inaudible 			
Letter very good 			
Mail you know mail saying they say which carries the			
mail van and all that which carries letters to the the station			
So here The missing mail means the letter that			
has not been delivered 			
Are you able to follow this ?			
The letter that has not been delivered 			
And now you tell me the personalities of the post man is			
going to play a part isn't it ?			
If the post man is very rude he doesn't listen to you he			
throws your letters at that time how do you feel about him ?			
He is a bit rude impolite doesn't talk to you nicely 			
and the other one who talks to you in a very nice manner			
Do you find any difference between these two persons ?			
Ah Devyani can you tell ?			
Teacher we can't with a person who is not polite and uh			
Yes yes 			
If the person is very courteous polite then we feel like			
talking to him 			
If he is rather very rude and arrogant that time you don't feel			
like talking to the person 			
Similarly when you go to a doctor a doctor who listens to your			
suffering your troubles and all that with a patient hearing he gives			
you and he talks to you in a very nice manner half of your troubles			
are over isn't it ?			
And suppose a doctor is there he talks to you in a very bad			
manner 			
I mean he doesn't talk to you much he doesn't inquire much			
about your suffering and all that how do you feel ?			
Which doctor are you going to visit frequently ?			
The one who is going to talk to you in a very nice manner			
 listens to you and pays attention to what is 			
what are your problems and he tries to find a solution to			
that 			
So here in the present lesson present story we are			
going to come across Thanappa the postman of the village and let us see			
 how he deals with the people there how much he has I mean he			
has uh he has identified himself with the people living in this village			
Each and everyone he knows by their names and he identifies			
himself with their troubles sufferings and everything and gives			
them advice when it is required 			
Now the story goes like this 			
All of you look into your book The teacher reads 			
Though his beat covered Vinayak Mudali Street and it's			
 four parallel roads it took him nearly six hours before he			
finished his round and returned to the head office in Market Road to			
deliver accounts 			
He allowed himself to get mixed up with the fortunes of the			
persons to whom he was carrying letters 			
At Number Thirteen Kabir Street lived the man who had			
come halfway up the road to ask for a letter for so many years now			
Thanappa had been had seen him as a			
youngster and had watched him day by day greying on the pyol			
 sitting there and hoping for a big prize to come his way			
 through solving crossword puzzles 			
 No prize yet he announced to him everyday 			
 But don't be disheartened 			
 Your interest has been delayed this month somehow			
 he said to another 			
 Your son at Hyderabad has written again madam			
How many children has he now ? The teacher			
explains 			
Could you follow a little bit of this postman named Thanappa			
 ?			
Now let us see though his beat covered Vinayak Mudali Street			
The name of the street in which he had to deliver the letters			
to the various people 			
So here it took him nearly six hours only one street 			
 living the people living there he had to deliver the letters but			
how many hours did it take for him ?			
 Six hours 			
 Six hours to deliver the letters 			
Can you tell me what he does in those six hours ?			
Why so much time he is taking ?			
Why does he take so much time ?			
Why ?			
What is the matter with him he can just throw the letter and			
come back but what does he do while delivering the letters ?			
Dhanya ?			
Teacher he A few words 			
Yes he inquires about their welfare he ask them about			
their problems and all that and he tries to find a solution to their 			
problems 			
 That's why the work which is to be finished within one			
hour is taking him six hours to complete 			
So here he allowed himself to get mixed up with the			
fortunes of the persons 			
What do you understand by the phrase get mixed up			
with ?			
 What's the meaning of this phrase ?			
Kanchan can you tell the meaning ?			
 A few words 			
No what does he do ?			
Means uh what meaning are you getting by that ?			
With the fortunes of the persons to whom he was carrying			
letters 			
What do you mean by that ?			
He mixed up with			
 He's very what is it ?			
He mixed up with the villagers			
Means he has got intimate contact with them 			
He knows very well what are the problems and that's 			
why if anybody is hoping for a money order or anybody is 			
wants a prize or anybody anybody wants a suitable match for his daughter			
Like that he knows each and everyone's problems and he			
identifies himself with all their uh whatever they want with all all			
their things is identifying and that's why the writer says that			
 he mixed up with the fortunes of the people 			
And now the particular man whom he is talking now is about			
living in Thirteen Kabir Street and this man Thanappa had been			
seeing right as a child 			
He knew him and this man today is an old man who is now			
having a marriageable age daughter who is to get married and			
now this man is eagerly trying for a match to his daughter 			
So here he says the man was sitting on a pyol 			
 Pyol means a carridor in front of the house			
 and this man is a little bit inactive you can say throughout			
the day he will be sitting there and trying to solve the crossword			
puzzle 			
What is a crossword puzzle ?			
Have you seen it ?			
Do you ever tried to solve it ?			
You get in Sunday magazines and all that magazine sections you			
are having everyday in The Hindustan Times and			
 Statesman in the last page you have it isn't it ?			
So this man is very busy trying to solve it but up till			
now he was not successful and he could not get a prize 			
What does Thanappa say to him ?			
He says no prize yet 			
Mallika ?			
That way when he passes the postman passes through that way 			
the man eagerly looks up at him why ?			
Because he is expecting a prize 			
He wishes that Thanappa should intimate him that he had won			
the crossword puzzle for that week or month and he is going to get a			
prize 			
But Thanappa says No prize yet 			
 You haven't won a prize 			
But don't be disheartened 			
Disheartened means Don't be disappointed 			
Yes student name 			
Disappointed			
Yes very good 			
Disheartened means Don't lose heart don't lose			
courage have the will power try try like that and one day you			
are going to be successful 			
 Your interest has been delayed this month somehow 			
he said to another 			
Now another first he has gone to another house to deliver a letter			
 and there the man is expecting some interest and he consoles him			
that his interest has been delayed a little bit but it is going to be			
added to the and soon he is going to receive it 			
And then to the third one he says Your son at			
Hyderabad has written again madam how many children has he now			
 ?			
He says to another lady Your son has written a letter			
from Hyderabad and now he enquires about your welfare 			
 The teacher reads 			
 I did not know that you had applied for this 			
Madras job you haven't cared to tell me!			
It doesn't matter 			
When I bring you your appointment order you must feed			
 feed me with coconut payasam 			
 The teacher explains 			
And now here is another person who had applied for an			
interview 			
He informed him that he had got selected and he has got			
the appointment order to him and he says you have to give me feast 			
because I've brought good news for you 			
So like that each and every person very intimately he			
knows what are their problems and he finds the solutions and through			
the letters which he is delivering he expects that they are getting			
someting good 			
Something good is going to happen to them The teacher			
reads 			
And at each of their places he stops for nearly half an			
hour especially if anyone received money order he just settle			
down quite nicely with his bags and bundles spread about him and			
would not rise till he gathered an idea of how and where every			
 rupee was going The teacher explains 			
You see the concern of this postman 			
He talks to the person if a person gets a money order he			
does not quickly deliver the money and get it signed the form 			
and leave the place 			
He would sit down along with his bag and baggage he will			
talk to the person enquires him about the expenditure which is going			
to do with that money and he fears that ensures that each 			
rupee is going to be spent in a fruitful way 			
It is not being wasted 			
Are you able to follow this point all of you ?			
How intimately how much personal interest he is taking in the			
affairs of each and everyone and how much he is concerned about the			
expenditure of that person the way how he is going to spend the money 			
which he had delivered just now through money order 			
Whether it is being done the expenditure in a fruitful manner 			
or it is going to be a waste that he finds out from that person 			
and gets satisfaction only when he sees that it is spent in the right			
manner The teacher reads 			
If it was a hot day he sometimes asked for a tumbler of			
buttermilk The teacher explains 			
When it is very hot that time he would ask for a glass			
of buttermilk The teacher reads and sat down to enjoy it 			
Everybody liked him on his beat 			
He was a part and parcel of their existence their hopes 			
aspirations and activities The teacher explains 			
So the people living in that particular village this			
postman Thanappa is just like a member of their family 			
Are you able to understand ?			
Why ?			
Because unlike the other postman of today nowadays what do			
you find a very rude they don't bother about what you have			
received 			
Whether it is a bad news or good news nobody bothers about it			
But here he would go and sit with them talk with them			
 listen to their problems and assured them and give them advice			
 regarding what is to be done 			
So what type of a postman is Thanappa ?			
A very caring affectionate kind polite type of man			
Shall I continue sir ? Addressed to someone who is			
recording the teacher's lesson 			
Now look here The teacher reads 			
Of all his contacts the one with which he was most intimately			
bound up was Number Ten Vinayak Mudali Street 			
Ramanujam was a senior clerk in the Revenue Division Office			
 and Thanappa had carried letters to that address for over a			
generation now The teacher explains 			
And now the pa particular 			
person who is going to be the hero of our story is Mr Ramanujam			
Where is he working ?			
He is working as clerk			
He is working 			
Kanchan ?			
He is working as senior clerk			
Yes he is a senior clerk in the Revenue Office 			
Sit down please 			
And now The teacher reads 			
His earliest association with Ramanujam was years and			
years ago 			
 Ramanujam's wife was away in the village 			
A card arrived for Ramanujam 			
Thanappa as was his custom glanced to it at the			
sorting table itself and the moment he was ready to start out went			
straight to Vinayak Mudali Street though in the ordinary course 			
over hundred and fifty addresses preceded it 			
He went straight to Ramanujam's house knocked on the			
door and shouted postman sir postman 			
When Ramanujam opened it he said Give me a handful			
of sugar before I give you this card 			
Happy father !			
After all these years of prayers !			
Don't complain that it is a daughter 			
Daughters are God's gifts you know ...			
Kamakshi - lovely name ! The teacher explains 			
And now we find he is associating himself with the 			
happiness of Ramanujam 			
Ramanujam is blessed with a daughter and Thanappa had come			
to deliver the news that he has become a father 			
A daughter has been born to him and he assured him that 			
 dau daughter is born so he should not			
feel sad because according to the our Hindu custom people			
are not happy when a girl is born in the family because all that			
trouble to get her married the large sum of dowry that is to be			
paid 			
Dowry you know what is it ? 			
Okay please be seated 			
Kindly sit down 			
 Haan I know			
I know 			
Dipti will you be sitting here ?			
Not I			
Okay now you take this seat 			
That is not better			
That is not good			
Better you have your seat here 			
No I will not sit 			
Close the door One or two words 			
Shakil don't play with handkerchief 			
Okay what I intend to do today yesterday whatever I have taught you			
regarding magnet that we will begin today once again 			
Instead of giving class work to you today I will repeat the same			
 thing 			
Okay let us start with magnetism			
What is magnetism ?			
Ravi ?			
What is magnetism ?			
Magnetism is uh magnets attract			
Magnet attracts attracting pieces of iron is called			
magnetism			
Ajay ?			
So the magnet is called as a substance which attracts uh			
which has the quality of attracting other substances to it 			
Other substances do you mean non-magnetic also ?			
Iron is one or two words 			
Who attracts iron nickel cobalt ?			
Magnet 			
Magnet			
So this force of attraction of magnet towards magnetic			
substances is called magnetism or magnetic force 			
So we begin with magnetism 			
What are the properties of a magnet ?			
Avinash ?			
Properties of a magnet 			
Yes Avinash I am talking to you 			
Uhm don't raise your hands uhm ?			
Magnet attracts iron			
Magnet always attracts iron and also magnetic substance is			
called load-stone nickel cobalt and some varieties of steel 			
What is the second property Vikas ?			
A freely suspended magnet always comes to rest pointing north			
direction			
What is a freely suspended magnet ?			
Subhash Subhash ?			
 What what do you mean by freely			
suspended ?			
Mahesh ?			
The magnet is tied to a string and is left to suspend			
We will have to take a stand tie it with a thread and 			
hang it and just move it 			
It will go on moving go on rotating for some time and after that			
 it will come to rest that is always the same direction called north			
and south 			
Now this north pole of the magnet is actually the south pole of the			
 earth			
The south pole of the magnet is actually the north pole of the			
earth			
Can you tell me why ?			
Ranjana ?			
 Why why are they different ?			
Because unbalanced pole of the suspended and right pole of			
the 			
But we have only one magnet here 			
We are talking about one magnet 			
Uhm Harish ?			
 I'm telling south pole of the earth is attracting 			
north pole of the magnet that is the geographical south is attracting 			
magnetic north pole 			
And am I talking about two magnets or one magnet ?			
One magnet 			
Yes Divya ?			
You are talking about one magnet			
Only one magnet Jayanti ?			
You are talking about two magnets			
Which is the other magnet ?			
Earth is the other magnet			
Yes our earth is the collection of magnetic substance 			
Our earth also behaves like a magnet			
Therefore what is actually real north pole is the earth's			
 south pole and what is actually 			
I am sorry			
What is actually the north pole of the earth that is the magnetic			
south pole and what is in reality the north pole of the earth that is the			
south pole of the magnet 			
Okay let us go to the third property of magnet			
Kavya ?			
Third property of a magnet 			
Any property that you know 			
Roopa ?			
Like poles repel each other			
Like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each			
other			
Naveen what do you mean by like poles ?			
Please be seated 			
What do you mean by like poles ?			
What is a pole ?			
Sachin ?			
What is a pole ?			
End of a magnet which attracts more more power			
than 			
Miss miss the end of the magnet is uh attracts the maximum			
 it has maximum uh			
Power of attraction that is called a pole 			
 A pole 			
Rather you can say that pole is a place of maximum attraction			
Don't say end 			
The place in a magnet which has maximum power of attraction that is			
called a pole 			
How many poles are there Shruti ?			
There are two poles			
Two poles are there			
Mohit what are they ?			
North pole and south pole			
North pole and south pole 			
So there are two poles in a magnet			
But when we bring two magnets together how do they behave ?			
Tripti ?			
When we bring two magnets together how do they behave ?			
They attract each other 			
How ?			
How do they attract each other Shilpa ?			
They A few words 			
Okay anybody else ?			
Yes ?			
Girish ?			
Girish you try 			
How do two magnets behave when we bring them together ?			
Divya ?			
Uhm			
Likely poles repel and			
Yes when we bring them together we will always find that			
north and north will repel and south of one magnet will attract the north			
pole of the other 			
So this is how they behave on coming together 			
Then next property of a magnet 			
Yes Ajay ?			
The magnet is having maximum attraction at its poles			
The magnetic attraction is greatest at its two poles and			
is lesser in the middle 			
Have you ever heard about magnetic field ?			
Yes ma'am 			
 What's just like ordinary playground or a field			
Have you heard of magnetic field ?			
Mahesh what is that ?			
Earth is a magnet			
Earth is a magnet 			
So whole earth is a field ?			
No 			
Field of magnet ?			
Anybody else ?			
Why don't you try ?			
Uhm 			
Please sit down 			
Because the earth behaves like a magnet			
Because the earth behaves like a magnet			
Ranjana ?			
The two ends of a magnet when uh rest against and when the			
object enters the magnetic field it gets attracted to that			
It gets attracted to that 			
So we can define magnetic field is that region upto which a magnet			
can affect or can exert its power of attraction on the object 			
And that field is again limited one			
It can't extend to a very long distance			
That area upto which a magnet can exert its attraction towards			
the magnetic substance that is called magnetic field 			
A smaller magnet has a small magnetic field a huge magnet will			
have a bigger magnetic field 			
Similarly earth also has a magnetic field 			
Next property of magnet which we have not discussed so far ?			
Yes Sanjeevani ?			
Any other property ?			
Deepti ?			
Magnet is called a loadstone			
Loadstone is magnetic substance 			
And magnets are basically made up of loadstone only 			
That is not the property 			
Yes Asha ?			
In the one or two words in a magnet			
Yes why a bar of iron and a bar magnet they behave in a			
different manner ?			
Why an iron bar is unable to attract another piece of iron ?			
If we just see the internal structure of a magnet that is a			
bar magnet and a bar of iron we do find there is a difference			
Why there is a difference ?			
Because of molecules 			
The arrangement of molecules in a bar magnet and a bar of iron			
they are totally different 			
In case of ir bar ir bar of			
iron what do you find ?			
What change do you find in bar of iron and bar magnet ?			
 A few words 			
Arrange in what ?			
Arrange in what fashion ?			
 A few words 			
Uh that boy Pratap ?			
Pratap is not there ?			
Yes Avinash you try 			
Please sit down 			
What about the pattern of arrangement of molecules in both the			
things ?			
In iron the molecules are not arranged uh in proper			
manner uh in magnet it's it is arranged 			
arranged in proper manner			
What do you mean by that proper manner ?			
 That's north uh north uh north north of			
Santosh don't play with it 			
Okay let us try to analyse 			
In case of bar of iron the molecules are arranged in a 			
any manner they like that is hap-hazard arrangement or zig-zag			
arrangement 			
But in case of bar magnet the same molecules are arranged in a			
line in a line or in a row and that too with all their north poles			
facing one side and south poles facing the other side			
Therefore we find maximum attraction on one side of the			
magnet due to all north facing domains are on one side all south facing			
domains are on the other side 			
Now what are these domains ?			
These domains are nothing but the other name for the molecules			
Why a magnet gains the property of attraction ?			
This is because of a specific arrangement of its domains or			
molecules in a particular fashion			
They are all arranged in a row that attributes or that gives the			
property of attraction to a magnet whereas a bar of iron lacks it 			
Now if by some force or some artificial means if we can arrange			
those molecules can a bar of iron be changed into a magnet ?			
Mohit ?			
Can we change a bar of iron into a magnet by making the			
molecular arrangement ?			
By making it same			
Same how ?			
How can we do so ?			
By rubbing by rubbing 			
By rubbing 			
How this rubbing should be done ?			
Santosh you can try ?			
Santosh how can we rub a magnet ?			
A bar of iron with a magnet and get get an another magnet ?			
Rub straight			
What do you mean by straight ?			
Triveni ?			
We should rub in the same direction			
No we should begin with one pole and start rubbing the magnet			
 and then again lift it and again bring the same pole again start			
rubbing it and lifting so by repeated rubbing and lifting the magnet			
 we can also convert a piece of blade or a bar of iron into a 			
magnet 			
What do you call this kind of magnet ?			
A permanent magnet or a temporary magnet ?			
Please be seated 			
What do you call this kind of magnet you have made by rubbing ?			
Prabhakar ?			
Yes Hemant you try ?			
Temporary			
We call it a temporary magnet 			
Abhay what do you mean by temporary magnet ?			
A temporary magnet is a magnet which uh loses its			
property after sometime but the moment uh			
Gradually lose their arrangement power or they are 			
get again the same zig-zag they get arranged in the zig-zag manner and			
they lose it 			
What are permanent magnets ?			
What are permanent magnets Sachin ?			
They do not lose 			
They do not lose			
They also lose their property but after a very very			
long period of time			
Yes Harish ?			
 A few words 			
Permanent magnets are magnets which lose the the			
power after many years and uh like they 			
Okay permanent magnets are those which lose their			
power after a long period of time 			
Have you heard about electro-magnets ?			
Yes			
Yes			
What are electro-magnets ?			
How can we make electro-magnets ?			
Jayanthi ?			
Electro-magnet is passed through electricity 			
Yes if we take any metallic wire and some how pass			
electricity through it by coiling around an electric wire all over			
it we find that same ordinary piece of metal gains the property			
of attraction and it starts attracting pieces of iron			
That is when we pass electric current through a piece of the			
metal it becomes a magnet and such magnets are referred to as 			
electro-magnets			
Yes Harish ?			
Generally we make electro-magnets with the instrument of			
iron			
Generally we make electro-magnets with the help of iron 			
by coiling copper wire on iron			
Formulate the electro or uh the 			
That is if we wrap alumin wire on aluminium yes that			
can also be converted into electro-magnet 			
Can you just yes Ranjana ?			
Electro magnet is one which a few words 			
Yes you are you are right but this this kind of			
electro-magnet we can convert big big pieces into magnet for our 			
quick purpose 			
But in case of rubbing you have to have very big magnet and			
again rubbing will take a very very long time and it it is			
possible only with the help of small piece of blade or a safety pin or a 			
small object 			
But when we want to make big magnet electro-magnets are used			
 in many other places			
So that is the best method though it is again a temporary			
The moment we switch off electric current again the same			
piece of iron becomes an ordinary thing 			
No more a magnet			
Miss can we make uh other metal from the one or two			
words 			
No no we can't 			
Only iron we can rub and convert it into temporary magnet 			
Now what are the uses of magnet ?			
What are the uses of magnet in our daily or day-to-day life ?			
Vikas ?			
Magnets are used in the boxes and uh electric current			
In pencil boxes for what purpose ?			
For 			
Yes for closing the box 			
We need not put much of effort just leave it because of the			
attraction it get tightly closed			
Yes Divya ?			
In door			
In 			
Door			
Door			
They are also used as door closers automatic door closers			
You leave the door because of attraction yes because			
of attraction the door gets closed			
In refrigerator also you leave it it gets stuck to it			
because of the magnetic force 			
Ravi ?			
In the dia diaphragm			
Diaphragm of a speaker and in motors 			
Next Santosh ?			
 A few words 			
Speak loudly 			
It is used by navigators in order to know the direction and			
for that matter they use a special type of magnet magnetic needle or			
magnetised needle that is fitted in a watch like thing we call it a			
compass 			
With the help of this compass needle they can come to know the			
direction in which they are moving			
So they help the navigators to know the direction in which			
they are sailing or moving 			
Ranjana ?			
In iron factories			
Yes in iron factories where lot of scrape iron is produced			
due to cutting or due to sawing of the bars 			
That scrape iron can again be melt melted and re-used			
therefore to pick up that scrape iron from the land or from the soil or			
from the broken pieces we make use of cranes fitted with the magnet			
which can go on collecting this scrape iron 			
Mahesh ?			
Girish ?			
Magnet is used in referigerator			
They are used in refrigerators I have told			
Kavya ?			
In generators			
In generators for what ?			
Miss miss 			
Let her answer			
Yes for generating what ?			
Electricity 			
Have you read it somewhere that magnets are used in			
generating electricity 			
Yes Kavya ?			
Have you read it somewhere ?			
I don't think anywhere we are using magnets to generate			
electricity 			
Ravi ?			
What do you say ?			
 A few words 			
Where ?			
In generator 			
That is where ?			
In the middle of copper wire 			
That day also he has told us that in the middle of the			
copper wire we put a magnet			
Then ?			
 A few words 			
By the copper wire and thats how it is transmitted 			
So we are generating electricity but we are unable to tell			
where and how ?			
You must know where and how it is being generated 			
Now today we are going to start the new topic 			
 The laws of return laws of return 			
Now already you have studied regarding the consumption topic 			
There you have studied regarding the behaviour of a consumer 			
How a consumer is reacting towards the prices in the law of demand			
You have studied that when the price increases the quantity			
demanded decreases and when price fall the quantity demand is 			
increased 			
Now here you have studied the behaviour of a consumer that			
how the consumer always tries to maximise his satisfaction 			
Now under the laws of return we are going to study the behaviour			
of a producer 			
That how the producer is trying to find out the relationship			
between the input and output and how this input-output relationship is			
 useful for determining his cost of production 			
Because his returns depends upon the cost of production 			
So under this now laws of return we have to			
study three different types of laws the law of increasing			
return diminishing return constant return and we have also to			
study the returns to state 			
But before we start with the law of increasing return			
 or law of variable proportion we have to			
be very clear regarding these certain concepts 			
So the first concept regarding which we have to be clear that			
is the production function production function 			
Production function now you can write on this production			
function Begins to dictate 			
According to Professor Lepski Production function is			
 production function is a technological relation is a			
technological relation showing for given state of technology 			
showing for given state of technology cough 			
This explains cough how much can be produced 			
how much can be produced with given amount of input with 			
given amount of input 			
 The functional relationship the functional			
relationship with the physical input and physical output 			
is known as production function is known as production			
function ends to dictate 			
It can be written in the form of equation it can be written in			
the form of equation as Quantity is equal to F 			
A B C D quantity equal to F A B C D 			
Here quantity B B work begin Q means quantity			
 F means factors of production A B C D B B work end			
 different factors of production A B C D different factors of 			
production Begins to dictates 			
This equation shows cough this equation shows 			
quantity produced depends on factors of production 			
respectively 			
This equation shows quantity produced depends on 			
factors of production respectively 			
Production function production function expresses the			
relationship production function expresses the relationship 			
between quantity of output quantity of output and quantities			
of various inputs and quantities of various inputs ends to			
dictate written			
Now in this production function what do you come to know 			
that what is production function ?			
It is a type of technological relationship which is existing			
between the input and output			
Now do you know what is the meaning of input and what is the			
meaning of output ?			
What is the meaning of input ?			
Yes ?			
Yes answer me 			
 It's alright it's a new topic but you must come			
forward 			
Now for the production of commodity what do you need ?			
Raw materials			
Raw materials so all these raw materials are input 			
This factors of production as land labour capital raw materials			
all these are the input 			
Now there supposingly there are two labourers and they are			
producing ten chairs 			
Now what is the relationship between this ?			
Raw material also they are using			
Along with that now what you will say ?			
That making use of all these two labourers they are able to produce			
the ten chairs in a day			
So this is the production function that when we employ the two			
labourers they are producing ten chairs 			
When we employ the third labourer the production function will 			
change because they will be producing now more number of chairs 			
So what is production function ?			
It is simply a relationship between the inputs and outputs			
Input is here the factors of production or the amount of the			
goods which we are using for the production of other commodities and			
output is the commodity which you are able to produce after making use of			
the input 			
And production function is giving you the relationship between the			
input and output 			
Thereby having this much of factors of production how much			
commodity we can produce			
So to that we are calling it as a input and output relationship			
 Begins to dictate 			
Then further two things must be noted two things must be			
noted in respect of in respect of production function 			
First production must be considered with			
reference to a particular period of time production must be considered			
 with reference to particular period of time 			
Written ?			
Second 			
Production technology should not change production			
technology should not change during that period 			
Production technology should not change during that			
period 			
Because when technology changes because when			
technology changes production function also gets changed when			
technology changes production function also gets changed 			
ends to dictate 			
Now these are the two things which we have to keep in mind			
regarding the production function that it should be related to a			
particular period of time and during that period our technology should			
not be changed 			
Because if the technology will change then our same production			
function relationship will not be there 			
Why ?			
Because with technology advancement when the technology changes 			
new input output relation come 			
So then our that production function cannot exist 			
So when we are studying it for a particular period of time			
during that period it is essential that the technology should not change			
As accordingly firstly the clothes are being produced with the help			
of handloom device 			
Now production was less and after that some period			
new technology has come and now we may start producing the cloth with			
the help of powerloom you can say 			
So naturally input output relation will change and			
production function will also change 			
Then Begins to dictate in economic theory two			
types of production function are there 			
In economic theory two types of production function are there			
First when some input when some input are			
kept constant when some input are kept constant and other is			
changed and other are changed ends to dictate 			
Written now this type of production function will be			
available in the short period 			
Now I had explained to you already the concept of short period 			
market period and long period 			
From the adjustment of the supply point of view 			
Now can you tell me now what is short period ?			
Now again you have to go back			
 It's very bad 			
What is short period ?			
During the short period the supply can be input to the			
Yes 			
Short periods are that period in which we can ad			
 adjust the supply to a limited absence only by			
taking the variable factors of production 			
I told you there are two types of factors of production 			
Fixed factors of production and variable factors of production			
So in the short period we are keeping the fixed factor as a			
 unchanged			
Because now just now you have written that in this			
production function some inputs are kept constant and others are changed			
Here fixed factors are kept constant and variable factors are			
changed during the short period and supply is at the dip at your			
limited extent			
And in the short period then a little laws of returns are			
applicable as the law of increasing return diminishing return and			
constant returns			
These laws will be applicable in the short period 			
Why ?			
Because in the short period you are not taking the fixed factor			
we are simply taking the variable factor			
And when you are taking the variable factor in the beginning			
 then the returns starts increasing 			
Why they start increasing because earlier you are not making			
proper utilisation of the fixed factors of production			
Now you want to increase the production and by employing the			
variable factor you are able to have the better utilisation of the fixed			
factors of production because of this your return have started			
increasing 			
But after some time your result return will start diminishing			
Now why they will start diminishing ?			
Why ?			
Because now the variable factors as you are increasing the variable			
factors on that thing your variable factors are becoming more in			
proportion to the fixed factors and they are getting lesser and lesser			
shares from the fixed factors to work upon them and because of this their			
return starts diminishing 			
So you have to keep this thing in mind that this first type of			
production function is applicable in the short period 			
Now second is there all the inputs can be changed 			
All the factors are changed all the factors are changed 			
So this is the second production function and it is applicable			
in the long run			
Because long period you know is that period where all type of			
adjustments are possible 			
Supply and demand can be adjustable to any extent and all the			
factors of production becomes variable 			
And under this production function you will be selling the returns			
to state 			
Uh became one of the diff diff difference			
 coming between them 			
There in the short period laws of return			
Here returns to state because in the second production			
function you are totaly changing the scale of the production and			
because of the change in the scale of production			
What is the change in the return ?			
That is studied under the returns to state 			
So this is regarding the first concept of the production			
function 			
Then your next will be besides this you must have a idea			
regarding the tot meaning of total 			
product average product and marginal product 			
Because if you are not clear regarding that also then also you			
cannot understand these laws of return 			
So first of all we will study the total product 			
So what that is ?			
Product 			
Now what is the meaning of total cost ?			
Although it is not related to you this but still I want to			
connect this topic with that 			
Total what is the total cost ?			
 A few words 			
I am asking you what is the meaning of total cost ?			
 A few words 			
Don't study at home you one word 			
Total cost is the cost of producing a commodity 			
Whatever total money if a pruducer is spending on the productional			
value providing is known as the total cost 			
Okay and it includes fixed and variable from both 			
Then you have studied the total value cocept also 			
What is total value ?			
It is the money received which is being received by the producer			
 while selling up certain amount of commodity in the market 			
Whatever money he is getting to that we are calling it as the			
total value 			
Now similarly the total product is the amount of the goods 			
which are being produced by a certain number of producers labourers			
or input whatever we are using			
By making use of that whatever we are able to produce to that we			
are calling it as the total product 			
You can write down the meaning of total product 			
Be regular otherwise it will be very difficult for you 			
Begins to dictate 			
Total product of a factor is total product of a factor 			
is the amount of the total output is the amount of the total output			
 produced by given amount of factors produced by given			
amount of factors given amount of factors 			
As the factors are increased total product also starts rising			
Total product also 			
Total product also start rising but the rate of			
increased value but the rate of increased value at different			
levels of output at different levels of output 			
In the beginning in the beginning total product rises			
 at a increasing rate after a point after a point total			
product starts rising total product start rising at diminishing			
rate as the employment of variable factors as the			
employment of variable factors increases as the employment of			
variable factors increases ends to dictate 			
Written			
Now you can take this how you can find out it is increasing 			
You you can take the number of labourers and total 			
product and total product from which you can come to know how it is			
 firstly increasing at an increasing rate then it is increasing at a			
diminishing rate 			
Now accordingly then the zero first labourer is here the total			
product is n unit 			
The second labourer is employed the total product is eighteen			
units 			
The third labourer is employed it is twenty-five 			
the fourth it is thirty and fifth it is thirty-two 			
And fifth labourer it is thirty-two 			
Now what did you come to know from this ?			
It is first of all it is increasing at a increasing rate or not			
 ?			
Than it is increasing at a diminishing rate 			
Than from the first labourer you have employed the second			
labourer the total product has increased from ten to eighteen there has			
been the increase of eight units 			
In the third case also it is not as if there is an increase of the			
 seven units			
Now in fourth case you see there is the increase of only 			
five units			
So the rate of increase is decreasing 			
Then in the fifth case you find there is increase of only the 			
two units 			
Why it is happening this ?			
Because now when the first labourer was there the fixed factors			
were more and they were not being fully utilised 			
When we start with second labourer there was a better			
utilisation of both factors of production and the production has increased			
When we employ the third then also it has increased 			
But after the fourth labourer we find when we have			
employed the fifth labourer the rate of increase in the total product is			
 diminishing			
It is diminishing because as the variable factors are increased			
 they are getting lesser and lesser shares 			
Now these fixed factors you work upon them and because of this 			
their total products starts diminishing			
Okay 			
Is that okay 			
We have in this studio today three prominent persons 			
related to carbohydrates technology and industry 			
Let us introduce ourselves 			
Former senior District Director Ahmadabad Textile Industry			
Research Association 			
He is head of Carbohydrate Research Division 			
He is currently working there as emeritus CSIR Scien			
 uh professor 			
Dr K R Bhattacharya is a former scientist Central Food			
Technological Research Institute 			
And he is an expert in food-carbohydrates 			
And we have Dr P M Shah 			
He is a technologist in a industry related to carbohydrates 			
typically making starch and its products 			
Now Dr Shrivastav I request you to tell us what are			
diverse materials which we call as carbohydrates and what are their			
common and less common uses ?			
Then I'll also like you to elaborate how India			
acquired technology on carbohydrates which we are uh looking			
today 			
And how do we compare in utilization of our carbohydrate research			
 uh carbohydrate resources compared to international level ?			
Carbohydrates are one of the most uh widely and			
 commonly occurring products in nature 			
We use them almost everyday carbohydrates are			
either sugars which are normally sweet 			
Or they are made up of sugars 			
Carbohydrates either are of one unit or two units 			
several units or hundreds of units 			
Those which are one unit are called sugars those which are			
two units are called disaccharides 			
Saccharide is standing for sugar 			
Those which have three units are trisaccharides and so on			
Tetra penta and then polysaccharides which are 			
which have a large number of sugar units in their molecular 			
structure 			
To illustrate the diversity of carbohydrate materials 			
we have here on this table a number of carbohydrate substances			
The first is a single unit sugar called glucose 			
It is also known as dextrose which is commonly used 			
during recuperating process of patients 			
Then we have a disaccharide with which most of you are			
familiar 			
And this is cane-sugar or sucrose the sample is also			
here 			
Then we have a large variety of polysaccharide 			
The most common of which is cellulose 			
By the name itself you can understand that 			
this is the sugar of cells 			
Or the polysaaccharide of cell and that is why the word 			
is cellulose 			
All plant cells are made up of cellulose 			
Among one of the most common substances made up of			
cellulose or cotton a sample of which is here 			
Similarly paper on which we write is also made up 			
of essentially cellulose 			
Then we have another material which actually is a			
seed carbohydrate and it is starch 			
It is a polymer of glucose unit 			
This is also widely present in seeds and in stems 			
and in tubers 			
Some examples of these are also here 			
We have rice which has a large quantity of starch			
 in it 			
Then we have corn from which starch industrially 			
is isolated 			
Now some of these products are converted into food			
materials 			
Snack food or fast food 			
For example the corn when puffed gives popcorn 			
And potato which also contains lot of starch gives potato			
chips 			
These samples are also displayed here 			
Besides the example shown here there are large number of			
other carbohydrates			
For example the skeletal material of insects and			
 sea animals like shrimps and crabs and lobsters is made of			
 made up of a polymer of which is a sugar modified sugar			
 glucose I mean 			
And this polymer is called chitin 			
At present there is lot of interest in this polymer 			
these because it occurs to a very large extent among the sea			
 animals 			
 We're all familiar with the cane sugar industry			
Cane sugar is one of the cheapest and purest 			
organic material which is available 			
It is more than ninety-nine percent pure			
And its cost is anywhere from rupees seven 			
to ten 			
Then we have the cotton which is the basis for 			
all textiles 			
Whether hundred percent cotton or blended cotton 			
Similarly paper as I mentioned earlier is essentially 			
cellulose 			
And the paper is made from the wood which is			
chipped and then converted into pulp and then later on 			
converted into the paper which we use for writing 			
Recently we have a one word industry which			
is uh based in India and in Pakistan 			
And cultivation of it is mostly in Rajasthan Haryana			
 Gujarat and Punjab 			
Although in India we have modified many of these 			
corbohydrate polymers like cellulose starch and gums 			
When we compare the level of technology available			
in our country vis-a-vis the advanced countries we have still 			
far to go 			
Even though India has made considerable progress in 			
utilizing its own sources of carbohydrate materials and 			
based on this several industries old and new have been set up			
Dr Shrivastav has very much elaborated the industrial uses			
of carbohydrates 			
Now Dr K R Bhattacharya who is present with us and he is an			
expert in food uh carbohydrates 			
He can additionally tell us about the technology we have in			
carbohydrate utilization as food 			
You know one of the primary requisites of the food			
 as we like it is its texture 			
By texture I mean the qualities of how we perceive			
the material in our mouth 			
Whether it is hard or soft whether it sticks to the mouth			
 to the teeth or whether it doesn't stick 			
Whether the food crumbles when you bite or it slowly melts 			
So the it is liquidic or it is soft 			
Now this is the totality of these is called			
texture 			
Now take the taste of uh the potato chips Dr Shrivastav has			
mentioned or the the popcorn 			
Now that has crumbled uh if you take uh potato as such 			
then it is soft it doesn't crumble like that 			
Or take for instance the case of idli 			
 which is a very popular food in South India and now has become very			
popular throughout India 			
Now it has a definite texture			
 It's extremely soft and pliable and yet it			
doesn't i i it's not pliable			
in the sense that it it deforms slowly i i i 			
 it brakes 			
 It is it is soft and yet 			
breakable 			
Now the point I am trying to say is that this particular			
characteristic food this called your food its texture is			
contributed most importantly by its carbohydrate contents 			
A rice contains starch about ninety percent starch 			
Maize contains about eighty percent starch potato contains 			
but for its water content virtually mo 			
more than ninety-five percent of starch			
So if if if cornflake and and potato chips 			
And there are other materials which contain other kinds of uh 			
monosaccharide polysaccharide or different kinds of carbohydrates 			
Now it is these carbohydrate content which contribute to the			
largest extent to the texture 			
To our perceptions of food as we like it			
The food have not only nutritional content not only its 			
taste perse but also the texture perception by which we like or			
dislike a kind of food 			
Dr Bhattacharya you've given a very interesting			
example 			
And I suppose the texture of the same carbohydrate food can be			
modified like a cooked vegetable made from potatoes that has one			
texture 			
And the chips have quite a different texture			
So I think this is a part of your technology that we can change			
the texture of the same material 			
Yes uh Prof Mathur what you say is very right 			
Uh as you mentioned potato has one texture 			
Potato fried in a particular way has one texture			
Potato fried in a different way and in different form has a			
slightly different texture 			
But uh what I would like to stress is it is not only			
the way you prepare it is not only the way you process but also			
the inherent inherent uh composition uh inherent trite			
 content quantity quality of the carbohydrate could			
play a very important role 			
Dr Bhattacharya as in one aspect on which you might stress			
upon is the energy which is uh given by the carbohydrate 			
material that are ingested by people 			
Because this is the family source of energy 			
Beside texture energy is a very important factor 			
which is contributed by carbohydrates 			
Yeah I think it's a very good point Dr			
Srivastav and Dr Mathur has reminded me 			
We eat food for for primarily two reasons 			
One is for energy and the other is for various 			
constituents that our body needs 			
Uh energy means various energy doesn't necessarily mean only			
the work that we do 			
We need energy not only for the work we do but our body itself			
is doing millions of functions continously 			
Even if we lie perfectly still and that even then we need			
 approximately twelve hundred to fifty 			
fifteen hundred calories per day just to maintain our body			
functions 			
Now as Dr Srivastav very rightly mentioned it is the			
food which enables us to obtain that is this energy and carry			
out our functions 			
Now it has been shown that carbohydrate particularly starch 			
sugar they contain approximately four calories it is a kind			
of unit a measure like uh inch or metre or gram 			
It is a kind of measure of energy 			
Each gram of sugar or starch or carbohydrate material 			
contains approximately four calory of energy per gram 			
So if we need uh let's say on an average some			
two thousand calories per day an average man 			
Then you can say we would have needed if we ate			
carbohydrate alone we would have needed approximately five hundred grams			
of carbohydrates 			
Of course we don't eat this much because we eat other things as			
well			
You know we not only eat carbohydrates but we eat proteins and			
fat			
And fat supplies much more energy for the unit weight 			
as compared to carbohydrates 			
So as uh Dr Shrivastav has very rightly said supplier of			
energy 			
But uh I'll again come back uh human being's 			
 needs now satiation is a factor 			
So liking is a major one word provide that we			
enjoy our food and that's why you eat 			
We just when we eat we just don't think that we			
must maintain our body and we must have nutrition 			
We enjoy food so we eat 			
And the texture is a very very important part of the content			
Dr P M Shah the technologist in a carbohydrate based			
industry will elaborate about the prospects of this industry 			
 It's relevence to national development and our			
technology compared to international standard 			
Now the relevence of this carbohydrate or carbohydrate			
chemistry is very much in usage to human life 			
Right from morning when you get up you use either a			
carbohydrate or its product 			
Take for example in the morning you're doing like 			
using a tooth paste 			
It contains a product of carbohydrate 			
Secondly you go for a breakfast you have got something 			
on starch 			
You wear clothes it is made up of either cellulose which			
is a carbohydrate 			
Or it is processed with a carbohydrate called starch for			
sizing or finishing 			
Then you come to the uh children for as a confectionery			
 there it is a product of carbohydrate 			
Then you come to the medicine which is required either			
by young boy or a woman or an old man it is also containing some			
products of carbohydrate chemistry 			
Then the industry is such a marvellous industry 			
that none of its product is used is wasted or it is completly			
utilized 			
Take for example the manufacturing of starch 			
There you take either rice starch or maize starch or a			
 one word starch 			
All its constituents are either converted into starch or			
 its uh ingredients are used somewhere in the cattle feeds or			
 in some other indusrty 			
So the beauty of this industry is that nothing is wasted 			
Even the waste water is used for one of the based industry			
called pharmaceutical industry 			
So you can understand the rele relevence			
 of this industry in the human life 			
Now coming to the other aspect of man uh this 			
natio national important things other things			
Now our industry say as for example starch industry or 			
its other products which is called refinery refined 			
 products 			
That is the total productions of the country is to the tune of			
around two hundred crores of rupees 			
And we are utilizing nearly about two hundred			
thousand tonnes of grains 			
Say in terms when I say grain I usually mentioned			
 mention maize 			
Then to the exchequer it is giving nearly about thirty			
to thirty-five crores of rupees 			
Not only that but it gives a direct employment to more			
than eight thousand people 			
And indirect employment to the other eight to ten thousand			
of people 			
Now this is just I give you a small uh some idea 			
about the industry 			
Now what are we manufacturing in carbohydrate industry ?			
We take right from the grain 			
We process the grain and separate its ingredients of which			
it is composed of 			
It is composed of if you take a maize it is composed of			
four parts 			
One is called oil bearing substance called germ then			
protein which is a protein like substance then starch which is a			
carbohydrate and fiber which is called a celluline birch 			
Now similarly also in one word or in rice you			
have got not only same proportion but a different proportion of			
starch and fiber or celluline substances 			
Now technically speaking when we are doing this			
carbohydrate industry starch or a refinery product our 			
machinaries are practically comparable to what we have got in			
the most advanced countries 			
Not only that but our products are meeting the standards			
and specifications of international requirements 			
You take our products it meets I P standard but it			
also meets U S standard or British standard 			
That is all our products are meeting the standards 			
Therefore you can very well understand that the processes			
that we are using it the technology that we are adopting is			
same as what all other advanced countries are using 			
And technologically I don't think we will be in any way 			
away or slightly different 			
Only thing we may have some difficulty that the			
advancement of the computerization which is available in the			
western countries may not be here because we have to use either a			
human or we have to use a human as well as a mechanical man not that			
much of computerization 			
The last phases of the election campaign are coming			
upon us very soon 			
It has been a tragic election in a way 			
Introductive tragically 			
And we are now approaching the last phases 			
 phase of the election 			
With uh me this evening is a very interesting panel 			
We have our the chief election commissioner Mr Seshan and			
 we've Dileep Padgaonkar editor of The Times Of India			
 and we have Prabhu Chawla a great one word of			
 Indian Express and I'm Nihal Singh a			
columnist 			
Uh Mr Seshan if I might ask a rather genuine question to			
begin with 			
You have proved to be the most controversial chief election			
commissioner in India's history 			
Uh do you think it is because of the prevailing political			
climate ?			
Or do you think it is because of your personality ?			
Or do you think it's the combination of both ?			
I think my good fortunes are related to several factors 			
I think the current election is perhaps the most sensitised			
election as I've been saying for the last two three months of			
all the election that have been held in this country 			
Uh certain things have improved certain things have not			
improved 			
Of course you ask the question which I'm a little at a			
loss of word to answer am I controversial ?			
I remember telling somebody very recently and I would like to			
repeat that that I was not intending to be a very soft aids weapon of			
doing this work 			
I had uh cautioned everybody that the election commission			
intended to take it's work seriously 			
And make sure that the country would get the election which it is			
entitle to which is a fair and free election 			
And as far as I'm concerned anything which comes in the			
way of a fair and free election it's a good object to be			
satisfied 			
If unfortunately that produces controversy I'll say			
 two words I've sinned 			
Well I think Dileepji wanted to raise the question of the			
abruptness of some of the decision no I how they were taken			
 ?			
 No I 			
No I I did want to take off from where you left 			
To say that uh we have here a situation where the 			
entire political class seems to be ranged against the election			
commissioner 			
And I I have been trying very hard to find out how he's			
 achieved this remarkable feat in this remarkable period of time			
Uh is it because uh not just that you wanted to to take			
this election seriously but also that the rot in the electoral process			
that stretch in such a long time ago			
Did you expect to stand it in one go so to speak ?			
Uh Dileep I must apologise for not responding to the			
statement you made about what did you say the rot which is set into the			
system 			
In my own rather limited way I've been saying and I			
will say that what had happened as I mentioned before is a certain			
loss of credibility in the election systems spread all over the country 			
And it's loss merely is not a question of losing faith in			
election in one small part of the country or the other 			
The entire system's credibility is at stake 			
Now you put it in stronger language I am by training and			
otherwise not accustom to using harsh language 			
So my answer to your question would be that uh uh may be			
you are perfectly right in saying that I tried to put right whatever was			
in my view not right or whatever is in the country's view not right			
Uh at a rather faster phase then what the system could digest 			
But all that I can tell you is that the founding fathers in the			
constitutional the representation of the people rank clothed the			
election commission with an abundance of powers 			
Which the lordships in the supreme court repeatedly replace it			
until these are power 			
As one set of lordship once said it is not as if the			
election commission so one word in a difficult situation hold			
its hands and fold in prayer and say good Lord give me guidence what to			
do 			
Yet I do even now pray to god for guidence very often 			
But I don't always wait and stand until the guidance is fully			
available in writing 			
I should act 			
This I have made clear and I have acted to the best of my			
ability			
No Mr Seshan I am raising a different question all together			
Belief has ended with broader question of rot which has set			
into the system 			
But I rightly put in the beginning that you were determined to 			
to remove any obstacle in the free and fair elections 			
But what it counts around now after your various action			
postponing the election counter manding the election 			
It seems you have assigned to yourself the role of a supreme			
court judge of India 			
Where you don't hear anybody 			
You deliver justice without telling anybody what are the cause			
for delivering this particular kind of justice			
 You're giving a judgement saying you're 			
hang 			
When somebody protest then you say come here and 			
I'll hear you 			
What is now that is trying the credibility of situation is your			
one sense sided decision making 			
You have not heard anybody 			
You see in a political democracy dialogue is an 			
ess essential ingre ingredient 			
 of a political system 			
And you're just sacrificing the dialogues at all 			
Well uh Prabhu all the time I say is that I indoubtely			
agree with you			
You said you're a supreme court judge doing			
various things 			
 I'm equated to a supreme court			
Correct but they hear everything			
No no no I'm not			
 You're not hearing like supreme court			
No no no I'm not denying in the least that the right			
 natural right of justice of being heard ought to be available 			
But I can only go by the rule book which parliament has handed			
me down 			
In certain places what does it say for example if I may at the			
risk of uh of of of wasting listeners time mention in fact			
Yes you have to waste listeners time			
No I I			
No no no no			
I am not			
No no no			
I was not suggesting that you			
Let me complete first because you have been when you are			
quoting the parliament 			
 Is the has the parliament given you			
power not to hear anybody ?			
No no please no I was not I was not suggesting			
 in the least that your question was a waste of time I said I'm			
 going to quote a section of law which could tantamount to spending a			
little mere time when it is justified 			
It says if the election commission is satisfied it can			
do so and so so and so in appropriate place 			
Now I don't want to get into again a legal argument for the			
question			
 You're perfectly right that if the time is available			
and the oppurtunity is available the courses of natural justice must all			
be followed			
I have no disagreement with that at all 			
But if you had to take a decision which have to be taken 			
 in within hours if not less than hour 			
Then it is not always possible to go through hearings and what			
not 			
Number two is that where the proof is abstractedly available			
 without necessarily listening to but it is not			
For example you refer to counter manding 			
This counter manding decisions are not taken against any candidate			
It is against the state or place in a particular constituency 			
 A few words 			
But does it what are the implications of counter manding			
Implications are serious 			
But			
If you cannot hear the party			
No parliament in nineteen eighty-nine decided that			
if booth capturing happens the election commission and if I may say so			
with great respect it doesn't say election commission may it says			
 the election commission shall countermand the election 			
After hearing the party			
No he says not hearing the party 			
 No no 			
Let me again mention this to you that where a situation has			
produced evidence adequate enough to say that hearing is not necessary I			
feel it called upon I feel called upon to take a decision 			
I mean I don't disagree with you			
I do not want to disagree with you at any stage 			
That a right of ordinary justice natural justice demands that			
somebody should be heard who is likely to be affected 			
But in that case somebody might even argue if I countermand the			
election in a particular constituency I should hear all the people 			
Why only the candidates ?			
If I countermand the election in constituency X then 			
surely I should hear all the people in that and not merely the twenty thirty			
forty candidates who have filled up I I mean who have been nominated			
by the			
Mr Seshan you are trying to set up conventions 			
Which are creat which are creating 			
 more problem			
You are creating political instability by deciding			
decision one taking one decision in the morning taking			
some other decisions two days later			
 May I may I put it more			
specifically this point 			
Uh the fact that you said you counteremanded X number of uh			
 consitituencies			
Alright elections in these constituencies 			
Later you came round to say well I'm 			
reconsidering my decisions 			
Now that leaves you open to a lot of criticism and also it 			
 it intr introduces instable 			
instability in the political set-up 			
That is one point			
And the other is uh that has been raised by a number			
of parties is that you are supposed to have told one delegation that			
 as far as election officer's reports are concerned the			
days those days are over now that is how it's been			
reported 			
Maybe you would like to answer this question 			
 Well let me answer the second part first 			
And uh I I I'll come up to a little later as far as			
the question of total dependability of the official heirarchy of			
officers to be impartial in all that they do is regretably no longer			
available 			
Whether it is uh officers at higher level officers at the			
lower level or one word work reciding in polling offices and polling			
stations 			
People who work as magistrates and others people at higher			
level district election officers and still higher 			
I may say with all the humility I possess 			
In all the humility I possess that the point of time at which 			
one could say without asking any question that this report would be totally			
impartial 			
Any content mistakes of facts which are genuinely mistakes of fact			
But which they are not those of if I may use very bad word			
committed people is no longer available 			
This I did mention to more than one political party 			
But we have tried to make sure that there are enough			
checks and balances built-in in order to ensure that somebody say so if			
not adequate for taking an action 			
This is as far as it concern			
Now you raise the other question you countermanded and			
then you are hearing people			
Yes 			
Does this create the instability 			
It certainly creates doubts in the minds of people whether			
the election commission is in two minds about its own decisions			
As far as I am concerned those five counteremanding decisions			
were taken with a full sense of responsibility after analyzing the status			
and hundreds and hundreds of reports which were received on the twentieth			
There was official report they were none of the			
official report			
No I'm sorry I I don't concede that			
statement to you 			
I don't concede the fore factual possession to you 			
You may be referring to report from a certain set of offices like			
Look here chief election commissioners office in the			
state			
 I'm again mentioning you			
 You've the returning officer in the state			
 I'm mentioning it you			
I have reports of the returning officers 			
I have reports of the chief electoral officer			
Recommending rec recommending 			
 this countermanding 			
Look I I I'm sorry			
I am not going into individual specifics 			
I am mentioning again 			
In coming to certain conclusions we are not taking into			
account or failing to take into account any kinds of valid information			
I will tell you we have returning officers reports 			
We have chief electoral officers reports 			
I have sent out three hundred central officers 			
Now you might well ask what is this enormous waste of resources			
and money to sent three hundred observers 			
Now what was behind the sending of observer somebody could			
have asked this question 			
Why do you have to sent central observers and state observers			
They sent all the time			
Last time we had 			
 They are not sent all the time 			
They were			
Not three hundred but hundred a few words 			
 I'm may I mention with all great			
respect that last time around a total of seventy-five people were deployed			
throughout the country 			
This time I deployed three hundred not because I would like supply			
to deploy more			
Therefore the election has not been smooth even			
after deploying three hundred			
No no I don't recommend that 			
 Election has been 			
 I will let me tell you the elections were smooth in			
Haryana 			
They were smooth in Himachal they were smooth in Rajasthan 			
they were smooth in Madhya Pradesh they were smooth in Andhra Pradesh			
except for minor cases here and there 			
They were good in Andaman they were good in Lakshadweep 			
They were largely good in West Bengal 			
Now you come to the core area of U P and Bihar 			
We get into areas of greater and greater worry 			
I won't use any other word 			
We get into areas of greater and greater worry 			
 That's why there is some charge that you are			
listenning to a particular political group			
No no look I have mentioned again and let me again submit			
to you that if at the thick of the game people get ang 			
 angry against the umpire 			
I am sorry the umpire will have to put with it 			
 In Hindi 			
You know that's right			
Today was uh suppose to have been the first day of brave new			
India 			
A day on which we were to radically restructure our our			
economic policies			
And therefore transit on to a high growth path after a short			
period of painful adjustment on			
And that was what it was supposed to be			
How it turned out to be is really going to be our discussion			
We are likely to have with us on the panel today people who have			
been in one way or the other involved in this uh exercise to fashions			
a brave new India			
 I'll uh introduce them straight away 			
Uh Mr Pranab Mukharjee deputy chairman of the planning			
commission Mr Deepak Nair chief economic adviser of ministery of finance			
Government of India Mr V K Loria is here as an a 			
 consultant 			
Also with us on the panel uh on our side of the panel is			
in-house one word uh Dileep Cherian and therefore I'll			
 take off by asking Dileep the first question			
Dileep do you think uh the way the day has unfolded it was uh			
 brave new India in the making ?			
 I'm not entirely sure whether it's uh 			
brave enough 			
Sure Mr Manmohan Singh has done quite a few things that			
this country desperately needs 			
 It's certainly an economist kind of budget with lots			
of political cheese cake thrown in 			
But the budget has to be really seen in the backdrop of the			
other major documents that was presented today which is the industrial			
policy 			
As it needed to address in some sense three or four			
basic needs of the hour 			
One the need for austerity 			
Second a need to restore confidence in those who seek and			
ought to invest in India 			
And three to fashion as it were a completely new kind of			
economy 			
But to my mind the budget does do some other things that is			
including these areas 			
It certainly delivers as far as the capital market is			
concerned 			
I think it does some of the much needed reform to the money			
market 			
 I'm happy to see that defence expenditure has			
been held at the level at which be held 			
And a lot of the restructuring in the customs duties to my			
mind move in the right direction 			
But that's not enough 			
I think it disappoints in certain other areas 			
Uhm I am not entirely happy with what happened as far as the			
public sector is concerned 			
Neither an industrial policy nor as far as the budget is			
concerned are enough signals being given as to what is going to happen in			
that area 			
Not enough is seen as far as curbing of conspicous consumption			
 that has become a social problem in the country is going to be			
done 			
And I am worried about the signals that are sending out for			
corporate investment 			
And I think for some reason or the other perhaps for good			
reason of his own Manmohan Singh seems to have been dissident on			
three other areas 			
One is on the business of N R I except for what he has			
done as far as gifts are concerned 			
This doesn't seem to be enough incentive for N R I's 			
to invest back in India again 			
I am concerned about the hesitation to hit at subsidies 			
much much harder 			
And I don't see enough effort in this whole belt tightening			
exercise that we've been talking on for so long in tightening of			
government expenditure 			
So these to my mind are areas we ought to worry about 			
There are two more areas that I would think cause concern			
today 			
I am worried about the kind of unchecked growth of interest			
payment 			
 It's forty-two percent now 			
And Dr Singh says that it is going to go up to fifty percent			
 if it's not checked by nineteen ninety-four nineteen			
ninety-five 			
And this would have been a very good time to get rid of			
that burden of debt release to rural sector which seems to 			
be uh costing the economy about for four thousand			
five hundred crores in the three year period that we are			
looking at 			
These to my mind are areas of concerned today 			
 A summary of Mr Cherian's view is repeated in			
Hindi 			
I see that uh Mr Mukharjee has got the congress			
manifesto			
Open to page twenty-two which says which says			
 the economy uh Mr Mukharjee I'm sure you agree with			
Dileep when he says that it delivers on A B M C 			
But I'm sure you have uh difference with him when			
 when he says that it's diffident disappoints			
 and areas of concerned 			
Uh firstly I would like to point out that budget			
is one instrument followed with many other which reflects the 			
 government's policy 			
And particularly this year's budget is to be reviewed			
 in the context of industrial policy resolution which has been			
announced this morning 			
Trade policy which has which was 			
announced a little earlier and certain readjustment programme			
which have been initiated by the government itself 			
Congress as a party was committed to the electorate of			
this country to restore balance in the economic system and 			
wanted to put the economy on rate 			
Therefore certain structural adjustment were absolutely needed			
 if we wanted to come out of wood 			
To my mind this budget is an adjustment budget in the			
sense it has initiated a large number of message which will pay			
dividend in course of time 			
Bold initiative was needed and bold initiative has been			
taken 			
Uh pardon me for interrupting Mr Mukharjee now			
Uh Dileep made a point and he says that he is disappointed 			
uh at what budget has done in the public sector for instance uh			
uh 			
The expectation was that it would much more would be done			
 Uh uh 			
 I'm coming to that 			
If you look at the industrial policy resolution and the			
proposals in the budget you will find that what we committed we have			
done it 			
Firstly the area of operation of public sector has been limited			
 and more areas have been open to private sector 			
This investment in the public sector has been announced in			
the budget and through these process public sector would be made			
 more accountable competitive and it would serve the social			
 obligation for which the public sector institutions are built up 			
Even his comment in respect of the for instance uh our			
liabilities towards the interest payment			
I do agree that it is uh sizeably of high order 			
But what can you do ?			
No finance minister can say that he will not fulfill the			
commitment by paying interest on the past borrowing 			
Therefore finance minister has made it quite clear in his			
statement that the distortions which have taken place will be ractified			
 over the period of year 			
Certain time will be needed 			
 That's why this year's borrowing has been 			
limited 			
Even the reduction of non-developmental expenditure 			
non-planned expenditure is substantial 			
And the budget has given a clear message what the government feels			
Uh uh may I may I just take up from uh there 			
Deduction in non-planned expenditure is something that I would			
like to ask uh Mr Nair this question 			
Uh may be we had a gap of information			
So therefore you could clarify if we have gap of information 			
Is that you said deduction in non-planned expenditure is			
down by four point nine percent if you exclude interest payment 			
And in the very next line uh you go on to say that actually it			
is down by over fifteen percent 			
Now these are two uh is it is it 			
that eleven point two percent went down on government uh on the interest			
payment 			
Now let me explain non-planned expenditure excluding			
interest payment in terms of the budget estimates for ninety-one			
ninety-two is four point nine percent lower than the revised estimate			
 for nineteen ninety ninety-one 			
Now if we had introduced low one word and expenditure			
 non-planned expenditure has con had			
continued in keeping with past trend 			
Then the level would have which would have wished uh is the			
level from which have attend the fifteen percent production 			
So fifteen percent is ex-hypothesis so if you four			
point nine percent is with respect to the non-planned expenditure of past			
year			
 So if you 			
It is in a sense phenomi phenominal			
 figure it's not a real figure 			
Because I think the budget says that it's sixty-two			
thousand crore rupees it would have reached had low			
corrective been applied			
That that refers to fiscal deficit 			
May I 			
You know I believe that the union budget for nineteen			
ninety-one ninety-two must be situated in the wider context of the			
crisis in the economy that is both acute and deep 			
Micro economic imbalances lie at the root of this problem 			
The government has leaped beyond its means 			
It has done so by borrowing at home 			
The country has leaped beyond its means 			
It has done so by borrowing abroad 			
Now I'm sure you would accept that neither the			
government nor the country can afford to leap beyond its means year			
after year 			
But these are			
Now			
I am sorry I mean would you say that the kind of 			
pace at which the adjustment of living beyond one's means is			
being done fast enough 			
At this point of time given the crisis we have the			
adjustment could have been sweeped up and more substantive 			
The same incentive and the same one word is that as it			
was may not be there next year 			
When you two words when the finance minister present his			
budget 			
I do not agree 			
Look any further postponement of micro-economic adjustment 			
which is long over due uh would make an exceedingly difficult 			
situation 			
 No I'm not asking about the question I			
think two or three persons speaking together 			
No not at all uh I believe that what we have achieved			
in this year in terms of a credible fiscal adjustment which I hope			
would lead to micro-economical stabilization during the current financial			
year and continued fiscal consolidation thereafter is impressive 			
Let us not think in terms of the coventional budget deficit 			
which is the borrowing the short term borrowing of the government from			
the Reserve Bank of India 			
Let us look at the revenue deficit which is the difference			
between revenue expenditure and the revenue received to the government 			
Or the fiscal deficit which is the difference between the			
revenue received and the total expenditure of the government that is met by			
borrowing 			
Now what we have done this year is to reduce both the revenue			
deficit and the fiscal deficit not simply in absolute terms as			
compared to last year			
But in very substantial terms as a proportion of G D P 			
Now the fiscal deficit is going to come down by two			
percent in point of G D P that is about twelve thousand crores			
 			
Dileep that is not insubstantial that is very substantial			
Now we are we're achieving this by two means 			
On one hand you have revenue received two thousand 			
crores of additional resource mobilization that is both			
progressive and non-inflationary and two thousand five hundred 			
crores a few words 			
So we come to Mr Loria uh let us get quick comment			
 Dileep on what Mr Mukharjee said then what Mr Nair said and then uh			
No as far as the forces of adjustment having begun I			
certainly have no quarrel			
But I think this we didn't have very much choice 			
The second factor we need to look at in this budget is the			
context in which it was written in a sense 			
Meaning we have to make sure that we confirm to certain needs			
of the international community which is one of the potential lenders 			
that needs to have confidence in India 			
The point that is some how seems to worry is that I worry			
because the political will to do change is most when the crisis is			
more secured 			
And I do think that the backdrop of the kind of manifesto that			
the Congress had which before it came into power as you hear allowed for			
many of these changes 			
Some of them are there in the industrial policy some are there			
in trade policy			
But more could have been achieved is what I feel 			
And if the pressure is off I worry that the pressure on			
the ministry on the finance ministry in a sense to do this is to be			
 reduced 			
 Dileep let us now speak of uh some way 			
 where you left off that 			
 A few words yeah okay 			
 A summary of Mr Mukharjee's view is repeated			
in Hindi 			
Vinod let's now get the voice of uh industry and			
uh the professional sector 			
Mr Loria what do you think uh there are some confusing or uh			
 one can say not very uh encouraging signal for the corporate sector			
for instance the deputation has been stuck 			
Uh for instance the cooperation tax has gone up 			
And then the three main fears of industry which was in both			
 confession which was uh the liquidity squeeze and which was			
inflation are still there are still hanging over industry			
So how do you expect industry to react to this budget ?			
Well I will put it this way 			
Uh I I first like to make a very brief comment on what I think of			
the budget I think it's one word 			
 Sure 			
And I it we may not be awakening to a brave new year 			
But we have certainly not going to awaken every year to a			
brand new budget 			
This has set the pace it has set a new path 			
And I think from next year onwards we will not wait for			
this day with bated breath 			
This man was lucky 			
Mr Doraswamy who has been in captivity now for weeks of			
agonizing weeks 			
Agonizing both for his family and for the nation 			
We still don't know when he is and if he is going to be released			
Now terrorism itself is a form of blackmail 			
But holding hostages is even worse 			
We have here now on my immediate left Mr George Verghese			
 the distinguished journalist and Mr Jamanadas Akhtar the			
distinguished writer 			
Both happened to be members of the Press Council 			
But we have resisted the temptation of discussing George's			
 famous report 			
Because George has better face his critics not his			
supporters 			
Now George would you give us some of the national and			
international dimensions of this holding hostages 			
Well taking of hostages has been with us for sometimes 			
Uh throughout history hostages have been used as a means of			
building up pressure on authority of whatever kind 			
In more recent times we have seen high-jacking as taking up			
hostages in the air 			
Whole groups of perfectly innocent people who are flying			
from one place to some other destination 			
And using that to ask for whatever it is left the			
captors wanted 			
Around the ground as we've seen in many part of the			
world and in our own country uh the taking of hostages is again being			
used as a means to pressurise authority 			
To use to specific demands that are made by various 			
groups that take them in captivity 			
 We've just seen the clip about the Swedes who			
were taken hostages in Kashmir and U F F to Mr Doraswamy 			
But we have the same problem in other parts of India in			
Assam in Andhra Pradesh may be in Punjab 			
And in other parts of the world in Iran in Lebanon and uh			
 elsewhere 			
So that this is becoming a universal phenomenon and one which			
 civilize nations and government and communities have to fight 			
 It's not an easy task because it is traumatic both			
for the individuals and their families as well as to the governments who			
have to decide and for the community at large 			
Miss Akhtar with a special background of Kashmir			
connection would you like to through some light 			
Yes 			
I would like to confine myself to the problem in			
Kashmir 			
I remember that in nineteen seventy-seven when I was in			
Birmingham the Kashmir Liberation Front leaders were there			
They had their headquarters 			
They had abducted a senior diplomat from the India			
 Indian High Commission 			
They wanted to get release Mr Makbul Butt 			
But when the government didn't release they killed that			
Indian diplomat 			
And after that Makbul Gutt Butt 			
was hanged in Tihar jail 			
The same Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front British 			
news alleged Major Amanulla had their head quarters in			
Muzaffarabad and also in Karachi 			
 He went he run away to America 			
when the government wanted to arrest him 			
He came back to Kashmir and came back to Kashmir			
 and Pakistan 			
He organized a gang and he started terrorism 			
Uh at the first uh his uh party didn't uh			
indulged in kidnapping 			
But there're other groups in Kashmir 			
The main group is Hizbul Mujahideen 			
It is controlled by the Jamait-e-Islami of Pakistan 			
And its head in Pakistan is Kazi Hussain Ahmed 			
 This this Jamait as you remember I			
think that in the last phase of the Bangladesh government these			
Jamait Islami workers they picked up several uhm professors 			
doctors and others and killed them in Dacca 			
And this Jamait Islami it was accused of uh hiring the			
services of uhm of Sayed Akbar who had assassinated Mr Liyakat Ali			
Khan 			
Another worker of the Jamait Islami had assassinated Dr Khan			
Sahib 			
And now they have uh so many workers there're so			
many terrorist a a armed terrorist			
They had uh fighting			
They were fighting in Afghanistan 			
Then they shifted to Muzaffarabad 			
They are infiltrating into Kashmir valley of Kashmir 			
And mainly this this gang is responsible for kidnapping the			
uh intellectuals professors engineers and others			
You imply that our friend and neighbour is actively involved			
Yes it is actively involved 			
 He will not it will he will not say			
that he is actively or any way involved in it			
For instance in ninety-seven forty-seven when Pakistan			
attacked Kashmir the Pakistan government said no we're 			
not involved in it 			
These are some tribals who are who has gone there to help			
their brothers 			
In sixty-five when Pakistan again attacked Kashmir General			
Ayub Khan said no we are not concerned with it 			
The people of Kashmir has risen in rebellion in			
nineteen seventy-one they attacked again Kashmir 			
And when general Zia at uh induced or 			
 organized a rebellion in in Afghanistan he			
said no we're not concerned with the rebellion 			
 We're just helping these uh uh sharnarthis			
 from Afghanisthan 			
 We're not giving anything uh uh arms or weapons or			
other anything to these uh persons 			
Now this same group headed by that Gulbadan Hikmat Yar 			
is organizing these raids 			
 Pakistan government is supplying weapons and 			
we know that what is going going on in Karachi now Jamait Islami			
says that its workers are being kidnapped and and tortured and			
assassinated in Karachi by their political elements 			
 One word 			
Are there training schools for kidnapping too do they			
Yes they have 			
 They they have kidnapping and training			
schools for kidnapping and terrorism around Muzaffarabad and then			
in tribal area 			
George do you agree with this uh analysis or view 			
Well I I'm not sure about the background and the 			
uh details			
Because question of kidnapping and hostages is not confined 			
to Kashimr as I said it's a phenomenon one finds uh in 			
 many many places in our own country and abroad 			
The question is why is it done ?			
 It's a form of psychological warfare to build pressure			
 whether for political aims or for other aims 			
Now in Kashmir there are several groups 			
You mentioned the Swedes 			
I think uh they were detained by particular group I am			
not sure whether Jungbaz Jungbaz the the Jungbaz force 			
 I'm not sure whether it is the same group that has uh kidnapped			
 Jungbaz Jungbaz 			
Is it true that the groups run into hundreds now 			
More than one hundred			
 What the 			
More the official count is about one hundred and			
forty-three			
Uhm 			
But here again the the problem that the authorities face			
 is in dealing with uh a multitude of different groups which			
have perhaps different sub-motivations within a larger purpose 			
And the question that the country has to face is whether in the			
Kashmir or elsewhere 			
How does one deal with this ?			
Does one submit ?			
Does one give in ?			
Or does one hold out and with what consequences ? 			
but it 			
I think this is the central issue that needs to be faced 			
 But it 			
It it suits our friendly neighbour to have as many			
groups as possible			
So that you know you can't deal with anyone particular 			
 So that no political solution is possible isn't it			
 ?			
 Well 			
Well that well that may be so			
Uhm 			
But as I would say if one looks at the problem in Assam 			
Alpha or peoples war group in Andhra it's a different			
set of circumstances there 			
But kidnappings yeah have been used as a prime			
instrument of pressure			
Therefore it's not just Kashmir and I think we need to			
look at this not as isolated problems			
Kashmir or Andhra or Assam or anywhere else 			
But to try and fasten a national approach to dealing with the			
problem that could adopt anywhere for the variety of political 			
and other reasons			
 Yeah 			
But you see even the former Home Minister's 			
 daughter was kidnapped and there was prompt action 			
One criticism was that they acted propmtly because he was the Home			
Minister of the country 			
Yes 			
Now in the case of others it drags on as in case of			
Dorayswamy for weeks 			
Would you view this as a moral problem as a legal problem 			
as a national problem 			
How would you categorise this problem George ?			
Well it's not a legal problem 			
 It's really illegal 			
 It's beyond the bounds of the law and and and the			
constitution			
Yeah 			
It is a moral problem uhm and a political			
problem			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
The kidnapping of the Home Minister the former Home Minister			
Mufti uh Sayeed's daughter uh Rubia Sayeed was perhaps			
the first of this latest series 			
And may be thinking a new government had come into being and a new			
chapter was opening there was some pressure on the government to release 			
uh to negotiate with the uh captors of this young lady and secure her			
release			
And the other view was the government should have held out 			
Because there was strong criticism of the kidnapping of a woman			
 which was considered to be unIslamic against any of the			
traditions that were being upheld uh as the course which the struggle			
was being waged 			
But for what ever reason the government gave in 			
I must confess that I myself for that time went along with the			
feeling that all right if the release is granted uh and this			
young hostage is released Miss Sayeed uh may be that's a good			
thing 			
But I think perhaps we need to think afresh because once that			
 is has happened it has made it more difficult			
for the government in successive cases to take a stand because the			
question immediately uh raised is well why aren't you			
negotiating for the release of this hostage ?			
Is it because he or she does not have a Home Minister 			
as a father or some other very important person as a brother 			
And does not the life of an ordinary average person count as			
much ?			
That is the dilemma that we now face 			
Perhaps the time has come when I think across the board we			
have to take a view whether it is Kashmir or Andhra or Assam or			
 one word or anywhere else 			
Whether it is a government of one complexion or another call			
an all party meeting to take a national view of how the nation should			
deal with hostages 			
Otherwise one is going to be blackmailed all along the line			
everywhere by anybody 			
What do you think Miss Akhtar Mansoor			
 Two word I feel that there is no difference 			
between kidnapping for ransom or kidnapping for putting pressures 			
to get the criminals released 			
What happens a man murders six seven eight twenty 			
 per persons 			
When he is arrested his party kidnaps any person 			
Maybe two three four persons			
A professor may be a doctor may be engineer or or a high			
official 			
And they say that you release our criminal friend 			
otherwise we will assassinate your persons			
Yes			
Now this is I think this is a crime 			
And no government should give in 			
What happens when you start releasing these the 			
persons the kidnappers they feel that their position has become			
strong 			
George if I may express my own view life is more			
complex than particular formulation 			
Yes 			
Uh there can not be a white and black case of either you			
release or not release 			
Situations will differ 			
Circumstances will differ personalities will differ 			
How and in a democracy public opinion will met 			
Well personalities will differ yes 			
But will principles differ ?			
That is the question 			
And I think as Jamnadasji has said you are really bargaining			
 with criminals 			
Take the case of Mr Doraswamy some people have been released			
 as part of the bargain uhm which was not kept by the			
other side according to the government 			
 Uhm 			
Uh the kidnappers want one of their leaders I think it is			
uh Mr Shalla to be released 			
Now according to the official version Mr Shalla was			
responsible uh for the killing earlier of uh some hostages			
 including Prof Na Nashirul Huque 			
the very distinguished Vice Chancellor of Kashmir University 			
And subsiquently Mr Khera the General Manager of the H M T			
plant in Shrinagar 			
Now if because of the pressure of Mr Doraswamy's 			
kidnapping a killer of two other hosteges earlier is to be released			
 then what is the principle involved and where is 			
will it end 			
Because this will be go on from one hostage to			
another and the government will be made to yield all along the line			
And that would be unacceptable 			
I think you are quite right in saying there is no absolute norm			
 there is no black and white yeah that is true 			
But some governments the Israeli government for instance has			
taken the line that they are not going to submit to any kidnapping 			
And let the kidnappers face the consequences of killing			
 their hostages 			
Let public opinion and their own people turned against			
them because they too are under psychological pressure 			
 Yeah 			
So I think we need to take a national view			
Otherwise I can't see this problem being uh whisked			
away 			
 It's going to sail us week after week in one			
situation or another 			
What I think we need to do is that to get together all			
political parties to discuss this 			
What should be the national policy that is taken ?			
Whether it is a Congress government in Andhra uh Congress			
government in uh Assam and opposition government in some			
other place President's rule George			
 Assam 			
Frankly I I one or two words any unanimity on any			
problem in this country 			
Name me one problem on which the country is whole heartedly			
 unanimously agreed 			
Well if it is not easy but I think if one tries to be			
still what are the principles ?			
Yes			
Are all hostages of the same ?			
Yeah			
Is the motivation the same ?			
Is it political ?			
Is it criminal ?			
What is the background ?			
Can one then distill some principles on the basis which public			
opinion will assert itself 			
Certainly it is one thing to negotiate 			
But I think negotiation is part of the process of high-jacking 			
of wearing down the opponent			
Yes 			
Get them confused 			
Get them to contridict themselves 			
Develop rival force and pressures in the other camp weaken			
their resolve 			
Give more time to investigative forces to find out where these			
hostages are ?			
See if if they can be rescued			
I think that barring a two or three			
political parties extremist may be in Punjab all other political			
parties will join hands and support the government if the government 			
wants to take some strong step 			
 Yes 			
George would you favour that there should not be			
compromise at any cost 			
What is your personal view ?			
Well as I say I started out in this round ah 			
personally taking a view that is alright if Rubia Sayeed was was			
released 			
 Ah 			
I now feel perhaps that was a mistake 			
 A mistake 			
Because once we did that we were on the slippery			
slope 			
And it has been said by others are we not as good as 			
that young lady ?			
Is it not the same blood ?			
Does the more recent hostages not have parents relatives			
 friends			
Miss Akhtar what is your solution ?			
My solution is that the government should take strong uh			
uh position and should get co-operation from the opposition parties 			
Mr Sahay the difficulty is that in Punjab Mr Verghese			
knows though the news have not been appeared they are not so flashed			
But actually there are so many cases in which the government			
 have has released criminals 			
But gentleman would it be a fair summing up 			
if we say that we agree that holding hostages is one of the			
most criminal acts 			
 And 			
Absolutely			
Yes 			
We are agreed that there is uh a need for a national			
consensus on this 			
Yes 			
National and international			
And international and also we are agreed that the			
political parties should meet 			
Perhaps to that we may add that it's not enough			
for political parties to meet intellectuals social workers others			
The inter-state council so that state government			
brought in 			
 Uhm uhm uhm 			
Yes brought in 			
But that it is not merely a government problem 			
 It's an emotional and human problem			
Absolutely			
Yes			
And it has to be dealt with at that level 			
Hope so			
 That's right			
Would you like to add something in about a minute 			
I think that uh your solution is correct and uh we			
must support it 			
George ?			
Yes 			
Well it is uh not merely necessary to built that uh 			
that that consensus 			
But also try and understand the psychology at work 			
So that we can deal with it			
It is a form of psychological warfare			
Yes			
So the nation has to be prepared to accept that 			
And public opinion ultimately must prevail in these matters 			
 and that needs to be educated			
 Than 			
We may perhaps end this discussion on the note that we			
 have fervently hope and pray that Doraswamy or whoever else			
 or whoever is held captive probably is released 			
And the government doesn't really totally surrender on this matter			
Naturally our hearts goes to Mrs Doraswamy and family 			
Yes			
And to all others 			
But this is a problem that we really must confess 			
Significantly the Liberation Front has also appealed for his			
release 			
I hope I mean he gets released soon			
On this note gentleman I thank you			
Thank you			
Thank you 			
This is All India Radio 			
Taking sides in our national programme tonight we bring you a			
discussion on media attitudes in the context of privatisation of the			
electronic media 			
Since only the very rich can afford these private channels will			
the content of their programme reflect their bias and the bias of the			
advertisers 			
The programmes be aimed only at those who can afford them 			
All those who run these channels be persuaded to aim them at the			
poor and the backward 			
We view the electronic media as an instrument of social and			
economic upliftment 			
In short will the social attitude and economic compulsions of			
the fourth estate force them as it has in the past to take sides			
Taking part in the discussion are Kuldeep Nayyar the emminent			
 coloumnist Madhu Trehan executive producer News Track P C			
Chatterji former director general All India Radio and B G Verghese			
 the noted columnist who also moderates the discussion 			
We are discussing this evening uh social attitudes on			
the part of the media uh broadcast print and the other 			
But the very main point to start with the is the			
discussion that has been initiated uh rising out of the congress			
manifesto which suggest the need for privatisation uh			
broadcasting or atleast some competitive challenge through public 			
co-operation 			
Will this really change broadcasting ?			
Will the content of programmes undergo any change ?			
And will the viewers and listeners get something more 			
different from what they get now ?			
Uh Madhu what do you think ?			
 First first of all I think the			
government has to make its position clear 			
Nothing has been clarified by the minister about what exactly			
they are planning to do 			
Uh there is a lot of confusion and if this is any indication			
for what the new channel is going to be like I don't think there will be much			
opening up 			
First of all they have to take a de 			
decision on whether they are going to clear Doordarshan			
 because if they do open up a second channel as it should be 			
as one one word a free channel then who would watch 			
Doordarshan 			
So they have to take a very gutsy decision 			
We are two words Doordarshan to open up a			
channel			
I don't know if any government do have the guts to do that in India			
today			
I a few words suggestion that the government			
channel state channel existing channel be extinguished 			
 Prasar Bharati will take over			
That will be there will be a transformation as far as All			
India Radio and Doordarshan are concerned 			
And then the other will be a private or competitive channel or			
channels 			
But who will watch it ?			
Who will watch uh Doordarshan when you have a			
private channel to compete ?			
Well let's ask Kuldeep and			
Then they will have to improve 			
Actually the analysis is if Doordarshan is			
just like what it is today nobody will switch it on 			
But uh if there is a private uh channel which is producing			
a better programme naturally Doordarshan will have to 			
produce better or not to see it 			
But George I don't know my feeling is ki 			
this whole thing is being confused purposely 			
I think the government does not want to impliment any 			
Prasar Bharati Bill 			
And the whole thing			
 A few words 			
 I'm sorry I'm sorry it's a mess			
now 			
So it the whole thing has been introduced just to delay			
 postpone things			
I don't think the government is serious about giving 			
control of this media in the hands of independent people uh though			
government control still states but state government is not willing to			
 part ways with that kind of authority			
Well let us presume that the idea is to go ahead			
 with the Prasar Bharati Act			
Though it's been very slow 			
Uh in the circumstances then how should we proceed 			
Now as a former Director General of All India Radio or			
Broadcasting what would you say 			
Well the first thing that government has to do is to			
invite legislation to set up its body an independent body which is			
going to assign frequently 			
 It's not the government that has it in a in few			
countries it is an independent body that does it 			
The next thing is to draw up the sort of priorities that you			
want of the alternative programmes that you think to 			
 of continuing 			
Yes it is 			
If the only alternative that you can think of is commercial 			
then probably uh uhm there may be trouble but I think it's 			
a mistake to suppose Madhu as you as I think you were making 			
Mainly that if uh a private channel comes or a			
commercial channel nobody will watch Doordarshan 			
one word or listen to All India Radio 			
Fact is that people thought that would happen to the B B C			
It didn't			
The B B C still does mm control a vast section of the			
audience			
So what's the loss 			
But they still do and we are still setting the standard for 			
for what ought to be insat doing 			
Now the question is on what basis do we allot channels ?			
But the the basic question is why count and			
change ?			
What do you want broadcasting to do in terms of what it is			
now and what it might be ?			
And what is the kind of change that you would envy in			
terms of the new order 			
Yes which we are thinking of uh a second channel 			
again in the hands of the people who are going to compete uh who are			
going to attract more listeners and viewers on the basis of 			
showing may be some films or programmes which is is really in that			
consumerism 			
Now my feeling is ke the purpose is partly			
lost 			
Consumerism would be end of what middle classes you say			
Yes definitely			
For example the ho how do			
we ensure in this country that uh this vast country where			
the people have certain other kind of ethos 			
How do we appeal to them ?			
Because if this second channel comes and it is competitive			
 as it should be 			
And if it is in the hands of some people who can afford it 			
then there aim would be to one word 			
 That's right			
 They're not very who are going to be worried			
about uh you can do it do it some programmes for the uplift of the people			
I think they may need more than two channels 			
Maybe third channel or may be fourth channel 			
Some channel given to the university some ch 			
 channel given to the people 			
Because the purpose I have in view is of course one view is			
 of course entertainment one word 			
But other way I think is we must do something for the			
uplift of the people 			
Use the TV use the whatever this medium is for			
uh fighting some prejudices 			
Right			
Like that			
Well let's ask Madhu here			
Well I think			
What kind of content would you have if you were to have			
 this opportunity ?			
I think uh I disaggre with Ku 			
Kuldeep in that			
But I don't think there is a hard line between uh social			
purpose uplift of the people and entertainment 			
I think that had been the problem with Doordarshan 			
 that it catagorised so strictly that either it's cheap vulgar			
entertainment or it is boring programmes for education which is so			
boring that nobody in the right mind can watch 			
I think that what has to be done is that there has to be a merger			
of the two an infertainment 			
And up uplift of people will			
come from people who want to watch programmes which is so interesting			
that they don't know whether they are being educated and their prejudices are			
being broken down 			
Things like that like uh uh the tragedy that took place in			
Sindhu recently where lower caste people have been uh butchered and			
put in gunny bags 			
I don't think that kind of film would be possible if an emotional			
beautiful film was made which made the higher caste people aware of			
the feelings			
And made the the lower caste mess anonymous to them			
I think the large part of it is the anonimity 			
So I think that all this I think that just making money making			
revenues is looked down upon 			
I don't think that so I think that making re 			
 revenue should be uh tied-up with the fact that you			
know that you can make money by doing things that will move people			
Right			
But we hear uh you are really talking about uh news 			
and uh daily affairs current affairs 			
What about extention education other things that are not really			
marketable ?			
Where would the money come from and what would it cost to put			
up such a channel such a network ?			
Because there is no scope in just of the metro or the larger			
cities or the country as a whole			
And we talk of people which are these people that we are			
talking about ?			
Where do they live ?			
What is their level of understanding ?			
What language do they understand ?			
 Is it is it English or is it all our			
fourteen schedule languages and numerous other unscheduled and tribal			
languages 			
Then don't you know that it is a major issue because what			
you are talking about the languages 			
If there is any say four or five privatisation is concerned if 			
they 			
Again time and again we have dealt with this problem and 			
 uhm and on radio I think you've you have got to do			
it			
 Uhm 			
But you have also to be interested in going			
outside the framework of All India Radio and and Doordarshan			
How would you address this problem which people what caste 			
how do you one word 			
You see uh a programme to uh not very well up and what			
the cost would be on television but I know that there would be some thing			
like ten times 			
Uh atleast ten times if not for uh for uh a one word 			
worth in capital and then the exenditure			
But take a small thing like one word radio 			
that is people are they are interested in each other they have			
common problem they come and participate they discuss their problem			
 then they go ahead and try to do something better 			
Now uh I mean the question is where does the money			
come from ?			
Well I think we really have to go out into the market to			
see where the money is and where it comes from 			
This opposition that people are not interested in uh a in			
anything but making money 			
Uh I think it's a mistake 			
There are any number of trust they're running			
hospitals 			
 They're doing various other things 			
If the said uh uh potential in radio and television			
 I'm sure they will come forward			
Now you told us about look up station video or radio 			
even otherwise 			
 We're talking about four five six crores			
 not more than that 			
But you know I'm talking of national hook-ups 			
When we're talking of hundreds of crores 			
 Kuldeep where do you think uh uh our options lie ?			
Because broadcasting has been very much talked down in the sense			
 we've national broadcasting then regional broadcasting local			
broadcasting in the sense is yet to come			
The communities 			
Now if you think of starting from the bottom then it			
becomes managable			
As you have said you have a hospital or you have a school or			
university people want to spend that			
Because the career teaching is that it needs it and			
 it's useful 			
Our teacher talking about current affairs talk			
 talking about you know since it is a very high			
level 			
Then one is really talking about films that may be a of of			
 of uh interest to high guard people to well educated			
people and to very weak 			
Otherwise we're talking to farmers simple people in			
their language 			
How would they manage this ?			
This is the question I'll ask to ask to Kuldeep and			
Madhu you also			
Because this is really were the boiling butter comes			
in 			
I think the idea of a local station is a very good idea			
I think it's been tried abroad 			
Uh and uh I think while Madhu was commenting on my uh 			
vocation that I one word counter view I one word I			
think Mr Madhu was missing one side of it and that is what I want			
to answer 			
And it is take for example the Mandal Commission			
 report 			
How many people really explained what it meant 			
Of course our TV picked up the stories that little boys were			
killed the boys were that			
But this look here this is wrong with the Hindu society			
 that here is a society which has not treated human beings as human being			
for thousands of years 			
Maybe this was the wrong idea to be the way it was done			
But was it exploited if these now stations are there 			
Maybe these were like small kinds of uh outlets 			
Maybe these are the places where we can drop again this thing			
because these are the people from below 			
These are the people at the grass roots and help them to			
overcome their prejudices			
Kuldeep I wanted to button there if I may			
And also doing one or two words what Madhu was speaking			
In a programme of that kind what is happening to people in			
different parts of India I think uh the important thing is not			
that you tell people who know about themselves			
But you tell others in different parts of the country that			
look this is how people are living in a certain part			
The network would be important			
And I think uh Madhu where I very much agree with you 			
there is enormous interest of people in other people 			
We know next to nothing but so many extremely interesting			
groups in our country and I think television could and radio			
could help the broadcast			
But can we do that ?			
Unless there is some kind of a right unless there is some			
kind of break up unless there is some vague one word nothing			
alse can work			
 In that way Kuldeep is one thing that nobody			
can disagree with the regional station			
I think that is the way that that India should go			
Because with that many languages I think it'll be			
crucial if we give uh local stations atleast a certain amount of 			
hours before the before the national hook-up 			
 One or to words 			
I think we're talking about explaining to people			
about why something like Mandal took place			
About the vote bank 			
I think that's their patronising 			
I think that I don't think we have to explain 			
I think what we have to do is to bring whatever is happening			
 to them and deal and and show that this is not this a channel 			
this is a person this is human being this is what's 			
happening 			
And I think I trust our people one word Indians			
 wherever we live in India that they will respond that they			
will feel that yes this is the child who had been hurt and this is the			
woman that had been raped this is the man that has suffered injustice			
 and I think people will really respond when we when we remove the			
anonimity that we have of each other instead of the formality and the			
distances 			
Which is something that our electronic media has done			
And when we see constantly you see on programmes people			
are fake they are artificial nobody talks like that they normally			
do in their life even the language is is not colloquial 			
We are here to discuss the priorities of the eighth Five			
Year Plan 			
The other day the national development council met and approved of			
the directional paper 			
Uh which is preceeding the actual meeting of the eighth plan			
Uh there used to be approach papers before every plan and as			
 an economist who also had a sense of humour once quipped about the			
fifth plan it's not the it's not the approach to the			
fifth plan but the fifth approach to the same plan 			
Emphasisng the similarity that exists in all our plans 			
Now one wonders whether it'll be different this time			
And to discuss such issues we're going to talk			
about whether the planning concept is still relevent into these world 			
and if so in what way is the eighth plan going to be different from			
the past plans 			
We are going to discuss I think the main thrusts of the			
eighth five year plan whatever they are and whatever the priority there			
may be 			
We are going to reflect on the size and the shape and the			
structure of the eighth plan 			
And finally I suppose the financing aspect where the resources			
are going to come uh to meet the needs of the plan 			
And while doing this major issues like budget deficits uh			
shortage of resources uh shortage of infrastructure and also the			
balance of payments questions all these will come up 			
May I first ask uh uh Dr Nitish Singh Sen Gupta who is with us			
 other then and he is the Secretary of the Planning Commission uh			
other then Dr Syed Hashim Raza who is Advisor in Perspective Planning			
in the Planning Commission and Dr uh Arvind Veermani uh who is			
Advisor in the Ministry of Finance 			
Uh it so happens that all of us uh are doctors here you know			
and as Alexander Pope once quipped who shall decide when			
doctors disagree 			
However let me ask uh Dr Nitish Sen Gupta whether he			
feel that the planning concept is still relevent today and could we think			
of the eighth plan as a a matter relevent to todays time and change			
circumstances 			
Well at a time when all over the world there is a			
general uh debunking of the concept of planning we feel that 			
planning is very relevent 			
Although it is another thing that any planning has to build on			
 the gains reached earlier by the previous plans and also draw on the			
development experience of declinations following different 			
 it's way slightly different routes 			
In our opinion planning is very relevent although it has to 			
shed off a lot of the past traditions 			
It has to acquire new traditions and new experience			
empirical knowledge so as to make it uh so as to acquire a new			
meaning 			
It is relevent 			
What do you think uh Dr Hashim Raza ?			
Uh the relevence of planning in our country is to be			
seen in the context of two very important and major areas uh			
where we need to keep on the developmental phase 			
One is the area of human development human resources which			
includes the development of taking care of the health by and			
large 			
Uh taking care of the education building up training 			
Uh along with the provision of certain uh items of minimum			
needs fulfilling the basic essential needs of the people in			
general 			
Now this is what public sector will have to take care of			
 particularly in a situation where large gaps still exist 			
In the need for the services these items public goods and			
 uh the provision which already exist 			
Another important area where I think planning will be			
 remain relevent in our country for quite a long time is the			
building up of infrastructure 			
This include energy it includes transport infrastructure			
communication uh and it also includes infrastructure like			
you know certain essential one word variations 			
Uh therefore in both of these two though in the later part 			
uh uh the eighth plan particularly welcomes the involvement of private sector			
wherever possible			
For example in energy private sector has been invited to take			
part			
Ah ha 			
But it's par 			
participation in the coming next few years will only be at			
the margin for private sector has to learn how to come in we've			
 to learn 			
But hasn't it learnt considerably in the last forty years 			
Uh I would like to ask Dr Veermani an in-view of this new			
trends towards privatization 			
Uh an in-view of the fact that uh the new policies of the			
government in this country too uh are talking of deregulations and			
decontrol and handing things over considerbly to the private sector			
Is there still some need for economic planning ?			
Uh yes certainly 			
Uh and I would like to add one more area uh which has been			
 uh not mention by Dr Hashim and that is the area of micro-management			
In some sense uh even countries which don't have uh			
planning in the sense that we have used this word uh still have to plan			
their micro-economy 			
And that is the area which will remain in a sense even after all			
these other three uh have passed the way 			
Then now let us come to the aspect on this and I would like to			
ask Dr Sen Gupta uh in what way is the eighth five year plan			
different from uh the past plan ?			
Are there any innovations that are peculiar to this plan and			
can we talk of it as a different entity compare to the past ?			
Eighth plan uh Prof Khushroo is different from the			
previous plans in quite a number of ways 			
As I said in the beginning it tries to build on the experience			
gained earlier 			
We are starting against the backdrop of very significant growth			
rate of five point five percent throughout the decade of the nineteen			
eightees and five point six percent during the seventh plan period			
Uhm uhm 			
Now so this on the at the same			
time because of our inprovidence in the recent past 			
 We've been subject to the need for this kind of rather 			
uh dramatic process of adjustment in our economy 			
 Which is which makes our task somewhat			
difficult			
Now this plan will seek to ma make			
 ta take the maximum gain out of the			
investment already made 			
It will be a plan for consolidation 			
It is time we give up the uh earlier race about necessarily			
making a plan bigger than the pa pre previous 			
 one in terms of allocation 			
It is time we give up accepting let us say five hundreds			
schemes when you've got resources to complete uh only about			
hundred schemes 			
It is time to uh give all attention to completing project some			
time			
So as to avoid time over run and cost over run 			
Again it is also time to give up this earlier uh uhm you know			
misplace priority on a number of things you know like for instance we give a			
lot of attention to running industry 			
Now government has given up uh vacated a large number of areas			
in industry hoping that private initiative will take over uhm 			
Then secondly uh let us say things like literacy and			
population control 			
Now sixth and seventh plan we practically gave up population			
control			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
Now it is now understood that if only if the all			
the growth that has taken place in the industry services agriculture if			
only we have been able to control our population growth to the rate			
achieved by let us say China 			
I think how much that el how much difference that alone			
would have made in part of the terms 			
Uhm			
Then secondly so today government will concentrate on			
infra-structure as Prof Hashim mentioned mainly transport 			
communication agriculture irrigation 			
Not so much on industry now except certain basic and heavy			
industry whose area also has been drastically reduced 			
Uhm uhm 			
Then we neglected social development very much 			
We give up a any attempt to achieve literacy 			
Uhm			
Now eighth plan will concentrate on achievement of literacy			
and universalization of primary education by the time the plan ends 			
And then vocationalizing scondary education 			
It will not give enough of direct governmental uh attention			
 uhm to higher education etcetera etcetera except to the			
extent necessary for upgrading the requirement 			
 Uhm 			
And there a lot will depend on uh utilizing private			
initiative to supplement government efforts 			
So many respectable governments role will be the role of			
 a facilitator for desirable activities 			
And doing tha taking direct			
action only in the infra-structure and only in social human			
development 			
So it appears that uh though there are important areas			
which planning will address uh even now 			
Uh there are other things which have to be done by other sectors of			
the economy 			
The private sector also would have something to do with it 			
Uh Dr Hashim do you fe feel 			
that there are innovations in this plan other than what Dr Sen Gupta has			
mention			
Uh Prof Khushroo I will suppliment what Dr Nitish Sen			
Gupta has said 			
By emphasising one aspect of approach to this plan 			
in contrast with the earlier plan is that this plan very			
prominently relies on the involvement of people for achieving a number of			
things			
Ah ha 			
Which earlier was thought to be achieved just by an outlet			
 by financial expenditure			
Ah ha 			
It is very explicitly recognized in this document that			
it is not the financial expenditure that can achieve everything			
In fact in course of time expenditure has diminishing			
return in terms of its effectiveness in achieving target			
Ah			
And therefore involvement of people which brings you			
to the development of rural institutions ah the proper			
institutions uh a phrase which was used in the second five year plan			
 I think is becoming much more relevent now developing			
institutions adequate to the needs of the people 			
And that will be one of the very important I feel 			
This plan this plan for the first time talks of indicative			
planning			
 Ah 			
Ah ha 			
Infact in India we had a mix 			
mixture of indicative planning as well as direct planing of			
investment and targets in certain areas of public sector 			
Uh our achivements of indicative planing can be seen in the sector			
of agriculture 			
Uhm			
Where the production is done by millions of farmers 			
and yet when the sixth food grain target when we decided that we have			
to become self-sufficient in food-grain production 			
We took a number of steps indirect steps by way of creating			
infra-structure by way way of way of a			
package of policies including controlling prices and of stocking 			
And to which we were able to achieve agricultural target 			
Now we will be paying a little more attention to the			
instrument and the methods of indicative planning and in large area			
widen the area of indicative planning 			
So this will be another 			
Now uh I notice that we have had a series of plan in			
this country 			
Every plan has had a huge budget deficit 			
Uh there has been a shortage of resources from taxation and			
borrowing 			
And therefore borrowing from abroad and particularly borrowing			
from the Reserve Bank of India has been the order of			
the day that has let to all kinds of uh inflationary pressures in the			
economy 			
And the story of Indian planning generally is a story of inflation			
It also is a story of balance of payment deficit partly for			
the same reason that the domestic economy has been inflated and			
exports were not released from the domestic economy considerably 			
Uh Dr Veermani uh would you say that there are some new			
things that there is some new thinking or some innovations in the 			
in the area of budget deficit management and in the area of balance of			
payments management in this plan 			
Yeah let me uh uh just give couple of examples where I			
think of genuine effort has been made uh to take account of the			
resource constraint 			
As the popular expression is to cut your coat to to fit			
the cloth 			
Uh one uh both things have been mentioned by secretary of			
planning 			
Uh one is the area of social expenditure where uh the focus is			
on realistic and achievable targets rather than spreading the money uh			
too far and wide and not achieving uh specially ta 			
 targets like literacy population control and so on 			
And second is in the area of infra-structure where if one may			
put it a little strongly uh earlier government may have had a kind of 			
uh dog and the manger attitude that uh they said that everything had			
to be done by the government and if the gap could not be closed it was			
postponed indefinately sometimes for decades 			
Uh the attitude now is that if we can not do it uh let us			
uh have the private sector do it			
So that the goals are achieved 			
Uh so this is basically is a reflection for this attempt			
 uh to take account of this resource constraints 			
Uh I would like to add one kind of word of caution in a sense 			
uh because there are still assumptions uh in the plan that public			
savings uh the adverse tre trends 			
which have marked the the short decade would			
in a sense be reversed and the public saving performance would be			
improved 			
I think that is critical uh to the plan and perhaps later			
on we can discuss in what ways that may be achieved 			
Thank you very much			
Now I would like to come to the area of the main			
thrust of the eighth five year plan 			
What are the sectors which are being regarded as the priority			
sectors ?			
What are the areas of achievements which are being uh regarded			
as uh thrust areas ?			
If you were to order priorities what would be the list of these			
your priorities Dr Sen Gupta ?			
I will give this priorities but they would not necessarily be			
 in terms of one two three and four			
Yeah			
Now agriculture for instance the idea is to carry the			
 Green Revolution from the North of India where			
it has been very much uh manifest to those areas parts of the country			
where it has not reach reached before 			
And secondly to use agriculture to build up exportable surplus			
The plan assumes that Indian agriculture has tremendous capacity			
and elasticity about uh to create providing a surplus which can			
be used to meet the requirement of other parts of the world			
And also to keep us a valuable balance of payments support 			
Then population I've already elaborated on the			
importance			
But the idea is that the crude birth rate should be			
brought down from thirty point four per thousand till to about twenty			
point uh six by the end of the uh seventh five year plan			
And the growth rate of population will automatically come down			
from uh two point one percent which it is at present to about one point			
eight percent 			
We still have to go to achieve the rate which China has achieved			
And you can see what how China has progressed in terms of economic			
development 			
Then poverty alleviation in general especially by			
concentrating on the rural areas and on the urban property 			
 poverty 			
And then employment the plan promises to create ten million			
jobs a year 			
And hoping that uh by that by the end of the century with all			
the problems of all the problems of education all that we'll be			
able to largely solve the unemployment problem 			
Then literacy 			
Literacy because that is very important and we propose to uh			
achieve full literacy by the end of this century 			
By concentrative attention 			
Then coming to infra-structure well roads have to be given			
importance communication has to be given importance and irrigation			
has to be given importance and energy 			
But irrigation again there is a kind of idea to switch on from			
 the earlier exessive concentration on big project 			
Recovering a lo involving a long gestation uh			
period and a lot of resources on to medium and smaller size 			
irrigation projects which can be applied very sort of operative 			
implimentated march more quickly 			
So uh and then uh of course irri uh energy of course			
is very important because if we cannot uh have proper electricity of			
the one word proper mix of hydel and thermal practically all			
development will come to a stop 			
But there the problem of resources come in			
Dr Sen Gupta I I did feel that bringing the the ambition			
and the aim of bringing the growth rate of popula no not the growth			
rate 			
 The the the the fertility rate or the			
birth rate of population from thirty per thousand to twenty per thousand			
within a five year period is a is a I think a pipe dream really 			
There are ten days to go and then we will witness the			
elections in Punjab which perhaps are going to be the most difficult 			
ever held in this country 			
 It's not known how many people will or will feel			
free to come and participate in them 			
Uh what kind of uh state of disturbance there might or			
might not be 			
And therefore what kind of value should one attach to this			
exercise ?			
What does it hold in in the in terms of			
the future of Punjab ?			
These are some of the questions which uh I'm going to			
explore this evening with a group of very experienced observers of the			
scene 			
On my immediate left is Mr Prem Bhatia chief editor of the			
 Tribune at on time 			
Khuswant Singh probably the best known non-political			
Punjabi I would say laughter 			
And Mr Girilal Jain formerly chief editor of the 			
 Times of India 			
I know it's a difficult question to answer 			
We can only guess 			
But let me invite your best guess estimate 			
On first of all the very crucial question do you think that uh 			
it will be an election which will hold meaning in the sense that a			
substantial proportion of people will come forward to participate in them			
 ?			
And I mean I think thereafter it would be necessary for us to			
look into the question what is it that can be done between now and			
the day of polling which would possibly improves the chances of a			
higher voter turn-out ?			
Prem would you like to have the first shot at it ?			
Well the reaction public reaction at the moment 			
and that is fairly good criterion of uh making an assessment			
The public reaction is a mixture of despair cynicism 			
and some hope 			
I I I'll suggest let's go into the reasons			
later but give your short answers first put your uh what shall			
you say your guess on the table 			
When we'll explore it the guess about the future			
 about the participation level Punjab has been known for a very high			
percentage of voting in the past 			
Never less than sixty percent 			
Yeah sixty-seven 			
Never less than sixty at the worst of times			
 Ah 			
Well I would be a great optimistic if I would say sixty			
percent are going to turn-out 			
My own guess would be closer to thirty 			
And I think we'll be lucky if we get thirty percent 			
Ah ha 			
Well my ques answer won't			
be as brief because I've just been looking at the 			
 I'll I give you a second by to the 			
one word later			
 To record 			
Yeah			
 What's your pretty guess			
I you know it's not as easy as that			
I I as Prem said that uh Punjab has a uh a very good record			
of large turn-out			
Yes 			
Uh the lowest has been sixty seventy percent when a			
boycott has been called in the past 			
Uh this time I'm not sure the boycott is being called			
again 			
But I I the general impression as I've seen is that if			
 the polling is above sixty percent it will be regarded as a success			
If it is between forty to fifty percent it's a			
draw 			
And if it is under forty percent then the boycotters will have			
that uh			
 Would you would you have a little			
range in mind			
 Do you do you think how far 			
 how far up and how far down it should be ?			
I I think you be don't wish to make one or two			
words 			
 Would not like to make a guess 			
Giri would you speak what you make out			
If it is one-third uhm if it is around			
thirty-five percent yes I would regard it as a success 			
 even 			
 Uhm 			
 Yes 			
 Would you would you expect thirty-five percent			
 ?			
Do you think it will be ?			
I don't think it will be 			
It would be closer to thirty than to thirty-five in my opinion			
Perhaps very precise guess somewhere between thirty and			
thirty-five is really making it very precise 			
I want to address uh one question to you in this very question			
our level of participation			
You know the Assam election where the percentage of voter			
turn-out much lower four percent yeah to be exact			
 Much lower 			
 Yeah 			
People have been saying uh what is the use of an election			
like that 			
Whatever the voter turn-out actually may happen to be			
 I think it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that this			
voter turn-out would have occured inspite of the extensive fear of			
violence 			
In Assam there was no such fear at all 			
A J P had not held out any threat 			
But people were not inclined to vote 			
They were not with the election and therefore the four percent			
voter turn- out was a clear indication of what their political opinion			
was 			
In the present case I would say that the low turn-out or not in my			
view be regarded as a rejection of the political process because			
there would be an element in it of fear of voting rather than a			
 an aversion to vote 			
Would you agree on that assessment of the political weight of			
whatever the figure might turn-out to be			
I think it's suppose fear of voting 			
They don't want to be killed maimed for life 			
And the other things is I think there is I said earlier a			
touch of cynicism 			
What will happen people say now supposing an elec			
 an election takes place 			
Uh attempts were made to form a government 			
Where is it going to lead us ?			
What would the government pe people			
 think in those terms 			
And therefore as I said this element of despair the voter 			
potential voter is not sure whether this election is going to lead			
anywhere 			
That is the dominant mood today			
Yeah but uh votes have not on the other hand become			
 if people were to free to vote 			
Vote for that itself become a reason 			
While they would go out to vote to make sure that it does lead			
somewhere that it doesn't lead the electoral process and therefore			
the future of Punjab hanging 			
If on the other hand it were cynicism without the			
enforcement of a boycott by fear then it would be a different picture			
Kushwant ?			
Well I think there is one thing which complicates the			
situation			
The Punjab in which I think you must bear in mind because			
the problem of the Punjab in very roughly put is the problem of			
the Sikhs 			
And I think it's more important to bear in mind what			
proportion of Sikh electorate go to the poll 			
 What voters go 			
And the the may simple way of			
looking at it is the urban and the rural voting for the Sikh is			
largely rural the Hindu is largely urban			
Uh and the there is no doubt that in cities Ludhiana			
 Jalandhar Amritsar there is likely to be larger turn- out 			
because the Hindu presence is there much larger 			
Than probably we uh smaller turn-out in the rural 			
 ar areas 			
 Rural areas 			
And uh we should watch and analyse that mood 			
to find out whether there is any substance whether the so called			
grievances of the Sikhs which the Akali's have			
been talking about the terrorist have been talking about 			
whether they've really gone down to the people themselves 			
 One or two word uh since you are willing to speculate			
 I am glad you do 			
Would you say that the greater disincentive to voter			
participation among the Sikhs would you say that the greater			
disincentive is going to be cynicism disinterest or fear 			
Well I expect it would be a combination of the three and I			
think the the situation will vary from area to area 			
Uh you take the three old traditional divisions of the Punjab			
 Maza Malwa and Doab			
The largest group is in Malwa where I think the turn-out will			
be there			
All because one or two words it's a			
prosperous area as a green belt uh area			
And we already had people like uh Amandar Singh being elected			
 One or two words 			
Yeah yeah 			
And of course where the terrorist are more active the			
Maza Gu Gurdaspur Amritsar 			
Kapurthala in the Doab area uh there the turn-out will inevitably be			
less			
Because the fear of the terrorist is much more there 			
Giri uh since you came down to a very precise prediction			
 let's assume for the sake of argument that something like			
thirty percent plus voter turn-out takes place 			
Taking into account that the voter turn-out is only thirty percent			
 taking into account if Khuswant's fear turn-out fears turn out			
to be true that the voter turn out among the Sikhs may be lower and only			
the total may be thirty percent 			
What you think should be the attitude of uh the rest of the			
country or government of India you might say ?			
To a government that would be formed as a result of that			
election would you regard it as a legitimate government ?			
You see this is this election 			
 is an act of desperation			
Uhm 			
The government of India has decided to go in for elections			
 because nothing else has worked 			
Yes 			
The government of India knows that the law under			
situation is far from what it should be for elections to be held			
properly 			
We all know it 			
It is also obvious that the threat is much more acute in			
 dispersed rural areas than in large cities 			
Yeah 			
 It's much easier to protect people in cities			
than in rural areas 			
So the fear element will be much stronger in the countryside			
 than in the larger urban centres 			
The Hindu-Sikh problem is a fact which can not be			
disregarded 			
And if the Sikh turn out I mean Sikhs are concentrated in the			
rural areas and if their turn-out is smaller than in the cities 			
than to that election to that extent the election result will be 			
not so helpful 			
But there is no option now			
There is no option and 			
And the government that result from it should be			
regarded as legitimate 			
Alright			
Only I would add one thing that if the 			
that that government must be very sensitive to the reality of			
the situation in Punjab 			
Sure 			
I I want to suggest one yardstick for guessing 			
how much of the voter abstention is on account of fear ?			
And how much on account of aversion ?			
The very fact that there are threats being held out that			
 if you vote we'll kill you indicates that			
in the minds of those who are holding out the threats there is a			
recognition that in the absence of the threat people will vote 			
That it is not so if if they were convinced that people are so			
cynical that they will not go to vote any how it would not be			
necessary to prevent them with threats			
And I go back to the example of the A J P in Assam 			
A J P held out no such threat of the kind 			
 It's position was known that we do not like these			
elections they are not fair elections and we will boycott them 			
There after they left it to the judgement of the people because			
they knew that the people were with them 			
Is it not the case than Prem that the element of fear is the			
predominant deterrent and not either cynisism or uncertainity about			
what the elections will produce 			
Uh I don't know whether if one can measure it in precise			
terms 			
But uh I would I would like to say			
that another element which comes from uh the present attitude that			
belong to the present attitude is one of sulk 			
Uhm			
Now I don't think that the population at large the Sikhs			
 I mean you have put your finger on the pulse of the uh the			
temper of the State 			
Among the Sikhs even among the Sikhs this sulking element 			
is not as large among the masses as among the leaders 			
The Sikh population is not sulking 			
They are unhappy they are cynical to the extent that they			
don't think much is going to come out of it 			
But I think down in their hearts they think it's 			
worth trying 			
They are fed up with the negative state of things 			
And uh they don't go into the technicalities of uh 			
elections like you I do 			
But there is uh heaven's sake get us out of this mess			
Yeah 			
And if this is the only way alright we would like to vote			
There is the element of fear 			
But then I think some of them turn back and say well			
what than is going to come out of it 			
So there are these two conflicts			
Uh I			
As Pran told at the last election we had the same threats 			
 yeah and yet the turn out was over fifty-seven few			
words 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah I think first of all 			
Which last election ?			
Both the Parliamentary and the Assembly yeah there			
was a large turn-out 			
 One or two words 			
 Eighty-five eighty-nine both of them			
 Eighty-five eighty-nine 			
They defied the threats just went to vote 			
No no I have			
Eighty-nine parliamentary elections uhm and			
the uh eighty-five uh uh assembly election			
 Uhm 			
At eighty-five the voters turn-out 			
At eighty-five it isn't but eighty-nine parliamentary elections			
 uhm the voter turn-out was sixty to present plus			
 Uhm 			
I never do			
Sixty-two point seven in nineteen eighty-nine you had the			
parliamentary in the assembly sixty-seven point five			
That was in eighty-five 			
 That's right and it's never been 			
 really al 			
 Are you are you 			
 would you would you say that the same kind of			
eagerness to vote would surface if there was not the fear of the			
gun ?			
I somehow think that we are exaggerating the fear of the gun			
if they have done voted in the past uhm despite a fear of			
the gun 			
 Uhm 			
A bigger element is a kind of indifference it makes			
you know whether if this fellow gets or that fellow gets and we'll			
 get nothing out of them 			
Uh and I think you have to also if there is a sort of			
disillusionment with the government there is probably a bigger			
disillusionment with the Akali factions 			
Yeah 			
And whether the Akali's called			
for a boycott or not it doesn't matter 			
Uh people are would I have got thoroughly fed up of there			
 in infighting and factionalism			
And therefore I have been different whether Akali			
 this wins or Akali that wins 			
 India's too graphic population growth is			
like a subterranian under current 			
Too many of the tensions that are surfacing in Indian society today			
But not a chronic ailment that one learns to live with 			
The issue has ceased to be upfront in the national debate 			
And in fact because unless this is addressed uh much			
else that we do for our developmental efforts does not justify 			
Uh welcome break therefore in today's 			
Focus in the wake of the World Population Day 			
That brings together three veterans of the population game			
 into the studio for a discussion with us 			
Uh we have here today Dr Karan Singh who lead the			
Indian delegation at the first World Population Conference in nineteen			
seventy-four 			
And gave the world the major of those one word development			
is the best contraceptive 			
Although now I believe he is on record saying that			
contraception is a best form of develpoment			
But I'm sure you will hear more about that from			
him later 			
Then there is Dr Bose a Jawaharlal Nehru fellow and an			
evergreen of commentator of the population in many other			
issues 			
And finally Dr Mathur who is the bureaucrat in the hot			
seat as a secretary with the Department of Family Welfare 			
But first before we turn the floor over for a free 			
participation of everybody for a discussion on this issue for the			
last one year now a population policy has been on the anvil 			
The eighth plan which has been approved in May has given			
 priority to the population issue 			
But at the same time while giving priority it has 			
down-scaled birth rate target even though one positive scene in all			
this dismal scenario has been that of late birth rates are dropping 			
But the eighth plan has scaled down to birth rate of only			
twenty-six for the year nineteen ninety seven 			
Why is this happening ?			
Or perhaps I should stop at this point and ask Dr Karan			
Singh who has spearheaded this programme with very critical			
 point in the programme 			
To give his comment on uh where we are ?			
And where do you think we are going where you see we can go ?			
Well the uh theme we are about discussion 			
to discuss is uh Population: Whithered India 			
And I have uh two word response to that two word question 			
And the response is towards disaster 			
Because uh what has happened in the last forty year 			
 years uh the increase of five hundred million people 			
The population of India from the nineteen fifty-one to the			
nineteen ninety-one census is something which is absolutely staggering			
It has diluted to a very large extent the considerable uh			
economic development that took place 			
As a result of which we are going into the twenty-first century			
 with more people below the poverty line then when we became free in			
nineteen forty-seven 			
More people not a larger proportion of the population but in			
absolute term more people 			
Our cities are exploding into slums they are like cancer			
growth eating into the countryside 			
Uh the whole social structure and fabric is beginning to collapse			
 under the sheer pressure of number 			
There is urbanization there is deforestation there is uh			
 defoliation the environment is being destroyed 			
And I would say that we are in a disastrous situation 			
Now what can be done about it ?			
I was very surprise to hear you say that uh a 			
the population policy is on the anvil 			
We must have a very hot anvil you know because in nineteen			
hundred and seventy-six I presented a national population policy to			
parliament which was accepted			
Now that is sixteen years ago 			
If the anvil is still growing I think we should let the			
representatives of the government of India enlighten us that what exactly			
has happen happened 			
Mr Mathur right			
Would you tell us why is it that it is necessary to tell the			
working on the population policy ?			
But also I would like you to comment on what is would			
you think feasible to be done in the near future within this decade ?			
And what are the strategies that you are forging and are			
you getting the support if you think you need ?			
Well while I entirely agree with Dr Karan Singh that it's			
 a disastrous uh situation 			
But whither India well whether we can save the disaster or			
not would depend what we do in the next ten years 			
And therefore we have very uh manfully taken the challenge			
 uh should say atleast in the de our department			
 to see how what we can do about it			
And in the last one year first of all we've made 			
uh concerted efforts 			
Now again focus attention on the population problem through			
very close interaction between India's one word we			
have been I think uh instrumental in uh increasing the awareness			
about the whole problem			
We are finding a lot of interest now in ordinary people			
also to participate in the whole thing 			
Then we have projected at least don't create 			
family welfare programme with the population control programme 			
When population control is a much larger concept 			
Family welfare of course is a key aspect of it 			
For population control is dependent on female literacy 			
education rural devepolment uh age of marriage of girls 			
So for that you must have a micro-level coordinated policy 			
Now I'm very glad that there was a policy as Dr Karan			
Singh has had mentioned earlier a National Population Policy 			
But that all had to be uh made into implementation plan and			
there had to be a uh micro-level mechanism also to have a			
co-ordinated implementation action 			
Now because of that now the N D C has appointed a committee of			
 N N D C on population which is going into the whole question on			
micro-level co-ordination 			
And as far as the a family welfare factor is concerned we			
have prepared a very result oriented and purpose one word plan			
 giving emphasis or improving of the quality or the self 			
family welfare services the health services constant one word 			
attention of the urban slums			
Dr Karan Singh has spoke spoken about			
 improving the quality of contraceptive introducing new contraceptive			
 social marketing better information communication education 			
na uh ta strategies ivolvement of people N G O			
What specific measure that improve endeavoury of			
services which is your one or two words 			
 That maternal 			
Uh well you see on that a lot of it is going to be			
the advent state of input 			
And training will play a key role 			
Now we have through very close interaction with the state			
government particularly the state government from these four mega			
states of North U P Bihar Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and to an			
extent Orissa and uh Assam where the problem is uh aggrieving 			
We have brought home the need for improving the delivering			
system			
So we are having certain special projects one word 			
infrastructure great emphasis being made lead on the uh training			
programme filling up of portio			
These are the nitty gritty details of good administration which			
makes all the difference 			
And then of course we're having very close monitoring what			
they do ?			
Yes greater enthusiasm 			
And then we have got this what you called uh ninety			
district strategy that is focussing on the ninety worst state of which			
eighty-three are in the four state 			
So I have a			
 One word taken up already 			
Well the beginning have been made			
We are awaiting uh the micro-plan from the individual district			
 because we do not want to impose anything from above 			
So we have told the State Government please involve			
your local people your collector your uh chief medical officer			
 			
And they from the local condition send us micro-plan which			
would indicate their special support is required from the Center 			
So that uh the democracy profile improves in those states 			
And then of course I I was mentioning a very great emphasis			
 on maternal and child health area you see 			
We are just about to launch a very important 			
child survival and safe motherhood project which uh through an			
integrated have been to mention for child survival and for promotion			
of safe motherhood practices 			
It reduce infant mortality child mortality and maternal			
mortality 			
And people will then appreciate that uh if you 			
 your their children are going to survive they need			
not have launched up 			
Ashish I'm wondering what you have to say on all			
this			
I can al al almost see you it			
looks coining a new acronym no no right now			
 No no 			
I will make two brief comments at the outset 			
First what Dr Karan Singh's relation to the			
National Population Policy 			
I think it is too late in the day now as nineteen ninety-two to			
 think of again formulating a national population policy			
 I've just done a preliminary analysis of the nineteen			
ninety-one census data 			
And one thing which emerges gre is a great diversity			
of India 			
And you can't put all these states and districts in one			
package 			
And therefore the national population policy tends to be a set			
of platitudes 			
And it has very little operational value 			
In any case we've miss the bus			
We should have done it right in the First Five Year Plan 			
Now Dr Karan Singh the only snag uh you would forgive me for			
saying that only snag about the national population policy formulated by			
him 			
Well this was emergency and it became highly unpopular 			
because there was one permissive clause 			
I don't remember the particular section or the dialogue 			
which saying that some state government wants to introduce compulsory			
sterilization then we do so 			
If they have the way they've resolve and that landed			
 the government in very serious trouble 			
And as you know the very next year the Janata Government withdrew			
that policy 			
The only thing common in their next year's policy was			
 this fielding of the electorate the parliamentary assembly seat			
in nineteen seventy-one upto two thousand one			
That is a very good step I suppose that			
In fact there was very serious severe setbacks to			
the a few words 			
 A few words 			
So let's not get back into history			
The thing is as we are now if we are still waiting even after			
formulating the eighth five year plan for a national population policy			
 then I think we are lost 			
And we're heading towards disaster as he say 			
And it is time that we forget this sort of a generalizing 			
and comes out to grasp that another plan of action 			
Now which brings me my second point 			
Now there if I mentioned so my differenc to the ministry's			
 plan of action is those ninety districts which you have identified			
 they are truely backward 			
In fact in my analysis on nineteen ninety-one census I get one			
hundred and fifteen districts 			
Any other noble mind you told me that you can also change uh			
 dedicated the act to that resolve			
 That's not my point			
My point is if you put more money on familiy palanning in			
those districts you will not succeed because there the birth			
rates are high precisely because infra-structure is not there 			
The roads are not there 			
These hospitals are not functioning sub-centre's are			
not fuctioning staff is not there			
 Yeah 			
And there are number of other social indicators are in here			
backward whether it being marriage whether it is child labour			
whether it is			
 All the other one or two words 			
Yeah therefore I would say			
High maternal mortality			
That you should not spread the butterfield 			
You should not waste your resources family planning's			
 limited resources on giving a backup in those districts where the			
infra-structure has to be laid first 			
So in my scheme of things in my my 			
strategy which I'm going to formulate shortly I would support			
the thickly populated densely populated advanced districts 			
We should give the lead to the country 			
For Example the urban birth rate must be drastically cut down 			
 I I it's a shame that			
 in the urban areas the birth rate is so very high 			
One of the reason of course is the large slum population to which			
Dr Karan Singh referred 			
So but uh the strategy of putting your money in a			
backward districts for family planning back-up I really have reserves			
 But uh 			
But why you have a valid point about doing something			
about the urban slums definitely need the full pace 			
But seventy-five percent of India is in still in the			
rural areas and within that seventy-five percent of those really			
needing the services now are identified to be those that are religious with			
relation to two thousand population			
Yes more settlement			
There is uh settlement			
Yes yes that makes the task more difficult 			
 So 			
So therefore the ninety district strategy either a few			
words we can have little discussion on this			
Actually what you feel is that the two things are not			
mutually extreme			
Yeah 			
We are focussing on urban slums 			
We realize that these are also neglected area			
And when you if you strengthen the infrastructure you put a			
little bit push you can have the results 			
So city by city we are making a plan to how to			
strengthen the infrastructure			
We have taken four cities including Delhi Calcutta 			
Hyderabad and Bangalore in the first phase 			
Other uh municipal commissioners and the state 			
government's have been asked to have their own plans			
Because you see unless the local authorities are involve in			
the planning process then they don't own the fact 			
And then we get a totally inattitude uh idea of what is to be done			
So we are awaiting that and I and yes will 			
definitely we will cover all the ninety cities in the first phase			
But ninety district uh strategies we have to go along			
otherwise those districts will be far behind			
 I'll come back on the ninety districts			
 One or two words can I say something one or two			
things I would like to say of this			
Firstly uh if you are going to wait for micro-plans to be			
need and come up to you before you formulate your new policy 			
That reminds me of the famous verse by Galib hum			
ne mana ke tagaful na karoge lekin khak ho jayenge hum tum ko khabar hone			
tak 			
By the time you uh you develop your laughter one			
or two words you will see these micro- plan you know the country is			
already uh uh virtually drowning in an ocean of of 			
 of people			
So my submission would be that there must be a sense of			
urgency about it 			
And I do agree that having been in exile for fourteen years			
like Shri Ram from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen			
ninety-one fourteen years family planning was in exile laughter 			
It became a dirty word they even change the name of the ministry			
 and mind you the alibis I've been two words I don't			
want to get into controversy 			
But just because in one of the eighteen paragraph there was a			
mention an enabling mention of the possibility of some state passing 			
laws which were never pass that is not an alibi for having dished the			
entire population policy which included uh contraceptive technology is			
included female literacy it included a lot of worthwhile			
Including you increase the age of marriage 			
A few weeks ago we didn't know about plague 			
Now it's here 			
We don't know whether it's here to stay or going to			
vanish 			
What I learnt and most of us here today learnt that			
this was eradicated in nineteen fifty-six but it has resurfaced after			
twenty-eight years 			
 Most of most people of my generation			
today think that it had just occured way back in 			
at the end of the last century and over twelve point five million people			
had died 			
But now it is again here			
There is total confusion			
 It's spreading 			
There is panic 			
 We've a panel of eminent doctors here today to			
discuss the cause and the cure			
To know whether it is going to stay or be controlled 			
Now let me introduce the panel to you 			
To the extreme left is Dr B Chakravarty 			
He is medical suprintendent of the Safdar Jung hospital here 			
Next to him is Dr Ashok Rattan from the All India Institute			
of Medical Sciences and just next to me is Dr K K Dutta Director of			
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases 			
Now we'll like to know from Dr Dutta that 			
this disease we everybody thought that it has been eradicated how it			
has come back ?			
Actually plague is is known to			
be associated uh with uh epidemic not only epidemic two word			
So the plague means epidemic plague means one word 			
It is not true that uh we've been able to eradicate plague			
 uh though the last human case of plague is in nineteen 			
in India is nineteen fifty-six 			
But what we've told that you know after nineteen fifty-six			
we we don't have a evidence I mean confirmed evidence of human plague			
But we've uh the evidence of uh rodent inflicting			
disease 			
To know that the rats were a few words 			
Now one of the importance one word which covered safety			
 in Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Karnataka a few words 			
because two words see adjoining areas anymore 			
Another important focus is Maharashtra another one word			
 Himachal Pradesh 			
You know we had focus site in in Madhya Pradesh uhm uhm and			
some other areas 			
But basically a few words is existing in India 			
It continues to live in India 			
And plague is known to come inside 			
And how what is the e one word period what			
is there you know it could be in decade it could be few years 			
And nobody knows exactly 			
And not only it resurfaced in India it has resurfaced in many other			
countries also 			
As I'm one word even in nineteen ninety-two was			
this organisation has reported plague human plague from nine countries			
So is it here to stay now ?			
 What do you what do the N I C 			
 say ?			
 I'll not say that it is going to stay because the			
human plague uh would be definitely brought under control 			
And uh once the human plague is in district occurred			
 it was sympton that there is a need for a continous monitoring of the			
situation 			
We know that we've uh a plague surveillance in the			
National Institute of Communicable Disease at Bangalore which insisted			
there is some violence I don't know if they control measure for			
plague in the in the adjoining cities 			
We had another even if they uh uhm I mean uhm I a few words			
 one unit was working in Maharashtra 			
Uh but as that ceased to function after nineteen eighty-seven 			
Though uh from the National Institute of Communicable Disease			
we can see the focal point for uh plague uh monitoring 			
 We've warned actually we've told them that			
the that the plague control is continue to policy of the power in India 			
It was also recomended the last uh inter-state			
co-ordination committee meeting which was held in nineteen ninety-three			
I strongly remember sell when it was sell that the plague			
 contrareversal contra repulsion of the a few words because			
if you said a few words we do not know what is happening in the			
 in the one word 			
Because uh we don't have any picture uh uh what is happening uh			
But did we know that uh it has it can occur in India ?			
Yes because the plague is known to occur in cycle 			
As we've been			
No because you see when we first heard from date that			
was on September fourteenth			
And four plague cases were detected in Beed 			
It was dismissed 			
In the respective states government said it is not 			
Even N I C D said there was nothing 			
And all of a sudden some four five days later we heard from			
Surat that people are dying there 			
People are running away 			
 That's not true			
 That's not one word communicable disease actually			
Confirmed to the the organisation of plague in Beed 			
Actually the the first uh the the reported thing of of the			
clinical one word which occurred in one word that			
was on twenty-sixth of August 			
Then they've you know the delegates of this planning of			
Beed district then they approached the local medical college			
They came they saw even most of the doctors have not seen a			
case of plague 			
They saw the cases			
They collected some critical material a few words 			
They collected uh some rat also which was sent to the Haffkin			
institute 			
And and the local medical college they declared it's 			
not a case of plague 			
But thesis continue to to uh to occur 			
And not only that the rat fall also continued to occur 			
Then uh uhm they asked our help then they actually I got a			
telephonic message from from uhm uhm from joined director of two			
words on second of September that uh they want uh one			
assistant in where in understanding the problem			
And that they detected as early as September 			
So second September immedietly I requested them you send the			
 some of sample which you've collected			
They suspected four cases 			
They collected four set of samples and has been			
Uh uh how did that one word 			
So that I kept the two words 			
We told them that the uh it is uh you send uh 			
We informed them that there is positive for plague on sixth 			
And immediately they started distributing the contraband 			
But in the Beed one word what has happened they took very			
good anti-plague measure then uh then one word exchange house			
to house salvage			
So the situation was coming under control 			
But unfortunately there is something you know which occured you			
know first confirmation it came to us it was on twentieth of September			
 We've some couple of cases and I			
Excuse me Dr Dutta			
Yeah 			
Can I ask you one question			
Yeah 			
Have you has the frequent relation with an earthquake 			
because it has occured about the earthquake 			
Can you explain it whe whe whether 			
 it has one or two words 			
Actually you know when the last earthquake when this			
earthquake occured in Latur our investigative team that's not it			
was only one team			
Our team went there			
We can held the one word 			
And we made the a a forecast			
That forecast in the sense that we told them that because this			
particular their case is is unknown of one word focal			
There may be focal one word there			
Idea struck like focus was there and now because of the			
earthquake because of echo disturbence that've occured this one			
word will start migrating in different directions 			
So keep a watch on this			
And I would we'll not be surprised that we gain certainly			
But that is not there is rodant uh uh plague and infections how			
could in few word domestic area and human being affected			
We made them 			
Not only we told them in our report we also published in in the			
science section 			
 Accha 			
Should I try to put it in one word 			
 Yeah doctor 			
See uhm plague is a disease of the rodant 			
And it is transmitted from rodant to another rodant through			
fleece 			
Man is not required for it's transmission 			
And uh in the world you would find that fossil of plague are			
present uh in America and they are present in U S S R and they			
are present in other country 			
And uh it's also present in India			
So it's there that man is not required for the			
transmission 			
 It's uh a disease of the rodant which is carried			
from one rodant to another rodant through the fleece and it's 			
been there are some disturbances when they fell over it's like			
uh the milk boiling over that the plague infects a man			
 To aap ke kahne ka matlab hai ke matlab jo khet			
ka chuha hai woh usse phailta hai it's not ke			
aadmi aadmi se plague phailta hai 			
What is it that we talk about bubonic plague ?			
So that's what I would like to tell			
about the			
 One or two words 			
Yeah Dr Rattan			
So what Dr has told about is very correct 			
It is basically a disease of rodant 			
Man is an incidental bit 			
But suppose a variety of well uh this uh disease have all			
other one word a plague suppose a bubonic type of			
plague where the all the plague has occured uh which is uh 			
develop one word uh there is a fact it has larva 			
and it has develop demand at this time man can one word into			
the one word because by near about the drop in infection			
Becomes rather sick so the bacteria are being stored as a			
support which it nearly get			
It is the beginning			
 Matlab matlab aapke kahne ka matlab hai ke agar			
chuhe ke hi state se jo ke khet ka chuha hai aam chuha nahi			
 agar usi ke state se use rok diya jaye to 			
what we're facing today the bubonic plague which is the 			
worst among the three plagues we hear about 			
Can can we prevent it ?			
Yeah			
You see what happens is that from uh from the rodant 			
wild rodant they travel to liven rodant 			
Rodant which are nearer to domestic 			
So as uh Dr Dutta was mentioning about one word plate 			
 one word plate is in the wild uh from the wild to liven rodant			
which come in contact with human being domestic rodant gets infection 			
And from domestic rodant we get infection 			
Once it starts it could stop only at debonic plague 			
That means we would in the envinal region there are			
swelling or in the one word they are swelling 			
And uh it stops there in ninety percent of cases 			
In about five to ten percent of cases it goes on to the blood			
So it becomes ceptic in it's one word 			
While only in about five percent of cases it becomes neumonic			
It goes to the lungs 			
Then it is infectious to man 			
Then it becomes a very dangerous plague and it is infectious			
from man to man			
 Matlab jab chuha khe khet wale se aam chuhe ko			
hota hai			
Aam chuha jo kat ta hai ya use jo fleece jo safed			
hote hai woh jo kat te hain nabbe pratishat cases mei woh			
niche wale hisse mei rah jate hai			
Aur agar woh paanch pratishat uske baad agar woh chadta hai khoon			
mei ajata hai aur baki jo worst cases hai jo 			
neumonic plague hum kahte hain jo aaj kal Dilli mei bhi hai jaise			
 cases jo do huve hain kuch cases main woh			
 lungs mei chala jata hai aur hum thook se matlab			
baatcheet karne mei ya usme phailta hai woh 			
 A few words I would just tell 			
 A few words 			
Before we go into that we'll observe how was the			
clinical presentation of yeah doctor how does it produce 			
that's very important thing 			
 Yeah doctor 			
So that will we've to do one word as he has			
already told that uh actually it is it is this fleece which			
bites a rodant and that in this fleece have got the one or two word			
 out what and what to do a few words 			
So that when they'll bite they were when lies on the			
 uh ground or while walking in the leg area 			
So it was dependent area 			
So it is found that cough if fleece bite from there			
it infection grows and the one word period is there			
If there were two two one word 			
Okay 			
If there're two two cases so the base			
uh whenever the first thing that this fleece sort of one word 			
 and other thing and they doesn't doesn't divide your one word			
 group			
What is the is do you come to know when the fleece bites you			
 ?			
 It's well it's not very much noticed			
about it because it is uh it goes unnoticed 			
And uh one word three types of presentation we'll			
 find about it			
The neumonic neumonic one word but generally			
when the first of the rodant it comes with a fleece of band 			
Generally it comes with the neumonic type of because whenever it			
it is bi biting and then by one			
word emphatic and the the lean note which is 			
leaning drip note that gives you even by the delayed they gone			
 lean note gone in the sense uhm uhm while we've			
 the a few words regular affected 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Any worst one word so this is the way and the			
patient generally feels disordered belly hence within very short time			
within twenty-four hours he feels pain and the gland is swollen 			
enlarge and he becomes excruciating painful about it with all sign			
 about improvision and other signs also particularly one word			
 other things around it 			
What what are the other symptons through which a common			
can come to know of it because			
Generally it's the it's a fever which			
 one word fever is very high rate of temperature and the patient			
becomes an extremly frustrated and one word and often there is a			
 one or two word dead I'm telling of neumonic death 			
 one word becomes very tender acuted this much so that he doesn't			
want to move to a and this whole area about the gland is inflate red			
 and there is vegetal harmones also some sort of uh a few			
words 			
So the the the movement in the			
new situation has to concentrate or adjust itself to many of this 			
uh issues or problem			
Quite right 			
Rasgotraji one uh issue I would like to raise which is that			
as a concept non-alignment is perhaps uh forty years old 			
If you takes take its birth with the			
famous speech of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament			
Nineteen forty-six			
Nineteen forty-six 			
But as a movement it is uh thirty thirty-one years old			
Now despite the fact that uh it has had criticism from all			
quarters that you are mentioning 			
There were critics even during the two words 			
Would you say that in the present situation the concept is still			
valid ?			
That uh that is number one 			
Number two has the non-align movement if it opens a 			
balance of say performance or achievement and I think do you think			
the ledger uh shows more credit or discredits 			
Has it you got anything to be satisfied about in terms of the			
fact that it define for itself a certain agenda ?			
Has it fulfilled at least any element of post agenda or some			
elements of those agenda ?			
 Let's take the concept first 			
Yes 			
I think the foreign policy uh the whole idea of 			
country having foreign policies have been evolving four thousand			
years let us say for a long time 			
Originally the concept that controlled or conditioned the uh			
framing of foreign policy and its one word was the doctrine of			
the supremacy of power 			
Take up your neighbour and the next and the next 			
So you are a dominant power			
Might is right 			
Then came a more uh rational concept in a world 			
which had many more state impending on one another 			
And this concept grew in the Italian city-states of the			
medieval age 			
Uh the back concept is balance of power			
But basically that was also very much rooted in the use of power			
Now in nineteen forty-seven with the Independance of India a whole			
new world emerged 			
And in the fiftees and the sixtees some hundred new			
countries joined the global panorama 			
And this called for the definition of a new concept			
 of our foreign policy and the conduct of foreign policies in the			
country			
That is India's contribution uh to the the			
evolution of the concept 			
Now this I think is a very permanent sort of contribution to			
the whole idea what a foreign policy is ?			
How it should be conducted ?			
And so on and so forth 			
Therefore this is something which is not going to become irrelevant			
 for a very very very long time 			
Those earlier concepts have not become irrelevent today 			
The idea is to make them irrelevent 			
What is non-aligned uh concept basically they forget the			
name 			
 It's a policy of peace independance co-operation among			
nations 			
I think these three concepts are redundant 			
Now these are concepts which are not likely to become irrelevent			
To come to the second point uhm about the uh record or the			
ledger of this movement 			
Look at the initial agenda uh of the movement 			
It was decolonization uh disarmament uh the			
disbandment of apartheid racialism 			
All those most of those items have been acomplished			
And I think in their accomplishment in decolonization for example			
 in dismantling of apartheid even in generating pressure for the			
 beginning of disarmament nuclear disarmament 			
Non-alignment non-aligned movement has played a very very			
significant role which will be part of human history 			
Now times have changed 			
Mind you times have changed in a very limited sense			
I think it's wrong to take that there are no alliances			
Today NATO still exists 			
 It's in search of a new role 			
What happened in the Gulf recently is a good indicator uh			
for us to bear in mind 			
And it's the role of the non-align movement 			
While the last Alliance Block persist to oppose the concept			
of law 			
It is not uh the role of newly independent country uh to			
become a camp follower of one Block because one Block remains and			
the other has disappeared 			
And certainly for India that's not the role I			
visualised 			
Well uh whatever scepticism about the movement is			
there it is mostly in non-official uh sources or quarters because			
governments which are subscribed to non-aligned concept and one			
word and movement are still committed to it 			
And this perhaps explains one reason 			
The reason why those movement started with only twenty-five			
members in Belgrade 			
It is not as many as hundred and two or hundred and three members			
and more and more are at least want to come in either as guests			
or as obeservers or something			
So Mani there must be something in the movement to attract			
them A			
And B they would also perhaps want to find out and assert			
 what non-align movement is going to do ?			
In which area is it is it going to operate ?			
Because the areas of uh imperialism anti-imperialsim			
 anti-colonialism anti-racism all that 			
Theatre is no more a rationing exhausted into it			
In what is a new theatre in which non-align movement can			
operate			
 One or two words 			
Viswam scepticism yes is largely spoiled by			
ignorance and by destructiveness 			
And when you say use that rather gentle word non-official			
 we know that it's mostly people who have not spent time			
understanding the main spirits of not only Indian Foreign Policy but the			
foreign policy of a hundred newly independent counrty 			
Who would wonder whether non-alignment merely is a simplistic			
equation with not being involved in a world which is being divided up 			
into rival military camps 			
When you ask what is the new role of non-alignment ?			
I would prefer to take Mr Rasgotra's phrase and think			
what is the role of non-alignment in the new international context rather			
than seek a new role for non-align movement			
Because the fundamental battle of non-align movement is			
against the quest for dominance 			
We shall alienate international relation for almost			
all of human history 			
The only reason I'm not able to say for all the human			
history is that ever since Jawaharlal Nehru became a major player on the			
international field and brought to bear on international			
relation 			
The better values that has been evolved by Mahatma Gandhi in			
the freedom movement there a new concept was thrown upon the chess board			
of international politics 			
That new chess board being that in the new uh concept being			
 that instead of the quest for dominance could there be a			
quest for co-operation 			
Is it possible for countries which are uneq 			
 unequal in their economic political or military endowments			
 to have a relationship of equality between themselves where we strive			
to attain a one word optimum			
A one word optimum being one where neither 			
that no one is better off by being at a different point of the equiliberium			
and everyone is better off by being attract particular point			
 Yes 			
Well in other words I mean what what			
 you're saying is inequality inequality still			
persist and yeah in order to remove those inequality			
 A few words 			
 Yes 			
 That's right that's what I one			
or two words I want to revert if I may just for a second to			
what I opened with 			
So long as inequality persists non-alignment is required			
So long as oppression is there non-alignment is required			
And so long as equal respect is not accorded that the			
sovereignity of every single nation that long will non-alignment			
 One or two words 			
 Yes Professor Mishra			
 Right right I was saying that uh one of the			
main reasons for misunderstanding in so far as the role and relevence of			
non-alignment is concerned has occured because the uh so called			
soft power is in the hands of the industrialized countries 			
Journals books universities research institutions and so on			
And connected with this is the instrument of mass media 			
Newspapers television this that and so on 			
This total situation has in a sense brainwashed uh elites			
in many countries and it is reflected in some of our newspaper 			
Some of these uh people are writing 			
These are the people who have no appreciation of our hopes			
and aspirations for our needs and requirements 			
Therefore you we come across 			
including newspapers in India some of the national newspapers 			
Papers there they are writing articles on non-alignment 			
which which are absolutely out of phase 			
Now this is one thing about uh I mean the the mass media and			
the so called soft power 			
The other thing which we must keep in mind is that when Jawaharlal			
Nehru pioneered this movement he was the real pioneer 			
He had two things in mind 			
One was that this country was economically poor 			
Politically of not much consequence except that the leadership			
was trying to fail on 			
And at the same time the international situation was very one			
word 			
In fact the the clouds of the third world war uh on our			
horizon on the international horizon at that time 			
He tried to float the idea of non-alignment in order to			
subserve national interest of India in an international atmosphere of			
peace and harmony 			
So in his view the total picture of of the one word			
 was there in which the two systems national and international			
 were not antagonistic with each other			
But they were to function in harmony with each other			
Quite right 			
Mr Rasgotra you want want to say something 			
 May I 			
I just want to one word this kind of scepticism 			
I find much more evident here in our own country than I found it for example			
in Europe			
I was there uh last month 			
I travelled around 			
Uh in countries like Germany and France there is a strong			
feeling that this movement needs to be strengthened 			
As if one word all kinds of new pressures uh are			
coming up			
There are new divisions arising			
Among the developed world also there is uh new uh scramble			
for markets 			
Uh economic pressures and other things			
Now this movement has a role in these circumstances 			
In Europe I found great sympathy with objectives of this			
movement its way of conducting itself 			
And I think that should we we need to uh rethink 			
We should not think of non-alignment or non-align movement as a			
thing between two other things Russia Soviet Union United States			
of America Communism or Democracy 			
But as some an entity in itself with a positive role with a			
positive concept			
Then this kind of scepticism misunderstanding will not arise			
Mr Rasgotra 			
 One or two words 			
Here is in if you permit me I will just say one sentence			
Yes			
That it's a very one word 			
On account of cereberal deficiency and moral timidity 			
I say moral timidity because we are poor or by the by a			
certain power which has reversed most predominant and we are all very			
uh this mantra of uni polarism is unnecessarily			
amongst us			
Quite right			
Try to stress that			
Non-alignment is basically an alternative moral power			
And the reason why the perception that Mr Rasgotra have			
visited Europe 			
Of people in Europe thinking we're all relevent			
adjust the time when sceptics in our country are thinking that we're			
 perhaps less relevent 			
Is that there is a type one word between the			
polarities of the global politics and the polarities of the global			
economy 			
In the global economy there are only two really resurgent			
players 			
There is Germany and Japan 			
 Japan 			
Neither of them has a role in the global polity 			
And the global polity is now dominated by one power which			
is in the mist of the worst recession 			
This is as experienced in			
Domestically right			
 A few words 			
And therefore everyone is searching for a new role			
And at that point in time everyone is looking for a new role			
Specially those who used to be the dominant power 			
For us to say that there is now no role for us in the new 			
uh situation would be the biggest mistake we could do			
No I have we not heard about India's role 			
 a few words 			
 A few words 			
Viswam I want to refined uh with Mani's 			
permission his phrase a little			
He said alternative moral force 			
I think uh 			
Moral force or no moral force			
Obviously there is a force of some kind when hundred countries get			
together 			
I think it's a an alternative vision of the world			
Not a world of power but a world of justice peace 			
co-operation equality among nations 			
So that everybody goes together 			
But the vision vision of one world and one world can come			
about only not on the basis of power but justice fair-play			
equality peace co-operation			
If you permit me I would say this one word to me to			
be a little idealistic 			
 I I I remember a sentence which E H			
 Kirk said in his famous book the conduct of foreign			
policy is not an exercise in sainthood in morality 			
Therefore modern dimension is there but to to to			
 emphasis it too much in the context of either non-alignment or			
foreign policy I think uh will not cut much ice 			
 We're assembled here this evening to 			
discuss the aftermath or perhaps the most reveting diplomatic			
engagement involving India and Pakistan on over			
 that Kashmir issue 			
This is a subject which has really engaged the entire			
 sub-continent's attention for almost uh six weeks I should think			
And uh towards the end it came to almost a nail biting			
finish with the fate of the resolution			
The Pakistan sponsored resolution uh condemning India for			
alleged Human Rights violation in Kashmir becoming a subject of			
international attention 			
And it has been uh sort of great satisfaction uh in this			
country that at the end of a day under uh international pressure			
 particularly pressure from other Third World countries Iran and			
China in particular that Pakistan uh withdrew the resolution			
And uh it is it's not quite something that need			
necessarily be interpreted as a victory or defeat			
But it was question of uh larger Third World solidarity that uh			
was established in Geneva			
And the another major point that came out at the end of the			
Geneva Conference was that certain issues like this perhaps which will			
 be resolved uh through bi-lateral negotiations			
This gives a completely new opening and to discuss uh 			
the fallout of Geneva how we move forward from here and what is being			
what is the reason why India was ultimately able to pursue other			
member countries of the United Nations Human Rights Commission			
Uh to support that the Indian position of this we have uh a			
very distinguished panel here today 			
Uh Mr Salman Khursheed the hero of Geneva who has uh 			
almost uh I would say battled night and day to prevent the uh			
Pakistani uh diplomatic victory in Geneva 			
Uh despite the fact that Pakistan has uh in the past uh			
scored over us on occassion and in the diplomatic arena it's been uh			
very very one word achievement Salman 			
And next to Mr Khursheed is Mr S K Singh former Foreign			
Secretary who has also dealt with Pakistan for a very long time			
I think uh uh apart from having spent time in Pakistan 			
itself uhm as 			
I started in fifty-nine 			
In fifty-nine			
 One or two words 			
A very long time 			
And we've also with us Mr Rasheed Talib senior			
journalist with Aligarh background who has also been uh a commentor 			
on national and international affairs 			
 I'll start with Salman 			
Salman uh the question that has uh occured to me time and			
again is how did we do it ?			
From start till the end I think there was a scale 			
by we finish this eager expections on one one hand			
 on the other hand we were also kind of uh preparing ourselves for			
defeat 			
There was a sentiment that so what even if the resolution 			
target pass have its own fault 			
So we work absolutely short			
So could you tell us little background of this			
How is that we how was this achieved ?			
So I've my own amnesia laughter I			
uh I I was quite confident I think our whole team was quite confident			
that we had uh a margin 			
A clear margin right upto the last date 			
Uh perhaps on the day of the voting the morning of the voting			
 uh we sleep a little bit			
A couple of people uh slipped perhaps due to last			
munute instruction			
But it was our margin that we maintained throughout uh			
which was significant			
And I think important in leading to the situation which finally			
led to uh withdrawl 			
Uh but I think what is significant is the support that we had from			
the European Union 			
Uh largely because of the report that one word 			
ambassadors had had given them 			
And also the support we had in the O I C group where			
it became very clear after the first few rounds of of discussions we			
had that they were not going to take a unified single position 			
And certainly the resolution of the O I C Karachi was not			
going to be uh the guiding sort of spirit of their decision 			
I think that broke the back really off uh the effort by			
Pakistan to get the momentum uh that could convince uh people			
that they could win			
But you know there has been suggestion from the Pakistani side			
 and I think there are people in this country too who uh feel that			
actually how we managed it was the deal 			
The so called deal that India was supposed to have struck with			
Iran and China 			
Uh and that's what really tilted uh the balance that			
Pakistan was have was forced to withdraw 			
How far is that correct ?			
Well I I'm not quite sure that I wouldn't have			
said the same thing if I was in their shoes going back to their country			
Uhm I want to make it absolutely clear absolutely clear 			
that there was no deal no negotiation no settlement 			
We didn't meet Iran or China any more than we met the other			
countries 			
We talked uh very openly and we talked about our position 			
All that Iran did at the time when they ask for adjournment 			
 One word Pakistan said was adjournment being asked by uh			
 Iran			
And Iran said it was being asked by Pakistan was they rang us			
and said want to make a statement to which there will be a response from			
Pakistan and they will withdraw 			
We said uh lest you waste your breath there are a few point			
on which we will object 			
Uh we don't allow anybody to say that about the situation in			
Kashmir 			
For the rest if you have something with Pakistan we'll 			
sit and listen to it			
But we're not repeat not part of any tripartite or			
bilateral agreement on this 			
And that was it they made a statement uh China picked it up			
 others spoke 			
Clearly lot of them said was this is a bilateral matter			
It should remain in the bilateral plain 			
Pakistan then said we agree uh we don't want any			
further actions on our motion 			
That was it 			
Mr Singh do you think that uh there could have been			
something more than what Salman is saying ?			
No I don't uh I don't believe that I I from my experience			
 Pakistan after the kind of efforts it made 			
Let me remind you third committee resolution withdraw 			
After that end of the the session of the UN General			
Assembly 			
Immediately forty-seven or forty-eight or fifty missions sent			
to all members uh capitals of all members 			
Then the Prime Minister identified herself Prime Minister of			
Pakistan identified herself with this dark project as completion			
of her father's work 			
And thereafter she goes there herself 			
Then all this feverish statements being made all over Pakistan 			
all over their media and her the pitch getting higher and higher 			
then they hoping that it would encourage the militants in the Valley 			
And then what happens towards the end they withdraw their			
pivotal of sentence on which they had based their entire strategy 			
That is to send a self finding mission against 			
India's wishes into a good part of India 			
Then that is withdrawn			
And then they one word 			
Actually I think China and uh Iran good very good friends of			
ours and much better friends of Pakistan gave them and 			
totalling or to save their face 			
Because I I came in here as a minister that uh that uh 			
Pakistan would have lost this 			
Now why it happened is something we must generalise 			
Because internationalising this dispute has a kind of			
chain reaction 			
It took it to Human Rights then take it to the General			
Assembly			
And then in the General Assembly nudge it to the Security Council			
That was the game plan and I won't be surprised if it remains a			
game plan for future 			
Not complacently we shouldn't become complacent			
as S K has rightly emphasised			
But the question that a lot of people ask I guess that			
whether in fact there was a withdrawl 			
Taken into view a withdrawl on which I wish the minister would shed			
some light because some people say that at the very last minute the			
chairman of it was the Dutch chairman who said what is			
being deferred that Iranians made a short speech because we objected			
 and uh eventually he said it is not on the agenda 			
for this uh session 			
Now what is that the we a few words 			
Well you know uh what you do with a resolution is that the			
resolution is voted uh upon if the sponsor insist that there should be a			
vote uh it could be defeated it could be accepted 			
Once a resolution is accepted then it gets on to the record			
And a resolution of the kind they wanted was self 			
serving resolution that automatically will repeat itself every year with			
a report but uh serving from a fact finding instruments on 			
What uh you can do to kill a resolution apart from			
defeating it is to bring a no-action motion 			
Uh which is not the preferred instrument now lot of countries			
in the West preferring not to uh to block action as it works 			
through through indirect uh sort of method 			
So we've not uh thought of a no-action motion			
We wanted to be consistent without transparency uh attitude			
We wanted to be consistent with openness 			
And we said nothing to hide no blocks 			
 Let's face it in uh openly let the best man win			
What Iran has said was specifically uh uh request the			
Pakistan to withdraw 			
I had said then that the commission be treat this matter as			
closed after Pakistan withdraw it 			
What the chairman did was to take the request to Pakistan to be			
the operative part of the request to the commission 			
And therefore rule so 			
We immediately protested and I must give credit to Iran and I			
think this is an act of courage 			
Because actually what they could have said well we try to			
help but it was ambiguous you know it's no fault of ours			
 			
Iran took courage instantly in his act			
The ambassador uh one or two word said look			
what I said sir was that this matter be treated as closed no 			
action no further action period 			
So obviously there was no choice 			
Uh chairman said yes I agree if that is the case			
 then no-action period 			
Everybody clapped and it was over 			
That if no any more in of resolution that can			
leave on after this to uh uh be back uh to haunt till next year			
But of course this week like anybody else we are going in for			
new resolution			
Well one thing Chandran 			
Uh to this question that during this very session there			
was another resolution pssed by consensus that was anti-terrorist 			
 ahn right and therefore in this particular session on this two			
aspects of our problem terrorism which is being injected inserted			
into India etcetera etcetera ex exported 			
 into India on the one hand and the human rights question on the			
other hand 			
Human rights question is wiped off 			
During the session terrorism thing stand as a decision of the			
commission			
 Ahn right 			
Rasheed would you agree that the Human Rights question			
has been wiped off ?			
Well I think these are technicalities what the minister			
has just said may be right on it that's what happened 			
But I think we should			
 A few words 			
As we were saying earlier that we should not become			
complacent			
Because it's likely to come up again at			
various other forum and if it does what is going to be our strategy			
In other words what was a strategy that worked here and			
what should we do in order to you know take care of it next time			
Right 			
Yes Salman I I think one question as writer point of view			
commented that perhaps okay we've succeeded uh it has			
been a great achievement but uh this is not going to stop Pakistan			
 from its attempt to internationalise uh Kashmir that is that is the			
possession uh because uh having a democracy existing then we we			
double the effort 			
Now do we've a game plan as to how we're 			
going to confront this in future ?			
Well on two things I would like to say one uh which uh I			
would uh point you through S K's notice			
Because he has far great experience of bilateral work			
Uh which is that despite our confidence that we would win 			
there was a danger and there always is in a vote of anything happening 			
Uh the important thing is that if we had had a vote uh ten			
or twelve people would have voted 			
But the margins would not have been great we would not			
necessarily have known how the others felt 			
They would abstain it 			
Pakistan could have again said it they were abstaining but they			
were in our favour 			
We could have got one or two perhaps explanations of vote that			
could indicate what the mood was 			
But what happened in this uh event was that many country spoke			
 and expressively stated that this was a bilateral matter 			
That this should remain bilateral it should not come in two			
words of an atmosphere of a place like Human Rights Commission 			
I think this was a significant victory and I think we've 			
to take a cue from this 			
Uhm in terms of strategy not victory in terms of you			
know between India and Pakistan 			
Uhm the the second important think really is the transparency			
It was not just practical transparency to ward off a resolution			
It is a policy consistent policy which uh has has input			
at every level ministry of home ministry of defence decision at the			
highest level in our country the prime minister's level 			
That we must be open and we must be transparent 			
We must not hide if there is nothing to hide 			
And if there is something wrong the transparency will bring it			
to our notice as well 			
I think this was appreciated commented upon by the a			
few words ambassadors			
It was commented upon in a statement made by Greece on behalf			
of EU			
And in our international bilateraly this was a crucial thing			
 which turned the mood in our favour			
And uh this is really something that we needed to 			
Good evening and welcome back to the Election Analysis			
Programme			
This will be the last programme this evening			
And our last programme to re wind up will be tommorrow			
night at the same time nine fifty			
Senior members of the congress parliamentary party have had just			
emerged actually from an informal meeting			
And we'll be going to the congress party head quarters to			
try and find out what exactly happened in those folk filled rooms			
But first the head lights head lines at			
ten O'clock tonight			
Congress-I and allies are hurrying towards two hundred and			
thirty-five			
Still twenty-five to thirty short of a majority 			
The BJP plus its allies are set forward for one-twenty 			
In Andhra Pradesh the Congress-I is literally swamping the June			
vote 			
In the May vote we saw the Telugu Desam Desam doing well			
But in June the Congress-I is literally sweeping 			
H K L Bhagat is defeated and George Farnandis win 			
 Is karyakram ke mukhya samachar is prakar hain			
Congress-I wa uske sahyogi dal do sau paintees seetein jeetne ki oor			
Bhartiya Janata Party aur Shivsena ko ek sau			
bees seetein pane ki ummeed 			
Andhra Pradesh mei June ke matdan mei Congress			
bahut aage H K L Bhagat chunau hare aur George Fernandis chunau			
jeete Prannoy			
Well Vinod let's go straight into the latest results			
position			
This is final MP's in the next Lok Sabha 			
and we have results now on three hundred and fifty-five or five hundred and			
eleven seats 			
The Congress-I one seventy-nine out of three fifty-five 			
The BJP coming second on its own with eighty-one 			
The Janata Dal twenty-nine still 			
CPM nineteen 			
The AIADMK eleven and others thirty-six 			
But Telugu Desam still part of the National Front with ten 			
The Ja JMM five CPI five			
 all part of the National Front 			
The BSP is fighting on its own with one seat now 			
RSP part of the National Front and uh totalling thirty-six			
 Let's look at the leading position			
These are the trends			
This includes results			
This is both leading and those results we've just seen			
because we get the overall picture here 			
So we got information now on four hundred and eighty-six out of			
five hundred and eleven seats 			
And the Congress is leading now in two hundred and twenty 			
 It's picked up uh three or four seats in U P at the			
movement 			
But doesn't seems to be going much further 			
BJP is coming second with hundred and seven 			
The Janata Dal fifty-five on its own 			
The CPM twenty-nine 			
The Telugu Desam thirteen			
These are all part of the Nat National Front			
Janata uh National and Left Front combined 			
Others sifty-two 			
CPI eleven 			
AIADMK eleven 			
The JMM six 			
RSP three 			
Bahujan Samaj Party one 			
Making a total of others sixty-two 			
Now this projects into the tenth Lok Sabha 			
something like this 			
Congress plus all its allies put together somewhere around two			
thirty-five			
Take uhm uh plus or minus two three seats 			
The Left Front looks as though it's heading towards fifty			
And the National Front eighty-five			
So together they form a nice little chunk of a hundred and			
thirty-five seats			
Likely to form this is prediction 			
 That's ahead actually of the BJP and its allies which is			
basically the Shivsena which is now heading towards about a hundred and			
twenty 			
And other minor parties are about twenty-one 			
So that's the kind of look that we expect to see			
inside the next tenth Lok Sabha Vinod			
 We've in our studios Dr Muralimanohar Joshi of			
Bharatiya Janta Party Shri S R Bommai of Janata Dal Shri			
Harkishan Singh Surjeet of Communist Party Marxist and Shri N K P Salve			
of Congress-I Prannoy 			
Mr Salve let me start with you 			
What do you expect the President to do next ?			
Uh well what I expect President to do next is what he did			
the last time 			
Perhaps call for the party which is the highest number of			
members in Lok Sabha 			
 That's the only alternative for him 			
Call for the leader of the party			
Good call for the leader of the party			
And who is that going to be ?			
Uh well 			
There is no dearth of talents in our party			
And the Congress parliamentary party is going to decide upon a			
leader who knows how honour ourselve how delicate is the task			
ahead of us 			
He will be a strong			
Not dearth of talent are you talk heavy with leaders in			
fact			
No in fact we are reasonably balanced on all ends			
Which is not top uh heavy nor is it uh top at the bottom			
But the question is we realize the responsiblity			
We have very delicate responsibility 			
We own this responsibility 			
And we'll if we do have to form minority government			
 then we do know that we have to form a durable government 			
And a durable government can not be run only on experience and			
gimmicks			
Yes 			
Where are you going to get the critical thirty seats from in			
order to form a government ?			
No as I said it's the minority government I'm			
 expecting at this juncture			
 If your prediction are correct 			
 A few words 			
Where am I going to get thirty seats is precisely from			
where Mr Joshijee might be expecting some other seats to come 			
I don't have any other source 			
Other are the source which all four parties of all the four had			
But when I say the President would be sending for the 			
leader of a party with the largest number of uh members I do take it			
that even if your projections are correct perhaps the Congress Party will			
be the first one to be called 			
Uh Mr Surjeet from your experience in this 			
these matters how long I mean the country is waiting now for things			
to settle down ?			
 It's been a long campaign			
 It's been uh people are pretty tired 			
They want a bit of uh uh certainty on the political front			
How long do you think this whole thing will take to settle down to			
some kind of uh stability ?			
It should not take much time because now situation is			
pretty bad in the country 			
It requires a government 			
There is no government at the moment 			
And Salveji has rightly stated President has no other option			
but to call the leader of the biggest largest 			
party in the Parliament 			
And then see that uh they take the responsibility			
So you're talking about a week or three days or 			
 one or two word 			
 No no not a week 			
Week is too much too long that's it too			
long			
 Too long 			
Because the situation is critical in the country			
Now you've we've mentioned about Punjab			
problem			
What is happening inspite of the efforts of all the political			
parties they are going cough ahead of the one word 			
cough and all that 			
So many other problems are there			
Situations is very complicated 			
Please carry on			
I want to ask Mr Bommai what is uh you can actually			
authoritatively state as being the President of the Janata Dal the			
official position of the Janata Dal towards a coalition with the			
congress-I ?			
Because they are looking for those thirty seats and you are			
going to have them 			
Now firstly we respect the verdict of the people 			
And they've asked us to sit in the opposition			
And we will be playing a role of the constructive opposition			
So far talk of coalition is prematured in mind unless 			
it is for the Congress-I to decide what they've 			
Whether they want to have coalition whether they want to remain			
minority government 			
All those things have to be indicated by Congress 			
And if there is any indication the National Front and the Left			
 combined we'll sit together and take a view on that 			
Are you open to the idea of a coalition government of			
Congress ?			
No I'm not uh open to that			
But if the situation demands we will give it a go to the			
situation			
 It'll in my view uh too early to answer it			
unless that they move 			
 You're not ruling it out 			
 You're not ruling it out			
No no it comes when you know the whole thing 			
Because the country is passing to a very serious crisis 			
Not financial law and order all things are there 			
And there should be a government 			
And that government should be able to give solutions 			
The when you talk of coalition it's very			
difficult to answer because there are issues on which we oppose			
And if the party which proposes is agreeable to those			
solutions 			
Other than the common issues Joshijee on which your party can			
extend critical suport or constructive support to Congress-I ?			
Uh I don't think so 			
Uh we would be sitting in opposition 			
Uh there is no reason and no occasion 			
So			
I think Vinod said issues particular issues			
Well you see that whenever there are issues uh 			
infringing upon national security say there is a war or there is a			
calamity of an unprecedented magnitude			
Then certainly we extend co-operation and support to the			
government 			
But as of uh in day-to-day normal implementation of			
programmes and policy well certainly I don't find that there is any			
reason or occassion to extend any support 			
But for all measures of uh national welfare I mean			
certainly agreed to political parties			
I think we'll quickly go first to Bombay 			
yeah Murlidhar is waiting			
 Yeah 			
Murlidhar is waiting over there 			
The former Chief Minister of Maharashtra who has been			
declared winner from Colaba constituency 			
Mr Antulay you were one of the leading president 			
attempting to overthrow Mr Pawar 			
What made you suddenly uh one word 			
Well I believe that this assumption unfortunately is not			
very correct 			
See there could be internal differences in any democratic			
set-up 			
Which of course our party claims to have have 			
But when it comes to a national disaster or calamity all			
the local differences even national differences within the party gets			
under 			
What positive sense of insecurity that made you uh mend			
fences with Mr Pawar ?			
What what exactly do you mean by sense of insecurity 			
Because you had the patron of Mr Rajeev Gandhi 			
Now the scenario is different 			
You mean to say that Mr Pawar didn't have the patronage of Mr			
Rajeev Gandhi 			
I believe everybody has patronage 			
He was our leader 			
We all accepted him as our leader 			
The question of patronage if you use that word if you			
choose to use it is not is rather inappropriate			
But if you want to choose it you are welcome to do so 			
But then everybody has his patronage including Mr Pawar 			
So there is no question of Antulay having patronage and not			
Pawar 			
Did Mr Pawar's campaigning uh really help			
you ?			
Well Mr Pawar's campaigning did help dispell			
 the suspicions created by the BJP candidate who was my main rival			
 that he has the support of the Chief Minister which was not true 			
And Mr Pawar's presence there and campaign and			
canvassing was necessary 			
I mean to that effect			
And I think uh we succeeded I mean in that uh			
endevour 			
Would you've lost had it not been for Mr Pawar's			
 campaigning ?			
No I don't think I would have lost 			
That nobody even Mr Pawar also doesn't think that I would have			
lost 			
Even Mr			
Pawar won't say 			
In fact uh it was as I said only to dispell the doubts			
created in the minds of the people by uh against our own Chief			
Minister 			
Because Mr Pawar is a Congress-I Chief Minister and it's			
 my duty as congress man to see that he one or two words 			
Thank you very much Mr uh Antulay we're running			
short of time			
Thank you very much			
On that note this is H V Muralidhara returning you to Bombay			
 Delhi 			
Thank you very much Murali 			
At the moment uh this is the first time actually Vinod thanks			
to one word net this computer uh net-work that we using which is			
the planning commissioned uh infra-structure 			
That we have been able to actually ga 			
garner some information of votes all across the country			
Normaly this takes uh the election commission and other			
sources at least week or ten days to sort out 			
So we we were very luky unto night we can actually review the			
situation today the about the votes of the different parties uh across			
the country			
 Let's look at the all India vote share of all the			
different parties 			
Now this is based so far on four hundred and fifty one lead 			
and the vote position is as follows 			
Thirty-six percent for the Congress-I			
 That's down to about two percent since last time 			
The BJP thirty-three percent coming seco 			
 second doing extremely well 			
The Janata Dal twelve on its own 			
The CPM six and others which is the conglamuration of parties			
 twenty-three			
Now if we compare this with nineteen eighty-nine and look at the			
vote change of swing in vote the Congress as I said was down two percent 			
The BJP the biggest gainer almost doubling its vote to ten percent			
The Janata Dal suffering quite a set back now really in three			
states down by five percent 			
CPM about up point five to one percent and others down four			
percent 			
 One or two words laid down their lives in the last			
twelve month 			
And since nineteen sixty-nine when six brave policemen			
patrolling in Leh were ambushed and killed by the Chinese 			
But such acts of courage have not really altered the public			
image of the police 			
Ask any ordinary citizen of the country and a city dweller 			
or uh a peasant in a village or indeed women and they will tell you			
 that police have quite sincerely tried to enchained them at the level			
of interaction of the ordinary citizen and the police			
Why this is so ?			
Is change really possible ?			
Is it impossible ?			
Why things not changing ?			
Who is at fault ?			
Who is to blame ?			
To answer these and several other question we have a hand picked			
and distinguished panel Mr M N Jacob state Home Minister Mr Soli			
Sorabjee eminent eminent Supreme Court advocate and former			
Attorney General and Mr T Anantchari who is Director General of the			
Border Security Force 			
So you are two words we can start with you 			
You have been a consistant and unsaving critic of the government			
 and also of the police			
And you have said that there've been many human rights			
violation 			
Why have you been saying this ?			
Well uh human rights violation I would 			
concentrate upon specially the method and the procedure that			
the police employ in investigation at the time of crime 			
One of the things which we commonly find is the use of 			
third degree method 			
Sometimes even the recourse to torture in extracting			
statements and extracting confessions 			
 There're constitutional prohibition against it 			
When even the criminal procedure code has provisions against			
the use of such methods 			
But in actual practice these constitutional provisions are really			
 two words 			
Then one of the reasons which I find because I've also			
friends in the police force 			
I know the one word we should understand their problems			
 their difficulties they have to cope with not ordinary criminals 			
But today these criminals are very well armed			
They have sophisticated technique 			
So one of the uhm excuses reasons to give forward is			
 it's not possible to deal with harden criminals 			
 It's not practical to investigate these cases unless			
 we have recourse to these methods			
Mr Jackob is it possible or is it not possible to deal with			
hardened criminals without using third degree method ?			
I think it is a mixed reaction because it is not			
suppose to be a torturous method or a third degree method 			
But at the same time there do come across some instances 			
where uh unwanted methods are also adopted 			
And may be it has certain various reasons 			
We will have to find the solutions now 			
 I I I will project it like this 			
that we have to have more of team trained well			
trained in this task of investigation or extracting the			
truth 			
Modern methods will have to be used 			
Then there will be more simplified one word 			
The coarse methods are rotten 			
Sometimes as a hang-over of past when you were not having 			
any thing of that sort 			
But by and large it's it's a all not a			
general complaint			
It is an image that is projected outside 			
But I don't agree that totally it is true			
But there are cases			
But it is refreshing to have the government admit that uh 			
coarse methods are used by the police Mr Anantchari 			
Well I think this problem you cannot uh discuss in			
isolation			
I would like to say first of all there can be no two			
opinion about the need to eradicate third degree method 			
Police cannot adopt it as a method of that's the			
method or as a policy 			
Having such reason I would like to say that police cannot			
function diverse from the cultural one word of the society 			
The legal system the restrictions that it imposes 			
First of all I would like to say when I say cultural one word			
 of society 			
There is uh that I am permitted to say			
We are having double standard in our society 			
They would say one thing in law 			
They expect something else to be done 			
 E it depends on who is affected			
and who is wanting to police one word 			
I think that is the point we've got to understand			
We cannot run away a few words totally			
Secondly in our country everybody seems to be in great			
hurry and want results 			
And when it when they want results from			
themselves they would like to adopt their own method 			
And then the police becomes uh important hand made 			
This is one aspect of it 			
Secondly you want to run the society on modern basis on			
terms of modern terms of modern concept with a law which is totally			
hackneyed 			
I do not know if very many of us know that the institution			
called the FIR this institution called the FIR first information report			
is peculiar to the sub-continent 			
Nowhere else in the world do you have it 			
Once you write something in the FIR it becomes impossible to			
 even the telling the truth to get out of it 			
So you will have to often to satisfy the courts add up 			
the evidence to see that what you said in the FIR uh come through the			
investigation			
I think it is a very big 			
Third is we must also when you think of police image 			
you think of police as part of the total criminal justice system 			
Thus they have the criminal justice system improve			
Has it uh Soli 			
In fact I think that specially is relevent 			
Improvement in the criminal justice system is nothing to do to 			
sanction tolerate mitigate and absolve the police from the use of			
methods which are not correct 			
I appreciate what Mr Anantachari has said about the double standard			
But what he meant by double standards and people want results is			
really the two words of the police 			
Orders come from political bosses from people in authority to			
see there one of their cousins and one of their friends who is			
being investigated two words 			
Policemen says baba kya karega order 			
ho gaya 			
There are exceptions 			
There are some bail source 			
Another way the order comes when they want their political			
rivals to be arrested			
Order goes to the police station and the orders are carried out			
So I entirely agree about the double standards			
And I think the real if I must say so one word of the			
police is the politicisation of the police 			
And that must stop 			
Because many unconstitutional illegal commands are carried out 			
just in order not to get into trouble			
They may be transferred they may be suspended 			
But criminal justice system has not improved by means one or			
two words 			
The delays in the criminal justice system investigation as part			
of the criminal system justice system 			
And if the investigation is not covered the investigations is not			
 one word naturally we won't have a sucessful prosecution of the			
criminal			
Yeah Soli politicisation is there			
I was just trying to uh see through your word			
politicisation 			
Because uh my experience I think that there is not			
politicisation as people imagine			
Because every political party come to the police 			
Everyone has a faith in police 			
And even in India the states and states differ in political			
systems seldom changes 			
So everyone come to uh power 			
One party or other 			
And the police had to follow a middle course 			
They are not pressurise by the politicians 			
Even if the pressure goes police is not listening to a			
politician because it is the system 			
But I see the very fact that all the party people or			
politicians are relying on the police 			
Irrespective of nature of the government			
I think though there is some truth sometimes someone may 			
 one word it			
But it may not be a genuine case that there is the			
politicisation of the police force in India			
I beg to differ from one word 			
 But 			
Mr Jacob what you're saying is that all political			
parties manipulate the police 			
As far as one or two words I am not picking out one			
political party			
What you are saying comes to these all politicians			
No no I am the			
I think they're well independent in their own			
investigation			
Well I wish that was true 			
I don't blame the police			
Mr Anantachari why don't you one word 			
In fact in fact I thought I should appropriately get			
an opportunity to one word 			
You will have it right now 			
 Because because the whole thing arouse out			
of my statement which are in two parts			
One when I mentioned about the criminal justice system and			
second about double standard 			
This double standard I related to the cultural one word			
 in the society as a whole 			
It is if you ask me it is not merely the politicians 			
it is a neighbour			
If your house is burgled so long as his house is not burgled			
 the neighbour will keep quiet 			
When his house is burgled he does not mind the police using any			
method to get his things howsoever 			
 Correct 			
So I am only this this runs through our society 			
And I must say as a policeman as a well meaning policeman			
 as a policeman who would like to live within the system and reform it if			
there are reforms required with a high sense of motivation 			
Uh I would like to say that this is uh I think which is a			
very important uh factor that hampers the police			
That is the one 			
And not this kind of effort would policeman change 			
Second I must also clarify was the criminal justice			
system 			
Today there is no point uh in saying that uh police			
role should change 			
I think the police have to change a lot			
There is no doubt about it 			
There are good people there are like any other organisation 			
institutions there are also bad people 			
But only thing supposed to be accountable to law 			
If the judiciary the judicial process has functioned properly and			
I am very sure we'll have very well behaved police 			
Today there is so much of tolerance			
So much of one word 			
So much of uh looseness in the entire judicial process that			
you see			
When I say judicial process it started it is uh			
something you will form to find at all the levels			
of judiciary 			
Whether it is prosecution whether it is defence whether it is			
uh administration of justice			
So therefore I feel that police is only one of the links of			
 one word system 			
And it is the one that is the cutting edge			
But Mr Anantachari before we loose track of politicians			
 would you say that politicians apply pressure on the police or don't they			
 ?			
You see politicians may or may not apply 			
But it is upto the police officer			
I I would like to say that I have this holding			
important charges as SP DIG DIG CID in the state various jobs 			
Politicians have continued with this one word 			
They have tried to also put some pressure 			
But it did not do and explained to them most of the time they			
did not interfere 			
And if you kept your end clean I think very few politicians			
really try to interfere with you 			
 It's a question of it's it's a			
double game that is what the politicians wants and what you want to play			
I think both have to one word 			
 Soli what is in your experience 			
I think we repeat itself of course if we say so			
The fact of the matter is pressure is a fact			
And money two words politician don't think even			
politician even the industrialist capitalist people wealthy			
people people who built ill-terms and power 			
They do trap 			
Let me ask one question 			
Why is it that despite of so called failure of the criminal			
justic system a citizen will certainly go with more confidence into a			
court of law before a magistrate than before a police ?			
Why is it that no woman will dare to go to a police station alone			
 ?			
Why is it that the landless labourers especially the schedule			
caste is directed he will not dream of going to a police station ?			
 I'm talking of rural areas 			
The reason is and I don't say that			
Why do you			
Why don't you let Mr Jacob 			
 A few words 			
I I'll complete the question			
The reason is the perception 			
May be it is an exaggerated perception 			
But it is there that the police is not our friend and an ally 			
police is an instrument of the system and that system is oppressive			
as far as the landless as far as the deprived sections are			
concerned			
Mr Jacob would you say the police is for the rich			
 No I'm I'm I am afraid that I			
may not be able to agree with Sorabji though I've I've			
 tremendous respect for him as a lawyer 			
But yes every police station in India is almost crowd of			
these all these people who are who are affected someway or other 			
the women the backward the weaker section 			
I don't think they are afraid of going to a police station 			
They don't go to the police station			
The first thing they will do is to go to the police station			
and report the crime whatever happened 			
Then of course we have go to the court			
So I think by and large the police stations are crowded			
 and the policemen's workload is also very heavy 			
Correct			
Uhn 			
But Mr Jacob please ask the several NGO's 			
non-governemntal organizations who appear on behalf of landless			
labour one word workers you will get more precise			
information and statistics from them as to how they really fear entering			
a police station 			
May be you may be right in saying but there is no reason			
for the fear 			
But the whole impression that has been built up in some of the			
areas is landlords vested interest are in cohout with the police 			
As most of you must be aware parliament conveyance tomorrow			
 for its first session in the new year 			
It will be a very important session not only because it will be			
a fairly long one stretching right into the middle of May but			
also because because it will be the budget session 			
And the most crucial among all the Parliament Sessions 			
The railway budget and the annual general budget will be			
presented during the session 			
There was a time when the budgets were just mere fiscal			
exercises 			
Exercises in balancing the revenue account and the capital account			
But those days seem far away 			
The present day trend is that the budgets are regarded as			
 very strong and major indicators of the governments political			
ideology and its approach to the economic problems of the			
country 			
It has almost become a fashion with us media people to			
predict that every session of Parliament will be a stormy one 			
Well looking uh into the issues that have been 			
figuring in the newspapers there is enough of the element of controversy			
 in them to make this coming session of Parliament perhaps a			
really stormy one 			
It has been my experience that although several issues			
 are identified as likely to dominate uh Parliament sessions 			
invariably it so happens that some other issues come in and			
take not only the parliamentarians but also the people by surprise 			
But this time to my mind cough the issues are fairly 			
clear because I expect at least uh the issue to			
dominate the current session of Parliament will be mostly economic			
 in nature 			
To identify some of the issues and to discuss them and analyse			
them with me tonight around this table you will see Sukharamjee			
 and Murali Bhandarijee of the Congress-I on my			
left Shrimati Sushama Swaraj of the Bharatiya			
Janata Party and Shri Gurupadswamy of the			
 Janata Dal and Shri Somanath			
Chatterejee of the CPM 			
You might have uh read in the papers that the 			
 National Front and the Left Front 			
parties have decided to boycott the Address of the President to the			
joint session of the two houses tomorrow morning 			
Uh before uh we really begin to discuss the issues I would like			
uh the representatives of the two parties with us here today to			
enlighten us on the logic and rationale of this very very drastic			
step of uh deciding to boycott the President's Address			
Somanath would you like to begin set the ball rolling			
 Yeah 			
Yes I want to make it clear at the beginning that our			
decision to boycott the session is not any not a 			
 reflection on the President personally 			
We have high respect for him as a as a person 			
But we feel that the President's joint address 			
address to the joint session as uh even the Constitution uh provide			
for is not meant to be a ritual 			
And the President is expected to announce the government's 			
policies economic policies primarily as well as other policies 			
But so far as this government is concerned during in the			
inter-session period they have taken very important decisions on			
matters affecting the people affecting the economic situation in this			
country 			
And all those decisions have been taken without taking the			
Parliament into the con uh confidence 			
bypassing the Parliamnet behind the back of the Parliament therefore we said			
 just to go and listen to what has already taken place will be a			
mere formality because the Parliament has been has been reduced to			
irrelevence			
And this speech all this address to joint session will serve no			
purpose 			
Therefore to register our protest to the governemnt's 			
way of functioning and taking the Parliament for the granted			
 ignoring the Parliament in vital issues we felt that we should			
register our protest in a more and a very democratic manner without			
showing any disrespect to the President's personell			
Murali would you agree with this point of view or would			
you think that the stand taken by the opposition is the little uh little			
Well I think they are fulfilling their role eminently			
Yes			
That is to oppose oppose and oppose			
But propose nothing 			
There is no logic in this at all 			
Because firstly in the last budget which was only in			
the month of July the whole policy was unfolded 			
Steps were taken to implement that policy 			
There have been very important lengthy discussions on all			
aspects whether it is the industrial policy whether it is devaluation			
 whether it is free market economy whether it is the entry of the			
multinationals whether it is the export policy 			
We have had extensive debates not only in the last budget			
session but also in the winter session 			
Now I cannot understand their saying that all this has been			
implemented behind the back of the Parliament 			
I think they are merely finding an excuse because they are			
today without any substantial issue in the Parliament 			
 I think they are also conscious that after			
the Punjab election and particularly if I may take the events of the			
 just last four weeks the excellent manner in which 			
particularly the Prime Minister P V Narsimha Rao has held the whole			
situation 			
Look at the unfurling of the National Flag on the			
twenty-sixth of January ending in the fiasco of the ekta ekta			
yatra 			
The determine manner in which we repelled any crossing into			
Kashmir on the eleventh of February 			
The way in in which we have bro 			
brought democracy back on the race in Punjab 			
And in the process we have achieved a position where there is			
little threat to the survival of the government			
 One word 			
Well Murali you have begun already talking about the			
achievements of the government			
Where as I thought first we will identify the issues that are			
likely to come up			
What Sukharamjee in view of your party are the main issues			
 that are likely to come up ?			
Or what do you expect the major thrust to be on ?			
 Mere khyalme teen kism ke jo samaseyein hai ya masle			
 Parliament mei ayenge ek to arthik economic			
issue aur doosre defence of country 			
aur teesre socio- political issues jaise Jharkand			
hai Jammu Kashmir hai doosre hain magar mai aisa samajta hoon ke sab			
se jyade jo debate ya Parliament 			
mei jo uhm jyada samay lagega woh economic issues ke			
upar hai abhi jaise aap ko malum hai sare desh ko malum hai ke jab is			
 government ne karyabhar sambhala to hamare 			
one word position kya thi mushkil se hamare pas teen hafte			
se kum ka hamare pas ayat ka woh foreign exchange tha			
 aur uh phir external hamare pas jo foreign			
loan ka tha ek uhm uske liye bhi hamare paas badi samaseyein thi			
 to is baat se bade kuch harsh step lene pade waise			
 sare sansar mei itne democracys hain usme hamesha			
 democratic government jo hai woh sakht options 			
opt karti hain magar is sarkar ke samne hard options			
 ke siway koi uh chara nahi tha is baat se ye jyada taur par			
 financial problem jo hain yeh dominate 			
karengi yeh debates 			
Gurupadswamy do you uh share this view that uh the			
 government had no option but to go in for hard decisions ?			
And the hard decisions taken have let to a kind of a reforming			
of this economic structure which in the view of the opposition			
 has not been on right lines 			
See let me uh answer your first question			
Yes 			
Why National Front and 			
Left Front have decided to boycott the President's			
 Address 			
You appreciate for last twenty years at no time 			
so many important decisions have been taken without reference to			
Parliament 			
My friend Bhandarajee said many of the issues have			
been already discussed in Parliament 			
Discussion on difference of issues is one thing 			
Many issues are discussed in Parliament 			
But I am talking of issues where the government takes			
decisions 			
I do not find in the annals of Parliament so many important			
and vital decisions have been taken without the approval of Parliament			
Gurupadswamy will you identify one or two such decisions			
 when you are making a distinction between a policy implementation and			
a decision 			
 You'll you'll uh you'll see 			
you will know that uh functions the agreement that has been			
reached on various issues in the International Monitory Fund			
 and World Bank 			
Duncan proposals and one word intellectual			
property rights and so on			
Uhm 			
They have not been thoroughly discussed 			
And approval of Parliament has not been obtained 			
Their vital issues is affecting the economy of the country itself			
So after a good deal of thought we came to this			
conclusion 			
And uh I just say that President's Address is a			
very important occasion 			
A unique event which comes once in every year 			
And the President has to tell Parliament tell the country 			
the present situation shoud also say what agenda will be taken			
up by government ?			
What are the issues on which decisions are taken by the			
government ?			
So I do not want the address be a a dreary affair a			
dull affair a ritualistic affair 			
It should be it should be a very important document 			
And I think that one word has been destroyed			
Well Bharatiya Janata Party is the major			
opposition in the Lok Sabha 			
And the BJP as you see has not shared			
the perception of the National Front Parties and the			
 Left Front Parties 			
And they are not boycotting the President's 			
Address 			
Does this mean Sushmajee that BJP is			
 more or less in agreement with the Congress government's 			
economic policies ?			
Or is it because they think it is not wise to announce a			
boycott ?			
 In Hindi 			
 Accha Murali do you agree with			
this conclusion that the rise in prices and the growing growing graph			
of unemployment is a logical corollary of the structural reforms			
that you have carried out in the party in the last one year ?			
And secondly that uh Parliament could have given			
its green signal to many of these policies and then you could have walked on			
them 			
Their complaint basically is that the government has			
unilaterally more or less gone ahead with very very vital decisions in			
the economic field even though you had acquainted them with the broad			
orientation 			
Well I won't agree with that because I think			
the most important issue is the price rise 			
Because inflation is the cruelest form of taxation on the			
poorest of our people 			
And no government can afford to impose that taxation on our			
people 			
I think my party as well as my party's government			
 is conscious of this fact 			
Undoubtedly we were placed in a as it has been explain by my			
 colleague Sukharamjee 			
We were placed in a position where we had to do certain			
thing not uh willingly in a sense that we had to take very			
hard options 			
We didn't choose soft options 			
All of us had predicted including the treasury benches			
They had predicted that the budget would result in price rise			
 and the inflation has to be controlled 			
So I do not think that something new has happened 			
 Everybody's expectations in this case unfortunately			
have been found to be true 			
Therefore that is one thing			
I don't think whatever has been done by the government is a			
sequence 			
Now taking what my friend Gurupadswamy says for example on			
the Duncal proposal we have set up a high powered committee under the			
chairmanship of Arjun Singhjee 			
And he had been have been having 			
talks with all sections 			
All the leaders of the opposition parties all sections of the			
society 			
And no decision has yet been taken 			
I think these are all the excuses			
One must in a democracy not anticipate that the 			
Presidential Speech will be lacklustre or without substance 			
It will be full of substance			
There will be a motion of two words and the motion of			
thank would be voted upon 			
 Yes 			
That is true			
That is the convention usually			
But Murali you made uh one or two points 			
The first point is that uh there was a uh in the 			
system itself there was an inbuilt provision or compulsion for the			
rise in prices and therefore the rise was anticipated			
But you must remember this government came into being on			
the basis of a manifesto which had promised that prices will be rolled			
back to the July uh nineteen ninety level			
That has not happened 			
On the contrary the criticism of the opposition as I see it is			
that the country does not only have inflation but it is also beset by			
 two words 			
Now Somanath uhm your party uh has had uh			
serious objections if I remember to the very idea of approaching the			
 IMF 			
And all the oppositions parties have had reservations on the kind			
of conditionalities which the IMF uh imposed 			
Now the claim of the Finaince Minister has been that the the			
benifits of this reforms that have been introduce will be felt in the			
 only in the next three years and not before 			
Meanwhile prices are going up 			
What is the perception of the opposition to this situation ?			
 Uhm 			
You see all our apprehensions have proved to be correct			
Ah			
Unfortunately in the sense that the common people are			
suffering because of the policies of this government 			
It is very easy to say that for the next three years the prices			
will rise there will be inflation 			
But what is the government going to do to come to the rescue of			
the people common people 			
We have been uh stressing on strengthening the public			
distribution system making um essential commodities available to the			
common people at a vulnerable sections of the society at a a			
reasonable price 			
But instead of doing that we have had to find during the			
inter-session the government has increased the administered price of the			
commodities namely rice wheat etcetera which are distributed			
through public distribution system 			
Therefore this government has not only not made an attempt to			
contain the price rise is well I think fuel to the fire 			
Why administered price increased ?			
Now this is very easy to say there will be prise rise because			
of so called structure and reform 			
We by structure and reform I mean we find that there is a			
complete surrender to the IMF 			
We have never said one word one need not or one			
should not go to IMF 			
We say we should not go there on bended knees 			
We should not accept conditional deeds which will be			
destructive of our economic one word 			
And which will mean abandonment of our national committment to			
self-reliance 			
And precisely that has happened in this country 			
Today you find every section of the community is feeling the pinch			
of not only the pinch the weight of this inflation 			
And not only the poorest of the poor even the middle class today			
are talking of this 			
Now apart from this the very economic dir 			
 direction of this country has been altered totally 			
without the Parliament being taken into confidence 			
Almost every country in the world today has to grapple with the			
challenge of population aging or the growth of the number of older			
persons in any society or population 			
Death appears to be more or less a universal phenomenon and it is			
referred to as demographic transition 			
In the century to come this isssue of population aging 			
will raise many vital and new questions which need to be addressed urgently			
In India for example at present the number of people in our			
society in the sixty plus age group is some fifty-five million 			
In about thirty years the number could well be 			
two hundred million 			
The first international conference on aging is to be held and in			
fact being held in India			
At this time we have with us in our studios today two eminent			
experts in the field of aging 			
May we introduce them to you			
We have first on my far right Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale who is			
the president of the International Federation on Aging 			
And then we have immediately to my right Dr K B Gangarade			
former Vice Pro-Vice-Chancellor Delhi University and a United Nation			
expert on aging			
I can't think of anything else to call your designation laughs			
 a few words 			
Quite right			
I use that I for what uh uh many other 			
Uh may we begin with you Dr Gokhale			
There is an International Federation on aging which is the			
moving spirit behind this conference recently being held in Bombay and Pune			
Would you tell us about this International Federation ?			
Yes this federation was established about twenty-five			
years ago 			
 We've about hundred countries in membership of this			
organization 			
We have about twenty international agencies which are in membership			
of this organization 			
We are interested in programmes at the policy level which			
means we have conferences we have research programmes in medical as			
well as non-medical subjects 			
We have publications and the field programmes or the			
grass-root programmes are really developed at the country level 			
where we provide the necessary technical know-how and support 			
And we also act as a body which is consulted by the			
United Nations on the subject of population aging 			
That is what is the broad description of this organization 			
Dr Gokhale there is also an Indian Federation of Aging 			
 yeah what about this organization ?			
 Yeah 			
Indian Federation of Aging was started about five years ago			
They are interested in developing old age homes 			
But old age home is a concept which is becoming out of date 			
So now they are developing day care centres 			
They also have their own publication called 			
Kanchan-Kalp 			
They also relate to a number of voluntary organizations in the			
country which are working in the field of aging			
They co-ordinate them 			
They are also in the area of development of policy and			
advocates 			
That is briefly the role of the Indian Federation of Aging 			
And in addition to Indian Federation there are other five-member			
agencies such as Lok-Kalyan Samitee in			
Delhi and other which work in this particular area 			
Dr Gangarade uh you are an expert on aging again Sudhir			
before you take over 			
As a expert			
But there is a global dimension to this demographic			
transition through which so many societies are passing 			
 Kyon ke jitni bhi samay jitne bhi samaj hai lagta hai			
ke jo bujurg umr ke loog hai unki sankhya badhti jarahi hai 			
What are the global dimensions of this issue ?			
Let me tell you first by two thousand AD 			
eighty-six percent of the old people will be found only in the Asian			
region 			
We can say dimension of the Asian region 			
If you take the whole world as such about fifty-six percent of			
the people old in the whole world 			
From that particular point of view ninteen-eighty to two			
thousand the period will be that the population of the old people			
 will be much more than the young and the younger 			
In fact if you take third world as such there is a 			
somewhere there is a very good formula that's third age			
 plus third world and third is it equivalent to third class 			
 Laughs 			
Well you see a and that means the kind of changes			
which were odd in the one word they are most the old people			
 after modernization has done not the time to do it 			
In fact modernization has been a kind of a curse to the			
old people 			
Both in the western and industrial society as well as in			
 our society also 			
In the western society the young is accepted because he			
is a productive element 			
But the moment the one becomes old he 			
dis out of the you can say productive market 			
That he is not a productive market he is not respected 			
So whatever we hear it is true that whenever we talk of the			
old age let me slightly say here that the concept of aging must			
change in the sense there are some people who may have what I			
call the functional age 			
That even after the age of hundred years they are active 			
We can have a number of example that before eighty eighty-five 			
the one or two word may be more a active than on the			
fortieth 			
There may be some people who are not so much active 			
For it is it is not a chronological age that becomes important 			
But what is the age become important personal age 			
So to what extent you can one word functionally important			
 depends that is it possible youngster living the sixty year fifty			
year age the retirement age			
Because what we call retired not the reason of old but he			
is retired because of the chronological age 			
So they all majo major problem			
is to what extent we can continue to make the old people as a			
productive agent of the society			
Thereby they retained their status thereby they retained			
their spirit thereby also they become proud of themselves 			
Dr Gangarade may I interrupt at this stage 			
As far as I can see it there are two primary causes for this			
 global phenomenon of demographic transition about old people in			
society			
The first would be declining fertility rate and the second			
possibly increase in life expectency 			
That being so what are the repercussion on a country's			
 socio-economic structure of this phenomenon of aging ?			
 Let's ask Dr Gangarade			
The most important point to remember let us identify three			
factors which are which are very important			
Okay 			
One is let's say one word Indian society			
itself			
At one time there was no occupational difference between the			
old and the young 			
Whatever the father did the son did the same thing 			
Now with the technological change there is a lot of			
occupational differences taken taking place 			
Similarly with the migration some time old people remains in			
the village and the younger persons comes to the town 			
So that is the another problem 			
Third is also our individualistic way of life is also gradually			
 taken place 			
To that extent the first socio-economic problem is what I call			
it if you take into four four kind of formula or criteria 			
If an old person is physically sound if the old person is also			
economically happy or healthier that is economically sound 			
Socially and mentally if he is also alert then that old person			
becomes a wanted person 			
But if you minus each of these than becomes an unwanted person			
But what happens even a let us say in our society where still			
the relationships are certainly maintained 			
Because even if you see sometime even though the uh younger			
may not like the older people but the older people wants to remain with			
their grand children 			
That kind of emotional tie is is remaining there 			
So but the kind of inflation which is taking place all-round			
when I use the word all-round prices see in a city the housing			
problem etcetera 			
So sometimes the younger people begin to feel either the old			
people should remain in the village or get out of the house as soon			
as possible 			
To give you a very concrete example in one of my surveys I			
found that even the father in Delhi is welcome for three days 			
If after fourth day remains the both the in-laws that			
is daughter otherwise son-in-law begins to feel there is something wrong			
somewhere and he must get out 			
So even the father is not welcome to			
Why ?			
Because firstly the scarcity of the space in the in the house			
Secondly also because now- a-days the rate prices are			
high 			
Economically it is not possible 			
But what happens is why sometimes they are welcoming when they			
both are working wife and husband 			
Sometime they feel to have the old people is good so that			
they can do baby-sitting job 			
So the yane most perhaps they begin to			
feel that old people are needed for a baby-sitting job 			
Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale agala prashna apke liye hai			
 Ji kahiye 			
 Kisi bhi samaj ki kisi bhi desh ki arthik vyavasta jo			
hai uspar kya prabhav padta hai is uh prashna ka 			
I I means mean I'm little			
reluctant to refer to it as a problem			
 But aging is not really a problem it's an			
issue 			
So wha wha what will be the			
impact on the economic health of the country ?			
 Ahn 			
Basically Deepakjee uh once you have a large			
population of people of sixty plus age group or age bracket the			
dependency ratio starts increasing 			
Many thereby should take the continue 			
continuation of life from zero to hundred 			
There are more people at the younger age who depend on the people			
who earn 			
Similarly there is a larger group of people above the age of sixty			
 who're depending on the earnings of the fewer people 			
Which means that more people are dependent on the			
earnings of fewer people 			
Which is a basically economic problem 			
And countries like Japan are really facing this problem very			
 serious seriously 			
The other issue is the issue of pension graduity or			
social security 			
Social security presently is only for the organized sector of			
society uhm and not for the unorga 			
unorganized sectors like the landless labours or the small			
farmer 			
So how to provide security to these groups is another issue 			
And thirdly most of the countries in the West are finding			
 that pension is no more an answer to meet the needs of the			
people who are sixty plus 			
And therefore they are finding or searching for new ways 			
whereby pension could be replaced by some funding while they are earning			
Also the other issue related to this uh uh by pension and			
provident fund etcetera is providing the third career to the people 			
Now the uh most of the countries in the West are trying to			
encourage people to take up a new assignment at the age of forty			
They can change jobs 			
And lastly they are trying to prepare people for so called			
retirement 			
They start giving the person one day off at the age of fifty-five			
 so that he can develop some alternatives 			
At the age of fifty-six they will give him two days off like that			
 at the age of sitxy years he is totally ready to change job			
 Uhm 			
In other words Dr Gokhale the time at which at			
the age at which the person withdraws from the labour force should this			
be after discussion of some agency like the government or of the			
individual himself			
It has got to be with the individual and not with any			
government 			
Because whether you are able to work or not is something you			
can decide 			
In India for example a businessman doesn't retired 			
 retire untill he himself feel that he has to retire 			
Farmers doesn't retire and politicians you know they just			
don't retire 			
So point is if a person feels that he should retire certainly			
he should retire 			
But if he feels that he can work I I remember Deepak mm mm			
 incident recently			
One of my collegues in the UN retired uh and I was asking his			
wife how does she feels now when the husband is in the home ?			
And she said that previousely I had a full time			
salary and a part-time husband 			
And now I have a part-time salary and full time husband 			
which is a few words laughs 			
Dr Gangarade uh may we come to you for a movement now 			
 Kai aise sawal hai aaj hamare sansar mei jahan yeh dekha			
jara hai ke mahilaye jo hain woh purushon ki apeksha unka jo jeevan hai			
wo jyada lamba hota hai they can they live longer than man 			
ab iska kya asar padhta hai samaj par 			
 Ek jo abhi jo Gokhale saheb ne kaha jo aap			
 economic sawal puchhe uspar mai kahna chahunga 			
Dekhye jo young hota hai woh bhi karib karib			
chaar decade tak jyada saal tak kam karta hai 			
Nahi usne kaam nahi kiya hai usne society ko			
 contribute kiya hai ab society ka ye jaroor			
hota hai response the reciprocation society must also			
reciprocate him 			
 Dekhye jo is wakht hamara jo khas sawal is prakar ka hai			
 ke jab life expectency bad rahi hai to world			
 a few words 			
It is not only the money which is important but what is			
important is the work or occupation is a therapy 			
Without the work men feels lonely 			
Without the work men feels some vaccum kind of it 			
As Dr Gokhale was saying I can give an example as I said			
again to repeat in my own study I found a person who retired from the			
government service 			
By ten O'clock he would put his shoes go in his			
study-room take all the files 			
Whatever the files he had and look everyday upto five 			
laughs 			
He gets into a particular kind of routine			
Whole organization get disturbed 			
Yeah			
So so one of his routinisation like you said the wife			
will have no problem laughter a few words 			
Dr Gokhale now this conference that is going on right at this			
time uh really we should have talked about it a little earlier			
But then in the morning show we are different from the rest so 			
we have just a couple of minutes left 			
Now what are issues that you are discussing in this conference ?			
You see there are uh major issues pertaining to aging			
that are being discussed			
Such as disability and aging 			
You see out of the total disable population in the world sixty			
percent people are elder 			
So we would like to discuss that 			
We would like to discuss the issues regarding social security 			
for the elderly population 			
We would like to discuss indigenious health services such as			
 Ayurveda Acupuncture Unani system			
What can they do for aging ?			
 That's another subject we are going to discuss 			
But more than that we are going to discuss the subject of the			
rights and the responsibilities of elderly 			
A charter that was discussed at the economic and social			
council of UN which is being discussed in this informal sector and			
subsequently it will go to United Nations 			
That is a very important subject that we have to discuss 			
And of course in addition to this there would be a number of 			
subjects number of lectures etcetra			
And finally Dr Gokhale uh the conference will 			
one or two words 			
What do you expect to emerge at the end of the conference ?			
We are really hoping 			
Number one that the whole emphasis will change 			
You know presently people tend to think that aging is a			
problem or its a subject of charity 			
We want to change it to make that aging an elderly 			
they must be ready participated to participate 			
they must be productive 			
So the change of emphasis that's what we we want 			
Secondly what we want is an acceptance of the charter of the			
rights of the elderly 			
And thirdly what we want is to prepare a kind of a blue print			
of action at the national level where we need not uproot the people			
from their family but make them live in their families and be productive			
Well I would just like to add here			
Sir			
Most important point the conference will arrive at it 			
The care of the elderly is in the home that is in his own family			
 and in his own community 			
And unless the community and the family participates in the care			
of the old whether he is a disabled or not it will be very			
difficult for any other agencies to take care of it 			
I would also like to quote here that Robert Browning has very			
beautifully said Grow old along with me the best thing yet to			
be 			
Wonderfull 			
Dr Gokhale Dr Gangarade thank you very much for being with us			
in our studios and as you have heard that this vital issue of aging is going			
to be discussed at this conference			
There will be greater international awareness after it 			
And there is also hope for people like me in a couple of hundred			
years when I'm retired it's possible that I'll 			
not be considered as burden or a problem			
But uh still a productive force			
Well thank you very much gentlemen for being with us			
Thank you 			
With the end of the cold war and the dismemberament of the			
Soviet Union there have been many dramatic changes in the			
international scenario 			
One of the healthy developments has been the change in the			
relations between India and Britain 			
As they were our colonial past and after independence a			
number of issues had forward our relations 			
Foremost amongst those was the question of Kashmir 			
Just next month two very significant results are going to take			
place 			
The British Home Secretary their Home Minister that is Mr			
Kenneth Clerk will be coming in the first week of January 			
And this visit will be followed by that of the their			
Prime Minister Mr John Major 			
We have here with us Dr L M Singhavi our High Commissioner			
to Britain 			
He is here for pre-visit consultations 			
And we're going to take this opportunity of exchanging			
some views about the significance of the visit 			
Dr Singhavi how do you view this visit of what one word			
 ?			
These visits represents a remarkable new phase 			
of Indo-British togetherness 			
As the British Foreign Secretary once said we no			
longer wrangle about problems 			
We sit together and resolved them 			
And I think these uh uh that the year and a half 			
that is there had experienced a progressive phase for a qualitative			
change in that relationship 			
We have been trying to resolve problems 			
We are trying to evolve that equation which is durable 			
and meaningful 			
And where we both share or uh view points and we care			
for each others concerns			
So what is the attitude now as one word in			
regard to the Kashmir problem ?			
When I went there I found that the situation was			
considerably confused partly because I think in the Labour Party			
there was an inadequate appreciation of the historical background of			
the legal implications and of the ground situation 			
Today we have a situation when the shadow Foreign Secretary			
 Mr Jack Cunningham called on me some time ago at the High Commission			
 held the press conference and made very positive clear-cut 			
unambiguous statements with regards to Kashmir 			
There is no doubt that they are very much concerned about			
allegation of human rights violations 			
But there is also no doubt that they regard Kashmir as an			
integral part of India 			
But this is very different to what the former shadow 			
Foreign Minister of the Labour Party said after his visit to India 			
He was rather critical about it			
Uh well Mr Jerim Cockson was very critical			
about us before he came here 			
But after he came he had made a considerable change in			
the position that he has taken earlier 			
But I must say in fairness that Mr Jerim Cockson eventually			
came to a position 			
Which is very much more favourable to India than it			
ever was 			
In fact when I went there he used the word occupying part for			
India 			
When I took exception to it yeah he was good enough			
 to say I am extremely sorry that I used that expression 			
On the whole during this period not only the Labour Party			
 not only the ruling part not only the Liberal Party but the			
people as a whole has come to understand our position better 			
They sympathise with our opposition much more and they			
share a lot of our perspective in these matters 			
 Yeah 			
To what extent uh would you attribute this uh to			
England itself now emerging more and more as a multi 			
 multi ethnic community 			
Because this was a common base to me that the British uh 			
government and people are also very concern of containing religious 			
racial and ethnics rights in England 			
And therefore they better understand uh the problems			
countries like India face 			
Uh when uh forces for their own aim try to use religion			
 or language or race to try and divide and create conflict 			
But that's only one of the many dimensions 			
It is an input no doubt			
But I think the more direct input in this whole situation			
is their coming closer towards understanding of our position 			
Therefore it's the question of terrorist 			
I decide in to put my case directly as a case has to be put			
We decided that they must have a full encounter			
with the evidence that we have of the involvement of our neighbouring			
country in the export of terrorrism in the funding and training of			
terrorist 			
And we share that openly with the British government			
Yes this was an issue which was always rankling uh			
between us and the the signing of the Expression Treaty is an			
extremely significant and important one 			
And I am glad that they do realize the importance that we			
 attach to the type of systems perhaps perceived by us and not			
actually happening there 			
There assistants that was being given or at least the 			
Nelson's eye being turned to the activities of terrorist in uh			
in Britain 			
Uh how do you uh evaluate this yourself ?			
No I put before the British government the			
perceptions that both India and Britain are victim states of terrorist			
That both of us have to face the situation in a similar			
manner and that both of us us must collaborate in meeting			
terrorist 			
Now Britain came out clearly large and clear on the			
question of terrorism 			
The question was what do we do about it 			
When I reopened what was regarded as a close chapter on the			
Extradition Treaty 			
And what is more important the agreement on the confiscation			
of terrorist related and drug related ethics 			
I found for the first time when we had prepared the ground			
 and openess and there is activity in Britain 			
And we have established a bi-lateral arrangement which may			
well pave the way for India to contribute to a global regime 			
against terrorism 			
This is very healthy very good 			
There are sir now also to the economic side			
I think that is yeah uh foremost in or mind 			
 We'll have such old ancient economic links with			
 Britain special ones 			
Uh could you give us your own thoughts on this ?			
How do you see increase possibilities of increased 			
investments from uh British Industries ?			
Now I want to put them a little seperate to the NRI 			
Because the NRI's have now become extremely important			
in England 			
And our nationals have really contributed very uh			
creditably to the development of Britain's economy 			
And they're also greatly interested in India 			
Perhaps uh some comments from you on both the sides			
 Yeah 			
Yes uh first let me speak about the NRI and then the main			
stream investment potential from Britain 			
Uh to this acronym NRI I've given I've			
 spelt it out as the national result of India 			
Uh they are a tremendous resource for Indian diplomacy 			
Long ago when I was in Parliament in nineteen sixty-two I			
took up this issue with the government 			
Well the government did not regard it any part of their			
obligation to cultivate them or to regard them as Indians			
Now I felt that these children of mother India must be			
acknowledged because I found that in their heart there was very			
deep love and attachment to India 			
Now NRI's have done well 			
They would be a useful catalyst in our country 			
They would like to have a relationship which enables them to			
stay where they are and to do something for our country which			
they regard also as their mother country 			
Now from that point of view they won't one word a			
nationality			
I have placed several proposals with regard to this			
whole concept to one word nationality and how it can be made			
operational			
I do hope that some decisions should be taken			
before long 			
But the NRI's has a tremendous contribution to make			
both in terms of technology transfer in terms of investments in terms			
of contributing to the general climate for investments in our			
country			
 Yeah 			
I would also say I would also say they have a very			
major role to play in improving Indo-British relations in general 			
 very much because they've become they've 			
become fairly active also on the			
 Very much 			
Yes yes 			
On the political side			
 And I think they're they are a group of			
people whether you call them NRI's or people of Indian origin I			
mean this what you call is debatable 			
But this group are ones which we should pay very much more			
attention to and I I'm glad that we are doing so			
 Yes 			
 That's true I made this my business to cultivate			
them 			
Uh a very large significance uh eternal constituency of			
support 			
Even if I take my job to be a credit to the people of Great Britain			
 they are a segment of that population 			
And in the modern world diplomacy has to relate to people and			
not only to the government 			
And they're a very important positive group for India 			
But that apart the NRI have also one very important			
contribution to make and that is the constant positive projection of			
India among the people they live 			
And that is something which we cannot do on the same scale as			
they can 			
About the other hand the main stream investments here 			
about which I have great enthusiasm and great expectations or			
held that today because of a strong recessionary phase in the			
Europian and the British economy 			
But had to understand that in this recessionary phase you			
cannot have received buoyancy 			
On the other hand for instance when it comes to NRI 			
during the time when our foreign exchange reserves were at the rock bottom			
 ah Britain the sterling area contributed in such an enoromous			
measure and such an unexpectedly large way			
That today from a reserve of one million or less			
which was very small we have a reserve of eight point eight million 			
This is the situation to which NRI have made a very useful			
contribution 			
Now the main stream investors the money managers the			
bankers or one word 			
But it takes a lot of time 			
Britain is not only Britain's financial market is a			
world financial market 			
And we have been able to make considerable impact on			
the city of London on the money managers on the potential			
investors to all thing that they cannot afford to miss the			
opportunity of investments in India 			
Last year Mr Bhandari I've brought a very large group			
 of British investors uhm the top of the shares company			
 with their chairman their managing directors their financial advisors			
then attorney to all see India 			
And they went back with nothing but the most positive			
and optimistic reform 			
It had to take time 			
When this recessional the period of one word is much			
longer yeah but it's happening			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
Well I would have thought may be because there is a recession			
 uh British industries and financial insitutions would be looking our			
for other markets and India			
Yeah they are 			
India is the natural massive market			
And we have very weak advantage as far as Britain is			
concerned that there is the uh the language is not a barrier we			
know each other 			
In fact we still adopt their own standard uh we have a one			
word their judiciary the one word administration therefore			
everything is there very conducive for uh increasing this			
Yes we we and two countries relate very closely to			
each other and that is very important 			
This is tremendous awareness of the thing that the India is a			
natural ally India ia a natural country where to go for investments			
And this is a tremendous help 			
I think during the recessionary phase also the number of			
approvals applied for and granted or industries one word is			
very large 			
But so far as the economic one word is concerned 			
it would have to take a little more time			
And we will have to one word here a little more			
I have also hopes for relocations of industries from Europe			
 into India 			
I am certain that joint ventures between Britain and India would			
be a interesting reality in the world market 			
We will do very well if we established these joint ventures for			
the reasons you just now mentioned 			
But I think you cannot merely add up during a short			
period time play 			
The results of what we've already achieved 			
There is tremendous positiveness in the climate 			
It will take some time before we can uh harvest the crops 			
Which will come out of this uh ma 			
massive efforts that we have made particularly in this 			
Well the most important fact that is the question of the			
climate 			
If it is a climate of understanding and of co-operation of			
good-will of wanting to co-operate with each other 			
 There'll be other exchanges follow automatically			
And I think it is in the interest of both Britain and India			
 that we have a much closer understanding with each other 			
Uh Europe is going in uh for unification			
Here there'll be problems 			
But the unification of Europe uh with Britain being a			
part of it will create uh both problems 			
And I think also opportunities 			
And uh relations with Britain would play very major role			
not only on the bi-lateral side but also in regard to India's 			
co-operation and exchanges with Europe 			
At the same time I think that greater understanding greater			
objectivity in the a few words these are the India and Pakistan			
 is welcome and we see much greater objectivity now 			
This is welcome as such the visits of the Home Secretary and			
the Prime Minister are going to be extremely significant 			
Uh it is also worth noting that even three years ago one			
would not have imagined that the British Prime Minister would be the			
guest of honour at the Republic Day 			
But he is going to be there in nineteen ninety-three 			
I have no doubt that he will receive a very warm welcome 			
And I also sincerely hope that uh these two uh very			
important visits would also pave the way for much greater and more			
intensive economic and other exchanges as also much better			
understanding between India and Britain 			
The accord took place under some very very special			
circumstances 			
To what extent was this this accession has the consent of			
people of the state 			
To what extent it has has the integration of the state into the			
Union being possible ?			
And what have been the deficiency in this uh process of			
integration itself 			
And perhaps uh to examine these uh major question to which			
we must one word others if we are ever to find the solution to			
problems that faces us uh in the state 			
We could not have assembled a better panel of eminent expert 			
To my left is Prof A R Punjabi a well known law scholar			
 from Kashmir University			
Who is currently associated with uh the JNU uh in New			
Delhi 			
To the left of him Prof C P Bhambri a well known			
constitutional expert and political scientist also from JNU 			
And to his left Prof Ravindra Kumar Historian and			
Director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library New Dehli 			
 Let's uh start at the beginning and go back to the			
whole issue of the accession itself before we come down to the			
problems of uh the present 			
At present it is it is uh the anniversary of uh the accession			
Professor Punjabi if I may put it to you this way to what			
extent do you think that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian			
Union in October nineteen forty-seven to what extent did it have the			
consent of the people of the state 			
Well you see this accession took place under various 			
special and typical circumstances 			
On fifteenth of August when two dominion came into existence that			
India and Pakistan people of Kashmir were too struggling to have			
 uh their own government 			
They wanted to end the autocratic rule of Maharaja Hari Singh			
And uh they want wanted to speak			
with someone 			
And the struggle was going on 			
Well in this Independence Act provided the opportunity to 			
the the Prince State to accede to the either domain India or Pakistan			
But the Maharaj of Kashmir was undecided on this issue			
He did not decide and uh he asked for time			
In the mean time he asked for a one word agreement			
 which was agreed to uh Pakistan and India wanted some time and some			
clarifications 			
In the mean time when all these things were going on there			
was suddenly a tribal attack from the across the border of			
Pakistan on Kashmir 			
So this created a one word situation whereby some			
decision had to be taken and uh states defence was involved 			
But at the same time it was not the question of 			
Maharaja alone 			
There was a very popular political party who had launched			
the struggle in the state for say since nineteen thirty-one 			
So therefore uh the accession took place under these			
circumstances 			
Prof Ravindrakumar if I may just uh get to you as a			
Historian how do you uh visualize in this prospect the 			
struggle in Jammu and Kashmir of the National Conference of uh Sheikh			
Abdullah ?			
I mean ho where is this placed			
in the history of our freedom struggle 			
In other words I mean is there a link between the struggle that			
was going on in Jammu and Kashmir and the struggle in rest rest of			
India for liberation from British rule			
Of course there is a very close and integral link			
And I would like to add one or two observations by way of foot			
note to what my friend Riaz has already said in this regard 			
I think the people of Jammu and Kashmir under the leadership of			
Sheikh Abdullah were fighting on two fronts 			
They were fighting the autocratic government of the ruling			
dynasty at the time and the same time they were fighting the British			
in Kashmir as do the rest of South Asia 			
So that it was this dual struggle which was carried on under the			
aegis of Sheikh Abdullah and the National Conference party of those 			
particular days 			
I think it is important to remember that at the same time as 			
the State acceeded to the Indian Union a popular government under the			
leadership of Sheikh Abdullah was created in Shrinagar the capital of the			
state of Jammu and Kashmir			
So that both the struggles in a way came to a successful			
conclusion 			
But uh it is also important to remember here that an assurance was			
given by the uh government in New Delhi 			
As was true in the case of all sub-states say like Junagadh 			
or Hyderabad that the will that the decision of the ruler 			
would be backed at the later stage by an expression of will by the			
people of that state 			
And I think this in a way would make the accession truly			
 one word and truly firm as was done in subsequent years			
Prof Bhambri uh but don't you think I mean on the basis of			
what uh Ravindra just said do you think that though something you			
see over and above distance uh accession in human history there were			
certain special circumstances which uh the other just explained			
And I think uhm perhaps you could throw some light on the fact			
that you see Jammu and Kashmir was treated on a seperate footing and the			
certain assurances that were given which were legal enshrined in a			
special status for Jammu and Kashmir			
In a sense give a very special status to the state 			
Some argue that that is the root of the problem			
 I'll say that this is something which would serve as a			
model for the future 			
Now where exactly do you think I mean what uh if uh was a			
special feature that were enshrined in the constitution were both of			
India as well as the constitution of the Jammu and Kashmir state which			
made the the special status or ensured the special status for Jammu			
and Kashmir 			
Chander as Ravindra Riaz have very clear pointed out that			
instrument of accession was brought under special circumstances to			
provide first the one word foundations to confront the tribal			
raiders 			
At the same time even at that very critical juncture the historical			
developments of the content of struggle in a few words was			
ignored 			
They were always kept uppermost in mind 			
And once this raiders issue is resolved Jammu and Kashmir			
problem not special not particular but specifically in the			
context of historical development would be taken care of by the			
constitutional makers of India which were enshrined under article			
three hundred seventy 			
That is the provisions of accessions and with limited			
powers of the central government especially on the defence and foreign			
affairs would be taken of care of by central government and			
later on the democrate forces in Jammu and Kashmir as represented			
by the popular leaders under Sheikh Abdullah of National Conference			
 would through their own democratic process form a constitution 			
And that constitution will provide them with the beginning of			
democratic involvement of Kashmir society as far as the and a larger			
problems of Indian polity of democracy 			
Which was a construction of democratic technique as part			
of constitutional one or two word it was accomodation of			
special history 			
It was not a concession to call it even special 			
Special means as a significant one word 			
It was not a concesssion it was a very legitimate one word 			
of the historically marked struggle 			
And aspiration of people to be satisfied democratically 			
And hence establishment of democratic polity in Kashmir as a			
first step is under this constitution			
I see that Riaz is getting impatient to one word also			
See I think uh we would like to push we should I think			
take note of two important things that one in nineteen fifty when			
the constitution of India was promolgated 			
Now we have article one of the constitution of India which define			
the critical situation of India			
Right 			
So by virtue of article one of Indian constitution 			
Jammu and Kashmir state was placed in a part B state 			
Because there were A B C D four categories of states 			
And Jammu and Kashmir fell in the category of part B state 			
Uh that is those states which were not directly uh cannot have			
the impression of paramouncy but uh while the result of the			
process of integration 			
And in nineteen fifty-six of course in category B state were			
abolished so Jammu and Kashmir state fell in the category of part A state			
 That's one part of it 			
Second part of it article three seventy which guarantee			
special status under the one word 			
Now as far as article one and is concerned uhm 			
precisely because that article one was being debated in the Constituent			
Assembly 			
Uh B R Ambedkar said that there is one special feature about			
article one Indian constitution that Indian Union is not a volantary			
union 			
Secondly that no unit has the right to secede from the Union			
So keeping you in mind that have article one whether this			
Jammu Kashmir state and the Indian Union one			
Second is this what became perhaps the uh at the root			
of the tension between the state leaders and union leaders was the extent			
of other constitutional one word 			
Because after determining the relationship constitutional			
relationship by means of article one of the Indian Constitution 			
Uh then just as this is quantum relationship 			
But I think uh the quantum relationship was not fully			
defined to what was the problem			
I think there was some difference of perception as well 			
as for as the quantum relationship is concerned 			
You know because I I'm refering to article one because 			
very often that it is made important point of view often 			
And I think that it is perhaps in this context then George 			
Corobel wrote the book uh Danger in Kashmir 			
He was member of UNCIP United Nation Commission India			
and Pakistan 			
He said it is amazing that nobody ever raised this issue			
before Security Council either India or Pakistan 			
That is perhaps the two words has report the article			
one one was recognised 			
Sorry for minor interruption 			
The this question on article one in the Constitution not only by Dr			
Ambedkar remaining others also showed awareness of some of this			
secessionist movement even healthy movement in other parts of the country			
also especially North-East India 			
So the assurance was given to everyone including Jammu and			
Kashmir the secessions are rejected 			
Uhm yeah but it is not 			
 Yeah I I think I think this is an important			
point the one which you're making but I will also refer back to the			
 question of Kashmir having a special status			
I don't think Kashmir had any special status at all in the			
sense that one word state throughout the country there was an			
understanding by the national status who came to power in New Delhi on			
the fifteenth of August nineteen forty-seven			
When the popular will of those who live in the princely state			
 would be affected in the case of Kashmir uh article three seventy			
went as far as saying that in actual Constituent Assembly within the			
framework of article one to really define the precise nature of the			
relationship between Kashmir and the rest of the Indian Union 			
Finally I would think that when that Constituent Assembly made its			
announcement in nineteen fifty-two and fifty-three			
Those announcement as has been suggested by Riaz and one			
word Shah but two words developing and changing uh			
announcement is not meant to be a static anouncement at all			
It was seen as a revolving situation			
 I'm transgressing my role as moderator but I can't do			
not quite agree what your observation on uh you know there have not			
been a special status			
Because after all you see article three seventy 			
And you see from the things that are enshrined in it uh			
such as there being a separate uhm constitution for Jammu and Kashmir			
And some other some symbol of uh that that is there a			
separate emblem uh separate flag and uh			
Of course			
No no I think you see these were uhm uh has was wasn't			
concession it as I said earlier see this could uh many people argue			
that this could serve as a model for for their for their future			
There have been demands from other parts of the country that			
article three seventy should be extended to other places 			
On the other hand there is other tendency which says that this 			
is three seventy is the root of this problem and because we had a			
special relationship with Kashmir the integration of Kashmir with the			
main stream of India was never uh complete			
Chander uh			
Uh how would you uh a few words 			
 A few words 			
But I honestly want to say ke you're			
 misunderstanding my position			
What I'm saying is the communality lay in the			
declaration of the New Delhi leaders 			
That the people's voice would be consulted throughout the			
region of princely states you know 			
Of course the very fact that a Constituent Assembly was given			
to the people of Jammu and Kashmir means giving them uh a special			
status but that special status doesnot at all consent that the place 			
of Kashmir and Jammu and Kashmir within the Indian Union or the 			
inter-media 			
Of course certainly certainly not			
But uh what the focus of uh what we've brought			
perhaps I think you know is the time we suspect has come to see what			
 we've seen as uh happening in Kashmir over the last few years			
Actually I think uhm very very sad because in a sense that			
Kashmir uh state have a special place in the heart of most Indians			
And to see what's happened to the Valley 			
 It's something which you know pain all uh 			
those committed to Democracy and federalism in this country 			
And considering that those indeed certain special provision made			
for Jammu and Kashmir 			
Why ?			
Why did this happen I mean what where 			
really we went wrong 			
Count down to the Ayodhya climax is on 			
And if you will stand for a mixed metaphor the 			
 everything is about to reach a crescendo in the next 			
four or five days			
And we have in this panel uh Mr Soli Sorabjee a			
very well known lawyer and Mr P Upendra member of Parliament			
I wish we to balance the panel we also had somebody			
 from the establishment and uh a member from the BJP that			
could have probably made for a more more meaningful discussion 			
But Soli why don't we get down to the the basic point the			
legal aspect of it 			
Uh the Supreme court has set certain things uh just to 			
to clarify things for the viewers what is that the Supreme Court had said			
 and what are the implication of what it has said ?			
The Supreme Court has restrained any construction activity			
 on the site 			
Be it of a permanent nature or a temporary nature 			
The Supreme Court has also directed that no construction			
material or construction machinery should be brought at the sight 			
At the same time having regard to the religious sentiments of			
the people 			
Having regards to the fact the sculpture about the Ram the			
Supreme Court has clarified that this restraint will not prevent 			
karseva in the form of singing of bhajan and			
certain religious versions 			
And that this part of the order the Supreme Court has emphasised			
should be publicised and made clear to the kar sevak 			
So that norm of the highest court of the land has prohibited and			
what it is two words 			
That is the net effect of the Supreme Court order as it is 			
today in force			
But even as you and I are talking uh there is a matter			
being before the supreme court now just now yes and 			
 which is which which which is on what			
basically focussing on that issue			
 Yes 			
Well the petition is there I think you want to			
know what contengency plan the state government has 			
Because assuming sincerity on the part of the state government 			
and assuming that they mean when they give an undertaking that they will			
see that the mosque is not damaged no construction activity takes place			
But the both thing they are out of hand 			
Because after all all depends upon how many karsevak			
 gather 			
What sort of speeches are made by various leaders there ?			
Suppose it leads to some kind of a frenzy or they result in a			
situation thereby the supreme court order cannot be comply 			
one word even despite the best efforts of the government 			
Then what are the plans the government has I think that's 			
the application which is being argued at the movement 			
 What're the plans they have ?			
How do they want to prevent any damage to the mosque			
What is your reading Mr Upendra because uh Kalyan			
Singh has said various things on this on this issue the chief			
minister of U P ?			
Uh do you get a cacophony coming out of the BJP			
 camp ?			
Or do you do you see a co-herent line of action being			
outlined ?			
No there doesn't appear to be very co-herent line of action			
 even among themselves 			
Uh different tones are being heard 			
Apparently there is a difference of opinion also among the			
 leaders of the BJP Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal			
 and others uh			
As it is that must be within the Congress			
 camp also I mean there must be difference of opinion			
But more or less here the issue is very clear that 			
the mosque should be protected and the karseva should			
not be done in violation of the court's order 			
This was on this side the line of action is very clear			
Uhm 			
But on the other side the matter has been complicated			
with the supreme courts effective intervention 			
And probably now the BJP the Vishva Hindu			
Parishad the RSS and the others involved in this are			
in a fix to decide what to do 			
They can't abandoned the karseva straight away			
And there has to be some action as announced by them 			
Because by announcing the karseva even before			
the talks have ended even before the final round of talks are over			
on the November eight 			
I feel they have got themselve into trouble inavoidable			
trouble 			
Had they waited for the final round probably this situation would			
have been avoided 			
And today a responsible particular leadership I have			
great respect for the leaders of the BJP who are no			
doubt patriots 			
They are very clear minded 			
And the BJP the major opposition party in			
the parliament running four state governments 			
For they can't turn down and say we don't uh accept the courts			
order			
So we'll defy the court orders 			
 That's one predicament they are in 			
At the same time they have to keep up their own mandate of			
building the temple and going ahead with the construction 			
So they're in a dilemma			
Yes just now 			
And two words 			
Dilemma sorry one word go ahead			
Yeah			
Now it requires all the political sagacity on their part to			
get out of the situation and uh I must say appreciate the effective			
intervention of the Supreme Court 			
 They've tried to save the situation both for the			
government and the the the other party 			
And one should take advantage of this position and wriggle			
out of this situation			
I don't know how they will do it in the next few days 			
Do you agree with me that their intention now is to expand the			
 the the whole uh arena of uh shall we say contest and now			
mm Mr Advani is going to start from Kashi Kashi Vishvanath 			
and I think Dr Murali Manohar Joshi is starting his Rath			
Yatra from Mathura and they all converging converging in uhm			
 Ayodhya on a certain date 			
Is this do you think they're widening the area of			
contention or is this the only uh diversionary move that they have			
 ?			
No they they did a lot of explaining also both for the			
people and their cadres 			
Uh in fact all they have to accept the supreme court orders and			
turn down the uh contest and uh turn down the action 			
They have to explain it to the people			
Probably that is the part of is this part of their			
campaign probably these people have are going round the from			
the state 			
But uh if you analyse the situatiion in its entirety two			
years back when Mr name government fell on this very same			
issue 			
The main issue was how to protect the mosque and today 			
the it has the problem has been extended outside the mosque 			
to the land acquired by the U P U P government on which they want			
to do the karseva 			
But the already problem has been now uh extended to outside			
the this			
 Let's one word Soli the other other area			
Soli there is another case before the Allahabad High Court 			
On the acquisition of the land and the expectation was that a			
judgement should come before the Dharam Sansad of the force			
 uhm and therefore the one word 			
But apparently they I they have been uh now they			
are going to get the judgement only on the seventh 			
 Is is is that your is that your 			
understanding			
 Uhm 			
Well I don't know about fix case but in their acquisition			
proceeding the acquisition proceedings have been challenged on the ground			
that the land is not really acquired for a public purpose development of the			
tourism			
Uhm uhm			
 It's challenged on the ground that it is for ulterior			
purpose			
But Syeed what I want to a			
Why did they arrange that			
The fact is that these orders are passed in interim			
nations 			
The Allahabad high court has passed this order in it gives a			
decision 			
And they've been one word December but it may			
be soon thereafter 			
So I don't see there should be any difficulty on the part of any			
responsible political leader in complying with the supreme court orders			
which they do not construct till that time 			
And in the mean time as Upendrajee said there is a dilemma created			
by their own uh uh doings and action which very well they were very			
respectable way of getting out of the dilemma by complying with the			
supreme court's order 			
Because supreme court has announced us to its not its not			
complete this of the karseva 			
The karsevak's aspirations also can be			
fulfill they don't feel frustrated that they have it will 			
build up that they are going to karseva 			
Okay have a karseva in a symbolic form 			
Held in this particular manner 			
My uh problem is that why does I say we do not dump the			
sincerity of any of the person but suppose by their action or omissions			
they allow a situation to be created whereby the protection of the mosque			
may become very difficult 			
What I am trying to drive at is that there is still the			
responsibility on the part of the central government also to see that			
the mosque is protected lest any untoward incident may lead to unleashing			
of passions and argument 			
 The state the state government in fact has			
complained that you've been rushing in forces without taking the			
state government into confidence			
What is the constitutional position of that one ?			
Well that it is a debatable point			
Formally there was a provision in the constitution I think it			
was article two fifty-seven A I may be mistaken I think it was that 			
which authorise the deployment of military or other arm forces in the			
state 			
Now that has been deleted 			
But at the same time there is another constitutional provision			
which makes it the duty of the Union to protect the state against the			
external aggression which is not here at all uhm uhm or			
internal disturbance that also one word will know internal			
distrurbance or to see that the government of the state is carried on in			
accordance with the provisions of the constitution 			
Now one of the provisions of the constitution certainly is that the			
order of highest court has to be respected 			
If you do not respect the highest court's order if you			
flop the order of the supreme court then it is very arguable that you are			
not carrying on in accordance to the provisions of the constitution and that			
may enable the central government to take the forces			
But as I said I would not like to be dogmatic about it 			
But it's not a question if I can say so Syeed on			
constitutional provision interpretation			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm uhm			
The whole question is to see that the whole things are very			
subject matter of the dispute if I may say so is not damage or destroyed			
when the decision is given 			
Right			
No there is another point which I want to add here 			
On this very point today the Home Minister made a clarification in			
the Rajya Sabha 			
Uhm uhm			
He said that the Utter Pradesh government was			
informed of the deployment of this additional forces in the state			
 			
 That's why I don't think there is any scope for			
controversy			
No that mean it is a it's 			
consent was not taken as a consent is necessary as I've said but			
their one or two words really get great 			
 But that a few words it's not			
uh two words 			
As far as that prior consent should be taken			
The state government must be informed central can move its			
forces wherever it want it wants 			
But deployment and usage must be with the consent of the state			
government 			
 That's very clear 			
Now the other question which you in fact did not answer 			
answer fully Soli that this act interim order on the land acquisition			
Now supposing this the high court says okay uh it it			
was a you did acquired the land for the right purposes and we agree			
with you 			
Thereafter but the purpose for which the land was acquired was			
tourism and religious tourism and so on and so forth			
But if taking advantage of that you go ahead and do 			
karseva then are you violating a court order even so ?			
You know yeah the question is 			
depends on the terms of the court order 			
If the court order has restrained construction activity 			
 uhm uhm till the decision is given then you violate the court			
order if you do construction activity			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm			
But Syeed I think the crux of the matter is and 			
that's another thing which I think we should all apply our minds to 			
about why cannot the highest court either by way of a reference or under			
article one thirty-eight by enlarging jurisdiction uhm 			
decide that the basic issue 			
Because now the controversy is narrowed 			
Now the issue is a historical fact was there a temple on			
the site ? 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm uhm			
Was the temple destroyed ?			
And has the mosque been built on that site after detroying the			
temple ?			
Because as far as I'm understood the muslim			
leadership has also accepted the position that if it is established 			
 uhm uhm that there was a temple and it was destroyed then the			
mosque has no business to be on that place 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Now that's an issue which is capable of judicial			
determination 			
I can't understand people saying court can't decide that that			
is something about religious 			
We are not here trying to ask to determine the birth place of			
Rama or whether he was there or not there nothing of the kind			
Just a historical fact which can be established one way or the			
other on the basis of evidence and 			
 Now if we go back on that point			
 I if last week I think it was that the whole debate			
started			
Whether one point reference can be made to the supreme court ?			
Mr Boris Yeltsin of Russia had an extremely successful			
visit to India last week 			
And such were the one word reception he got in the			
central hall of Praliament when he addressed that August body that			
people were asking whether he is more popular in India than he is			
back in Russia 			
During his visit he signed ten agreements 			
And it appeared that the old relationship between India and			
the Soviet Union which has collapsed with that counrty 			
Now there appeared to be a new beginning with the new Russia 			
Now obviously Russia is not the Soviet Union 			
 India's relationship with Russia has to be on a new			
basis uh completely different basis from that with the old Soviet			
Union 			
To discuss this we have with us two distinguished panelist 			
They are Mr Jagjeet Singh who is the director of the			
Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis 			
We have Mr Vijay Karan former Director of the CBI 			
Jagjeet tell us over all in the ter te 			
 terms of structuring a new relationship between the two			
countries 			
In terms of the totality of the vision where do you think we			
stand with Russia ?			
And how is this different from the old relationship with the Soviet			
Union ?			
Well I think obviously as you mentioned very rightly 			
 tha that there is something we also need to			
keep reminding ourselves that there is no Soviet Union 			
Uh this is uh not totally a new country but substantively 			
new leadership new system new approaches have and which has 			
substantial amount of domestic problems the economic social political			
Uh in the larger context of course it remains one of the 			
key uh great powers of the world much depends on how it's			
 own cohesiveness in all respects shapes up 			
Uh but what what would have imagined uh Swami that uh given the			
nature of the previous relationship and the fact that most of the people			
still are similar and the some fundemental uh			
geo-political realities 			
In fact this sort of visit should have taken place much earlier			
But still I think uh uhm coming as it does it is time does			
reflect hopes return to realism in Moscow as well as a certain amount of			
 fresh thinking on both sides to to look at this relationship and try			
to build it up uh with the changed circumstances on the changed			
parametres 			
Yes in fact I think the internal affairs ministry had			
made an official announcement about Boris Yeltsin coming almost one year ago			
 That's right			
And he never came and it was a matter of some embarassment 			
And I think a very large number of people had come to the			
conclusion look this is a terrible mistake Mr Boris Yeltsin			
 no longer heads a super power he now head merely a poor country			
 and a one word of Europe 			
That his main priority right now is to get as much aid and other			
systems as he can get from the USA from Europe investment if he			
can from Japan 			
And that he is now going to be in the struggle to re-establish			
himself with the West and Japan and that he is no longer going to			
worry about old geo-political strategy which made India a national			
ally of the Soviet Union 			
And yes now that he has come in a sense people are once again			
 getting a whip of old nostalgia saying haan 			
 that even if it's not quite the same love affair can we			
atleast hold hand 			
Uh Mr Vijay Karan how do you see this new affair developing			
 ?			
 Haan 			
Well I agree with you there were there was a state of			
uncertainty before he came because of the announcement that he will come			
earlier but he didn't come 			
At least that uncertainty has been re 			
removed and his visit has shown a certain degree of			
keenness on the part of the Russian to continue good relations with India			
Otherwise I doubt them first 			
The Russians would have been so forth the Russian President for			
instance so forth right on India's territorial integrity on			
 the Kashmir on Pakistan etcetera			
So I think also I would rather take the first step Russia			
when you think in terms of uh may be uh another regional grouping in			
in the long term if it one word off			
The emerges of any other threat in Islamic law emerging in the			
 one word in the horizon or the western powers again there are			
some problem			
So may be they wants want to keep			
India on the right side you know good relationship India a good			
relationship with India as as a long term measure 			
It is interesting point you're raising 			
Alright suppose Russia feels some kind of threat from an Islamic			
block what role would it expect India to play then 			
Well may be if let's say an Islamic block			
emerges and it it becomes enemical to India because of say			
Pakistan or Bangladesh or together they			
Otherwise I do not see an Islamic block really posing a			
serious threat to India			
But because of Pakistan and Bangladesh if it poses a threat to			
India and if it also poses a threat to Russia than there are there is			
we can do something one word 			
Jagjeet do you think I mean there was an old 			
ge geo-political relationship based on the USSR			
as a global power yes actually Russia is not a global power			
 and yet there is a point which Vijay has just said about the			
potential of trouble in Central Asia 			
Uh which is an area which so to speak divide Russia from			
India 			
Do you think this have a serious issue uh which has agitating			
minds in Moscow and does it have anything to do with the new relationship ?			
 Yes 			
Uhm well yes and n n no 			
 in the sense that yes there is a different sort of perception about			
Central Asia uh let's say about a year ago in Moscow 			
Uh but I don't think that's the reason for uh the 			
type of attempt to build up a new relationship			
It is perhaps just one more factor in that 			
Uh the the fundamental has not really change 			
Russia in fact they are not one or two words global			
power just any way except the United States			
From from their point of view especially particularly in that			
respect so 			
Uh that way it is not too difficult to look at Russia uh			
more in the nature of uhm another great country uh great power 			
whatever terms you want to use it which has not only its own interest			
but which needs to co-operate with the larger number of uh centres of			
powers and areas and regions uh then just Japan uh North America and			
and West Europe and that's realism I was talking of			
That there is a return to realism which then uh makes the			
whole thing possible to establish a new relationship 			
Central Asia is certainly an important point 			
But not that that that's the driving force I I won't			
say it's the driving force 			
Well I said that because I think the Russian President did			
mentioned that may be Russia China and India could emerge as			
a force together and could work together that's what he			
mentioned in the press conference			
Well much depend that one word certain significant			
 You'll know that the number of people who were very			
upset in India with the end of the cold war threat 			
 We'll now be in a uni-polar world dominated by the USA			
Alas Rus the Soviet Union is no			
more 			
Some of the thing to be getting excited about Russia I think or			
perhaps we will no longer be a uni-polar world perhaps we'll be			
able to use Russia or some other people 			
Ally with them or with you're searching a broader			
 group along with China 			
But does it is is that realistic ?			
I mean is there any sense in which the uni-polarity of the world			
I mean I don't think the world is really uni-polar but			
clear 			
 To the extent 			
Right to the extent that the the USA is substantial 			
doc uh if not do not completely dominant power 			
Do you think Russia can be used by us in any sense			
 to break whatever dominancy USA may have ?			
Well first of all uh uh as you've said I mean 			
I'm one of the people who believes that there was never this thing			
called a uni-polar world			
I one or two words 			
Except the United States always always even during the			
cold war held the primacy amongst states and that primacy continues 			
And the question was Soviet Union has uh created a capability			
mostly military to countervail that that one			
So that's one that has disappeared 			
What he take the military power and the balance of power			
unfortunately was being seen in terms of military power			
Once you take that factor away then you will start looking at			
the uh strategic and security economic political interest of states 			
Uh I personally if I think which which we're which mean			
inclined to look at this issue from the point of view can we use a			
country of against different country			
I I think there are natural areas on which co-operation			
will take place whether the scope of co-operation is greater let us			
say between Russia and India than it could be between Aryo -			
Russia and United States or India and the United States 			
Uh if the the whole uh thing is there is in a way uh			
you know prosperity has become one of the new urgent necessity			
throughout the world in Russia and India and in whole of Asia and			
even in the United States for that matter 			
And that's been altering the the whole structure 			
I think that we need to look at the whole situation more in			
terms of areas on which co-operation will continue and areas on which 			
 they there will be differences of opinion 			
Our challenges are really how best to strengthen the areas of			
co-operation whether it is United States or with Russia or China or Japan or			
whatever 			
And to ensure that the areas of differences or divergences 			
 do not are not allowed to become uh sources of			
controversial matter that's that's the only way of I look			
at it			
Yes fine			
I mean as it's very very clear that there is no			
sense in which India can aligned itself with Russia against the USA			
I mean Jagjeet has gone out of his way to say any friendship			
 we've is not you can not be aimed against anybody else			
 Haan 			
Okay lets get to some nuts and bolt of the agreement			
signed here and of the specific policy statements made by Yelstin here			
The obvious one is Kashmir 			
Earlier there was considerable uncertainty as to what was going			
to be Russia's new position 			
We had even indicated if I'm not mistaken sometime ago 			
are don't expect that we shall continue what the Soviet			
Union use to do 			
And yet it would appear during his visit here unambiguously			
came out with support to the Indian position 			
Two questions first does it make any difference ?			
In other words given that the USA has given one word			
 to India's position various other all security council were			
driven to India's position 			
Does it really make much of a difference that Mr Yelstin has			
 one word around to one word 			
Question question number two uh since this is clearly a message			
in trying to get through to us 			
What is their willingness which take the climate which we can			
capitalize on ?			
Mr Vijay Karan			
Yeah I think that the first question that is about uh			
Doesn't matter			
Uhm the fact matter because you can't uh wish away I mean			
the Soviet Union is not irrelevent I mean it's one mustn't			
obtained that after the break up of the Soviet Union Russia has become			
irrelevent			
As you mentioned it's still a strong military power 			
because as member of the United uh Security Council that does count			
in the world			
It might be weak economically			
 A few words it's own problem			
 A few words 			
And uh apart from the Russian the American the			
American question is there on what they want from Pakistan for instance			
Pakistan has I mean U USA 			
has sent a signal to Pakis a clear signal to Pakistan on terrorism			
If a similar signal can go from the Sovi 			
from Russia to Pakistan			
 That's a few words 			
Yes it is good uh I think we need to move on to 			
one word somewhere to centre pace of the visit 			
This should be the resolution of the rupee 			
 rubel dispute between the two countries 			
And I think if this had not been resolved co-operation and			
trade co-operation military measures would have been held up 			
And this is such a complex affair that it might be a mistake			
to get too deeply into it 			
But as I understand this extremely complex affair roughly			
twenty percent uh of the increase in the rupee value			
which should have taken place after December thirty first nineteen			
ninety-one has not taken place 			
To that extent there is a kind of rise of thirty percent of the			
debt which nobody is talking about 			
 One word were given not talked about 			
Of the debt that remains roughly one third has been 			
reschedule on extremly softer terms 			
Where our debt servicing liability comes down by about two			
third 			
This has been held as an arrangement that is fair to all and			
 will arrange will enable our bilateral relations now to go ahead on			
the trade side on the credit side on the defence side 			
Another budget another hike 			
The Railway budget for next year has proposed a ten percent			
increase in both passenger fares and freight rate 			
The railways of course justify this increase on the ground 			
that their input cost in the last one year have gone up 			
And despite the fact and despite their efforts to improve			
their productivity over last year they contend that an increase has			
become necessary 			
And unless they do this they will not be able to maintain their			
 operations as also provide resources for fresh investment 			
Not many of course would share this perception 			
There would be usual criticism that the great hike will be			
inflationary 			
The cost of production will go up 			
There will be more burden on the consumer as prices of essential			
commodities will go up 			
And of course the rail traveller would have to shell out 			
at least ten percent more for travelling 			
The budget of course raises a number of issues whether 			
the hike is justified ?			
Whether the railways can actually reduce the the			
 that prices in tariff ?			
Can they accomodate by improving their effeciency ?			
Are they using their resources efficiently ?			
Are they deploying deploying their funds in the manner 			
which suits the priorities of the railway and the country at			
large ?			
Are the railways investing enough to take care of the growing			
needs of the economy ?			
These and similar related issues we will look at in			
this discussion today 			
We have a distinguished panel 			
And on my right is member traffic of the railway board			
 Mr Shrivasan Mr A N Shukla chairman railway board 			
On my le on my left is 			
Mr K N Thakur former secretary planning commission and advisor			
 a principal advisor to the planning commission and Mr P S Anand 			
who is the financial commission for the railways 			
Uh Mr Shukla may I may I begin this			
discussion with you 			
 That considering the fact that the rate of			
inflation in the last one year has gone down 			
How do you actually justify the increase in freight rate ?			
Particularly freight rate because last year when the rate of			
price rise was much higher you had increased rate by seven point			
five percent 			
This year when the rate of inflation has come down the freight			
has gone up by ten percent 			
Surely your input cost the must have gone up by a			
much lower percentage 			
Then how do you explain it ?			
Mr Bharati the railway finances have traditionally 			
been met from two basic sources 			
One is the budgetory support which the railways have been			
getting from the government 			
And the other is internal resource generation 			
Over the last four or five years we have added a third force 			
and that is the uh sail of bond of the Indian Railway Finance			
Corporation 			
So basically these are the three sources that we have available to			
us 			
Now you might be aware of the fact that the budgetory support 			
in the fifth five year plan was of the order of seventy-five percent			
This slowly went down to about sixty percent in the sixth plan			
And it has been steadly diminishing 			
We did come up with this new source that is the railway bond			
But unfortunately because of the you know the the			
unusual market conditions which have prevailed over the last one year or			
so 			
It was not being possible to sell these bonds although we have			
increased the the uh the interest rate of the bond from nine percent that			
which we used to sell them earlier to ten and a half percent 			
But there are just one word to this particular movement			
Therefore when the budgetory support is diminishing it was			
uh thirty-four percent in ninety-two ninety-three 			
And it is going to fall to just fourteen point seven percent in			
ninety-three ninety-four 			
We have no option 			
But to raise internal resources if we are going to provide the			
necessary infrastructure for transport for the country the			
industry of the country as a whole to develop 			
There are no soft option 			
Mr Shukla you are you are suggesting that uh indirectly			
suggesting that uh the increase in freight rate and passenger fares 			
is more linked to the fact that budgetory support has gone down 			
rather rather than to the fact that your input cost has gone up 			
Are you saying that there is no link between the cost of operations			
and the rate in passenger fare increased ?			
No there is a direct link 			
And I'll give you a very brief account of how our			
input cost have gone up over the last one year 			
That is in this this very financial year 			
The general increase in prices for materials and fuel 			
has been up the other for ten percent 			
The electric tariff that we've been paying has gone up			
as much as sixteen percent 			
And staff cost that the DA uh uh the DA component of			
the staff salary has gone up by twenty percent 			
And of course we have to make the usual three percent provision for			
increments 			
Now if you add all this together 			
And add to it the fact that we are planning to to increase 			
the traffic output both in terms of passengers as well as goods by			
something like six percent 			
It would amount to an additional requirement of funds of the			
order of something like sixteen to seventeen percent really 			
Now if you give a look at the figures last this this 			
year's already working expenses and the proposed ordinary working			
expenses for ninety-three ninety-four you'll find that there is			
just a thirteen percent increase 			
Which means that we have a short some three to four percent			
 of the additional cost by higher productivity by cost cutting			
 and by various means			
There is another efficiency factor which I would like to mention at			
this very point of time that is the operating issue 			
The operating the issue of the the input cost divided by			
the income 			
In ninety ninety-one this was ninety-two percent and			
ninety-one ninety-two it came down to eighty-nine point five percent 			
In ninety-two ninety-three we expect to get eighty-seven			
percent though we had budgeted for eighty-seven point seven percent 			
And our planning for ninety-three ninety-four is going to be 			
eighty-three percent 			
So it is a combination of cost cutting and resource			
mobilization whereby we intend to generate the funds that we'll 			
need for investing into the transport infrastructure 			
 Mm Mm Mr Thapar would			
you do you buy this argument that the railways have done enough to			
 cut down their cost 			
Uh the economic survey of for this year			
 in fact mentioned that labour productivity in the railways is			
very low 			
And considering that it accounts for over fifty percent of			
their cost of operation 			
Do you think there is hope for making more improvements and			
containing the increase in trade and passenger hike 			
I think Mr Bharati the fundamental question is what Mr			
Shukla was mentioning 			
This particular budget to my perception marks a			
water-shed so far as the role of the state is concerned in the			
development of the infrastructure 			
It also marks a water-shed so far as the pricing policy is			
concerned 			
It appears that the state has forsaken its role for the			
development of transport infrastructure and that of the railways 			
The figures which Mr Shukla mentioned they tell a story 			
which is very important and which gives a message that hitherto 			
what was funded by the state will now has have 			
 to be funded by an organization 			
This raises the basic issue whether the distortions in the			
past whether the railways as an instrument of the government will be			
able to absorb that and at what cost 			
 Can we can we separate these two			
issues 			
I mean on the one hand you can emphasis the let us say the			
extra budgetary constraint on the railways that is the role of the state			
 and the link of the central budget and the railway budget 			
And second the equally important point of efficiency 			
Now coming to the efficiency uhm uh it			
appears that the rate that the transport output has been increasing 			
but the productivity percent has not been increasing to mention it 			
There is a scope for the improvement 			
There is always the scope for the improvement in what manner it			
will take place over there that is one or two words 			
 Uhm 			
 Could you could you give some specific			
suggestion 			
The railways have to make sure that the technological 			
upgradation the pace of upgradation has to be accelerated 			
Unfortunately we have hithereto all along concentrated on			
 uh calling a particular path and that is we send around the			
teams			
We we have a laborous process of uh acquisition of technology			
Now the technology cycle are shrinking all over the world 			
By the time we wake up to take up a particular equipment 			
it's quite likely it has become an one word 			
But uh you know the fact that you are linking efficiency			
with modernization it actually poses a dilemma 			
You cannot modernize unless you get more resources			
The railways will turn around and say okay we have to raise the			
passsenger price and we have to raise freight price if we want us to			
modernize 			
 One word I started at the begining Mr Bharti that			
when I mentioned that the state seems to be observing its role 			
of development of infrastructure			
You mean the railway should be continu 			
 should continue to be subsidised by the central budget 			
 It's not a question of subsidise 			
It is a question of state participating in the developmental			
activities 			
After all the railways are there to serve the national purpose			
We also know that there are historical distortions for instance 			
the uni gauge which we're talking of it is a multigauge of the past			
 which was built over there 			
We also know that the railway system was developed basically in			
the uh uh pre-nineteen forty-seven period for the export of the			
goods by the Britishers from the ports 			
If you see the sweep of the railway net-hold it is largely oriented			
towards the ports 			
There are no connectors in between 			
Now at the same time the railways have a dilemma they are			
passing through a phase of technological change 			
 You're changing from steam to diesel diesel to electric			
Now in this particular period if the state can 			
say that they are withdrawing themselves and leaving it to the 			
totally at the mercy of the organization itself to fend 			
And I'm afraid it will be very short sighted policy 			
And the important thing is what will be the one word 			
effect of the of this policy on the organization that's a			
very important point			
And I think we need to be able to talk about it the			
impact of that 			
What is the the railways point of view ?			
Would they like to eliminate all this subsidies ?			
Would they argue that the centre should bear all the			
subsidies ?			
How is it affecting their cost of operation ?			
How is it hindering their ability to contain the increase in 			
uh trade and passenger fare ?			
You see it is in this context that uh we have been			
able to persue the government to agree to uh withdrawing subsidies			
 on some of the commodities on which we have been traditionally giving			
subsidies for the last several years 			
There were there was sixteen commodities in which the			
subsidies were being given 			
And this year we are withdrawing the subsidies on four such			
commodities 			
I think that as Mr Thapar just said unless various means			
can be found to centrally fund the development of the railways 			
we will have no option but to resort to reducing the subsidies 			
and to plan to generating funds on our own 			
Of course it is very correctly said that our efficiency factors			
have to be looked at very closely 			
We are looking at them very firstly 			
We are trying to improve the effiiciency			
I will give you one example our productivity of man power			
 in terms of one word which was at around two hundred and			
forty-four traffic unit per employee in eighty eighty-one today stands at			
three hundred and sixty-seven traffic units per employees			
That is just one of the efficiency indicated and this is the			
result of continuous efforts to upgrade the quality of the man power			
 and to to to to increase the proportion of the			
output versus the input 			
Likewise that it is a fact that equipments arrears have been a			
major work of our not being able to achieve as much as we would			
have like to achieve 			
And we are tackling this on a on a I would say on a mission			
basis 			
Could you could you tell our viewers that what would be			
the impact on the price of essentials uh as a result of the withdrawl of			
these subsidies ?			
Because you have withdrawn subsidies on uh essential items			
like food grains pulses sugar oil uh what should be the price infact			
It has these measures it is it is not as			
Why should the common man have to pay more for these			
I I'll give you a few examples 			
For a litre of kerosene oil for for a litre he'll 			
have to pay three point to seven paisa more per litre			
That that's total impact 			
For uh cement it is two rupees and			
twelve paisa per sack of fifty kilogram pack 			
For uh coal the increase is three three point three			
seven paisa per kilogram 			
Uh tea eleven paisa per kilogram 			
The the the heaviest impose has been on sugar which is			
twenty-one paisa per kilogram 			
Now that is the order of impact that this is going to have 			
But isn't twenty one paisa 			
pretty substantial 			
Anything that rate should be a very more element per kilogram 			
 On 			
No but the fact is that sugar has been very heavily			
subsidised in terms of transport 			
Whereas I do not think that who is good as far as the total			
compensation is concerned to the consumer 			
And I do not think that the railway should be called upon to			
bear more than their share of subsidising the product 			
We have been bearing our share 			
What is the what is the centre's argument 			
against uh compensating for these subsidies ?			
No in fact the centre the centre is looking at it very			
closely 			
And I'm hoping that that is the discussion which we			
have had with the centre there might be a certain amount of relief			
forthcoming for some of these essential commodities			
But that we have to wait and see as to what they are able to			
do for us 			
Mr Anand don't you think that 			
You see we have we have got caught in very vicious circle 			
You increase frieght rates that pushes up the price of steel			
and coal and petroleum 			
And prices when prices of these goods go up you have 			
you're compel to increase uh your prices of weight 			
And this keeps on happening year after year 			
And we have actually witness them in last two in last two			
years this inter linkage between administered prices that when			
one price is increased everything else goes up and a chain reaction			
follow 			
So don't you think by actually pushing up your freight rate by ten			
percent you are not harming the cause of the economy ?			
 That could you not have made some effort to really			
restrain these price increase ?			
Actually the freight increase contribute very little to the			
price rise 			
 There're over fifteen thousand primary health centres			
and sub-centres in the country 			
 There're over one hundred thousand sub-centres 			
located scattered throughout the country 			
Life expectancy has gone up from thirty-six to around fifty-six			
Today health care is available in urban and rural areas 			
Plague and small-pox have been eradicated 			
Malaria tuberculosis and cholera controlled 			
The general death rate has come down from twenty-seven per thousand			
 to eleven per thousand 			
Infant mortality has declined sharply 			
Much has been done 			
Much more remains to be done 			
How far are we from our national goal of health for all			
 by the year two thousand A D 			
What new programmes are being evolved ?			
What is the present state of public health care in India ?			
These are some of the questions that we would like to put to our			
distinguished guest the Union Health Secretary Sri R			
Srinivasan who is with us in the studio right now			
 We've also said to you a little while ago that we were			
expecting the presence of Dr G K Vishvakarma Director General of Health			
Services			
Unfortunately Dr Vishvakarma has not been able to join us			
He has possibly been held up somewhere 			
Mr Srinivasan thank you very much for joining us yeah			
 on the morning show			
 We're honoured and delighted to have you with us 			
So first of all may I on behalf of the family of the morning			
show congratulate you on your election as Chairman of the Executive Board			
of the World Health Organisation 			
This is a tribute to you personally and to the country that 			
you represent 			
 Yeah 			
 First the country especially			
Thank you very much sir 			
Mr Secretary are you satisfied with the present state of health			
care in India ?			
 That's a very large question and uh 			
You know let's get this in perspective 			
I think you know every sixth human being is an Indian 			
Uhm uhm 			
So if you're going to get our health of India			
alright we're going to do an enormous of might of work for the			
health of the world 			
And uh in forty years something fantastic has been done as far as			
health care facilities are concerned 			
 That's been an area of development 			
As you said earlier you know we certainly made a tremendous			
impact in death rates 			
Infant mortality has certainly reduced much more today 			
Death rates have also tended to decline but not to the			
extent we wanted 			
But of the sight of disease 			
Our diseases are broadly diseases due to infection 			
Diseases due to malnutrition and life-style 			
 We've made a good bit of dent into that two diseases have			
been touched 			
Diseases relatable to malnutrition is part of general economic			
development 			
As far as life-style is concerned like cancer sex diseases and			
so on 			
But this is an urban phenomenon largely 			
If you ask me what are the brighter parts so far 			
I mean certainly we've done well in leprosy 			
Every fourth leprosy patient in the world is an Indian 			
And every fifth leprosy patient in India is a child 			
 It's very enormous burden 			
And by the year two thousand it may not may 			
be possible to eradicate it 			
 It's certainly it would be possible to have a			
tremendous dent because of the multi drug therapy 			
Which gurantees you complete freedom from leprosy in about two			
and half years 			
Mr Secretary you've talked about the brighter spots			
on the health being kamiyan kaun kaun si hai ?			
 Kamiyan to saheb thi hai ek to hai 			
malaria ke bare mein 			
Malaria ko hamne hataya 			
Ab kafi door tak chalagaya sirf ek wapas agayi do teen			
karan 			
Ek karan hai jo daviyaan pesticides thi			
unki resistance ho gayi uhm 			
doosra hai ke water bodies development se chalti bahut 			
one word hote jarahe 			
Aur infected log to itne migration			
 hota hai labour population ka 			
infection ek jagah se doosri jagah parasite chala			
jata hai 			
As you probably know malaria is different from mosquito			
available			
 Uhm 			
Yeah 			
There may be mosquitoes with no malaria 			
But when the mosquito carries the parasite and injects it into			
the blood system then the man becomes infected 			
And there is another aspect I think people who understand and			
want to discuss about public health issues in India must remember this 			
that for the poor people health is not a priority 			
Priority is illness 			
And how to get out of sickness as soon as possible 			
So if you don't have the full regimen of medicine you get			
back incompletely cured 			
Malaria comes back then			
You raised this question of about the poorer sections			
of society			
Now in every developing country I presume there is a certain			
dicotomy between the level of health care available in the rural areas			
 gramin kshetra mein jis prakar ke haspatal hain ye health			
care hai aur jo urban areas milte hai 			
Why does one have the impression that it is particularly acute			
in India ?			
 Nahi saheb 			
Dekhye we're confusing two issues 			
 There's the issue of rural health infrastructure and			
rural health needs versus urban health need 			
Though the poor in both areas deserves the same 			
This question has been tackled in our planning 			
 We've done well not enough 			
 We're going to do more 			
 Yeh nai government ki niti hai ke jyada se			
jyada rural areas mein resources banao			
 			
Health to State subject hai aur 			
State ki planning mein minimum needs			
programme mein public health programmes mein 			
jyada se jyada rural infrastructure badate jayen 			
But you see you should not refuse the creation of rural health			
infrastructure 			
But what is has come to be known all			
over the world as the primary health care approach 			
What is the difference ?			
In one case we create infrastructure to reach people			
dispensaries haspatals sub-centre nurse midwife			
doctor 			
But in the case of primary health care approach woh			
kaheta hai ke jyada se jyada jage de 			
Let people get access to medical aid from the			
simplest sources 			
 Kahene ka matlab hai you must be able to get			
eighty-five percent of the normal illnesses treated at the nearest health			
centre			
You don't have to go to a hospital			
Uhm 			
You also don't require a specialist 			
You must understand that there are three issues here 			
One is the issue everybody must take care of his health			
Government can't take care of his health 			
Second is a community by itself can do a lot of self-help 			
It has been done 			
The third is everybody do not be taken care of by a specialist			
Ordinary doctors ordinary para-medicals the health system 			
can render a tremendous amount of care as near as possible 			
Now primary health care approach involves rural in 			
 infrastructure 			
But it is not only rural infrastructure uhm it is a			
philosophy that you can take care of your health 			
Community can have a lot of self-help in health and government			
can supplement by making available health facilities 			
Now one important facility there is health education 			
So people can't take care of the health unless they know what			
to do about it			
 Uhm 			
Right			
 Ek iske saath sambandhit sawal yeh hai ke hum ne aksar			
dekha hai jo hamare doctor hai chikitsak jo hain woh gramin			
shetra mein jakar kam nahi karte infact I think Jee saheb			
 was complaning about this Jee saheb 			
 Deepakji aap bilkul sahi kar rahe hain			
Balke main to yahan tak kahoonga ke Dilli mein bade haspatalon			
mein jo doctor hain agar unme se kisi ki kisi ka tabadla			
Dilli ke kisi gaon mein hojaye to uski ek hi koshish hoti hai ke kis tarah			
mil milakar apna apni transfer jo hai woh shaher mein 			
 karwa le 			
 How how would you tackle this problem ?			
No of course not let me say it is not true 			
First of all I've been on behalf of the doctors well			
I think mind you there can't be any public health programme in this			
country without the leadership and complete involvement of doctors 			
How can that absolutely 			
 Absolutely absolutely 			
The doctor has to be the leader of public health 			
And he must provide the linkages in public health 			
After having said that I would say a very large number of			
rural areas are serviced by doctors 			
Circumstances differ from state to state 			
If you went to a state like Madras or Maharashtra or even			
Bengal a large number of people work in rural areas			
Uhm 			
 Magar sawal yeh hai ye doctor jo hai			
kafi bade acche kisam ki education ke prapt karnewale hain			
No we've the best doctors in the world			
I mean everbody accept that 			
 And they've been trained I think in			
conditions which require certain amount of infrastructure for them to			
function 			
 They've a family to live 			
 They've some kind of education of children and so on 			
Since they're exceptionally gifted uh professionals 			
been given a good course of education there is some reluctance in a			
part of them to go to rural areas 			
A large number of things have been done by government			
We have allowances we've incentives we've			
 created houses quarters and so on as part of the pri			
 primary health infrastructure scheme 			
I think gradually as development increases excess increase of			
his own system increased doctors are in fact available 			
Mind you may I also say this that as against about four			
lakhs of doctors three and a half lakhs doctors of the allopathic system			
 there're about four lakhs of wise render hakims			
 and so on 			
They are already available in the rural areas 			
So it's not as if the rural areas is totally without any			
medical help 			
But allopathic modern system of medicine with a backup of			
dispensaries and drug etcetera is spreading perhaps somewhat			
slowly			
Mr Srinivasan one other question			
This is regarding the availability of medicines 			
 Hum ne dekha hai ke nakli dawayiaan bazaar mein bahut			
bikti hai 			
Now what is the position what you're doing to control			
this ?			
 Saheb you see you know it's 			
very difficult question to answer 			
First of all prescription vary 			
There are cases where nakli dawayiaan asal mein 			
definite asal mei hai if I may say so 			
But bahut si jagah pe what you say is 			
nakli dawayee is in fact dawayee which tested			
by efficacy test does not measure up 			
Tested by bio availability test is not measured up 			
It is not uh totally uh a kind of uh it's it's 			
misleading in it's effect			
It claims more than it does 			
The reason for that is the quality of good manufacturing 			
that have to go into this is improving slowly 			
But again please don't lose the perspective 			
We produce about three thousand crores worth of			
medicine 			
 Two words I think a good part of it comes from large			
industries 			
Good part of it comes from well run small industry 			
I would say that there that medicine is as good as anybody else			
But yeah there are black sheep and the only way to do			
it is to have drug regulatory action 			
Now drug regulatory action has to be within the law 			
So we must have drug inspectors more laboratory facilities 			
What is more important or more acute consumer consciousness			
You mentioned a little while ago that the present emphasis			
 the present priorities on health care in rural areas 			
 What're the new concepts and technologies and this will			
be my last question ?			
Yeah			
But you see technology wise certainly the early			
detection has an approach			
Uhm 			
Take cancer for instance 			
Cancer of the breast cancer of the cervic for women oral			
cancer for men 			
I think it's possible to have lot more of education given			
 to people to school teachers 			
So that they can detect either by the help of a friend or by			
themselves 			
What is it that requires treatment ?			
And it's now clear for instance in cancer if you detect			
early you can get it completely cured 			
Take for instance oral health and dental health 			
As a country we wash a lot 			
Inspite of that our oral health is declining it's 			
possible for us uh to get so technology is going to be not			
tremendously different from what is known but health education 			
involvement of people getting people to look after the health is part			
of the primary health approach would be the main issue			
Mr Secretary will we have health for all by two thousand			
 ?			
 It's very broad question and what do we mean 			
certainly we'll have much creative control over disease some			
diseases definitely 			
 We'll have much creative effective immunization of			
children against preventable diseases 			
We would have I hope much greater positive awareness of health 			
And my own personal feeling is I hope that people would be			
encouraged to take care of their own health and medicine would stand			
 somewhat demystified			
Thank you very much sir for joining us on the morning show			
and sharing with us your views and perspectives about health care in India			
past present and future			
We appreciate your presence			
Thank you very much indeed

He got good education and got well-paid cosy job with the			
Planning Commission 			
But he soon realised that the fruits of planning and development did			
not really reach the needy 			
He was disillusioned 			
His restless soul drove him to the solitary solitude of the			
Himalayas 			
But even the life of sanyasi disillusioned him 			
So he decided to go back to Andhra Pradesh to write a book on the			
tribals 			
But what he saw shocked him 			
He saw woman being yoked instead of oxen 			
Enough was enough he decided 			
He gave up the idea of writing the book and decided to work for			
the welfare of the tribals 			
He became their liberator 			
He is P K S Madhavan 			
 Let's meet him 			
 Let's hear more about him his experience and the			
voluntary organisation he set up from him 			
Mr Madhavan could you tell us about this volantary organisation			
 AWARE which you set up ?			
In nineteen seventy-five when I moved into Andhra Pradesh			
 with the interest of writing a book on tribals 			
I did a small research in one block where about five thousand			
tribals were given about ten million rupees in a			
government programme 			
And once our former Prime Minister was telling only twelve percent			
of the money reached people 			
My research in that particular block I found only two percent			
reached people 			
And ten years we made all efforts to see that these people come up			
But I found that why this is happening ?			
Millions of rupees were put in 			
Why people are not responding ?			
And I discovered people are not part of planning not part			
of implementation not part of evaluation 			
So I thought writing a book is an intellectual exploitation 			
I get my name I get my doctorate but people are not going			
to benefit out of it 			
So I said I'm not going to write a book 			
 I'll create awareness among the people so that they			
will decide their future 			
So with that intention I started this organisation AWARE			
How did you realise that only two percent of the planning and			
development really reached the people ?			
You see when I tracked the money where it has gone I			
found out sixty-two percent has gone to maintain the administration			
bureaucracy and other things 			
And about thirty percent of the money has gone by middle man			
 corruption and commission etcetera 			
Seven percent of this money reached poor people 			
So I felt atleast seven percent reached 			
When I investigated five percent of this money was misused by			
the people themselves 			
So only two percent reached people 			
So this is the fate of our planning and implementation 			
Then what will happen to our country ?			
So I said why this is happening ?			
People must be able to know what they wanted ?			
Where they live ?			
What their future ?			
So people's participation is a fundamental necessity 			
for any development			
How did you make people participate in your ventures ?			
How did you draw out the meek tribals into your work ?			
In the beginning people did not trust me			
Because I'm a new person and I'm talking a			
different language and they did not believe me at all			
In some place there was an opposition 			
People thrown threw stone at me 			
In one village they want wanted to shoot			
at me as with the arrows 			
But persuasion continuous meeting and explaining them and			
motivation has helped me after six months eight months to people to			
understand there is a man who is talking about them and trying to help			
them 			
So that is how I just tempted and also I used telling the			
stories to the children meeting the women talking to the elderly			
people 			
Slowly I became friend of them and they started accepting 			
How do you communicate with the tribals ?			
In the beginning I was talking a a with the			
 help of a interpreter a local man 			
Normally a vested interest their opinion maker 			
Slowly slowly when I was able to observe the their			
problems I started directly talking to them 			
Childrens were first my media 			
When elderly people I used to talk to them 			
Ramayana I used to talk to 			
Mahabharata 			
Some of the stories of tribal culture			
That is how I became friend with them 			
And I never expected anything from them 			
I never asked them to do anything 			
Simply discussing becoming friend 			
So slowly they took me as a friend and then they started			
telling their problems 			
What was your first impression of tribals when you really met			
them in nineteen seventy-five and what is your impression of them now ?			
You see my expe my assessment of this poverty in			
our country is poverty is a conspiracy 			
And always people think by giving money poverty can be removed			
It is not true 			
To remove the poverty what we need is courage psychological			
make up people must prepare themselves 			
And among the tribals they are meek they are afraid of the new			
people they don't understand what exactly happening and they are very			
traditional they are away from the communication 			
And even the small communicators were exploiters 			
So as a result they did not respond to the real development of our			
country			
And what is their state now ?			
Now after fifteen years of my entry and my one			
word work perhaps what I can say is that what we have done is to			
explain to the people what government is doing for them 			
What government infrastructure 			
Infact in the whole of the world our country has got an			
excellent legislation 			
Always in favour of poor 			
Our constitution our legislations always in favour of poor 			
But this has to be translated into action 			
And we have an excellent infrastructure meant for the poor 			
But it has to be implemented 			
So may be the Aware's role is to			
explain to the people to utilise the infrastructure to make use of			
the law for their own social transformation and economic betterment 			
Do you mean to say that the infrastructure that the government			
has created for the welfare of the backwards and the tribals your			
organisation plays a key role into passing the benefits to the 			
tribals and backwards ?			
 Yeah 			
The motivation explanation bringing the people near to the			
government infrastructure asking them to fight for their rights 			
asking them to utilise the existing infrastructure 			
I will give an example there is a rural back in a village			
And uh government has got four percent differential rate of			
interest 			
Nowhere in the world we've got such a infrastructure			
But people goes go to a landlord and			
take money for six and forty percent interest 			
Why institution is there why people are not able to utilise it			
Because people must know that institution is meant for them 			
they have right to utilise that institution 			
I ask these people I organise them to the bank educated			
them 			
Asked the bank to help them and I brought bank and people			
together 			
Landlord or the moneylender disappeared 			
What can be the role of a voluntary organisation vis-a- vis			
the government institutions ?			
See nobody should ever come to a conclusion that voluntary			
organisation is going to replace government			
It is it is meaningless 			
The voluntary organisations are always the forerunners the			
pilots 			
Who can experiment who build innovative programmes 			
We can bring the people and government together 			
So the role of voluntary organisation is a complementary and			
supplimentary efforts of the government welfare programmes 			
That should be the spirit of voluntary organisations 			
Educate the people create awareness ask to utilise			
government infrastructure 			
Ask the government also to understand people 			
So they must be catalyst between the people and government 			
Your organisation Aware in how 			
many states do you operate and how many villages are you covering ?			
 We were work we started our work 			
 in Andhra Pradesh 			
So we are now in covering about two thousand three hundred			
villages in Andra Pradesh 			
About eight hundred villages in the neighbouring			
Orissa			
These are the two uh states where Aware 			
is concentrating 			
But we've got pilot projects in Kerala Tamil Nadu 			
Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh 			
May be shortly next year we may be starting our programme in			
Manipur also 			
But how do you decide that which village needs your			
attention and where do you need to go to help the people ?			
In the present area we're working in a			
particular area 			
So we're expanding literally like this because			
 now Aware is a known organisation			
Hundreds of villages are coming asking us to adopt 			
But we don't work in an area more than eight years 			
We withdraw make people themselves be free and indepenent			
of Aware 			
They have their own future			
They must've their own plan and they should not			
depend upon Aware 			
Once we withdraw from thousand villages we expand to another			
thousand villages 			
Like that we're spreading 			
In a place like Kerala and Tamil Nadu and other places 			
where there are tribals because my organisation is working for			
the tribal welfare and we are also including harijans 			
also harijans and tribals are two communities whom			
with whom we're working 			
So wherever there is such people like in Uttar Pradesh 			
there is a lot of child labour bounded labour 			
 Mirjapur district where we are working 			
Similarly in Vainad in in Kerala where tribals are there			
So wherever the tribals are there where there condition is very			
bad our organisation is trying to set up a project there 			
Which one has been your singular achievement ?			
When were you really touched by the apathy shown towards the			
tribals and which you feel has been your achievement in the last			
fifteen years ?			
In nineteen seventy-five I have seen tribals are 			
yoked to the tribals are tied to the tree and beaten black and blue 			
And no law enforcing agency has two words 			
One thing which I cannot forget is once when I was going 			
I've seen two women yoked like a oxen and made to draw the water			
from the well 			
And I reach landlord and asked them why this is happening ?			
 It's a cultural oppression he didn't had any feeling			
for it 			
He said yes 			
And that among them one is a pregnant woman 			
I thought if it is my mother and it is my sister what would have			
 been happened ?			
If landlord's mother and sister can he yoke like that			
 ?			
So that was a a very disturbing fact in my life 			
Then I said no this cannot continue			
This is our independent India and I what I thought is			
 the poor people loss their dignity they are meek 			
There is a conspiracy to keep them always poor by giving the			
alcohol and other things 			
So now let them discover their dignity 			
Let them feel that they are equal citizens in this country 			
That is where my motivation awareness creation training			
camps mahasabhas all those thinkers made them to realise			
 they are equal citizens of this country 			
Today a tribal fifteen years ago a tribal used to run away			
when he see saw me today he can reach the			
gates of the Chief Minister and knock his door and ask him to hear			
his problems			
 That's the greatest satisfaction for me			
Do you feel a sense of pride when you realise that you have			
been you've been able to give them this kind of sense of			
dignity			
I I do not say pride but I feel so happy so content in my			
life perhaps I would have never achieved anything more than this 			
Today a bonded labour who was beaten in my presence is the			
president of mandal praja parishad what more I 			
wanted want ?			
For two years you led the life of a sanyasi 			
 why did you give that up ?			
See I thought I must find out some meaning in my life 			
I thought spiritualism is one of the main 			
So I became a monk and I was uh with monks 			
I met a number of great people great mahatmas 			
But what I found is they do not have any solution for poverty			
and sufferings of the poor people 			
They have some solutions which for your next life nobody has seen			
it 			
And I also thought many of these people are expression of			
capitalist system 			
The rich peoples agents 			
I said no my precious life should not be wasted in these			
debates			
I must do something action 			
That action must remove the suffering of the people 			
That is what Swami Vivekananda said it 			
Perhaps what Swami Vivekananda did I said I tried to			
translate in action 			
Uh what role what is the role of women when uh uh 			
they are the receiving and when they are trying to get the fruits of			
development ?			
See always in the in the development woman was kept as a			
second rate citizen 			
 It's very unfortunate 			
But I learnt many things from the women themselves in my own			
project area 			
To be very frank in Aware women are the			
 leaders of programme 			
 I'll give one example 			
Always government is giving some money 			
 Aware is also giving some money 			
Banks are giving some money 			
So I spoke to uh a few women I told how long you are going			
to recieve the money can't you create money among yourselves 			
The discussion went on for two hours 			
And they came out with a small programme which was very very			
encouraging 			
They call it as chitanya nidhi's 			
programme 			
Each one of them pay five rupees in a week 			
and fifteen must become one unit 			
And then two hundred and fifty they collect I give two			
fifty			
Out of five hundred rupees four fifty is given to			
one woman as a loan which she pay back next week 			
Like that in thirty seven weeks the so called poor woman			
 could collect one crore forty seven lakhs rupees			
 			
So you can see the poor is only our term 			
Poor is potential and they could keep such a money and			
then it is revolved among them 			
Thirty-seven five hundred women are beneficiary of this programme			
today 			
India is rich in human resources 			
 We've so much of talent amongst ourselves 			
Now having worked for fifteen years what do you think should be			
done so that more and more villages are drawn into this kind of 			
development process			
It is my emotional feeling always India cannot be a			
poor country 			
With eight hundred and twenty million people we must be richest			
people 			
What is happening is the human resource is not planned 			
developed and utilised 			
We are always thinking of the economics money material 			
matter 			
But this so called rich resource we've got has to			
be utilised			
So perhaps my next to ten years work is I'm 			
going to plan in one block or one samiti where all human			
resource will be planned utilised and developed so that that block			
must be self-sufficient 			
So budgeting human resource is one of the important thing			
We must take uh into notice in the our planning 			
If somebody wants to join your voluntary organisation how			
does one do that ?			
Welcome 			
We we always like people			
There are a number of people who support Aware			
 			
Friends of Aware members of Aware			
 			
And we've an ideology like this where through			
awareness development is brought and unless development is a 			
people's movement development has no relevance 			
Or if the development is meant for the people or poor and			
poor must be the captains of the development 			
These are all our expectations 			
In another thing in Aware uh we always			
think this alcohol is a conspiracy to keep the poor people always poor			
What is the full meaning of Aware ?			
 Aware stands for action for welfare and			
awakening in rural environment 			
Do you want to confine yourself only to the rural areas or			
work for the poor in the urban areas as well ?			
For last fifteen years we worked only in rural areas 			
Now we thought it is also necessary to get solidarity of the urban			
poor to support			
You see today our country is passing through a transition 			
 The already for last twenty years ten percent of the			
rural population migrated to the urban areas 			
And urban areas is not our culture 			
Rural civilisation is our culture 			
So in order to prevent urbanisation slums and other problems			
 we want to take care of the people in urban area itself developing			
the rural people			
So next year we may perhaps move into little bit into			
urban area where poor people comes and migrates and struggle for			
their life 			
What is your dream regarding these people what do they 			
you really want them to become ?			
What do you want to see ?			
In my life I would like to see the whole of this caste			
system which is conspiring to the society's underdevelopment			
to be removed 			
Where a tribal a harijan or a 			
brahmin or anybody are equal equally share the responsibility of			
governance of this country 			
And my dream is Mahatma Gandhi's dream a 			
gram swaraj 			
Village that stands on its own leg and its own self-			
sufficiency 			
I believe in Mahatma's per 			
perfect theory of making a village a gram swaraj			
 that was my dream			
Well Mr Madhavan's dream is also that of a 			
gram swaraj the same as Mahatma Gandhi's 			
We wish him all luck in his endeavours 			
Thank you for being with us			
Thank you 			
Mrs Jamuna is a Congress-I member of Parliament representing			
Rajamundri east Godavari of Andhra Pradesh in the Lok Sabha			
 			
This is her first term as a member of parliament 			
But her talent is multifaceted 			
Long before she face the people she was facing life			
 studio life 			
Yes she is a famous film personality of Andhra 			
But she is known beyond Andhra as well 			
Those of us who remember the film Milan 			
 cannot forget her award winning performance as Gauri 			
But apart from occasional stories into the Hindi cinema she			
has largely restricted herself to Telugu cinema 			
Although she has also acted in Tamil and Kannada films as well 			
Jamunajee considering how many films and how films have been			
 making politicians in the south it must have been smooth sailing for			
you isn't it ?			
Yes of course because uh being a cine artist uh			
we use to are more accustomed to public 			
Because uh as a cinema artist we use to go into the masses and			
uh for shooting and for for public meeting as a social workers also			
We have a lot of contact with uh public in cine life 			
So naturally when we have become a uh politician I think			
uh it's not much difficult to uh do our service as 			
one or two word our politician			
When did you actually entered films ?			
I was so young I think uh nineteen fifty-two I was			
just fourteen years may be 			
So I entered into the film fray as a heroine in the first			
picture itself 			
One one word uh			
 One word I'm sorry 			
Uh my first picture was the name 			
Foottillu that means in Hindi you can say 			
Maike 			
In nineteen fifty-two one Mr uh late Raja Rao he			
introduced me to the film 			
He hails from uh Rajamundri constituency which I'm 			
 now presenting as a public servant 			
So he introduced me to the film as a heroine first 			
We know that you have for thirty years played a			
leading role in cinema 			
Especially that you have always played a leading actress 			
How many Hindi films have you made ?			
So far I have acted uh nearly twenty twenty films 			
in Hindi 			
My first Hindi film was uh Naya Aadmi			
 and that was superhit film in those days 			
And then second picture Miss Mary			
 			
Third was uh Humrahi 			
Fourth Milan 			
Fifth Rishte-nate Beti-bete 			
 and then Dulhan uh			
so many films			
And Rajtilak recently I			
acted with uh Sanjeev Kumar in Yadgar 			
 and uh Naukar Bibi ka 			
Like that so many films I acted 			
Yeah the song that was picturised on you bol gori bol			
tera kaun piya that was a very famous song			
 Laughs Yes of course 			
That was uh Milan picture 			
I received a filmfare award from for 			
 Milan best actress award in those			
days 			
I think I'm the first South Indian star to receive a			
filmfare award as a best actress in Milan 			
 			
Now that you've become a member of parliament is			
it true that people are now wanting to see more of your old films 			
Yes especially uh become MP all our MP's 			
collegues are uh very much interested to see my films old films			
They are asking me uh Jamunajee kahan milte hai apke			
 films apto bahot purani kalakar hai 			
How can we get your Hamarahi Milan 			
 ?			
I said I will try to bring some old films for you			
I will give it as a presentation to everybody 			
I was trying to get hold of my old films 			
 One or two words you know that old films are very precious			
to get			
Yeah 			
We also know that you have been active on theatre front 			
Uh you're also the president of the Andhra Pradesh			
professional theatre group 			
What are your activities there ?			
You see as a artist also I acted more than two hundred			
films 			
We have acted such a wonderful characters unforgetable			
roles 			
Uh even as a old lady uh and then uh sufferring lady			
just like Mother India 			
I did Mother India character in Telugu version			
which Nargis did in Hindi version 			
So it's a very beautiful motherly character 			
So such a types of characters I acted 			
And then after that I thought of to 			
 do some uh work for uplift of these old indigent 			
theatre artist 			
Because cinema is uh fundamentally we should act in uh			
dramas only			
From dramas only we have become a very famous actors in films you			
see 			
So one should not forget theatre at all 			
We came from theatre			
We hail from theatre 			
We have learnt acting on theatre 			
So I want to do service to theatre artist I become a uh			
president of AP Professional Artist Theatre Federation 			
It is uh uhm state level body 			
 I have we have got more than ten			
thousand members all over the state Andhra Pradesh 			
And the president for that for the last fifteen years while			
acting also I was so busy as a artist even then I used to uh give lot			
of service to the especially this old indigent artist giving			
pensions and then getting house one word for them 			
And uh to improve their art to use to give a lot of			
encouragement 			
Still I am continuing as a president of Professional Artist Theatre			
Federation 			
 I'm returning to the subject of films 			
Why did you discontinued uh your film career 			
yeah 			
 Film career 			
 Laughs 			
Naturally after uh becoming a politician I want to			
give full uh justice to my uh profession 			
I I don't like to put one leg this side one leg in film			
field and one leg in politician as a politician 			
I think we can't do any justice to our performance			
So I want to give up my film career due to uh po			
 politics 			
But your family compulsion as well 			
No not much 			
Because my husband is a very co-operative man 			
And then sm smoothly going			
my family life also 			
I have married to my uh my husband is a Professor			
of Zoology at Osmania University 			
I got uh one son and daughter 			
So life is going smoothly 			
They must also be very fond of your old films I am sure			
 Laughs 			
There is one question about film I wanted to ask you 			
Do your fans feel still as the screen image that they have of			
you ?			
Or do they know that you only act perform roles ?			
How do they react to you when they see you in person ?			
Naturally they are uh very much excited to see as a person			
Because uh being a veteran artist for thirty years uh uhm			
for example I can say at my Rajmundari constituency I used to go to to			
very rural places 			
So there they were just like uh they are worshipping as			
a goddess 			
So after seeing me naturally they will get lot of uh			
excitement			
Some people especially uh lady character 			
I have got lady fans more than uh gents I think so 			
So they used to embrace me and kiss me			
They said oh Jamunajee we never thought we'll see you			
 uh like this 			
So we are very happy we'll vote for you and then you			
must do good work for those our uh you should solve our problems			
I said I had given a promise 			
So that excitement will be will be there 			
Not on uh			
Cinema has been contributing uh to very large extent 			
in the south especially it has been throwing up some very interesting 			
uh politicians 			
Why do you think more and more politicians in the south take to			
 uh sorry more and more film personalities in south take to politics ?			
I think as a citizen of India every citizen has			
 a right to become a politician 			
Politician means not only a uhm getting some money or getting			
fame 			
We can do service to the public 			
As a democratic country we have got uh every right to every			
man and the woman and every citizen of India they got a right to enter			
into the politics there is no restrictions for that 			
But does their screen image really help them ?			
Sometimes in this that is image is there 			
that glamour will add our political 			
 In this 			
Does it make your canvassing easier ?			
Not easier 			
Just like other a few words canvass because now-a-days			
 uh uh political situation and especially rural masses also there			
public has uh got uh political awareness 			
Now they are not uh so easily there now we can't attract			
them with glamour all those things 			
The glamour will be there but one should not work one word			
 very hardly then only we will win 			
Otherwise not possible			
In this modern world where we have television we have news			
magazines where they keep telling us that an actor the role			
that he performs is just a role he is in fact a simple man like us			
There are still these images that people have 			
How do they maintain how does a man maintain his image ?			
The film ?			
Yes 			
You see the film uh maintaining the image one			
should have certain principles in personal life also 			
And then he should uh take good characters representing			
 some social problems economic problems with a rural character			
representing poor family's character 			
Then if uh act uh if he acts like this he can maintain his uh			
good image in film field also long long standing image like me I			
had so many variety characters 			
What kind of screen image did you have ?			
I had uh very good image otherwise I think I should not			
say myself it shows uh little bit embarassment 			
Even then I have to say to public that I am I think I am the			
first lady to act in two hundred not two hundred films as a heroine			
 thirty years as a leading lady of south Indian screen I can say			
So like that I got that image in public			
How many of your films have won awards ?			
Out of two hundreds may be nearly hundred films state			
awards and then national awards 			
While national awards one word to come to Delhi very			
often 			
And Mrs Gandhi was there Information and Broadcasting minister			
 a few words 			
And then state awards for so many films 			
Which is the highest award that you have got ?			
I think in Hindi film Milan 			
 is uh highest filmfare filmfare award is there for me 			
And of course in Andhra Pradesh if we state awards and best			
actress award in Telugu films I am the first lady continously nine			
times I have been elected as a best actress award 			
Welcome to the studio and thank you for being with us 			
First of all when we talk about parallel processing and			
super-computers what are these things ?			
Super-computers really the amount of data number it			
contains 			
The good old days about thirty years ago big two garages will			
contain things with small capability now it comes it control			
about ten crore of operations			
Ten crores the hundred mega flops you see 			
in one second that's type of that is super computing			
Why do we need it in India ?			
We require it for weather modelling pollution monitering			
 variety of things			
Where ever you need too fast too big these things if you			
want to look at you have to now crunch the numbers very fast 			
Do it and then see what it means 			
It has a lot of uh uses in these			
 Lekin super computer ko banane mei			
kharcha bahut hota hai Rajan saheb 			
Is this expenditure justified ?			
 Jyada nahi haan			
Yeh jo sidhaant mei jo development hoti hai uski			
 thirty-six crore ki cheez hai aur uska jo usse			
 benefit jo hota hai ke agriculture model			
 ho water modelling ho seismic			
modelling ho aur reactor ki safety			
 ho dam ki safety ho 			
So itne hain ke woh fed-up ho jayega 			
Iske upar bahut sare uh computer software se			
karne hai woh itne hojayenge ke pura society mei hona			
chahiye 			
Abhi kuch das saal ke uh agle Jee saheb ke liye bahut sare			
 robot bhi ho sakte hain jo translate 			
karenge laughter hopefully so knowledge ko itni			
tarakki jo data process karne uhm 			
the computer parallel process ki bauchhar hogi 			
 Uhm 			
We we don't want him to be replaced by			
Oh no no no not remove him not him			
 Jee saheb has to 			
 Jee saheb to bahut sare ka use 			
karenge accha aur thoda haan tum karo abhi			
yeh Tamil mei baat karo nahi to doosre mei baat karo			
Woh kar sakte hain			
Woh to future generation			
 Accha 			
And you know since we you know Jee saheb 			
and I are a bit ignorant about technical terms 			
 Yeh parallel processing would you like to explain			
in in simple uh terms 			
 Okay 			
The computer for past thirty years has been doing do one uh			
competition put it in a memory do one competition put it in a memory			
It does it very fast but that has a limit 			
When we are thinking in terms of tons and crore 			
 that is hundred million two hundred million five hundred million type of			
operations per second then this slows down the process			
So you do it in a different multiple persons many			
brains using in harmony 			
So actually some computer people say tyranny of the central			
memory will be gone 			
Many many places they all do it in parallel 			
So you can handle large amount of data			
That is parallel processing 			
It is essential to advance super computer in later stage			
Mr Rajan you're closely involved in monitoring the			
development of uh this technology in India			
How far away is India from its own super computer ?			
Not very far 			
These works which are taking place in C dot C tac then			
there are the number of parallel processing of course in N A L Indian			
Institute of Science D R D O BARC C M C L they are all doing very			
well 			
I would not like to see in terms of number of years of first and			
second two or three 			
But in terms of one using the software for various uses			
weather forcasting modelling etcetera 			
As well as for these 			
They are quite in contemporary to the needs of our			
country we should be able to meet most of it in the coming years			
How far developed how developed is India's			
 technology in this field compare to other countries ?			
Contemporary I would say not more than in fact this			
technology is itself only four five years or seven eight years old 			
So we are very close to those things			
Some of it's developments 			
And once we've the super computers how will you			
 Mr Rajan use it ?			
Oh there are number of possibilities say my job is technology			
forecasting 			
There are so many things which can be done whether it is pollution			
monitering even heart stimulation 			
Do anything which you want to look at before designing a car			
 before designing an aircraft you want to see 			
Do the design there let it crash and see 			
So you can one word build a dam you want to look at			
safety anything can be done in the computer without spending any			
money 			
Then you look at it then you perfect the design 			
Many of these things though I myself would not be uh using			
it in that form 			
There are many hundreds of young men and women in the country 			
who will use it and then they will export even the software 			
Mr Rajan one last question 			
Gaze into your crystal bowl after the super computer in India			
 what next ?			
Artificial inte intelligence 			
 fifth generation computer 			
 That's what I meant Jee saheb he can			
have hundreds of them 			
How many other that's right			
 You're obviously excited about the developments			
taking place 			
Thank you 			
And we certainly have shared the excitement Jee saheb			
jinhone bataya super computer ke bare mein 			
 Haan Deepakji bas mei itna chahata hoon ke 			
science technology super computer ka labh hum tak hum aam			
logon tak chhoti tabiyat ke logon tak jald se jald pahoonch jaye			
 Yehi Rajan saheb aap ko bata rahe the 			
Our guest this morning was Mr Y S Rajan adviser in Department			
of Science and Technology 			
 We've been talking to him about the exciting break			
through in the field of parallel processing and super computer development in			
India 			
Newly elected A I A D M K member of parliament from			
Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu Mr Shekhar is an advocate by profession and 			
he's a party's district secretary 			
Mr Shekhar welcome to our studio 			
Thank you 			
Tell us Mr Shekhar ah how do you 			
attribute the right of regional po parties 			
 in India's body politics 			
 Ah 			
You see in India there is uh plenty of languages 			
and uh plenty of uh re regional 			
 I just like that 			
Even though in this uh type of uh our nation because we			
 are having many differences and many communal individual parties			
We refuse to save integration and to our India 			
Then this is you see many peoples are there peoples living or			
having many languages and uh many cultures like that 			
This way the only regional parties which are reflecting the			
 regional peoples culture and their uh uh cultures and their 			
views through that regional parties only gain 			
And so the regional party is having just a close relationship which			
is basically with that uh people the regional peoples 			
You know now-a-days you see that only the Congress have 			
such much of approach to the uh uh throughout			
national vein 			
No other party is rather having that much of approach 			
Anyhow our A I A D M K Anna D M K which is led by our 			
puratchithalaivi Ms Jayalalitha or Madam 			
Uh is having the party in uh yes and many states in Andhra			
 Karnataka in Pondicherry as well as now in uh our capital			
New Delhi itself 			
So that not only the regional parties are developing in other			
states our other regions 			
Uh they're also having the confidence of the regional 			
 pe peoples that uh they're 			
reflecting that uh views and angles 			
So only the regional parties can built the uh views and the			
imagines or anything you've to take of the			
peoples opinion 			
Uh so uh the regional parties are in our country just like			
our country democratical country we're giving the freedoms			
to regional parties in one way			
 In From another angle the regional			
parties are uh uhm uh united itself and give a democratical set-up to our			
nation			
But do you think that regional parties have the same vision			
 as the national party ?			
Certainly because they're having the same			
interest of uh uh national uh national parties interest 			
You know that our M G R our beloved leader in the time of war			
war time of China he donated he's the first it was the 			
man who donated such a huge amount just like a thing it was more than a			
 lakh uh to our late Prime Minister Pandit			
 Jawaharlal Nehru 			
He donated a huge amount			
Nobody under at that time nobody 			
donated such amount 			
 Whereas he was in the regional party under this he			
donated uh too much of high amount to our Prime Minister for integration			
But do you think that the regional party is they you know			
integrate the federal structure			
Certainly because regional party is having the same view			
on one word there			
Reflecting there mo their culture their mother tongue			
such like that but they want integration of the India 			
 They've definitely work for it they've definitely			
 uh stood in front for their integration of the country our nation 			
But do you think that the rise of regional parties is a			
temporary phenomenon or it is a permanent feature of our politics			
 It's permanent uh feature			
Because nobody can uh uh divert our divert the 			
regional culture or regional languages you see 			
So uh this is because this is biggest uh our nation 			
have many languages and many regions 			
So this is the permanent one			
Nobody can uh uh that's why nobody can uh close			
this angle 			
This is the only thing only angle the permanent unity 			
because whenever the regional parties have developed 			
Then uh the national development no doubt at all 			
Mr Shekhar you were I believe totally associated with the late			
M G R who was a very charismatic leader			
Yeah			
Tell us something more about him			
M G R is uh uncomparable leader 			
He has fight fought for the poor people			
and down downtrodden peoples 			
Uh in not only his cine his film not only come through cine 			
cine or such one word yes because he was a big donor 			
Uh uh even though he was asked this he donated uh uh a huge			
amount by his hard work 			
Whatever he earned he donated all the money to the people			
And after his death he donated the uh his wealth			
to his people			
Now-a-days it is said he donated his house and uh our			
properties to the poor peoples 			
Just when you see and that uh our Madam our Puratchi			
 Jayalalitha uhm is true follower or the true leader after M G R			
How is she carrying on the legacy of M G R 			
Yes uh even those in the life life of M G R M G R chose			
 that only Ms Jayalalitha she'll give the she'll 			
be the future uh in your leader 			
He uh put to our Madam in our propoganda secretary at a			
propoganda secretary 			
After M G R she's the true heir to M G R uh uh to			
the party and had a beloved leader 			
She placed uh now she's the only biggest leader 			
from Tamil Nadu 			
Uh 			
But how is she ?			
I mean how's she carrying on what M G R had done ?			
In all political policies and political activities uh			
see even though in M G R's life there is uh like this you see 			
she was trained and she she was has come			
through only by M G R			
And M G R choose she'll be the successor for the party			
And now uh uh that he is going has gone 			
 she is doing you see all problems of uh by-elections and all other			
things 			
She is always with the poor people just like M G R			
 She's fighting for the poor people for downtrodden people			
 uh as in by election manifesto she has declared all things to the favour			
and one word but without any other parties uhm see in the			
election manifesto she gave one word sort of manifesto			
It is prepared only for the poor people			
I can see that you've pinned photograph of Ms			
Jayalalitha yes any particular reason for that ?			
 Yes 			
Yes she is our lea she is the only leader after M G R			
 right 			
She is a true follower right 			
 We're proud of having her as our leader			
 Right 			
 Right 			
Uhm 			
Uhn she's fighting for uh not only the poor			
people but also the women women's also			
 She's the only leader women leader 			
Uh she's actually she's uh such a brilliant			
such a uh I want to mention that she is a brilliant and uh			
 she is very capable to do power to the poor and welfare to the			
poor uhm uhm just like M G R			
 Yeah 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Tell us Mr Shekharan something you attempt 			
 You've been naturally involved in students politics also			
 yes yes 			
Uh do you think there has been a criminalisation of students			
politics in the country over the years ?			
 Yes yes 			
No no no 			
Student activities not a criminal in politics not a criminal			
activity because in studies this you know uh in student			
activities in our dravidian movement uh in Tamil Nadu like our			
Annavar Periyar just like M G R all are in the dravidian movement			
That trains the students not only in political activities 			
they must be after aw awareness of the			
political that is our uh political situation in Tamil Nadu			
Or as well as in India international 			
Uh to save their culture and their uh language itself 			
So it's a necessary training in political life 			
that's all yes not a criminalisation			
 Yes 			
Right 			
Uh what is the specific problem in your constituency in Dharmapuri			
 ?			
Dharmapuri you know is in now a days the Cauvery water dispute			
is the major problem 			
Our Madam also recommended our base 			
There is our recommended facts to send it to a tribunal 			
Uh now it's a promise going that way 			
Assuming that this problem is solved amicably how will it			
affect your constituency and Tamil Nadu as a whole ?			
I I want to solve this for all welfare of all states			
Now Karnataka Maharashtra Pondicherry benifitted			
But the Tamil Nadu people those uh are are utilised its water			
Majority uh must have their proper right because it's 			
a long day to have a fight with even uh not a fight yeah 			
there is what if you want to store this 			
You obstruct and everybody sharing the water 			
Our Madam is also uh a very very interested in now a days			
 ke uh she also have a report about this 			
 We're expecting the tribunal judgement that's			
 all 			
 You know I want government about the parliamentary			
constituency they want you please kindly follow yes that			
Cauvery is well actually they gained a gateway only through my			
parliamentary constituency			
 A few words 			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
 That is end of this			
But even in my parliamentary constituency even though Cauvery			
enters we never got a drop of water for drinking facilities or irrigation			
facilities 			
Just as it enters and go to some other areas			
But there're there is an hydel project where they			
must uh our M G R and Devrajan the chief Minister of Karnataka have			
discussed about putting a hydel project in one word a very big			
tourist centre 			
Uh if that will happened happen 			
there'll be in future definitely the power will uh will be			
placed for all states is a major project			
Right			
And another development major master project of drinking			
water problem			
 That's a it was a it is having the well the aided 			
 It was the stone was laided laid			
 by our M G R that M G R there is a pro 			
 project is there master project for one word drinking			
water project 			
If it will happen then the our people in the drought area backward			
area they'll fully fully satisfied with this project			
 With this project 			
Mr Shekhar what are your very shortly your views on			
centre state relationship ?			
Uh state centre relation regarding this uh the state and			
centre relations we our our you see our late M G R has told about the			
state and centre relationship 			
Uh state and centre should have equal powers and uh equal 			
one word 			
Our Madam puratchia Jayalalitha also about that			
is also following that states relations			
 That's all we wanted			
 You're in opposition in both your home state as			
well as in national politics			
How do you reconcile it as a truth			
We don't worry about in opposition or ruling 			
 We're always A I D M K led by our puratchia			
 Jayalalitha is fighting for the poor people 			
It don't bother whether we're in uh opposition or			
ruling			
 We're fighting for the poor people 			
 We're uh reflecting or we're uh uhm			
showing the poor people's view and angles to the ruling party			
whether in a state or centre 			
 That's all			
One last final question Mr Shekhar you're an			
advocate yes by profession yes 			
So how do you reconcile your role as an advocate and a politician ?			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
Yes from the beginning as a student we've say I was			
in uh politicians 			
Uh not yet fully in involved in politics that is			
professional made professional 			
In this way I was in the political activity

advocate profession because it's a high profession

beautiful home here in Kohima 			
I have been looking forward to it for a very long time

Uh after retirement I was settled down I settled

as ambassador of India to Panama and a few words to Costa			
Rica and Nicaragua 			
 Uhm uhm 			
How were our relations then uh with these countries			
 and what was uh publics reaction there vis a vis India ?			
When when I was in there the people in Panama were			
 very friendly ah ha and uh they actually always			
remember Nehru Gandhi yes and Mrs Gandhi 			
And they had they had great respect for our leaders and			
also Ravindranath Tagore they always remembered him uhm uhm			
And also uh as per the political relations they were			
always supporting us in the United Nations also usually			
 Ah ha 			
 Yes 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Do uh uhm did you feel that uh uh enough or at			
least some people from Panama Costa Rica etcetera are also uh			
visiting India as tourists or were they uh uh were they keen to acquire			
 knowledge or information about India our country our culture ?			
Yes actually after my uh turn there as ambassador			
 Panama also sent a woman ambassador to India 			
 Also during my time there was some uh uh there			
were two ladies they were sent to India in this uh to be trained in			
the institute of tute of mass communication			
 One word 			
I see I see 			
Also I was enjoying my time 			
Uh is it uh uh correct presumption that you were the			
first uh person from Naga to have served in the Indian Foreign			
Service ?			
And to have been an ambassador representing our country ?			
Yes in uh in Nagaland uh as far as Naga			
 Nagaland is concerned I was the first one uh			
still I am the first one from the Nagaland to join the Indian Foreign			
Service			
And how many years did you serve there ?			
I think about twenty years			
Oh then do you believe now that your years in the Foreign			
Service have been rewarding for you ?			
Well it was very interesting wherever I went I made			
friends and specially for india 			
And only that uh when I had gone to Brussels ah ha			
 eh uh Rome and Washington D C and Shri Lanka 			
 Ah ha 			
I believe Miss Haralu that uh your board has a varied			
activities 			
Uh we would like to hear from you about some of your			
activities projects initiatives in different areas 			
You see we have a welfare extension projects 			
And this projects have this projects have five centres			
And you know in Nagaland we've seven districts 			
And in six districts we have got these projects centres and			
these are in border areas of Nagaland state			
And for these areas you know because it has rural and remote areas			
 so in in those centres we have a maternity and child welfare centres			
we have put up 			
And in these centres we have a dai and a			
 gramsevika and one word instructor 			
What are the activities you are engaged on these days			
 ?			
Uh we are mainly implementing the schemes of the centre			
 central social welfare board			
And these are uh social uh social social economic			
programme 			
There are for uh in that programme we extend uh financial			
assistance to the some registered societies for piggery which is very			
popular and weaving and knitting and dairy 			
And uh we've other programmes like holiday home camps for			
children for the tribal from the age of nine to fourteen years			
And this is very also very popular 			
Usually these are conducted in winter and uh the children			
are encouraged in this uh in this those are mainly for four children or			
four people you know			
And then uh the purpose is to give them a chance to uh see			
places and also conducting the camps for that to uh to develop 			
leadership training like that 			
And then uh we've one word course for those			
women 			
This mainly for the women who are the dropped 			
drop outs uh from schools			
Then we give them stipend for years year course or two			
years course			
Then we have vocational training for women for uh one or			
two word of women and this is for to train them in tailoring uh			
knitting or even typing and other vocational training so that they will be			
able to get a self self-employment or a get some employment also			
Now tell me uh something about uh uhm the status of			
women in uh Nagaland uh particularly uh vis a vis men and your			
interface with society 			
And do do you think that uh the Naga women have progressed a			
lot ?			
And what are your hopes for the future ?			
I think the when you uh think of in term of the			
literacy rate the female literacy rate is very high 			
Uh I think one of the highest one of the highest in think			
in india also			
And in Nagaland the women are given the girls are given			
equal opportunity uh equal appoi appointment			
 employment and also few of girls have almost reached it if			
I consider top			
Uh we have a couple of IAS officers 			
And also in addition uh uh all the departments we have			
directors like that			
But still our rural women are in majority and I must say			
that I am glad to say that this panchayat teer rajasthani			
 and I think that they were </-. give a a real opportunity			
to women because a women has two things we have not still			
achieved that is inheritance and then women have no place in the 			
 municipality or in the Assembly 			
So I think that the panchayati raj will give			
them a opportunity to come up in that			
Because the deci decision 			
making is they are not they are not involved in that and I think that			
 to have a society uh uh a progressive society or developed			
society we need a participation of cipation of the women also 			
Uh what is your day like ?			
Would you like to tell us 			
Well first of all to tell you honestly I do begin			
with a two cups of tea 			
And then I start going to the garden because I love gardening 			
Then gardening uh most of one word is done in the			
morning after tea			
And then uh I come in and may be I watch TV uh the the			
news 			
And after that may be sometime I cook 			
Then I rush to get ready to go to the office 			
And I go to the central welfare board 			
I mean our our office uh in the town 			
Then the whole day I'm there 			
But most of the time I also travel uh to all the districts 			
Then in the evening of course no one in the evening I come			
back and I read			
Or sometime may be I watch uh TV and sometime I read Holmes			
And then in evening I watch one word after the			
news I go to bed			
Uh Miss Haralu do you mind if I ask a personal question			
Uh I was wondering how come an attractive like 			
lady like you is still single 			
Uh thank you 			
But you know I'm always uh very interested in career			
And I wanted to do so many things and I still want to do so			
many things			
So I had no time to laugh 			
Good morning 			
Professor Savitri Laxmanan is a Congress-I member of parliament			
representing Mukundapuram of Kerala in the Lok Sabha 			
This is her first term as a member of parliament 			
Her entry to into politics have			
 has been fairly recent 			
Infact she joined politics less than three years ago 			
Professor Laxmanan is basically a teacher by profession and			
continues to be so 			
She is professor and head of department of Malyalam 			
 at the St Joseph's college at Eranjilakuda in Mukundapuram 			
She is also an accomplished playwright and a dramatist 			
She has written two books			
One of which is a collection of One Act Plays 			
Professor Laxmanan has also been associated with All			
India Radio for almost sixteen years now 			
Professor Laxmanan can you describe Mukundapuram to us your			
constituency 			
Why not Mr Hemant 			
Mukundapuram is a place so nice 			
It may attract so many people 			
Uh I think it's outside appearance is uh extra			
beautiful in all senses 			
There is uhm one place called one word 			
Which can be converted into a best tourist centre 			
 One word includes my constituency 			
And and there is another place called Malaytoor and			
 Malaytoor attracts so many pilgrims 			
And one Irykod near the famous Kudvillur devi			
 temple 			
Uh and it is supposed that St Thomas came first to this place			
 in India 			
He landed at Irykod says so the history 			
And Irykod is very near to that devi 			
temple Kudvillur			
And uh Kudvillur devi is supposed to came from			
that Kannagi 			
 You've heard the story of Kannagi ?			
Not really ?			
Uh Kannagi also is related to south India 			
That may be the reason you've not heard or to 			
She is a powerful goddess			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh about my own place in Srinelkuda there is a famous			
temple Kudmadikum Shree Kudmadikum temple 			
In which Lord Bharda is the deity and Lord Bharda uh			
 and no other places in India there is Lord Bharda 			
Only at Yetinedkuda people says so 			
But beyond all this Mukundapuram is very poor and in			
 it's living uh people are very poor there 			
Uh or probably too old or to meet the both ends meet 			
Uh so many are labourers and they find it very difficult			
to earn their livelihood 			
But they are trying somehow or other and they expect me to			
help them 			
And uh though even though it is very beautiful with lakes			
rivers paddy fields trees etcetra etcetra we've to uh			
supply some food to them 			
 That's right			
You were saying before uh we to me			
here that there is no such place as Mukundapuram on the map			
Is it true ?			
Uh there's is a small village it is it is			
known as Mukundapuram but uh no notable place in this mean			
Mukundapuram			
Uhm uhm			
But constituency is named liked that Mukundapuram 			
Uh it is connected uh with an old story that Lord Mukunda 			
this Vishnu had great place in some good old days			
 uhm uhm and the place is named after Lord Mukunda 			
Mukundapuram puram means town			
Town of Mukunda			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
In your five year term here uhm what you really			
plan to do for your constituency ?			
 Uhm 			
I want to do a lot for my people 			
But I don't know whether all my hopes will be fulfilled or			
not 			
And I know very well that uh all the needs of the people			
can not be fulfilled by my by me alone 			
But I want to do something for the ordinary people 			
By helping in some way or other 			
 I'll do my best to			
 One or two words 			
Uhm uhm 			
The teaching community and also that of students they must also			
be looking forward to you to help from you of many kinds 			
Then I'll help and allow them 			
What can you do for them as as an M P ?			
 And 			
To my all students I think uh I lost my students 			
This is the only grief I have now 			
I lost the good field of teaching			
Uhm uhm 			
It was so nice in my college with my students and my			
colleague 			
But I do I love one word 			
Do you uh want to go back to teaching full time ?			
 That's a que a very difficult question to			
answer			
I don't know exactly 			
Uh people in my party ask me you you are not contesting this			
election 			
 That's why I came into politics			
And uh truly speaking I love all the topics in between			
sky and earth 			
And I love politics too 			
And I take it as a challenge 			
And for the first time I was facing an election 			
Fortunately or unfortunately I won 			
And now uh I take my constituency as my institution to			
which I'm so fond of 			
I think uhm now Mukundapuram constituency is my St Joseph			
College 			
One thing uh now that you've become member of			
parliament uhm has the attitude of your students or that			
of your collegues changed towards you ?			
 Uhm 			
Uhm I think no 			
Do they notice a change in you ?			
I don't know 			
Uh I want to be with them uh in the what I want to say 			
 I'm the old Savitri Laxmanan among them			
 I see 			
Certainly 			
And I'm sure that they'll consider me as			
their old Savitri Laxmanan			
Uhm uhm 			
 You've written two books			
One of which is the collection of short one act plays 			
uhm 			
Tell us a little more about these books that you've 			
written 			
 Uhm 			
Uh act one of it uh one of them is a collection of short			
stories uh sorry exclusively one act plays uhm uhm 			
And other is full fledged drama			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm uhm 			
Uh and uh drama is published by National Book			
Store 			
Uhm uhm 			
 It's a reputed firm in Kerala			
Uhm uhm 			
It is published some fifteen or sixteen years back 			
And I got some prizes for the script uhm uhm 			
from Kerala Sangeet Natak Academy 			
 uhm um and it is broadcasted through All India Radio			
 to one word is one from Trivandrum			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Uhm uhm			
And I took the female part uhm in my own			
drama 			
 Uhm 			
I think it's a rare oppurtunity for a woman			
artist 			
 I'm sure it must be 			
How long has been your association with All India Radio			
 ?			
Uh I too may for the past fifteen or sixteen years			
I was participating in radio plays			
Uhm uhm 			
 I'm approved as a staff artist there in 			
All India Radio Trichur 			
They used to take			
I used to participate in some of the plays			
Uhm uhm 			
 You've also done discussions for them			
 Haan some discussions some talks 			
 uhm uhm some speeches etcetera 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 You're a teacher by profession 			
One thing I would like to definitely ask you is about your 			
opinion on the education policy			
Do you think there should be a uniform education policy for the			
whole nation ?			
What I know of course Mr Hemant the education must be			
uniform 			
But it it's not practical I think 			
Why do you think so ?			
There are so many who seek higher education 			
But I think ours is a poor country 			
For that uh we're unable to fulfill the hopes of the			
 rising students 			
So private schools must be encouraged in my opinion			
Uhm uhm 			
I say so because in my state there are some who says			
that all must be uhm government oriented education 			
Private school must be abolished from the field 			
But I don't think so			
Because in our state private school and private colleges are			
doing a lot for the students			
 They're not making second rate citizens sort			
But that uh when that is some round about now a days our			
school rise people say these schools are creating second rate			
citizens 			
I feel that is what I think			
Do you also think the medium of instruction ah			
 should be uniform or that uh the three tier system that now exist			
 is all right ?			
 Ah 			
Uhm we've to give due importance to the both			
language English one or two word 			
In my case too I bid farewell to this uh international			
language from one word back because I'm a professor of			
my original language Malyalam 			
And I used to talk and write always in Malyalam and			
now I almost forgot English			
But when I became an M P English is the only force through			
which I can communicate my ideas uhm 			
So also with the other M P's 			
 Uhm 			
Some of them knew very well Hindi because Hindi is their			
mother tongue 			
But they are unaware of the fact that happens in in the south			
The sole reason is that they are not uh uh trying to 			
learn or write this English			
So English could be the link language in my opinion			
And then Hindi our national language 			
That must be also given due importance 			
And I'm trying to learn Hindi 			
Now uh you are also based in Delhi uhm 			
and when the ses when the parliament is in session you've 			
to be hear ah 			
How how difficult or how easy is it for you to communicate here			
 ?			
When you are here			
 Uhm 			
 Ah 			
I always depend upon my little English 			
Are you also comfortable 			
 And I uh I've said I'm 			
trying to learn Hindi 			
Have you started 			
 I've a servant who only spoke 			
Hindi			
Uhm uhm 			
And uh I too learn uh thoda thoda 			
Hindi from her			
 That's very nice uhm 			
 I'm sure she will be 			
 Uhm 			
 I know uh from this kuch nahi malum to			
kya to kya that's all			
 I'm sure one day 			
And I uh bought my uhm little daughters book			
She is doing studying in fifth standard 			
And in my state fifth standard onwards Hindi starts 			
And I bought her books and I read and write 			
Uh yeh kalam hai yeh kitab hai laughs 			
 That's very nice 			
Now you've spoken of your daughter 			
It must be uh a fairly uh tough task for you to manage			
your school college your family and now this uh new thing of being a			
member of parliament 			
How do you manage it ?			
 It's I can't extend very difficult for			
me to part with my family 			
Uhm but I've to 			
During uh Lok Sabha sessions is going on 			
 I'll be here at Delhi and I'll be back at my			
constituency whenever I I'm needed there 			
And of course if there is no meeting is going on here			
at Delhi I can be at Srinelkuda back with my people and with my			
family			
And somehow or other they're managing 			
They rise upto the moment I think uh			
I am sure 			
My husband will look after all such things in my			
absence I think			
 That's very nice 			
 I'm sure you consider the entire student and teaching			
community as one family 			
As a family that uh is really closely knit 			
 I'm very glad that you could come here and share some			
experiences with us 			
Thank you very much for being with us			
Thank you Mr Hemant 			
Today we've Prof H K Das in the studios 			
And we will uh enter into discussion with Prof H K Das on			
various aspects of uh modern research which is going on in the Biology			
Prof Das is Director of Genetic Engineering Unit in			
Jawaharlal Nehru University 			
And currently he is the chairman of uh Centre for			
Biotechnology in the same university that is Jawaharlal Nehru University			
Prof Das I would like to ask you what is uh the			
background or the history of Genetic Engineering Research in India			
 ?			
Yes uh bb I think it will be interesting to trace back the			
history 			
Uhm you see somewhere around nineteen eighty-two uh Prof			
M G K Menon had called some of the Biologists of the country 			
uh for a meeting at Baroda 			
Trying to discuss as to what are the areas that should			
receive thrust for research in India 			
And that's where uh people like us uh had emphasised			
 that uh we are running out of time and we should initiate genetic			
engineering research in India			
You see prior to that uh the science administrators had			
always felt that genetic engineering is too sophisticated and uh it			
cannot be done in India 			
It can be done only in the highly developed countries 			
But we we could convince Prof Menon that there is nothing 			
nothing so sophisticated in genetic engineering or recombinant in technology			
 and it can very well be done uh in our country			
Uh and he didn't take long to understand the point 			
And uh it was decided that the Department of Science and			
Technology uh should start some core research units uh to to			
initiate genetic engineering research in India			
Uh applications were invited and uh that's how 			
 a three units were established			
One in the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore uhm			
another in Bose Institute Calcutta and the third one in Jawaharlal Nehru			
University in Delhi 			
Later another unit was added and uh that was uh in Madurai			
 Kamraj University			
Uh the purpose was that they should serve as a focal point			
So that people from the nearby area could come and learn the			
techniques and genetic engineering research can spread in the country			
Uh you know this has worked very well			
Now almost in all good biological laboratories in the			
country genetic engineering is being used 			
But that's how the whole thing was started 			
Uh coming to the next one 			
In fact I wanted to ask you after this brief background which			
is not a very long history for genetic engineering to start in India 			
Eighty-two is not far off 			
What is the current status of genetic engineering research uh			
in India or in it's labs of India ?			
Uh uh the current status uh is is a very encouraging I			
must say			
And uh uhm if I may go back again uhm to what I was saying			
Uh each of these centres three units of genetic engineering uh			
 was uh entrusted with the job of doing a particular kind of genetic			
engineering research in the country			
Uhm uhm the unit in Jawaharlal Nehru University was			
supposed to work on uh the molecular genetic of nitrogen fixation 			
You have mentioned that your unit of which you are the			
director is endowed with the responsibility of uh carrying out			
research on nitrogen fixation			
 That's right 			
So uh will you elaborate a little bit what is nitrogen			
fixation ?			
Because we keep hearing about nitrogen fixing yes			
 microbe yes and perhaps they have some other			
 Yes 			
 Yes 			
Yes			
The the meaning of nitrogen fixation chemically uh is			
reduction of a molecular nitrogen 			
And uh when I was a student or you were a student we've			
 heard about the Hoberbosh process yeah of uh 			
industrially reducing nitrogen			
Uh but uh you know there are micro-organisms who can			
also reduce nitrogen on that			
Reduce nitrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure			
You don't have to go very high uh in the temperature or			
pressure 			
And this micro-organisms uh reduce nitrogen and form amonia			
and its derivatives 			
And that's what is biological nitrogen fixation 			
And I don't have to uh overemphasis the importance of this			
because uh uh this is the only source of all nitrogenous compounds in			
the living world 			
Like the meat or fish we consume today though uh the the			
animals or the fish cannot fix nitrogen they live on plants 			
right and and the plants cannot fix nitrogen so they get the nitrogen			
fixed from the microbes 			
So so bb this fixed nitrogen is is the only biological			
source in addition to of course the industrially fixed nitrogen			
 Yeah 			
 Right 			
Fixed nitrogen			
Yes 			
So these nitrogen fixtures as you say are microbes and			
your work is also related to them			
Yes 			
So uh there may be many types of uh nitrogen			
fixing or of many types 			
 Sure there are many there are many types uh uhm			
 if I may classify them 			
Uh generally speaking wa you 			
could uh uh group them in a classes like symbiotic			
nitrogen fixation 			
Uh which means that the micro-organisms by themselves 			
cannot fix nitrogen but they must uh enter into a symbiotic arrangement			
 with a particular plant 			
Uh uhm and the genous risobium yeah and uh 			
I'm sure this is a very familiar name uh is is the one which does it			
 Yeah 			
So uh the genous the various species of risobium would			
enter into symbiotic relationship with various leguminous plants 			
except for one or two plants 			
 For one or two plants 			
By legu excuse me by leguminous plants you mean 			
the pulses			
 That's right			
Uh uh			
Leguminous plants uh uh are are the pulses 			
one word yeah and uh since India is uh a a big vegetarian uh 			
diet consuming uh country the pulses are very important source of 			
uh nitrogen			
 One word 			
Nitrogen or protein 			
Even if one is a non-vegetarian because the cost of			
non-vegetarian food is very high			
So the general mass of the country would live on vegetarian			
dishes 			
And the pulses are very important suppliers of nitrogen 			
So these risobia they uh enter into an association			
 with these leguminous plants			
 That's right 			
And then the what have what is the benefit of			
that association			
I will tell you			
The form what you call nodules which can be very small or			
slightly big in the roots of these plants			
And some stray instances of shoot or stem nodules also			
But generally speaking root nodules 			
And as a result uh a lot of fix nitrogen would be given to			
the plant 			
So that the legumes uh would fo form			
 the crop 			
Uh fixing atmospheric nitrogen uh by using these bacterial			
species 			
Uh this is one kind uh			
There is another kind which we call associative nitrogen			
fixation where the plant uh would associate themselves with 			
micros micro-organisms			
But there is no uh uh rigid symbiotic arrangement 			
And that uh kind of syn uh uh fixation of nitrogen			
 is very important for nonlegumes 			
The cereal plants for example like uh we rice 			
rice etcetera			
 Right 			
Uhm uhm			
And as a spirillum this is one important genus uh			
which enters into association with cereal plants 			
There could be a third class where there is no association 			
The micro organisms can fix nitrogen in a free living state			
Doesn't need any plant nothing and as agrobactor is an			
example of the third class			
And today in India both as a spirillum species and as			
agrobactor species are used in the fields for cereal plants to augument			
the crop production			
And there is absolutely no doubt that both these uh impart			
beneficial affect to cereal crop production 			
Prof Das you are working on uh a agrobactor 			
uh on NDIE uhm uhm uh which is a free living nitrogen			
fixture 			
So why have you uh selected this field to work out its			
genetics or bio fixing ?			
 Uhm uhm 			
You see uh uh I I'm I'm basically a bio-chemist			
And uh I I had been uh quite attracted by a agrobactor uh			
because of uh mainly two reasons 			
One is that though in general this nitrogen fixation a			
machinery inside a cell is very sensitive to oxygen 			
In agrobactor the fixatiion goes on in air in the 			
presence of oxygen 			
 Yeah yeah 			
So it has its own mechanism by which it protects the			
nitrogen fixation machinery which is not there in other organisms			
Uh uh some organisms can protect but only when some			
specialised structures are formed			
But in agrobactor the the cell by itself does it			
This was one very interesting point for us to get interest in			
agrobactor 			
The other point was of course that uh we wanted to work			
with something that would be useful for cereal crops 			
Uh because that's by far uh the uh the more			
important crop in India			
Uhm and of course slowly we have learnt that there are many			
other interesting points in agrobactor as we have worked with agrobactor			
Like it has some alternative pathways of nitrogen fixation 			
Which uh possibly is not there in the other conventional 			
uh bacterial species			
So besides uh this alternative pathway for nitrogen			
fixation 			
Uh what are the other uh unique findings that have uh uh			
been done in your lab ?			
Uhm			
Or in under in your directorship ?			
Sure uh uhm 			
Or you can elaborate that this is the only thing			
which contains everything itself 			
 Yes if I can tell everything itself 			
Yes 			
Agrobactor we have learnt the has another unique			
character 			
Uh and that is it has a huge amount of DNA in it 			
DNA as you know is the is the genetic material and uh 			
uh for a bacteria uh it is really huge			
Uh the standard in bacteria is considered to be the micro			
organism one word which all of us have in the in organs			
 It's friendly bacteria which synthesises vitamins in us			
And agrobactor has as much as forty times more DNA in in its			
single cell 			
And that's what has attracted our attention			
 Might have one word 			
And we have recently uh uh established that agrobactor			
 one word has as many as eighty chromosomes in it 			
Which are almost the size uh of an one word 			
chromosome 			
But uh altogether eighty chromosomes uh looks like all of			
them are similar 			
And nobody knows why they are there and what they are doing			
And this is what is of interest to us at this present			
moment			
So in addition to the nitrogen fixation uh interest that			
we have first agrobactor this is also another interesting point uh 			
that needs attention in agrobactor 			
Uh these microbes that you have talked about are			
also doing another job that is they are economising on the fertilizer			
requirement of the crop that means it has some application			
in agriculture			
 That's right 			
Very much so very much 			
So uh can you please elaborate on on those aspects 			
 that's 			
 You see uh uh you see the most effective			
 the biological fertilizer is of course risobium 			
The effect that you get is is a much more striking in case			
of risobium 			
Uh but the problem with risobium is that uh you can use it			
only for legumes			
Or the or the pulses			
Uhm uhm 			
Uh dals that we take uh			
And there's absolutely no doubt that it it brings up			
yield several wholes high 			
But in the case of one word agrobactor it's 			
not as good as as risobium			
But again uh risobium cannot do anything for your cereal crops			
Yeah			
And for cereal crops uh it has been established that 			
uh again it's in the field 			
Not not just in the lab that uh uh it it it gives an			
yield somewhere could be anywhere between ten to forty percent more			
 Haan 			
And for some fodder crops the yield could be even			
double 			
And specifically only for fodder crops			
 Using uhm agrobactor 			
So you simply uh inoculate the seed with these bacteria			
 and then sow the seed 			
 Uhm uhm 			
And there the micro organisms multiply and then			
supply the nitrogen 			
And the other point is that it not only uhm has the good			
effect on that crop the crop that comes next also gets the benefit			
because some of the fix nitrogen stay on in the soil 			
And the next crop also getting gets the benefit 			
of this inoculation 			
 Gets the benefit 			
Uh since you are uh heading such a good and			
dedicated scientists team of genetic engineering unit uh there			
previously there was a euphoria of genetic engineering 			
Now we hear quite often of biotechnology 			
Uh since you are an expert in this area can you uh tell us 			
uh is there any distinction between the two or do they overlap or they			
are one and the same thing			
No uh let me put it this way uh Genetic Engineering			
is included in biotechnology 			
Uh the the so much that you hear about biotechnology today I			
dare say is because of genetic engineering			
Because biotechnology was there like like the wine that			
was there from the time immemorial			
Yeah			
You you you could consider it as a biotechnological 			
uh uh phenomenon yeah preparing a wine 			
 Yeah 			
Or even the gober gas that you hear so			
much about is biotechnology uh but it's the			
genetic engineering uh development of genetic engineering that has given			
a real boost to biotechnology 			
 A few words 			
Uh genetic engineering is included in biotechnology but			
biotechnology uh could deal with other things also like tissue culture			
Which is also very important today 			
Like certain certain plants have been propogated by tissue culture			
And those are disease free plants 			
And there there is no genetic engineering but thats included			
in biotechnology 			
Or or even this conventional vaccine making is is			
biotechnology			
But I am sure you heard that now you you have better			
vaccines which have been uh constructed using genetic engineering tools			
or one word tools 			
That means biotechnology was already there very			
much but genetic engineering provided uh tools which has hasten			
the process of			
 Very much 			
 That's that's the way I I I would look at			
biotechnology today 			
Prof Das do you think that whatever you are doing or your			
group or genetic engineers are doing in India or all over do they			
have any relevance to the people or masses ?			
Like your organism for example has uh the direct benefit 			
in agriculture 			
What are the other areas where we can uhm make best use of this			
 uh genetic engineering unit or genetic engineering researches or			
researches in modern biology			
There can be many examples and some of these have been			
tried abroad 			
I I I will start with an example which I always give and 			
that's the example of human insulin 			
You know the uh all diabetics must take insulin 			
Now insulin is naturally made in the pancreas of animals			
including us 			
So when we fail to make our own insulin we have to take			
insulin from outside 			
And that insulin used to come only from animal pancreas 			
So animals would have to be slaughtered and the insulin would			
have to be isolated and then processed and we take injection 			
Uh so that's what they have done is they had projected			
the need of insulin 			
And they have found that they would soon come when you just			
would not able to kill as many animals to supply the uh insulin			
This is point number one 			
 Recording broken 			
A legend in his lifetime known as the greatest gentleman tennis			
player of the world			
Certainly India's greatest tennis player ever			
And right now he is with us in our studios Mr Ramanathan Krishnan			
Mr Krishnan welcome to our studios and thank you very much for			
 being with us			
Thank you Deepak 			
Uh we would like to take you down memory lanes yeah			
 we would like to travel into the past			
 Yeah 			
Tell us about how you got involved in tennis ?			
Yes uhm see I come from a tennis playing family 			
It all my father started the whole thing 			
And he used to be a good player in his playing days that was			
before the war time 			
And he used them 			
He was the best player in the south and he was one of the top			
ranking Indian player 			
So he he put me into tennis 			
And then infact he put Ramesh also to into			
 tennis 			
Who coached you in your earliest days ?			
My father has been my main my main coach 			
Uh he started coaching me when I was about ten years old 			
That was used to be you know that you people used			
to consider quite younger that time			
But today they start as early as five or six know 			
I started when I was about ten years old 			
And uh my father went to for some			
rigorous programmes for me			
Lot of training and lot of practice sessions and uh it was hard			
work 			
Uhm now the emphasis appears to be on physical fitness as much			
as on proficiency in the game 			
And at the time when you were being coached ?			
Well Deepak it has been the same 			
I mean if you take tennis for last forty fifty years 			
And in fact people ask me How do you compare a champion			
of a nineteen twenties or thirties ?			
You know I've not seen them but you know I talked			
to people and uh champions of todays			
I think that one common factor that is physical fitness 			
They all had to be phy physically 			
 very fit and uh it is only athletes who can play this game			
well 			
What kind of equipment and facilities did you have when you			
started playing tennis ?			
Well uh you can't compare it with todays 			
Facilities are much more today 			
But in my playing days for instance we used to play with wooden			
rackets 			
Now you see no rackets of graphite and aluminium and uh 			
there're so many varieties of rackets now 			
 It's an improvement because with uh less effort 			
you're able to get more pace 			
The pace is an advantage for the modern players			
We didn't had that 			
But then we're good players of the time like take			
Rod Laver			
Uh I mean he played with the wooden rackets			
And Lu Hoad or Jack Kramer they hit the ball as hard because			
 they had a very good timing 			
So it's a question of I mean I do agree that the			
equipment is better 			
But you know once you you know as an athlete who is very			
talented I mean you you give my him 			
broomstick he can play tennis well 			
Was it possible to make a living out of tennis I'm			
 sorry to put such a material no no question to you			
Was it possible to do that ?			
 No no 			
Very interesting question			
Very good question 			
And it used to be amateur sports those days 			
Like I was an amateur player			
And Rod Laver in his earlier days and Lu Hoad they're 			
all amateurs 			
Then they turn professional later on 			
And uh it was a mainly an amateur sports 			
In fact those days unfortunately they used to look down on the			
professionals you know			
So they were very few in number 			
They used to be under group under Jack Kramer 			
And uh in nineteen sixty things have changed			
And the status of the game has changed now 			
Now it's a professional sport 			
A full time job and uh luc lucrative			
 career for the top players 			
Mr Krishnan there is one question that is lot of people have			
always wanted to ask you 			
Forgive me for this question but having reached the peak 			
 yeah all of a sudden Ramanathan Krishnan just sort of went away			
Hang out his racket and he went away 			
Uh you you didn't get interested in coaching you didn't			
want to take an active part in the management of tennis in this country			
 Yeah 			
Well uh I didn't hang up my racket quickly			
I mean I had a pretty long innings 			
I mean I played for quiet a long time you know I had a long innings			
you know			
 Laughs 			
I played nearly yeah twenty-five to thirty			
years 			
 Yeah 			
In fact I had three life's in tennis 			
First I was playing you know my best playing days is in the			
fifties and the sixties 			
Then I quit for sometime 			
And uh when Ramesh started improving his tennis I thought 			
it's a good idea to you know compete with him and uh you know			
practice with him which would help him which it did 			
So I came back in the seventies seventy-four or			
seventy-five around that time			
And Ramesh was coming up 			
Then Ramesh was on his own feet improved and went you know went			
the circuit			
I quit again 			
And finally in the early eighties around eighty-two they			
introduced a new event called the grand masters meant for ex-tennis			
players 			
You know who've done well in the earlier years 			
But they're too old to compete in regular competition			
They call it a grand masters events 			
It was the assembly of ex-champions ex-tennis players 			
So I was invited to take part in that in the main in United			
States and a few tournaments in Europe 			
So I competed again again against people like Rod Laver			
Kanross Wall all big legendary names you know 			
I enjoyed it and uh it was lot of fun and that's also			
finished now because you know the reason 			
New forty-fives are now coming in laughter 			
You know when I was forty-five			
 I'm fifty-four now played for nearly nine ten years			
And I we had lot of fun and we had good competition 			
And now the new forty-fives you know for event like that you			
always need some new blood ah 			
So the new forty-fives are now coming you know the reason 			
 Ah 			
They are already professionals in the rally			
 We're not professional yes but the new			
persons are coming in			
So that event is going on now			
 Yes 			
Well this this senior collegue of mine here is nine			
hundred and ninety-five years old and he is going to learn tennis			
 in a little while			
 Ah ha 			
Ah ha			
But there is the question that that I I want to repeat it			
again Mr Krishnan yeah 			
Why has uh Mr Krishnan never been available for coaching ?			
 Yeah 			
Yeah you asked me that question 			
You see as I said that I kept playing uh the lesson			
important like I played the grand masters for eight nine years 			
Then in between I was travelling with Ramesh trying to help			
him for a few years			
When he need when he needed it 			
And I firmly believe that in this game you know 			
it's uh it's a long process 			
This coaching everything is not a quick process you know it takes			
years 			
If I take up two or three boys or four boys and I've			
 to live with them be with them right through			
And I couldn't do anything else 			
And it's a long process 			
I couldn't afford the time			
And I didn't want to you know takes stuck take up			
something half-heartedly and leave it in the middle 			
So this is one of the main reason 			
And uh in this country we've good coaches who teach			
the fundamentals of the game alright 			
Where we're lagging behind is when they improve the			
tennis they're a bit directionless 			
We here a little dicky bird a little rumour that's			
 Ramanathan Krishnan is now going to go in for coaching 			
Is there any truth in this ?			
Well uh yes I'm in the capital for two reasons			
One is to watch the Davis Cup match that's going on			
between India and Korea			
Which is at a very interesting stage			
In which in which your son played brilliantly			
 My son played very well 			
 He's been good yesterday 			
And uh I'm here also for another important reason 			
I met again dynamic man called Bobby Singh 			
Who is uh in organising a tennis academy 			
Uh tennis for tennis academy			
I believe he's going to have it in the capital in			
this area 			
And uh object is to unearth talents tennis talents 			
And then give them all the opportunities and uh you know give			
them the coaching and training facilities 			
So that you know take a group of some thirty forty boys			
and girls 			
So that out of the quantity a few good quality player may			
be three or four will come out in three years time			
 It's a very good idea 			
So he asked me when I was here last month passing through Delhi			
He Asked me whether I could help them or give them a little 			
few few tips and all 			
So I thought it's a good idea and uh you know 			
I've did away lot pressure out of game lot of things out of			
this game 			
So I said why not give that to game in some small way 			
So I said I agreed and uh right after the Davis Cup			
match I think around the nineth or tenth or a week I'm 			
going to be working with this uh young children			
Oh wonderful 			
 Jee saheb ab Krishnan saheb training de			
rahen hain naujawan bacchon ko			
Ek hafta das din ke liye desh ki rajdhani mei rahenge aur yahan			
par ek tennis coaching camp lag raha hai 			
Agar aap chahen to aap ke liye recommendation 			
mai de sakta hoon 			
 Deepakji pehli baat to yeh hai ke mere pas itni			
fursat nahin ah mai dekhye mai match dekhta			
hoon aur mujhe maza ajata hai aur mai gum hojata hoon 			
 Ah 			
 Usi liye itna wakht lag jata hai aur ab khelne ke			
liye after all agar panch hazar saal purani haddiyan hain to			
 kahin satak hi na jayen 			
 Laughs 			
 I'm sorry I said he was nine hundred and something			
he says he's five thousand years old			
 You'll have to be very young to one word			
 this game and play this game you know			
Which is very young laughs he's five			
thousand very young 			
 Laughs 			
Mr Krishnan what do you consider which match do you			
consider your greatest match ever ?			
Well as stated earlier I had a long inning			
Yeah			
So I had to mention two or three of them you know			
 Alright 			
I think uh I would always I mean all the listeners			
would expect me to say this laughter 			
The match against Thomas Coss which I played inter-zonal			
final against Brazilian Davis Cup competition nineteen sixty-six 			
That is very important because I was playing the fifth match			
It was two match for I was playing the fifth match and of			
course out on grass court which tend out to be a a marathon match			
a deciding match which I happen to win 			
 That's very important because that took the country to			
the final position they used to call it a challenge you know 			
The challenge for the Davis Cup was there for the first time 			
You know first time is always very important 			
And I always take pride in that that I broke that ice 			
And you know we've got to the finals			
It was a thrilling moments for other players Thomas Coss 			
And uh well uh that's about thirty years ago 			
nearly laughter twenty-five years ago			
 Laughs 			
Yeah then you're going to mention one or two other			
matches that			
This is the main one because you know it's a Davis			
Cup match 			
Another one is uh I always remembered my matches against			
Roy Emerson the quarter final at Wimbledon			
We played on the central court 			
I was seeded number seven			
He was number four 			
He was a favourite 			
I played exceptionally well on that day and I managed to be			
in great state uh which took me to the semi-final of Wimbledon for the			
second time 			
That was a very important match uh quality wise			
I played good tennis 			
And another one which I always remember is as against Rod			
Laver in the opening round the opening match of the Davis Cup competition			
inter-zone finals between India and Australia 			
We played the match in the United States 			
You know those days the rules of the games			
The rules of the Davis Cup competition were such that you know			
the nation that was holding the Cup			
You know today it's not like that			
Today everybody plays no ?			
Yeah			
But those days the nation which was holding the cup the			
holders they played only one match			
They played winners of the rest of the world 			
So on that that year I mean United States was holding the Cup			
Which meant we had to play the earlier matches like the inter-zone			
finals yeah in the United States 			
 Yeah 			
I played that match in Boston and beat Laver			
I mean I must confess that Rod Laver was that great			
He played afterwards with everybody 			
But even then he was the Wimbledon finalist and uh 			
that gave me lot of pressure breathing in because I realise how talented he			
was and uh I won in four serve 			
I always remember that match 			
When you reached the semi-finals of the Wimbledon for the			
first time yeah before went to play that match 			
 yeah what did you do ?			
And after you played it what did you do ?			
 You knew that you've beaten 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Ah yeah I'll tell you something			
Looking back well I know certain things which I shouldn't have			
done			
 It's too late 			
Thats what happened in happens you know			
 in all walks of life you make some mistakes			
I did make a mistake 			
Somewhere on I was over awed at that occasion 			
But I got in the semi-finals at Wimbledon			
I was over awed 			
You know it's only two matches to win to win the title I			
was very close to it 			
And the people who I'm playing I had beaten them here			
and there 			
You know it's not that they had always beaten me but			
uh I've one occasion I lost to Neil Fraser neat serve uh another			
occasion Rod Laver			
Second level Rod Laver in sixty-one 			
And you know it's interesting to know that I've			
 not lost to Lord Laver until then 			
But on that occasion I was over awed and they were two two			
of the best out pass two of the left that left handed again its known 			
It so happened I had to play them on fast grass court			
This I wouldn't play well and uh they were the better players			
But I think if uh I should have been little more you know it			
is one word a little more ambitious and you know I			
played normally			
I should have done something extra bit you know			
On an occasion like that you can't afford to play just normal			
tennis and get away			
 You've to do something extra			
Which I didn't do 			
 Deepekji hamesha ki tarah aap meri baat mehmen tak			
pahuncha dijiye 			
Dekhye morning show ke lakho dost jo Bharat			
ke puri abadi ke pratinidhi hai mai un sab ki taraf se mehman ka shukriya ada			
karta hoon 			
Mehman ni Bhartiya tennis ke liye jo kuch kiya			
hai woh nai khiladiyon ko hamesha rasta dikhata rahega 			
Meri aur morning show ke doston ki ek chhoti si			
khwaish hai ho sakta hai woh mehman ki koshish se unki saakh se 			
ya unki sifarish se puri ho jaye 			
Is mahan desh ke kisi bhi ek saher main ek shandar			
 tennis stadium ban jaye to hamari woh hasrat puri ho			
jaye jo Australian Open French Open ya 			
Wimbledon ko dekh kar hamare dil mei paida hoti hai 			
What ?			
Do you wish to respond to what he has said ?			
Uh I understood him ahn 			
Well as far as I'm concerned I'll be 			
 rewarded and rewarded and very happy 			
If we produce you know large country like India 			
if we get two or three or four good players and good tennis			
stadium yeah tennis court and everything 			
 Ahn 			
 Yes yes 			
 And good tennis stadium 			
That would be nice because you know we've 			
worked very hard in this game 			
I would like somebody to keep up this game and you know keep			
the flag flying and uh I would like to again grow that's my			
ambition 			
Uh Mr Krishnan coming back to your reputation as a gentleman			
tennis player			
Now you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to			
but I've heard again from your comtemporaries yeah 			
that if there was ever a line called which the empire awarded in your			
favour but you thought that it belong to the to your opponent 			
then the next point you would deliberately return the ball into the net 			
Is that true ?			
That you would you would you know equalise			
 Yeah 			
Well I will tell you the truth now			
I can afford to tell you the truth now laughter that 			
I've close my tennis year 			
This morning we have with us Mahasveta Devi the			
eminent Bengali writer visiting Delhi 			
Mahasveta Devi was born in Dhaka which is now in Bangladesh and			
pursued her academic career in Vishwabharati Shantiniketan			
 and also later in the Calcutta University			
Interestingly she did her M A in English literature 			
Mahasveta Devi is a social activist a journalist and a			
vibrant creative writer			
She has taught at school and college level English literature			
Also she has been a roving reporter of two Bengali dailies 			
 Vartuman and Yugantur mainly			
reporting on the matters related to villages 			
She is also a person who has a store house of varied experiences			
because she has garner them from the different areas of life 			
It is interesting to know for us that she has also worked in the			
Telegraph and Postal Department of India 			
She has been working clears throat with the 			
adivasis of India working with them and they are in			
Orissa Bihar and Bengal 			
Presently she is concentrating more in Bengal 			
And she draws her inspiration and authentic power that comes			
from empathy and deep sustained identification and concern for the deprived			
and the neglected 			
She has to her credit forty-two novels sixteen books of			
collected short stories 			
A book of plays amongst which we can very happily name the			
 uh Hazar Chaurasia's Maa 			
five books for children 			
She has also received several medals			
And it is a big list to go through but let me mention the			
 Amrita Puraskaar Jagataruni Medal 			
Nikhil Bharat Bang Sahitya Puraskaar Bhuvan Mohini Medal			
 and also Padmashree in			
nineteen eighty-six for her excellent work with the 			
adivasis of India 			
Her works have been translated in Malyali Gujarati			
 Hindi Telugu Tamil and certainly in English 			
And I'm very happy to tell you as far as I know 			
her books are used in several universities in Australia and the			
United States 			
Mahasveta Devi it is great pleasure to have this			
opportunity to meet you face to face because we have always enjoyed that			
excellent creative vibrant writing of yours and we all welcome you in			
 Delhi and to our studio 			
Thank you 			
Uhm the question that comes to mind right away and which			
 I've read in the introduction of that excellent book of collection			
uh Apni Godko is it the			
transformation in society for survival of the least and the downtrodden			
 is a mm major concern of yours ?			
But you do not believe as I understand in the change of political			
 methods or cha change of the			
system by political methods 			
What would be your solution for this very pressing problem in our			
country this transformation of society ?			
Would you suggest it can be done through literary writing ?			
I think it would be more correct to say that I don't			
think any political system as we see in India would bring 			
any revolutionary change for the downtrodden and the oppressed 			
And it I it would be very what shall I say wishful thinking			
to say that only literary writing could bring some changes 			
Of course it will have some effect on the 			
litery literary section of the society 			
But to bring any transformation efforts should			
try should be tried 			
You know from the grass root level not from the upper level			
And the process will be slow process will be gradual and			
there must be concerted efforts to better the condition of the			
downtrodden the oppressed 			
I don't mean always by government methods 			
By voluntary organisations or other dedicated people 			
Only thus slowly uh better society can emerge 			
And this work must be done along with those who have suffered			
This work not only must be done along with those who have			
suffered but the initiative also must come from them 			
They will work for their own betterment 			
Uh how much have you been impressed by your 			
Shantiniketan experience in this uh thought for the 			
downtrodden the deprived the neglected ?			
I wouldn't say that Shantiniketan 			
upbringing made me very conscious for the downtrodden and the			
oppressed 			
I was in Shantiniketan in my childhood when			
Tagore was alive 			
 I'm very thankful for those childhood days 			
 Shantiniketan taught me a great love of			
nature love for humanity in general 			
But the later phase which is me now it has come after many			
changes and ups and downs in my life			
And you have had a varied experience in your life 			
Please tell us you often use in your writing my people 			
and that's the phrase that has really struck me			
Because I have come across it several times 			
I would like to know what exactly do you mean when you say 			
my people you do you use this phrase in a very			
particular way or as queens and kings use my people			
No the for the queens and kings it would be my			
subject 			
But for me the suffering bonded labourers of Paramu they are			
my people 			
 The Times of India report regarding a woman			
 three months ago in Madhya Pradesh who was tubercular and who			
sold her daughter for as a child labour for hundred 			
rupees 			
 She's one of my people 			
You see my India consists of such people who for whom			
still drinking water or right over their land and forest a hut			
 two meals a day remains a luxury 			
They are my people 			
Where I say people I mean they 			
And this is your sustained deep identification with this			
particular group			
Yes 			
Uhm I was wondering when you say that you are 			
sensitive about the judgement on the writers you have also said that			
they are answerable the writers 			
I was going to ask you is a writer responsible for the state of			
a negative uh situation in our country in society the immoral unethical			
values ?			
Uhm are do you really think it is			
the job of the writer to reflect the society ?			
Because we have been saying for ages literature is the			
mirror of society 			
Or do you think it is the duty of these writer to present the			
 picture truthfully but also work for the solution ?			
I mean is it one of the work of the writer and if he or she fails			
there that she should be ready for judgement ?			
What I wanted to say I put it to you as a counter 			
 it's not question some thing else 			
A writer is a person who lives in the society			
She does			
A writer receives so much from society but he is also			
accountable to the society 			
He has also give given that so a 			
writer's writing should not lead the society astray 			
Or a writer's vary todays writings of the Indian			
writers from all over India does it reflect the true India ?			
The India is passing through many phases passing through many			
changes 			
So uh d d do it lit the Indian literature			
until and unless becomes the mirror of the Indian changing			
Indian society I wouldn't say that the writers have been very			
successful 			
Also I believe in activism 			
I believe in active work 			
So I think this these writers also			
should be conscious of their res social			
responsibilities 			
Try to alleviate the misery of the poor and the suffering as			
much as they can 			
I think this should give him better identification with his			
reading public			
This is a very very excellent point			
Because very few I think feel 			
Not only the writers but let's say citizens of India			
 that we have received so much from society therefore we are bound to			
 them to give back in whatever way we can			
And what you are saying as a writer it is one of your duties that			
you consider is to get back as much as you can			
Yes			
Since you are a writer 			
So that some wrong impression that we have that because she is			
an activist therefore she is always bringing in these subjects is not			
such a true picture as the moral and ethical value have as a writer			
That a writer as a citizen writer as a taker of social good 			
must give back not wait for any one to ask it			
Yes			
I think uh uh Mahasveta Devi this is very excellent point			
and I am happy that you are sharing this with us 			
The other thing I wanted to say in this regard would you say			
then the readers who read your work really owe it to you because many			
of us are your admirers that they also do something actual work 			
What would you suggest for them ?			
Whoever is uh aware 			
Wherever one is he must consider it as his or her			
battlefield jo jidher hai wohi unke liye unaka ranakshetra hai			
 			
One must think of oneself as a soldier 			
You see our India is a very poor mother 			
She has so many children 			
The advanced amongst them should not be totally oblivious			
of the misery of her poorer children 			
Everyone should try to do whatever one can			
Uhm I'm sure we'll remember that 			
Mahasveta Devi I wanted to ask you please share with us and I			
see in not uh far away future those who you are working for the			
 adivasis the neglected the uh forgotten will come into			
the mainstream of life 			
I can't prophecy when but they will 			
But when they come how do you visualise the quality of life			
changing atleast beginning to change ?			
Hitherto what has happened that uh oppressed as a class			
the tribals amongst us have been totally bypassed by the 			
mainstre mainstream society 			
Especially the tribals 			
Great injustice has been done to them			
Absolutely 			
Indian history of uh freed Indian freedom			
history does not include the tribal anti-imperialist uh			
struggle as part of Indian history 			
Thus the tribals have always been bypassed 			
I do not want them to come forward because of mercy from			
the main stream 			
They must know where they are			
They must struggle for their own good and they must 			
advance themselves 			
Only thus whatever they are that will be his or her own			
earning that is she will be able to retain 			
If you give someone something yes one may not			
value it so much 			
 Yes 			
Ah this is a very excellent point			
I wanted to say that I have noticed that you have a 			
expression of happiness when you are talking about your readers who are non-			
Bengali readers 			
And I know that you are very well known amongst the			
 non-Bengali readers through translations 			
I wanted to ask you to what do you owe this 			
gratification and love from them			
 One or two words 			
That is one of the turning phases of my life 			
Because by the time I had written Hazar			
Chourasia ki Maa I had written Jungle 			
Ke Jahagirdar 			
But those books were not yet translated into Hindi 			
Hindi in Hindi plenty Bengali literature was being			
translated and published 			
But not my books 			
Different kind of literature 			
Arvind kumar now the director of L B T then he had			
 Radhakrishna Prakashan 			
He not only published my books by going forward travelling to			
Calcutta but introduced me to a people unknown to me hi			
hi hitherto 			
Hindi writers poets patrakars so many people			
I met in Delhi 			
It was like a mela 			
Whenever I came I met them 			
It was like a festive occasion 			
On one occasion there was really a mela like			
festival around me in Triveni 			
Arvind one word and had I not known Hindi 			
readers had I not known the Hindi world of literature I would not			
have known greater India 			
Hindi introduced me to greater India 			
I agree this I'm no longer I do no longer feel 			
I'm a Bengali writer			
I feel I am a Indian writer and I belong to the rest of India			
Amongst the Indian writers I have so many friends 			
For all these things I am very very indebted to the Hindi			
literature very very indebted to Arvind Kumar			
So we now see the great value of translation 			
There is just probably a little time for you to share any			
particular thought that is dear to your heart with your audience 			
I will just tell you a very small incident which is very			
important to me 			
In a remote tribal area of Bengal twenty years ago there was			
no school 			
And because there was no land available to build a hut for the			
school a tribal woman Karmisuren she had very little land she			
induced interest upon her son and daughter-in-law to part with whatever			
land they had 			
This poorest woman in the village gave her all 			
An illiterate woman so that a school could could be built 			
for others to get education 			
 Karmisuren's instance till date is a great one a			
pioneering effect to me 			
And I always say that school I think it will be it will			
be government sanctioned very soon			
I do not know 			
We are trying hard 			
My state government is also trying trying hard 			
But Karmisuren is a great woman whose life should be written			
 and should reach other parts of India			
And I would add let us also act like Karmisuren and			
Mahasveta Devi thank you for spending this beautiful time with us 			
Thank you so much 			
In all good ever hope to be 			
That then what they conventional wisdom 			
Until beginning nineteen eighty-seven All India Radio undertook			
a series of broadcast in India a new experiment in integrated social			
broadcasting of a style magnitude and complexity unprecedented anywhere			
in the world 			
These broadcasts have been a spectacular success 			
The credit for this goes to the vision the dedication the			
committment and the leadership of one man 			
His name Amrit Rao Shinde 			
His job Director General of All India Radio			
And right now as you can see he is with us in our studio 			
Mr Shinde sir thank you very much for joining us in the studios of			
the morning show 			
Now you began with the series on social forestry in nineteen			
eighty-seven 			
Then you moved on to method of science to Jeevan Saurabh			
 to radio date and so on			
What is the origin of this idea ?			
How did you decide that radio should now play some kind of a			
more active role in social broadcasting ?			
After the introduction of colour television in India 			
uh in fact we in broadcasting the professionals were little disturbed			
because the listening has shifted to television 			
And because one factor was dominating 			
The programme pattern of radio was not very attractive to			
the listeners 			
Secondly the television the new media which was progressing in			
this country and expanding uh with a great speed was able to			
provide a lot of entertainment good entertainment quiet good			
entertainment 			
So we were worried that how we can shift our programme			
pattern in such a way where we can attract the listeners and			
keep our uh uh listening to the optimum 			
In search of this we have arranged many seminars and			
workshop at different places 			
I have moved from places to places I have discussed uh the			
problems with professionals 			
And uh we come came to the			
conclusion especially in the light of success of radio form			
 forum especially programmes for the rural audiences			
That if we go in for subjects and programmes which are			
directly concerned to a listener and where they are in need of some			
information or where they are in need of some guidance and where they			
are uh looking for more kind of education 			
I think that area if we adopt and feel what the listeners see			
in that programming I'm sure this uh we can achieve the			
success desired 			
And the first experiment we started at A I R Bangalore in			
nineteen eighty-seven 			
The programme series was known as Nisarg Sampada 			
social forestry 			
And this programme was planned in collaboration and			
cooperation with this uh one word Forest Department of Karnataka			
government 			
And we worked out thirteen episodes 			
And uh those thirteen episodes were evolved after discussing			
with various communicators experts and at taking a tryst in			
the field 			
Total of programmes we took in the field			
And uh we assessed the success of the and impact of			
the programme on the listeners 			
And then we made some changes in the formats 			
And we thought we should use two-way communication system 			
to be more effective 			
And that is what we adopted			
And it proved very successful 			
This particular programme was subsequently introduced on all			
India basis in fifteen languages 			
And for that purpose we invited applications from our listeners			
to register forest one word 			
So response was our plan was to register about one 			
lakh listeners throughout the country 			
But the response was so tremendous as we got hundred and forty			
thousand and we felt that it is important for us to one word 			
we requested the listeners the register has stop 			
So that was the uh response in the beginning 			
Then after the completion of the series			
 Duri come series we got number of letters and it was			
 unmanageble for us 			
And we conducted open book examination to just assess			
 how much our programme has been successful 			
How much information the listener has retained 			
It is not only that it they listen it 			
But whether have they have acquired this and			
retained it that is very important factor 			
And through these open examinations we observed that more than			
seventy-five persons percent of the 			
registered listeners appeared for the open book examination 			
And their degree of infor knowledge was about			
seventy-three percent correct 			
And large number of of exa the prizes were given			
to the first and that was the how we got into the new format			
Uhm uh sir did you face any kind of scepticism laughs			
 when you decided to launch this revolutionary series of broadcast			
 ?			
Yes of course because uh among we professionals 			
there is always a tendency that we always uh want to glorify the past 			
And uh there is always a resistence for new ideas new			
experiments 			
And it was there 			
And people thought but who is going to attain and suggest			
after all people know about it 			
They are for years together they know about forest			
What new things you are going to impart 			
And it is a very cumbersome thing with no achievement about it 			
But I said Let us try and do it 			
Let us see how we get this one because unless we try 			
we will never know whether we are going correctly or not correctly			
Or whether we should pursue this particular format or not 			
And after the efforts were done the series was introduced and			
concluded 			
We found it was the most successful format that's good			
 to a listeners beyond our expectations 			
 Pichhle sal All India Radio ne ye			
abhiyan kiya jisse jis karyakram ko aap ne Radio Date ka			
nam diya hai Date standing for uh what what's the			
actual name for 			
Uh Radio Date Date drug alcohol tobacco 			
education			
Right			
Now you did this in thirty episode which is the largest radio			
series of its kind anywhere in the world right 			
Uh what prompted you to go in for this ?			
What have been your experiences ?			
What were the shortcomings if any that you noticed ?			
And what is your assessment of this experiment ?			
 Right 			
See uh as a broadcaster we always lookout for some			
area and subjects 			
And any problem we come across we always want to see from the			
angle of whether we can use this subject for programming and we can			
 use our uh technique of communication for the wider uh 			
information and acceptance 			
Uh it is actually I myself was a chain smoker 			
For ten years I was smoking fifty cigars per day 			
And nineteen sixty-two I left it once for all for one or			
two words 			
One day I was coming from uh Malaysia via Singapore			
At the airport I saw a very good looking charming one word			
 air-hostess was sitting there 			
And within two minutes I found she started smoking and the whole			
 her uh uh facial expression that whole thing has changed 			
And that struck me whether this particular subject we should			
take in 			
Because uh tobacco as you know there is no control 			
You can sell tobacco anywhere and talk to anybody 			
There is no control of smoking 			
Any person from child five years to ninety years smokes no			
control over it 			
No restriction on the place of smoking 			
There is restriction for the drinking 			
There are dry areas			
But for tobacco consumption there is no restriction no law at			
all uhm 			
So I thought this is area which is common so commonly 			
spread over this ha ha habit or what can			
say addiction			
So radio can play very important role because the reach of			
radio is very much high and interior area especially 			
And uh among the underprevileged classes so we thought we			
should work out on these bases 			
But how to work out how to go about it 			
So we actually uh approached the I C C M R uh to			
whether they can help us with this research and uh information			
whether we can uh work out			
And then in collaboration with this 			
We evolved this series like Radio Date 			
because they adviced that that we should also include drugs and uh			
 uhm alchohol also as a part of the whole series			
And that's how we started the series 			
And we involved number of experts who have done lot of research			
work in tobbaco areas			
And it was found that the every druggist or alcoholic			
person has graduated from smoking 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm			
He initially smoking smoked and			
then he has gone to that level 			
So everybody was con uh convinced that this			
series must be taken very seriously and we should do uh something 			
and contribute something substantial for the improvement of this one			
word health and over all atmosphere 			
And thats how this we started working on it 			
And then thereafter we worked out the format 			
And same methodology adopted 			
First we we conducted a workshop in fifteen languages 			
we prepared prototypes 			
Took the one word in the field tested them and			
came back			
And whatever the deficiencies we found out 			
During the testing they were removed 			
And then final programme was gone mass production 			
And the same technique was adopted			
We invited application called the registrations 			
Because we wanted that our listeners should be the same			
listener throughout the series			
And he should be seriously involved 			
And we were happy to know that everybody were listener			
 who registered himself was communicating with us 			
And the impact was so tremendous that there number			
of people who wrote to us that they've given up smoking 			
Uhm 			
Yes			
Now I C M R is conducting a post broadcast research at			
Bangalore and Calcutta 			
That those people who wrote to us and they gave up the smoking			
or drug addiction thing 			
What is happening to them thereafter ?			
Uhm 			
So that was the impact of this particular series 			
As a television person uh my heart is with television			
 laughs 			
You will appreciate that 			
My mind agrees with what you were saying sir 			
But now this experience that you've gained from this			
earlier series on methods of science jeevan sourabh jo aapane kiya			
aur ab radio date ka aapane jikar kiya			
To jo aapko tajurba huwa anubhav huwa hain uske aadhar par ab			
aap kya karne lage hain ?			
 Ab hamne ek naya serial uh kiya hain 			
human evolution manushya ka vikas 			
Ye serial ek kaafi lamba serial			
 hoga abhi tak mere khayalse kisi dunya mei aise vishay par itna			
lamba serial banaya nahin gaya aur manushka 			
vikas ka jo hissa hain we were one word much of the 			
one word isme bhi hamane bahutse institution			
 ko liya hai Tata Fundamental Research bhi isme			
 involve hain aur uh this National Council			
of Science and Technology also been involved 			
Some eminent scientists are involved Dr S R Rao and some			
persons 			
And we have worked out the one word now doing last one			
and half year we were working on this project 			
 Aur ab ye saara complete ho chuka			
hain do June se hum ye shure kar rahe hain 			
Aur is serial ka bhi technique wohi hain			
 ke registration of the listeners 			
 Aur uske baad listener se 			
communication 			
Two-way communication technique wohi tarika hoga 			
Aur uske baad in between we are going to have survey			
conducted 			
To see the impact of the series 			
The whole object appears our object is to generate a			
scientific temper 			
 Ki log har cheej ko vaigyanik drishti se dekhe 			
Ek aadat ban jaaye ki har cheej ko ye aisa aisa kyo hota hain ?			
Kaise hota hain ?			
Manushya kin kin awastha se kyo gujara hain ?			
Uska behaviour mein ye parivartan kaisa aaya			
 ?			
Why that one word changing ?			
And we have come from where to this stage ?			
And what is next ?			
Where are you going ahead ?			
So this kind of the different of facets of the human evolution			
 are going to be discussed in this series 			
Within a particular series like this one on human uh			
evolution the sub-subject how do you decide then ?			
That subject we discussed with various uh experts 			
And also we conducted surveys			
And we try we to assess ke which are			
the areas where the information is required more 			
And where are the areas where the information is very less			
available or the common listener has no access for that information 			
at his level in the villages or interior areas or in uh rural areas 			
So that kind of information we want to see			
It is vital information 			
And without that information the further information which we are			
going to give to them will not be relevant 			
So so that we have to link up those areas and see that			
there is no gap of information 			
As well as information which is needed to the listeners is			
given 			
Uhm 			
Let me be the devil's advocate for a moment 			
yeah 			
 Ye ye your experience obviously has demonstrated			
beyond the shadow of doubt that radio is still a very effective medium			
for social education and social change 			
Then what about uh family welfare family planning 			
 Yeah 			
That is another aspect I'm telling you			
Because family planning I think we are putting out more			
than six thousand programmes every month 			
And there also the success is so great that the latest			
surveys all the surveys which have been conducted for different places			
 have been uh uhn shown that the first source of information			
on family welfare was radio 			
Uhm all right			
Now on the table in front of us Mr Director General there are			
 these little kits lying			
Would you like to tell us what they are ?			
So this was the kits which were one or two words 			
method of science 			
So these kits were where you find the one word is			
there			
Let me			
It is on do you it yourselves			
I can just show you this			
This 			
Now these are the lenses which were supplied 			
Because there was some certain uh lessons were there			
And certain experiments were shown to the listener			
The kits were provide provided to one			
lakh forty thousand uh people all the registered 			
And this is the stone covering that particular experiment 			
So that the listener can himself try this experiment at			
home how the things work 			
Ah 			
And we also provided a chart a big huge chart was shown			
to them 			
This type			
Which one is it ?			
Is it the chart ?			
Yeah 			
This is it 			
You can see this is a chart of uh mega of science 			
See here			
Here 			
So every thing was available in advance with the			
listeners			
I see			
And that before the days programme was started they had to			
read this particular portion and also the questions were raised			
What kind of uh uh questions they can raise it 			
And when they listen the programme and then write to us and			
experiment with this kit 			
Uhm this is obviously a new concept in distance education			
Yes yes			
Uh sir ek sawal aur uthta hain ki jo baaki			
antarashtriya radio sansthaye hain 			
Jo aapne abhiyan kiya hain aur shandaar aapko safalta mili hain un			
hone isme kuchh dilchaspi prakat ki ?			
 Ye iske baareme hamne baat ki thi pichhle dino			
 Asia Basic Broadcasting Organisation ki meeting			
 hui thi Singapore mein 			
Wahan par iske upar kafi charcha hui thi aur khaas taur se jo			
vikas sheel desh hain jo uske sadsya hain unhone hamse iske baareme			
kafi material manga hain aur usse uh doosara 			
experiment jo hamne pahle kiya tha uske liye hamare paas bhi 			
 Ghana se log aaye the yaha dekh neke liye ki hum kis tarahse			
 one word kar rahe hain kaise ja rahe hain aur communal			
broadcasting uh association ki jo meeting hui			
thi usmein bhi ispar kafi charcha hui 			
Aur woh log hairat me hain ke radio can do so much 			
And uh how it is possible without the visual aids ?			
Merely if it's a stromg medium we are able to go ahead			
Well the Director General gave us a peep into the future			
What comes after the serial on human evolution ?			
See uh we are thinking on some social uh areas 			
And we are conducting some surveys to find out which are the areas			
where because without the input from the research we do not want			
 to going go ahead 			
Because we want to be very sure ke this			
particular area needs the radio has to play a role 			
And then we identify the subjects and then we work on this basis			
But our aim will be only to take up the social issues 			
Well sir thank you very much for having been with us on			
the morning show			
As uh they say more power to your lungs 			
As you do this on radio			
And we in television will be watching carefully somewhat enviously			
but we will be watching nevertheless			
Thank you very much Mr Director General for having been with us			
Our guest this morning was Shri Amritrao Shinde Director General			
of All India Radio and we have been talking to him about this spectacular			
unprecedented experiment in terms of social integrated social			
broadcasting that have been carried out by All India Radio for the first time			
 in the world 			
Hello viewers 			
Nearly all aspects of Journalism have been undergoing a			
metamorphisis in recent times 			
Wide ranging changes have gripped the media			
Some for the better			
Some for the worse 			
The glossies as they are called have come to stay 			
And even seem to be thriving 			
Uh there has been a wave of Investigative Journalism uh which			
has brought along controversies of its own			
Today we have with us Mr Dileep Padgaonkar the editor of			
 The Times Of India who will speak to us on the modern			
trends in journalism today 			
Mr Padgaonkar has a Ph D in Philosophy from Sourgone			
 Paris 			
He has been a correspondent of the Times of India			
 in Paris and has worked in several capacities 			
with the UNESCO 			
Uh today he'll dwell on the principal influences 			
a acting on journalism 			
Uh diplomacy in diplomatic actions and the polarisating within			
the media itself 			
Mr Padgaonkar apart from the technological advancements in			
what way does present day journalism differ from that in the immediate post			
independence period 			
There have been differences I think at three levels 			
clearing his throat 			
The first is that the market for the built medium has			
become very much more competitive than it was in the years immediately after			
Independence			
Yes			
And this is has brought into its			
wake coughs several trends some encouraging some not so 			
Among encouraging trends I think is the much greater 			
emphasis on the professionalism on presentation on packaging so on so			
forth clears his throat 			
The discouraging trend is of course that the very competition			
has given rise to a great deal of uh one word journalism			
sensationlism			
And I refer in particular to film journalism			
Though it is not restricted merely to film journalism			
You find much of uh this kind of personality bashing even			
in poliltical journalism			
And lately imperative journalism 			
So this is the the first uh change that I I can see			
The other change has been brought about by technology itself			
I think the uh revolution has been witnessed in the field of			
 uh print technology in particular			
The question of gathering data storing it retrieving it processing			
it and so on has made uh it possible for news papers now to have a			
cleaner look of brighter look to meet their deadlines of course there are			
 teething problem as everywhere else 			
But this is the second factor which has uh gone long way I			
think to bring about several changes in journalism			
Thirdly clears his throat it has uh also brought			
into play a degree of specialisation which you did not have in the			
immediate uh uhm years after independence			
Today you have uh journals specialised in sports in			
motoring in yatching uh in architecture and so on so forth			
And what this is meant that is a greater degree of 			
uh pluralism 			
Discipline-wise uh in the one word fashion			
and these three trends taken together is meant that today's 			
journalism is uh quite unlike anything that was witnessed by our			
parents and our grandparents 			
 Uh 			
What about the editorial content which which is 			
They had this identity ferver then you know but today they are			
tended to go towards through profit oriented 			
You know I'm not one of those who believes that what			
the parents and grandparents did evident flo 			
 flows from idealism and what is happening today is entirely 			
uh gripped by mercantilents 			
I think mercantilents were present then 			
They are present today 			
Those idealisms then and there is considerable idealism today			
I say this because I I deal with a great many uh then			
 journalists 			
I take an active interest in the training of journalism in my			
own newspaper 			
And uh then I feel that atleast in the initial years they			
aren't corroded by cynicism which you find among those who have			
 been in the business for ten or twelve years 			
Uh but where you are probably right is that the manner			
in which market forces are shaping uh the field today 			
 It's something which is which the older generation 			
is not really accustomed to 			
This is happening everywhere in all countries where you have 			
the free market and a free press			
But in our country it's relatively new 			
The fact that uh today newspaper editors are supposed to			
be conversant atleast with what market trends are being yet what the			
trends are and the area of production in the area of circulation and so			
on so forth			
It means that uh you cannot the pictures will have of the			
editor who sits in his close cabin and concentrates all day and			
produces his handling editorials			
That picture I think is part of the myth of which is uh			
 now dead and gone 			
Uh these days we've seen you've seen uh			
 a peculiar phenomenon 			
Uh industrial houses have taken a keen interest in starting a			
newspaper of their own you know 			
Uh what do you feel of it			
Yes there again you know you should take a look at the major			
uh newspapers uh in the English language			
Your faculty were always controlled by Industrial Houses			
But what happens 			
 But you had something to do with journalism			
They were not purely Industrial Houses as such			
No			
You had certain newspapers clears his throat which were			
 those only whose own sole interest was in the field of publication			
of magazines and newspapers			
You see if you take a look at the clears his throat 			
 Anand Bazar Patrika group in Calcutta or The			
Hindu group in Madras clears his throat 			
You always had some of them whose sole business was this 			
What you're probably trying to hint at is that 			
uh industrialists with interests in several industries are adding 			
newspapers to their clears his throat uh to their table sources			
Uh and then your coyright			
 With there are two reasons for it 			
It might not really be for money			
That is I can tell you that newspapers though form of uh			
profitable today then they ever were 			
Some of them atleast clears his throat 			
 It's still not the most profitable among the business			
ventures uhm in the country 			
Uh probably many of them want to gain political clout 			
by starting newspapers clears his throat 			
I have my own reservations for this			
So the powers can be misused you say			
So the powers can be used			
But I I had my own doubts about how much clout a newspaper			
must be really enjoying			
I mean you know being addressed to by the your first			
name by the power of the woman			
If that is clouting may be this 			
But if you see the manner in which the official media are			
handled my own feeling is that the shrewdest among the political lot 			
gear up doubles for what the print media writes			
So even this business of clout write is some what exaggerated			
But then this is in contradiction to the what happens to to			
 an industrialist recently he had to give up his shares in a			
particular newspaper			
Of course it does 			
But much depends also on how much that particular industry			
 industrialist is able to uh stands 			
stand off a pressure on him			
I know another industrialist who has been uh facing the			
wrath of government for the greater part of the past ten ten years			
And uh while the scoop of the particular industrialist 			
doesn't have other interests anymore clears his throat 			
The fact is he's short of the great deal of grit and comes			
to me in in defending these matters			
I think it's part of you know periodically 			
there're fashions in the in the medium and media as there's 			
fashion elsewhere			
And the current fad is that let's me let me have			
a magazine let me have a daily newspaper and so on so forth			
My own view is this will this too record will fade away fast			
To what do you attribute the plori plorify plori			
 proliferation of a glossy magazines as they call			
And uh the they're quite successful at that 			
Even though they are very few and less at times			
No they are successful because no editing			
I think ten percent now and on packaging on presentation			
use of uh colour 			
Uh this is all a part of growing competitive environment 			
and uh today you have a supplement on blazed paper 			
Uh you even have suppliments on art paper			
And I won`t be surprised if you in due course you have			
supplements uh with perfume in them uhu and may be even a			
musical note			
 Uhu 			
You mean to say a readers can be carried away by its			
 one word 			
 I think readers are in one word 			
certainly that that one little difference uh which makes it possible for			
attractive packaging to to get rid of this 			
This is of other areas if you see what happens for detergents			
or soaps or uh shampoos 			
You see that it's a really aggressive form of marketing			
The advertising uh the packaging this is really what 			
what sets 			
So newspaper has become like any other product			
I think generally you ca 			
you can say that more and more people own newspapers regard			
newspapers uh in terms of products then in terms of the public			
service 			
Uh that's things you sh should change			
naturally			
It is exactly			
But you know it's not something to be romantic it has			
to come sooner or later 			
If you feel that people are putting in their money investing 			
naturally and so on uh uhm for purely idealistic uh reasons			
then I think uh one is really not up to the mark			
Increasing you'll find that with massive investments 			
uh they there will have to be a closer			
interaction between the editorial side of a newspaper and the			
managing sides of newspaper			
Yes 			
Uh in recent times newspapers some of them uh major			
 one's atleast are being one word that either belonging			
to the opposition or which are very pro-government			
What do you have to say?			
I think the observation is			
Especially in the objectivity point of view			
Yes you your observation is is at once true and			
sad 			
Because I think some newspapers have taken it upon themselves			
 to play politics through journals 			
Like some others have sought to use newspapers for their 			
economic or business for example 			
Uh the polarisation you talk of is radio reflection of			
polarisation on the national field 			
And to that extend it is inevitable 			
But do newspapers contribute to the polarisation I feel yes alas			
they do 			
Whereas uh the functions of a newspapers I've seen are			
ready to take a stand issue by issue 			
Partly because ideological has come between we no longer have 			
the certainties of this or that ideology			
Things are from there 			
And in its place in that vacuum that has been created what you			
have clears his throat is not another ideology but self interest			
And self interest understood in an absolutely mundane 			
petty vulgar sort of it			
So that extend I think you are right there is a polarisation I			
deplore it 			
Uh I try to resist it			
But unless the country itself becomes less polarised 			
and until the country learns to accept that there is no 			
not one truth with the capital T			
But many truths which have to one word 			
Uh it is then that you can see their involvement 			
And then the involvement of the of the journalists and the			
newspapers			
Uh I deplore the fact for example the news columns are			
used more and more for partisans interests 			
I think uh the reporters ought to be allowed to write 			
exactly what they feel like			
And such comment as you want to make should be confined to the			
 editorials 			
 That's a			
 Editorials 			
But uh there has been uh as you see among 			
theorists mass media theorist say that especially in a country like			
in India which is still in a developing stage 			
There has ought to be some agency which			
takes which moulds public opinion or which guides people 			
And at times peoples might have to take the role of the opposition			
 because as you know our opposition is pretty weak in the country 			
But some people don't agree to this			
What is what is your opinion ?			
No no			
 The that you see it is it is true that you know because			
institutions have tumbleded whether it is parliament whether it is			
judiciary uh and much of their business is now readily been given			
to the press 			
Uh it's a daunting task and it doesn't 			
happen in in developed countries 			
And once you do that you got to be the saviour of the institutions			
 You've got to be promoting causes			
 You've got be doing things which earlier you 			
didn't 			
For example even ten years ago I think that the press			
reported the going on in the parliament 			
Today it's going from the parliament are determined by			
what it is the press 			
And it's a complete switch over and it's a			
dangerous switch over because the press is accountable of course 			
But certainly it is not as accountable or as immediately			
accountable or as determinately accountable as the elected			
representatives of people 			
And to try and substitute yourself in the press for them			
 can lead to all kinds of problems 			
So do you think that certain code of conduct should be 			
the immediate code of conduct because now we have a very loose			
I don't think either a rigid code or a flexible			
codes could work because partly as you rightly point out there is this			
polarisation 			
So on what basis can you have uh a two words 			
My feeling is there is very little concensus in the			
newspaper world			
For what newspaper ought to be 			
Uh all of us stood together when the definition bill was			
brought together			
We managed to beat that back 			
We also stood together when recently the Jammu and Kashmir			
Government brought a fresh bill 			
But this kind of solidarity remains very fragile 			
Uh otherwise there is uh uh clear polarisation in the			
newspaper world			
And I don't think it dissolved very easily 			
For a code of conduct even a flexible one you need a measure of			
consensus and that consensus mind you does not exist at the moment 			
Chairman sir when we go through the budget apparently			
 it will exceed to just the budget with the duties set upto			
four thousand five hundred twenty-two crores rupees capitals			
and excise and no further taxes levied 			
The Central Plan outlay have been increased by thirty-two percent			
When we show all these things and expecting our one word			
 be close by four point five percent 			
It seems to be kept bold and imaginative budget 			
But what is the real scenario of the budget we have to go			
through little bit deeper			
They are speaking thousand one hundred million man-days of the			
employment that can be created what they feel 			
But for nineteen ninety-two ninety-three when we go through			
the reality the first six months where we are able to create			
only two hundred forty-three million man-days of employment interruption			
 outside 			
That means now what we envisage to create only twenty-five			
percent of that man-days we are able to create in the last last			
year last six months of the budget year 			
I want to know from the government what infrastructure has been			
created to fulfill this year's target 			
Sir while we say that for Central plan outlay has been			
increased by thirty-two percent we must also go through with the			
subsidy issue 			
Sir according to subsidy whatever finance is assigned			
 I want to quote financial resource if I have gone to create			
the I C O if I have gone the same way as the last year the			
fertiliser subsidy alone would have gone up to rupees eleven			
thousand crores 			
Because of the action taken in the last two years the			
fertiliser subsidy could be only rupees three thousand			
five hundred crores 			
From this you can find out sir more than seven thousand five			
hundred crores has been put on the farmer's 			
shoulder already 			
When we say that the subsidy keeps speaking that subsidy is			
something wrong policy			
No what is called subsidy ?			
Subsidy is nothing but the transfer of income from one section of			
the society to another section of the society 			
Suppose for example if I tell if you want to stop the entire			
subsidy for fertilizers and if you wanted to take up all the			
concessions that what they are giving on the per tariff the electricity			
tariff 			
Then suppose the production of the agriculture comes down 			
then we may have to take the grants from the foreign countries like 			
States or European countries 			
For example what it pays about three hundred and fifty it is			
approximately I'm telling for three hundred and fifty 			
rupees what it pays to our Indian farmer the same rate we			
may have to import from the American farmers as five hundred and fifty			
 rupees 			
Two hundred rupees we have to pay more 			
Instead of that what I say is instead of paying to the American			
farmer why should not we give to our own Indian farmers 			
What is wrong in giving subsidy ?			
Sir regarding the subsidies I wanted to tell that share of			
the subsidies to the non-plan expenditure during the Seventh Plan period 			
approximately this is sixteen percent 			
Now this side share of the subsidies in the non-plan			
expenditure during this year it is reduced eight point seven percent			
They think that subsequent reduce in the subsidy they are			
actually pleasing the one word a body of the world bank 			
This is not good for the common people in the India 			
Sir regarding the interest payment I want to tell sir the			
interest payment is now forty-two percent of the total non-plan			
expenditure 			
Now it accounts forty-two percent of the total non-plan			
expenditure 			
But in the Seventh Plan average it was only twenty-seven percent			
sir 			
Then personal income tax exemption 			
The income tax exemption till nineteen eighty-one it was fifty			
 rupees fifteen thousand 			
In nineteen eighty-five it was eighteen thousand in nineteen			
ninety it was twenty-two thousand nineteen ninety-two twenty-eight			
thousand 			
Sir the nineteen eighty-one well what they say fifteen thousand			
 rupees exemption into that system sir 			
Now it is the value of that fifteen thousand rupees			
 now it is said about forty thousand rupees 			
What I wanted to emphasize through you sir in Australia			
different method is applied 			
In Australia what they did Australia one word according to			
Australian one word first they fixed the base or base amount 			
that is their triparty two words that government employers			
employees all together they have come to one conclusion and it is taken			
as a base year 			
From that base year when one's accepted exemption			
amount that every year what is actually inflation takes place in			
Australia they have according to that percentage the exempted limit			
also keep being enhanced			
Sir through you what I wanted to emphasize to the			
government of India that please atleast now you replace that nineteen			
eighty-one you please take it as a base year fifteen thousand 			
rupees 			
After that every year how much deflation takes place in India 			
so far taken in India you please translate it that this inflation 			
after hopeless that inflation it enhance the amount then it will be one			
scientific way			
Sir regarding unique system of India the investment is so far			
 it attracts the eight to eighty of one word so far			
But now it has been given up 			
Our honourable Finance Minister says we have today equal			
treatment with other financial institution we are dealing 			
But for this one gentlemen what the economy they			
have given the proper replace for that			
Objectively the Finance Minister has taken this step so as			
to put the U T I or bond with other mutual fund			
However if that was the only reason surely his left			
technical method would have been the extensive a few words 			
benefits to other mutual funds 			
Instead of taking the benefits what people are enjoying in the U T			
I they would have experienced the same benefit the other mutual funds 			
Then sir when you object actually enhance the prices 			
 You're doing not only the interest one word 			
 not only in the tax one word but the administrative			
prices			
For example I tell you before announcing the budget 			
pre-budget you can say pre-budget announcement			
You have enhanced the price for sugar 			
You have enhanced the price for actually the rice's 			
price increased 			
The actual price increased gold price increased that the			
prices of the coal prices of the sugar price of rice price of the			
 then increased automatically it all the product put on the floor			
therefore what I request the government that government should what			
they they have shown what they have printed what they have said is			
totally different from what they are doing 			
What is their real intention ?			
Therefore I wanted to I want I request you truly sir 			
that please bring in practice that the one word be the			
government 			
With these words I conclude			
Thank you 			
 One or two words 			
From the last two years we successfully withdrew money from the			
 one word 			
 A few words 			
And thereby about thirty-two thousand crores			
 of rupees has been withdrawn from the market 			
 and thirty-two thousand crores of rupees			
 has been invested in the financial market in the share			
market 			
 A few words 			
 A few words 			
Therefore within last year Shivaji when we			
proposed the budget and uh due to the a few words lot more			
concessions were announced for the industrial set-up than the capital			
market Shivaji 			
Then we we then the entire nation witnessed the goings			
 in regards to the scam scandal 			
The hopes were raised among many people including the rural			
folk to invest in the industrial sector and thereby lot more			
money has been diverted from agriculture to manufacturing sector and from			
rural area to urban area 			
I will also budget when we budget at the budget there was			
no hike in the tax component and uh additional component was not			
enhanced nor the custom duties 			
But at the same time they gave certain relief to other sectors			
And he said that everything is going to be cosy but he			
can't lend us we analyse the figures 			
Here they purposefully and calculatively transferred about thirty			
thousand crores of rupees from capital			
account to revenue account 			
And so then once money is transferred from capital account to			
revenue account all your balance expenditure will be cut and all your			
 development developmental activities will be			
affected 			
And we are witnessing in this in this country that			
every developmental activities is cancelled 			
No construction of roads no construction of bridges for			
industry and no allocation or any land allocation in this country 			
As the Finance Minister day-in and day-out he talks much about			
the so called liberalisation and the so called delicensing policy 			
But this delicensing policy is yet to touch the agricultural			
sector 			
And several manufactured goods and several consumer goods			
 includes the motor cars refrigerators as well as the one word			
 and washing machines are under the delicensing policy 			
As far as exemption is concerned than the so called delicensing			
proposal and so called liberalisation it is hardly that it is			
changing the attitude a few words in the agriculture sector 			
For example you take the example of the sugar industry 			
Then all of our industries are related to sugar industry is			
kept with the ministry of industry 			
In Andra Pradesh about ninety-two applications were received by			
the government 			
And the application was forwarded to the Union Government to			
the minister of sugar factories in Andhra Pradesh with an install			
capacity of twenty-five hundred metric tons per day and with an			
investment of not less than forty crores on each unit			
And the larger units are allowed four thousand crores			
 of investment has been pumped into circulation as far as the			
sugar-cane industry is concerned 			
Then you take the example of the dairy industry 			
When the government in their own one word they have			
given us into dairy industry also 			
So there are about six fifty people applied for to go for			
dairy industry 			
Many people like both domestic as well as the multinational			
they came forward to go for the dairy industry as there is potential			
in this country also 			
But I was made to understand that Mr Balram Jakhar he came			
in the way and he wanted to bring same other Narad 			
 through back door 			
So Mr Balram Jakhar announced through his animal husbundry			
department of the ministry of agriculture an offer by then milk			
and milk products are to the N F N F D O 			
So if anybody wants to go for dairy with an install			
capacity of more than ten thousand litres per day then entirely he has to			
get his name registered and we get registering form from the agriculture			
department 			
It is challenged in the court of law 			
So for the last two years instead of the liberalisation in the			
dairy industry two words applications are pending with the Union			
government for want of the registration with delay Ministry of			
Agriculture headed by Mr Balram Jakhar 			
I take another example 			
For example the second biggest monopoly in the world the R			
K Reynolds Company they approached this government to allow them to			
produce cigerettes in this country and they ensured the nation to 			
to the extent that they would consume about twenty-eight thousand metric			
tons of sugar metric tons of tobacco in this country 			
And not only that they ensured to export about one			
forty crores of cigarettes to the other countries			
And they also ensured that about six hundred crores			
 of revenue they will contribute in the form of excise on this			
cigerette 			
But their proposal was was also turned down 			
I visited one word to the minister of Commerce and the			
minister told me that as the deputy chairman of the planning			
commission he vetoed it 			
Since the last forty-five years this is the only year when			
there is no hike and the excise component on the Cigarette 			
But the answer to this the cigarette manufacturers in			
their own wisdom during last January February as they rotate they			
enhanced the prices of the cigarette then anticipating some enhancement			
some hike in the excise components on the cigarette in the budget			
proposal 			
But to their fortune there was no increase in the excise			
component 			
Thereby the cigarette manufacturers drawn an opportunity 			
to garner three hundred crores of rupees 			
 which did not circulate to the government in the form of the revenue 			
and nor to the tobacco grower for in the form of the price of			
the tobacco 			
Add to this two words the prices of the tobacco are			
going down when compared to the last two three years			
So we suggested to the government to impose a levy of one			
percent on the sale of the cigarette and which money which amount			
 can be utilised as a market stabilising fund for the tobacco 			
And I hope the government will come out and the Finance			
Minister will come out while answering these by answering 			
the Finance Bill and see that the one percent is imposed on the			
sale of the cigarette and that money can be utilised as a market			
stabilising fund			
So I hope that the finance minister will come out with the			
proposal while answering these fi financing			
 it			
Thank you 			
	 Prof Sarin 		
	Then now the discussion that we are having really become		
	 ritually a few words 		
	In the other house already the budget has got through 		
	that is the ruling party has won 		
	Won means inspite of their minority with their contrast		
	majority only because the total of the opposition was		
	unable to found hard on that contrast majority to break it through 		
	I just have known that one or two words be long to come		
	But let us take the fact as they are kept at the moment 		
	It is because they are still there 		
	We have discussed their budget 		
	It is their budget 		
	It is not the budget of the country 		
	It is the budget of the Congress Party 		
	But the very truly I feel with that party is this 		
	party's culture spins us around personality cult 		
	Only one speaker whether I I can agree with him or not 		
	talks on the one or two words but all others have 		
	finished their speech with one or two words and through the		
	Prime Minister and Finance minister in the bracket 		
	In that one or two words with that of one or two words		
	 during the entire speech and I think what is more		
	revealing in this house such self-analysis that		
	introspectable vioable that in this country for the last forty		
	years we have been groping in the dark through a known path 		
	And now a doctor has appeared with a magic lantern 		
	with the blessings of the Prime Minister who hails from the		
	region of Tirupathy or one or two words at least in that stage		
	Today he is a one or two words self one or two		
	words 		
	This is certain thing that party is supposed to stand before 		
	for which that they one or two words and from which they draw		
	sustenance 		
	From the name of Gandhiji from the name of Nehru from the		
	name of Sardar Patel and all other freedom fighters 		
	The Rajiv Gandhi of of whom they will now talk so much 		
	So within these forty years forty or as in free 		
	this ninety-one period 		
	So all at one or two words I don't know what will happen		
	at Amethi 		
	That is their internal affair 		
	But is such bretheren is the idealogical foundation of the		
	ruling party of the great country 		
	 That's a woe unto the total population of the country		
	It is nice to break one or two words almost by the		
	dual one or two words it has no right 		
	And now by inheriting that if demolishing it even on which		
	 on the foundation on which they stand 		
	Then the question is Mr vice chairman what for we		
	should be thankful to the new mens era 		
	Either Dr Manmohan Singh or P V Narasimha Rao if the budget		
	that has been presented what is that what that ensure 		
	That ensures that our foriegn exchange which we didn't		
	afford I M F loan or World Bank loan or A G B loan or net loan		
	through other syndicates 		
	In the history of the world perhaps such shameless 		
	acknowledgement of the building up of foriegn reserves and things like		
	that and showing it to be a strength of the economy what do we found		
	 ?		
	That these and of late our finance minister went		
	 in the one pack jumborie in order to ensure three hundred 		
	 crores of dollor one or two words for what 		
	one or two words our all one or two words 		
	And what else could he do ?		
	He went a few words policy only involved that you know 		
	Under the pressure of U S A one or two words 		
	under the threat of this super three hundred one regarding which some		
	 a few words takes place now and then 		
	In order to one or two words the Duncan proposal		
	 in order to steal ourselves for that one or two words 		
	where Duncan proposals will be finalised 		
	What you mean then ?		
	Our import duties had been reduced one or two words 		
	and services have been reduced or totally done away with in order		
	to make import from advanced countries to developed countries 		
	To capture our market to victimise of our indigenous		
	industry 		
	Therefore from whatever point of view it may be looked into		
	 it enlarge unqualified proposition and unequivocal		
	condemnation		
	I shall oppose oppose this budget tooth and nail 		
	V Narayanswamy 		
	Yes madam please		
	 one or two words honourable Finance Minister		
	 A few words but he was not using		
	While referring to the present day birth situation on		
	the economic scenario made very clear and categorical assertion in his		
	majesty which I like to put only two or three sentences to 		
	enlight your enlighten the honourable members who are on the other side		
	 A few words 		
	Madam he says the a few words very rapidly		
	 becoming more integrated at northern place and also more complicated		
	Other developing countries are successfully transforming themselves		
	 to meet these challenges 		
	We cannot afford afford to stay out of this problem which appear to		
	be awkward 		
	This a few words 		
	Therefore madam the finance minister was very clear in his mind		
	that with the with the birth the economic situation is changing 		
	changing changing rapidly 		
	Liberation is taking place even in the communist country 		
	and not only that they one or two words should become		
	competitive in the field of production of various items including the		
	infrastructure industry consumer industry and India should be in a		
	position to export to other countries various items		
	In the International field India also should become competent		
	And also competitive to get not the foriegn exchange to		
	balance our economic situation 		
	Therefore madam several liberal liberal measures for		
	 to sort out on one or two words and which has		
	been taken by the present government for the last two years 		
	But that is the the the new schemes and steps that		
	has been taken by the government for the purpose of recouping the economy		
	 that was established in the year nineteen ninety-one beginning 		
	started yielding good results 		
	 Ma Madam the balance of		
	payments position which was left at two thousand crores 		
	 by the previous government now it has come up to the level of 		
	eighty-eight thousand eight hundred to eight hundred twenty-eight 		
	crores 		
	On borrowed money 		
	No it is not borrowed money		
	The borrowed money goes to investment which which one has to		
	accept 		
	Madam it is also a fact that the the our our		
	limit of five point nine million as our foriegn exchange reserve 		
	we have not achieve		
	One has I have to admit on that point and that aspect 		
	Therefore madam the government has taken various measures 		
	for the purpose of improving the economy 		
	And the finance minister who has taken a bold decision to		
	bring reform in in the in the agriculture side 		
	Madam the thrust has been given for agriculture in the in the		
	present budget by the finance minister 		
	And the outlay for the one or two words agriculture		
	 si side has been increased 		
	considerably 		
	The reason is that madam the agriculture is the poor sector		
	 which is the vital for the purpose of development of any country		
	especially our country India 		
	Madam then the government brought liberalisation as far as the 		
	the bringing the industries in the rural areas the agro-based		
	industries 		
	The agriculture to be given all the emphasis and also		
	support by the by the budget 		
	Therefore madam that the name new agriculture policy that		
	has been proposed by the government is going to give a thrust to it 		
	and the it will pay therefore lot of agro-based industries to		
	come into this country in the rural areas for the purpose of creating 		
	employment to the rural persons who are living in this country 		
	Madam the industrial recession was there in the last year 		
	in this country 		
	And not only the industrial recession in this country it has		
	been throughout the world 		
	The both the consumer items and also the infrastructure		
	industries the production was less 		
	Even in the other country but the there is		
	recession total recession and therefore the goods could not be marketed		
	 anywhere in our country and also abroad 		
	Therefore madam some changes have been brought by this		
	government for the purpose of investment and also especially in the		
	infrastructure side so that to give boost to the infrastructure		
	industry 		
	Madam in the banking sector which I would like to say only 		
	a few lines 		
	Uh the it is a one word the nation 		
	Now several lakhs of rupees have been in		
	the security scam 		
	Several banks have been involved 		
	Several the executives of the banks have been 		
	one or two words and also some of the officers have been arrested		
	And C B I is one or two words investigating into the		
	matter and not only that our parliamentary committee is also 		
	going into the security scam 		
	Madam though it was initially felt it is about five thousand 		
	two hundred crores 		
	Madam this this security scam has only shaken the the		
	banking system in this country 		
	And that the banks have indiscriminately invested in the in		
	that say scam one word without the approval of the government		
	And also bring the one or two words and thereby		
	the finance minister has to undertake ten thousand crores		
	 for the purpose of the giving the		
	manufacturing bank 		
	Madam the honourable the minister for banking is also		
	sitting here 		
	Then who is affected today ?		
	It is the farmer who is affected 		
	It is the farm industrial products who are affected not the		
	 one or two words not the stock brokers it is only the people		
	who are genuinely working for the development of this country they are		
	affected 		
	And the loan are loans are not being given to them 		
	Even madam see when the previously when Congress government		
	there there was a scheme for the purpose of giving loan to the people		
	loans one word scheme was there 		
	And it was giving benefit to the small people agriculturist 		
	and also schedule caste and schedule tribe people 		
	And and also from labourers 		
	Today what is happening they are not in a position to go to the		
	bank they are not able to enter into the bank today 		
	The reason is that that the B J P government came here 		
	They have completely closed the door 		
	Thereafter one or two words security scam after security		
	scam the banking officials they are not allowing the agriculturists		
	to enter into the bank 		
	This is a very serious matter Mr minister 		
	The Indira Gandhi our honourable former Prime Minister has taken up		
	 Nationalisation of the bank is only for the purpose of giving benefit		
	to the poor people downtrodden schedule caste and schedule tribe		
	agriculture a few words agriculturists 		
	And madam I feel there is a one or two words method		
	In the banking division we don't one or two words 		
	people there honestly repay the amount 		
	It is the big industrialist who have siphoned out ten thousand		
	 crores of rupees who have not paid that		
	money 		
	But it is only the agriculturists who are paying the money and		
	those people a few words 		
	And not only that for only capital small-scale		
	industrialists who are who are suffering today the reason is that		
	the banks banks have completely closed down		
	They have not allowed the small scale industries also to come		
	for the working capital 		
	They say one or two words the security scam is being		
	investigated they have not received any direction from the government 		
	Therefore they will not give you the loan 		
	Therefore madam the production in the small-scale sec		
	 sector is going down 		
	Madam small scale sector is contributing twenty-two percent of the		
	export in this conutry 		
	It is not the big industry it is not the middle middle		
	industry it is only small scale industry that is contributing for		
	large export in this country that is going to be killed by the banking sector		
	 because they are not providing loans to them 		
	Therefore the honourable minister Venkatrajan minister who is		
	sitting here I request him to deal with seriously call all the		
	 bank banking officers give a direction to them 		
	Normal banking activity should start otherwise our production		
	in this country will go down 		
	And also the people who are in the agriculture sector they will be		
	suffering 		
	The another area there honourable finance minister has to		
	concentrate is black money 		
	More than eighty thousand crores of 		
	rupees is in the form of black money interruption 		
	Madam that black money has to be brought down 		
	Which should be brought out which is now hidden 		
	That is to be done various schemes have been brought then		
	they bringing fund from Madras the government will not ask the account		
	Now where was scheme that we brought ?		
	What is the total amount if you have recovered if you have		
	brought out of it ?		
	It is not even more than seven percent out of eighty		
	thousand crores not even seven percent of the money has come		
	out 		
	What is the scheme you have to bring the black money out ?		
	So that the inflation will not be there and there will be a		
	balance economy and and and the people and the budget which you have been		
	presenting in the country is imperfect 		
	Madam the only madam the novel provision is for the		
	small scale industry especially the people who are who'll		
	 be having small industry have been given the benefit and it is a		
	laudable measure that has been taken 		
	And madam in our state though it is small state having more		
	than only ten lakh population 		
	In in our town limit alone we have more than four		
	hundred small units which are manufacturing one word which		
	are to be sold one rupee and even a common man goes and		
	gets it and he is using it 		
	And there are madam it's a big lobby is working in		
	this country to curtail that industry for the simple reason that		
	these giants and multinationals they are trying to see that these		
	industries are closed 		
	Madam the the one word government has taken a		
	decision low duty duty will be imposed on this item and the turnover		
	has been increased to thirty lakhs 		
	It is a right decision has been taken by the government on the		
	representation given by those people 		
	But madam the lobby that is working the multinational who who		
	are in this country they are trying to kill those industry 		
	And madam that is giving in a small place it is giving employment		
	to more than ten thousand people 		
	The the people who are involved in the production people who		
	are involved in the marketing ten thousand people are getting the benefit		
	Not only that the people who are using it are a few words		
	Therefore madam this budget I feel that it is a growth		
	oriented budget it is a common man's budget 		
	 A) JARACHARAN M 		
	The past much sounded programme of bringing uh		
	bringing the gap between the developed and backward regions in the country		
	This budget does not hold on to the hope for		
	backward state like Assam for bringing the region at par with the		
	rest of the country		
	 One or two words 		
	Yeah every region should be considered 		
	 One or two words industry 		
	communication		
	Before three we should finish 		
	Assam and Bodo one or two words land the entire		
	north eastern region is full of untapped natural resources and		
	mineral 		
	There are no provisions in the budget to combat the		
	waste to find out for the purpose of finding out 		
	and tapping the natural resources for the beneficial 		
	benefit of the people 		
	 As to a few words 		
	 No no finance a few words your party		
	time is sixty-two minutes 		
	And bringing material welfare to them 		
	Assam is a state where eighty percent of the people live on		
	agriculture 		
	 Assam perhaps was the first state where ceiling on land		
	holding act was passed in the mid fifties 		
	 A few words 		
	The maximum amount of land which an agriculturist can hold		
	 is fifty bighas 		
	In the presence of decay and natural division of family the		
	areas in possession of farmers are diminishing making the land		
	with farmers progressively uneconomic making more and more		
	farmers marginal and landless 		
	General provision in the budget for improvement of agriculture 		
	will not help uh ah will not help the farmers of the state and special		
	provisions uh for making industrial planning has to be made		
	Special agriculture in the field in the state it is the team 		
	one or two words 		
	There are no provisions of mechanical agriculture no		
	provisions for irrigation and other two word to make agriculture		
	 one word economically viable 		
	In the field of industry my state is the most backward		
	The industries in the state has not taste its exploitative		
	character 		
	The British uh colonial exploited the natural resources in		
	the state to their best and the Indian which is that has taken over 		
	only saves exploitative assault 		
	Local enterpreneur are being discouraged in their		
	attempt to enter the field and there are one or two words		
	 incentives to them not to try healthy one or two words 		
	Industrialists operating in Assam exploit the natural wealth 		
	resources all profit take this out of the state without		
	contributing to the welfare of the people 		
	The Industries also do not help in the solution of the		
	unemployment programme as they are reluctant to employ local people		
	They one or two words for industries in the north		
	eastern region would not confirm anybody with to the people of		
	the state and the region		
	 One or two words provisions are made to encourage 		
	local entrepreneur as part of industries by offering special concession		
	and in one or two words for encouraging them to enter the		
	field 		
	There are no provisions in the budget for rehabilitation of		
	the non-employed and one or two words by starting 		
	agro-based heavy industry 		
	They are uh no provisions for meeting to the 		
	progressive unemployment programme and number of announcement being		
	in medium and it is uh increasing by last every year		
	The problem is a real one and a serious one 		
	The use of the state discoverings on are straight away		
	emerging out of uh deep sense of deprivation 		
	Large numbers of youth have taken up arms others have taken		
	recourse to extortion one word as national a few words 		
	We are going to lose an entire generation 		
	Militancy and militarian para military forces have		
	been a permanent picture in the state and large numbers of people are		
	behind the bars under TADA 		
	Development was uh kept to a standstill for years 		
	The Government has to realise that strong arm tactics is		
	not going to help 		
	There should be special provision for removal of the		
	terrorist and the development of the state and special measure to		
	ensure economic development should be started 		
	 		
	B) V M Jadhav 		
	You know and everybody knows that in June nineteen		
	ninety-one when our government has come into power that time 		
	economy was totally paralysed 		
	Unprecedent balance of payment crisis was there 		
	International confiderate has been total collapse and		
	industrial production was falling and inflation was on right thing		
	And then honourable Narasimha Rao taken up the leadership of		
	this country as a prime minister 		
	And Mr Manmohan Singh when he became the finance minister of		
	this country then whatever economically beneficial for such largest		
	populated country of the world he has sort out properly and he		
	has brought out the reforms 		
	And we are today we are getting the fruits of for 		
	those reforms 		
	Madam you know and I also know we talked on the state to state		
	You know that our Maharashtra is most agriculturally and		
	economically advance state 		
	It is not only due to Bombay 		
	We are running about one hundred and ten co- operatives sugar		
	factories more successfully 		
	We are producing forty percent of the national sugarcane 		
	We are producing the forty percent total of the national cotton 		
	and then most of the cotton mills and textile mills are concentrated in		
	Bombay 		
	And if something goes wrong in Bombay if war started somebody		
	 from Bombay so total economy will be collapsed 		
	This is the wrong policy please for the one state you adopt		
	this policy of the decentralisation of the industries to the rural and		
	economically backward areas of this country 		
	Unless you do that our countrymen our people they will		
	never excuse you either BJP will be one or two		
	words or any other party will be one or two words has no		
	meaning it is totally insignificant 		
	But the main significant thing is that then important thing is		
	that the people of this country must get equal benefit of our economic		
	policies that is the main concern 		
	That should be main concern about the country 		
	I was reading in todays one of the press about the Duncan Agreement		
	Government is going to accept the Duncan Agreement 		
	I don't know I have not fully studied the Duncan		
	Agreement 		
	But government how they discuss about the Duncan Agreement 		
	What is the Duncan Agreement ?		
	What it is going to do harm to the farmers ?		
	How it will be beneficial to the farmers ?		
	Farmers are against Madam for taxing the agriculturists but		
	the thing is that you please see first what is their economic situation 		
	How much he is getting in his farm ?		
	Or how much output he is getting ?		
	We have categorically demanded in this house this agriculture		
	commodity should be given the regulatory prices 		
	You one or two words industry you allow us to		
	increase the prices of agriculture commodity by the standard move when		
	you you you you just gather sympathy to pretend but do not hike but		
	at one at one side you are not allowing to increase the agriculture		
	 pro prices of agriculture commodity 		
	Madam about the modernisation of the industry 		
	So about the modernisation of industry much help needed 		
	But I must say that as I have stated yesterday also 		
	 wh while discussing about the NTC the		
	National Textile Corporation 		
	See modernisation process is a continous process and any		
	industry is coming out any licence is given licence are delicenced		
	but it must be made compulsory that they must have their own research		
	laboratory 		
	They must find out their own technology and they must try to		
	modernise their industry as and when required		
	That is very essential		
	Our budget should not be the deficit budget it must be the		
	surplus budget 		
	Our export must be much more greater than the import 		
	We are given several concession for the import 		
	We are giving several concession for the export also 		
	But we must do all this at the same time we must see		
	that what we are exporting 		
	And we must push the export of agriculture commodity 		
	Because in Maharashtra we are trying our level best to export the		
	mangoes to export the grapes to export the we are demanding		
	that you can give us the concession to export five to fifteen lakhs of		
	cattle milk 		
	And if we export something and we get this foreign exchange 		
	then we can give better prices to the farmers also 		
	So now the time has come we are not to think twice that 		
	we have to give this top priorities for the export of the agricultural		
	commodity 		
	Madam I did not I will not go uh in the detail but I wanted		
	to demand in this house as the discussion is going on on the budget		
	 so that special financial provisions have to be made for the 		
	development of economically backward region for Marathwada Vidarbha and		
	parts of Konkan in Maharashtra 		
	In this very house I'm in this very house we have		
	several time demanded that uh category development board should be		
	created for the backward regions of Maharashtra Marathwada Vidharba		
	and parts of Konkan 		
	Government has never agreed 		
	But at least you must make this situation higher than provision 		
	What is backlog of those region ?		
	Others is if then when you have to mention this special		
	financial assistance is given for the development of the economically		
	backward regions of this country 		
	Another important thing is that industrialisation of sugar		
	factory spinning mills food processing industries horticulture		
	development programme 		
	Whatever demands are from Maharashtra they should be solved within		
	no time 		
	Creation of proper road communication conversion of state		
	highways into national highways they are demanding this from Maharashtra		
	for the last so many years 		
	Special financial assitance for irrigation 		
	As the Krishna and Godavari valley projects are not completed 		
	If we could not complete those projects by two thousand AD our plan		
	will go and whole Maharashtra will not get any water 		
	So the special financial assistance should be given for the		
	irrigation project which are to come up in Krishna and Godavari valley 		
	And laying out a special pipeline		
	Now in this house we have this is the last discussion I am		
	taking Madam		
	The uhm while discussing the one or two words 		
	questions and some other uh items in this house I have said that I did		
	not take down the LPG pipe line which is co 		
	coming from Bombay High to the Jagdishpur and even your		
	enquiry a few words said		
	On the same line we demanded in this house that we must have		
	some a pipe line which can carry the Bombay High gas from Maharashtra		
	to southern India 		
	It must go from the Maharashtra Vidarbha Marathwada then		
	Karnataka then Andhra then Tamil Nadu so like this the several		
	pipelines which can carry the Bombay High surplus gas inspite of		
	clearing up the gas worth upto fourteen hundred crores 		
	per year		
	You please have the another pipeline and carry out the gas in the		
	southern India so that the farmers there two words 		
	So that our farmers of the southern India will be benefitted		
	With this few lines I I suppose this so one or two words 		
	and thank you very much for one word 		
	 ( 1) Inderjeet Kumar 		
	Uh our finance minister whom I respect a great deal 		
	noise but one thing on which he has not been able to persuade me to		
	agree with him that we are not ready getting into debt 		
	or we have not even now what to one word 		
	Now it would as it is if you look at the budget 		
	already you see a very interesting figure noises uh a		
	few words and uh budget came have even graphically 		
	a few words the break up of the rupee as to how		
	a rupee come and how a rupee goes 		
	And when the break up you see you find that twenty-seven		
	 paisa in a rupee go towards the debt		
	service charges 		
	Now these twenty-seven should be very telling when you realise		
	 that our defence budget which is of course more than anything		
	else is thirteen paisa in a rupee 		
	 that is your debt service charges are already more than twice of		
	your defence expenditure 		
	Now I must compliment the finance minister because his		
	persuasion in Washington always gets him more loans 		
	And since for everytime he comes back he comes back with a bag		
	full 		
	And then bagfull ultimately has to be paid 		
	We have created an impression in the country that it is a day		
	of jubilation when we get more debts 		
	As it is one word even in families when we start		
	celebrations as such 		
	When more debts are required various things just out 		
	When the truth comes home and things become very difficult		
	The learned finance minister would have seen the latest report		
	of the U N D T which I had a had a time to glance over 		
	Now the whole system of international monitory system is so		
	manipulated that the more we give the more we want 		
	You won't do it and if you look at the logic of debt trap of		
	any society that is what is happening 		
	Because devaluation is manipulated 		
	Ever since we have launched on this tryst with 		
	globalisation the Indian rupee has been constantly		
	devalued 		
	About some times formally many times and more times		
	informally 		
	And today I think if I have mentioned somewhere in my article		
	recently which is gone down by forty-two percent 		
	Uh I hope I'm saying the right figure 		
	The end result is that you find that you go on pay 		
	there is not a single country as much a few words 		
	And this is the irony of the whole thing that the more you pay		
	the more you owe 		
	And this will go on happening in our case also 		
	We will be happy for a while but I don't think we can be happy		
	 for a long time 		
	Everytime uh the new one word policy if I may 		
	quote myself in the article that I have just written the use		
	of this policy has been uh reversing many sound economic policies 		
	that we have followed in the past 		
	What was our past ?		
	Our past was primarily based on self-reliance 		
	Our past was on import substitution 		
	And for number of years following the Nehruvian outlook		
	 this society has built itself 		
	It is not as if we are a new country like any African African		
	country in dark continents 		
	We are a country who have built in last uh uhm so many years		
	after freedon to come to occupy a very respectable position so far as		
	industrialisation goes so far as our economy goes 		
	We are in a mess because of the debt that we took 		
	Who took the debts ?		
	How debts were taken ?		
	How debts were squander ?		
	I will not enter into that area because I know who did it		
	And I know on what we spent 		
	But the main difficutly is different now 		
	Let me see we make this country believe as if self-reliance and		
	 and import substitution were dirty words		
	And we must get out of that and launch launch on the new era		
	 then we go on doing this one word 		
	So therefore you see that increasingly now we are getting into		
	 more and more debts and even the experts have said by the end of the		
	eighth plan if we continue doing what we are doing our our debt		
	service charges will be approximately thirty-two percent of the revenue		
	earnings 		
	Well it is for the learned minister to decide whether that		
	will be a good day for India or that will be a day for celebration for		
	India 		
	That is for him to decide		
	I don't know I hope I will not live enough long enough to		
	see that day I don't want to see that day 		
	Because I come from that generation which participated in		
	freedom struggle 		
	I also belong that to that generation 		
	which took pride in the policies that Nehru followed 		
	And we still continue to take pride in that 		
	And if those next generation which thinks they are wiser now than		
	Nehru of course they are welcome to it 		
	I will not question their wisdom 		
	But I will also say at the same time that what we are doing 		
	needs caution and needs understanding 		
	The new budget that we have seen is gradually shrinking the		
	nations building prospects 		
	The honourable finance Minister can get up and say that well 		
	this year I have given more money for education than he gave last year 		
	That is no comparison because last year it was worst so it		
	is slightly better than the worst that is not the issue 		
	The issue basically is that everything that builds the nation		
	ultimately is shrinking 		
	And everything that doesn't build the nation is expanding 		
	So therefore this is the policy that we are following 		
	I if I get timing sir I would have spoken at length about other		
	dimensions of the of the policies that India is following 		
	My young friend Mr Minister of State for foreign affairs is		
	sitting here 		
	I would have discussed the foreign policy also and I would have		
	discussed the various things that are causing us anxiety 		
	And I think it is not him a few words but one or two		
	points I want to make 		
	And one point basically is about the Kashmir today 		
	I think this is something which you must think over is		
	everything happening there alright 		
	Have we not reached a stage when I think as a nation not as a		
	party whether we sit on that side or this side 		
	As a nation we have to sit up and uh see what we can do		
	Look at the entire situation sir that police was involved 		
	The para military sector of police which have gone out there		
	some times cause us anxiety 		
	And the Prime Minister of India does not think it good enough 		
	to call even a meeting of the All Party to discuss this Kashmir		
	situation 		
	Kashmir has been one word from one situation to		
	another 		
	And if there is any area where we should be axious today I		
	think something has to be done 		
	A few days ago I have mentioned also about I O C conference		
	Unfortunately yesterday I was out of town so I could not come to		
	the constituency committee meeting 		
	But what I see from the reporting I I spoke to the government		
	of India on that 		
	I think the policy that we are following regarding I O C needs		
	to be to be redoubled 		
	I think I O C is a platform which is converting itself into		
	a into sort of a follow on organisation of what Pakistan says 		
	We have several countries in the one word Organisation who		
	are very friendly to us most of them who are they 		
	And I think that is uh we should definitely who		
	are they Pardon who are they 		
	Oh I beg your pardon		
	I I beg you pardon		
	I accept that but mean the same thing a few words		
	 		
	Uh whether you put organisation first or Islam first it doesn't		
	make much difference 		
	It is so typical to us 		
	It comes to the same thing 		
	The main point that I am trying to say is that in recent time		
	and I hope my young friend will kindly help us in that and help		
	the country in that 		
	That redoubling of the effort is very much called for 		
	And I think on a on a bilateral basis particularly we		
	must make these friends feel and rewrite that friendship in India has		
	always been very profitable and will continue to be profitable for each		
	one of them 		
	Be the Africa be the Asia or be the Arab world 		
	 India's history has been that in every crisis of this		
	region India has upheld their cause 		
	I think it's not that India's got in danger today		
	I don't see so 		
	But definitely they their diplomacies must see through the		
	type of propaganda that we are being subjected to 		
	And I think that is where our wh 		
	whole effort has to be concentrated on 		
	 Already 		
	 A few words 		
	 Who are they 		
	 Who are they 		
	 Who are they 		
	 A few words 		
	 		
	( 2) Manmohan Singh 		
	Sir I am very grateful to all the honourable members 		
	who have taken part in this debate on the budget for nineteen		
	 ninety-three ninety-four 		
	As I scan through the record of the debate I could		
	 defer a couple of issues which have educated the mind		
	 of the members 		
	And I thought the best use I can make of this reply to the		
	debate is to clarify some of those issues 		
	I sincerely believe that many of these issues which		
	have been raised in the debate they are taken care of adequately in		
	the budget that I presented in one word 		
	Before I reply to the various points that have been raised in		
	the debate I would like madam to draw the attention of this august		
	house to the basic objectives of the budget as outlined in my		
	budget speech 		
	I will state six basic objectives 		
	The first one to bring about a greater sense of fiscal		
	deficit and to that extent and fiscal deficit has to be reduced 		
	Two the rooms for many facilities made possible by		
	insistance consolidation of last twenty-two months has to be used to step		
	up investments and expenditure particularly on anti-poverty 		
	programmes and on social services 		
	Three we should plan for a strong industrial recovery in		
	ninety-three ninety-four leading to a great boom in succeeding years		
	of the Eighth Five year plan 		
	Four we must set the pace with steps to form towards a		
	simpler tax system with moderate rate and greater purpose on		
	voluntary complaint 		
	Five full force must be given to agriculture agro		
	pertaining activities because agriculture after all is the foundation of		
	our economic growth 		
	Six we must devise a policy in one which gives export		
	 the highest possible emphasis making it truly international		
	endeavour 		
	It is against this background that I would like this house 		
	to judge whether the budget meets the challenge uh of the time or not		
	As I mentioned Madam there has been concern about		
	inflation 		
	I heard the concern of the members of this house with		
	regards to inflation 		
	But we must also look at the improvement that has come about 		
	in the inflation situation 		
	Mr Balanandan referred to various statistics 		
	I don't want to go into various statistical squibble but I		
	challenge everybody that by any yardstick whether if you mention the		
	average rate of inflation or twice the rate of inflation whether you		
	mention the whether you take the consumers' price index for		
	industrial workers or consumers price index for agricultural workers or		
	wholesale price index on every considerable index in this last year		
	 there has been a distinct very credible improvement on the inflation		
	front 		
	We are today on a point to point basis with inflation rate		
	of no more than six point four percent which is a trend rate of growth		
	 if you look at the past forty years of Indian economy 		
	I am not satisfied with this performance 		
	I believe in the next two years India must gain hike		
	Today the rest of the world uh do does not tolerate an		
	inflation rate of more than three to four percent		
	You must therefore have the ambition to bring our inflation		
	rate further down and that means there must be greater fiscal		
	discipline 		
	We must press ahead with the task of fiscal consolidation and		
	this year fiscal deficit will be about four point seven percent of G D P 		
	Next year we must reduce it to four or even below 		
	That is the only way we can bring down inflation 		
	The experience of last one year clearly brings out two things		
	First of all if you want to control inflation we must have		
	a strong sense of fiscal discipline 		
	Second the supplying side of the economy must be well		
	managed 		
	And last year we clearly saw despite administering one		
	word and prices of fertilisers despite increasing in prices of 		
	one word commodities and steel and coal and petroleum products		
	inflation rate was brought down 		
	And that brings infact to the supreme necessity of keeping		
	the fiscal system in good shape 		
	The Central government has made the sincere effort in the		
	last twenty-two months to bring the fiscal house in order 		
	I I urge that the State government need to do the same		
	thing because there are today in the state sector several public		
	sector enterprises particularly state Electricity Board state Road		
	Transport Corporation Irrigation Department which are a next burden		
	on the exchequer of the state 		
	Several honourable members referred to a need to increase		
	investment in agriculture 		
	I hear that concern but agriculture basically is a state		
	subject and you cannot increase investment in agriculture if state		
	finances remain in such shambles as they are		
	If we lose roughly six thousand crores on		
	electricity generation in our country the national goal is a minimum		
	rate of return of three percent on fixed investment in the power sector		
	But as again three percent goes last year we had		
	combined rate of return in the country was a negative figure of over		
	twenty-one percent 		
	Launches of state electricity board amount to six thousand		
	 crores per annum		
	We need power 		
	Without power there can be no meaningful economic development		
	And yet how is this country going to find the sources for		
	the generation of power if the power sector is being sore on it		
	And to have year after year losses as high as six thousand		
	 crores per annum		
	So I urge members honourable members that we must evolve a		
	viable national consensus for sound fiscal management of our economy 		
Question number one twenty-one ( c) M V V S Murthy 			
 Shri Murthy please 			
 Shri Bolabuli Ramaiah ( a) When the			
government have signed any contracts with the private companies for			
development of small oil and gas fields 			
( b) If so the details there of 			
( c) Whether the process of privatisation of hydro-carbon sector			
has been considered 			
( d) If so the contracts being initiated at present and			
( e) The total contracts signed between the government and			
private sector 			
First ( a) to ( e) the statement is laid on the table of			
the house sir 			
Speaker sir I would like to know from the honourable			
minister when the government is supposed to open all those areas			
which are exposition for not early one word open to the security			
reasons 			
If so how many such are likely to be opened at the earliest			
area ?			
And another thing I would like to know the wealth which have			
been not properly or defeated whether they are able to plan any 			
new systems that will enable to increase the fertility in order to			
increase the requirements of the crude in this country 			
The honourable minister has made a statement saying within three			
years they have increased to upto sixty percent of the last 			
 pre previous production 			
And I would like to know how you will able to achieve that results			
 and if you can be able to give some information I would be			
happy 			
The security clearance is required for opening up uh			
 the areas			
Before that uh we have to get the security uh clearance			
required			
And normally after we get the security clearance those areas are			
opened up for either explanation or production 			
Specially where they are outside investors foreign			
companies involved 			
Uh the second part of the question uh uh on what steps are			
being taken to enhance the production 			
Sir there are various steps which are being undertaken right			
from Bombay High which is the largest field there is a what you			
call the E O R uh enhance oil recovery uh proposal which is being			
evaluated			
There are five companies who have uh bid for this proposal			
 which will improve our production from the Bombay High that			
is being considered because there will be substantial improvement from			
the existing 			
Besides that also of other fields we are looking at uh			
geo-techniques and other technology to come in 			
Like the horizontal drilling in all other method to see how we			
can augment the all production 			
And as far as the third third part of the question is concerned			
the sixty percent production rise 			
Yes sir they are very much in place 			
This year the production is going up by five million tonnes 			
that means from the lower of twenty-seven millions last year 			
This year the production goes upto thirty-two next year			
thirty-eight and in the year ninety-seven I am glad to inform the			
house the oil production in the country will go upto forty-four point			
five sir 			
 That's what the situation is 			
Speaker sir as per the Eighth plan what the			
honourable minister says it should go upto forty-four point four five million			
 and if we achieve those it will be happy 			
But whether they are going to do all the things within our own			
country or in the boundaries of surrounding countries also where it is			
possible ?			
Whether the O N G C's make any new survey in Andra			
Pradesh Tamil Nadu Kerala and Gujarat for new areas for new			
development ?			
Whether they are able to make in order to as 			
 requirements are going up			
By two thousand years what is the total demand ?			
How much we have to import ?			
How much you can produce within the country ?			
And other important item is the driving technicians which			
is required in this country are terribly shortage and we are depending			
more from outside 			
Whether we will have a training school that we can develop them			
within the country I would like to know from the honourable minister ?			
Sir the strategy for oil explosion explosion in			
production is to get India its share in the global oil			
That means India must have its equity in the global oil 			
Hence we are looking for oil within the country and outside			
the country 			
We are going to be exploring and getting trying to explore			
opportunities for producing oil outside 			
Vietnam is the classical example where O N G C videsh			
 started looking for oil in the Vietnam borders 			
And I am glad to inform the honourable members that in Vietnam			
we have found gas natural gas			
The commercial study is right now under way 			
Similarly we have taken a block in Egypt 			
We are negotiating with Yemen 			
And there are various other places we are seeing besides			
looking for oil and gas within the country 			
So that we don't miss the bus 			
All this company this is a global phenomenon 			
You look at all the majors whether it is British petroleum 			
British gas all the major one word in the world 			
They are not only looking in their territory they are also looking			
globally 			
So the idea is India should be self-sufficient in oil and			
gas in the quickest quickest possible time frame and that is the strategy			
we are following 			
Regarding the survey in Andra Pradesh other areas has not			
made any reply sir			
Thank you very much 			
V K Bhat 			
A new O N G C has found a struck a new biggest field			
in Terambulam village in the Ramnagaram district of south southern Tamil			
Nadu 			
If so will the ministry beg the O N G C to drill more			
wells so that the gas field could be consolidated sir			
Sir I would like to convey to the honourable members in			
the house that wherever and whenever we find presence of hydrocarbon			
 whether it is in the form of gas or crude the logical next step is			
 more wells are drilled to de-alianate the fields to find out what			
is the quantity of the gas and oil which is there			
So that process definitely wherever it happens it is 			
automatically that project is taken up more wells are drilled			
Only then we come to a conclusion as to what is the size of the			
reservoir what is the size of the one word reserves we have			
So that will be worked again a few words 			
Sir is this a fact that Terambulam has been has been cut			
short			
Mr Rao please 			
Mr Speaker sir though taking the involving the			
foreign companies in the oil exploratiion is unavoidable to some			
extent I would like to know from the honourable minister in view of			
the fact that O N G C have invested and spend thousands of crores			
 of rupees and after great great deal of efforts 			
after very long years some oil fields and gas fields have been identified			
My question to the honourable minister is why not the			
government of India his ministry to allocate new fields which are not			
yet explored to the foreign companies and take up oil exploration and			
drilling operations by O N G C and our Indian oil companies ?			
Various companies are there and by giving issuing shares			
to the public and raising one word into the ratio in the			
ratio of one is to four definitely the O N G C and other oil companies			
 will be in a position to explore the oil which has been formed with our			
efforts and kindly one word why not the government reconsider			
its special policy offer giving on platter to this M L C's the			
precious oil resources and confine only to the new fields which are yet			
unexplored			
I would like to have a categorical answer from the honourable			
minister 			
Sir I think the honourable member is referring to the			
discovered oil fields which were found out to the Indian and			
international companies in the past 			
Sir I would like to convey to the honourable member 			
that when this decision was taken which was in ninety-two our foreign			
exchange reserves our foreign exchange the resource crunch was so severe			
 that we had some of these fields which we had found which we had			
discovered ten to twelve years ago			
So for years they were lying dormant oil was in place but			
they were not being exploited because of the resource crunch on one hand			
and the other that O N G C was fully committed with whatever funds and			
 one word it had			
For other which they considered more important projects 			
So to bring the oil on stream in the earliest possible time			
frame because of the severe oil crunch with which 			
 the country was facing			
To save the foreign exchange on the import bill we decided			
to give some of these fields after ensuring that ( a) O N G C is 			
one word to the partner to the extent of forty percent ( b) that we			
get the right technology that the production costs are lower than even			
what O N G C uh would have spent			
So after taking all these factors into consideration we			
negotiated in the best interest of O N G C and country sir 			
But we have to purchase at international market prices 			
It still comes to uh commercially speaking uh to give			
an idea a uh that for a given field where the O N G C is a			
partner like the Panno Mukhta Tapti Rava the kind of			
investments which were required then or even now when they start			
operating the fields is over a billion dollars and what are we giving			
them 			
We are giving them in a range of only ten percent to eighteen			
percent that they return			
The rest ninety percent in some cases a little less than			
 the other cases is all coming back to the company in the country			
So it is in the best interest sir			
India is not the only country which is doing it			
This is being done as a regular programme in Argentina in			
Russia in China all over 			
 It's a part of the thing to attract these companies who			
will get into this crude oil fields and then going to as you are saying			
the future exploration project and it has already happened 			
Some of these companies like Enron and Kaman petroleum and			
Indian companies like Videocon or uh uh the Reliance they have moved			
now from the discovered all these programmes and they are investing into			
exploration which is the key area reserve exploration is the biggest			
challenge from within the country			
We have to have domestic company we have to have international			
companies 			
This the discovered oil fields is very limited its only five			
percent of the total reserve 			
What is more important is to get this investment into extension			
area so that we can find new oil for the country			
Another Bombay High reserve efficience goes up that's 			
the biggest challenge for the country and this will bring bring about			
this			
Mr Shahabuddin 			
Mr Speaker sir in his reply the honourable minister 			
has referred to fourteen fields 			
Now if I recall sir in the seven international rounds			
of bids that we had offered I believe that around fifty or sixty 			
different blocks or fields are involved 			
Now I would like to know from the honourable minister the			
reason for the delay in response in respect of the large			
number of blocks that we had offered ?			
And for this the minister has not told anything 			
And secondly I would like to know he has said that the first			
five fields are going under a production sharing uh contract 			
But about the other eight more small fields he has not			
mentioned the type of contract 			
So I would like to know whether that is also in the nature of			
production sharing agreement or not merely a service contract 			
So first is the un the fields that we have offered to which			
we have received no response and the reason therefore 			
And then these fields that have been now put under contract are			
going to come on a stream 			
Sir the honourable member referred to the fifth fifth			
round and the sixth round that was the continuous continuous round of			
bidding for explanation 			
The subject matter which is being discussed right now does not			
relate to explanation is mainly focused on discovered oil fields 			
As far as the other the second part of the question which			
refers to the small fields and the type of contract we have got into 			
For the small fields unlike the discovered oil fields where I			
said that the discovered oil oil fields five fields the investment is over a			
billion dollars 			
Here the small fields are so small that they are actually not			
economically viable for a company like O N G C and one word to			
handle that's why they were bound out and we have Gujarat uh uh 			
Government Company Public Sector Company and some other companies which			
have got to gather on their own 			
In these small fields unlike the medium size fields 			
here there is no joint sharing			
These are very small uh the risk will be taken uh by those			
companies who will be producing the small amounts of gas and uh uh			
crude wherever it is in the small small one word 			
See it's not a joint venture unlike the medium 			
size fields which are mention which are joint ventures where O N G C and			
the other companies are partners 			
Question number one forty-three Shri Chitto			
Basu 			
( a) Whether exports are expected to register a twenty percent			
growth rate during the current year ?			
( b) Whether exports growth rate has declined below the targeted			
growth rate during the current financial year ?			
( c) If so the details of monthly growth legal rates of export			
during the current year in comparison to the corresponding period for the			
last year 			
( d) The reasons for poor growth rate of exports and ( e) 			
the steps taken to remedy the situation 			
Sir question one four three the statement is laid on the			
table of the house 			
Sir uh from the statement it appears uh that there			
has been wide fluctuations in the percentage growth rate of exports			
 uh during the months April ninety-four to August ninety uh			
August ninety-four 			
Sir it was uh sometimes it declined to six percent in			
August uh not in July it declined to six percent and the next			
month it shoot up or it rose to twenty-four point six percent 			
Sir it to me this phenomenon seems to be unusual			
 and that also indicates that there has been some fundamentally			
wrong and defective method in in this uh in the effort of the			
governemnt to step up the exports 			
May I know from the honourable minister what are those			
fundamentally wrong and defective uh uh defects in the system ?			
Uh if those systems have been id uh this if those			
wrong fundamentally wrong defects have been identified and if identified			
growth in the export in the month of April 			
April it was twelve percent uhn 			
May June July these three months it was single digit 			
And thereafter it has started picking up August September and			
October it has been more than twenty-four twenty-five twenty-seven			
percent one or two words if you compare with			
the figure of ninety-two ninety-three and this ninety-three recording			
broken 			
 Uhn 			
 One or two words 			
Two twenty-nine percent plans 			
Therefore sometimes it happens 			
One of the reason why it happen during this time mainly			
because the engineering exports where one incentive scheme was			
available to them we replaced it because the GATT subsidy which they			
wish to have to meet the differences between the international			
price and domestic price that was withdrawn from first of April 			
So it had some impact and the contribution of engineering 			
goods to the overall market is about twelve percent 			
Because of local levy our rice became less			
competitive			
So the agricultural product particularly rice that also uh			
rice export came down 			
Because of shortage of cotton we had to reduce the exports of			
cotton 			
Therefore there has been some reasons one word analysis we			
are making 			
But corn case also it happened like that 			
Therefore I do hope that at the end of the year 			
there could be two one word if I take the average of the first			
seven months the exports goods may not be fourteen fifteen percent 			
But in this range from the August onwards it continues and			
one good point that impact of plague which was thought that it would have			
some adverse impact but from the figure of September October it indicates			
that it is not so 			
So if this trend continues then we may end with eighteen			
nineteen percent growth			
But there is nothing basically fundamentally wrong in the			
system			
Sir may I know from the honourable minister whether 			
one or two words whether it is a fact that the government of late			
has decided to slash down the export target for the year 			
May I also further know from the honourable minister uh if not			
 what is the target for the current year and uh whether it is			
also a fact that uh the uh the tariff was on other forms of			
resistances are being increased in our tradition of export market 			
particularly in the United States of America 			
If that is so how does the government propose to remedy that and			
attain the target for the current year ?			
Sir so far the target is concerned it is for the period of			
the full five years that is to co-terminate with the one word 			
From ninety-two ninety-seven the target was fixed in terms of			
percentage that thirteen point six percent should be the enhancement			
of export in volume terms in US dollar terms it should be around fifteen to			
twenty percent 			
And in absolute terms at the end of the terminal year our			
exports should be thirty-three point five billion US dollar at the price			
level of ninety-one ninety-two 			
In order to achieve that target first year we could not reach 			
ninety-two ninety-three our performance was little more than eighteen billion			
US dollars 			
Ninety-three ninety-four it is about twenty-two billion US			
dollars 			
Therefore informally I suggested that if we could reach a			
target of twenty-five twenty-six billion US dollars in the year			
ninety-four ninety-five			
Perhaps with fifteen twenty percent step up we may reach the			
target at the terminal year of the 8th plan thirty-three point five			
billion 			
That is the target we have			
In regard to the question of having some uh restrictions of			
export of some of the Indian products to US market one item is 			
one word 			
They have raised some issues which we are contesting but in			
the first five months the overall trade of our exports to USA is			
encouraging			
There has been of the total share of US market in our			
total exports upto April to October is about twenty-two percent 			
Question number one forty-four 			
( a) The number of proposals received and cleared during			
nineteen ninety-three ninety-four for direct foreign investment in India			
( b) The terms and conditions for the foreign investment 			
( c) Whether foreign investment proposals have the potential of			
export earnings and ( d) If so the anticipated export earnings from			
foreign investment during the current five year plan 			
( a) and ( b) during the calender year nineteen ninety-three			
and the first ten months of nineteen ninety-four upto October one			
thousand six hundred and fifty proposals for foreign direct investment have			
been received and cleared and receiving foreign direct investment of			
 rupees nineteen thousand six hundred and four point 			
three six crores 			
Proposals are cleared in terms of the new industrial policy			
nineteen ninety-one 			
( c) and ( d) sir yes sir however the date on amount of export			
earnings anticipated from these projects is not centrally maintained 			
Mr Speaker sir I have specica 			
specifically asked for the terms and conditions 			
The minister has given a short reply that there are for			
the industrial policy of nineteen ninety-one 			
Speaker sir it is good sign that about twenty			
thousand crores of foreign investment is coming in one			
year 			
But at the si same time it			
appears that there are bad side effects also because this			
industry this investment there is a tendency to cluster around			
 the metropolitan cities 			
And because of that if we take the example of Bombay			
itself the prices of local flats have increased from eight			
hundred per square feet to five thousand rupees per			
square feet because of foreign investors and foreign people coming			
It is for their executives 			
On the one hand and on the other hand because of lot 			
 of lot of labour employment there will be growth of uh 			
 zhuggis 			
 What is your question Mr ?			
Sir I would like to know from the honourable minister 			
whether this foreign investors are being encouraged are being asked to			
 set up their industries in the newly uh decided growth			
centres of countries which are in remote areas 			
So what is the incentive being given to them and what 			
is are the guidelines for that ?			
Mr Speaker sir in one word industrial policy 			
statement of July nineteen ninety-one government had explicitly stated			
 that environmental protection measures will be taken to ensure			
that there is no concentration of industries in the metropolitan cities			
And that Act is kept in view while sanctioning approval 			
So I cannot agree with this opposition that Bombay is uh			
suffering because too much of invest foreign direct investment			
is coming it is certainly true that Bombay's attractiveness as a			
financial centre has increased			
That certainly has put pressure on land prices 			
I think there is a way to deal with that			
We have existing uh restrictions uh on land transactions			
which in my view I think are having bad adverse effects			
Well the answer to that is not that we should uh prevent the			
growth of Bombay as one of the worlds' leading financial centre 			
Mr Speaker sir I had also asked about the quantum of			
 export earnings that may be obtained after the full			
investement 			
But it has been answered that such data is not being			
maintained 			
My specific query was because there is a general apprehension			
 that the foreign investors are coming to invest in India 			
looking mainly towards the local domestic market and that's			
 why after the domestic market is flooded with uh the			
industrial goods of the for foreign 			
investors the local industries will also suffer 			
That is the apprehension and that's why what measures			
are being taken I would like to know for uh keeping this foreign			
investors in line with others and for asking them to export certain			
 quota of goods produced in their industry			
Sir eighty percents of the approvals of foreign direct			
investment since the introduction of the new policy uptil October			
nineteen ninety-four have been in the priority sector which are			
 mentioned in the annexe three of the industrial policy statement of July			
 ninety-one 			
These apparel oil refineries electronics chemical			
and food processing telecommunication transportation industrial			
 machinery			
So the assumption that large segment of this investment is			
going to consumer goods or nonessential goods is simply not correct			
Even where in certain cases we ha 			
have allowed uh foreign investement in consumer goods 			
We have ensured that there will be an obligation on the part of			
those investors to ensure that their export earnings will match 			
the dividends outflow for the period of one word 			
Also I would uh further like to mention it is not			
possible to uh mention or to calculate at this stage what will be 			
the foreign ex foreign exchange earnings 			
I preside over the empowered committee 			
My own feeling is that is very large part of proposals			
are directly export oriented and in years to come you will see the			
beneficial effects of this on the countries exports			
Even in terms of employment uh here of course I am			
mentioning all the industrial enterpreneurs memoranda 			
This includes the foreign investors and domestic investors 			
filed with the secretariat of industrial approvals uptil August nineteen 			
uh uptil Sep October nineteen ninety-four 			
They show that the total planned investment is three 			
lakhs twenty-five thousand five hundred eighty crores			
 			
And when these projects are completed there would be a minimum			
addition of over three million jobs to the manufacturing sector			
So the assumption that these investments are going to take away			
jobs is not correct			
In fact they are going to add to the amount of employment in			
 Indias' manufacturing sector 			
Sir I am grateful to you because you have allowed me sir			
This is a very important question and according to government			
new industrial policy one thousand six hundred and fifty uh proposal have			
been received and cleared directly from the Central government 			
Sir may I know from the honourable minister minister has			
admitted that there are some regional imbalances 			
Sir specially for the Eastern region sir the Bihar Orissa West			
Bengal and other parts of the country where the foreign investment flow			
is very poor 			
Will the minister see the matter seriously so that the N R I			
can ivest more and more money			
This is uh this is replied to sir just two			
minutes back			
 Sir 			
Sir sir Bihar Orrissa and West Bengal whether the minister			
will take up the matter with the State government and the foreign			
investors so that they can invest more and more money and specially I			
will ask for the Agro-based industry sir 			
Yes will you persuade the State government one word			
 			
Sir I interact with the honourable chief ministers of many			
states 			
I find today uh there is much greater awareness among the State			
governments to create the requisite climate in which investments will			
flow and I believe for examples uh take the case of the West Bengal			
 itself			
West Bengal has put out an industrial policy statement which I			
think is a forward looking documents			
Today I think West Bengal is aggressively seeking foreign			
investment			
Honourable Somnath Chatterjee is not here			
He had been to Australia he had been to Singapore and when			
he was asked the questions about the new industrial policy he had stated			
this is a a few words noise 			
Mr Finance Minister Mr finance minister your your			
praise of his should not create problem for this house noise 			
a few words 			
Yes Mr Chavan 			
 Aap sunlein to pata chal jata hai 			
Mr Speaker sir			
 Is ka jawab mil gaya 			
The foreign investors commercial board has cleared sixteen			
fifty proposals with twenty thousands co-investments 			
But sir I complaint that very few projects have started			
functioning and there are no ground taking ceremonies 			
The foreign investors are complaining that there is still too			
much of red tape 			
I would like to ask the minister if there is a machinery			
within the government to monitor the progress of these units 			
Sir the honourable member is right there have been gap in			
monitoring but in the last few months we have ensured that the			
secretariat of industrial approval in the ministry of industry will			
monitor these proposals 			
With regards to the actual in flow as against the approval 			
which my colleague had mentioned in the last three and a half years			
the actual disbursement has exceeded five thousand crores			
So it is not entirely correct that these proposals are being			
implemented 			
Total amount of disbursement as of now as a proportion of			
approval are about twenty-three percent which is not bad considering			
that this policy has been in operations only for nearly three years			
Question hour is over 			
	 Dr Vasant Pawar 		
	Emerging optimism and this optimism is basically		
	because of the policies of the government 		
	A response by the people of our country 		
	The Indian community has a great sense of patriotism and tolerance		
	 and we have to struggle hard 		
	Our late prime minister our leader Smt 		
	Indiraji Gandhi has said I quote strength never comes from		
	the comfort of smooth path but from the most sterness of the efforts		
	 unquote 		
	Honourable President in his address there are sixth state situation		
	in Jammu and Kashmir I think		
	That is quite sufficient a warning to the Pakistan and the 		
	United States of America not to fear interfere in the		
	matters of Jammu and Kashmir 		
	And not to teach us the human rights 		
	It is that I must say that a minor national minorities		
	finance development corporation has been set up and five hundred 		
	crores are kept for the development of minorities 		
	And a new Wakf Bill nineteen ninety-three		
	will definitely help in deciding the matters of wakf 		
	With this the development of the poor by way of 		
	 Jawahar Rozgar Yojna for I R D P employment		
	assurance scheme Mahila Samrudhi Yojna 		
	Safai Karmacharya they are the main milestones in		
	the development of our poor and down-trodden people 		
	Let us be proud of all the men and women who are doing their best		
	in building our nation 		
	We are approaching twenty-first century and twenty-first		
	century will be of the honesty the integrity the accountability the		
	productivity and the quality also 		
	And we intend to pursue all our efforts to produce more oil 		
	more electricity more fertilisers more foodgrains and more of the		
	basic needs of our people 		
	Our government and our political system are strong enough 		
	technologically and otherwise not to allow our self- reliance to be		
	mortgaged outside by an outside funds 		
	So friends we must come together we should march ahead for the		
	self-reliance 		
	We should call little operation forward faster and forward 		
	Shri Pawan Kumar Bansal 		
	Sir in an ambience of widely present chaos and		
	lack of self-confidence that permeated the national thought when the		
	present government took over the responsibility 		
	It was a doubting task particularly as a minority government		
	 to rebuild brick by brick in situations that least settled		
	Rejuvenate the economy that was in a shamble and regain		
	 practice in the comedy of nations that was its lowest at		
	its lowest ebb then 		
	In June nineteen ninety-one there was a frightening question		
	mark mocking at us about the future of India 		
	A resolute endeavour was steadly transforming that into a ray		
	of hope when suddenly a cataclysmic event on sixth of December		
	nineteen ninety-two threw the nation in the throes of 		
	communal two words 		
	With the fall of the mosque dangers of equating democracy		
	 with the tyranny of group ascerting or claiming to act on behalf of		
	the majority religious communities became real 		
	This cast a telling impacts not only on India's 		
	honour but also our economy 		
	Clouds of uncertainity started hovering for the economic		
	reforms initiated one word by the present government 		
	The foreign investors grew doubtful about the disability		
	 of investing in a country which was in the whirlpool of 		
	communal unrest 		
	It was with this uncertain and unpleasant prospect		
	 that we entered the year under review 		
	The deliberate and concerted effect from forces from within		
	and across the borders to destabilise the country only strengthen		
	the resolve of the prime minister to fight that with greater vigour		
	The people also extended support in ample measure 		
	Sir today with Congress attaining		
	majority in this house these reckless moves which we have witnessed		
	over the last two and a half years and which gave a friend on the		
	other side some false hopes have been given a fitting burial 		
	And the subsequent event has started getting results 		
	The prime minister's recent visit to Germany and		
	about the Switzerland was a resounding success 		
	With the brightening up of the investment climate in our		
	country offers for economic tie-up are pouring in faster than never		
	before 		
	The government on its part has made it a two words 		
	 but the changes under way do not and will not tinkle with the		
	basic postulates of a mixed economy and that none in the country 		
	would be adversely affected thereby noise 		
	Fears and strength on behalf of the workers a few		
	words two words seem to be only stimulated for		
	critical purposes 		
	All ventures are rather intended to create greater 		
	opportunities for the people to improve their living conditions 		
	Sir a natural outcome of the sober and mature leadership		
	provided to the country by Shri P V Narasimha Rao has dealt that our		
	stock has risen in the international community 		
	A position that Kashmir is an integral part of India is		
	once again appreciated by a very large number of countries and 		
	Pakistans' efforts to rake up the matter in the international meet		
	 have been tactfully one word and defeaed 		
	So the president has unequivocally expressed the feeling of		
	the issue as also a determination to safeguard the integrity of		
	the nation and our preparedness to meet two words 		
	When we take over we at the same time do wish to express a		
	feeling of most cordial relations with the people of Pakistan with		
	whom we have much in common 		
	We hold our ground firmly on issues like Kashmir non-		
	proliferation treaty as a need to face the United Nation Security		
	Council 		
	Terrorism and tenets of the factionalism has been met		
	remarkably in Punjab and the government is determined to fight it		
	 resolutely in any part of the country 		
	Donning the robes of a prosecutor Shri Jaswant Singhji		
	 charged the government and he was uncredible using the word charge		
	again and again sir 		
	He charged the government for not raising Hazrat Bal shrine so		
	that the tact and patience with which the government dealt with the		
	issue has been applauded all over the world 		
	And who can deny the perceptible improvement in the situation		
	thereafter 		
	Sir but it causes agony to our friend there because it has		
	deprived them of an opportunity to bake the political cake		
	 on the fire of communal frenzy 		
	Sir we have today charted a boat which would intends		
	to take India to the forefront of international community 		
	And our confidence our faith in doing so eminent from our		
	 one word to change with continuity 		
	We are proud of our past and have duplicit faith in the future		
	We believe in honouring difference of opinion 		
	We believe that national issues should be addressed to		
	 in a spirit of understanding and co-operation 		
	Sir if it is narrow political considerations which		
	dominate our thinking on every score I am afraid certain goals which		
	we wish to achieve may not become unachievable but our struggle		
	in achieving those would become a little adverse one and if it becomes		
	adverse the government headed by Shri Narasimha Raoji		
	 would remain undeterred 		
	He would remain unflinching in his determination to achieve		
	those goals 		
	 A few words 		
	Indrajit Gupta 		
	We were discussing the budget just now 		
	With the great uh uh incentives which have been provided		
	by the finance minister for the uh unrestricted growth of of the		
	private sector both domestic private sector as well as foreign investors		
	I am afraid this growth of black money will be further		
	accelerated leading to more and more corruption 		
	This is a sort of encouragement to what we should call financial		
	criminality 		
	Corruption is too mild term 		
	In some countries it is referred to it as financial criminality 		
	That is what is being fostered now in our country 		
	The President's address madam has consciously 		
	consciously or unconsciously I don't know whoever prepared the address 		
	obviously did it consciously has blacked out all reference to this		
	 spreading cancer and has given no indication of the type of people		
	who are indulging or who are in the position to indulge in this kind		
	of financial criminality 		
	So on the twenty-nineth of January a front page news item		
	 has appeared in one of our leading dailies namely The		
	Statesman 		
	Giving a list of forty-two people belonging to different		
	parties who are alleged to have been funded 		
	I the same people the same group of people who had uh		
	 been used by the ISI to fund the 		
	Hizbul Mujahideen and the accused in the Bombay Bomblasts		
	I don't know what is the political connection I can't uh 		
	easily find it out 		
	But anyway this is a case there in the Supreme Court now		
	pending 		
	Their names are given in this news item along with the amounts		
	of money which they are alleged to have received 		
	Among that uh major number of people come from the		
	 Congress party than uh from also from the		
	 BJP also from the Janata Dal 		
	 also from the Janata Dal Samajwadi fewer fewer		
	 the bulk of the names are from the Congress party 		
	Sir these are all honourable gentlemen 		
	Most of them are members of parliament some have been ministers		
	some are presently minister and uh I think that a paper which 		
	publishes this kind of serious type of allegation should either be		
	proceeded against by way of defamation proceedings in the court which has		
	not been done 		
	Or atleast the people who are named among these forty-two 		
	should have come out publicly with some denial or some contradiction 		
	which has not been done 		
	I neither know whether this allegations are correct or can be		
	correct or not 		
	But what is surprising me is you see a news report like this 		
	had created quite a lot of uh sensation and pendomonium among the		
	public who read these papers 		
	But no contradictions denials or defamation case or anything is		
	coming 		
	So this is very curious it seems to me 		
	And I want to draw the attention to this house that the		
	honourable members concerned should really be more serious about this		
	and take uh whatever necessary action they feel they should take 		
	But nothing has been done 		
	So my point is interruption that these these		
	cases will go on multiplying 		
	Not because of any individuals proclamities because of what I		
	said there is a economic and social forces are operating 		
	Black money is at the root of it and black money is leading to		
	proliferation of this type of corruption 		
	And the more that spreads people are thinking that well so many		
	people two words whether MPs or ministers or anybody else		
	 must have got also got something to do with this corruption		
	Is that good for the future of our country ?		
	So I am saying that this is a matter which everybody should		
	take seriously 		
	The President's address doesn't say anything about		
	these things		
	It doesn't say anything		
	It doesn't even mention a big event which took place in 		
	last year in ninety-three a very big event which was the scam		
	 the banking scam 		
	Is it just a small trivial matter ?		
	Is there no mention about it ?		
	You could say that such a thing happened we set-up a joint		
	parliamentary committee the joint parliamentry committee two words		
	 do it they have uh submitted their report and the uh prime		
	minister has assured parliament that a follow up action will be taken		
	against people who are guilty and all that 		
	There is no mention of the fact that eight thousand 		
	crores or may be more twelve thousand crores 		
	some people say 		
	The Bofors is chicken feed compare to this 		
	Bofors was only some sixty sixty-five crores 		
	Eight thousand to twelve thousand crores 		
	which was public's money deposited in the banks 		
	Why do public put money in the banks ?		
	Because they believe that it is in safe custody when it is in the		
	banks 		
	In small people also pensioners small people put money in the		
	banks 		
	But if thousands of crores of rupees		
	 you see is goes away from the back door the 		
	banks' one word virtue of a nexus between brokers 		
	bankers the businessmen and so many types of people who are in nexus		
	with each other		
	That money is funnelled out siphoned out from the bank 		
	In order to go and put money in the hands of these		
	speculators on the stock market stock exchange 		
	Is it a small matter ?		
	Such a thing never happened in our country before and it 		
	 is has affected mainly the public sector banking		
	system 		
	The nationalised banks about which Indira Gandhi has spoken		
	at the time of nationalisation that these are going to be the real		
	commanding heights of the economy 		
	Now what what is happening ?		
	So there is no mention in the President's 		
	address		
	So how can I thank him for this address I don't know which		
	completely avoids any mention of these things 		
	And what fate will other committees have ?		
	If the J P C is report is dealt with like this 		
	When the debate took place here in this house some people were		
	doing their best to denigrate such a report to dilute it and to say		
	which is not of much consequence 		
	So what will be the fate of other committees ?		
	What will be the fate of these uh uh standing committees		
	which are now operating which are also formed on an all-party basis 		
	What will happen to their reports and their recommends		
	 recommendations 		
	No body will bother about 		
	See it's part of our system isn't it ?		
	 It's part of our parliamentary system 		
	It all depends how you look at it how much you respect those		
	 institutions and how far you are prepared to carry out what they say		
	or not 		
	We are in a parliamentary form of government		
	If you want to have some other form of government of course it is		
	different matter 		
	But so long as this country has been commited to the parliamentary		
	democracy form of government multi-party system based on adult franchise 		
	so long you cannot escape what is called parliamentary accountability 		
	 Thats' the big biggest and only surviving super		
	power in the world today is deliberately trying to fish in troubled		
	waters in Kashmir and their spokesman have been coming out with so		
	many statements which are patently anti-Indian anti-Indian		
	sovereignity 		
	I believe Mr Chavan has said something quite was 		
	right about this yesterday		
	If I'm correct then I congratulate him for that 		
	And uh it would have been better if the President's		
	 address had also you see included something about this 		
	because I want to point out one thing it is not correct that will be wrong to		
	think that what they what the Americans are raking up is only a question		
	of human rights violation of human rights 		
	 That's only one aspect of it 		
	They are talking about a civil war they say civil war is		
	going on in Kashmir 		
	In his addressed address to the General		
	Assembly of the United Nations the President Clinton has said it that		
	conditions of civil war are developing in Kashmir 		
	Civil war is a term which has a specific meaning 		
		 ( a) Whether it is a fact that twenty-four odd doctors who had	
		been on plague control duty at the Indira Gandhi international airport since	
		October first nineteen ninety-four were on duty till twenty-ninth	
		November nineteen ninety-four more than a month after the 	
		World Health Organization declared that plague was no more a	
		threat in the country and ( b) 	
		 If so the details and reason for retaining the team at the	
		airport for such a long period 	
		Sir question number two zero two ( a) and ( b) I have	
		check at the airport they were continue even after plague was fully	
		contained to alliviate the apprehension of the other countries as per as	
		the recommendation of World Health Organisation 	
		Uh next 	
		It is good thing that the government has extended the stay of	
		doctors at the international airport on the advice of the 	
		 World Health Organization 	
		But the main point is why this dreadful disease or epidemic 	
		has suddenly appeared in our country 	
		Whether the government have necessary impact of the origin	
		and impact of the plague why it came suddenly ?	
		And what steps government has taken in order to assess the	
		 epidemic and uh the loss of life and property and also	
		 what steps have been taken on the uh recommendations for uh 	
		memorandum submitted by the municipal union of uh Surat which said	
		 in the wake of floods in Tapti river and the wake of large amount of	
		garbage piling up there they advised the municipal authorities and	
		the government to appoint number of uh extra staff to clear the	
		garbage 	
		But the government did not take	
		What steps the government had taken to review the causes	
		for this disease and its eradication ?	
		Thank you	
		Honourable minister 	
		Sir as soon as we got the report of the plague occurance	
		in the Beed district of Maharashtra and subsequently in Surat sir the	
		government of India has taken all possible help sending expert and	
		medicine and all support to the uh respective state government to control	
		plague sir 	
		Sir about the occurrence of plague in our country sir we have	
		 appointed a committee under a renowned sci medical scientist	
		Dr Ramaswamy Lingam	
		Sir uh Ra interruption Ramalingam Swamy	
		and they they are requested to give their have a detailed study	
		and give report report within six months sir	
		About about the uh memorandum submitted by Surat I I don't have	
		any information about that sir at at present 	
		Second supplementary please 	
		The main cause for the occurrence of plague and we	
		recently we had recurrence of malaria also in some parts of the country 	
		So the health of the country is going down like this and	
		the government has not taken any steps	
		But the main point I would like to ask the minister is	
		 this piling up of garbage in municipality though it was cleared up	
		in the first days after the occurrence of plague 	
		But subsequently it was stopped 	
		It is due to lack of financial resources with municipalities 	
		and government has taken up evolved a plan to provide finances to	
		clean up this garbage so that such diseases do not occur in future	
		Any plan of action is being contemplated by the government 	
		Sir the garbage problem all over the country specially	
		the municipal corporation are all over the country sir and this municipal	
		corporation administration come under the State governemnt sir	
		We are in contact with the state government to take appropriate	
		action to clean up clean up their keep clean their city sir	
		And and that part we have informed the State government	
		Sir not only the plague there are ot 	
		other it is a very unhealthy scene to have one word in any	
		city or in any municipal uh uh area sir and and it is directly under	
		the State government	
		But we have uh uh told the State government to take	
		appropriate action so that there should not be any one word but 	
		it is upto the State government sir 	
		Mr Das Shri Guru Das Gupta 	
		Sir the cause for plague is piling up garbage one of	
		the causes 	
		And there is piling of garbage everywhere 	
		Now the honourable minister says that it has advised the	
		municipal corporations to clean the garbage 	
		But the point is import important 	
		 point is they are all all the diseases are reappearing 	
		plague malaria cholera they all reappeared 	
		But right to health is a normal human right 	
		Without passing on the path I could I let me ask me	
		 the honourable minister whether the government Health ministry of	
		Union government shall make available additional funds for the use	
		 of the municipalities to take emergency measures for cleaning of	
		the garbage 	
		Of course political garbage cannot be cleaned 	
		That is different but the other garbage is to be cleaned 	
		and for this the honourable minister let him say whether he is in a position	
		to make allocation for additional funds so that plague and malaria	
		can be eradicated	
		Nowhere in the world it is coming up 	
		But in India again we are getting	
		What about the funds ?	
		Will you make available funds to the municipality 	
		Will you make available will you make available additional	
		funds for this particular purpose to the municipalities and the State	
		governments without just issuing a circular 	
		Uh Mr Chairman sir I can appreciate the honourable 	
		member's concern for health to the people of this country 	
		As the house is aware that the health is a state subject 	
		The states have to provide necessary funds for the maintenance	
		of the public health facilities in eradication of the diseases which	
		affect the common man 	
		Now the question question two words put the question about	
		providing funds to the municipalities on emergent basis 	
		To help them to remove this garbage which is lying there	
		 almost in all the municipalities of the country 	
		Sir as I said earlier we have been in constant touch with the	
		State governments 	
		We have requested the state Chief Secretary then the health	
		Ministers to take necessary steps in this regard 	
		Basically the municipalities or the local health	
		authorities local self governments 	
		They are the local authorities 	
		They have their own powers they have their own funds 	
		and it is necessary they have to make necessary provisions that	
		But by saying that we will not avoid our responsibility to	
		come into the aid of the maintenance of the health of people 	
		The honourable member had said that its nowhere in the world	
		But information in the house I can quote where plague is	
		taking the toll of the people in the other country interruption	
		 	
		I don't think I don't think I will be able to pacify the honourable	
		member but I am have given the information for the	
		 benefit of the house 	
		Sir uh in other countries in Africa Madagascar 	
		Uganda Zaire in South Africa Peru in United States of America	
		In the United States of America I don't a few words 	
		In United States of America interruption in Asia Turkistan	
		Mongolia Myanmar and some other countries in the world have deliberately	
		not shown that it has though there is plague 	
		So it's not that only in India plague is there 	
		interruption 	
		Please minister is answering completing his answer 	
		Sir there would not be any 	
		Please 	
		There would not be any more permanent conclusion then the	
		honourable member is a few words 	
		Sir interruption 	
		Please please please tell the answer the point so that	
		I can go to another question	
		Sir but one thing which he has spoken about me personally 	
		Yeah	
		I would like to inform the member not to the house in 	
		a few words 	
		Yeah 	
		That I won successively seven times parliament Lok	
		Sabha elections noise on public one word 	
		let him not teach me the lessons of integrity	
		 A few words and it has caused much to all	
		our concerns in a country 	
		But what a havoc more is sir the publicity alone in	
		publicity in one word improfessional magnitude 	
		So that it caused havoc in the economy of the country 	
		Most of the foreigners refused to come to this country 	
		Because of that our tourism income has also come down 	
		Yes in so many ways the ma the process has caused 	
		much the pre-media has caused much havoc to the economy of the country 	
		Under these conditions we should make the foreigners know that	
		the actual epidemic is not in the magnitude which is published for that	
		what has the government to do to contained the press to go publishing	
		like uh this alarming magnitude	
		And also in future also such thing should not happen	
		For that what interruption you see the question is	
		what steps the government has taken to contain the press and also in	
		future to guard interruption 	
		Yeah thank you	
		Thank you sir 	
		Unfortunately the media overplayed the plague situation	
		in the country 	
		Even when the world health authorities came here to certify	
		that the quick actions and very effective actions have been taken by the	
		government to control and contained this disease the media didn't	
		support unfortunately 	
		 It's not that we have not done the job	
		We have done the job one word world over we are being	
		praised for effective control of this plague in very quick way	
		Mr Swaminathan 	
		Recently I had occasion to meet the two words the	
		world renowned 	
		They had a conference in the India at about during the	
		time of plague 	
		And in that conference they have concluded it was not plague at	
		all 	
		The disease was not plague at all	
		It was a disease just stimulating plague and originally because	
		these people have found out and report to the press it was plague they	
		have been consistently saying it is the plague	
		He had also also given me a paper 	
		For want of time I couldn't go through it completely 	
		Well the minister is aware that there is another idea that the	
		disease is not a plague but a disease which has stimulated plague and	
		because originally it was said by some authorities it was plague they have	
		been consistently saying that is plague 	
		Sir uh it is confirmed by the N I C the national 	
		uh our communicative diseases sir uh one word they said it is plague	
		And it is clarified by the or supported by our scientist 	
		medical scientist also have supported	
		I K Gujral 	
		The honourable minister is right	
		Just a second just a second I am two words just	
		after this	
		In addition to what my colleague said sir	
		Yeah 	
		The honourable member wants to know about the terms of	
		reference of this committee I think a few words interruption	
		Yes yes yes 	
		 A few words financial matters will he look	
		Because not because primarily that is the agency to do	
		something that is why I want that there is nothing like that in the sense	
		of the interruption you can help sir uh I can repeat two	
		words the house 	
		That the terms of reference records is to elucidate factors	
		responsible for the current outbreak of plague plague and infact perhaps	
		it includes what it say interruption 	
		I say will they will the committee	
		Whether whether whether it is for want of financial fund that	
		also the committee can look into it	
		Alright then your you make it so clear and you write	
		to the committee that you can go into it 	
		I will be happy	
		Shree Guj I K Gujral	
		Sir uh the honourable minister has tried to 	
		underplay the situation 	
		 It's not a question of propaganda	
		 It's not a question whether it is so many cases more	
		or less	
		Issue basically is and I hope my honourable friend knows that	
		not once not twice not three times in last forty or fifty years 	
		there are any number of reports available and you do not need one more	
		expert to make it to tell you that that is no municipal committee in the	
		country except the N D M C which is financially	
		viable okay 	
		Now the point is sir if our you are	
		going by the plan and if the planning is to be made obviously	
		government I assume I hope is a is a corporate body works together 	
		 And therefore may I ask him , has he thought and approached , , the the	
		planning commission or something , that the structure the municipality has to	
		be increased No.(1)	
		No.(2) Sir, has the honourable one word thought in terms	
		of improving the sanitation methodology and technology because it doesn't	
		need a WHO report to tell us that our seat is updating	
		It doesn't need any health organization that we see filth around	
		They will first collect garbage on the road side and then we	
		remove it	
		And therefore all along disease is one word This incident	
		of plague whatever dimension I am not discussing has brought up and despare	
		at home	
		May I ask him if he is believed to undertake apart from the	
		committee one word to avoid the situation	
		Has the cabinet I wrote to Cabinet myself the prime one word	
		 wrote back to me that the one word and the ministry of urban	
		Development	
		Have the ministry of Urban Development and ministry of health set	
		together to evolve the comprehensive scheme to see that our health and	
		sanitation improves? Swaminathan Sir the honourable member is right one	
		word what he said about the maintenance of sanitic conditions in the	
		limits of municipality	
		It doesd need atleast throught and a coordinative approach to	
		solve this problem not only the health ministry	
		This is by the ministry of Urban Development, local ministry, the	
		state ministry and the local authorities concerned	
		As far as the one word necessarily we have to find a way	
		and in that direction we have to consult the the planning commission and for	
		that one word suggestion one word 	
Sir at the outset I wish to bring to the attention of			
this house the dignity of the two institutions the institution			
 of Rashtrapati and the institution the Governor of			
the state			
Sir Rashtrapati's address is an			
address of the policy of the government that it will follow and			
also the achievements of the government 			
Sir political and economic stability are the two			
sides of the same coin 			
We cannot for one without the other 			
Sir this government which came to power two and a half			
years back was facing a political turmoil in the country 			
What is this government even though a single party with			
the largest members in this house was a minority government 			
And we know the difficulties of running a minority			
government which has to take a number of bold economic			
decision 			
But within two and half years we have proved that			
this government taken taking bold			
political decisions and economic decisions could attain majority 			
Sir this is two and half years there is a political 			
polarisation taking place in this country 			
It is this political polarisation 			
It is this political polarisation where anti communal			
 forces and democratic forces coming together under the			
leadership of the Congress party that has given			
 a new political stability to the nation 			
Sir this government has taken decisions on all subjects			
 whether the government was in a majority or whether the			
government was in a minority 			
And for the Mandal issue we could find a solution in a			
very democratic manner and all the backward communities in this			
country are happy because they have got their due share in the			
governmental machinery 			
For about this Congress party has taken a			
stand from the time of Pandit either this issue has to be			
settled amicably by discussion between both the parties or the			
course of law has to take its verdict and that verdict has to be deeply			
seen 			
Sir coming to the economic front we have taken very			
bold decisions 			
And you know when it came when it came to power two and			
half years back what was the economic situation 			
The inflation was at its highest up about seventeen			
percent 			
 The if the foreign exchange reserves was kept			
 four thousand crores in two and half years back 			
Now it has grown eight times more 			
It is all around twenty-two thousand crores 			
So situation the over all situation is very comfortable			
This comfortable situation could be achieved because of the			
drastic measures Congress has taken 			
Sir in the seventy-nine prelinary session of the inter-national			
conference at Tirupati Narsimharao has explained in			
detail about the one word 			
An important one or two words speech 			
Since the beginning of the era of plan development the Indian			
National Congress has been inspired and guided by the vision of			
Jawaharlal Nehru 			
He has strong sense of wisdom and deep understanding of the			
 distinctive of the Indian resource let him to one or two words			
 all topman approaches and evolved India all synthesis 			
for the diverse influence which was inherently just humane 			
pragmatic and uniquely Indian			
The use of developed development planning was an			
instrument to achieve this stand and ensure the material well			
being of the masses and the dignity of the Indian 			
So sir we have never deviated from two words 			
And sir when our farmers are taking up this current			
 we obliged in this house on one hand we have been 			
one word what the political parties have been demanding that the			
farmers should be given a regularising price 			
There is no party in this house which has not demanded that 			
Every party is demanding that the one or two words 			
And when we give regularising price naturally it has to be 			
passed on to the consumers 			
In four one or two words exports enable to March			
ninety-two ninety-three the growth of three point six percent April			
to December ninety-two it was only three point five percent 			
April to December ninety-three it has gone to nineteen point 			
nine percent 			
Now sir coming to the employment we have taken a number of			
steps during last two and a half years 			
The Jawahar Rozgar Yojana 			
The Nehru Rozgar Yojana 			
then other programmes other employment oriented programmes 			
Yet there is the unemployment in the country 			
Sir the achievement of scientists the achievement of in			
the in our research field sir the the the the launching of the			
 Agni is something which is tough and fearless 			
 It's an achievement of a group of a community of			
scientists who have been denied a number of facilities foreign			
facilities foreign technology 			
But within themselves they could they could find out			
ways and means solutions so that today we are proud that Agni			
 has been launched 			
Just like the Agni has been launched in the space			
 and I'm sure sir sir this government will be able to			
give a new thrust to our one word a new thrust to our economic			
structure a new thrust to our industrial strength so that there			
is economic prosperity in this country then the peaceful the political			
situation in this country			
Only request is that all democratic forces should help us			
 should support us this is my request 			
I listened with care sir to the speech of my			
honourable friend D S P Mathur as also the second of professor			
Thomas 			
I also read sir with great care the text of the speech			
 which is really a not so much speech of the head of the			
republic as it is in articulation of the governments view point			
 also what they have done in the year gone by and what they			
intent doing in the year that is facing us now 			
So I could not help but carry an impression that the 			
that the that its a its a tired and a desperated emotions 			
A tired and desperated address 			
It was it was uninspiring in content and I was struck by			
the fact of the recourse that government could take of loading this			
speech with the a great deal of anti-statistical assertions 			
I found the address somewhat self-satisfied and 			
one word 			
The great deficiency that I find is the disharmony between the			
assertions of government and uh what I have observed as a crippling			
citizen that has one word many parts of national endeavour			
 and national life 			
There is an impression being different and impression that			
is attempted 			
An impression that was attempted to be created in the speech itself			
 has been one word all to do as if some kind of an imaginary			
 hump has been crossed 			
Let me put it to the treasury bench if now through an			
immorality through a performing of the participatory system of			
government is through one word of defaction 			
If through creating splits within one party after another you			
have rearranged the arithmatic 			
If you had simply rearranged the arithmatic let me division not			
 in variety of thoughts that you have crossed some kind of an			
imaginary hump and now rosy pastures upon the green pasture lie			
ahead of you 			
These are the first assertions that made by the Head of the			
Republic and by the government is about the north-east 			
These are his first assertions sir to create the situations			
with regard to insurgency in the north-east has shown improvement			
I do not know sir to what I should attribute such an assertion			
 that insurgency in the north-east is improving when the			
Governor of Manipur and Nagaland has himself without going into all the			
quotation from his report to the president it might be again be			
repeated the Governor of Manipur and Nagaland has said but			
clearly amongst other things that the above state of intense insurgency			
 and internal disorder and you would observe Mr Speaker sir that he			
is not talking in the past tense 			
He is talking of position as it exist in that part of the			
country in the month of August to October of ninety-three 			
The above state of intense insurgency and internal disorder is			
due to lack of political stability and will lack of an overall			
perception and monitoring of the worsening situation by the			
governmental security forces over after long period 			
You must have heard in the one word of government 			
cannot be made by agency of government itself 			
And if you want to argue sir that this civil citizen his			
observation is limited to Manipur and Nagaland then at all I			
am not convinced that the words that have been put into the mouth of the			
 head of the Republic by the government 			
I do not know to what I should attribute them 			
Is it a step by the government to mislead the nation ?			
Is it an attempt by the government to draw one word over			
the reality in the wake of the situation that prevails in the north-east			
 ?			
Or is it is it an attempt to to denigrate the			
institution of Parliament and to treat the entire exercise of the			
 address to the joint session of the Parliament as a perfunctory exercise			
of little importance fairly to a one word sir that the			
situation that we face in the north-east is of extreme one word 			
and the most extreme serious 			
I one word in totality the assertion of the government 			
that the situation in entire north-east is improving 			
It has not improved 			
And the sense of complacency about improving that the			
government seems to be putting across is a very mislead sense and it			
will be extremely challenging to the Republic 			
Thanks oh thanks to very briefly mention just two or three aspects			
of the current situation of Jammu and Kashmir 			
There is an assertion made in the President's address 			
And an assertion which suggests that it was the strength			
displayed by the government in the unfortunate in incident			
at Hazratbal which restrained the demonstrative itself through success			
We have not yet sir not yet not till today the			
Parliament has not authoritatively been told as to what actually happened			
in Hazratbal 			
The government has not yet come forward to tell 			
I repeat that demand we must come to know what actually			
transpired in Hazaratbal during that period 			
How did the situation come about that the army was obliged			
to take seige to that uh shrine ?			
And what transpired when the siege was subsequently			
attempted ?			
What was the arrangement that the government made with the			
seventy or eighty those who were in those that were inside the shrine			
 ?			
And how is it that when those that were inside the shrine 			
when they surrendered whom did they surrender to ?			
What was the role of the army ?			
And how thereafter sir that out of those seventy or eighty that			
surrender we do not yet authoritatively know what the correct figure is			
There is not a single one now sir is in prison 			
Not a single one is today charged as a serious terrorist			
 meriting those serious try 			
We were told that there are three or four or five 			
I don't know how many foreign terrorists of foreign			
nationality where are they now ?			
And these are not small issues that the nation can just take			
lightly 			
I put it to you sir that in Hazratbal it was India's			
 great good fortune which saved us 			
That this government made every possible mistake in the			
handling of the situation that it could have made and that is in			
Hazratbal the siege finally got lifted and with those that were inside 			
surrendered 			
They did not surrender sir because of the so called 			
patience shown by the government			
They surrender because of certain chances which are entirely of 			
recording broken 			
It was incapacity incapacity to think incapacity to act 			
miserable failure uh serious challenge to the nation as such 			
I demand sir that unless the prospects of Hazratbal 			
incident are shared with this house we will continue to hold I			
certainly will continue to hold that in Hazratbal this government in			
charge is making every possible mistake that it could have every			
possible wrong that it could have for the nation 			
And if the nation still survives it was not on account of anything			
that the government did 			
It was despite what the government did 			
It is not a question sir of this disarray simply at the level			
of Hazratbal 			
It is a disarray that start from the top here 			
That is disarray in decision making in the Union Home ministry			
itself 			
It is opened up we do not know dealing with Kashmir 			
The honourable the home minister for home makes one			
statement with certain assertion is definitely the honourable			
minister for state makes an other assertion 			
His excellency the Governor of Kashmir makes a third assertion			
The army is left out on its one word they make			
certain suggestions 			
The security forces are left on the limp they make another			
suggestion 			
That disarray this total lack of coordinate arises not			
simply in the metalistic sense 			
It arises principally sir from the conceptual or a			
 what is it that we are one or two words what is it this			
government is trying to do in Kashmir ?			
Where are we heading do you know sir ?			
And I'll be happy if I'm proven wrong 			
And I will I would demand of the government to share with			
us the figures and to explain to us that if these are government one			
word then how was such incident take place 			
I demand of government to share with the house the reality of			
what is taking place today in the district of Toda in one word			
 in one word I demand of the government share with us			
 what is taking place today by the raising of the head of insurgency			
 in the district of Jammu in Udhampur 			
I demand sir that this the government owes not just to the			
Parliament this the government owes to the nation 			
Unless the government share all this with us in this house			
 the government stand charged of neglect a very great neglect of a			
very great national priority 			
And finally what about those three hundred thousand 			
Kahsmiri pundit who in their own homeland so many			
years after the raising of insurgency in their own homeland are homeless			
No one can disappoint for them 			
This government does not have time to even visit the camp			
The pathetic plight of this three hundred thousand pundit			
 for the last three to four years 			
I charge this government for the most inhuman neglect of its			
own citizen 			
This is the most telling example of the blindness of this			
government in the face of human misery 			
Sir we have this yesterday celebration of presentation of the			
budget 			
I accept that this uh his address to the uh joint session of			
the parliament is not a debate on the budget 			
I am not going to even attempt that 			
But because the speech of the President makes a reference 			
to economic reform programme and suggests to the joint-session that			
the economic reform programme of this government is really their answer 			
to all the ill one or two words reflects the country			
Therefore very briefly I consider it my uh obligation to			
put to you my perception of where the government has brought the country 			
Just look at four or five simple assertions that I will			
take which are not assertions that I make uh one or two words they			
call it a very one or two words 			
These are the assertions that the honourable Union finance			
minister has himself did 			
Sir may I know from the honourable minister the government			
exchange rate and the market exchange rate in the market itself in			
Delhi itself whatever the intelligence report you may be receiving 			
But actually sir the market exchange the market is seeing all			
 the hawala market is going on 			
But if black money which is being created in this country is			
being siphoned out and uh the hawala market they			
are having their own fare 			
So therfore may I know from the honourable minister last after			
the convertability how many cases you have really identified or seen how			
many uh uhm cases have been registered and how much foreign			
currency you have recovered from this dealer ?			
Sir the government has undertaken various schemes			
like legally legal import of gold legal			
import of silver and some security convertability 			
And with this we have to take this decision the			
 hawala fares was really flourishing and the			
period from March nineteen ninety-one to March nineteen ninety-two it			
was raised between twenty-five to thirty percent sir 			
But also the government has taken so many measures 			
The premium during this period raised between twelve to fifteen			
percent after the introduction of several economic measures sir			
And the number of cases and also these once they marketed and			
 hawala rate existed difference 			
Uh in ninety-one ninety-two ninety-one to ninety-two and			
ninety-two uh earlier ninety-two to March ninety-three as we have said			
sir 			
If you want to lay it on the table I'm prepared to do			
it sir 			
Sir in nineteen ninety the number of searches conducted it			
was two thousand one hundred and fourteen 			
In nineteen ninety-one two thousand three hundred and ninety			
Nineteen ninety-two it was one thousand two hundred and			
fifty upto March nineteen ninety-three it was three sixty-five cases			
sir 			
Foreign currency you see enlarged sir 			
In nineteen ninety it was one point one thirty-six point three			
 three nine lakhs sir 			
In nineteen ninety-one it was three hundred and fourteen			
point eight five 			
Nineteen ninety-two it is one ninety-two point eight six sir 			
And Indian currency you see in lakhs sir 			
 It's about six hundred and forty-two lakhs			
 point eight five lakhs sir 			
In nineteen ninety-one it is one thousand one hundred			
twenty-two lakhs 			
Nineteen ninety-two it is three forty-one point five zero 			
lakhs sir 			
Upto March nineteen ninety-three it's one			
thirty-seven point eight two lakhs sir 			
Number of cases registered its se se 			
 seven thousand three hundred and eight-seven in nineteen			
ninety 			
Nineteen ninety-one it is seven thousand six hundred eleven			
In nineteen ninety-two its five thousand seventeen and upto			
March it is one thousand three hundred and sixty-three sir 			
Number of persons arrested under Fera itself uh number in			
nineteen ninety three hundred sixty-six and nineteen ninety-one its three			
thirty-six sir			
In nineteen ninety-two it's four thirty-seven and 			
thirty-six			
Number of persons detained under cognizable offence 			
interruption 			
And also sir it's a one word 			
He was asking how many cases ?			
Yes sir I can tell you sir			
Okay fine 			
Under Fera itself since nineteen in August nineteen			
ninety-two 			
The exchange rate also			
Yes sir 			
Market exchange rate also			
Yes I can tell you 			
Upto twenty seven three uh ninety-three sir 			
right we have booked fourteen cases sir 			
 Right 			
And if you want me each case individually and each amount			
involved I can tell you sir 			
 No no don't want that is enough			
And also sir the market exchange rate sir in 			
in February ninety-two upto February ninety-three the			
market exchange rate upto the date was in February ninety-three it was			
twenty-six point two zero sir 			
In February ninety-two the March ninety-two it was twenty-five			
point eight nine sir actually and also the Bombay hawala			
 market rate sir as we could uh collect the information it was			
 only thirty-four thirty-four rupees in the 			
February ninety-three sir 			
Just it's premium in percentage it's only			
twelve percent sir			
And in March nineteen ninety-three sir the percentage			
of premium in hawala rate it has come down to ten point			
seven 			
In April it has come down to ten point four and against 			
it's a big rise slight rise in eighth of April it is eleven point			
four 			
Now on sixteenth April it is eleven point six sir			
Relevance			
Yes 			
Sir if within that the actual market rate is now			
eleven point some eleven point six			
No it is the percentage of premium market			
It is the percentage that's the gap that's 			
there and that's the gap that attracts the no no the			
the black marketists to go to the hawala market instead			
of going coming to the open market 			
 No no 			
That is the speculative 			
So that's why all these schemes of liberalisation whatever			
you have announced that has no impact the impact is yes in the gold			
field that has that is some impact 			
But actually the hawala market as is being			
reported everyday in the newspaper that hawala market is			
going on and going on in a full speed 			
And the the objectives whatever you have announced during			
this kind of liberalisation and all this things has no meaning at all 			
And number two sir the Fera Act of section eight and			
section section nine the custom officers have said it contradicts			
against the specifications contradict the Fera Act itself			
And that also gives the handle for hawala 			
market to operate 			
May I know from the honourable minister that whether it has 			
brought to his notice by the custom officials that this Fera Act section			
eight and section nine of the Fera Act is being contradicted by the			
notification of R B I for which the hawala market is a			
negotiator			
Sir I don't agree with the honourable member the			
 hawala rate is on the increase sir 			
It has certainly come down and with the government measures			
even the these administrative measures it has kept smuggling and			
it has made smuggling under one word 			
And the second objective of these measures to prevent the			
all transactions 			
I don't say it is totally wiped out 			
It is there 			
But the government is making sincere efforts to put an end to			
such clandestine operation interruption 			
Mr Moghe			
But about this sir Fera Act sir as we are aware sir			
 the Fera Act or the amendment we have recently uh been introduced			
very recently sir and it would be very prematured to assess the impact on			
 hawala trade sir 			
 A few words in Hindi 			
Sir and the present Act under the Fera the persons			
who are involved in such transactions they are detained under Fera			
 and a two words and even then			
There a few words 			
Yes there is a provision sir yes yes			
Mr Moghe please 			
 A few words in Hindi 			
Sir as I have already pointed out hawala			
 case being a clandestine operation it's very difficult			
to amo estimate the amount quantum of hawala 			
trade and it's very difficult to decide on the revenue			
collections and other uh monitory item 			
 Shree Nirmal Kanthji			
 A few words in Hindi 			
He is entirely right that it is a clandestine operation			
from which uh uh for the people will reap all the benefit 			
Uh the question is that uh you had you had you had a			
committee to estimate black income which was entirely clandestine			
 interruption 			
Why don't you have another body to enquire legal estimate of			
how much transactions take place in the hawala market 			
 number one 			
Number two you have you say that the ra 			
 rate of return is ten per cent or eleven per cent on			
these transactions 			
Imagine the rate that is being given here it is an			
astronomical rate 			
Does it means that the real value of the rupee 			
 is that that much weak so that we can derive such a high rate of			
returns 			
And a few words there we will be no 			
hawala market 			
If there is full convertibility which the I M F is desiring of			
Dr Manmohan Singh 			
Just now it is convertability on the trade account only 			
You say it is a full flaw and there we have no hawala			
 market at all 			
Is there any proposal in the mind of Dr Manmohan Singh to			
go into that so that at one stroke the hawala case 			
is completely eliminated 			
And a whole structure in it that these illegalities in the			
foreign exchange trade are taking place not only to the unorganised			
sector of hawala trade 			
And you have indulge you have not made any CBI enquiry to			
find out who were the people who are connected who are connected with			
those who are arrested directly 			
Many important people in Bombay and others are involved 			
But apart from that your foreign exchange bank foreign bank			
 we are their hope so and not to account 			
Through which as we have discovered it Mr Nirmal			
Kanthji it is not violating it is going out			
 Mr Nirmal kanthji 			
Its becoming a long speech 			
I am not giving a speech sir			
Yes it is becoming			
Hope to account then not to account also to that also how			
much money is going out			
Yes cons constitution 			
of the country to access the uh hawala trade 			
 it's a suggestion and at present the government has no set			
proposal sir 			
And regarding the as I already said the government			
is making very sincere efforts putting down such transaction by			
making some administrative by taking some administrative measures 			
And strictly enforcing all existing clause Fera			
forty-four A TADA and other uh like uh under the 			
 co conva covered under the uh			
transaction sir 			
And as I have already pointed out sir 			
But it is a little too much 			
He has pointed out interruption how many percent			
 we have taken action in Bombay 			
We have taken in action on several persons in Bombay Madras			
Bangalore and even in Delhi who have violated this and Hyderabad			
 and and even who have violated operated most of accounts			
also sir 			
And this hawala transaction as I pointed out			
earlier sir was mainly operated through earlier and gold smuggling			
number two is silver smuggling and third is underinviting and			
overinviting sir 			
As the government has taken very serious view of situation			
We are making very sincere efforts to put down this			
 Ama how many cases you have one			
or two words 			
 You will get the find out this

I extend a very happy welcome to Dr Rajni Badlani 			
the English Studies Officer the British Council Division Bombay 			
I am also very happy to welcome to Dr Shastri 			
whom we have been missing for quite sometime 			
Uh may I request honourable Chairman to offer a			
bouquet to Dr Badlani as a sign of welcome and request			
honourable Chairman to offer a bouquet to Dr Shastri who has come after			
such a long time claps 			
And now that Dr Shastri is back and Dr Badlani is here I			
hope that they continue to be with us for quite sometime 			
When we want the British Council help and we want Dr 			
Shastri's guidance 			
So with these words I conclude my welcome speech and			
well I here request honourable chairman to say a few words A few			
words 			
It gives me a great pleasure uh to welcome Dr Badlani			
 and our beloved Dr Shastri once again to join us 			
We were really missing him for the last so many months 			
Now with the God's grace he is back and hope he			
will be with us for many years to come 			
With his guidance and assistance of British Council			
 the board of studies I think has come up with the nice 			
text book of standard nine 			
And they are also planning to have that the same book			
 of the same type 			
As I understand this is a this book has a new approach 			
It is a quite a good blend of structural approach			
 and uh 			
Communicative			
Communicative skills 			
In fact I don't know what is exactly structural approach and			
communications 			
But as you are mentioning it again and again I am			
getting to it 			
Any good change is always welcome 			
But as you know Dr Badlani no change is accepted properly			
 or whole heartedly unless it is properly delivered or 			
people are made to understand it in the right direction			
Yes 			
So it should be our endeavour it should be our 			
one word it includes Board of Studies State Board 			
teachers and students 			
We must prepare them to accept this change 			
And unless we prepare them to accept this change unless we			
convince them what is good in this we'll have 			
very difficult great difficulty to drive home 			
It is not only true for this English this will be true for			
whole syllabus since our approach to the new syllabus is also			
changed 			
We have included many new topics in the syllabus 			
The Board is thinking to have orientation of all teachers			
 in all subjects 			
It may be not may not be a exhaustive one 			
But at least two-three days orientation to all teachers 			
And particularly for this English language we require more			
orientation because it being a foreign language it's not			
our mother tongue it is altogether different and difficult one			
 to understand and learn 			
And as we all know the condition of English in			
rural areas in particular 			
 We'll have to have more efforts on this one 			
 It's of high syllabus exercise it's a			
communication skill and here only we lack in communication 			
Teachers themselves lack in communication 			
They can only read and ask students to hear listen 			
and repeat the same thing 			
But they hardly speak 			
So we will have to inculcate them inculcate into them 			
skill of speaking 			
If they speak then only the students can be able to 			
speak something 			
So in order to prepare them this Board of studies has			
envisaged a programme 			
And for that programme atleast we will again request 			
British Council and particularly Mrs Badlani who has extended 			
help 			
We intend to in the initial stages we are 			
have thought of preparing cassettes 			
Am I correct ?			
Video cassettes			
Video cassettes 			
But somehow Dr Shastri was not feeling well that			
scheme has also not come up very well 			
Nevertheless we have not dropped that we have modified the			
scheme 			
We will modify it 			
Instead of having a video cassettes we'll have audio			
cassettes 			
 We'll have audio cassettes 			
And uh I think sixty percent work of the audio cassettes has			
been already completed 			
Even if fifty percent has to be completed we will complete it			
And after the completion of recording we will have 			
efforts we will make efforts to supply at least two cassettes 			
per school so that each school will have a cassette to listen			
 listen in a proper intonation listen correct English 			
And if they listen correct English they may speak correct 			
For that also we may request British Council State			
Board and other voluntary organisations to help us 			
Secondly we're also planning to have master			
trainers course 			
Nearly there are sixteen thousand secondary schools 			
If we take one teacher per school we'll have to			
train minimum fifteen thousand secondary school teachers in			
English for English 			
To train fifteen thousand secondary school whether 			
 two words itself 			
For that also we'll have to have first resource			
persons 			
To train the resource person we have to have some master			
trainers to train the master trainers we'll have to have			
the help of Board of studies then teachers what you call them			
 uh experts then book writers and British Council 			
For you also Madam we request your organisation to have			
 uh your help 			
We will also request Central Institute of English to			
extend their help 			
Because if we can if we can train good master trainers			
 then we can have the good resource persons and then only 			
there can be percu good percolation to the teachers there 			
If master trainers are not good the resource persons will not			
be good 			
And if resource persons are not good very few will be very			
less will be percolated to the teachers themselves 			
Uh in that way let's have straight way from the			
 original resource only that is English British Council 			
We will have master trainers from there only 			
So that is also one request 			
And these master trainers or these workshops here we'll			
 prepare or we intend to prepare teachers handbook or teachers			
guide 			
Atleast then we'll have something to fall back 			
In the school they will have nothing to fall back 			
In big villages or big cities teachers have got 			
what you call that seminars workshops but in isolated 			
villages they hardly get any or guidance 			
So our teachers' handbook of particular subject			
 will be very handy for them 			
So one good teachers' handbook will definitely			
help them for that also we will have the assistance 			
I will request for them as for Dr Shastri I'll get an			
assistance 			
I think it is worth 			
I request representative of British Council to			
extend their fullest possible cooperation to our endeavour and			
make this project a successful one 			
If uh with dis discussion 			
 any finer points will come up uh I'll not spell out each			
and everything 			
Uh they have still some scope for the discussion otherwise 			
laughter 			
What will be the use of this meeting 			
Thank you very much 			
Now Dr Shastri is here 			
We have regained our all hope 			
He is our hope he is our moral support 			
 and he is our guide 			
 Right 			
 Right 			
We were really missing him for last nearly six seven			
months 			
Now he is here but even then we don't worry trouble him			
much 			
Sure 			
He must relax rest and work only when he enjoys			
it 			
You must work as long as you enjoy it otherwise you			
should not you should take rest 			
 Yes yes 			
With these words I conclude my opening talk and we'll			
 have one word occasion 			
Thank you very much 			
Uhm I 			
 May I request Mrs Badlani 			
At first I like to thank you all very much for giving me such			
a warm welcome 			
And uh I must say that uh professionally I have been			
English Studies Officer of the British Council 			
I have been extremely pleased with the work that the Maharashtra			
Board has been doing and uh with whatever little support we			
have been able to extend through what ever limited funds we have 			
When I compare it to this uh extremely new project in the			
Central Board of Secondary Education 			
I find that uh we have definitely not got even one tenth			
of the facilities and one which they have got because they have been			
funded by another agency the O B A 			
Ah but nevertheless with whatever limited funds we have had at the			
Council in Bombay I have kept Maharashtra Board my top most priority in			
my budgeting claps 			
Thank you			
And uh I will continue to do so 			
I am going to now put in a request for you know the other			
uh help that you have asked for which might mean uh may be more			
than one specialist 			
So far we have only been managing to get one specialist and			
uh for her also it has not been very easy to be working on three or four			
different books a centre 			
And now with the teaching training uh module I think we			
will definitely need more than one person 			
So uh I'll like to uh reiterate the fact that I			
am going to continue my support as much as I can for the Board			
And it's very heartening to see that you know the			
books have actually been produced and are supposed to be out from the press			
in May 			
Ah in this context could I make a request of support uh since			
our funding also is very strictly evaluated and monitored it would be			
very helpful for me if I have I am given even if it is the rough draft			
of the book 			
So that I can say okay this we have produced 			
This is the output of our input 			
And now for the further output we need this much input			
It will strengthen my uh case where my asking for fund is			
concerned 			
Because here I can show concrete evidence 			
It is no good saying that the thing is taking place you know 			
it's in the press etcetera 			
So uh and why I am asking it now and not when the final			
printout is out because uh I'll be asking for funds in			
April or May 			
So it's at the time of asking the funds that I would			
like to show some concrete evidence of whatever input we have made			
so far 			
Uhm I think I will not say much about uh what I want to			
at this stage because we it'll a lot of points will come up in			
the discussion 			
Uhm but from our experience with the C B S E project 			
uh we have learnt a couple of lessons 			
And that is it is important that whenever such uh 			
project is on to have a committee of people with of course one			
convener or whatever to monitor the progress of the project			
So that if for any reason some one member is not able to			
 come the other members can continue the course and in this way I hope			
 that what happened in you know when Professor Shastri who as you were			
very rightly said has been the guiding light and in fact he is the one			
who approached us the British Council 			
And I think the Board is very fortunate in having a person of			
Professor Shastri's experience knowledge and qualification			
to be the convener because he is so well versed in E L T 			
He has had lots of experience 			
So he was able to pitch everything at the right level 			
Uh ask me for what kind of suitable help I could extend			
 uh he I know put in a lot of effort 			
I think too much efforts which uh took its toll and 			
and I I also would now think that it is unfair that all the stress			
should be only on one individual so that we 			
 That's what Kadepurkar said 			
Sir again it will be one individual 			
I would suggest that if we have atleast a member of a			
committee of three or four members 			
Because even Harsh might at some points say okay now I have my 			
son's exams or my something I cannot come 			
So I think it is better to have a committee and not then again			
pressurise Harsh uh as much 			
So it will and all sudden done three or four heads			
together is better than one and also the stress which is on one			
person will not be there 			
So I would strongly recommend that for the project you			
form a committee and let that committee uh work together			
So that if one or two people cannot come atleast the			
remaining two continue the thing 			
Because this was a big gap			
You know I was waiting in the Council office for some			
information 			
And of course I knew about Professor Shastri's illness			
 I we did correspond over New Year when he was he was much better			
than stuff like that 			
But then we lost out on quite a lot of our you know 			
activities here which is in much one can always catch up 			
There is no I mean nothing has really gone uh uh array			
but I think I would recommend that you formulate a committee 			
rather than just keep it on one or two people 			
For the teacher training project 			
For the whole project not only the teacher training project			
For the whole project of division of classes nine ten 			
eleven twelve 			
We have now come to uh we've finished nine and eleven			
We are now at the stage of uh looking for identifying			
texts and selection of texts for ten and twelve 			
 Looking 			
So uh you of course spoke only about the teachers'			
 awareness programme 			
Am I to assume that you are also expecting uh rightly I hope			
uh some uh input into these two text books as were given for the nineth			
and the eleventh			
Yes we should include			
 That's it			
I have included			
So that is what so it is not only teacher awareness			
programmes			
I would prefer to look at it as the whole project uh			
which is the textbook revision and because the syllabus was already made			
we couldn't change the syllabus but we have tried to put in as much			
communicative skills as possible within the constraints of the syllabus			
 and teacher training and somewhere I also read that you are looking			
forward to some kind of evaluation of question paper as well			
Yes			
It should be part of the whole thing so in a way it is			
 it covers everything 			
So I I would not just say for the teacher training programme			
but for the whole project 			
And we depend of course on everybody's views			
That is just my suggestion 			
And for our looking at past experience I would say that uh			
 it will be beneficial to the project 			
Do you think the committee to plan or to execute 			
Uh plan mainly plan 			
Mainly plan 			
The committee cannot execute 			
Committee cannot uh really take up the whole thing they will			
plan for the execution naturally 			
The three or four people will then			
The work of the committee will be only the policy nature 			
Not necessarily only 			
It is not necessary only depending on uh the persons own uh			
 inclination his own expertise his own willingness 			
Like Harsh I'm sure he as a member of the committee would			
still like to be actively involved in uh the teacher training programme			
 in the execution 			
So it is not either or you don't have water tight compartment			
It depends like professor Shastri might just be there to give us			
overall advice because he has so much experience 			
He can tell us what he thinks about it 			
So he even he is very actively involved			
He might just oversee everything 			
So that again is very open ended 			
 It's not either or 			
But for example if uh uh uh a specialist has to come and			
say if two people on the committee are not available for discussions atleast			
two other people will be available 			
In the absence of Dr Shastri for some time who			
had been the guiding spirit for the preparation of text books			
 from nineth to twelfth 			
During his absence we have done our best to select			
some passages 			
I now welcomes him I we we welcome him to 			
to take the reins in his hand 			
So just to take a review of what we've done I			
would like to request professor Patil-Kulkarni and			
 Principal Krishnamurthy to make us rather available			
 the list of the articles or the passages that have been 			
selected 			
I request Patil-Kulkarni to give the brief 			
According to the plan evolved by the board of studies			
in English of said board of secondary and higher secondary 			
English Pune 			
Uh we have in all seven units of which the first unit			
is called informative writing 			
The second one is note-making 			
Third unit is distance communication 			
But the final decision is not yet taken regarding this one 			
The fourth unit is reading and responding to advertisements			
Workshop is to be done in this next week 			
And the fifth one is reading newspaper 			
Almost complete selection has been made as far as this			
particular unit is concerned 			
And I may speak a few words regarding the selection			
that has been made and the contents of various items that have			
appeared under this unit reading the Newspaper 			
As we all know newspaper forms an essential part of 			
civilized society 			
Without newspaper people will be in dark of what has			
happened been happening all over the world and around their			
own village or town 			
And so we thought it essential to intr 			
introduced introduce this one unit for the benefit of			
 the students studying in twelfth standard 			
We have selected a various articles 			
according to their sections 			
The sections may be alright interruption 			
One short news another letters to the editor 			
Other forms a report 			
And one form uh the editorial section of the			
newspaper 			
And then another spot news all these are relevant to			
the understanding of what has been happening around us 			
The first one of these is about an accident which took place			
in Bengal and about forty-one people were killed in the coal mine			
It might have been due to the fire that broke out and also 			
due to carbon monoxide which they breathe and then they died 			
 cough 			
Several bodies have been recovered where the final report is			
not yet available 			
But then every one has said that about forty-one miners were			
killed 			
Second one is from one word to the letters to the			
editor 			
One writes it about Highway Development 			
Taking into consideration all development that have been made 			
recent years 			
The writer opines that we are lagging far behind 			
perhaps generations behind the other countries our Asian countries			
particularly Singapore Indonesia Malaysia etcetera 			
They have forged far ahead of us in the maintenance of the			
highways 			
So here presented a few developments that have			
been taken by the government of India in maintaining the highways			
The last two of it is consist spot news giving			
information regarding what's happening at the centre for the			
budget session was opened on the last day of the session 			
The information is given earlier and what items could be			
included into the session into the small views mentioned 			
We shall come back to it			
 That's about unit five 			
Unit six deals with persuading for which others will speak			
And seventh unit narrating would be at spoken			
about by some other person 			
And then we come to imaginative writing section two 			
And which contains poems and other imaginative things 			
And the last section is rapid reading which particularly			
full of short short stories 			
And in the earlier section imaginative writing we have			
selected a number of poems 			
Out of ten I will present only three poems only two or			
three poems 			
And in this another one Pulley by			
George Herbert which many of the people already know about it 			
It tells about the human being generation and regeneration			
 and the humanisation or whatever it is in this world 			
 They're known to each and everyone I don't think 			
I'll spent much time on this 			
 You can pass pass over			
Pass over 			
And the next one is uh by a black poet Oleghe 			
I feel A Sudden Storm the			
environmental situation presented in this poem is almost			
similar to Indian environment 			
Before storm comes rain comes there is a lull lull			
before the storm 			
And children gather in that lull and the coming sign of			
storm people are worried they go in search of their children 			
They are calling them of but the children don't listen			
to them			
For children love the storm and it is about to rain 			
And suddenly when all the winds are cleared people are			
there in their houses 			
Storm raises thunder takes over lightning is there and			
suddenly it starts pouring down 			
And children enjoy themselves playing out in the rain			
That is a poem by a black poet which is also very			
relevant of Indian one word 			
After this we go to the rapid reading section uh 			
 I'll speak on only two or three			
Fine 			
Uh haan 			
Yeah 			
Uh selected stories 			
One is the well known story The Cop and the			
Anthem by O Henry 			
This is typical Henrian uh short story having a twist in			
the tale 			
You know how that is 			
Here a one word convict Soapy he is now			
facing an ordeal 			
As the winter was approaching he wanted to find a shelter 			
warm shelter from that interruption 			
The best idea was to go back to prison so that he would get			
some warm corner there 			
But unfortunately all his efforts in trying to go back to the			
prison failed 			
Sincere efforts at that but then when all these things			
failed he comes near a church where prayer was going on 			
And he felt certain trasformation 			
So he decided to live a honest life put an end to 			
his stop this stealing business 			
But the moment this transformation came next came the hand of a			
cop on his shoulder one word what are you doing here 			
he says nothing 			
 One word 			
And the last one that I'm discussing on is			
 The Nightingale 			
 Nightingale again brings to to our			
memories various feelings that we pines for Nightingale and 			
story viewers also have written on Nightingale 			
This one is by Hans Anderson 			
This a lengthy story telling about a bird Nightingale			
bird who sings sweetly in some remote corner on the shores			
There was an emperor Chinese emperor who has all the			
greatest things in the world in his empire in his court 			
And then somehow he comes to know casually there is a			
wonderful bird singing a very melodious song day and night 			
He likes to hear that 			
Ultimately the girl who had heard it first persuade this bird			
 to comes come to King's court			
And then the bird sings to the satisfaction of the great			
emperor 			
And this emperor makes a golden cage for it with			
all the amenities and a place a designation in the court honour 			
as a court singer 			
The bird everyday goes on singing 			
But this she cannot continue for a long time the bird is also			
mortal being 			
And so to immortalise the song of a bird a genius was there			
 scientist who made a machine which would reproduce the song 			
exactly as Nightingale 			
When the button was on it will go on singing like Nightingale			
And the people appreciated him 			
And then everyone neglected this bird original bird 			
And the bird felt very sad 			
And it flew away from 			
And then once this machine is uh that gets out of order			
 though it was repaired it could not produce the melodious song as			
before 			
Then the emperor felt that he was missing this music 			
And on account of this he fell ill 			
People went in search of the bird they could not find 			
Ultimately the emperor thinks of Nightingale bird 			
prays the bird to come back to emperor the emperor was on his			
death bed so he is only saved by the song of the bird 			
The bird comes two words from one word of			
the window and then sings 			
The emperor very much one word he started recovering 			
He only said that we can talk again the whole one word			
 but it'll come sometimes say once in a day 			
once in a week to sing to the emperor one word 			
So this is the story of Nightingale 			
With these few one word I think I've spoken 			
uh within the specified time that was given to me to review the			
items that have been selected for this particular book for standard			
English text book which commence from ninety-five June thank			
you 			
Thank you sir 			
Infact I'm divided between recording broken 			
these are I should compliment you or offer my thanks 			
I began that uh you are going to give a kind of			
report and it was rather a kind of prosiac begining I think 			
And now I think when I heard your review of the 			
units that you have selected I rather feel that I've 			
 travelled through the realms of gold 			
Thank you thank you now			
Thank you Mr Kaned for this opportunity given to me 			
to review a few of the lessons selected by us for uh the			
twelfth class English text 			
I begin with uh rapid reading section 			
We have selected about uh ten stories 			
And I feel the main considerations behind the selection			
of these stories are number one the sustained interest 			
Two suitability for the age group 			
Three the moral orientation the story may have 			
And lastly the variety 			
Of these stories I take first Fate a Woman 			
and a Ruby 			
It is a detective story from the files of Cecil Bishop			
 C I D Scotland Yard 			
The story narrates in a very gripping manner 			
how Bishop was able to find out the lost ruby 			
In this he makes several efforts 			
And a woman came to his uh age aid 			
But even after uh very long search almost he			
gave up hope at that moment Fate came to his uh aid 			
And with the help of the Fate he was able in the end 			
to detect this uh lost ruby 			
 It's a very fine absorbing detective story			
But second story that I've selected is The			
Accursed House by Emile Gaboriau 			
It is a story on human psychology 			
Vicomte reduces the rents of the buildings with very			
good intention of helping the tenants 			
But unfortunately this intention was misunderstood 			
and the people began to smell something foul 			
And they thought that there must be some other motive 			
behind it 			
And then one after the other all the tenants desert			
the uh house 			
And thus the house becomes an accursed house 			
The third story The Fortune tellers 			
which is a folk tale it tells about story of uh scholars 			
who out of their greediness ruined themselves 			
The fourth story is uh Foolish Friends 			
 by Premchand one of the famous Indian short short story writer			
He describes how sometimes even good friends 			
with good intention may become embarrassing to the extent of even			
ruining the people whom they want to help 			
Here it is about few boys I mean two boys I mean one			
boy and the girl who out of their curiosity and also out of their			
intention to help them 			
Uh eggs in the nest ultimately ruin it 			
And the the next story Once Upon A Christmas			
 by Pearl Buck 			
He is very absorbing absorbingly narrated story of a boy 			
who comes to the writer on the eve of uh Christmas 			
And she adopts him she becomes grownup 			
And he becomes a doctor 			
And afterwards there were troubles in China China splits 			
And uh Pearl Buck wanted to return home 			
She wanted the boy also to accompany her 			
But he refused 			
And he wants to stay back in China doing self-less			
service to the people 			
She tells him that the communist may not allow him to do			
the type of uh service 			
But he says he is determined to stay whatever may happen			
to him 			
Ultimately he is uh shot dead 			
And uh after these few stories I want to take up one			
or two poems that I've uh the opportunity of selecting 			
One is the poem What Kind of A Place			
 			
 What Kind of Place this is by Uma			
Parmeshwaran 			
This is a satire on uh modern life 			
Now we find all the windows and the doors of the house			
 shut 			
And the curtains withdrawn			
The curtains and no breeze comes in 			
We don't have the opportunity of seeing uh the natural uh			
beauty 			
And uh even our way of life is so changed that there is			
no distinction between man and uh woman as far as social life is			
concerned			
They move they move together they mix with each other 			
which for an old father looks very odd 			
And even cooking is done once for uh in a month 			
And he expresses his displeasure for this life 			
and uh he wants his son to open the windows and the door so that			
he can have the opportunity to breathe fresh air and see 			
nature in all its splendour 			
And the next poem is The Whiner's Plaint			
 in search of identity 			
This poem is about an Indian who is not known as Indian			
in his uh country but known as a Madrasi or a			
Brahmin or a Hindu or a Muslim 			
And uh he doesn't feel happy with these labels that are			
attached to that persons 			
And he wants to be known only as an Indian 			
And these are the two poems on which I wanted to 			
say a few words 			
And thank you very much for this opportunity given two			
words 			
In fact story has been the first love of every			
generation 			
And uh with so much visualisation and uh rather so			
much pain staking labour we have selected the stories with			
variety of subjects 			
And we feel no doubt that these would be very			
interesting 			
In fact the stories are interesting but the story			
telling was also interesting 			
And therefore for a moment we thought that the time 			
had stopped 			
When you switched to poetry and as I know 			
that it is your first love and the way you said something			
about the poem that you have selected has aroused curiosity in our			
mind 			
And it would be appreciated by the students at large 			
I am reminded again of the one word seed 			
that may sprout and flower when the text books comes into light			
Thank you very much thank you

I will be assure that it will be regularised and the account			
numbers will be given to all the three schools 			
As far as the payment is consent every pie has

As for the teachers' contribution our contribution and all			
that that has been done 			
Uh and H M has been reminded to uh follow up 			
Then Karate Classes uh have been informed uh about the			
deposits and they have started functioning 			
Now I am happy that actually dance uh for some years were			
being held by Mrs uh Darwekar Mrs Darwekar			
 Darwekar 			
In the last two years she had become very flat and uh 			
in the last academic year for uh one term she didn't run at all 			
So she used to give us uh hundred rupees per month			
 for the use of hall and uh electricity 			
Uh she was running also on only two days 			
But uh this uh academy is running the classes uh in number of			
 institution we use it only for			
 Institution 			
There is nothing wrong I tell you 			
This is an institution			
Nothing serious that			
But you see we can get funds			
Compensation			
Like borrow steal sometime if it is necessary			
steal you steal it			
 This is a 			
Yeah this is the			
For building the institution yeah and but not			
to put in anybody's pocket			
 Yeah and 			
Uhn this now uh Mr Ambujaksan he runs classes in			
 uh large number of schools here cough 			
He has got trained uh teachers and he also has classes in			
Bhandup and all that he had approached us 			
Now Committee last time in the discussion they said minimum			
three thousand you should try to ask 			
Now Vice- Chairman was here and uh H M was here 			
He called him he said initial years uh I don't know what is			
the response 			
So let me start by paying you two thousand five hundred and			
from next year uh we will see how whether we can pay more			
So it is uh or we have agreed and the classes have started			
and uh parents uh some twenty thirty parents have already			
registered			
The classes are run on Saturday and Sunday without			
affecting uh working of the school 			
Then uh initially we have made the enquiry 			
But we have not uh uh still taken action and in due course we			
will take action 			
And uh			
Uh I would I would suggest uhm one attitude			
Uh in Fort area uhm there is one Sardarji he is			
a good assembler and uh good service also uhm uhm 			
Atleast last twenty years in our whole building most of us			
are using that assembled one uhm uhm 			
Actually he makes the whole thing uhm for your			
Voltas also have he has given yeah to them			
And Voltas only puts their level endowing 			
So therefore you can also consult Krishnan yeah 			
for the price and other thing one word and only thing is known			
devil is better than the unknown devil that's 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Uhm 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
 Yeah 			
No here we have got quotations for about twenty thousand			
Known people 			
Known uh both the both parties are known and Voltas			
is charging uh twenty-eight thousand plus taxes			
And that's a lot			
The discussion was to find out from these uh 			
assembled persons whether during the service which is free one year			
guarantee is there 			
Parts are also free or whether we have to pay			
Somehow I had not been able to ask them 			
It is free service minus the part 			
 Include the part 			
That confirmation we wanted committee wanted and that I			
have not been able to do 			
Uh so that is and this uh you see uh we decided to			
open the account uh for computer education 			
Now little bit of background is necessary for some members			
office bearers are fully aware 			
Now last year we had agreed uh according to the contract			
 to collect the fees ourselves and uh then uh transfer their			
share to the party 			
Somehow we were not able to because bank didn't agree and the			
the one word collected the fees 			
Then uh we our contribution uh actually came			
back to us after lot of correspondence and then uh we wrote finally a			
letter in May asking the party to see us along with the 			
cheque cheque and uh that day all the office bearers were here and H			
M was there			
He brought the cheque according to the cal 			
 calculation it was about twenty four thousand or			
twenty-five thousand			
It is reflected in the account statement which is declared			
 Cheque

Chousalkar to just shed some light on the work done and uh 			
then we'll discuss the excerpts 			
Then we may appoint the three three experts on each of these			
 dissertation			
I think six of the 			
Six six six experts on each of the dissertations 			
And as the rule goes the names will be submitted to 			
the Vice-chancellor and the Vice-chancellor will prepare a list 			
of the preferences to whom they will be referred 			
Now I shall I request Dr Chousalkar to just throw some			
light on the work done by his two students 			
Sir two synopses submitted the first is by Mr S D			
Pawar on Social and Political Thought of Acharya Jawadekar			
 			
In his thesis he has studied uh social and political thought of			
Acharya Jawadekar uh to historical perspective 			
And in his thesis he has tried to throw light on contributions			
that are made by Acharya Jawadekar 			
Uh as far as understanding modern Indian political uh history			
is concerned as far understanding socialism is concerned as far as uh			
understanding of uh democracy is concerned 			
So and he has expounded his own concept of satyagraha			
 in socialism 			
So Acharya Jawadekar's contribution uh to political			
science is uh discussed in this book in this thesis			
And I think uh uh persons who are specialised in this			
subject should be appointed 			
So we have to recommend six names sir 			
The first name I suggest is uh Dr Rajendra Vohra 			
You prepare a rough list			
Rough list yeah 			
Rajendra Vohra 			
Dr Rajendra Vohra 			
Number one 			
Dr K Raghavendra Rao 			
Dr K Raghavendra Rao 			
Now Raghavendra Rao yes 			
Dharwad			
He is there in Dharwad or he is in Shimla now 			
That I don't know 			
First we will have to look into it			
Yeah yeah he has got that fellowship			
Fellowship in Shimla			
We can also suggest some uh names in political theory			
They are related to political theory but if they have to			
No this is for M K 			
 Accha

Okay seconded 			
 One word he should uh one word he should

 A few words in Marathi 			
That will be 			
Dr Mor More 			
Look Dr one word 			
Now go to the second			
Second 			
The second thesis is uh related to the Congress			
Party and Peasant Movement in Maharashtra from nineteen hundred and 			
thirty to nineteen hundred and fifty 			
Uh in this thesis Mr Jadhav has studied the			
interaction between the Congress party and the different peasant movements			
 that were launched in Maharashtra from nineteen thirty to nineteen			
fifty 			
Uh there was a very close connection between the growth of			
Congress party and different political movements that were launched			
by peasants 			
So the peasants played peasant leaders played a very important			
role important in Maharashtra after nineteen thirty 			
Uh the leaders of Bahujan Samaj joined Congress in			
nineteen thirty 			
In nineteen thirty-seven thirty-eight Keshav Rao Jede become			
the became the President of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee			
So there was a close interaction between the peasant leaders and			
the Congress party 			
And there was a conflict between the peasant leaders 			
and uh Congress party bosses like Shankar Rao Dev Vallabh Bhai Patel 			
and Balasaheb Kher 			
In this thesis uh Mr Jadhav discusses the performance of 			
first and second Kher ministry			
The first ministry was formed in nineteen thirty-seven 			
under the leadership of Balasaheb Kher from nineteen thirty-seven to			
nineteen thirty-nine the Kher ministry uh passed many uh			
legislations regarding the abolition of rural indebtedness or			
implementation of certain land reforms 			
The second Kher ministry took over in nineteen forty-six 			
The performance of Kher ministry from nineteen forty-six to			
nineteen fifty is also discussed 			
During that period the Kher minis Kher government has			
passed this important uh the legislation that uh the land reforms			
legislation that is land to the tiller 			
And uh there was a close competition between the rural congress			
leader and the congress bosses 			
And because of that there was a conflict between Mr Kher 			
and Mr Keshav Rao Jede and because of that conflict ultimately there was			
a split in the congress party in nineteen forty-eight			
And a Shetkari Kamgar party was established			
So all these things are discussed by uh Mr Jadhav in his thesis			
Now we can recommend certain names as related to 			
So R V one word can be 			
One minute 			
 Two words 			
 Two words 			
 Two words 			
Mohe 			
How about two words ?			
 Haan that is two words 			
You know that 			
 One or two words 			
 One or two words 			
He is always one word out of contact			
He has retired 			
He can contact 			
A R Shinde 			
What are the next ?			
What you think 			
Dileep 			
 I think you are very fond of him 			
 Actually one or two words included in			
that			
Uhm 			
His name was also excluded in that list 			
 Diwakar one word 			
Dole 			
Dole is there 			
Hukkeri College 			
Now we should be			
 We'll add this 			
 One or two words cough

So you can add Jangam here and can it be Rajshekharaiah			
Uh Rajshekharaiah

Uhn Doc 			
 Haan 			
Jangam 			
Jangam it will be good for this 			
Congress party			
Uhn Congress party and Rajshekharaiah will be good for			
 this theory			
 Haan theory 			
So then another 			
These three uh 			
There addreses we'll have to bring 			
No one word no problem no problem 			
The next uh thing is that this one 			
One student has submitted synopsis for one or two			
Two students have submitted 			
 Submitted synopsis for the registration of			
Ph D 			
Now one is Dinkar Patil the other is N R Patil 			
Both the Patils again 			
Uh now Patil Dinkar Patil wants to do on political leadership			
of Shri Vasantdada Patil special reference to his role as			
chief minister of Maharashtra from seventy-seven to eighty-nine 			
Now the guide is guidance of Rasam madam uhm 			
First one reserve it 			
N R Patil 			
N R Patil one word 			
So it is forwarded by you uhm so that is why			
you have signed			
 Uhm 			
Uhn yes yes laughs 			
 One word we have to know whether 			
how far the guide has taken into consideration the various works done			
Jamadar has submitted dissertation 			
Uh previous works have been concentrated on uh the			
cooperative movement not on Vasant Dada Patil 			
As a chief minister's work has not been done 			
He wants he wants to purely concentrate on 			
As a role of a chief minister 			
 As of chief minister accha 			
But then you have but that I think he uh 			
included a chapter on Vasant Dada Patil			
 But that 			
Vasant Dada's role in pre-independent period			
nineteen seventeen to forty-six 			
Vasant Dada's political activity involvement in forty-six			
to fifty-one			
So this is all before becoming the chief minister 			
Vasant Dada's role as an M L A in nineteen fifty to			
seventy-one 			
Then comes that is 			
That everybody know that he was a chief minister			
Vasant Dada's role as an immigration 			
 irrigation minister 			
That has to be done 			
Chapter two Vasant Dada's Patil uh role as 			
chief minister 			
That is alright 			
Chapter three Vasant Dada Patil's role as chief			
minister			
No the title concerned with political leadership no			
 			
 That is in consideration 			
With special reference to chief minister's role			
affair			
But the content is 			
Which also as a backdrop you want to tell it as a			
 Want to pass 			
As a historical background background			
 Background 			
In the introductory chapter 			
Introductory chapter he should uh he should			
Vasant Dada's 			
Introduction 			
So all the chapters are or based on Vasant 			
Dada's Patil role as chief minister and the			
period that is different periods are given specific 			
dates have been given actually 			
 Chief minister 			
 Different periods 			
Seventy-seven to eighty five			
Eighty-six eighty-five			
 Eighty-five 			
 Eighty-five 			
Then the last chapter			
You concentrate on that only seventy-seven to eighty-five			
Lot of materials are there			
 Haan 			
Ten years is enough 			
Ten years is enough 			
And if and if if chief as chief minister 			
Yes 			
We will record that also 			
See the problem would you have be 			
language again whether you will be able to do in English or not			
 laughs 			
Then afterwards you may again sub require to 			
 submit a an application asking that			
all materials are kept in Marathi and so he would submit it in Marathi and			
all 			
Actually it is going to be very difficult uhn 			
most of the students are writing in Marathi 			
 Uhn 			
 Marathi 			
So I think tentatively in principle we accept it 			
That he may be allowed for registration uhm 			
But the first chapter has to undergo as we feel that			
 Uhm 			
 We'll put it in the introductory part 			
No no again how one or two words 			
Look men don't even mention Vasant Dada's role			
as pre-independence			
You can just give a biography 			
Finish 			
Up to uh this one word sixth chapter is not			
necessary			
Uhm 			
Sixth chapter 			
From seventy-seven to eighty-five 			
Uhn you just put the title			
Instead of eighty-nine there should be eighty-five 			
Political leadership of Shri Vasant Dada			
Patil with special reference to his role as a chief minister of			
Maharashtra from seventy-seven to			
Wait			
Nineteen eighty-five 			
Nineteen eighty-five and uh			
There are only uh there are breaks			
 It's alright 			
But then the changed synopsis making certain changes in			
chapter one 			
To this we'll have the P G section to write to			
him accordingly			
Yeah 			
 We'll refer to the synopsis again 			
The changes recommended 			
Now what will be the changes recommended 			
Changes that is from period from seventy nineteen			
seventy-seven to			
Eighty-five 			
I think he has included in chapter one all those things 			
 no which you recommended 			
 No 			
Pre-independence to a period Vasant Dada's 			
political activities and involvement in nineteen forty-six 			
His role other than as a chief minister 			
Sir we'll conclude 			
 Everything has been included in the			
introduction 			
So I don't think there is a need of recommendation			
No you change the this 			
 We'll change only the last chapter 			
Say introduction			
Delete the last chapter 			
No let the chapter one be there 			
Let it be Vasant Dada a biography itself 			
Uh bio 			
Biographical profile			
Profile			
Profile			
And you want them to include but don't mention these 			
subtitles			
Uhn 			
Historical Biography whatever it might be 			
Biographical 			
Biographical profile			
Profile haan 			
Uhm			
The last two chapters ommited 			
Now we go to another synopsis which has been submitted by			
N R Patil 			
N R Patil on 			
Hindustan Latex Limited Kanagala District Belgaum 			
a Government of India undertaking a case study of one word 			
What exactly he wants to do ?			
Laxminarayan as a guide you better tell us 			
Hindustan Latex Limited is a 			
 If you write out 			
One one synopsis 			
If he reads I will write it out later on don't worry 			
Okay 			
Tell us 			
Hindustan Latex Limited 			
If you read out 			
 I'll read out the synopsis of the student 			
with uh some omissions and commissions 			
The title is Hindustan Latex Limited Kanagala 			
District Belgaum a Government of India undertaking within its			
parenthesis			
A case study of the one word organisation is working 			
So the title indicates that the candidate is studying 			
admitted to an organised outside of this undertaking public undertaking			
In his in his synopsis he mentions that there were just five			
 public undertakings with a total investment of rupees 			
twenty-nine crores in nineteen fifty-one which has risen			
to one hundred and eighty-six undertakings with a total investment of			
worth twenty thousand crores by nineteen eighty 			
This indicates that public sector undertakings are getting			
momentum in India 			
But uh as a guide I should say that number of public 			
sector undertakings in the country some are no profit no loss basis 			
Some are only dealing profit making 			
And this actually this undertaking this Hindustan Latex			
Limited Kanagala was established by Central Health and Family Welfare			
ministry on March nineteen eighty-seven 			
So till today it is hardly some eight years old eight or			
less than that 			
This factory is now producing condom Mala-D Mala-N			
etcetra and transporting such goods to Madras Bombay Calcutta Surat Delhi			
Objective of the study the candidate argues that to study			
the organisation in administrative problems of the Hindustan Latex Limited			
Kanagala it is very essential to understand this study from its			
perspective of growth of public sector undertakings in India in general			
 and Karnataka in particular 			
In this context the study tries to understand the origin and			
growth of this public sector with reference to the public undertakings in			
India 			
The major coordination administration the personnel and			
financial problem as well as problems concerning labourers will be			
studied 			
It also studies the production capacity cost of production and			
transporting goods to outside the country as well as within India 			
is has also undertaken 			
For this purpose he has mention his one methodology 			
It it says that the study based on empirical research 			
The primary data will be collected by using photo one word			
 techniques such as interview and questionnaire method 			
And candidate also argue that he intend to use questionnaire and			
interview technique for official one word as well as the workers			
To obtain as clear a view as possible we try to include the			
Governmental official about the problem of raw materials for factory 			
cost and transportation in relative problems 			
Minutes of the meetings will be used for the purpose of			
understanding crucial problems concerning this public sector 			
Apart from this primary data secondary data will be collected by			
using annual report journals periodicals and other published materials			
relevant to the subject			
So the data and matter are the subject undertaken by the			
candidate			
He feels that he can manage the subject within uh 			
two words three years or four years which is required for Ph D			
degree			
And the continuous chapterisation given by the candidate one is			
introduction second is the profile of the factory third is			
administrative organisation fourth is production and finance fifth is			
personnel administration sixth is conclusion and recommendation 			
So it seems that the candidate wants to comprehend the			
organisation working of the this public undertaking with reference to 			
certain broad areas like administrative organisation personnel			
administration finance production etcetera 			
I think the candidate can manage the work in the			
prescribed time limit in parts 			
So now uh we start uh departmental committee meeting			
This committee is held before the commencement of the new academic			
year 			
The second meeting which we are going to have 			
 We'll talk certain things which we have not decided in			
the uh last meeting was the thing is that uh now the			
students election you see I don't know how we are going to conduct it 			
But nevertheless as far as uh the decision of having a			
class representative of part one and part two no that has to be 			
taken 			
This how we are going to select part one representative and part			
two representative for the timing is less 			
Uh for the time being atleast because uh we have much as			
we are celebrating this twenty fifth year of departmental day 			
Uh we'll need some student participation in it also			
So how are we going to uh have to decide upon			
all this these things and involvement of the			
student in the whole programme which we are likely to have uh in the			
 academic year 			
This academic year especially 			
Now I would like to like the teachers to say a few			
words in this context as how we are going to be a whether we are going to			
have a depart a committee or you are			
going to decide upon class representatives 			
What about the guidelines ?			
Uh we have not received any guidelines 			
There will be a student council that much is said in the new Act			
But until elections are conducted and all 			
But the elections are there nominations are there			
The first candidate who has studies number marks 			
lead			
On the basis of merit uh students should be nominated that			
is the			
On the on the basis of merit 			
If that is in the guidelines all okay uhn 			
I think two words 			
So we'll talk of that			
Now in that case there will be one one student			
You see from part one and one student from part two 			
But uh should we have a committee for this uh our			
Uhm			
Uhm we can have 			
Uh for this uh silver jubilee function and uh			
 the one word students participating in concern we can have			
have like this 			
Around we are having we will be having hundred students na			
 from part one say and part second let us say hundred students			
 Silver jubilee function 			
Oh yeah more or less			
We can divide this hundred student into team and each			
team should be held by a student leader team leader 			
He will be having in each team some			
responsibility 			
And atleast two team should be one word by a teacher 			
For example if they are not going in a proper direction or if			
they are not in having some problem that a teacher can 			
guide them 			
Two team should be given to one teacher 			
That of a ten ten student and each ten ten have should			
have within ten one leader one word leader 			
So two group having two leaders and that will be under the			
control of one teacher 			
And these these students could do other certain duties as			
volunteers for uh for the function 			
From that way we can use the students			
In that case we will be involving the whole hundred lot in			
it			
There is nothing wrong in it			
For example if the function is for example three days or			
four days 			
 No no there is some confusion			
You see what exactly do you think you are going to do ?			
No what you expect from the students ?			
 Students yes so are they			
Don't be so sir			
To help the after this for example you know we may ask			
them to uh uh distribute paper			
For example if you have seminar you can use that			
Or we can ask them to you know uh uh some arrangements to be			
made they can do that for example all the certificates have to be			
given by the university so for purchase varchase they			
should be shifted up so many thing should be done 			
The for each one word we can first check out the			
activities check out the activities then on the basis of activities			
we can calculate how many students will uh actually require			
There will be uh some sort of arrangement be should be 			
there			
For example a a student may fall sick and uh			
Do you mean that uh whatever we have decided yes 			
for the uh 			
 Yes 			
Silver jubilee			
Silver jubilee			
One one year haan 			
That would be separate from what the students will be doing			
They they should be involved in that uh that programme			
In that programme			
Yes uh so a every for example it will be done			
throughout the year okay but one group for this month also 			
 So you cannot involve all hundred students 			
you you should make a committee and the committee will be responsible of 			
organising 			
See okay but at the same time the committee without the help			
of manpower it cannot do anything			
At the same time for example burden are there burden of			
the students will also be less			
For example if you give to one uh student for one committee or			
one month one batch for one month arrange that for since they			
fallen into uh settle for one full year 			
So we can use ten by the turn or each each one each			
month one we'll get a new batch 			
So that they will get relaxation also like that			
 They will manage committee will manage 			
No but we have already made committee no			
That would be involved in the sense			
 No 			
Okay these committee should be with the students we can say			
 see look here there are ten batches let the each committee handle it			
There will be no responsibility involved in what the committee			
is doing as the students are doing 			
 But then 			
Let the committee men for for example if there is uh			
let us say we have got five committees let uh one person in in the			
committee hand one batch or two batch like that 			
For example we are having uh this Chemistry Seminars we are			
having			
Uhm 			
Then we are having quiz and uh			
Uh like uh 			
Uhm so we are going to organise it			
Organise it 			
We just one assistant			
That is what I'm telling			
For the assistants only what what type of assistant 			
 No Lakshminarayan how are you going to involve			
all students in it 			
 All students cannot 			
Not			
 It's same you see uh 			
Not not at a time			
Let us say for example this batch work work for only for ten 			
ten			
But how how they will come and report			
Now Dr Chausalkar is going to have uh he's going			
to assist out for him uhn			
Uhn 			
His work			
Now what will they do 			
 They won't uh no whether			
 No 			
What we'll do is we'll do is one			
word we are having different committees			
Yes 			
Each committee will have a student			
Student group that is what I say			
Ten student			
Yes that is what I'm telling 			
My idea is			
That could be done			
Each group for example it won't uh burden the			
students for example if you don't involve all the students what happens 			
only a few students will be always over burden			
No on the same line we are having one uh			
souvenir committee attached to the souvenir committee we'll have			
 souvenir committee 			
 Yeah 			
 You can have one group in one yes they can			
do whatever suggested 			
 We are thinking that one word 			
Souvenir committee I I don't think it's 			
No I'm giving you example na 			
Example na like any other committee			
Actually actually debate committee			
For that 			
Debate committee who has got quiz also whatever			
it is they will help you 			
So each one this month this is the group it will be there			
 You see another committee is what 			
Three to five students may be involved in it 			
Uhn it depends upon the workload 			
It may be have three or five or ten or it might be more			
Now okay we've already involved them 			
 We've started it			
I I feel you have five students and the one who goes as			
 as per the new Act you see number one who is going to the students			
council on the basis of merit he'll be the chairman uhn			
 one part one committee and part two committee some five students uh			
four students and one one word 			
One would be chairman			
So four from part one four from part two 			
This is how decide			
You make two committees as far as part one part two is			
concerned 			
Now my my basic idea is my important issue is that we can			
give them some books 			
We are going to collect funds you see			
 Uhn 			
 Haan to collect money like that			
Uhn uhn see I want to use them in that context 			
So if you all put into a very business like uh uh contract			
 cough that's how uh 			
Uh we can do like that also			
No actually for that purpose all hundred coming laugh			
Should be involved			
Yes what is wrong in it			
Let it be four involve five 			
Do I work lot of work			
 See those 			
Those teachers responsibility of involving all the students			
Yeah 			
Otherwise you'll not get the money if you if you			
involve all the hundred 			
Uhn you'll make it compulsory in the part you will			
be there you need to get atleast five each student should get five 			
Uhn 			
Five what ?			
Whatever other students are uh donation			
So you you'll form two committees part one and			
part two			
Yes 			
And uh the man who is going as a the student who is			
going as a representative of the students council he'll 			
Let him			
Chairman okay 			
Chairman of the committee 			
First year committee second year committee 			
For collection of money it's enough 			
 Two words some students laugh but what			
about other activity ?			
Other activities means one word 			
 We should require uh students for quiz			
programme			
 Haan this arranging will be there			
 so many things			
 Essay competition 			
And for seminar I don't think 			
Uhn even for quiz competition you require some arrangement			
should be there na 			
Seminar also we can have a committee 			
 One word everyday you have to uh look			
See that you can involve all the students in that			
business you see why have committees and create problems to the well			
They have a another kind of feelings			
 Already 			
Already there are groups and fights			
Yeah why I'm not included in that committee I'm			
 not getting two division yeah so why should I go there			
 laughs 			
 Yeah 			
Instead of doing that let all get involved whenever			
there are seminars or quiz competitions 			
Okay next any other thing that has as Nanivadekar says he			
wanted to speak something			
No before that uhn we are going to organise			
 Shivaji University Political Science forum from next month almost

catering purposes			
The teachers quarter is no not bad

that she is here with us this afternoon 			
Now according to the official speaking the requirements of			
the open defence the candidate has to sum up the argument of his			
thesis in about twenty minutes about whether it should be convenient			
Officially you can take an hour laughs but I'm

findings

Questions			
Questions from from the external experts 			
other than the referees these questions should be treated two words			
 and then questions raised by the referees both the referees			
 cough and then if necessary those who are present here they will			
also raise their questions if required sometime from the candidate			
So I now request uh Mr Karande to sum up his thesis 			
Thank you sir 			
The studying two words uh some features of educated			
Indian English speech an one word study uh has five chapters			
besides introduction 			
In the introduction uh some background has been explained			
 as what led me to pick up the study 			
So some small work that I did in a partial fulfillment of			
 M Phil degree so that led me to uh switch on to these topics 			
Even though the focus of the one word study was			
 uh an articulate in phonetics 			
But here the focus is shifted to one word 			
phonetics 			
So again two things one is uh collection of data			
 that is Elicited data and Corpus data 			
So Elicited data has been rather you know not paid much			
attention for one or two reasons 			
And Corpus data has been uh preferred over here 			
For two reasons mainly and the one reason is in elicited			
data if the data happens to be the words are word-strings or			
sentences then this sentences and words you know most of the time			
they are cough isolated from the context 			
And so they are likely to loose some phonetic features 			
And so corpus data which is uh a continous speech may be or			
discussion or news particularly here the news reading 			
So it being a connected speech plus rapid speech you know 			
So all the required features that is one word features			
 of the strings and words required they were all intact or			
they were got all intact in this data 			
And so this corpus data it was preferred to the elicited data			
 cough 			
So the the limiting why this uh chapter or why this area			
 was chosen that is uh media news that is news broadcast on T V			
and uh Radio 			
So one reason uh main reason for choosing this area was 			
uh that now-a-days the media in particular T V it has been a common			
feature over 			
So for collecting data or choosing news or the news readers			
 or the news that we get atleast thrice a day so it has been			
invariably permanent feature on T V and this uh Radio 			
Plus the news reader chosen uh to read news either on T			
V or on Radio you know they normally represent all the linguistic			
communities uh that exist in India 			
And so this representation of the linguistic communities 			
they have been rather you know collected over years			
So these are the two reasons 			
So one more reason behind choosing this area and the topic is			
So normally we look up to this media news as a kind of			
English that might be followed by the listeners of T V and Radio so			
 sometime you know it is regarded as norm from the listeners point			
of view 			
And uh standard from uh say T V or Radio point of view			
So for these reasons you know this area was chosen by me			
 here over here interruption 			
Chapter number three is about uh Spectrography 			
So spectrography i it has been			
given a due importance in the study only because without 			
spectrographic analysis or the one word analysis the study would			
have been uh simply impossible 			
So this sophisticated device or this gadget you know it has all			
the uh facilities you know that gives uh over here the visual			
representation of all the one word features 			
So once we feed a sound or any sound segment to the machine it			
gives us uh the visual impression of the sound on the monitor 			
And that monitor gives us that sound in a one word 			
feature 			
So it records uh frequency it records amplitude it			
records du duration it records 			
one word it records a one word you know 			
So all this features they decide what sound is produced or			
what sound is pronounced by a speaker over here 			
And so this again you know place of the articulation of a sound			
segment or the manner of the articulation of a particular segment			
you know that can be to a great extent is decided by looking at			
or studying or interpreting these spectrographs			
And so spectograph has its own place in linguistic study 			
The next chapter is analysis of the data 			
In analysis of the data these three areas chosen for the study			
So the first is the duration and the four pairs of uh 			
pure vowels particularly long and short pairs 			
These four pairs have been chosen so the purpose behind			
choosing this four pairs was because it has been assumed or it has			
been uh talked of much by the scholars 			
All the people in this area that is Indian speakers of English			
 that is educated Indian speakers of English cough they			
hardly maintain the short long distinction in their speech you know 			
And so for these reasons these four pairs they were			
selected or these were they were chosen as one of the topics over			
here 			
So here while deciding the boundaries of the vocalic			
 segments over here some difficulties were there but to get over			
the difficulties certain strategies were to be thought out 			
And here the strategy is uh spectrograph machine or this			
device came to uh my assistance here because here the spectrograph			
 spectrograph machine it shows you which is a vowel and which			
is a consonant 			
So these features or the certain features on the basis of those			
features it was possible to catch or it was possible to decide the			
segment boundaries 			
So with the help of this segment boundaries this pure vowels or			
the vocalic segments they were detected or they were located and			
their duration it was ultimately again you know decided upon 			
So in this uh chapter or in this analysis it has been found			
out that is the distinction between short and long even though it			
is not very clear at the level of section but it is still there 			
There is uh some other reason why it is not that clear 			
But the distinction a short and long it is there in the			
speech of educated Indian English 			
Of course you know if we compare uh this phenomenon with			
the English spoken by the native speaker of English then it is very clear			
 that is length of any voc uh vocalic 			
 item or the length of any vocalic uh segment you know is not as			
much as the length of the particular or the same vocalic segment			
pronounced by the native speaker 			
And there is obvious reason 			
But within the system used by any educated Indian English 			
uh speaker you know he does maintain a particular kind of uh			
relationship or does maintain a particular kind of system 			
And where he distinguishes a short counterpart from its 			
long one 			
So this is one finding over there			
The second area or the second topic chosen so it is a			
dipthong 			
So on the dipthong three dipthongs			
Again you know even uh professor Bansal so he treats just			
 one dipthong that is A or OU which is there he says in uh			
educated Indian uh English speaker and others too which I			
deal with over here			
So they are A and another is AE so these two so my			
findings in this study they are very much confirmed with uh Dr			
 Bansal's and uh that Bansal's conclusions or his			
findings and findings by uh may be Professor Kachru and Nihalani 			
 two words these people also			
But here it was an attempt to verify it with the help of uh 			
 one word study of one word means over here			
So one thing uh the one way to verify dipthongs it			
was a spectrograph 			
So in spectrograph one one word feature that is a			
 one word and these one word were decided whether a			
particular vowel uh pronounced by a speaker was a pure vowel or 			
a dipthong 			
There was a second one word or the F two what we			
say or the hub theory 			
So these hub theory or the F two second one word it			
gives a clear cut picture of the dipthong as well as of a pure vowel			
If it happens to be a pure vowel then F two or the second 			
one word it is straight			
It is in a straight position and when it is a dipthong 			
then there is uh uh frequency shift or there is a F two transition			
And these F two transition it is in terms of frequency over			
there			
So it can be seen very clearly with the help of a			
spectrogram which sound or which vocalic sound is a pure vowel and which			
is not or which is a dipthong 			
So the finding are these that is most of the Indian			
educated Indian speakers you know so some of them you know there are			
certain news readers that is educated Indian uh speakers you know 			
of English that who do maintain this dipthongs who do pronounce a			
dipthong but the second element is not as stressed it is as boldly			
pronounced as it should have been			
And so the shift or the transition shift or F two shift F			
two transition it is not very much bold over there			
And so at the level of perception uh even though there is a			
transition shift even though there is F two transition that F two			
transition is not very much felt by the listeners 			
The third topic or the third area chosen for the study it			
is stress 			
Even in case of stress uh it is said uh that Indian			
speakers of English educated Indian speakers of English they do not			
confirm with the native speakers of English as far as stress is			
concerned 			
But there is a some pattern 			
But which pattern in the present study it has been found out 			
I particularly neglected monosyllabic disyllabic and even			
trisyllabic words which form again the great part of anybodys			
speech 			
So multisyllabic words that is words with more than three			
syllables 			
So they are called the multisyllable in the present study 			
And these words you know they have been studied uh for the			
purpose of stress 			
Over here it is found there is a word with prefixes and			
words without prefixes 			
So words without prefixes as far as stress pattern is concerned			
 they give a very chaotic picture 			
There is no pattern as such emerges when these words are			
studied but the word with prefixes you know they uh they maintain a			
kind of uh stress pattern you know 			
Of course there are three divisions under this 			
The first division in the first division uh the prefix			
doesn't receive any stress as such 			
But the remaining syllable one of them does receive a primary			
stress 			
The second category or the second division of words that is			
multi syllabic words with prefixes there uh this prefixes			
receive primary stress and secondary stress falls on some other			
 uh syllable 			
And the third division is uh where the prefix receive the			
secondary stress 			
And the primary stress again falls on some other syllable you know			
So the third type there is a variant the prefix receive			
the primary stress you know it emerges as a pattern in the speech of			
educated Indian English speech a speakers you know 			
And here this pattern it comes out or it can be regarded as 			
or the particular stress pattern used by educated Indian English speakers			
So this is the analysis so naturally the conclusions drawn			
 conclusions reached at so as far as duration is concerned 			
So the study says uh this distinction between short			
and long it is there 			
The one reason why it is not very dominant or dominantly 			
one word at the level of again we can say listening 			
And the one reason is it is uh due to the mother tongue or			
it is due to uh the way we speak English because whenever the speech			
tempo goes up or it increases so our habit that is the Marathi			
speakers or even Indians you know they pronounced most of the words			
equally bold 			
And because of this you know when the tempo increases or goes			
up all the segments including vocalic and again we can say			
consonants they get compressed 			
And because of this this vocalic parts or the vocalic segments			
you know and their duration it is not felt very much 			
But in other languages where weak form feature exists 			
over there when uh this tempo increases or it again we can say 			
the speaker speeds up himself then he counters these weak forms 			
But he does not uh or his vocalic uh parts of the vocalic			
segments and particularly stress are stretched stressed uh 			
you see vowels they are not affected to that extent 			
And so their duration remains uh rather unaffected you know			
On the other hand these vowels that receive primary stress			
 they are affected as far as duration is concerned 			
Uh the next is uh a dipthong this area and here the			
conclusions 			
The problem dipthong taken up for the study so it is said			
that it is true that these all the three dipthongs most of the			
time they are pronounced as pure vowels and not as dipthongs 			
There are news reader or some news reader who do			
pronounce dipthongs as dipthongs			
But their number is very low 			
And since it is very low you know and again the F two			
transition that is not very much felt 			
So this percentage which is upto fifteen percent or twenty percent			
you know so it can't have the central place in the conclusion 			
And the third is the stress 			
So according to me the stress the secondary stress or the			
primary stress and the tertiary stress 			
The tertiary stress this feature is not at all found in 			
educated Indian English speech 			
And the secondary stress and the primary stress there is a			
 again a kind of confusion but some pattern does emerge			
 whenever it is a multisyllabic word and that too again you know 			
 which a which is which has the prefix 			
So another category of words which is not multisyllable 			
most of the time but which has the functional stress in it 			
So the words with a functional stress so the same word 			
with a same one word shape which is used either or not or a verb			
you know so they receive a stress at different places when they			
change their grammatical categories 			
So over here all the news reader that is educated Indian			
English speakers you know they very well maintained this distinction			
such as now two words and so on 			
Here you know they emerges again we can say very successful			
speakers of educated Indian English speech 			
So the last meeting which perhaps was the first 			
special meeting requisition was held on nineteenth April nineteen			
ninety-four at three pm in the physics auditorium to discuss 			
non issuance of convocation invitations to non one word 			
teachers of this University 			
In the meeting after the relevant documents were presented			
 and after much of discussion about the issue involved it was			
resolved that in future the attempt should be made by the			
organisation to convene the authority that the teachers of the			
University shall be issued invitations for the convocation 			
that is all convocations to be held in future 			
Now that was the only item to be discussed in that meeting 			
and that constitutes the minute of the previous meeting 			
The meeting preceeding this special meeting was held on			
fifteenth January nineteen ninety-four 			
In that meeting apart from the confirmation to the previous 			
meeting minute in all twenty resolutions were passed 			
I will just go on making mentions of the contents 			
Number two resolution was related to felicitation of some			
These are continuing one word 			
Previously 			
No two words 			
No sir these were not confirmed interruption yeah not			
confirmed so he's right 			
So number uh two resolution was regarding felicitation of			
teachers the usual practice 			
Number three was uh ab about 			
 the acceptance of the annual statement of accounts audited accounts			
 for the year nineteen ninety-two ninety-three 			
Number four was regarding the appointment of the auditor 			
for the subsequent year 			
Number five was regarding the constitution of a sub-committee			
 to consider number one the necessity of forming a women cell			
Two enhancing womens participation in SUPTA			
 			
And three any other matters related to one and two above			
The committee was constituted accordingly and the committee has			
 in the meanwhile submitted the report that will be presented now			
The sixth resolution was regarding amendment to the			
constitution reserving two seats from executive council from			
the one word seat for the women members of SUPTA			
 			
It was carried 			
The seventh resolution was uh it was resolved to request the			
University authorities to modify existing quarter development rule on the			
following lines 			
And a number of rules were given such as fit 			
They were submitted to the university authorities and after			
taking due cognisance of the said rule the university authorities have			
passed a kind of an order in that respect and I hope uh the			
concerned circular has reached every department 			
The next resolution was uh accepting the secretaries 			
report 			
Nineth resolution was regarding resolve to allow postal ballet			
for Sholapur member etcetera because they cannot attend uh your			
election meeting 			
It may be very costly for them just for uh coming here and 			
uh that is coming over here for voting and spending uh not less than			
perhaps two hundred rupees per head 			
So they were allowed to vote by uh postal ballet 			
Tenth resolution was resolving increase of the contribution of			
the members by rupees five per month 			
The eleventh resolution was resolved to make it obligatory for			
 SUPTA members to be present for the national			
function fifteenth August and twenty-sixth January for flag hoisting			
 eighteenth November University foundation day and Shiv Jayanthi			
It is further resolved to convey to the authority that the			
same compulsion should not be imposed in respect of other functions 			
Similarly in the case of date mentioned above in genuine			
circumstances the teachers may be allowed to leave allow the leave of			
absence by the autho authority 			
Where in respect of anticipated absence a prior			
application would be submitted and in respect of unexpected absence			
 explanatory letters afterwards shall have to be submitted 			
Resolution number twelve resolved to authorise issue of			
 SUPTA to invest its surplus fund in a manner			
being beneficial to SUPTA 			
Thirteen resolved to protect protest 			
 to the university authorities regarding neglected maintenance of			
teachers quarters 			
Fourteen resolved to recommend to the university authority 			
to install E-mail facility without curtailing present library			
facility 			
Sixteen resolved to recommend to the university authority 			
to strictly fill in teachers vacancies by the persons having exact			
specialisations advertised for 			
Seventeen noted the suggestions made by members 			
particularly Professor Dr V H Patil regarding examin 			
 examination schedule and water charges 			
Eighteen resolved to recommend to university authority to			
ensure that whole allocations for research and development for			
departments are made available as and when necessary without any			
nexus with U G C finance 			
Nineteen resolved to make enquiries regarding L I C facilities			
outside sorry that is L T C facilities outside Maharashtra 			
And the last resolution was resolved to write to the 			
officer on special duty office for early payment of arrears and			
revive pay fac uh pays failing which a notice be			
issued simultaneously about a dharna uposhan to be			
staged in front of his office in April nineteen ninety-four 			
So these were the resolutions adopted in the previous general			
body meeting 			
And we have already uh men mentioned			
 the resolution adopted in the last general body meeting			
that is special general body meeting 			
I hope the members approve 			
Now about the Secretaries Report 			
After this report uh relates to the period after the			
previous general body meeting 			
Uh about teachers problems which are pending so far we'll			
 come to that issue at a later stage 			
But what has been done during this intervening period I			
think can be stated in a very brief manner in the following words 			
The President the Secretary and the member of the executive			
council of SUPTA attended national executive			
council meeting of A I one word on eighth March nineteen			
ninety-four in Delhi 			
At the same time they participated in a morcha 			
and dharna organised by the one word 			
Where the major demands were number one pay revision that			
is appointment of a panel for pay revision 			
Number two uh earlier demands which have been pending for			
a long time with the U G C and the Government of India regarding			
inclusion of uh teaching experience as demonstrators and tutors in			
the total length of service for placement purposes 			
Number three promotion of Readers to Professors in the			
universities and uh some minor things 			
But these were the three important major demands uh which were			
presented by the one word morcha on the			
Parliament 			
And I am very happy to uh report that uh subsequently 			
immediately at the same time uh the minister for Human Resources			
Development was very generous enough to invite a select uh you			
know group of people representing one word 			
They had a discussion 			
Subsequently the U G C Chairman also invited a larger contingent			
 uh for discussion where again most of the pending problems of the			
teachers were discussed 			
And uh as you might all be knowing recently uh the most			
important demand that is appointment of a pay panel uh has been			
considered by the U G C and uh a committee for pay revision of			
college and university teachers has been appointed uh under the			
chairmanship of Professor Rastogi 			
Uh as a result of which incidently the thirty-first uh July			
 uh sorry August demonstrations were cancelled by one word			
 			
Subsequent to that uh of course in a very casual manner I			
would say I will have to uh recall to you the two days 			
where perhaps for the first time SUPTA organised some			
cultural activities after a long gap 			
Uh one was that uh article show by uh Laxman Deshpande			
 from Marathwada and another by Vishubai Bapat uh kutumba			
 rangale kavyat 			
Then uh comes the mention regarding the efforts made by			
 SUPTA with the authorities of the University for			
installing or instituting rather a prize for a good teacher			
Every year to be awarded on the day of the University			
foundation 			
Incidently the whole affair began with the announcement by			
the authorities that a prize of this nature will be instituted for			
only non-teaching employees of the university 			
Not only that uh the sons and daughters and ward of			
non-teaching employees of the university they were to be given some prizes			
for their excellent performances in the various examination 			
When that circular uh was raised by some of the office			
bearers of SUPTA we immediately rushed to the			
university authorities discussed the matter with them and then			
subsequently a written demand was placed that the teachers are also			
employees of the university and they also must be considered for this			
kind of treatment and fortunately in the subsequent executive council			
meetings of the university the demand of the teachers was considered and I			
hope on the first uh that is coming eighteenth November nineteen			
ninety-four first of such awards will be issued uh awarded 			
And uh let us hope uh some of you is going to bag that award			
Then this womens' well 			
women's cell committee conducted two meeting 			
A report has been prepared by that committee 			
The report will be presented to the body subsequently 			
Then as you all remember we organised a discussion on the 			
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four 			
We have also submitted a demand to the university authorities			
regarding uh issue of laminated I-cards 			
Uh they have been issued to the non-teaching employees and			
again we were perhaps forgotten 			
And only after we approached the authorities and uh brought it			
to their notice that they have agreed in principle that similar			
laminated I-cards will be issued to the teachers also 			
Then we have submitted another representation to the			
university authorities regarding uh some particular problems of the			
 Adult and Continuing Education department number one and one			
word 			
Their problems relate mainly to some cofusion regarding			
new facilities whether these people that is academic			
non-vacational employees of the university 			
They are entitled to some kind of earned leave in lieu 			
of the period for which they work during vacation 			
That kind of a demand has been placed and uh enquiries are			
being made with the U G C as well as the state government 			
Recently just three days back uh according to the			
suggestion made in the meeting of the SUPTA members			
 very recently held to discuss Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen			
ninety-four 			
 The some very important deficiencies in the Act were			
discussed at that time and it was suggested that a committee be			
constituted uh Tandurkar myself uh Mr Kalme 			
Uh we were supposed to prepare a draft 			
I had been keeping in touch with these people 			
making request again and again 			
Uh may be because of their other preoccupations they were not			
in a position to submit their uh notes or comments to me 			
Ultimately I had to prepare my own uh note and I have sent a			
note to the Government of Maharashtra uh more particularly to the			
Secretary uh Department of Law 			
Uh of course if you want the contents of the letter I can read			
them out 			
Of course this is a very important uh aspects of that Act 			
So everybody should be aware of that uh reads the letter 			
to Honourable Pratima one word Secretary Law and Judiciary			
Department Government of Maharashtra Mantralaya Bombay 			
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four that is the			
subject 			
Madam uh at the unanimous suggestion of the members of			
 SUPTA I in the capacity of Secretary seek your			
permission to submit following modifications for your kind consideration			
and necessary action under Section one one six of the Act Maharashtra			
Act number thirty-five of nineteen ninety-four 			
Number one uh section twelve one A I should be deleted 			
as it will lead to awkward situations in the actual working of the university			
 because secretary higher education and technical education 			
becomes ex-officio member of management council of the university 			
It would be more appropriate to allow the Senate of the			
university to nominate this person 			
I hope you remember that in the selection committee for the			
 Vice-chancellor's posting the new act provides for a			
committee of five persons one nominee of the academic council the			
other nominee of the management council the third would be the			
nominee of the Univesity Grants Commission the fourth is the			
secretary in-charge of higher and technical education and the fifth is			
the nominee of the govern uh Governor 			
Uh very interestingly the position of the Secretary for higher			
and technical education is secondary to the position of a			
Vice-chancellor and in the actual conduct or operation of this particular			
Act the secretary will be a member of the selection committee and			
subsequently he will come to the executive council of this university and be			
a member of the management council under the chairmanship of the the same			
Vice-chancellor whom he appoints 			
So both for him and for the Vice-chancellor perhaps the things			
would be very awkward and everybody has agreed to this even uh in a			
recently conducted meeting of SUPTA uh sorry			
 SUTA this point was raised and they have also 			
agreed that something will have to be done regarding this particular			
point 			
Uh let me clarify U G C has to nominate one member 			
The academic council of the state university will have to nominate			
another member 			
The management council of the same university nominated one more			
member the Governor also has nominated the third fourth member that			
is one uh Mr B G Deshmukh the chairman of the rest of Maharashtra			
 what you call Vaidhanik Vikas Mandal or something			
like that 			
And uh the Secretary in-charge of higher and technical			
education is not to be nominated 			
He is automatically by his position a member of the selection			
committee ex- official

make it a point to draw our attention without any hesitation 			
And we'll give you explanations on every issue			
But normally in some institutions what they do they go page by			
page 			
Page number one page number two any suggestions ?

Yeah interruption 			
Let me tell you 			
 One word donation of one word 			
Anybody giving donation we are giving receipt that's			
 the one thing 			
 A few words 			
No let me make it very clear 			
We are not taking any donation from the parents for			
admission of the children to the school 			
We are taking the donation from anybody parents 			
students well wishers uh connected unconnected anybody 			
Whenever we take any donation we issue the receipt 			
 One or two words 			
Every donor is given a receipt 			
See we continously collect uh donations irrespective			
of their status 			
And then we issue the receipts 			
Now uh we have uh always tried to maintain cordial			
relations with the parents and uh often uh our English medium			
parents they are more alert and active than uh the parents of the			
Kannada school because they come from the economically higher			
strata in the society 			
And uh they are also often give us suggestions and			
ideas to improve the working of the school 			
And we always accept their suggestions if they are uh uh			
academically sound and financially feasible to implement uh these			
ideas and suggestions 			
Now sometime of course the uh the parents may say that we need			
 uh more time for childrens to play and uh Badminton court and			
such suggestions are also made 			
But they are not within uh uh you see our abilities for the			
time being but the point is that we too uh meet and we had			
recently about uh three we weeks 			
 back in the month of November we had a meeting uh of the junior			
uh K G K G section and primary and subsequently after a week on the			
twenty uh seventh of November we had a meeting with the uh			
parents of English secondary school 			
Uh we have tried in the past six years though not this year			
 to have a meeting of the parents of Kannada uh teach Kannada school			
But uh response has been very limited and therefore we			
didn't try			
But next year we will also have the meeting uh of the			
Kannada parents 			
Now Mr Chairman I had received a letter addressed by			
Keshavrao of fourteen points 			
This is within his right because			
He is a member			
He is a member and we had printed if you have any question on			
report you should raise it in writing three days before he has sent			
the letter and I had prepared the answers but he is not uh			
present 			
 I'll ask the Secretary to hurriedly uh uh mean			
inform the members what were the questions and we may give the reply			
that is understood 			
Now he had pointed out uh two mistakes in the report and			
uh these mistakes are uh accepted that uh 			
Printed mistake			
Printers mistake 			
The notice says nineteen ninety two ninety-four			
 it should be read as uh ninety-three ninety-four 			
 Two 			
 Ninety-three 			
Budget			
And uh wherever we are told appears in the 			
 I'm sorry wherever English school appears it should be read as			
 B R one word English High School we've not mentioned			
some places B R one word he wanted us to be specific 			
And uh he wanted to know why there are only three uh			
school committee meetings uh from uh in the English medium while			
there are six school committee meetings in Kannada medium 			
My reply to that is uh initiative to call the meetings			
entirely lies with the Headmistress Head Mistresses of the			
respective school and uh possibly the H M of English school has uh uh			
felt that uh many meetings were not required			
However we've already told the H M of English medium			
school to call the meetings more often 			
 Headmistress 			
Then uh there were suggestions to hold the continous uh			
meetings of the school committee on the same day so that there will be			
equal uh number of uh meetings 			
Uh my reply to that is that it is not possible because 			
the most of the members of the committee from the management side are			
honorary and they can't spend uh three four hours at a stretch in the			
school 			
So meetings have to be on different uh days 			
Then there was a question why there is a separate uh uh 			
 Head Ma Head Mistress for English primary			
 and why there is no separate Head Mistress for uh Kannada primary			
My reply to that uh uh as you know Kannada primary has a			
very small strength and English primary has more than four hundred 			
under the rules we cannot have uh separate Head Mistress for uh 			
Kannada primary and therefore Kannada primary is looked after by the 			
Secondary Head mas Head Mistress without			
any extra remuneration 			
He has also asked why uh Junior College uh is also looked			
after by the Head Mistress of Kannada High School 			
Answer to that is very simple that uh the Junior College			
is the extension of the Kannada High School and under the rules we cannot			
appoint a separate person to the Junior College the Head Mistresses			
had to look after that also and under the rule she is uh given by the			
government not by the management uh an additional honorarium of hundred			
 rupees which she has been getting 			
Now he wanted to know how often the various sub-			
committees are met uh my answer to that is maintenance committee has 			
meant uh met number of times to maintain the building 			
Health committee ha has 			
attended to all the health problems arising in the schools 			
They uh fund raising committee has raised the funds uh in			
the last six years at different times 			
And therefore the sub-committees are doing uh their			
functions properly 			
Uh how many life members were enrolled that is uh the			
question 			
The report is very clear that we have not mentioned any life			
member because we have uh stopped enrolling life members since nineteen			
seventy-four 			
And that is uh reason why we've brought the amendments in			
the extra ordinary general uh meeting 			
Now he wanted to know uh the forty-seven children studying in			
Kannada uh studying Kannada in English medium school whether they are			
outsiders or uh insiders			
They are our own children studying in Kannada in English			
medium but because their parents are from Karnatak they want Kannada			
to be taught and we've made voluntary provision for teaching			
of uh Kannada in the English medium school			
There is no compulsion 			
Similarly we've also uh introduced uh on a voluntary			
basis computer education for which uh separate fees are charged 			
and uh this is provided by on a voluntary basis uh they pay and			
 one word Automation company is providing the education and			
therefore the Mandal is not directly involved in the			
 uh uh computer education except providing room for computers to be			
placed 			
For the introduction very kind of you 			
A lot of work has uh gone on for long distance and particularly			
uh			
 as we noticed in the infield area			
But uh there is a a little scope left for improvement			
in			
the outfield because that wasn't quite uh a part of football			
occasion			
Uhm the toss 			
Not immediately clear who won but uh the two captains			
Mohammad			
Azharuddin leading the Indian Eleven and Amir Malik 			
the wicket			
keeper one of the few experienced boys in the			
Pakistani Eleven 			
Yeah 			
 It's unfortunate that we haven't uh had the			
pleasure of the to be say final of the Pakistan Eleven 			
for this			
match 			
But there are a number of other matches coming in India and			
of			
course in Sharjah later so that uh a lot of people are			
keeping things in			
reserve can't blame them for that 			
This after all is primarily a benefit one-day match and			
the			
two beneficiaries former Ranjit trophy stars from			
Hyderabad 			
Jyotiprasad and Habib Khan for whom of course this must be			
a very big			
occasion Ravi			
Yeah 			
True there is a lot of very good cricket coming up in			
Sharjah back in India and of course down under for a few			
month 			
The Indian Eleven led by Mohammad Azharuddin Ravi Shastri			
Shrikant will be seen back Dilip Vengasarkar Kapil Dev who			
 has 			
such a scintillating performance in the past five days			
Everybody must be looking forward to see him perform again 			
Manjrekar and Tendulkar the dynamic duo from Maharashtra			
Manoj Prabhakar Kirmani is back but unfortunately he			
doesn't			
find a place in the Indian twenty-two announced yesterday			
Arshad Ayub and Venkatpathi Raju providing the local 			
flavour 			
And one of the many fine buildings Hyderabad can be proud			
of			
Legislative Assembly 			
So we would be seeing it during the match very often 			
But here is the Pakistani Eleven led by Amir Malik 			
wi wicket keeper Jahur Ilahi young			
brother of			
Mansur 			
Mansur Rana who happened to be the son of Shakur Rana one			
of			
the leading umpires of Pakistan			
Shahid Saeed Gafar Kazmi Mansur Ilahi another very			
experienced player Suheil Fazal Javed Hayat Zakir			
Khan and Tanvir			
Mehadi will wear the brunt of the medium pace bowling and 			
Sajjad 			
Akbar 			
The drop man Mujahir Jamshid who did very well in the under			
nineteen sometime ago 			
There was some delay in knowing the exact uh content of the			
Pakistan Eleven but we are glad that all the players are now			
here though some			
of them have arrived very late			
But uh of course cricket loving public of Hyderabad and of			
India in general are glad that uh the full contingent			
has arrived in			
time 			
Mansur Ilahi getting a liitle bit of batting in 			
And uh near at the V I P stand 			
A lot of hard work has gone in to make sure that this match			
was held 			
Ravi I believe Mohammad Azharuddin won the toss and has			
elected to field 			
So we will see some Pakistani batting first 			
Mansur Ilahi would be looking forward to give another			
scintillating			
display 			
I remember couple of performances in the Middle East where he			
did			
 uh exceedingly well some years ago 			
But uhm thereafter I think he has been sort of in and out			
really 			
Yeah 			
So he is a very explosive batsman and a very useful medium			
pacer because I think one day cricket has given rise to uh 			
to uh an			
increasing number of alrounders where if you fail with one			
 then you			
can certainly try and uh get into the limelight with the			
other 			
Charu I think			
I hear a section of the crowd still picking up actually			
still early in the day but thats by mid-day we do hope to see a			
a stadium			
 full 			
Here are the two umpires doing duty for the match 			
Ramaswamy nearer us and behind him Shivram 			
The capacity of the stadium is around uh twenty-five			
thousand			
ordinarily but I think it has been uh bolstered a bit by uh			
additional stand 			
So yes we do have a full house we can expect upto			
thirty-five			
thousand people 			
Both the teams were earlier introduced to the Chief Minister			
with the chief guest Mr N Janardan Reddy a very staunch			
supporter of			
sports 			
And in his uh tenure already we had some very major events			
in			
Hyderabad particularly as you were mentioning earlier Ravi			
the pre-			
olympic football tournament two months ago 			
And as you had mentioned the stadium received a complete 			
face-lift 			
And the facility is added particularly for the players and			
uh			
 others nearer the pavilion are now almost world			
class			
Which is very good for any venue really 			
True and being from Hyderabad I can only add that the A P			
government has left no stone unturned to make sure that uh the			
finest			
possible facilities uh have been incorporated into the			
stadium 			
Which had been languishing for a number of years I think it was			
uh a basically in the year nineteen sixty-one or thereabout 			
and since			
then not much had been done			
So the pre-Olympic Football was a big boon for sportslover in			
Hyderabad 			
See because unfortunately although we have the benefit of this			
beautiful breeze that you just mentioned I think uh further			
down in the			
ground it may not be uh particularly heavy at this point of			
time			
So it would be very hard through the day			
And October is uhm not the coldest month in Hyderabad 			
It can get awfully hot but if the cloud cover does take up			
bit			
during the day then in fact in the later half we will get			
better playing			
conditions 			
True			
To remind you once again this will be a forty-five over a side			
match 			
The timings are uh well nine thirty really but I guess 			
it's about to begin 			
There will be a forty-five minute lunch break and the match will			
resume at one fifteen till the end of play 			
The Indian team taking the field Arshad Ayub at front 			
led			
of course by the captain Azharuddin who had a very			
successful season			
 for Derbyshire in the English county cricket league 			
Most of the Summer			
No he is a batsman for all seasons I don't think there is any			
search of any occasion were uh 			
The batting being open for Pakistan by their captain Amir Malik			
also very useful opener and to his right in the green cap			
 a county			
cricket cap Jahur Ilahi who is Mansur's younger			
brother 			
And to remain in contention for the match fourteen 			
at			
this age is really a very fitting tribute to his uh 			
physical prowess			
 and of course his speed and effective diving behind the			
wicket but 			
like I mentioned earlier its a trifle disappointing in			
one way to not			
see him in the twenty-two probable announced yesterday 			
Uhm and I am sure he must be very disappointed particularly 			
The selection is is not an easy job at any time and I am			
sure			
the selectors must know what they are doing			
 Meri khyal hai 			
I think Kirmani is at an age almost where he might			
qualify as a selector 			
 Jee haan 			
Jahur Ilahi all set 			
He will be the non-striker 			
And to open the innings Jahur			
Amir			
Amir Malik beg your pardon who is also the captain			
And to open the Indian bowling Manoj Prabhakar 			
Only one slip to begin with Dilip Vengasarkar 			
Slightly dangerous way to begin that edge carrying 			
quite			
safely the second slip which of course didn't exist 			
The ball stopped at the boundary by Kanwaljit Singh			
who is also now a Hyderabad Ranji regular 			
And two runs to Amir 			
Manoj Prabhakar seeing the necessity of the second slip 			
brings			
one on 			
There we have Kirmani behind the stumps 			
Vengasarkar as uh first slip Venkatpathy Raju being			
brought in as a second slip 			
Arshad Ayub seen here with Manoj Prabhakar Ayub is at			
mid			
off 			
 That's a nice ball 			
A very useful swing bowler Manoj Prabhakar particularly			
proving himself in Pakistan sometime ago 			
And a very good run 			
Another out swinger all four yes swinging out 			
Ravi if I am not mistaken I think uh uh Manoj's 			
important weapon is his inswinger which he swing by a yard			
on occasions			
uh in keeping that in a bit of check right now 			
It has been 			
Yes like on that occasion 			
Wide of the crease a little faster action and quite a			
classic inswinger 			
Of course that one didn't swing too much 			
That is record twenty-eight years old not a young been taken any			
more 			
Debut way back eight years ago 			
End of a useful over 			
A quiet beginning two run from the board for the Pakistan			
Eleven 			
The two men in for Pakistan Amir Malik their captain and			
wicket keeper and Jahur Ilahi the younger brother of Mansur			
 who will			
now take strike against Kapil Dev 			
I think the media has been full of praise for Kapil 			
Dev's			
 uh incredible performance in the Irani trophy 			
Of course it is uh a team game so the whole team should get			
the			
credit but Kapil Dev is bringing out yet another magnificient			
performance			
with the ball and with the bat 			
Ravi were you there in Faridabad when this was going on 			
Yes same as old			
And a hundred and seventy-five brilliant runs uh way back			
in the world cup 			
Zimbabwe unnees sau triyasi 			
True and we were 			
 Jab Bharat ne vishwa cup jeeta			
 			
We have got some very low score for five when he went in			
 resolute thirty or some such thing			
Quite an incredible fight like that			
Five for forty-three is his best bowling performance 			
Thirteen years of International cricket 			
Now that is a very loose loose enough way down the leg			
side 			
But even Kapil Dev uh can have situations like			
that			
Kirmani I think caught by surprise having to try way to his			
left 			
Just about collected the ball 			
So a wide one more to the Pakistani Eleven 			
I think the laces may be to blame them tying them again			
And Kanwaljit Singh an offspinner for the Hyderabadi			
Ranji squad 			
For Kapil Dev also two slip 			
Dilip Vengasarkar maintaining first slip position and 			
captain Azharuddin at the second 			
I think that one was not a milimetre away from the central			
stump because played well forward so no danger 			
In the second over the Pakistani Eleven three for no			
loss			
Back foot into the covers Shrikant 			
Jahur Ilahi opens his account with a break 			
Manoj at third man gives only a single and that			
brings Amir Malik onto the strike 			
Amir Malik on two Jahur Ilahi on two one wide 			
and			
the total five 			
I beg your pardon Jahur Ilahi has three to his credit 			
A bit of lift on that ball and Amir seeing it well in			
time let it go through 			
And Kapil Dev too sort of angling through his first over 			
Two slip another young Hyderabadi doing some duty for			
the fielding side Noel David is now brought in at			
third place 			
Little change in the fielding Shrikant moved to point man			
in the covers Kanwaljit Singh mid on 			
Down the leg side and Kapil completes his first over 			
Gentle nothing spectacular especially one as a who in			
one is a battle squad thirty-two 			
Yeah 			
The field for Manoj Prabhakar two slip four men on the			
off side third man point cover and mid off and			
three men on			
the on mid on mid wicket and fine leg 			
Oh gone for four 			
I think Jahur played inside the line expecting may be uh uh a			
bigger swing but the ball pass straightning up the just a			
bit and			
catching the off stump 			
Jahur Ilahi the first casualty for Pakistan and Ravi here			
it			
is again 			
 In Hindi 			
Its here in the loudspeaker on here somewhere laughter			
But a very good ball 			
And uh Jahur Ilahi I think more just beaten by the pace 			
very			
quick ball 			
Next man in Mansur Rana 			
Its right up Mansur gets the thirty-sixth outside			
edge I don't think that was plan to go but it did 			
I beg your pardon that's a Gaffar Kazmi we			
had Mansur Rana in our list 			
So that is Gaffar Kazmi now at the non-striker end 			
having got in a single off the first ball he played 			
Amir Malik minor change in field placing Venkatpathy			
Raju			
being brought in at third slip 			
That well guided Kanwaljit is third man and Amir			
gets single 			
 That's a real inswinger but uh way out way down			
the leg side so not much scope for damage there 			
But the kind of the the amount of swing that we were talking			
about earlier I mean he quite did it 			
Slightly unusual in one day cricket we have three slips 			
Uh that's a crackling drive of the front foot through			
the			
covers four runs 			
We will have to beg your pardon one more time that is the			
Pakistani paceman Zakir Khan in the green cap on the left now			
Credited with that for now uh you will have to excuse us the			
Pakistanis did come in at a very late stage and this is not			
exactly their			
regular eleven 			
But as the match goes on I am sure uh we will all be far			
more			
comfortable about players 			
Twelve for one at the completion of three overs 			
Kapil Dev coming in again 			
For him now two slip 			
Noel David back at point little point 			
Amir Malik 			
Malik picks the quick single inspite Noel David rushing in			
Still early in the inning so thats some good understanding			
and			
good running 			
Thats Noel David youngster now becoming a teacher in the			
Hyderabad Ranji team 			
Azharuddin lot of responsibility in his shoulders			
 on his shoulders in the coming months			
So far uh declared captain for the Sharjah and the			
India			
Pak one day series to be held in India 			
Later in uh when does it begin now November isn't it ?			
Yeah 			
Zakir Khan carefully to midoff and I think Zakir will			
get uh to his own stuff when they go into ball 			
One heard a lot about him in in in 			
uh for the year having gone by but uh he hasn't really			
become a			
regular feature of the Pakistani squad so far 			
 Iska matlab Imran Khan Wasim Akram Salim			
Jafar Waqur Yunus 			
 Waqur Yunus 			
Waqur Yunus 			
Lot of despair 			
Aquib Javed 			
True a run from fine leg 			
Ayub doing fielding 			
Arshad incidently has done a lot of organisational work in this			
match 			
Yeah 			
I think some credit that this match is being held must go to			
Arshad 			
In and out of the Indian team for the past few years			
unfortunately			
 particularly for his uh region or fans in Hyderabad			
Out good work by Kirmani diving way to his right 			
picked up the ball from the front of uh 			
First slip			
First slip and Amir Malik trudging back to the pavilion			
The second wicket down for the Pakistani Eleven with			
just			
about what's the score now ?			
Fourteen			
Fourteen runs on the board 			
A very good afternoon to all our viewers from us here at the			
Karnatak State Billiards Association match for 			
The last and final session of the world under twenty-one 			
snooker championship is about to commence 			
And the man you see on your screens is Ronie O'Salavan of			
England fifteen year old who has established a dominating nine			
frames to four uhm lead in this finals 			
 It's the best of twenty-one so he has to win just			
two more frames to win the world under twenty-one 			
snoo snooker crown 			
His opponent who you see on your screen now is Patrick Yelston			
of Belgium sixteen years old who is has 			
uh amazed everyone with his tremendous sporting ability and is			
 is in happy temperament 			
Ronie Salavan on the first session of this match which was held			
yesterday just managed to get into a four frame to three lead 			
But this morning in the second session of the match he was			
virtually unstoppable winning four out of the five frames that 			
 was was were played 			
And the centre piece of this morning session was a marvellous			
break of a hundred and thirty-one total clearance except for the black			
Uh that what you saw that was a mis clue for Ronie 			
O'Salavan 			
And uh he is uhm it's it's a bit			
 it's a bit humid out there although the air			
conditioning is on in the hall			
 It's a bit humid and possibly uh that was the 			
reason for that mis cue 			
Now let's see here 			
His opponent does well his opponent hasn't done much in fact			
 he's left the red hanging over the corner pockets the			
left corner pocket on your screen 			
The black is clear so if Salavan can put this with a			
ton of stunt which he has done 			
He can set himself up for a useful opening break 			
 There's a contrast in styles between these two players			
with O'Salavan uhm certainly I would say the more gifted of			
the two also being the more thoughtful of the two			
And I think that that is the right approach 			
Snooker is not a game which you can really uh play with any			
degree of carelessness 			
You can play of course but you have to be careful and I think			
this is the difference between Ronie Salavan and his Belgium			
opponent 			
Certain loose reds open 			
And uh O'Salavan can take a heavy toll of his			
 opponent's careless safety shot cough 			
Wondering if there is plant on after us black which is			
going to Salavan 			
A plant is a shot where you pick the first rid hit			
it on to the second rid and make second rid travel into the pocket 			
 It's a charge 			
That was a beautiful shot applause 			
He brought out the pink and he has now sink it in the			
centre pocket and come back towards this end of the table 			
And position for any of the open rids on the right hand 			
right hand side of the screen that is the one he's come for now			
is next to the pink spot 			
From where we are seating in the commentators box it seems as			
if that red his might not be free or yes it is 			
 it is free only it doesn't look like from this angle			
And here's his chance to put the blue and turn it			
into the cluster of edge to open them up 			
 That's not exactly what he had intended 			
But I think may be useful forty-five break			
Perhaps he will now opt for a safe shot 			
Sending the ball towards the bob cushion applause 			
So that's got to Ronie Salavan with a good break			
of forty-five 			
Nothing to play except safer 			
 It's the one word shot extraordinary and			
lovely hand between if the ball has enough run in it 			
Uhm that's the kind of thing that Yelston who			
want to avoid if he has any hope of getting back into this match 			
Cannot afford to play careless shots and open up the edge to an			
opponents who's playing in a good form 			
Will you agree with that Arvind ?			
Definitely but at the moment the way he has played			
that rid it might have been a shot to nothing shot whether he 			
took a wild swing			
He has gone back to the bottom of the table 			
So he may not have just a intellect to pot it 			
He might have intended to pot it as well as end up towards the			
bottom because the ball had sufficient run in it 			
Anyway a shot that is being played now by Salavan leaves			
him a red which is reasonably easy for his potting skill 			
And now this will show whether the young man is going for his			
 game or whether he's going to be play playing			
 KG 			
He can pot to brown in the corner pocket or snooker in behind the			
brown 			
 He's slumped didn't had a good follower 			
He knows that though his opponent has got forty points			
ahead and may be he can possibly make up his by sneaking 			
well few points 			
 Well 			
That was a very good shot 			
But 			
His intention in that particular shot was to play it with a			
lot of left hand spin to take the ball off the cushion closer to the blue			
so that the blue could be potted in the centre pocket 			
But he hit it so hard that the spin didn't really have time to			
react 			
Anyway he did a marvellous job in that uh clean pot on the			
blue ball 			
He just landed it in into the bottom			
pocket 			
He is attempting a similar shot now in the corner pocket now 			
May be worry of uh his waist coat or his sleeve touching			
the yellow he played that in very much of hurry and missed it 			
And that's the first decent uh opening 			
Salvan has really left this shot with that careless shot for he			
should have easily potted that rid 			
Uh now the Bel Belgium 			
player definitely should level scores or go further because all the			
reds are in a position that he can manoveur them open 			
And he has opened out one red comfortably except that			
he has to play it with the rest because he might not be able to reach it			
being a left hander 			
There again he went to playing with the rest with his right			
hand instead of now the normal left hand that he uses to play his uh 			
a inactive pots 			
Going for the pink ball clean as a whistle follows without			
those two reds 			
Now left on with the red in the centre 			
Very well done 			
Perfectly in position for the pink 			
A soft stunt loosen the a red into the corner 			
Perfectly in position for the black 			
And this is uh said for certain viewers viewing this game 			
on your black and white screens 			
A frame which should have uh for all practical purposes 			
gone to Ronie Salavan is now coming back towards the Belgium 			
player 			
 There's no place for the black ball to be spotted on his			
own spot			
The red is occupying the black spots uh blacks' area			
 and as such is been the black still spotted on the yellow spot			
Now beautiful shot there and he is right in possession for			
that ball applause 			
Break of thirty-five which puts him five points ahead of uh 			
 Ronie's score 			
Uh ah applause beautiful shot he played well for			
remaining position for the blue 			
He might even attempt the black because he got the angle to come up			
comfortably 			
That was a very hard shot that he played on the black but the			
ball didn't really travel as much as he wanted to 			
 He's done a damn good practice of play that 			
damn good shot on that actually he could have uh this was a careless			
shot because he couldn't reach and he played a haphazard shot 			
 It's a pity that after that I think that that he			
should have played this shot over reaching with the rest and giving			
Salavan a chance to uh get back straight away 			
Of course as you can see the yellow is tied against the 			
cushion the bob cushion 			
And uh it will require some effort to to pot it in			
position uh correctly for the green 			
Well I think Salavan has done quite well to get where he is and			
he can stun it off the bob cushion 			
And I'm sure that Yelston must be kicking himself			
right there because he could have wrapped up this frame if he had just			
taken a few seconds more over that safety shot 			
Now this is a crunch ball the green he can get this 			
It has come a little too much for Salavan has to use the			
wrist 			
One point behind 			
Yes indeed applause 			
Ronie Salavan has tasted blood and he wants to get this match			
over as quickly as possible 			
So he's now gone into the lead by three points 			
he needs the blue and the pink to wrap up the frame 			
Oh that's it applause before two frames of			
the match and the first frame of the last session has gone O'Salavans'			
 way			
 He's now just one frame away from winning the			
under twenty-one world snooker championship 			
And uh there you see Yelston with his left hand over his			
eyes			
 I'm sure he's rueing that rather dreadful			
safety shot 			
Uh looking a bit dejected but that's only to			
be expected			
If he had to have any sort of chance of getting back into this			
match it was important for him to win this first frame and he certainly			
had an outstanding opportunity of doing so that as we said before			
 that hasty shot cost him the frame 			
Well he is off some of the yes and now beautiful first our			
view of the whole arena very handsome arena 			
The Karnataka State Billiards Association is very fortunate in			
having its own premises and having such a wonderful match room 			
where the scores of the famous that's been played in the			
final 			
First sessions score as you can see on the board 			
thirty-nine sixty-two loosing the first frame and uh 			
subsequently twenty-four seventy three 			
The scores actually are the other way round 			
Uh some of them have gone 			
Yes there's the scores are quite right because it			
was 			
No the scores			
Yeah you are right you are right 			
First two frames were taken by Yelston 			
 Yesterday's score 			
 Yesterday's score 			
Not todays' first sessions' but 			
yesterday's and then it was uh Salavan who got that got			
the 			
Yelston has just broken up for the fifteenth frame			
of the match and should he loose this of course young Ronie			
fifteen year old Ronie O'Salavan will be the nineteen			
ninety-one world under twenty-one snooker champion 			
Feels extremely the pity but uh there is an applause			
that brilliant shot on the last but one red 			
Fouled uh spoiled his safety shot and what could			
have been very interesting match is now going to be possibly 			
Salavans uh very easy manner now that the fight is obviously out of			
Yelston applause 			
He has tied our equation and and it is			
great but as such			
No doubt about it 			
Now let's see what what he does I mean he is			
quite remarkable this man 			
For his adolescent as I should call him being sixteen years old			
 sixteen years of age 			
Looking for the plant and trying to slam it now			
this was the shot which uh if played a little carefully could have			
uh brought him back very much into the game 			
But the way he is has burst the			
back he's still not run left Ronie a little easy on this			
 He's lost the black alright and if Ronie goes for			
this last set of the screen on your left hand side as you see or the 			
one level black spot the second one 			
 That's the one I mean and he's got it well			
If he gets that now that he's got this a colour 			
bringing him back up the table will probably put that to any			
sort of a challenge that the Belgian might have had in mind 			
With all those reds spread out on the table it looks like a			
Christmas tree and uh here O'Salavan his now in a in a			
difficult position because he's right on the cushion and 			
he's attempting a slice which he has got in fact and uh 			
this must be uh well			
 Two words 			
So not much damage done uh from Yelston's point			
of view uh as a result of that wide slash that he took at the red			
 applause 			
Round of applause for getting himself out of that self			
imposed snooker 			
Ronie O'Salavan five Patrick Yelston six 			
And as I said before O'Salavan needing just this			
frame to win the title 			
Now well planned safety shot but he got the edge on			
that rid still didn't uh remain in the centre area 			
However the long pot was won and it was played well by 			
Patrick Yelston 			
This is again an opening from which the Belgian can make 			
a good number of points that depends whether he can muster up all			
the guts that are required to face a situation like this 			
Provided he doesn't get a rush of blood to the head and do			
something silly 			
You know it's uh is quite possible because 			
you've seen him break down on the easiest of shots 			
This is the longest that he has take 			
taken to plan a break if you noticed Mike 			
Yes same stroke that strike me I must confess 			
First time we've seen him thinking so much 			
Uh this is just just he stress at that 			
Actually what happens when a person is a very fast player			
 tries to think and play a slow game 			
His reflexes are fast his uh brain muscle coordination is			
fantastic and uh he doesn't have the ability to cope to the			
slower situation that he has to at times plan and do 			
So the score is Patrick Yelston twenty-two Ronie 			
O'Salavan five with with this break in hand 			
And it certainly could be by the looks of it uhm a			
winning situation 			
All the reds are spread out fairly easily fairly comfortably			
and 			
Just needs to keep his cool and the rest will fall on place			
Brushing some of the dust away from the area of the pink			
 must have felt that there is something which might obstruct the few			
balls around 			
The following up for the black off a cushion black ball on			
the spot comfortably to go round off a cushion 			
 In Hindi 			
Bidhan Nagar in attack 			
To Sanjoy Mitra Sanjoy Das the captain is looking at			
the box but referee waves play on 			
Bidhan Nagar playing the three mid field players three forwards			
 and five defenders 			
Sports College Lucknow attacking to Veer Bahadur Thapa 			
Now it's Rajan Kumar Kuldeep left footer 			
Comfortably collected by Vimal Das the Bidhan Nagar goal			
keeper 			
Sports College Lucknow trailing zero one in this Subrato			
Mukherjee Cup final 			
And the substitution being made by Bidhan Nagar Vimal			
 no it is Raja Chatterjee who's coming on 			
Raja Chatterjee the number thirteen who'll come on			
And coming out is the number twelve that is Santosh Gupta 			
So Raja Chatterjee will come in in the next back position 			
Bidhan Nagar in attack 			
Once again to Sanjoy Das the skipper 			
This is in the second half Bidhan Nagar leading their opponent			
Sports College Lucknow one nil in the nineteen nineteen 			
 ninety- one final 			
Bidhan Nagar has lost three nil to Sports College Lucknow 			
So if Bidhan Nagar win today it will be their first ever win in the			
Subrato Cup 			
And as their coach Surjit Kumar Ghosh said it will be sweet			
revenge for the defeat in nineteen ninety-one when they lost zero			
three to Sports College Lucknow 			
Referee Joji awards foul 			
Bidhan Nagar player pulled up for stamping and a free kick to			
Sports College Lucknow which they will take just near the centre line 			
Long high free kick but not much danger comfortably collected			
by Vimal Das the goalkeeper as he collect it 			
Bidhan Nagar in attack through Sanjoy Das their			
skipper a good through pass but it's clear for a			
corner 			
Corner kick will be taken from the far right 			
Some clearance and the ball goes into touch 			
Now Sports College Lucknow Hemchandra Joshi throwing			
the ball but losing out again 			
Bidhan Nagar skipper Sanjoy Das trying to build up an attack 			
for the off side 			
So Bidhan Nagar still clinging on to that one nil lead and if			
they maintained this lead they will have achieved their ambition of			
bringing the Subrato Cup they have been pass getting the Subrato Cup since			
nineteen ninety semi-finalist in nineteen ninety semi-finalist again			
in ninety-nine in ninteen ninety-two and runners up in nineteen			
ninety-one 			
But they have yet to win the tournament 			
Aimless football even this early part of the second half 			
Bidhan Nagar have the distinction of having reach the			
final without having conceded a goal 			
In their league matches they won ten nil thirteen nil and then			
were held cold by one word Shillong in the quarter final			
they won one nil and in the semi- final they beat the school from Ranchi			
three nil 			
Sports College Lucknow from the near right but well cleared by			
Bidhan Nagar Raja Chatterjee 			
Long clearance this could be dangerous			
A chance by Sports College Lucknow mid fielder Lalit Singh			
takes a very weak try 			
Mid field action not much constructed football and			
referee Joji giving awarding a foul to Bidhan Nagar because 			
one of Sports College Lucknow player obstructed Bidhan Nagar			
defender 			
So it's a long clearance Bidhan Nagar in attack			
 from the near left through Raja Chatterjee the overlapping left back			
 a long left footer but the ball goes obviously wide 			
Manoj Singh long high goal kick but the ball goes into			
touch on the near right 			
Still Bidhan Nagar one Sports College Lucknow nil and Kamal			
Ghosh the prolofic scorer for Bidhan Nagar scored this goal 			
Now Raja Chatterjee with the ball dribbles well attempted			
to pass but mis direction 			
Suddenly Bidhan Nagar seem to have become a bit hasty			
As time is running out they are getting anxious to hold on to			
this lead which could be long tactics because the break away move Sports			
College Lucknow could equalise 			
The ball is not of a very high quality 			
Both teams tense and anxious 			
Now this Arbind Mhatra who's cleared the ball out			
of danger for Bidhan Nagar 			
See Bidhan Nagar players lying on the ground as a results of these			
 tussles of the ball 			
And referee Joji calls up for medical assistance			
And there will be a slight hold up 			
Bidhan Nagar high school from fourth lane in Calcutta adopted			
by the sports authorities of India our leading Sports College Lucknow by			
one nil			
Both these teams met in the finals in nineteen ninety-one 			
The Sports College Lucknow won rather emphatic win three nil 			
But this time Bidhan Nagar has have the initiative 			
they have been the more dominating team but they are not really being			
able to translate their dominance into goal 			
Approach plays good but near the goal hasty passes 			
leads to impossession in attack and break up of the attack 			
So it is Bidhan Nagar Shonkar Das receiving assistance 			
medical attendant near the goal line near the goal and play will			
resume			
Referee Joji insist goal keeper goes to see him			
And there will be long goal keep goal kick			
 by Parmanand Karmakar 			
Shankor Das also leaps back onto the field 			
Now Bidhan Nagar in attack this could be dangerous but			
Komal Ghosh looked as he trys to touch the ball 			
And on the break for Sports College Lucknow is there			
 number twelve Salim Javed Salim Javed to Veer Bahudar Thapa 			
And a long aimless kick which sails over the bar 			
Lalit Rathod and Veer Bahadur Thapa were the main striker for			
Sports College Lucknow on their way to the final 			
But they have made very little impact against the tight			
marking Bidhan Nagar defence 			
Now Imad Hussein the left winger attacking for Sports			
College Lucknow takes a good returned pass attempts across but			
 is unsuccessful 			
Sports College Lucknow trying to build up attack through from the			
left to Imad Hussein 			
And Lalit Rathod with the ball solo pass but it's			
 the referee pulls up this tackle by Sanjoy Das he			
accidently handle the ball while tackling and throw a free kick 			
from a reasonably dangerous position if they have a hard hitting striker			
Sports College Lucknow could utilise this free kick quite well 			
Standing there is Vishal Prasad and Lalit Singh and let us see who			
takes it 			
Lalit Singh serving the free kick just goes over the bar			
 of course goal keeper Vimal Das has seen it well and so there was no			
danger 			
And referee waves ask for play to resume 			
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil 			
Sports College Lucknow Salim Javed losing out to Komal			
Ghosh Komal Ghosh pulled up forward for the obstruction and so Salim			
Javed will take this free kick for Sports College Lucknow 			
A wasted free kick mis directed Bidhan Nagar also now			
playing study football just long clearances in inter space 			
just trying to wind time away 			
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil			
Komal Ghosh being the scorer 			
Raja Chatterjee taking this throwing trying to get Komal Ghosh			
in action but it is the right back Amit Singh Rawat who intercepts and			
place the ball into touch 			
Yet another throwing for Bidhan Nagar 			
Referee Joji looking at his watch 			
Bidhan Nagar coming close to fulfilling their ambition good			
build up this but well foiled by Surendar Kumar 			
From the far side it is Imad Hussein building up an attack for			
Sports College Lucknow 			
The typical long pass but very well headed away by			
Bidhan Nagar Parmanand Karmakar 			
The long ball tactics of Sports College Lucknow not really 			
penetrating enough to upset the tight marking and Bidhan			
Nagar defence which intercepts very well both in the air and on the			
ground 			
Habib and Mondal now it could give Neg 			
Niyogi in the striker position 			
He steals a diagonal but displayed by Shailendra Kumar the poor			
Shailendra Kumar 			
And it is Lalit Rathod give the ball to Veer Bahadur Thapa			
 dangerous striker 			
Good ball controlled by Veer Bahadur Thapa one word 			
 takes the return pass 			
 It's the Rajan Kumar moving up but again			
misdirected by one word Bidhan Nagar defender Shankar Das to			
make a long aimless clearance 			
This tactics could misfire because on a break away Sports College			
Lucknow could equalise 			
It would be very demoralising for Bidhan Nagar 			
In the beginning they stop playing constructive football the			
type of football they are capable of playing 			
And that is formed by Sujeet Niyogi strike and you will			
see yet another substitution			
 It's number seventeen Sudeep Majumdar who is coming on			
for Bidhan Nagar so they have used first one word on team			
substitution they can of course still change their goal keeper if they want			
according to latest SEFA rule 			
And coming out is the number eight for Bidhan Nagar is			
 that is 			
And a down step Sports College Lucknow but number twelve Salim			
Javed shoot wide 			
So Sudeep Majumdar on the field the substitute to Komal Das			
Komal Ghosh from the left side 			
Komal Ghosh dribbles well and good ball control			
Komal Ghosh gives the fine smooth pass but it deflects for			
Sports College Lucknow defender and good recovery tackle 			
by their one word back Surendra Kumar which prevents danger			
Bidhan Nagar in attack but it's infringement			
and so Sports College Lucknow will get this free kick if they take from			
the near right long clearance from Amit Singh Rawat 			
The ball with Salim Javed now with Shailendra Kumar with			
Manoj Singh long clearance to Imdad Hussein attempted long pass but			
which is misdirected 			
So Bidhan Nagar playing with four defenders three mid field players			
and three forwards 			
And leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil			
Sports College Lucknow playing in the traditional four to four			
formation			
Four defenders two mid field players and four forward 			
Though one of their wingers just frequently fall back to			
help the forward line 			
Bidhan Nagar so far quite untroubled by Sports College Lucknow			
 it's long passing game and they can hold out unnecessary			
defence in one word 			
Long pass trying to get Veer Bahadur Thapa in action but			
the ball is too long to wangled for Veer Bahadur to even get near to			
it 			
Veer Bahadur Thapa of course is the prolofic dangerous			
striker for Sports College Lucknow but he has not received the service to			
which he can do justice 			
Shankar Das getting ready with a long free kick goal kick			
But doesn't find an opponent Komal Ghosh going up for the ball			
losing out to stretched out Komal Ghosh Sports College Lucknow taller			
fitter but making a tight control with the Bidhan Nagar players there 			
Now it's a good throw pass to Komal Ghosh 			
But it accidently handles the ball and there's a free			
kick to Sports College Lucknow 			
Misdirected free kick Raja Chatterjee edge but it heller			
 goes straight to Lalit Rathod Lalit Rathod to Veer Bahadur Thapa			
 who attempts the cross from the right but he doesn't reach 			
So one of the rare break away move Sports College Lucknow			
couldn't really spell any danger couldn't create any major danger 			
One more wrong high goal kick to the left side to find Komal Ghosh			
 but he is unable to attack 			
So one more aimless crappy football into aimless crappy football			
 and there will be a throwing being taken by Amit Singh Rawat the			
right back 			
Amit Singh Rawat right back trying to find Lalit Singh			
 who turns and shoot but promptly cleared by Parmanand Karmakar 			
Amit Singh Rawat 			
Now it is Raja Chatterjee pulled up for pushing Salim Javed			
from behind and so it's a foul 			
Free kick which is being taken by Lalit Singh of Sports			
College Lucknow 			
Free kick from the near right if taken accurately could			
create danger			
Three Sports College Lucknow player up in the box but			
well cleared by Shankar Das 			
A chance here for Sports College Lucknow Veer Bahadur Thapa has			
the ball 			
And now good shot by Imdad a good shot by Imad Imdad			
Hussein but which went wide gives the side one word 			
So this was the danger because what could happen Bidhan Nagar			
by being such a defensive and trying to lose out the ball and 			
on a break away move Sports College Lucknow nearly collide 			
Now it is Manoj Singh on the far side 			
But an aimless clearance by Manoj 			
Arbind Mhatra sending it to skipper Sanjoy Das who kicks			
it on to Deepak Mandol 			
Deepak Mandol controls it's a long clearance a chance			
now by Sujeet Niyogi top of the box but the ball goes to the goal			
keeper 			
Bidhan Nagar players resorting to long drives in this closing			
minutes 			
Probably content on their one goal lead and trying to waste a			
little time by taking these long rangers			
They also hope to unsettle goal keeper Abdus Salam and try			
for a rebound			
Komal Ghosh is a very nippy forward as he is darting through here			
 on the left but it is Amit Singh Rawat who gets there first and			
clear the ball into touch for a throwing to Bidhan Nagar 			
So these seems to be the tactic for Bidhan Nagar long passes 			
And now it is again Komal Ghosh but uh obstruction by the two			
Bidhan Nagar players Amit Singh Rawat and throw foul which will be taken			
by Amit Singh Rawat at right flank for Sports College Lucknow 			
Goaler goaler in yellow shirts Sports College Lucknow			
 not being able to create any cohesive attack 			
Now Bidhan Nagar developing an attack to Sujeet Niyogi Sujeet			
Niyogi a fine through pass from far right and on the far right it is			
Deepak Mandol getting control yes he dribbles but he is very			
crudely tackled and rightly gets a foul though one sense may be umpire			
Joji could have given advantage because he had managed Deepak Mandol had			
managed to dribble 			
Again Chander Joshi and the free kick now to Bidhan			
Nagar from the far right 			
A free kick uh Sports College Lucknow building up an			
attack from the near side it is to Rajan Kumar Rajan Kumar loses out			
the ball to Lalit Rathod Lalit Rathod in centre of the field 			
building up an attack with Lalit Singh back to Lalit Rathod a diagonal			
pass to the near right to Veer Bahadur Thapa 			
This could be dangerous Veer Bahadur Thapa moving up picking up			
pace dribble pass one against the form but he gets a free kick just			
outside the box if there had been a yard inside it could have been a penalty			
and could have spell danger 			
Again the break away move causing danger to Bidhan Nagar 			
Veer Bahadur Thapa certainly shows good subtle pulse and quick			
control 			
The most dangerous movement for Sports College Lucknow			
Veer Bahadur Thapa picked himself up his credit being thinking			
of himself uh a wall being formed ten yards away this is an area			
with certainly a well directed free kick could lead to a goal			
 It's a direct free kick Veer Bahadur Thapa is there 			
Rajan Kumar is there 			
 Let's see how Sports College Lucknow take this free kick			
Veer Bahadur Thapa props up and this could be a goal 			
Rajan Kumar kicks in the rebound as goal keeper Vimal Das			
didn't collected very properly 			
A crowning free kick put Vimal Das in trouble he couldn't			
control it and off the rebound it was the nippy Rajan Kumar who			
darted in that goal with the low left footer 			
Bidhan Nagar defenders should be blamed with this because they			
didn't rush back sensing their goal keeper was in danger they should			
have rushed back to help him			
One hour now and the game could go to extra time 			
Bidhan Nagar School Calcutta one Sports College Lucknow one			
now there will be greater sense of urgency in Bidhan Nagar's play			
now 			
Good afternoon 			
We have once again a very hot day here but much more still than			
it was yesterday 			
And let me start once again by welcoming my colleagues Atul			
Premnarayan Rakesh Sharma and our expert Sumant Mishra 			
Atul are you going to sweat as you did yesterday watching			
the match or in the heat ?			
Well we did all enjoy the kind of Tennis Ravi that we are going			
to watch as all the four players are going to battle out very very			
exciting doubles match after one all last evening 			
In fact the scoops of ice cream will be most popular and the scoops			
of delicious uh soft drinks round			
Soft drinks			
Let me first uh inform all the viewers who are with us today			
That there is some good news as far as India is concerned Leander			
Paes is fit and is back on the court			
He is going to partner Ramesh Krishnan in the crucial doubles			
tie 			
And uh with that uh good news with us I think 			
it's a good idea if we start with Suman than lets see what he thinks			
this match is going to be like 			
Well to begin with I noticed Leander Paes has got those			
 ankle fringe he is wearing when he went to Australia so			
 lets come to the match of one word 			
I think it's this is a crucial match although I feel			
that they have played as with the same players 			
We have a better than fifty fifty chance winning both singles			
But they will both be tough matches			
So the doubles in any case is very crucial 			
This the Koreans have seem they were good reputation 			
But they hadn't played I mean Ramesh there makes a bit			
different because he he is one of those steady players which create the			
opening and Leander has taken to finish them 			
In a good doubles team there is always one person who is very			
steady keeps getting everything opening the other finishing 			
You had the examples of John Macandro and Kan and			
Peter Flemming 			
Flemming was a mm and so anyway so I think the			
players are topping up now at the side 			
Rakesh you tell our viewers would like to hear in			
Hindi what this doubles is going to be like ?			
Well it's always a bit of psychological			
advantages uh you had a good victory behind you isn't it ?			
But on the other hand Ramesh is an extremely experience			
player with a vast number of uh victories of all kind behind him 			
I think the most important point that we might like to watch today			
is how he combines with Leander Paes 			
Uh I rather imagine that Paes is going to take the forehand 			
court Suman			
Well I just got to mention this the way they standing the			
first round they played in Jaipur about five weeks ago 			
Ramesh took the right court 			
Uh today I think they have decided so let us how this works			
out 			
I would have preferred Ramesh taking the left court because in			
 the steady player always takes the left court			
 Ramesh 			
Also I think that uh we watched yesterday that this			
tendency of Paes to block the backhand return uh can prove to be a bit			
of disadvantage in in doubles			
Because it gives a lot of time for the opponent to 			
re recoup his uh stamina or run quickly or			
get back to position quickly 			
So I would imagine that uh uh more attacking left hand court			
player is more vital aspect in this particular game 			
So we will have to see how the strategy works 			
Uh Ramesh and Leander Paes uh have played only once before			
Rakesh			
But they couldn't uh 			
Atul uh may be you would like to comment a little bit but			
I will ask you a question one possible reason for this uh strategy			
of taking the left court by Ramesh Krishnan could be that the Koreans are			
putting in a left hander 			
And therefore really they will have two right court players			
Exactly I was just going to say this Ravi 			
In fact an hour before this programme began they were practising on			
the outside courts 			
And both the Korean stars were practising only serves from the left			
court and not from the right court 			
Now Ramesh particularly from the left court has a beautiful			
backhand which he can tip chipping it very well bringing the 			
opponent close to the net			
Because the server will be at the base line and he will have to			
come up for the server volley tandum 			
Just one more thing for the viewers particularly the fact that			
Leander Paes is wearinng ankle pads today 			
He put them on almost about an hour and half back and he was			
warming up with his father on the outside courts 			
Trying it for the first time as I asked him 			
And Ramanathan Krishnan told me that the minor trouble that he had			
in the right ankle would not be a hindrance at all at this stage 			
Uhm well that we'll have to see 			
The other thing very important is the 			
India is represented by Ramesh Krishnan and Leander Paes			
 applause 			
Korea is represented by Chang Jong and Lee Chong Wo 			
applause 			
India has won the toss and elected to serve 			
Time till the pairs play 			
The umpire is coming right 			
And one of the uh interesting thing that that happen in			
this Davis Cup ties I think that India has won the toss in every match			
Haven't we so far ?			
So far			
Ramesh Krishnan won his toss Leander Paes won his 			
and now the doubles team has gone across the court 			
So Ramesh and Leander will play from the southern			
end near commentators box end and probably Ramesh will serve we			
will have to see in a minute 			
In the meanwhile once again to the uhm to the Koreans Atul			
 uh this is going to be very tough for the Indian because both the			
players will play on their forehand 			
And that's going to be uh a very much more attacking			
combination than uh the normal right handed players			
Well I think it will be very difficult for the Indian players			
to pass them particularly Ramesh 			
And uh the result that I could see yesterday in the two sets			
that they played you know really serving very very powerfully 			
And both of them with strong shoulders 			
Both the Korean stars were reintroduce but they were one word			
And Leander now is ready to serve 			
The first service of the match crucial match important			
match			
I hope this can excite us 			
And Leander ready to serve 			
Love fifteen 			
Very good volley there but rather unlucky			
Yes 			
Bit too long 			
He played the shot and Leander he saw the ball all the way to			
 saw Chang move 			
And he was really good to chase that volley quite easily to an			
empty court fifteen O 			
Oh 			
Fifteen O 			
Another service take Chang goes there flack backhand			
 down the line no mistakes at all 			
Fifteen O 			
Very confidently played by Leander			
Thirty O 			
He was back quick waiting for the volley 			
Very good display at the match 			
Ankle doesn't seem to be bothering him			
Yes 			
Seems to be running alright 			
Thirty O 			
Forty thirty 			
The first time in the game Leander has gotten on to a lead 			
forty thirty a good service			
Serving wide on forehand 			
Very easy smash for Ramesh Krishnan forty thirty first			
game 			
Leander forty 			
A very good beginning for India no Suman 			
But I like the way uh Leander change over to the forehand			
got them on the forehand because one word been consisted in			
being serving on the backhand 			
But now when he won four and forty more 			
The other point I think is important Korean going to do a lot			
of interceptions 			
You know self systems particularly			
So let it will depend on the Indian service return also			
how			
What do you think of that very brave shot by Chang ?			
Oh he's good			
I thought that was a good shot			
He he he came took the ball on the rise and hit a flak down the			
line edge 			
He got a good tactic good shot I mean he not the 			
these are the player sort of Ramesh is trying to cut off he wanted			
to keep it down 			
In the beginning you try all those all such things			
I don't think he will try			
But that try that as this thirty all or so towards the			
end of the 			
May I we'll have to see whether it can be bad			
attacking that bold as the games along but 			
Fine 			
The position at the moment is that India started serving			
the match 			
The doubles match first game 			
Leander Paes and Krishnan are representing India 			
And Chang and Lee are representing Korea in this very vital			
doubles match this afternoon at the D L T A court 			
India has won the first game			
Leander Paes held the service after winning the toss 			
And now Chang serves to Paes 			
Chang of Korea to serve 			
Fifteen love 			
Oh that was that was a necessarily pass somewhat in			
touch was there have a look there 			
A nice return by Krishnan 			
Paes could have done anything with that in in the event he			
 steady infatuates put it wide outside the baseline 			
A bit sure zoom for the rather unnecessary lapse 			
They really dropped that return a good return			
Chang couldn't do anything there 			
So it's thirty fifteen to Korea 			
Chang serving to Ramesh 			
Forty fifteen			
Uh Ravi did you notice this time when Chang was to serve			
 Lee the right hander non-playing hand put it behind and held up			
a couple of singles which shows that they are going to run across for singles			
Yes it's it's a sort of 			
You know signal			
A signal 			
A private signal system 			
A very pretty shot by Lee 			
In fact that return very beautifully 			
Make Tennis look so easy like that doesn't it ?			
In fact these are very difficult shots 			
So it's one game all			
First two games had been held by the server Leander Paes won			
his first game 			
Chang gave in the same performance 			
One O first set in doubles tie 			
Fifteen down 			
Now there it seems to be some kind of misunderstanding			
I thought Lee want to get couldn't get it slipped Chang ran			
 almost got it but the net intercept intercepted that 			
So Ramesh won the point 			
Already tension is showing 			
And there goes another gushing out 			
Suman this is the fourth time in laughs since			
yesterday			
As you have mentioned little while line called for might			
 wo wo wo uh would you see why Chang			
miss that shot 			
Why ?			
The ball was low near the net			
Yes 			
And both the Indians had covered up the cross court			
Right 			
So he thought of going down the line			
Going down the line			
But but he can't run raise it so near the net 			
You can't you can't have these totally inexplicable			
errors while you getting too tense uh tense I think 			
His serve stop by the net 			
He anticipated that 			
Rather good drive rather good sense			
Have a look there 			
Leander intercepts Chang hits another nice shot 			
Krishnan stretches and makes it into a win 			
Oh another lovely shot by Krishnan there 			
A beautiful shot 			
Good return and better volley 			
An excellent return by Lee and even better volley by			
Krishnan			
Look at that good flak return by Lee 			
And Krishnan stretches out meets a nice big volley 			
And he puts it into the net 			
Krishnan there serving over game 			
Game is over India leads two games to one 			
Perfect 			
But although India has led has won this game and leading			
two games to one 			
I think we got to come back to those two point which uh 			
Leander Paes seems to have missed up very early in the match			
He he hit one volley up which was quite unnecessary and that			
 very interesting smash			
 It's improvising 			
 I'm is it is it already the nerves catching up			
with him 			
No I think he is trying to prove himself that he he just			
trying to overdo it which is sometimes nerves 			
It won't be nerves he has played in this tournament 			
particularly doubles before 			
But here I think he is trying to prove a point and trying			
to finish off too soon 			
Now both both the shots were inex in 			
inexplicable those errors particularly second one when he got so			
near the net 			
What and the point is that he has to cool down a little			
bit because this is going to be a long game probably 			
And uh if you stretch on to three or four hours of Tennis			
 on a hot day like this you have to keep your cool more than anything			
else I think			
 Haan definitely I mean he he can't			
afford to make those those errors because uh af 			
 after a great an open you got a shot like this it is			
a gift			
Yeah and uh as Ramesh keeps the young lad in check			
 comment by Suman and then to Rakesh Sharma 			
Well I won't call that's a lead they are just			
holding around because holding services 			
Quite please quite please 			
 Two words Leander Paes 			
A very warm and enthusiastic crowd 			
Greeting the performance of the two Indian players Ramesh			
Krishnan and Leander Paes 			
And facing the camera on the far side the Korean number one			
star Chang Jong Ta 			
Fifteen love 			
Ah you notice Atul 			
Yes 			
That the Korean supporters are in greater numbers today			
And with their flags waving there sitting out on the west end 			
Very true			
West end yeah

just about three minutes of play gone 			
there was one attacking move by the Kerala team 			
a very good crowd here 			
the stadium built to accomodate around thirty thousand spectators			
say for a few bare spots in the Northern and Southern stands			
 it's almost full 			
Kerala with the ball now 			
Hamid

Kerala and Maharashtra meeting for the ninth time in the Santosh

controls it very well 			
Vijayan still in possession 			
moving forward there 			
Santosh 			
Tride a shot just outside the penalty area but wide off the			
mark 			
some excitement among the spectators 			
a goal-kick for Maharashtra 			
Mohammad Kadir

Soccer Series 			
and here is the scoreline 			
after about five minutes of play in the first half Kerala zero			
 Maharashtra zero 			
Maharashtra get a free-kick 			
just near the centre line 			
Everesto Cardoz the skipper

Godfrey Pereira 			
and a corner-kick for Maharashtra 			
the first corner-kick in this match 			
coming in about the sixth minute of play 			
Akeel Ansari 			
placing the ball 			
here is the kick 			
and uh goalkeeper Shivadatt collects it neatly 			
Shivadatt was not very sure in the semi-final against Goa			
he let in uh three goals under pressure 			
but he's got good experience 			
he was the goalkeeper in the last years Kerala team			
also for the Santosh trophy 			
here is a move by Maharashtra			
Manoj Bhatt 			
all by himself 			
a tackle there 			
Hamid looses out to Godfrey Pereira 			
but uh Pereira being pulled up there by referee Samil for			
obstructing Hamid 			
and here is a shot at the V I P gallery 			
the president of the All India Football Federation it's			
 Priyaranjan Das Munshi alongwith the secretary of the All India			
Football Federation P B Lakshmanan 			
and that is Ashok Ghosh to the extreme right of your screen 			
the former secretary of the All India Football Federation 			
Kerala building up a move through the right flank now 			
that is Suresh Kumar being dispossessed 			
Shanti Kumar 			
to Arif Ansari 			
Maharashtra on the move 			
but a mispass there 			
taken away by Vijayan 			
to Santosh 			
Vijayan again the captain 			
jersey number eight 			
trying to find a forward there but Hashim the central striker			
 didn't read that pass very well 			
and uhm Mohammed Kadir now the Maharashtra goalkeeper 			
has had a fine outing in this tournament so far 			
to Manoj Bhatt 			
snatched away by Vijayan			
now Santosh putting through Vijayan 			
but there's Jarcinto de Silva 			
Manoj Bhatt doesn't keep the ball in play 			
now throw-in for Kerala 			
Joseph 			
Santosh 			
 he's got two defenders there 			
that is Jarcinto clearing the ball 			
a very good crowd here 			
for perhaps the best turnout in this tournament so			
far 			
throw-in for Kerala 			
Joseph the left wing-back to take the throw-in 			
the referee asking that uh to be taken again 			
or rather 			
he is awarded a free-kick just near the corner flag 			
a short pass there comes to Vijayan 			
a free-kick again 			
this time in favour of Maharashtra 			
Shanti Kumar now 			
looses out 			
to Suresh Kumar 			
but a tightly packed Maharashtra defence 			
is quite strong in that department 			
Everesto Cardoz the captain playing in the defence today			
this is how Kerala progressed to the final 			
in the quarter-final league they drew Madhya-Pradesh zero-zero			
 then beat Uttar-Pradesh four-zero 			
then beat the Bengal three-one Andhra_Pradesh three-zero 			
and in the semi-final they got past Goa by four goals to three 			
Vijayan now in possession for Kerala 			
Jarcinto there allowed the ball to run over the sidelines			
teams yet to settle down here 			
trying to find openings 			
 here's Jarcinto de Silva to Akeel Ansari 			
Arif Ansari now 			
to Shanti Kumar who doesn't trap it neatly 			
Santosh now for Kerala 			
that is back-heel there 			
taken by the Maharashtra player 			
Manoj Bhatt 			
to Godfrey Pereira 			
Pereira cutting in on the right flank 			
being tackled and brought down 			
A good spot smarting up a women's spectator			
 here in the stadium this afternoon 			
and uh a free-kick for Maharashtra 			
Manoj Bhatt the linkman to take the kick 			
four players Maharashtra players inside the box 			
the ball deflecting off Vijayan and going out 			
for a 			
 it's going to be another free-kick 			
or rather a kick being awarded to Kerala 			
these teams have met nine times earlier in this 			
championship and it's been Kerala who have won five times			
the other matches ending in draws 			
some excitement at the Kerala half 			
 that's a shot at the Kerala bench 			
their coach K K Gopalakrishnan was a member of the Kerala team			
 played in 1966 			
Kerala with the ball now 			
Rasheed 			
long ball to Hashim 			
Santosh now in possession 			
Maharashtra defence regrouping very well a good ball here for			
Harshan 			
inside the penalty area 			
but there're two defenders there to take care of			
Harshan Everesto Cardoz and Jarcinto de Silva 			
and uh this is the progress chart of Maharashtra to the final			
in the quarter-final league they drew Karnataka one-all beat			
Punjab one-zero then beat Assam four-one and in the final			
quarter-final league beat Goa one-zero 			
in the semi-final they got past a fancied Bengal by one goal to			
nil a goal scored by Shanti Kumar 			
Rasheed now for Kerala 			
chip into the penalty area there headed out by Everesto Cardoz 			
and after about uh fifteen minutes of play come in Baldev			
Sachdeva 			
so the play about to resume now after a slight hold-up 			
goalkeeper Mohammad Kadir and Everesto Cardoz going for that ball			
 and in the clash Cardoz had fallen down and now the 			
game resumes again 			
Kerala now building up an attack through the right flank 			
Harshan going for that ball 			
but doesn't control it well it goes off a defender 			
Ashok Nair and it's going to be a corner-kick for Kerala			
about two thirty-two minutes of play gone in the first half 			
neither team have scored yet 			
Kerala is better as far as attacks are concerned 			
that uh kick hitting Ashok Nair and it's 			
going to be a free-kick for Kerala 			
a good chance here for Kerala to open the score 			
that was a good intelligent kick taken there by Jiju Jacob			
but equally well deflected by Manoj Bhatt for a corner 			
yet another one for Kerala 			
the goalkeeper Kadir doesn't gathered that one 			
but Maharashtra keep possession Akeel Ansari 			
Santosh now for Kerala 			
trying to put through Vijayan there 			
ball running loose 			
to Sabu 			
he tries a left-footer from around thirty yards a rather weak			
shot 			
nothing much here for the crowd to enthuse 			
Only mild flutter was provided by Hashim in the eighteenth			
minute 			
a good ball put through by Jiju which found him 			
with only the goalkeeper to beat and he shot wide 			
now here's a chance for Maharashtra Godfrey Pereira 			
centring that one 			
but way over the goalline 			
Kerala entering the final of the Santosh trophy for the forth			
consecutive time 			
three times runners-up from nineteen eighty-eight onwards 			
and the crowd here are hoping that it would be forth time lucky			
for Kerala 			
Kerala in possession now 			
ball there for Vijayan 			
Harshan in control here 			
good chance and he puts it over the goal 			
both the Maharashtra defenders Everesto Cardoz and Jarcinto 			
didn't mark him there and Harshan there you see him jersey number eleven			
 had a good chance 			
a snap move by Kerala there Harshan all by himself 			
with the defenders trying to regroup 			
he tackled the ball well but then his left-footer sailing			
over the bar 			
so yet another chance going abegging as far as Kerala			
is concerned 			
they have done most of this attacking in this match so			
far 			
now Everesto Cardoz the Maharashtra captain who played for			
India in the Nehru Gold Cup giving it to Shanti Kumar 			
ball taken away by Vijayan 			
Jarcinto de Silva now for Maharashtra 			
to Manoj Bhatt 			
to Arif Ansari			
good ball down the right flank 			
and the Kerala defence quite tight there 			
marking the Maharashtra player and uh 			
they earn a free-kick 			
Hamid the stopper-back 			
looking for an unmarked player 			
headed out by Jarcinto 			
Harshan being put through on the right flank 			
ball again deflecting off the Maharashtra wall 			
Suresh Kumar now for Kerala 			
Hashim tightly marked 			
Cardoz with a clearance 			
Arif Ansari 			
trying to put through Godfrey Pereira there 			
 there's Jiju Jacob 			
tall Kerala defender who also played the last 			
year's final of the Santosh trophy against Goa 			
the lone victory for Kerala in the Santosh trophy came in			
nineteen seventy-three one word home turf in Ernakulam 			
when they beat Railways three-two in the final 			
Maharashtra on the other hand twice winners of the Santosh			
trophy in nineteen fifty-four and nineteen sixty-three 			
throw-in for Kerala 			
Hashim there being tightly marked 			
 that's another throw-in 			
Jiju Jacob 			
now Shanti Kumar 			
ball coming to Sabu 			
Vijayan there trying to put through Hashim 			
but his chip there a little too long for Hashim 			
and Kadir in possession for Maharashtra 			
Everesto Cardoz 			
trying to inspire his forward line 			
done very little today 			
again a rather aimless pass 			
 we've seen very few attacks by the Maharashtra			
forwards today 			
they haven't combined well 			
and there have been very little understanding between the half			
line and the forward line 			
Vijayan now 			
with fallen back 			
trying to put through Harshan there's the tall			
Everesto with a header 			
ball coming to Jiju Jacob 			
the pace of the game considerably slackened here 			
 it's a quite hot afternoon 			
temperature in the mid-thirties 			
and it certainly would be energy sapping here for the 			
players 			
the first half slowly coming to an end 			
neither team have scored yet 			
Kerala now trying to build up a move through the right flank 			
Suresh Kumar there up 			
ball cleared 			
again a mispass comes to Shanti Kumar 			
 who'll be switching over from Mahindras to Mohun			
Bagan next season 			
Akeel Ansari now being dispossessed 			
Santosh 			
to Rasheed 			
trying to find Hashim on the right flank 			
very few passes here finding the intended player 			
Shanti Kumar for Maharashtra 			
to Everesto Cardoz 			
Vijayan tackling him there from behind 			
free-kick for Maharashtra 			
Godfrey Pereira 			
trying to wield his way through 			
to Shanti Kumar 			
Manoj Bhatt 			
cleared out by the Kerala defence 			
crowd here certainly gone quiet 			
and that's a throw-in none of the Maharashtra forwards			
there 			
 it's going to be a goal-kick for Kerala 			
the first half coming to a close 			
neither team have scored yet 			
with less than five minutes of play left 			
Rasheed 			
ball for Harshan 			
and that improper charge there 			
the free-kick for Maharashtra 			
Jarcinto de de Silva the stopper-back 			
Vijay Thapa has takes a tumble there 			
comes to Joseph 			
the Kerala left wing back 			
Hamid now 			
Harshan 			
to Jiju Jacob 			
the overlapping defender for Kerala 			
and his pass there misdirected 			
another Kerala move comes to nought 			
a quick counterattack here from Maharashtra 			
Arif Ansari 			
but keeps hold of the ball a little too long there 			
Akeel Ansari now 			
Cardoz again an aimless pass 			
Kerala gained possession 			
Suresh Kumar 			
ball again running loose here 			
comes to the goalkeeper 			
Rasheed for Kerala 			
a long ball trying to find Hashim 			
 there's Jarcinto with that header 			
Harshan now with the ball 			
good chance for Vijayan 			
takes a shot from just outside the penalty box a			
left-footer which goes out 			
Vijayan the captain of the Kerala team also member of the			
Kerala Police team which won the Federation Cup this year 			
and a wayward kick taken there by goalkeeper Kadir sends it			
 over the sideline 			
Kerala keep possession 			
Hamid 			
long ball there for Santosh 			
 there's Jarcinto handling that situation very well			
comes to Godfrey Pereira 			
and Maharashtra earn a free-kick 			
crowd has come here with banners and drums 			
quite a boisterous crowd 			
referee Samil awarding that free-kick to Maharashtra 			
just inside the Kerala half 			
Vijay Thapa the vice-captain to take the kick 			
Jiju the taller player there getting the better of that duel			
Kerala in possession			
Jiju Jacob overlapping 			
cutting in there very well 			
and a good ball there for Hashim			
a good chance for Kerala 			
and Hashim putting it over the net he had only to beat the			
goalkeeper there 			
very intelligent play there by Jiju Jacob 			
cut in very well 			
 It's uh time now to begin the last journey			
 from Teen Murti where he has been lying still 			
Twenty second afternoon 			
And here Shakti Sthal ten kilometres 			
the banks of the Yamuna next to his mother 			
On the night of this twenty first May the laugh of her life			
 was brutely snatched away making a reality of a worst tragedy 			
Most often she was by his side whether rain or shine 			
 but not too strong 			
This time noise life at Teen Murti 			
and around the country fly half mast 			
Grief stricken people have been queing for hours and through the			
night since that fateful night of the twenty first to pay homage			
 to a young and vigorous leader with a boyish smile and a jaunty			
step that endeared him to so many 			
Still and silent now 			
Swollen crowds wear a mute testimony to the closing chapter			
He leaves his wife and two children bereft and the nation			
plunged in destiny 			
The scene of twenty years of his life 			
 Teen Murti has recorded the joys and trivia 			
his ecstasies and the agonies of three generations of his time 			
A large number almost forty of visiting dignitories from			
around the world attending today pay tribute to this young leader 			
who was a charming and versatile diplomat a loving father a good			
friend of his country 			
The state funeral with full military honour begins in a short			
while from now 			
The gun carriage the guest and slouch carries to			
the scene for a one word 			
Rajiv Gandhi the son of Indira Gandhi and grandson of			
Jawaharlal Nehru bore the mantle of political responsibility easily			
 if with a certain reluctance 			
Once he did so he threw himself heart and soul into the role			
He was in a hurry for change and progress 			
A driving force into the twenty-first century which 			
he will now never see 			
Priyanka consoling her mother 			
Priyanka consoling her mother 			
Losing a husband losing a father a loving friend whose			
smile could charm a heart of stone 			
For them he was not a leader or Prime Minister or politician			
He was papa 			
The funeral procession will be led by Major General S C Kashyap			
 General Officer commanding Delhi area 			
Two platoons of the army one of the Navy and two of the Airforce			
 accompany the gun carriage 			
Immediately behind the gun carriage comes a firing party 			
which will be followed by the chief mourners 			
The mourners in uniform and those not in uniform 			
Forty officers of the three services of the rank of Major			
General or Brigadier have maintained continuous vigil from two 			
O'clock on the twenty second till now 			
 Teen Murti is at the moment a novice of			
the quite with the chanting people outside the world and stretching			
 the heart right down the route of the Shakti Sthal			
 			
Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar shouting in the background			
And for us the people of India we have many bleeding hearts to			
heal 			
We have yet another scar on the fabric of our country 			
A one word of another assassination 			
We have to struggle once again for that political maturity			
 that will allow the voice of democracy to be heard unhindered 			
When leaders do not have to fall at the altar of our			
insecurity 			
From around the world international leaders have expressed			
their shock grief hurt indignation and today many of them			
have come or sent their representatives to pay their last respects 			
I never thought I would have to witness this scene again 			
within a span of six and a half years 			
A day of tragedy a day of shame 			
He played the game in a stupendous drive of energy and committment			
He went from state to state knowing the people with a tireless			
drive 			
Now a martyr to democracy 			
And why ?			
Why the best reluctant politician who sacrificed his			
professional flying career to join his mother after his brother's 			
death ?			
Why that this dynamic young man who took success and defeat in			
a stride have to be struck down when he was playing the game according			
to the rule ?			
Now still silent shattered forever suspended in			
a tragedy in a nightmarish act that defies all norms of justice and			
fairplay 			
The childhood years of Rajiv Gandhi were spent here happy			
years 			
Where now his body lies in one word cold and			
still 			
Fate and assassin have claimed the lives of the			
mother and her two sons in a span of a little over one decade			
 shouting in the background 			
Too young to die too young to be a martyr too full of			
life and plans for the future to be struck down so brutally 			
Apart from close friends and relatives the main three pall			
bearers will be the chiefs of the Army Navy and Airforce 			
General S F Rodrigues Admiral L Ramdas and Airchief			
Marshall S K Mehra 			
Helicopter patrolling the sky security 			
As they lift him from what was home for twenty years to			
bring him out to the gun carriage 			
Till eleven O'clock this morning the crowds were here 			
paying their last respects and then there were moments of privacy			
The helicopter showering petals as the body is brought out			
As the helicopter showers petals on the gun carriage he			
is now handed over to the people 			
Moments to be recorded in history memories to be engraved			
on our hearts 			
They called him one of the brightest and bravest sons of India			
They called it a blow to Indian politics 			
They called out a shock nation 			
 Now in slow march the procession begins 			
And so he leaves Teen Murti for the last			
march to the banks of the Yamuna 			
We capture it on film 			
We give him the ceremony but there are no words to			
express the heinousness of this crime 			
Too young to die 			
 Now 			
Our next live telecast will be when the gun carriage 			
and the procession arrives at Cannaught Circle 			
In between recorded excerpts from supporting camera crew 			
will be brought to you from Vijay Chowk and India Gate 			
We now return you from Teen Murti to the			
studios of Doordarshan 			
 I'm now speaking to you from the studios of 			
Doordarshan 			
These are the scenes captured by our supporting camera crew as			
the funeral procession moves towards Vijay chowk 			
It is now moving on towards Cannaught Circle 			
The people have been waiting at Vijay Chowk from noon 			
unmindful of the scorching heat just to catch a final glimpse 			
of their beloved leader 			
Perhaps Summer afternoon with the temperature in there 			
forty the crowds braving the May heat waiting along the routes 			
to catch final glimpse 			
The funeral procession winding its way at snail pace 			
towards Shakti Sthal on the banks of the Yamuna 			
The route is long ten kilometres from Teen Murti			
 to Shakti Sthal 			
Mortal remains of the ex-Prime Minister move slowly down 			
to its final destination 			
People rushing breaking the cordon to have a last glimpse 			
With full military honours the tunes of the Army the			
Navy and the Airforce precede the gun carriage 			
The funeral procession is lead by the General Officer commanding			
Delhi area Major General S C Kashyap 			
Braving the scorching heat they give vent to their grief			
 shouting in the background 			
And now down Rajpath 			
The procession had left Teen Murti around one 			
thirty and is making very slow progress as the people impede			
 the route shouting in the background 			
We have recorded these scenes because it is not possible to have a			
continuous microwave uplink at all spots along the route 			
So the next live telecast will be from Cannaught Circle 			
Honours for a young leader cut down in his prime 			
Leaders around the world had expressed their indignation 			
 We are filled with indignation over the appaling and			
heinous crime 			
He was a personal friend of ours Mr Gorbachov 			
The long route to eternity showered with petals 			
Chanting of mantras at the background 			
 We're now waiting for the funeral procession to			
arrive 			
The funeral cortege carrying the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi			
on route to this place has been passing through the streets and avenues			
of Delhi with surging crowds thronging the routes bidding farewell to a			
beloved leader with tears and emotions in memory to someone who we've			
 tragically lost forever 			
And it's a sad and depressive moment as we await the			
arrival of the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi here at a spot close to			
 Shakti Sthal where they will be confined to flames 			
Close by this spot where our former Prime Minister Mrs Indira			
Gandhi Mr Rajiv Gandhi's mother was cremated less then seven			
years ago 			
Mrs Gandhi had fallen to the assassins bullets at her residence one			
Safdarjang road New Delhi 			
Today as we await the arrival of the mortal remains of Rajiv Gandhi			
 it still seems impossible to come to terms with the enormity of this			
ghastly and unbelievable tragedy 			
A bad despicable moment a bad night when Rajiv Gandhi was			
brutally killed 			
Our hearts are filled with anguish and sadness 			
Perhaps the hundreds of millions that make up this vast and			
vibrant country it is a moment for us to hang our heads in utter shame 			
There is toll of gloom only broken by the recital of devotional			
songs 			
The atmosphere steep in this sorrow of the appaling tragedy that			
left behind pain and grief and inspeakable faith after this abolutely			
shameful and dasterdly crime 			
As many of here saint says and eyes brimming with tears and 			
many left numb by the senseless tragedy 			
We have many world leaders here represented in large numbers 			
at Mr Rajiv Gandhi's funeral with over sixty delegations from			
the world over who've been coming in since yesterday to pay			
their last respect to the departed leader 			
Large crowds have gathered here today outside the cordons area			
oblivious of the heat and the dust and scortching winds 			
All here to mourn the loss of our former Prime Minister whom they			
loved and cheered 			
A leader whom they showered their love on and who in turn returned			
their affection and warmth in his untiring attempt to keep the interests			
of the common man closest to his heart 			
Today the spot where Mr Rajiv Gandhi's life last rites			
are to be performed was chosen by his daughter Priyanka who visited the			
site day before yesterday and then a couple of times thereafter to see how			
the arrangements were progressing 			
Not too far away are the spots where Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr			
Sanjay Gandhi were cremated 			
And today the mortal remains of Rajiv Gandhi are consigned to			
the flames			
It will be a time that'll echo as the last few days			
have some of the bleakest darkest and most depressing moments of our			
history 			
In a span of eleven years three members of the Gandhi family 			
victims of violence tragic and untimely end 			
Those in their last journeys to this vicinity on the banks of the			
river Yamuna 			
Now the family the immediate close family Priyanka and Mrs			
Sonia Gandhi placing sandalwood atop the funeral Pa pa			
 pyre funeral pyre before it's lit

Here we can see Prime Minister Chandrasekhar next to him is

Consigned to flames this the final and inevitable end of the			
mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi

And the whole world still time almost stopping by to mourn			
the going away of one of the greatest leader's of our time 			
Rajiv you're going to remain in our hearts and in our			
memories as an indelible part of Indian and world history 			
Our images of you will never fade till memory 			
India prays for you and may the prayers of each and every			
person who loves you as your soul rests in peace 			
India will miss you 			
The contribution of All India Radio the communication in			
the country has been invaluable 			
However often forgotten are the people and the action behind the			
scene that goes in making these programmes 			
In other sense to highlight the significant contribution of			
these individuals the All India Radio has instituted the Akashwani			
annual award to the best radio production and technical excellence is			
here 			
The awards for the year nineteen-ninety represented at a function			
 in the capital's Siri Fort auditorium on the sixteenth of			
February 			
Here are some excerpts from the function 			
It is gratifying that this year too as yesteryears we			
have received a large number of entrance 			
There were in all two hundred and sixty-four entries in			
nine disciplines 			
The number of contenstants in the technical arena was also			
quite high and the competition formidable 			
From this year we have Nasakant award for the			
best entry on national integration instituted in the memory of the			
valiant broadcaster who led down his life in the course of his duty			
Yet another award instituted this year is for the			
correspondence of the year award to recognize the contribution of			
AIR corrospondents both at home and abroad one word being			
one of the important components of the broadcasting activity 			
It is my present duty on this occasion to gratefully			
acknowledge the commendable efforts put in by the jury 			
comprising eminent broadcasters critics journalist and artist 			
We in All India Radio are conscious of the vital role AIR has			
to play in the lives of the people recognizing the inherents 			
sequence for the strong medium 			
The greater effectively to the common man and to integrate			
local communities AIR has launched local Radio Stations may be a			
new trend in broadcasting 			
The Assam Radio station which may be termed a one word 			
Radio station 			
We present a new concept in the broadcasting in India 			
Each local radia station will one word needs 			
talent and aspiration of the local community 			
It allows greater participation by the natives and as far			
as the role two words concerned it is for them the modern day			
 one word 			
Local Radio motivation the masses to strife for better quality of			
life in search of freedom for hunger better one word 			
adequate housing clean environment good education one word 			
health and above all self esteem and dignity 			
I once again express my sincere gratitude to all the members			
of the jury and especially for the broadcasting 			
Shree two words for being with us in this event 			
May I now request you sir to address the gathering and			
give away the prizes to the winners applaud 			
 Shri Shinde Shri 			
Bhatikar and distiguished members of the audience 			
Today is a proud day 			
For radio professionals a day where a good number of them			
 will receive the Akashwani Award 			
They have won after giving up their best their year's			
 best in effort and in excellence 			
I am therefore very happy to be in your midst and to			
exchange greetings with all of you and with the award winners 			
in particular 			
AIR has indeed broken new ground in our ideal fields			
 and great many strikes 			
The gulf war has only added to our challenges even though			
 we are not the actual theatre of war 			
AIR I must say has reason to be challenge admirably 			
by not only providing to the listening public news from the battle			
fronts but also by promoting public awareness on the			
importance of conserving energy petrolium products one			
word economy in national expenditure as well as of 			
fighting the evils of hoarding and black marketing 			
The media for becoming more and more vulnerable and media			
management is therefore becoming increasingly complex 			
On the one hand is the paradox of care air time being			
available and an insatiable demand for more radio time 			
from ever larging ever enlarging an interested groups 			
The promoters of anti-cosumerism the environmentalist			
 and a host of other social activists 			
On the other hand there is the growing recognition 			
of the importance of media and their autonomy and a constant threat			
 by extremist elements the millitants promoters of violence			
 and other anti-social elements to silence the media 			
All of us are aware of how this was brought home to us in			
the tragic assassination of Lasa Kaur who like Casa Blanca			
 the boy on the burning death is too dumb in the cause of 			
keeping the transmission on and the media flag flying 			
You may even try this when you try to produce better			
programmes than your fellow workers your seniors your juniors			
 and your equals can do 			
This is competition 			
Competition is when you perform in comparison with			
another 			
What you must try for is excellence 			
Excellence for its own sake 			
You achieve excellence ga by competing with yourself			
 and not with another 			
You achieve excellence when your sub every subsequent			
work is recognized to be greater than your previous work 			
I wish you all every success 			
Thank you applaud

 In Hindi 			
Thank you Baldev East Bengal play a long ball stay			
in their position Majeed Chapman Chapman playing away to			
the left Sushanu Dey making room for Chapman 			
And here Shanti Majumdar Sushanu replace Vikas Panje 			
Few minutes to go 			
Taking attempt to cross from the left 			
East Bengal earn a flag kick 			
Tushar Rakshit he is leaving for Sushanu Dey 			
Dey is uh shirt number six as he positions the ball 			
He will take that gentle left footer which will come 			
swabing away 			
And ball by Majumdar 			
Up go Mohun Bagan Gunabir Singh 			
Long ball on the right 			
And going for a goal kick in favour of East Bengal 			
Mohun Bagan got a couple of positive chances to forge ahead			
 again they haven't succeeded 			
Sushanu Dey moves here gently forward 			
Pasha looks for Chapman 			
He has in the world lot of uh coverage he darts very quick			
 to this uh nimble feet 			
And here is a long range shot in Hindi 			
 It's going net across the stadium all through the			
Feroz Shah Kotla cricket ground 			
So a new ball has been requisitioned 			
Alok Das who will take the goal kick now he instead gets			
a pass from Tanomoi Bose 			
Ranjan Dey back to Das 			
Referee Gulab Chauhan blows the whistle to stop play because			
 suddenly the old ball has also come back into the playing arena 			
Now the referee will throw the ball he drops it 			
And East Bengal move out with Sushanu Dey 			
He is moving very acute on to the left full swing 			
But the ball in any case had gone over 			
Section of the spectators of the ground level 			
Really that place of the ground level you you just cannot			
enjoy the game of football at that uh level from that eye view 			
than uh perhaps where we are in the commentators box and those on the upper			
terraces laughter 			
 In Hindi 			
Ranjan Dey is header 			
Butia 			
Rakshit 			
Sushanu Dey 			
Oh God here the chance and Sanjay Majhi again ideally			
positioned just above the one word he succeeds in getting the			
angle pass Tanomoi Bose 			
But that angle is a little too much and the goal just			
rolled across the goal line 			
Few uh metres away from the uprise 			
So East Bengal's first chance in this second half to			
have forged ahead 			
Watch it again Sushanu Dey puts the ball ahead Sanjoy			
Majhi runs in from the left 			
Goal keeper Bose turns rushing out and that angle is			
 wide by a few metres 			
Majumdar leads the ball for Majhi 			
Majhi slow Satyajit gets the ball 			
Gunabir gets it to back down the line 			
Foul committed before the ball rolled out 			
Satyajit Ancheri doesn't trap cleanly 			
Tarun De Biachung Butia Carlton Chapman Gunabir			
kicks it out 			
Iliyas Pasha for the throwing for East Bengal 			
Swaroop Das won't let Vijayan anywhere close 			
In the air the dole won by Alok Das 			
This game is also has its highs and lows 			
The sweet and sours both the teams having missed out one 			
opportunities to Mohun Bagan as has had a better share 			
Dulal Biswas Butia 			
Butia tackled by Satyajit 			
 It's Sushanu Dey in possession 			
And it's a faulty forward pass looking for Majumdar			
Swaroop Das got a very clean ahead Pasha clears 			
taken by Gunabir waits for the bounce it's too long 			
Chapman puts it out to play 			
Gunabir Satyajit Chatterjee Suryan mark Akeel Ansari 			
Ancheri very quick indeed 			
To Ansari Ansari again coming down the middle cannot get			
passed 			
Tarun De 			
Ansari very agile player 			
Despite the fact that he looks lean and hungry 			
Scrappy struggle on at the moment in the mid field ball			
running left and right a few yards 			
Now in Mohun Bagan's possession 			
And certainly the crowd doesn't like that 			
Supporters of both the teams present in thousands 			
The score board is blank in the nineteen ninety-four Durand final			
Butia 			
Pasha 			
Yes Sushanu Dey looking for the open and there is nobody			
there for that pass played on the left 			
Nil nil 			
Foul there uh again Mohun Bagan referee Chouhan			
going towards outside right Robin Ghosh giving him bit of warning 			
Swaroop Das it shall be for the free kick 			
Gently chipping it away onto the left flank 			
Stopped by Dulal Biswas the big centre 			
Alok Das 			
Amitabh Chandra 			
Back to Das 			
Long ball played 			
And Akeel Ansari in no mood to oblige Vijayan is on his own way			
 Mohun Bagan forward constantly on the run 			
Athanu Bhattacharya sensing a bit of danger in Vijayan did the			
right thing to come up to the ball 			
Foul was committed by Vijayan 			
Here comes the a free kick 			
Tushar Rakshit dispossessed Biswas backing up 			
 It's uh stretches 			
Twenty-two minutes of the game gone this is the near outpull			
eastern stand 			
Very popular with the football lovers of the city 			
Oh comes inside the box 			
Here is the chance for Chapman he raise for the second bounce			
Alok Mukherjee gets to the ball 			
Butia controls back passing to Swaroop Das back to Butia 			
And Butia again attempt to pass Iliyas pasha who has gone two			
yards ahead acknowledges to Butia saying well my fault my			
friend in the meanwhile Mohun Bagan uh defender Alok Mukherjee			
 is on the ground very close to his own penalty box 			
Time off has been called by the referee 			
And gives a little bit of time for uh two players to have			
A gulp of water 			
Those two the uh touch line is the Satyajeet Chatterjee 			
A stretcher being called Alok Mukherjee going to be taken			
out for first aid 			
Chatterjee is throwing 			
Ancheri 			
Pasha now Chapman gets the ball Pasha again 			
Butia for East Bengal he is quick but he hold			
himself but it is given Butia moves upon to the right Chapman with			
the first time pass 			
And uh Vikas Panje 			
Uh Sanjay Majhi that was unable to control Gunabir			
Long ball from Vijayan Ansari is there Vijayan is quicker			
Again with East Bengal positioned Swaroop Das 			
Iliyas Pasha 			
Sushanu Dey is ahead in the dual Ranjan gets the better			
 off Majumdar 			
Satyajit Chatterjee sets up Akeel Ansari 			
Square pass Amitabh Chandra there is it for Gautam Ghosh			
 the linesman flag goes up for off side 			
Dulal Mohun Bagan playing with ten the moment they could			
be looking for a substitution for Alok Mukherjee 			
But no it's not Alok Mukherjee who is going out 			
it's going to be Bernard who is replacing Gunabir 			
So Bernard is one of the many important players today donning			
 the colours of the Calcutta Football Club 			
It started many years ago with the Iranian then came			
the Nigerian and here is Bernand in position for Mohun Bagan 			
East Bengal defence kept back 			
Akil Ansari too much of time 			
And Ancheri waits for that opportunity Swaroop Das rises to			
the occasion but Mohun Bagan again come up 			
Amitabh Chandra now takes a shot 			
It goes wide 			
East Bengal goal keeper Athanu Bhattacharya takes the kick			
Rakshit fails to stop it 			
Ball to Ghosh 			
On the right flank gentle chip for Vijayan 			
Vijayan will look for Ancheri 			
Pasha gets to it no he cannot break the hold of Mohun			
Bagan 			
This time Tarun De aheads it away 			
Butia 			
East Bengal at the receiving end 			
Slowly pull the ball out Chapman resting it ones the ball			
gone how to play 			
Alok Mukherjee back onto the playing arena with the throw in			
Satyajeet Chatterjee Akeel Ansari now 			
Pushing forward Amitabh to a good over lap 			
In the ball and uh reverse bicycle attempt kick from			
Ancheri 			
Atanu quiet yet 			
Behind it was not really in position not in the ideal			
situation 			
So even attempt trying that reverse meanwhile a foul			
commited 			
Rakshit playing square to Pasha 			
East Bengal fearing to lose the stint which was evident			
earlier on 			
Tanomoi Bose rolling it for Alok Das 			
Satyajit Chatterjee up come Chandra 			
Ansari 			
Ball to Gautam Ghosh Dulal Biswas in front of him 			
Ansari again the ball went lose 			
To the right back Chandra 			
Passes it inside the box headed out 			
Vijayan now and Butia gets it 			
He will have to gather speed he will have to give a long ball			
through gives it to Majumdar gives enough of time to the Mohun Bagan			
defender to fall back in position 			
Here comes the cross but the tall Alok Das will have			
nothing go pass him 			
Vijayan all over up and down he is like the human machine			
He and Ancheri really haven't stop things going for Mohun			
Bagan 			
Swaroop Das and Tarun De have been outstanding in the deep			
present as indeed Iliyas Pasha Dulal Biswas has been doing a good			
overlap on the left for East Bengal 			
Here is Bernard back passing you can see he is giving it away			
to East Bengal 			
Majumdar Chapman Chapman Chatterjee here is Bernard			
now for Mohun Bagan 			
Gentle throw to Ancheri Ancheri is crossing but quiet			
harmlessly to Atanu Bhattacharya 			
Sushanu De 			
There is a too long Alok Das Sanjay Majhi one to one			
situation 			
Easily outwitted Satyajit Akeel Ansari 			
Gautam Ghosh fixed it up closes attack on line Mohun Bagan			
looking dangerous now 			
What you say to that Ancheri with just a goal keeper			
to beat 			
With the out step of his left he doesn't collect to the			
way and expectations of the Mohun Bagan team man 			
Here watch it again a good piece of workmen Gautam Ghosh			
 and look at Ancheri he is all by himself Vijayan has moved up			
And all Ancheri is to do is to kick it away with his right he			
prefers his left because probably it is the defender coming in his			
view 			
And he had so much of time and plenty of uh angle as well			
 to beat the goal keeper wasn't very far 			
That makes the mess of it 			
So East Bengal survive 			
Nil nil as we move into the thirty-first minute of the second			
half 			
Yes Mohun Bagans attack again there is going up Ancheri 			
Well it's a goal applause Oh one word			
 Ancheri gets the first goal for Mohun Bagan in the thirty-first			
minute of the second half 			
Movements again from the right warmed it and Mohun Bagan were			
looking dominating looking threatening as you watch Gautam			
Ghosh on the right pushes the ball forward and here is Ancheri			
 number eleven 			
This time he is not making any mistake he controls with his left			
He outwit the deep defence Swaroop Das as top on the wrong			
foot Dulal Biswas is left behind and here comes that whacker which			
is narrowing the angle beating goalkeeper Tanu Bhattacharya and			
 it's one zero for Mohun Bagan 			
So luck eventully running out for East Bengal 			
Ancheri scoring the first goal drawing the first 			
two words in the final of the nineteen ninety-four Durand Cup 			
Throwing for Mohun Bagan and for commentory Baldev 			
 In Hindi 			
So it's going to be Mohun Bagan for the kick off			
with Vijayan back passing 			
Akeel Ansari he is just behind 			
Alok Das Ranjan Dey 			
Vijayan Gurudas Gunabir Singh just to net 			
East Bengal gain position Gunabir again now to Mohun Bagan			
Gunabir is a link man 			
Back passing Amitabh Chandra inside the box 			
taken by Tarun De 			
 It's there Sanjoy Majhi give there to Vikas Panje			
Panje looks for Carlton Chapman 			
Alok Mukherjee is there 			
Ranjan Dey 			
Alok Mukherjee the long left Vijayan will not get			
through it clear 			
Comes to Butia 			
Butia for East Bengal in the Mohun Bagan half 			
Short pass 			
Rakshit 			
Tushar Rakshit going into the open he is being tackled by			
 Alok Das 			
Gautam Ghosh Gunabir Singh now 			
Mohun Bagan in position 			
Up comes Amitabh Chandra right back 			
To his right striker right winger Ghosh 			
Tackled by Dulal Biswas as he crosses 			
Iliyas Pasha was the men carrying away from there 			
Satyajit Gunabir again looking for Satyajit Chatterjee 			
Butia Sushanu Dey on to the left now Dulal Biswas 			
the left back Vikas Panje 			
Hello and welcome to the highlights of the fourth One Day			
International between India and the West Indies 			
India were leading two one before the match at the			
Barabati stadium Cuttuck 			
The West Indies desperately needing to win here to level			
off the series at two all and to make it a real live affair for			
the fifth One Day International at Jaipur which follows			
on Friday 			
The West Indies made one change beside that it lost at Vizag 			
they dropped Barrington Browne and preferred to strengthen their batting 			
bringing in Shivnarine Chanderpaul 			
India had to drop Navjot Siddhu who was injured and brought in			
Atul Bedade but surprisingly they brought back Chetan Sharma in			
place of Venkatesh Prasad 			
It was a cloudy morning when Courtney Walsh the West Indian			
captain won the toss and elected to bat 			
We pick up the play of the very first ball of the morning 			
 It's Manoj Prabhakar bowling to Phil Simmons 			
 In Hindi 			
West it's fascinating structure there 			
People standing on the balconies 			
Looking end of the side screen like the centre piece of			
pavilion 			
 That's gone away for four runs 			
Simmons aiming it well 			
Striking it at off the space just behind square 			
That was favourite cut of Simmons 			
A cut short centre wide there is two ways of cutting one			
with the horizontal bat and one with perpendicular that was the 			
perpendicular way of playing the square cut 			
 It's straight away to Azharuddin there in the gully			
That was an exotic catch Phil went into the trap and it went			
straight away to Azhar			
Quite difficult to tell really 			
Simmons got back really and hit it very hard 			
Here I had seen that was a catch			
Indeed Azharuddin a very agile normally was			
amongst 			
That end up very very powerful over			
Azharuddin had had to go to his right 			
This is a good start by the West Indies because uh there			
was a quite a bit of moment early on uh in this wicket and uh 			
the two of them have counted that very well 			
Great shot there by Simmons like he go for runs 			
four runs square cut 			
That really is a trademark shot of uh Simmons uh shot			
 a little bit of width being a tall man standing up here 			
That balls are by Chetan giving Williams all those to play his			
shot back foot cover drive			
Four runs 			
Williams particularly is very good at shot 			
Well he gave that a fair old whack uh that Steuart			
Williams a ball to be head short and on a wicket of this nature			
now with the uh ball not coming on to the bat that's a free			
hand for the batsman specially the West Indian batsman with such good			
backfoot there 			
There he's given it a fair old thump 			
Could be out 			
Yes he is 			
Good catch by Manoj 			
 That's a generous really happy and very good well			
judged that catch by Manoj there			
Running back a little bit 			
And there William's gone 			
First wicket for India and to Chetan Sharma 			
Williams not getting on top of that short ball I think he was			
beaten a little bit by pace here and uh hurried on to him and uh 			
ball coming a lot quicker then he expected and getting the top edge and Manoj			
Prabhakar here running around taking a good catch 			
That will do Chetan Sharma as a morale world of good 			
Caught Prabhakar bowled Sharma for fifteen 			
 That's more of a desperate shot stepping out 			
Uh but well played outside a square drive stepping out			
 That's a very good shot to play 			
Four runs there 			
 In Hindi 			
In the air but it's safe 			
Lara not trying to bow but he've still soon then			
But he's gone off fast on it for that to go away 			
for four runs 			
Sharma now to Hooper 			
Jadeja was giving his side he is out 			
What a brilliant throw and uh a very well field 			
Hooper does is out			
What a marvellous piece of cricket from Jadeja but careless by			
Hooper who was very one word to walk about like that 			
Certainly very very careless and another wicket of West Indies			
could not afford to lose particular Hooper being run out			
Hooper has been playing so well 			
And that is uh uh uh for a big support for the West Indies			
team uhm Hooper there playing the ball uh to a shot mid-wicket			
 just taken off and Jadeja coming in and pick the ball up and a			
lovely throw hit the wicket on time 			
Seventy-seven for three 			
 It's straight 			
 It's another good short there by Lara 			
Shrinath is the fielder			
Coming back for the second and it was fast throw but			
 not out says the umpire 			
But this Indian team so certainly hit in the stumps from all			
over the field 			
Uh again that could have been pretty close if Lara played it to			
mid-wicket and and Shrinath run run they have taken up and a			
lovely throw in 			
See there Lara is in there just in time 			
Once again he has to chase the run he won't get that 			
It was played very fine by Lara 			
Late and fine and nicely controlled 			
In the air and a big appeal 			
No says the umpire Mr Jose Kurushinkal that came off the pad 			
so 			
Have a look at that one again 			
Another particularly good shot and up and uh very			
good decision 			
Well that's the edge it's four runs 			
All is fair in love and war as they say 			
The end of the over 			
Twenty-four overs and it's ninety-nine for three 			
 applaud and whistles 			
So Lara well he is beginning to make a significant score even			
though he work on the score is many of his runs made one word 			
like that 			
And another fielder at the other end 			
 It's one word to time again the counter term			
with the mis field by Anil Kumble 			
Well he did that well for four			
It was a lovely shot moving freely into the half volly 			
Kumble now to Lara 			
Well that was delicately played 			
And that is gone away for four runs 			
Just about as fine as you could get it 			
Kumble now to Arthurton 			
And that runs for Arthurton to fine leg it could well go for four			
there 			
It does 			
So a productive over for the West Indies			
Twenty-five overs have gone it's a hundred and			
thirteen for three 			
And that's beautifully played by Lara wide across at			
short fine leg 			
Four more 			
Runs certainly coming in 			
Very good running between the wicket 			
Excellent 			
 In Hindi 			
 That's a lovely shot there 			
And over the top 			
six runs 			
Brian have been trying to play the shot for quite sometime 			
from the last over he has been successful now 			
 It's Arthurton facing Raju 			
Uh that should be a close one 			
Uh I thought he played right across the line Ravi 			
Here the ball is spinning so it's it's not easy			
for Raju to get a leg before decision unless it's it's			
 a straight throw as you can see its pitched outside the line and uh 			
the batsman also has its foot outside the off stump 			
Umpire has given him out 			
It was a magnificient catch 			
 Arthur Arthurton stepping out stepping down 			
from the one word end was a big one word and bat back			
 caught brilliantly by Mongia at just silly mid on 			
Straight drive beautiful shot all the way almost going to			
the boundary			
Yes it is long on boundary wide off long on fielder had			
no chance 			
Very good shot there by Brian Lara 			
Square cut there 			
Lara Lara has been playing the shot very well all the way for			
four runs 			
There again brilliant paceman that's a bad			
ball from Raju giving Lara room and in this kind of form he is not going to			
waste uh deliveries of that kind there 			
Playing it late and beating the fielder at deep point giving			
him absolutely no chance 			
Like I said this is a much better Brian Lara you are seeing 			
Stepping down before the ball is delivered straight down			
and well fielded			
No 			
Yes it is 			
Just inside the boundary line well done by Raju once again			
just two runs 			
Raju in the end doing well 			
To stop the ball just inside the fence 			
Oh there and he is out 			
Umpire has given him out 			
Wicket keeper umpire that's a good skill good piece			
of keeping by Mongia who picked up all the loss done by and uh and			
this Lara being stumped 			
Stumped Mongia bowled Kumble 			
Ah there is excellent piece of glove work here by Nain Mongia			
because Brian Lara slipped a bit when he played that shot and just			
dragged his leg outside as uh you would be able to see here			
There you see just dragging and Mongia in a flash and his			
leg is just an inch outside the crease maybe even on the line but 			
that's out 			
 A good decision by the umpire there 			
 But that is 			
End of the thirty ninth over			
West Indies are one ninety one for five 			
And the new batsman coming in 			
Should be Chanderpaul 			
Batsman one word Chanderpaul hasn't played a match			
after the Bombay one day 			
And he should be replacing Lara 			
Left hander replacing another left hander 			
Very important wicket for India that because Lara was			
looking extremely dangerous 			
He is a type of player who likes to play long innings and he had			
uh still another fourteen overs to go 			
 That's way he was out 			
High play and he is given out			
Yes going right across the line of delivery 			
And again umpire Jayprakash giving Chanderpaul out 			
L B W bowled Jadeja 			
Funny all this game can change uh you lose the wicket			
 when side is cruising			
And now here again Chanderpaul playing across the line to			
delivery from Jadeja that was coming in and paying the penalty 			
Wide of the crease Jadeja angling at it and as you can see			
 Chanderpaul one word is not playing across 			
Score one ninety-two for six now West Indies 			
 That's well played there 			
And Manoj shot that by just like stepping for the going near			
the ball and four runs all the way 			
With two fielders they are pretty close to each other the			
man at short third and backward point there is a very little gap there			
 but uh Holder placing the ball to perfection 			
He was waiting on it 			
And at the very last minute tabbing it down and placing it			
beautifully past Manoj Prabhakar 			
Once it beaten the other fielders had absolutely no chance			
 That's wide over there and Manoj Prabhakar			
alternate			
Yes he has gone in there 			
A simple catch Manoj Prabhakar at long on and Junior Murray			
is out 			
Caught Prabhakar bowled Jadeja 			
Trying to hit the ball out of the ground he has just come in			
to bat uh and it's gather shot by uh Murray because he			
needed to give his senior partner Holder as much of the strike as			
possible			
There was no need for a short of this kind 			
There is still over fifty balls to play and West Indies should be			
trying and picking up uh the single ones and twos and allowing uh 			
Holder to do face on the the bowling because uh losing wickets at			
this stage regularly can put tremendous pressure on the new man who comes in			
The score is two hundred and two for seven West Indies			
Jadeja to Holder 			
 That's in the air it's going over the top			
for six 			
Uh Kambli also has gone over the top uh he was unable as			
well 			
He has some of the gut shot uh before he picks it up			
early 			
Gone into position 			
So it's going to be Kumble now to bowl to Andy			
Cummins 			
Cummins is gone he is given out he was sweeping 			
there and uh the umpire uh Mr Kurushinkal has turned out there so			
Cummins is on his way 			
Uh that fell well whether we take that probably just at			
the outside of the off stump 			
No one is certain as to what happen 			
Uh except obviously the wicket keeper Mongia 			
The bail is off and Walsh is gone 			
He has asked the Indian perhaps they said well one word 			
and very unspendidly he has taken that word for it and he is out 			
Well it was very difficult to say because he seem to be right			
cover in the wicket and just pushing at the ball as you can see			
there 			
And it seems that it his pad in the way			
But it's probably just took the outside			
edge of the stumps 			
Yes yes there you can see the wicket keeper gloves is away			
back and you see the man in there and two twenty-eight for nine			
 One word uhm Shrinath again to Holder 			
Oh is it that may be a mild but he didn't picked this			
well			
 It's well fielded by Kumble 			
Shrinath now to one word Cuffy 			
Another full toss he played it before 			
Well that was perfectly played and it takes Cuffy to nine 			
He couldn't have played that very safe			
Well I think that Cuffy can raise and walk in and Hooper			
 because Hooper played that similiar kind of shot when he played			
in the last game			
When he went inside to the full toss			
And that was a lovely shot 			
As you can see Cuffy gets an inside there 			
He played that didn't he ?			
Uhm skidding it wide of the leg stump 			
Cuffy there was coming down looking for the big hit 			
Umpire examining two words I think so 			
Cuffy but it's a get down on target out 			
I got some uh upon the hot shot like uh I got some			
sensational news his highest score in this cricket is one 			
He never scored more than singles so he reaching his top			
score as fifteen runs 			
Last ball being bowled now 			
Oh he is obviously over there going for single oh laughs			
And I tell you what Prabhakar he hadn't put his hand to the			
when that ball hit the wicket 			
Good morning and welcome to you all from the Bargodora			
swimming pool here in New Delhi where we shall shortly see the

nations in the world 			
 Yes 			
 And unfortunately the China is not participating			
in dive			
Oh thinking will be this competition is not very			
Yeah very low that's a bit slow 			
For them it's a very low competition 			
China competing for diving you know they are the world class			
 they are the best in the world 			
So therefore for them of course there is no competition 			
But even then it's good they've come for			
swimming atleast and this uh which adds a great glamour and colour			
to the competition and so many of these younger children who will be			
participating in the age group			
Yeah 			
This is Indian team which is uh coming in front of you			
 and you find all youngsters including Anupama Louis Abhinaya			
Shetty all facing the screen 			
So the youngsters who are here not only from India but			
from the other ten countries will be the names to reckon with in 			
atleast the Asian swimming uh scene in the next few years			
Yes			
These little children of twelve and thirteen who are 			
so many of them might be gold medalists in the next Asain Games 			
after Hiroshima in the year uh nineteen ninety-eight who knows

saying ki

I am thankfull to Yashji Pam Honey Adi everybody 			
Shahrukh Honey Juhi for helping me and Tanvi of course getting			
this award			
Thanks a lot thank you very much 			
Could I request Mr Sanjay Dutt to present the award to			
the best supporting actress ? 			
This is the captain of the Haryana side and trying to			
 get back into the Indian team 			
 That's Ram Saran 			
Gurdeep Singh Sanjeev Ram Saran on the crossing there 			
and uh empire Sachin Navadia who was this side of the team at the			
moment is supervising the match with uh T S Bullard on the			
opposite side 			
 That's Gurdeep Singh 			
No no 			
Kishan Singh stop there by Shakira 			
Jagbir obstruct it 			
Narendra number two Gurdeep Singh he has been playing very			
well I am sure in this tournament 			
Sanjeev Kumar kicks there 			
Sanjay Bisht India player 			
Gurdeep Singh and there is Mukesh Kumar playing there 			
Still in possession still got the ball in position now Balbir			
Sahani hold out for off time 			
A gentle stroke Saki who picked up that ball for Haryana			
Ashok Kumar stopped it Gurdeep Singh on Baljit 			
Baljit in possession 			
Ball given to him by Baljit Singh off there he			
knew his position all over the island and now Indian Airline			
trying to make headway 			
A beaten there 			
Sanjay Bhatia 			
Haryana into move now 			
Baljit coming five men across the struck in the process			
 ball over the striker but no chance Ram Saran could not get a			
strike 			
Good to be the goal the play he eject at last certain			
bid of the touch to uh a straight ball and we have a goal out 			
But Ram Saran missed and the first chance for Haryana 			
has gone a waste			
Manoj Kumar very ferocious outside 			
The ball is in possession 			
A sure goal there for Mukesh Kumar 			
He will play final decision into the crossway 			
Oh he made a loss of it but he did a better job but it was 			
Gurdeep who could have stick out there and uh Mukesh lost possession 			
Anyway they have a corner ball hit and now let us see			
what uh uh this Ranjit Kumar can do but then Gundeep has come			
back there 			
Ram Saran in good lead trying to make headway obstructed and			
kicks watch again Gundeep men who gets a drift put the ball at			
far square on that uh Sanjeev Kumar got a catch from good run get			
hold of the ball 			
Amar Singh Negi that was who were outside from the ball from			
there and uh play it for uh Indian Airline			
Shakeel Ahmed 			
Down to Mukesh Kumar 			
Mukesh moving well today 			
He had a practice tournament here Baljit Gundeep on			
to the Ram Saran 			
Ram Saran still in the lead ahead couple of yards but I am			
sure he knows that he is not there in his own position and that's			
 end of a ball flight			
So another cross wasted 			
Harvinder Sanjay Bisht Rajpal to Mukesh Kumar but ball			
 a little bit uh shallow and it goes out before he had it 			
Final of this Federation Cup 			
The first five minutes did not produce uh yielding 			
unexpected but Haryan definitely having as much of the game as			
Indian Airlines			
Gundeep trying to make headway and uh fully that ball out			
in the two words 			
Ball deflected out to corner 			
So in the first corner Indian Airlines the Airlines have won			
 and now its turn of Haryana and taking the corner hit is uh			
 Gundeep Kumar 			
He goes to a former India player 			
Gundeep and they all charging here and deflected 			
Gundeep Kumar stop there by Mohammad Arif 			
Tries his scoop doesn't do it well and touch the penalty			
corner in a good way 			
Baljit Singh is going to take the push and is going to be			
 well Gurdeep Singh for the hit also near him Ram Saran			
 Mukesh Kumar and uh that's it 			
And what a lovely shot there is a good short there tries			
to the corner 			
But got to face the one word Gundeep Kumar try to			
make a big hit 			
He was to make well but misfield but tries well 			
Second penalty corner on to a real big shot two words 			
The Haryana boys are putting the pressure over Indian			
Airlines 			
Another penalty corner second corner now two words			
 Baljit Kumar Baljit Kumar who played one play ball is out there			
 he always have to play around Sanjay Bisht one word teaming			
up with Sanjay Bisht 			
He is a bit of trying hard and driving 			
It is secure there by Kishan Singh and given on to 			
Gundeep and over to Daljit it's over to Sukumar 			
 Saran Kumar has given up there uh moving this uh 			
defence why middle of exchange of will serve			
And thinking of strucking by and empire Sachin Navadia serving			
the call to penalty corner 			
 That's Daljit taking collecting by Kuldeep side			
 in time ball deflected out corner 			
Here penalty corner kick 			
He did it for two words but went for the straight shot			
 but uh the ball was deflected there by goalkeeper 			
Subbaiah's stick and in corner now Sanjay Bisht in possession			
Now that is uh Negi 			
A misfield for Haryana 			
Haryana definetly doing most of the attacking in this first			
half 			
And uh considering that they are the under dogs for this			
final is certainly well good cheer up to what Jagbir does now 			
And crossing there and uh again got the chance lost 			
I mean the score still one as it here appears over to Kuku			
Wadia			
 In Hindi 			
For our viewers now we have that man here Mr K P S			
 Gill			
You have been watching Mr Gill the matches in this			
Federation Cup practically everyday 			
Did you find any outstanding talent during these last few days ?			
Uh most of the players uh who were there in the camp 			
uh are again been asked to join the camp and we've found			
about seven new faces here who will be asked to come into			
the camp 			
But watching Haryana I've been very impressed with			
their play 			
Yes specially Sanjeev Kumar is doing exceptionally well			
Yes uh and I want to have a separate look at			
Haryana altogether			
I want to see how they impress so with such team 			
And they have been really been playing together 			
And I believe you have and the half the team from Punjab			
 and half the team from Haryana 			
Uh there are players from Punjab Sindh Bank there are players			
from B S F uh but basically it's uh it's not of			
 team which has played together for a long team			
Yes they have impressed considerably 			
Now what do you think uh should be done as far as uh if			
you go round the whole Jalandhar you see the boards a revival of the			
Indian hockey being planned 			
Now what you are going about doing that ?			
You see uh at the moment uh certain planning has			
gone in as far as Asian Games are concerned and thereafter the			
World Cup 			
But I will be looking after the uh Champions Trophy and the			
Olympic Games ninety-five and ninety-six and uh then after that			
And the objective will be to win these two tournaments 			
So far as the Asian Games is concerned uh it's 			
obvious the time is very short 			
Now but do you have any graded procedures to raise the			
standard of hockey in India ?			
Uh for these two tournaments which are 			
coming up immediately there is nothing much we can add on to what			
has been happening 			
But for the tournaments which are in ninety-five and ninety-six			
 we will have to launch a massive talent search by the end of this year			
 pick up a large number of good players and trained them at			
different places 			
And then try to see that there is an overall uhm raising of			
the standard so that when we go into the Champions Trophy 			
and subsequently the Olympic uh uh we're going as a combination			
which is feared all over the world 			
Now you have about forty odd boys in the camp at			
Chandigarh juniors 			
Now what you are going to do about them ?			
Those are the boys who've been selected uh from			
various camps which were held in country including some boys from the			
 Academy Airlines Academy and uh in Delhi 			
Now we are trying to constituent a team because we have			
been invited for juniors double games in Australia and Spain 			
and in Germany 			
The idea is to try and send out fit teams to these two countries			
And then watch for these players show 			
May you also have a long term life as concerning 			
youngsters in the country 			
What you want to do about them ?			
You see I've been talking to people uh 			
who've uh been associated with hockey and I find that one			
of the recommendations is that we should trust in young 			
So by winter of this year November we shall be			
launching a talent search all over the country for the age group ten to			
fourteen 			
And we will try to get these players into uh centre where			
astro-turf is there 			
So that they can start playing on astro-turf 			
And uh also they will be given uh all sort of uh			
fitness uh programme over the next few years 			
So that uh they build up strength they build up stamina and			
build up speed and simultaneously the hockey skills adopted 			
In addition to that uh thereafter from next year onwards 			
we will keep on adding on by having a look at the boys ten years			
old and selecting them to keep on to uh enter this uh			
stream			
So that we always have good players whenever you ask 			
Anyway let's hope your leadership Mr Gill			
 will uh bring the revival of the Indian hockey 			
Thank you very much			
Thank you 			
Okay let's come down here at the Burlton Park			
stadium 			
And the pace in the game has slowed down 			
Also then Indian Air Airlines 			
are having a diffi difficult time 			
containing this Haryana force 			
Though they have nothing to fear they'll be making			
the break through they have been searching for all through this back uptill			
now 			
So far as Airline had three good chances very well done I mean			
strike 			
In fact that's Haryana it can goal			
He must be having to chose between and uh that's the			
ultimately it goes to the penalty corner decision and Mohammed Arif			
has always been scoring for the Indian Airlines 			
One penalty corner but he didn't do it to get			
And Haryana on to down this			
There is this new break in Haryana team			
Now after this kick for Indian Airlines			
Good throw ball there for Rajinder Singh but Baljit Singh			
takes ball there and comes out in the clear still in possession 			
Miracle there by Sanjay Bhatia and put it through			
 Sanjeev and uh Kurian Indian Airlines but that's 			
true there is a lot of doing 			
Sanjeev Bhatia trying to make headway down the left flank			
 not successful 			
Free hit to be taken now by Gurdeep Singh 			
Now the the frail Haryana push back and Tandon given			
service in this competition 			
Every match practically he has played very well 			
Baljit Gundeep Kumar 			
 Haryana side in possession Harinder gets it 			
And lose it call after to Bhutia and back to Harinder			
 and on to Mohammed Arif 			
Arif is the India pull back who has been on the India team			
 over the last four tournaments abroad 			
And let's see what Shakeel Ahmed the captain of			
India do 			
It was a good throw there by Jagbir but uh it was twist there			
by Kishan Singh 			
And a free hit for Indian Airlines just outside the			
penalty corner 			
Shakeel Ahmed back to Sanjay Bisht 			
Getting to the centre you can see the wet ground there 			
That is as I talk a little shower we had it's the			
 one word now at the moment but uh towards uh this uh 			
one word in this two words on this to put up pace 			
Pick the ball now Sanjeev Kumar for Haryana 			
The ball there by Harvinder of course he may 			
recording broken and Sanjeev takes it to the end 			
It was through the drive reflection that was two words 			
Harvinder tried on numerous occasion one side Gundeep Kumar on			
the other side Jagbir Singh 			
Both have been missing constantly 			
They drop the best chance anybody could have asked for 			
But the one that Gundeep Kumar had in the first half when			
uh Sanjeev Kumar put him through 			
When he made unstopper to chance and Haryana are			
still fighting to get the ball uptill now 			
Indian Airlines on the attack now 			
Ajay Singh in possession say in twist breath first Rawat			
Gundeep Kumar has gone in plan to tame now and he gets all the			
back over there 			
 Bhishan had good match today 			
Trying to make headway gets near of the goal line but it was			
brought down by that water there 			
Even then he tried but the ball was stuck in slush but here is			
water and one word 			
And foul there uh by Sanjay Bisht 			
And Sanjeev Kumar trying to make headway and uh driving			
first Shakeel Ahmed who has gone down on the ground there and he was			
trying to push him through there 			
And uh inadvertently Sanjeev Kumar stick went into his stomach			
now look at it 			
It was not an intentional foul but uh Shakeel went down			
And he is getting medical attention 			
We are seeing the man with the T-shirt and uh the white			
T-shirt and the red cap he was the former captain of India 			
Have won and the final penalty corner hit as in the game and			
coming behind there is Subbaiah being played and was was played			
by India on numerous occasion 			
And uh with the absence of Ashish Ballal who has hurt his			
knee in camp Subbaiah has been functioning all through uh			
I mean all matches here while uh if Ballal was there he would not			
have been here 			
So anyway it's why he doesn't to the occasion and he			
has functioned very well indeed 			
Against Bombay he brought out on that lovely chase and again			
today he is pitied against in fact the reasons are behind Gundeep			
Kumar not making uh sure shots at goal was that he was afraid that if			
he doesn't keep the ball in the right place he would not be able to beat			
Subbaiah 			
So Subbaiah is is slogging with jats that's 			
frustrating the Haryana forwards 			
Though one must say that uh Gundeep Kumar and then Baljit			
would have the chance to score but they did not make 			
Now later half begin 			
Mukesh Kumar switches to two words 			
It is obstructed there by Baljit Singh 			
Played inside return pass square Mukesh Kumar 			
And Mukesh drive it towards Shakeel luckily Shakeel gets hold			
of Pramod Kumar and this side is Sanjay Bisht trying to make hit 			
He hit that ball and comprising out of course hitting			
dangerous play free hit for Haryana 			
Kishan Singh Kishan Singh on to Ram Saran 			
Ram Saran still holding up the ball 			
He is looking out for a hit somebody in the clear does			
round and loses possession there but it is lucky for him it's 			
two words 			
Not one word Sanjeev Bhatia 			
Again he still loves his crossing there and has gone to			
Baljit 			
Baljit he is coming Gundeep Kumar in the clear now 			
 let's see whether he can do anything uh unable to beat Harvinder			
Singh 			
Mukesh Kumar in possession 			
Mounting the attack for Indian Airlines is Rajinder Singh			
there 			
Given on to Jagbir Singh 			
Good afternoon and uh greetings to Doordarshan			
 viewers and uh welcome to the Shiv Chhatrapati sport city			
 at Balewadi the outskirts of uh Pune 			
Uh Pune of course one considers something to a paradise and			
uh the speech of course dedicated to the late Rajiv Gandhi the			
former prime minister of India on his uh fiftieth uh birthday 			
The uh city of course has been indeed one professional paradise			
 is uh today labelled as a sport city and uh has been the hosting of			
uh the International Marathon over the last ten years 			
Uh we also witnessed the third National Games successfully 			
concluded at the start of the year 			
And uh we're now watching the start of the Seventh			
International uh uh Permit Meet here at the Shiv Chhatrapati 			
Sport City Complex 			
Uh Just before we uh came onto the air we spoke to the			
President of the uh Amateur Athletic Federation of India uh Mr Suresh			
Kalmadi 			
The president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India and uh			
he is responsible for the Seventh International Permit Meet here in Pune 			
Mr Suresh Kalmadi			
Mr Kalmadi nervous 			
Not at all fully prepared 			
Uh tell me the meet for the first time is being held in			
Pune why is that you got it here ?			
Well uh Pune has got this beautiful sport city and			
 manifold athelitic stadium with uh synthetic tract			
So we thought uh this sport city should have first			
international event in the form of a permit meet 			
Plus the track at Jawaharlal Nehru stadium at New Delhi			
 is not up the mark we've been asking them to lay a new			
track till they lay a new track we can not have a international meet			
there 			
Uh you are also asking uh looking forward to recognition			
from the world for the grand feat 			
Now uh in case and uh we are wishful and hopeful that you			
get it next year 			
Would you then be holding it here ?			
Well uh that will have to be decided by the federation			
Uh we are in a run for the grand feat you are aware			
that uh Mr Primo Nebolio is the world president in the			
last meeting he had said that the grand feat will be extended			
to Asia and he has named India and Japan as the next country 			
where the grand feat will be held 			
So then this time athletic come to India and you see 			
lot of us uh champions coming here as part of their routine they			
will have to come here 			
So earn their points point world wise 			
So that will be really good 			
And talking of this uh permit meet what do we have in			
store ?			
Well uh this is uh no doubt the greatest 			
athletic event so far held in India 			
 We've never had the level of competition we will be			
seeing here today 			
We have got over ten world champions here and the			
competition is going to be so good because a very good crop of athletes			
are here today 			
You are aware that Carl Lewis and Merlene Ottey are heading the 			
list of world champions 			
We have started this permit meet not to give so much			
competition to Indian but to popularise athletics in the country 			
We as a country go more to cricket as if we've 			
been just watching the match 			
But I think what is needed today two words for			
athletes that more attention to be put to athletics that's 			
why we get people like Carl Lewis and Merlene Ottey here 			
So the youngster in this country look towards Olympic spot 			
And uh obviously uh you are also looking at uh 			
this as a preparation for the Indian contingent for the uh Asian			
games			
 That's right 			
You see luckily this timed well so the Indian team is uh on			
its last lap to the Asian games Hiroshima they are going to get			
tremendous competition here especially Bahudar Prasad and Shiny			
Ibrahim Saramma Shakti Singh uh also relay teams will get tremendous			
 uh competition here today 			
So it will be very good uh for them at the Asian games 			
where the standard of the Asian games will not be as high as the standard			
you will see here today			
Mr Kalmadi thank you very much			
We wish you the very best and we hope that under your guidance			
 Indian athletes continue to grow from stature to stature thank			
you very much			
Thank you 			
Well uh the uh guest of honour uh Shri 			
Vidya Charan Shukla the Union Minister for water resources along with uh			
 uh Shri Mukul Vasnik the Union Minister for sports and			
cultural affairs uh are here 			
The festivities would get under way soon 			
Uh but uh to uh tell you what scheme store over the next four			
hours uh is my colleague commentator John Castro 			
This Seventh edition of the I T C international is an			
inspirational excercise 			
Bringing these foreign athletes to India is basically to			
give them an exposure where watching the others in action and			
running aganist them will help our own boys and girls 			
These men and women who are representing India both in			
India and abroad to do better 			
Now it's very obvious that Indian athletes 			
rarely get a chance to take their to take part against some of the best			
performers in the world 			
Now this happens in this I T C meet where you have			
world champions olympic champions and uh some of the best performers			
 in the grand feat circuit 			
And the exposure definitely is helpful			
And which especially in this exercise with the Asian games			
coming around the corner the exposure will certainly help our men			
and women to hopefully do better because whatever performances			
 we record here then probably the same could come at Hiroshima or even			
better because all depending on the morale			
Well John just breaking away from you for a movement			
These are the uh girls from Dastur High School Pune 			
Hundred of them and uh they start the march past 			
 They're going to display the rainbow uh the colours			
which we all know as VIBGYOR 			
As the cheer goes up for a fine display we are marching			
 as one would say kadam se kadam milaye jaa 			
the band in attendance here is uh from the National Defence Academy 			
uh just a few kilometres away from the sports complex 			
And uh along with the band from the National Defence Academy uh			
is the band of the Maratha light infantry Belgaum 			
The band masters uh Subedar Major Sumer Singh and band			
master Subedar Major uh Kishan Shetty 			
They are playing kadam badhaye ja 			
We have a host of dignitories present here 			
And I said earlier on the guest of honour the uh			
Honourable Minister for water resources uh Shri 			
Vidyacharan Shukla along with uh uh Shri Mukul			
Vasnik the Union Minister for sports are here 			
And this is the march past 			
John a little deviation they're marching in a jumbled			
formation 			
Yeah because uh it's uh just had especially we			
have an opening ceremony in say the Asians games or the Olympic			
games 			
But here more it is a friendly exercise but of course 			
not in competition 			
That is why it is uh it has been decided here that they			
walk uh without the regular marching regimentation that we have			
normally 			
Well a broad moment for the girls and that's the 			
section of the V I P box uh you watch uh the Union Minister for			
water resources Shri Vidya Charan Shukala uh along with			
Mukul Vasnik the president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India 			
 Shri uh Suresh Kalmadi 			
The uh G O C M C southern command Lieutenant General Moti Dhar is			
also here 			
Six from Belarus two from Belgium six from China John			
there you are for the first time 			
Yes the Chinese are here for the first time and you we			
really do not know much about their performances			
It is when you ask them something about what they're 			
really doing they don't understand our language 			
Yes we're certainly uh look for a surprise and			
 that's VIBGYOR which goes up for the uh Indian contingent 			
This is a big meet for them 			
Just a few weeks uh before they depart for the Asian Games in			
uh Hiroshima uh P T Usha the darling of the crowd she is there 			
 She's going to be running today as well along with uh			
 Shiny Wilson and uh 			
And of course you can't miss out uh Bahadur Prasad who's			
 won laurel's uh for India in the International Circuit 			
A proud moment for the girls from Dastur High School Pune a			
hundred strong as they march up in unison and uh that goes			
to prove that uh we in India are all one as they march together			
This Indian team which is here comprises those 			
who're going to Hiroshima as well as some of the prominent			
youngsters who are in the A A F I camp that's the Amateur			
Athletic Federation of India camp those youngsters are getting the			
exposure so that uh they also get a chance amongst against these			
world champions and it could helpful be helpful 			
 to them 			
Between John yes uh this is uh the thing in the right			
direction isn't it ?			
Right you have to give them exposure well as cheer or with			
applaud and thankfully are the Indian athlete have had the quite			
a good measure of exposure in Europe and elsewhere this season and			
hopefully they should uh come with some medals at uh from			
Hisroshima like at Beijing where it was all silver and a couple			
of bronze 			
But uh this time we are expecting better much uh you			
also have to be a very realistic about the fact that the Chinese and			
the athlete from the Middle East have uh gone away away from us			
and uh it is going to be difficult 			
John the presence of uh Carl Lewis and uh Merlene Ottey			
here is certainly going to be a big inspiration uh not only for the			
athlete but uh the thousands of youngsters who have gathered 			
To Kipta I mean Kiptanui the uh Moses Kiptanui of			
Kenya 			
He is the world record holder for the two miles and uh			
also for the two thousand metres in one word and he will be			
running here shortly this afternoon 			
He says my hero is a few words who came to India			
 and previously in previous years and he says that in Kenya we			
all these old athletes who are greats and greats in their own way 			
as ideal which is at one time I used to look to Crieno 			
And uh my ideal and uh first to do I'd like to feel			
like and today he says everybody in Kenya says we'd like to			
be like Moses Kiptanui if he is wearing a new hairstyle then but uh			
 you'd like to see him better when he runs 			
Well they all trooping in here the youngsters uh 			
along with the mothers and I'm sure they are going to be the 			
stars of the future 			
They are coming here to watch the big stars in action 			
 They're going to go back home wondering what they			
must do 			
And uh we have the president of the Amateur Athletic			
Federation of India Mr Suresh Kalmadi now addressing the uh athletes			
Well that was uh Mr Suresh Kalmadi the president of the uh			
 Amateur Athletic Federation of India 			
Uh his words uh to the congregation here at uh the Sports			
Complex 			
A complex which of course uh is a city by itself with uh			
so many beautiful stadium uh which are capable of hosting almost 			
all the sports			
During the last National Games the last National Games which were			
held in uh uh January uh start of the year uh only six of			
them were held in uh Bombay 			
Mr Mukal Vasnik the Union Minister for sport uh looking at a			
vision in the distant future 			
Uh he spoke of a four year plan for all the federations of			
sports 			
And uh this mission would take India from uh strength to			
strength as we march on into the 			
And uh the national record is in the name of Shakti Singh at			
uh sixty-one point seven two 			
We are watching the start of the women's three hundred			
metres 			
Which has two Indians here 			
We have Rosa Kutty we got Shiny Wilson 			
Now that's the well Shiny Wilson has got about 			
a good rate yesterday where you have some good athletes you come to			
win here again come to gain gold medal 			
 A few words 			
Chinese second position at the moment 			
But the national record is in the name of Jyoti Sikdar			
 at two minutes O one point six zero a beat record in the name of			
Yuan Grabbermine of Germany 			
 It's very hot chase 			
Very hard chase this 			
Katherine Maenhout Belgium in the first position at the			
moment 			
Shiny Wilson in third position 			
Shiny coming up now let us see what she is going to do now 			
Oh that looked like big break of Shiny Wilson and let's			
 see now whether she is going through 			
Striding strongly is Natalia Dukhnova she's 			
second in the world championship silver medalist in the world			
championship 			
And Shiny going for all she can 			
 She's done better in uh Europeans on European			
circuit and it's Shi Shiny 			
can do it just now 			
Dukhnova striding back Shiny also coming through only a little			
bit more for a stride got through the back stride very close 			
but she just cannot make it 			
 That's Dukhnova Natalia the second in the world			
championship and champion here the one with the dark glasses 			
number two two six Natalia Dukhnova of Belarus 			
Second close second was Shiny Wilson 			
Normally Shiny never comes up with such a finish but it			
definitely looks like that she has improved in the finishing business 			
And the European circuit has done her well			
Well that's the action replay for you I think Shiny			
is starting a wee bit uh at the bitter end and uh Dukhnova			
of Belarus full of experience striding away 			
It looked so near for Shiny but uh it wasn't to be as uh			
 Natalia Dukhnova of Belarus there she breaks the tape now to win			
the women's eight hundred metres final and uh edging out 			
Shiny Wilson from India and to complete uh the event uh in third spot			
was uh Cydesen Karen of Denmark 			
So the teams here uh taking there first medal 			
And we're watching the uh prize distribution of the			
 women's four hundred metres 			
The uh prizes being handed out the medals by the Union			
Minister for sports Shri Mukul Vasnik uh to Anja Rooker			
of Germany who won with the time of fifty-two point two zero 			
Richa Hedid of the United States fifty-two point five eight			
takes the silver 			
And Bi Ziagun of China coming in third spot uh 			
happiness all over her face fifty-two point nine zero 			
And uh that certainly makes a very happy picture for uh the			
albums of these three athletes posing with uh Shri Mukul			
Vasnik the youthful minister for sports 			
Remember we are here at uh the Shri Shiv			
Chattrapati Sports City in Pune for the seventh addition of the			
International Permit Meet 			
Held on six earlier occasion in uh New Delhi at the			
Jawaharlal Nehru stadium 			
And uh it's this is the first time that uh it being			
hosted at Pune 			
As we move over to the uh men's discus 			
A hundred and seventy-one Ajit Bahduria of India 			
The crowds on their toes at the far end trying to see the			
 finest athletes uh in action 			
 That's Ajit Bahduria with the discus 			
Jurgen Schultz the world record holder much expected from			
him 			
And uh these children in colourful clothes just going off your			
screen watching uh Jurgen Schultz at the discus 			
interruption 			
We had a very colourful opening uh today here at Pune			
 That's Jurgen Schultz a fine action replay his			
uh body coordination 			
 That's what has made him uh record holder at the			
discus in the world and the Germans have always dominated this event			
 interrupton 			
They all set for the eight hundred metres which has			
record Olympic champion William Tanui in full black 			
Willaim Tanui is one great sensational runner alternating			
between the eight hundred and the fifteen hundred metres 			
 It's unfortunate that Paul Ruto expected here didn't			
finally come 			
Otherwise it would have been a sensational race between one			
the world champion and the other the Olympic champion 			
But we have William Tanui here and in the interruption			
 here the six uh we have two Indian runners Avtaar Singh the best			
for the four hundred metres in India and Jercy Matthew 			
They are organised deliberately put put both of these			
Indian runners together in three hundred because Avtaar Singh			
probably could come in in the relay basically the relay for			
India is very important four by two hundred metres relay and of course			
both the women four by hundred and four by two hundred metres relay			
And just for the statistical minded the meet record in			
the name of Billa Contella of Kenya one minute forty-five point nine			
three and uh once again surprising John the Indian record still 			
quite old Shri Ram Sing one forty-five point seven seven			
Yeah they don't make them like Shri Ram			
Singh and Milkha Singh these days 			
Well alternatively we also have the women's long jump			
 at the other end but we shift our attention to the men's 			
eight hundred metres all is set now and uh 			
Just look out for that man in the full black William Tanui			
If Natalia Dukhnova uh went full ahead after the first lap			
in full red 			
This time it is William Tanui in full black			
But mind you there are five Kenyans in this race			
You really can't say about these Kenyans 			
They just run and run 			
There goes the start interruption 			
The first hundred on the track and then shifting it by when			
you cut into the first lane 			
William Tanui in third position at the moment 			
Two Kenyans in the track 			
But looks like Vincent Malakawen and Henry Lebo 			
But running very easily is William Tanui the man in full black			
 applause interruption 			
You see that old bunch of there and here is Avtaar Singh coming			
in there on your screen interruption 			
First is the Kenyan interruption 			
Now look in second position William Tanui interruption			
Here is they all running crowded interruption 			
Now that is William Tanui now 			
Two hundred metres free row 			
Another Kenyan in the front let's see now whether 			
it's going to be like Kiptanui who was beaten but this time 			
William Tanui still there applaud interruption 			
Oh the great fight between three Kenyan 			
William Tanui has fallen behind and another one has come			
through at number one one two interruption 			
Robert Kibbet of Kenya was a surprise winner here 			
So as uh they say in Kenya one runner after another comes			
through so here is another champion coming 			
Now look at this Robert Kibbet coming from behind 			
He was in third position and he stretch right through 			
and went on to first position 			
William Tanui came in too late 			
He did manage to come through to second position but Kibbet			
had made the break through at the right moment and thus Robert			
Kibbet the winner of the eight hundred metres 			
But you couldn't have asked for any finer isn't it John ?			
Oh yeah it's because uh they keep saying in the			
interview last evening both this uh uh Kip Tanui and William			
Tanui that you can never say in Kenya who can win and who can't 			
today and who can win tomorrow 			
Well that's the stuff that the Kenyans are made up of			
 and there they are the three of them acknowledging the greetings			
from uh this very hospitable crowd here in Pune 			
I think they will be acknowledging everything that has been good			
 and I think uh John this has been the best race of the day so far			
Yes this was a very good race because uh he came right			
from the outside and came in 			
Well what is it that uh makes the Kenyans uh keep on			
clicking in these races ?			
Now recording broken 			
Well it's going to be Steve Watt continue from			
the score board end 			
 Men's javeline uh as we welcome you viewers uh			
 back to the Shiv Chhattrapati Sports Complex and here is 			
Vladimir Dubrovschik he has the personal best of sixty-eight point eight			
zero metres and he's really gone mad because he			
obviously has shown he can be a discus to the best stretch 			
Well John I think he's happy because that's 			
what happened he won look likes the discus edging out the hot			
favourite Jurgen Schultz of Germany and over the last ten to fifteen			
minutes he has been full of joy and ecstasy 			
 He's taken out two or three of his T-shirts and given			
them away to the crowd 			
And the joy is written clearly all over his face and body 			
For a man of his stature top as he is now he is doing the			
laugh of honour Vladimir Dubrovschik of the Ukraine 			
And what a happy moment this is for him 			
Well the Germans have been a great favourite in the discus but			
uh it's uh an upset for uh the Germans here 			
Jurgen Schultz beaten by his own game Toto of mix one			
word 			
And that that will be victory ceremony for the men's long			
jump			
The winner once more a Chinese Lan Jong of China clearing			
seven point eight two metres 			
So the Chines uh bringing a few surprises John 			
In second spot Vladimir Maleiwind of Turkmenistan 			
seven point seven seven metres 			
And uh taking the bronze uh the jumper from Oman Ahmed 			
Obed Bashir seven point four five metres 			
So the uh Chinese uh continuing with the success story here at			
the Shri Shiv Chattrapati Sports City winning one more gold medal			
And uh that's the finish of the women's fifteen			
hundred metres which uh ended in victory for the Irish girl Sonia			
 O'Sullivan the hot favourite for this event as John describe			
earlier on 			
Yeah Sonia O'Sullivan has has gone to win 			
but I would like to after since she has is in the way to winning			
streak at the moment 			
And you can see what a lovely play she over through to Roja			
Kutty and then third to run and of course two words she was			
the only challenger for her and she kept away two words as			
well 			
That was the women's 			
Seven of them in contention 			
Three from India Jagjit Singh Tony Verghese and			
uh Satbir Singh 			
The uh national record is in the name of Satbir Singh			
seventy-five point two two			
 Let's pick up action in the women's uh uh			
long jump 			
Elena Govorou of Ukraine she's on your			
screen now 			
The uh women's uh long jump record the uh meet			
record in the name of Lalita Brednaya of Russia six point eight nine			
 Let's get back to men's juveline again 			
Two of the field events uh going on at uh the same time at			
different parts of the ground 			
The women's uh long jump and uh the men's			
 juveline 			
Well we coming on late 			
The other meet is coming on now first will be the B wing			
And then we come on straight Carl Lewis Emmanuel Tuffour of			
Ghana 			
Well while we are at the men's juveline uh we			
and uh while we did describe about Merelene Ottey holding on to uh 			
the women's two hundred metres where uh it was expected from			
her 			
There has been an upset in men's discus which we announced			
earlier on and uh the winner there the official result having			
come in is uh Vladimir Dubrovschik in eight metres 			
And uh he upset the apple cart with uh Nick Winnie of			
Irelend finishing second sixty-one point nine two and uh the German			
the world record holder Jurgen Schultz uh in third spot sixty-one point			
three eight 			
So on a day when Merelene Ottey John held on to the			
expected title Jurgen Schultz has lost out			
Jurgen Schultz uh did say but he was not in the best			
streak of the moment and he was not throwing the seventy-four which			
he felt when he set the world record in nineteen eighty-seven 			
but uh he himself did not dream that he could throw seventy-four point			
zero eight 			
And even convinced I beleive for the judges were lying when			
they said that that was the world record 			
But Jurgen Schultz as I said earlier is alternating between			
 grip practices for the discus throw and also in his sports			
promotion business because as he said I want to get money because			
uh he doesn't make as much money as the Carl Lewis or Sir Jack 			
Whooker 			
Well John uh the action is now centred at uh 			
The hundred metre			
 That's right the blue ribband of uh all			
athletic races and the name which is uh going to be there where all			
eyes are going to be focused is uh the eight times Olympic gold			
medal winner and uh the same time that he won the world championship 			
uh Carlson Fredrick Lewis better known to all of us as Carl Lewis 			
He is uh drawn in the second of the uh men's one			
hundred metres 			
The uh You have Permit meet record for the			
hundred metres in the name of uh Thomas Jefferson another fine U S			
athlete set way back in nineteen eighty-nine ten point two zero 			
And uh the Indian record in the name of R uh Gyanshekaran 			
uh ten point six zero 			
 You have 			
Now in the first hundred metres which is schedule for now 			
you have two Oman runners and in lane three you have Gurvinder Singh			
 of India 			
Now these 			
And I was telling you uh you have two runners from Oman 			
in this first three hundred metres race 			
And these Oman runners are good uh for the four			
hundred eight hundred fifteen hundred but uh these days uh in the			
Middle East we are having some of the best best coaches from abroad to			
push their talent 			
But you could expect uh some of these boys to do well 			
in uh the Asian Games at Hiroshima 			
This uh first race in the hundred metres of course will be uh			
 just uh a teaser for you because in the next one comes Carl			
Lewis Patrick Stevens Emmanuel Tuffour Donald and Sherry all great			
sprinters today on the grand Prix circuit 			
Patrick Stevens of Belgium 			
Well John if you remember uh uh there can always be an			
upset if you remember one of the first but uh beaten by a lesser known			
 Austr Austria 			
 Aust 			
As uh I as Carl himself said I know that the			
contest is going to be very good 			
And this boy from Ghana Emmanuel Tuffour running in lane five			
 for that kick ten 			
And here is the victory ceremony for the eight hundred metres			
You have Shiny Wilson the the former record holder for the			
event which she lost when Jyoti Mohit Sikdar set the new record at			
 the European circuit 			
Well there is the winner of the women's eight hundred			
metres Natalia Dukhnova of uh Belarus two minutes zero two			
point one zero second 			
And what a fine run she had sporting the uh very famous			
sunglasses uh which has now become a part of International sport 			
whether it's athletics football or cricket 			
Shiny Wilson uh second with two minutes O two point three two			
And uh Shiny gets a a warm kiss from uh the one who			
finished first in the race 			
And that's the bronze medal winner uh Cydesen Karen of			
Denmark the Dane winning uh coming in third spot two minutes O			
seven point three one second 			
All squad there in fact everybody thinking as Gurvinder			
Singh in the screen from India 			
He is one of the upcoming hundred metres runners 			
John and this reminds us of uh the man who lit the flame			
today uh the man who held his national record and the title for a			
long long time Adil Somadiwala isn't it ?			
Yeah 			
We have a Chinese in lane five 			
Now let's see what this Chinese man is going to			
do because already the Chinese have shown even with the very			
few that have come out to Pune here that uh they have some good			
stuff in their country even present uh well uh they are going to			
do or not uh well uh I mean uh they have not got of course the best			
from out there 			
But even those that have come here have done well 			
John the Americans have all these uh health way in the 			
hundred metres strength for 			
Yes of course 			
You see has come in 			
And of course uh everybody has read that uh Dimple			
Christly incidently is also from Jamaica but now uh is uh			
settled in England 			
And a good one word citizen today 			
And another name which we can't forget is Baleri Bourgoef			
with one hundred and two hundred 			
Yeah the only Russian to be a sprinter which gone			
 who has become immortal because he came out at the time when the			
American were in full sway 			
Rajiv Balakrishnan from India 			
He is running in the hundred metres here 			
Rajiv Balakrishnan is not on the list of runners but uh			
 he is doing the hundred metres free race 			
And let's see if he he could come in because he			
is training more for the two hundred metres because uh if the Indian			
team goes to Hiroshima then Rajiv Balakrishnan will run both the 			
fou hundred four hundred metres relay as well as the four hundred			
metres uh 			
So let's see if he can win this the hundred metres			
free race uh in the National games here interruption 			
 That's one close start Rajiv Balakrishnan and			
 that's Gurvinder Singh in your feature screen 			
The Chinese there also 			
John and the tension Lying it's not			
only on the athletes but everyone out here as well 			
 Lying 			
Yeah the hundred metre is always does that to everybody 			
because that is the race everybody looks ahead to and uh of course			
that is a day of great spectacle in any athletic meeting 			
anywhere in the world 			
There is another Chinese in the second hundred metres race as			
well and that is that tall person standing behind in second lane			
 waiting for his trial to come over 			
And the Chinese in the first year in this race you can			
see in lane two 			
 That's Merlene Ottey is here 			
Sweet talking to the sports men of Slovak Vasnaik 			
applause 			
It looks like the Chinese in the front here is the great			
fight between Korea yes it is looks like that the Chinese China			
athlete who has won 			
And he did it so nicely one hundred and ten 			
Strangely enough his name is not on the list of			
competitors			
Yeah 			
That was Rajiv Balkrishnan in the blue shorts one seven			
five 			
And here is the replay 			
On the first lane is uh Al Maksai Saidewoma and			
the Chinese runner down in the middle with Gurvinder Singh 			
struggling there to keep in the forefront 			
And look at the end as the Chinese runner surges ahead

free hit to Air India free hit going over the sideline on the			
hit in for Punjab Sindh bank 			
Nearly twenty one minutes of play gone through Air India			
 leading by a goal 			
Score in the seventeenth minutes of first half by Aranha and			
for the continuation of commentary in Hindi it is Abhay Chaturvedi 			
 In India 			
Abhay I would just like to say one thing five of the 			
interrupt land 			
For the Air India team now Darryl D'Souza and 			
Edgar Mascarenhas they are infact trained as defendant 			
But these are the two players who besides being playing as			
defendants they are always leading the attack 			
And they are always keeping them forward on the move whereas			
 there in the Punjab Sindh bank team the size of these a few			
words is very long 			
Ah Ramsharan Gundeep Ripudaman 			
They have not been able to combine well whereas the Air India			
forward they're just lurking near the goal mark 			
They just get hardly chance at the two words 			
They would have been thrown up but for Aranha that you cast in			
last line who catches the one with one day and centrally			
 one word feeling I don't know whether you agree with me or not			
Punjab Sindh bank having nearly five internationals is			
kill their act			
But I think over confident must have started with that 			
And this is what you are paying for your over confidence 			
And so far they have not been able to combine well and all the			
players played so far ah practically you a few words 			
Before we leave on to catch the relay a few words 			
I was considering they got just four chances 			
And out of the four chances they converted three 			
Fourth one was Edward Aranha a ball going just by yard 			
otherwise the goal keeper was awake there was no one to 			
To me it appears the Punjab Sind bank defence does not know			
what it was to be 			
They are running everywhere but not marking defence 			
Who lies the whole side Aranha here follows Rajesh			
Chouhan and Darryl D'Souza Alex D'Souza all coming			
into the attack nobody is marking 			
They come into the attack and immediately don't go back 			
That only shows their partners their thinking which the			
Punjab Sindh bank boys two words 			
The two words 			
And they are more uh selfish 			
If Ramsharan gets the ball he goes down the left flank he			
doesn't look for a opening they are along with him 			
Same is the case with uh uh Gundeep they have got a			
very good chance and Gundeep has given a back pass to Ramsharan 			
A swing way down the near the right back line 			
And from here specially 			
Once they go after the back line they are tied because they			
can't do it 			
Now here is the Punjab players back on the crease			
 			
The leading team has to prove a few words playing			
final of the third Lala Bhim Sain memorial invitation hockey tournament			
 at Shivaji stadium 			
Venue of many international tournament 			
The Punjab Sindh bank boys just relaxing but no			
strategy is being formed 			
Again on your same replaying Delhi policeman In			
Hindi 			
Punjab Sindh bank going into the field 			
Now the second half will start 			
Abhay the three goal lead in the final 			
 It's a very great moral boosting 			
In fact Punjab Sindh bank was expected to do very			
well 			
Played very well 			
For them it is demoralising 			
In second half we'll have to see whether they would be			
able to recapture their form and fight back 			
Yes they have thirty-five minutes or so 			
Because one can't imagine that the Punjab Sindh bank			
won't come back into the game 			
They have the capacity they have the capability but the			
only thing is they will have to stretch during individual approach 			
and combined and move ahead with a combined move 			
Here are they Air India team on the screen and number			
eight 			
Where 			
This Rajinder Amar on the right side of the screen			
 with yellow shirts is the Punjab Sindh bank team and right in the			
middle with the red shirts on the right is T S Bullard the			
international umpire and on his right is Kukoo Walia another			
international umpire 			
Now there goes the scene form rest of the day I shall			
 suppose the former Lieutenant Governor of Delhi 			
The Punjab Sindh bank team being introduced to him 			
This is Narender former international umpire 			
Sorry here is Bullard the international umpire Kukoo			
Walia 			
And now the Air India team 			
Edgar Mascarenhas now introducing his boys to the			
former Lieutenant Governor H K L Kapoor to his team mates from Air			
India 			
The four teams presented with the souvenir of this tournament			
All there is over the two teams take their			
respective places 			
Punjab Sindh bank will attack from right to left 			
Now already down by three goals 			
They will have to work very hard to get back into the game			
And the morals of the Air India boys is very high 			
And one thing very notable that the Air India defences they			
are marking their players very well 			
They are not letting the rafter Gundeep and uh Ripudaman 			
Ball on to the side and they know the passing would be			
given to one of them and they are marking it very well 			
All the attempt of Punjab Sindh bank to pass on the ball			
 to either Ramsharan Gundeep or Ripudaman are being frustrated by			
the passmanship of the well marked passing by the defenders			
 of Air India 			
Air India to start on the second half 			
Edward Aranha with the ball the one who scored the first two			
goals in the seventeen and twenty-third minutes the third goal coming of			
that stick of Rajesh Chauhan in the thirty-third the first half			
itself 			
Back pass Chauhan to Harpreet on to the right for			
Clive D'Souza 			
 That's superb 			
Good take work 			
To Darryl Darryl gives it to Mascarenhas Edgar now from			
there to Rajesh Chauhan good shot but it fine play by goalkeeper			
Teja 			
Corner hit by him			
Mascarenhas free hit Air India 			
Between the a few words 			
Aimless forward pass over the backline 			
Ripudaman Rajinder quick pass to Gundeep Pasha side			
by umpire Kukoo Walia 			
Free hit for Air India 			
First hit for the in the first second half itself by Punjab			
Sindh bank that showed their determination now 			
But lets see 			
Rajinder Gundeep keeps at the ball free hit for Air			
India ball with Darryl D'Souza Darryl D'Souza 			
forward to Aranha Aranha to Alex D'Souza 			
 D'Souza to Aranha 			
 In Hindi 			
Another Arjun award winner this Sandhya Agarwal 			
And of course we have the cricketing manager of the Indian side 			
uh the third Arjun award winner Santarangaswamy managing this team 			
Diana Eduljee 			
Quite a delivery indeed but the batsman there on the crease			
 unable to study the ball unable to read the ball are not			
taking chances of leaving the crease 			
Diana 			
Left arm round on the leg stump 			
No attempt for a shot 			
And thirty nineth over completed with Diana completing her sixth			
over two maiden ten runs and one wicket 			
In just misfield you see Franklin and Jose now discussing as to the			
strategy what should be adopted at this stage of the game			
The fortieth over will be in progress			
The run rate here as given by our scorer immediately and			
 it's two point four one 			
Two point four one			
A very low rate of scoring 			
Not a recitable total to bowl at			
And Australia will have to do something about it right now 			
before it's too late to recover from the say of ninety-four for			
six 			
Pramila 			
See it's Pramila from the Darya Ganj end Amar 			
Yeah 			
And still a spin attack going on although there is a slight			
breeze on the uh ground today 			
A little breeze the flag swinging the flag are waving and you can			
see that the pacers although not very successful they haven't been			
operated for a long time 			
 It's the spinners who are taking the field today 			
And first ball fro from Pramila			
 going away from the point 			
Two runs three runs 			
Uh ninety-seven Franklin moves on to eight ninety-seven for six			
The fortieth over in progress 			
How many overs have all today could you let me know number of			
overs the pacers bowl today 			
So it's uh			
One three O five 			
Five overs five overs each			
Five each ten 			
So ten overs have been bowled by the pacers			
See it's Pramila the right arm spinner 			
And the leg stump ball punished but Diana right there 			
The stroke coming in directly to the wicket keeper's hand			
And the Australian run restricted to only two 			
Only one run being taken ninety-eight for six 			
Wonderful throw from the boundary line 			
For Franklin and Jose we have told you about the 			
achievements of Franklin young player an upcoming player from the			
Australian squad who ha who are visiting India for			
the first of the match in the series 			
Here is Pramila right arm elbow moved up and on			
the off stump first into the covers 			
A little misfielding 			
Single there ninety-nine 			
Quicking towards that wretched mark of hundred but number			
of overs bowled a little too many for this total ninety-nine for			
six 			
Appeal Jose out			
And the appeal there 			
The response is positive by the umpire 			
You see the batsman returning 			
And Abhay what do you think of this ball ?			
Jose goes back for total of individual total of seventeen			
 this this session always necessary to know what type of			
bowling is there and she has come on last evening say she is a 			
off spinner 			
She is very success successful 			
bowler in the nineteen ninety-three World Cup where she had a 			
very good throw with wonderful fielding 			
She is a very good fielder also 			
And she is coming up from the Darya Ganj end 			
She gave her to guess that sneak off Jose and Anju Jain was			
right there behind the stump collecting it 			
Anju you can see her there now reaching which is behind			
Franklin 			
And that's a wonderful shot off the toes turning the			
body a little bit and uh between the mid wicket and mid on 			
Three runs 			
They wouldn't go for the fourth 			
A very fast running between the wickets 			
Before Aarti Vaidya return to ball three runs added			
Hundred completed for Australia 			
Hundred and two in forty point two overs and time taken of			
course time is not required in the over match 			
And now we can get a little flavour of the one day match 			
being played here between India and Australia 			
Very good delivery bringing in the ball a little Diana			
Eduljee 			
For a minute difficult to suspend 			
Very articulate vital spot read the batting and			
there she is frightened one this time 			
Two fielders outside that white line 			
Faster one 			
Not bowling to the field			
At the moment the faster one wanted to see how the batman 			
ca respond to such delivery the long off and long on kept but			
 the last delivery was flatter and faster 			
And batsman number eight has twelve runs to the credit and			
the 			
By the spinners and of course the spinners have been doing			
remarkably well in this match 			
Franklin taking T S Pramila 			
Pramila is the captain of the champion side which won the			
Rani Jhansi Trophy the Air India team and this is T S Pramila 			
Another mis- fielding 			
Little bit of mis-fielding there at mid wicket and before the ball			
is retrieved by Lea Francis one run added hundred and three for seven			
Franklin thirteen 			
Valuable thirteen valuable runs at this stage 			
Although the rate of scoring is low 			
Australia now moving up on to the target for better total 			
The weather brightening up a little the sun streaking in 			
and just when the lunch break is coming the weather 			
improving 			
T S Pramila bowling Franklin 			
Quick 			
Bright facing T S Pramila 			
Bright she is giving all the strike to Franklin 			
And Bright played this ball uncomfortably losing her			
balance going on the off side and not being able to maintain her			
balance to go for any type of stroke 			
See here Pramila elbow high right arm going over			
 and this one bringing this one ball from the off stump so			
as it has to turn a little before she could try this ball 			
But not a good choice to get her fetch her any run 			
The score remains at hundred and three for seven 			
The forty second over being bowled 			
Slightly delivery on the off stump but a vast covers head 			
Two runs easily 			
The cover being too close not moving behind fast enough to			
get underneath the ball two runs added to the total hundred and five for			
seven 			
The forty first to point two overs at the moment the score			
is hundred and five for seven 			
Diana Eduljee that mesmerising left arm spinner of India 			
operating from the club house end 			
On the leg stump 			
A lovely bit of fielding indeed 			
And I think the Indian squad now with a little bit of strike			
from the Australian side has awakened up to good fielding			
And Ria Sen good cricket after a long time 			
A little subdued moving that has gone brightening up now 			
Short pitch right there in the middle 			
Fielded no run as Aarti Bajaj mid off 			
Left arm going round 			
Not a good contact and finally Shastri there at mid wicket at			
the square leg 			
The bat and the ball not in a perfect condition of contact 			
Uh delivery on the leg side open up too early the batsman open			
up too early uh and uh another uncomfortable defensive half defensive			
stroke didn't go for a hit neither did she come for a forward			
defence 			
Hundred and five for seven 			
Bright two Franklin 			
Attempted cut and of course successful with it 			
Two before the ball is retrieved by Aarti Vaidya and			
returned to the wicket keeper 			
Two uh added to the total of Australian total of hundred and five			
Now hundred and seven for seven 			
Hundred and seven for seven three wickets remaining two overs			
remaining 			
This forty fourth over being bowled 			
T S Pramila from the Darya Ganj end bowling to Bright			
Faster delivery and came in straight to the keepers hand 			
Anju unable to read that delivery of Pramila came off herself			
Lucky not to get it touched it with Bright 			
Variations in Pramila's delivery the last one came in			
The last of her delivery bringing in the nineth over with two			
maiden sixteen runs being given away she's captured one wicket			
so far 			
At delivery and that is the intelligence Diana applies			
whenever she bowls to cricketers bowl to the opposite side 			
She is always leading the batsman she saw batsman ready for			
setting out and uh coming close to the ball and uh here she is 			
with that classic delivery of hers in the last over 			
So Franklin returned to the pavillion at the score of			
hundred and seven 			
And here is the last wicket 			
So it's Collin Rose Collin at the crease now to face			
Diana 			
Five balls remaining 			
 Two words one day international women's 			
cricket match which is being played between India and Australia 			
Welcome to the Nehru Stadium where the second one day			
international between India and Australia is taking place 			
We are with you when the third over is taking place 			
And Rose Collin just about to bowl the third over 			
This is the first ball in the third over a beautiful ball it			
is 			
And I must tell you my co commentator today is a great			
cricketer Chandu Sarvate who is going to give you the 			
commentary in Hindi in the second one day international match 			
The first ball from the Australians where India took three			
runs			
And after that in the second over was a maiden over			
And this is the third over the second ball of the third over 			
It is Anju Jain who is facing Rose Collins			
No runs to be taken 			
And it's a the Australians w have already			
proved their ability in the fielding in fielding as well as they have			
done a good bit of bowling in the end 			
And this Rose Collin who will be operating the opening			
bowler 			
She is operating from the club house end 			
The morning is bright and sunny and just lovely for cricket 			
So this is going to be a fifty over match each side 			
Three overs there is third over being bowled five runs			
And uh the Indian batsman now facing Rose Collins is			
Aarti Vaidya the left handed batsman 			
And this girl Rose Collins has been swirving the ball 			
with this weather and have been able to really disturb the batsman			
from the very first over 			
A six footer she said her mother is six feet four inches 			
and quite a good height for a pace baller 			
I must tell you about this girl Rose Collins who got a			
very good average in the first one day international 			
Six overs two maiden she has given only sixteen runs 			
The runs given away matters in the one day international 			
The bowler from the other end is now Joe Grace 			
In the first one day international it was Anjelo O'Neil 			
from the other end			
But now it is Joe Grace who is bowling from the hospital end			
Five for no loss			
India five for no loss 			
Facing is Aarti Vaidya and the bowler at the other end is			
 Joe Grace 			
Joe Grace's average in the Delhi one day when she			
came in to bowl after five bowlers her average was seven overs four			
maiden eight runs and two wickets 			
And that effort of hers has brought her into the opening			
bowling stand and she is bowling from the hospital end now 			
And that was a marvellous ball going away that too from the			
left handed batsman that is coming into a right handed batsman 			
And Joe Grace a left hand middle order batsman the vice captain of			
the team the right arm fast medium bowler has been utilising the 			
weather today 			
The bright sunshine has got a little bit of air we can see the			
swerves in the flag and the flags waving 			
Joe Grace coming in once more 			
Aarti Vaidya 			
And that's Olivia who returned the ball			
And before that we already have runs added to the 			
Indian total			
Three more runs added and valuable three runs 			
And of course this wicket as Mister Salvador told you uh			
is a good wicket 			
 Bahut acchi 			
Joe Grace from the hospital end 			
And she has been able to really beat the batsman once more			
Aarti Vaidya playing early the ball coming in a little late 			
And being wrapped up in the pad 			
And Aarti the left handed batsman the opening batsman of the			
Indian team score has been quite successful scoring twenty-nine runs in			
the first one day international is now facing Joe Grace 			
So that was the over of Joe Grace 			
And in this over she gave away only two runs 			
Quite commendable bowling and of course always disturbing the			
batsman 			
She has been able to extract and get swing the ball			
keeping a little low of course and that is one reason why the batsman			
possibly are not being able to go for runs in this early part of the			
innings 			
Rose Collins to resume			
One slip 			
 We'll show you the field placing 			
This is Rose Collins getting ready just seen beside the captain			
 That's how her runner is a right arm bowler 			
 In Hindi 			
So that was before Julian Langle returned it 			
Runs added to the Indian total and total moves on to eight			
for no loss 			
Eight for no loss 			
Rose Collins about to bowl 			
The ball again came in to the left handed batsman			
And we see the ball swirving out 			
Going out through a right handed batsman at one slip 			
This is a left hander Aarti Vaidya though the ball is 			
moving away from her 			
And the first odd right in on the wrapped up on the leg			
 and there is an appeal from Rose Collins 			
Turned early the ball came in late 			
And Aarti Vaidya caught there a little outside the			
wicket according to the judgement of the umpire 			
And there she is just about to resume 			
But she has to really be careful			
She has not been meeting the ball quite well this morning 			
And right on the stump once more but very careful this time is			
Aarti Vaidya 			
Taking her legs no gap between the bat and the pad and			
she is playing with that one slip you can just see in fact there are no other			
closer seen but of course there is a double gully wide apart

 K P Singh Deo Chairpersons of the different jury different			
Phalke award winners award winners of this year excellencies 			
distinguished film personalities representative of the film industry the			
media ladies and gentleman 			
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this evening function			
To honour the artists and technicians who have con			
 contributed to cinematic excellence during the			
course of the year 			
Indian cinema has today carved out a place for itself in			
popular imagination and convincingly left behind all other forms of			
entertainment 			
The credit for this goes to those innumerable artists who			
constantly endeavour to attain success of perfection while adhering to			
the Indian spirit 			
Over the years as a number of films produced has gone up 			
so has the number of national awards confer 			
Three awards for feature films were given in the year nineteen			
fifty-four 			
Today one hundred sixteen persons involved in fifty-one			
films will receive awards 			
We do need to review regulations for these awards and make			
further improvement to effectively encourage the best in Indian			
cinema

 In Hindi 			
Good evening 			
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr K P Singh			
Deo the Secretary Information and Broadcasting Ministry Mr Bhaskar			
Ghosh Dadamuni Bhupenda Jairaj Saab Chairman of jury and			
distinguished guest 			
Perhaps it would be churlish to say that the entries received 			
for the best popular cinema and this film criticism where by large			
 mediocre and substandard 			
On a more positive note let me state that it was an interesting			
exercise 			
To plough through the entries and separate the wheat from the			
chaff 			
A handfull of the books and articles indicate us that there is			
hope yet for analytical and insightful writing 			
The award wining book Nalu Nenu by the			
veteran actress Dr Bhanumati Ramakrishna underscores the point that we			
need more candid and informative autobiographies from film personalities			
I need to hardly remind you that biographical accounts 			
written in West have been important adjuncts to the process of film			
making 			
For instance many of us have cherished the life stories 			
authored by the greats of cinema ranging from memorable biography of			
Charlie Chaplin To the flashback on the life and career			
 by Vanessa Redgrave 			
Curiously very few of our own film luminaries have opted to put pen			
to paper 			
It would indeed be wonderful if directors technicians and			
the acting fraternity recounted stories of their tryst with the art and			
craft of film making 			
At this point I must regret the tendency of most Indian publishers			
to capitalise on the deaths of film personality 			
Whether it was the legendary Meena Kumari or the grand showman 			
Raj Kapoor scant attention was paid to the artistry during their own			
lifetime 			
In addition a note of caution has to be struck 			
The year nineteen ninety-five will be celebrated as the			
centenary of cinema the world over 			
If the event becomes an excuse for sketchy and quickly			
assembled books on cinema it would indeed be a pity 			
Both research and reflection are essential before any major			
endeavour in film writing is undertaken 			
To come now to film criticism on the whole the entries in this			
section displays a thorough lack of humour 			
Most of the reviews and the report submitted were weighed down			
 by excessive verbiage 			
Without adding anymore verbiage of my own let me conclude with			
a small request to the authorities from me and my colleagues on the			
panel Miss Vasudev and Miss Uday Tara Nair could the cash prize in			
the categories of the best book on cinema and best film criticism be			
increased from the current amount of rupees fifteen thousand			
each 			
Dare we say to rupees twenty-five thousand each			
That would be an extra incentive 			
Here is ending then on the note of optimism 			
Thank you 			
Thank you very much Khalid for presenting your comments 			
I now like to invite the Chairman of the non- feature film jury			
 Shri K Vikram Singh to present his address 			
Good evening 			
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting 			
Shri Singh Deo Secretary Information Broad 			
 Broadcasting Shri Bhaskar Ghosh fellow			
film makers ladies and gentleman 			
It has been a great pleasure for me and other members of the non-			
feature film jury to see and select films for the non-feature film			
awards 			
I am happy with report that the documentary film in India is			
in a state of good health 			
And the short drama film is also picking up 			
This is despite the fact that the number of entries in the			
non-feature category has declined from one fifty nineteen eighty-five 			
to only sixty-eight this year 			
This decline I think is mainly on account of the fact 			
that is lot of non-fiction work has shifted from the film format to			
the video format 			
This body of work on video format is still going largely			
unrecognised 			
This jury has therefore separately recommended that			
documentaries and short films on the video format should be brought			
within the fold of the national awards 			
How that can be done is left to an expert committee 			
But there is one field of documentary film which is facing			
imminent death 			
This is the yarn of political documentary 			
There were very few political documentaries in this years			
entry 			
It is not as if the film makers have lost interest in this one			
word 			
Perhaps the real reason is that the culture of respecting			
dissent is fast disappearing from our social political life 			
And therefore the social funding political films have died			
out 			
If different and even clashing views are not battled and			
sorted out on the floors of legislative body and in the media they			
are bound to violently overflow on the streets 			
There is an urgent need therefore for creating a framework 			
on our statefunded television that is doordarshan 			
within which voices of dissent can be responsibly expressed 			
I would urge the government as a research step 			
doordarshan should air off a weakly slot which may be called the			
other vaults the other views			
In this research oriented documentaries of the political nature			
 should be shown 			
These should be funded by doordarshan but the			
overall thing is monitoring of this slot should be vested in a			
non-political body of indepen of independent			
 intellectual 			
National film awards are a celebration of cinema as an art form			
A beginning was made several years ago to name an award 			
after Dada Saheb Phalke and another award after Nargis Dutt 			
It is time we took another step in this direction 			
I suggest that the government should name the awards for the			
best film on social issues in the non-feature category after S 			
Suth Ray who still remain inadequately recognised 			
I would also suggest that the government should name the best			
feature films award after Satyajit Ray who is without question the			
greatest film writer and one of the finest mind that India has			
produced in this century 			
 In Hindi 			
Thanks we begin the presentation of award we would like to			
request Dr Bhupen Hazarika to give the awards 			
And so long to the first award of the evening

Welcome to you from Chandigarh 			
This is Anu Prashantiya reporting to you from 			
Doordarshan Jallandhar 			
 We're bringing to you now the National Lawn Tennis			
Championship nineteen ninety-four 			
The finals which are just about to be played on the Chandigarh			
lawns here this morning 			
We have there the Governor Lieutenant General Shibir sitting			
there in the grey suit awaiting the players coming on to the court			
Seated next to him in the black blazer is Mr Vinod Duggal			
 chief advisor to the administrator of Chandigarh 			
We have the students the tennis players the ball boys			
There we have the Governor going out to the court now for the			
inauguration of the final accompanied by Mr Rajan Kashyap 			
the president of the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association 			
We have the Governor now introducing himself to the players 			
Their is Asif Ismail and Mahesh Bhupathy			
And now we have him introducing to the staff and the other			
members 			
He is being introduced by Mr Maria Secretary 			
I have to introduce Mr Rajan Kashyap and the Governor 			
who are now in the process of being introduced to the players of			
Chandigarh 			
I think Chandigarh has it's rare honour today of			
having the National once again after almost fifteen years 			
Last national not fifteen years it's about eleven			
years 			
The last national played was here in nineteen eighty-three in			
which we had Vasudevan winning the mens' title and I			
won the womens' title here in nineteen eighty-three 			
So it's a great day for me to be here after			
winning the last national being played in Chandigarh to come here and			
commentate today on this mens' and the womens' singles			
The court these are the ball boys the ball girls 			
having a talk with the Governor 			
They are the trainees of C L T A as I've been corrected by			
my fellow commentator 			
I have to introduce Mr Mayan Kapoor who's also an			
Asian former Tennis champion junior champion whom I have with me			
doing the Hindi commentary 			
And that's the Governor going back after meeting 			
all the players the students the ball boys and there we have			
the applause by everyone 			
Green grass awaits the match though nationals is now			
 come of an age where we don't have very huge crowds watching			
the nationals probably because we don't have the A T T points and we do			
not 			
The boys here are the students who are the who've			
 come to watch the match 			
The huge stadium in Sector ten in Chandigarh 			
The students seem to be very keen on this sunny morning 			
I think probably the school has given them the day off to come and			
watch the match 			
There the hills behind			
I think Chandigarh by and large is a beautiful city 			
Beautiful city with lovely weather 			
And soon they have started and they've taken lawn			
tennis in a very big way as they made several grasscourts at the			
Chandigarh Club 			
And now we have the players stepping on to the court 			
Mahesh Bhupathy yesterday defeated Nitin Kar			
 Kirtane 			
He was extended and he had won the match in three sets 			
And Asif Ismail beat K G Ramesh in straight sets 			
Asif Ismail seems to be in a fitter condition because he just			
played in the Davis Cup Match and showed great promise in Jaipur 			
But he gave away under pressure 			
At the last minute he showed a lot of talent but he could			
not carry it on till the end 			
Let us see how he fares in the match today 			
The players are now warming up and uh that Asif Ismail 			
 that's Mahesh Bhupaty now 			
Mahesh Bhupathy on your screen now interruption much			
thinner than interruption 			
Players are now getting ready for the match 			
We have uh from the commentators box we have Asif Ismail uh			
 Asif Ismail serving to Mahesh Bhupathy 			
First serve 			
Uhm just missed the line 			
Oh that was an easy shot but missed by Bhupathy 			
Serving down the middle and the backhand uh of uh			
Bhupathy and Bhupathy I think got the ball right in his stomach 			
Fifteen love 			
Again score now is thirty love 			
First game first serve applaud 			
A lovely shot 			
Asif ne abhi drop volley try ki lekin			
 drop volley was a little too far back and it was very easy for			
Bhupathy to reach the ball 			
There we have the action replay 			
You can see the crosscourt it just touched the net cord 			
beautiful shot there by Bhupathy 			
Thirty fifteen 			
Oh there was foul there 			
Let them I think both are uh at the moment in the			
beginning not very well warmed up and from thirty love up 			
Asif is thirty O 			
First first service 			
Not a double four there by Asif I think he should so early in			
the game he has had first game only two double fours 			
That was a great point for Bhupathy however 			
Service was a little too good for him 			
Asif is not serving that well yet 			
 He's capable of much better service 			
Much much slower he's serving today that's 			
deuce 			
That was a well played point 			
After sent it went right upto th net that's what he			
should be doing after his service 			
 Haan service 			
And that's advantage point foul for service 			
I think abhi tak koi accha point one has			
not seen except one crosscourt forehand that's the replay			
 In Hindi he's not showing 			
Advantage again to Asif 			
There he's taken the first game Asif by a good			
 service down the line from the backhand court 			
And that's one love Asif Ismail's first			
game 			
Inspite of three double faults Asif has been able to foiled this			
game that shows that uh Bhupathy has not really fought into			
this game 			
And uh we are finding Asif looking back because what's			
 not on the screen is that the Governor is leaving 			
And we have the replay of the point 			
Service which is down the line and Asif is still watching			
 the Governor and everyone leaving 			
Now we have the second game of the match 			
 We're going to watch Bhupathy serving to Asif Ismail			
I was just having a talk with the administrator of Chandigarh			
 the advisor to the administrator and I was given to be 			
 given to understand that C L T A the tennis complex is			
located in about three hundred acre green park 			
And there we have uh Bhupathy serving his first serve 			
foul that's right 			
Oh Asif is trying for that four hand down the line			
But I guess he was standing up too straight for that shot 			
He needed to bend down because the net is usually a little bit			
higher on the sides 			
One needs to get down lower on ones' knees 			
 That's fifteen love to Bhupathy 			
Fourth first service 			
 That's a good variation in service from Bhupathy a			
kind of a spin but however well vanished by Asif Ismail 			
We have that lovely passing shot 			
Makes it fifteen all two three 			
We don't find much of excitement			
Nobody is out there to try to break service 			
Thirty fifteen fourth first service 			
That was a service return a bit too higher by Asif Ismail			
making it very easy for Bhupathy to put that volley away 			
 It's very important in these points in return of service			
to keep the ball low 			
And that game point came to Bhupathy an easy service game			
there at forty fifteen 			
Which makes it three games all first set 			
We find the usual crowd is also very quite 			
Players are also lacking the enthusiasm 			
I think this game has uh still to heat up 			
Oh 			
What ?			
Fifteen love 			
 There's that replay of the shot 			
 There's a just a little bit out I thought and			
 there's a disagreement on that point 			
The linesman is just sitting quietly and that's 			
Bhupathy arguing that that ball was right but I think there's not			
true really 			
Simply it's a long argument there 			
Fifteen love 			
Oh ho that was a nice return there 			
I think uh Asif Ismail a little too early there that he play			
 is that put away very decisively but too close was			
Bhupathy and he got that return 			
Fifteen O 			
Got first service cough 			
Oh that was a lovely put away there 			
Besides his forehand crosscourt volley by Asif Ismail 			
 There's that top spin service an easy volley 			
because the ball was so high 			
I think the boys have to look forward to making their return of			
service much better 			
Thirty fifteen Asif 			
First first service 			
 It's a very good shot return 			
Wonderful passing shot there by Asif Ismail that was I think			
the longest rally in the match today 			
 There's that action replay he had to run back to get			
 that log and there he's extended to the other end of the			
court and here we see the final passing shot the beautiful backhand			
down drive by Asif Ismail 			
So Asif serving forty fifteen on his service first first			
service 			
Oh ho there quick return there by Bhupathy taking Asif			
 into an unforge terrain 			
 There's the replay again 			
 He's rushing into the court and he's just caught			
on unaware this hits in the middle of the body line shot 			
Still in its point to go for the game for Asif Ismail 			
All first service 			
Beautiful shot return there by Bhupathy a wonderful			
forehand down the line passing shot on Asif service which makes it			
deuce now for the players 			
A chance there that wonderful shot once again you can see			
how well he converted his back hand and he went quickly before 			
Asif could reach the leg 			
 It's deuce 			
Oh ho that was lucky that was really lucky high backhand			
volley there's that service and that's the high 			
backhand volley just touch the tip of the net and dropped off there 			
 Let's call a lucky shot at the right time 			
Advantage Asif Ismail 			
Oh he didn't really concentrate on that one it was not			
that difficult a shot 			
That was a lovely service a very good backhand volley			
crosscourt returned by Mahesh Bhupathy 			
And watch that service on the corner and he's right up at			
the net that's the game 			
Oh beautiful shot there by Asif Ismail a wonderful			
backhand crosscourt return 			
 He's right up at the ball 			
There is look at that stretching backhand volley and			
that 			
At the one word 			
Fifteen			
Fifteen thirty 			
 Bhupathy's service 			
Uh just missed that was a lovely try by Asif Ismail going			
out for one of his big backhand crosscourt return to service but he			
just missed the line and that gives a chance to Bhupathy to			
equalise the points at thirty all 			
First first service 			
Oh lovely offensive lot there a beautiful shot touch of			
mastery there by Asif Ismail 			
That was a there's the replay and you could see			
the stretched backhand volley return and that's 			
the defensive lot 			
 That's the break point for Asif Asif Ismail			
The first break point in the match 			
Oh a double fall there gives Asif Ismail the much needed			
break at the right time coming also which gives him a five three			
lead 			
 That's Asif Ismail forty love the second game of			
second set 			
Oops that was a unforge terror there 			
Lucky shot 			
But he's got a good lead there that's the			
shot we're showing you again on screen and he's trying			
to drop volley but unsuccessful 			
The boys are running there on the court so Asif chooses			
not to start his service 			
These students have to be asked to sit down 			
The screen is not showing it but the players are being			
disturbed because the children are moving at stadium 			
To come back on court childern have now by and large			
settled down 			
 That's how Asif regaining forty fifteen up 			
and love one for his second set 			
Oops try to block that volley Asif Ismail but I think he			
did not put his racket down just let flat straight out 			
Still in the lead Asif Ismail serving forty thirty 			
All first service 			
Beautiful crosscourt backhand by Mahesh Bhupathy at			
the right time also 			
 There's that wonderful crosscourt backhand 			
return of service which makes a deuce 			
All first service I think us break 			
ke baad he's lost his concentration 			
Second service double faults so forty love there's			
 an advantage now 			
I think this uh taking this game too easy is could			
provide to be very risky for Asif Ismail 			
 There's a break point now for the second time 			
 That's it there is the break 			
There is the break which needed which Bhupathy was looking for			
 Mahesh up two love 			
Forty love he was leading and there there he lost his			
concentration 			
First first service 			
 It's a very weak return of service there 			
Fifteen love second service 			
Just a minute just about			
Asif Ismail is hardly showing any the serve in the game			
 In Hindi 			
At the wrong time in Hindi if continues to do this			
any further he's already one game down his service is lost 			
He can't afford to take it uh easy 			
Beautiful service there 			
Oh lovely passing shot there down the line by Asif Ismail			
that shows he's a man capable of class 			
Thirty fifteen 			
A good service there in backhand pass corner of Asif			
Ismail 			
And Bhupathy is with the safe lead over in third game 			
The move is set it's going to be difficult for Asif			
Ismail now 			
Next second service 			
Oop facing the sun Bhupathy trying to give a smash 			
there was a miss hit there 			
Bhupathy still in the lead with forty thirty on his service			
A decisive volley there gives him three love leads 			
I think this uh set is going to be little difficult might 			
 there's the return of service you can see this defensive			
backhand crosscourt volley Bhupathy showed a lot of consistency in			
this game which which a player even tries to bring up his game 			
at a certain depth 			
But now he should so that's love five Asif			
Ismail serving 			
A beautiful service down the forehand corner by Asif			
Ismail 			
Down the line winner there making it fifteen all 			
His service lacked depth which is very easy to go for			
the down line 			
Thirty all no fifteen all there and I think the			
students are moving again and disturbing Asif Ismail 			
Good service but I don't find Bhupathy at all stretching 			
himself 			
This was an easy ball he could have stretched himself and			
tried for a winner 			
 He's standing there not even trying to move his left			
leg to move movements are so slow that's an out 			
Thirty all 			
 It's a great privilege for me to be commentating			
on the women tennis because uh of the past experience for			
nineteen eighty nineteen years lawn tennis 			
I was just before the match speaking with uh Nirupama that			
on the screen you see Janaki 			
And uh Janaki is from Bombay and she is uh Janaki is			
from Bombay and she is uh looking fit at the moment 			
She has lost uh this is a wrong caption I think we are showing			
That about I was pointing out 			
Uh this is			
This is Nirupama that's Nirupama and she is 			
seventeen years now 			
So I was just telling you telling the viewers that just before I			
entered the uh commentators box I was talking to Nirupama and I was			
talking to her father 			
In fact we have her father here with us in the commentary box 			
And they both were telling me that uh Nirupama was when			
she was about fourteen this girl was already uh uh number one in			
India			
She had won the national uh championship hard court and she has			
shown great promise 			
But again from the age of fourteen one never found her being picked			
up and groomed much earlier and she also suffers from the same			
problem			
She says now I'm already seventeen and 			
it's so late 			
And uh why didn't she go into big game and big tennis at			
the age of thirteen or fourteen ?			
The same answer that lack of finances lack of support and uh			
 for women tennis I don't think India is a right place at all 			
 We've it's it's continuing for years on end 			
I remember the same thing used to happen uptil nineteen			
eighty-one until nineteen eighty-two till I played tennis and the			
same thing is continuing in ninety-four			
Where have we come ten years from now 			
 I'd like to uh uh interview her father in fact 			
Why don't you come and share your views with us ?			
 We'll do that a bit later because we have the first			
game in progress 			
And that's Nirupama serving the first serve 			
applause 			
Beautiful crosscourt returned by Janaki 			
Love fifteen 			
You see Janaki Nirupama serving now to Janaki 			
 That's a beautiful forehand down the line returned			
 applaud 			
And that's love thirty to Nirupama on her service 			
Keeping the ball in play Nirupama claiming fifteen thirty 			
for the first set 			
Next shot there a beautiful return by Janaki cross again			
Put away forehand crosscourt volley 			
 That's the recaption again 			
A very good pick up there by Nirupama makes it 			
fifteen forty 			
 That's a drop shot there by Janaki 			
Nirupama did not even try for this ball I think it is far too long			
for her to run 			
In uh leading tennis unfortunately service has never played			
such a major role 			
And there we have first break 			
Whereas in men's tennis it acquires much greater			
significance probably because the boys follow up their service to the			
net and the women even after serving tend to stick it on in the base line			
And that makes the service as good as any other ball 			
It looses it's significance altogether 			
When we have big service in the world like Martina Navratilova and			
 Beligin king and they used to follow up their balls to the net			
And once they did that it made their service and it made their			
ball and made the volley much more effective 			
For it one has to stay around at the base line then service really			
 does not have that much of significance 			
We have the first break of Nirupama and Janaki up one love in			
the first set 			
We hope that the women's tennis is not such a wash out			
as it was in the men's cough 			
Love fifteen 			
Nirupama has beaten Janaki earlier when they met this year 			
that's what she told me 			
The ball seems to be much faster on grass for Janaki cough			
Janaki serving love thirty 			
Oh Janaki is uh relying on this rough shot 			
But I don't find Nirupama making any effort to come forward 			
This tactics of Janaki is going to pay off untill unless			
Nirupama tries to come up to the net 			
Beautiful shot there by Janaki a beautiful forehand crosscourt			
taking a round of the court 			
Equalising the score at thirty all 			
First of service 			
Forty thirty cough 			
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama taking on the offensive for			
the first time and hitting that ball crosscourt forehand 			
There is that replay a slight backhand return by Janaki and			
that the put away crosscourt 			
Deuce first first service interruption 			
Uh Nirupama trying to make a winner out of it second			
return second service however she missed the points she went			
in the prickly part where the ball didn't got 			
 That's deuce once again first first service 			
Return of service good return of service by Nirupama 			
cough 			
I think that Nirupama really threw away that point she			
had a break point from Janaki's service 			
 It's not going to be a very easy match for her if she			
throws away such easy points 			
Good backhand 			
Oh Janaki just could not keep up the consistency and			
hit the ball double fisted backhand out 			
Advantage once again to Nirupama to take a break back into			
the first set 			
Second service Janaki serving advantage to Nirupama safe			
backhand return 			
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama who's taken on the			
offensive hitting on both the flags very beautifully and has broken			
that service of Janaki making it one game all 			
And there's the replay of that shot that wonderful			
forehand crosscourt winners and no way could Janaki ever reach that ball			
One game all first set 			
Very good return of service there by Janaki meeting the ball			
early and using the timing of the service 			
 There's that 			
Quick return of service there by Janaki and that's 			
the return of Nirupama through down cough 			
Yes Janaki slices the ball far too often 			
 That's a nice shot there by Janaki making it 			
thirty all 			
He took she took the ball on the line that's the			
replay and you see her totally bent in total position going in for			
that tidal line forehand winner 			
Oh that was just total bad luck she tried to hit forehand			
crosscourt 			
I think she needed to bend a little more 			
Nirupama serving forty thirty 			
Foul out 			
 That's deuce once again 			
Nirupama needs to get back into the game with more consistency now			
Beautiful shot there by Janaki brought the low ball low			
ball returned beautifully by Janaki there 			
See how low the ball is keeping see and she is able to 			
hit that winner 			
Uhm good service there by Nirupama stretching around the			
backhand corner 			
And justifies only low return 			
Deuce once again 			
Foul first service advantage Janaki 			
Third person 			
Wonderful top spin backhand return by Janaki forcing 			
Nirupama to deuce once again 			
Now a drop shot there by Nirupama 			
I don't think she really wanted to hit that shot it was 			
stroke of luck that fell so short 			
In grasscourt say if it is a drop shot it gets uh difficult to			
handle it cough 			
That game to Nirupama leading two one in the first set 			
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor 			
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor 			
She is coming out with the shots which in the			
beginning she wasn't 			
She is getting to the winner she's getting the rhythm now			
 and is able to reach the ball faster and even the timing of			
the ball is much more accurate with her now 			
And uh 			
Beautiful 			
That was a beautiful shot there by Janaki Krishnamurthy			
What all can see here is the low rally which they had 			
this kind of of best long rally uh in the match here there you can			
see the crosscourt backhand return and once again a crosscourt			
return by Nirupama and down the line winner 			
All are just 			
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama 			
Beautiful shot out of the blue 			
You could see Nirupama doing a little variation in that game 			
She started tossing the ball a little higher 			
You could see that toss now 			
 That's the winner across she sprung out of the blue			
Fifteen all 			
Oh that's Nirupama's mistake there 			
She needs to steady down a little more 			
Fifteen thirty uh thirty fifteen 			
 That's Janaki a few words which is not			
called for at the moment at all 			
 That's the beautiful slice uh combat between the two			
 girls a shot slight backhand combat with two words it went			
on and on until the Janaki gave up 			
 That's a break point for Nirupama and a set point			
also of the first set 			
 That's it the set goes to Nirupama at six two 			
 In Hindi 			
 In Hindi she played very well 			
See what Nirupama was rightly telling me is that uh she			
has showed potential much earlier 			
But she says that uh nobody did anything for me 			
and I had no financer 			
In fact I told her you're from Tamil Nadu and Tamil			
Nadu does a lot			
But she said no I have not got anything from any			
support from any quarter 			
The women's tennis also needs to be picked up you see			
Beautiful but missed shot there by Janaki first 			
Thirty love to Nirupama 			
Lovely shot again 			
Nirupama is really showing a lot of confidence in her strokes 			
Just shaping up well playing well and she still has uh 			
good future ahead of her 			
 In Hindi 			
 In HIndi and then uh Nirupama also needs to go			
up on the net much more than she has taken her position 			
Oh that ball was called out so forty fifteen to Nirupama			
Janaki is not showing any signs of coming back 			
In the beginning game of the second set 			
Oh ho beautiful shot there by Janaki			
I think that she's really gone out of the way with			
the slight backhand and forehand crosscourt return there 			
 That's the replay and that's the crosscourt			
shot that Janaki gave up 			
 It's beautiful crosscourt winner 			
Forty thirty to Nirupama 			
Easy return beautiful shot there easy sitter there			
sitting there for Nirupama to put on net 			
You know there is one thing I wanted to share with you Mahin 			
 haan and also for the benefit of our viewers			
 that ours uh that see uh replay which we've been			
watching then I'll share it with you there is that put away shot			
which gives her a game 			
You know in our country it's very difficult for women			
to come forward at this level 			
See for men it's much easier 			
Our country it is very traditional and a women has to perform			
many roles 			
She has to also be a housewife 			
She also has to be a daughter at home she also has to do her			
studies 			
And if they come forward and perform like this in matches 			
then they should be encouraged because they have a triple role if they			
become a sportswomen 			
They have because in India sports alone is not enough they ask			
you what else are you ?			
What are you in your studies ?			
And are you an M B A ?			
Or are you a Ph D ?			
 It's very important in our country to be a Ph D's			
 also 			
And plus a woman is never only a Ph D and a sportswoman 			
she also has to look after her home she has to have babies 			
So therefore you know for a woman life is much more tougher			
 and if she comes out of her shell and becomes a sportswoman I think			
she needs all the applause and the encouragement which she deserves 			
 Haan 			
 In Hindi 			
But this Nirupama is showing promise but in Hindi			
 then the age is over applaud 			
Fifteen all Nirupama was saying she's uh 			
attending an academy abroad she's training there 			
Just imagine the the expense and who is paying for it 			
Now if the family is uske peeche 			
it's okay otherwise there's nobody 			
Her mother is uh with her in the academy 			
Uh Nirupama			
Nirupama 			
I remember for seventeen eighteen years my mother travelled			
with me otherwise who is there to be with us 			
She travelled all over the country with me 			
Beautiful shot there by Janaki 			
Janaki can sometimes pull up some beautiful ground strokes			
 In Hindi 			
She just needs a little more experience 			
Over first service 			
Uh but she is able to do that well did service and that			
one game all in the second set 			
But she returns the service is not very effective 			
What I wanted to look at was all communication between			
different workers in industries at different levels in various			
organisations 			
Uh and I was looking at			
I wanted to look at in fact I was interested in looking at both			
 the reported use of in uh English in industries and 			
uh the actual use of uh English in industries 			
Uh because I thought there would be a difference 			
What you imagine you use is not always what you actually use			
Uh you imagine you use a particular language but when you			
 uh when you are observed you find that there is or you			
observe yourself you find that you are in fact not actually using			
what you thought or what you imagined you use uh in different contexts			
with different people for different purposes 			
So I thought I would study both the aspects and compare the two 			
Unfortunately for me I was not allowed to record anything at			
all in industries because for uh they felt that for security			
reasons they could not allow tape recorders on to 			
campus			
Now this is one of the disadvantages this is one of the			
constraints under which I was working 			
So I thought well I confine myself to reported use only 			
And how did I go about this uhm well I thought I would			
select industries in Andhra Pradesh that is uh for no other reason			
except that I work there and I thought it would be easy for me to have			
access to various industries in Andhra Pradesh 			
Now how was I to decide which industries I should take up for			
 my study 			
Uh it would be difficult to decide and it was difficult to decide			
initially 			
Then I thought I would look at uh a comparatively uh			
industrially advanced area industrially advanced area and a sta			
 uh uh uh a district that was industrially backward so that I would			
have the two extremes uh uh for my study 			
Uh ju for that reason I said okay			
Hyderabad is industrially more advanced and Karnool district is			
industrially backward 			
So I took up these two districts the industries in these			
two districts for my study cough 			
Now what kind of study was I going to get a			
representative industrial population from that again was very difficult			
for me to decide 			
Uh finally I did some reading I uh did a bit of study 			
I tried to find out get information about the kind of industries			
one could have			
And I broadly classified these industries and there there			
is a classification available uh in the literature uh into public			
sector undertaking and private sector undertaking undertaking 			
that was the main classification 			
And then the other factor that I thought might affect 			
the use of language uh was location of industry 			
And this was very convenient for me to do because Karnool			
district being backward had a large number of rural industries 			
Now let me explain what I mean by rural 			
 I by rural I don't mean a completely rural area 			
because that would be contradictory in terms			
You can't have an industry where you don't have the			
infrastructure for for an industry 			
So let us say by rural I meant very small towns or 			
uhm probably you would understand Taluk better at			
the subdivision levels 			
So uh I classified my industries and I selected			
industries from Hyderabad public and private			
And then Hyderabad provided me with the urban sector and			
 uhm Karnool with rural industries 			
Then I decided on how I was going to collect this data 			
And uh since I had to I was almost compelled to 			
look at only reported use I had to think about how I was going to go			
about uh collecting data for reported use of English 			
Uh when I say English uh please don't imagine that I forgot			
about the Indian languages 			
I always looked at the use of English vis a vis			
 the Indian languages that the employees there uh in these			
industries were using 			
Now as far as methodology is concerned I thought I would go			
about it by first of all observing what went on in these			
industries 			
So general uh observation and I followed this up by a			
questionnaire and I refined my questionnaire as I went along on the			
basis of the observation cough 			
After my informants filled in the questionnaire I went about			
interviewing some of them			
I couldn't have interviewed uh all the informants because I			
had nearly four hundred informants 			
But I uh took a fairly large population and uh and			
therefore I was able to uhm interview quite a large number of			
informants 			
Uh having collected the questionnaire I would look at their			
responses and then base my interviews on the basis of those uh uh 			
of their answers to my questions 			
One to check whether they were aware of what they had 			
answered they were aware of the reasons for their answers 			
Also to check whether they had in fact read the			
questionnaire carefully and uh had answered these correctly			
Some of them in fact it turned out that some of them in fact			
were not aware of what they have done			
They had just put ticks and 			
crosses uh for the sake of completing the			
questionnaire 			
So I had to do that to cross check to make sure that they did			
fill in the questionnaires 			
When uh I uh analysed this I'm I am saying all			
this very briefly because I wouldn't like to go into detail 			
I analysed uh these questionnaires the uh all that			
I have collected and also uh recorded my observations of			
their behaviour 			
And I tried to look at the association or the relationship			
 between the use their use of English with their			
 superiors equals and their juniors and relation 			
to the social variables 			
That is the relationship between their use of English with 			
superiors with equals and juniors and with the social variables 			
type of industry that is either public or private location of			
industry that is urban and rural 			
Occupation and for occupation I had the uh higher			
level middle level and lower level of occupation 			
Education again I had the higher level middle level and			
low level of education 			
Medium of instruction in school 			
And I had I I I chose medium of instruction in school			
because that is where the the main differences is some people have			
English and some people have a regional languages or Indian languages 			
And exposure to English that is whether they in fact 			
were exposed to a lot of English as far as their reading was concerned			
 magazines journals			
Now this would also be uh I I predicted that this would be uh			
related to their jobs as well 			
Depending on what their job was they would probably read the			
kind of literature that they needed for their jobs as well 			
Now in addition to this I also looked at their attitudes 			
And I must admit I found it very difficult to assess their			
attitudes 			
I did get some uh uh a rough idea of what there attitudes were			
Uh and I ag again related these			
attitudes their attitudes to English to the the variables that I had			
taken up earlier type and location of industries occupation education			
 medium of instruction exposure to English 			
Uh now cough from my analysis of the			
questionnaire and on the basis of my observation of their behaviour 			
on the basis of my interviews uh these were the uh the			
conclusions I drew 			
The most general general conclusion that I drew was that			
 these people who are professionals who work in these			
industries had a very functional professional attitude to			
the use of English 			
They don't have a political bias at all 			
They are not bothered about whether the language ought to be			
taught or introduced at school or college or not except 			
when a except uh uh they would be bothered of course ex only			
when they were uh they considered the utility of that language for			
their profession 			
They felt that they needed English for certain			
purposes 			
They needed English to talk to uh their superiors for			
instance 			
Now looking at the variables I found that the			
location of industry was a very very important variable as far			
as the uh use of English was concerned 			
It was a very important variable which affected the use of			
English 			
Employees in rural industries for example specially those 			
who had to deal with handloom for instance who had to deal with			
spinning and weaving and who use only indigenous uh technology 			
did not need the use of English as much as did those who used foreign			
technology 			
And in fact their view on this was that they 			
as long as they were uh they were not as advanced as the			
western countries and uh one of them used the word begging-bowl 			
They had to use this begging-bowl for technology and knowledge			
They would be compelled to use those languages 			
that helped them to have access to science and technology to all			
knowledge that would help them to uh adva uh to uh to be			
industrially advanced that was their view about the use of English			
Now the other the the the other variable that I found was			
very important was interlocutors that is those uh they the use of			
English depended on whether an employee was conversing with his			
superior equal or junior 			
And more English naturally was used while conversing with superiors			
Another variable that was important was occupation			
This was another important variable that affected the use of 			
language and that also included the nature of their job 			
Those who were highly technically qualified naturally needed to			
talk about technical matters more than those who were dealing for			
instance with administration who were not directly concerned with			
production 			
Those who were directly concerned with production used much			
more English and felt they needed much more English because their job			
required them to use more English than those who dealt with administrative			
matters there were for instance the personnel branch where			
they had to deal even with the with uh with all those workers from			
the shop-floor for whom they had to provide say even things like uniforms			
and shoes 			
Now they did not need English to converse with 			
those uh with with workers from the shop-floor and doors			
So they needed to use English much less than those who were 			
technically highly technically qualified and uh were required to			
discuss technical matters 			
Uh the another another factor that affected English a			
great deal the use of English a great deal was context 			
This was a very important uh factor which affected the use			
of English 			
Uh formerly for instance when they were at a meeting and			
I sat in them some of their meetings 			
When they were uhm talking to customers from outside 			
when they were at the office doing their daily work and transactions 			
they tended to use much more English than they did when they were			
say at a social get together 			
I attended some of their social get togethers and I found 			
that their get togethers were much more relaxed much more informal 			
and therefore there was less and less use of English more and more 			
use of Indian languages 			
Uh uh I am afraid I coudn't quantify the exact uh uh use of			
English and versus the Indian languages but I can only say that			
there was a client English at the level of formality and this as we			
went down to more and more informal levels uh became more and			
more minus English and more and more plus Indian languages 			
And also their attitudes as I said earlier their attitudes			
to uh the use of English uh were all based on the need for			
English the various functions they had to perform and they felt 			
that if a language helps them to do the job well well that was the			
language they were going to use they were not bothered about whether it had a			
prestige value or not 			
For them it was uh and some of them in fact said 			
sometimes it was an Indian language that uh works as a lubricant they			
call it a lubricant if they wanted to uh get a job done they			
would suddenly switch over to their uh to their mother tongue			
 or to the local language 			
They they didn't bother about whether it was their mother tongue			
 certainly not which ever language they thought they could 			
 effect effectively communicate in was			
used between them 			
And of course most of them felt that English was very			
essential for science and technology 			
Now this is very interesting			
It was very essential for an individual's job			
opportunities and success at work 			
It was very essential for interstate communication 			
It was not at all essential for English at home for			
for communication at home 			
Uh about English for education it is interesting to note that			
 they had uh different views some of them felt that 			
we should have English all the way so that all the sections of the			
people would get uh fair opportunity to learn the language 			
And therefore go up the social scale and also uh uh get			
more opportunities for work and for jobs 			
Uh some of them felt that there was no need to learn English at uh			
uh upto primary school at the primary level because we should be we			
should give our children more opportunities to learn our own 			
languages Indian languages 			
Some of them felt that English should be introduced only			
 uh after middle school 			
They they felt that there was no need to do to introduce			
English and after middle school too it should be taught only as a			
subject upto high school 			
And it was only uh they were all of course unanimous in saying			
that English should be introduced only at the college level as a medium of			
instruction 			
So these are some of the as if the the findings of the			
study I haven't gone into very great detail because that would have			
taken me the whole day almost 			
Uh these are some of the interesting findings that we uh			
that uh I came up with at uh at the end of the the the study 			
This is the beginning of novels beginnings of novel in			
India 			
Now before I take up this uh subject there is query from a			
colleague of ours from Bombay 			
She has uh she is willing to know as to where we can get			
material critical material and creative writing on Australian			
literature 			
Because Australian literature as you know is quite new 			
Uh from amongst uh uh Commonwealth literature uh lot of			
work is being done in Canadian literature			
This is main mainly because 			
I am giving you this piece of information uh because there are number			
of fellowships and scholarships available for Commonwealth uh studies			
And uh not many people are aware of these 			
Now uh literatures in Commonwealth again be divided into two			
parts one is White one is Black 			
In White we have three major literatures Australian 			
Canadian and New Zealand 			
Uh and in Black you know most of these literatures Nigerian			
South African Indian Pakistani and other literatures 			
Now there won't be many fellowships in as far as uh Asian			
countries are concerned or African countries are concerned but there are			
some in West Indians 			
And we also have a one word meeting next year in			
uh Kingston Jamaica in West Indies 			
So those of you who are interested they could send their papers it			
means there are three themes 			
 I once I remember on which I am presenting a paper is			
the theme of voyage theme of flight 			
Uh this you can take up study one novel or one novelist or one			
writer how she or he has projected this theme in his uh writing in			
poetry or fiction			
For example uh it could be a voyage in case of one Anita Desai			
 Desai from uhm outside world into inside world			
Then she talks of you know inner world 			
This is a voyage			
So voyage can be interpreted in several ways 			
Even this East West encounter is a voyage 			
So you we don't have to be scared of the theme you can			
write anything with voyage as the as the basic modem 			
This will be in West Indies next year nineteen ninety-two 			
And uhm uh all applications have to be made to at one			
word London or the professor in charge there in Jamaica in			
Kingston 			
Uh apart from that West Indies we have uh 			
fellowships in Canadian literature			
I think most of you know that at Delhi we have an institute			
known as the Shastri uh Institute Institute of Indo-Canadian Studies 			
And they give large number of fellowships uh atleast twelve			
to teachers of English			
And these fellowships they arrange in at three levels 			
One is the five week fellowship one is the three four months			
fellowship and one is nine months 			
Uh again five weeks fellowship is divided into two uh part 			
One is those who are persuing there research 			
Second thing is uh faculty in recent uh programme that			
is senior lecturers who are not to persue any research in Canadian studies			
but they would like to be acquainted with the Canadian literature or			
Canadian studies and come back and teach uh at B A and M A level or			
 as guide for M A M phil or Ph D students 			
The so these uhm five weeks scholarships are for students you			
know students in the sense scholars who are working who are researching			
 for their M Phil Ph D's and also for those you know			
there is a different caption			
And also for those one is known as uhm study programme 			
another is faculty improvement 			
And four month is again for those who want to study in a			
more comprehensive uh comprehensive fashion 			
And nine months is mainly for those who are persuing their			
research in uh Canadian literature 			
Uh terms are very lucrative both one word and uh uh uh			
very good uh amount of payment fellowships during your stay in Canada			
This is about Canada 			
Application forms are available 			
And uh then third is Australia			
Australia has not uh instituted any fellowship as yet 			
but uh they are they have a very uh uhm uhm ambitious			
programme and they have set up as Professor Pandey said the other day 			
Australian Indian Council 			
Uhm this is just being set up it'll come into			
operation next year ninety-two early ninety-two 			
And uh under this programme they will be instituting			
fellowships 			
They are going to set up a centre uh centre for Australia			
 India studies 			
Similarly Indian Society for Commonwealth studies of which			
professor Pandey is the Chairman 			
Uh our society is going to set up an Indian centre 			
centre which will be known as Indo Australian centre uh of			
studies you know 			
Indo uh sorry uh centre for Indo-Australian studies 			
well both the names are so similar 			
Their is Australian-Indian ours is Indo-Australian 			
Uh where we set up this only time will tell uh Australian			
government is very helpful and fellowships will are in			
the offing 			
Apart from that as far as the availability of books is			
concerned uh Australian government has a very liberal norm in giving			
books not to individual but to institutions 			
And there are certain Universities cough which have			
been identified as the Universities where Commonwealth literature 			
research is going on			
Poona University is one of them 			
The other Universities uh the Universities I know of which 			
one is Delhi University one word University of Anantpur			
 Poona University is third Bombay University Calcutta University Bangalore			
University Mysore University Chandigarh Punjab University uh			
these seven eight Universities then Osmania then Central University			
Hyderabad these are nine ten Universities I remember			
Out of the nineteen Universities which have been identified as			
centres uhm which can promote the study of Australian literature			
and Commonwealth literature as a whole 			
So if you need some books on Australian literature it is 			
that through uh get in touch with these uh uhm Universities 			
Poona University has just been given some seventy or eighty books			
So from time to time they receive books uh from the			
government Australian Embassy here and these books are dispatched to			
various Universities 			
So amongst Australian writers the most popular has been 			
Patrick White because he is the only writer who got Nobel Prize 			
And uh as far as Patrick White is concerned I think all			
novel most of it most of the novels by Patrick White they are			
available in India 			
A lot of fiction is also available 			
But other writers which are coming up like Rodney Hall who			
visited Delhi University as a visiting uhm fellow last year for about			
four months 			
Uh Rodney Hall and Leftmary and uh Judith one			
word lot of coach who came to India some three years ago 			
A lot of work has been done on these writers 			
I will be very happy if uh we take up research on these writers			
Uh because I should have been saying so British literature uh			
 is any way dying uh even American literature has become stale 			
So it's time we focus our attention on new literatures			
 which are coming up 			
So if you want uh books on Aust 			
Australian literature you please get in touch with these			
institutions these uh bodies 			
But by next year we are going to have lot of books 			
Penguin uh has got into Australian now some two three			
years ago 			
And they are bringing out a series of books 			
They are monographs and literary books 			
Recently they have brought out no less than I think forty			
to forty-five titles on Australian literature			
I have some with me uh specially one which is 			
which is the literary history of Australia it's an excellent			
book			
If you were to look at that book if you read that book you			
get to know everything about Australia specially about women studies 			
about aboriginal literature 			
There is so much common between India and Australia 			
And uh I am very hopeful by next year I think we are going to have			
 many more books 			
So from that we come to the beginnings of novel in India 			
Uh as all of us you know that drama lyrics and			
short stories and other forms of literature they have been there 			
both in England in Europe in India India since ages			
But drama I am sorry but novel came into existence only			
very recently			
This is a recent phenomenon 			
In England as all of us know the novel uh the origin of			
novel or flowering of novel I should say is uh uhm linked with			
Henry Fielding and Richardson eighteenth century 			
Uh we always say that it takes about hundred years for a			
movement to come to India from England or from Europe or from America 			
So but in Ind as far as India is concerned we have the			
first two novels in nineteenth century only 			
Uhm and uh there is the controversy which is the first			
novel 			
But we can talk of some first great novels and one of them is			
Chandu Menon's Indulekha 			
Now when we talk of a novel in India it has a different			
uh meaning connotation than what when we see novel in England or novel in			
Europe or novel in America 			
Because novel in India is a classic collective expressions 			
It comprises fiction from all regional literatures			
We don't have what is Indian literature we we can not define			
Indian literature			
Indian literature means literatures of all the regions 			
Hindi is uh just now a national language			
It doesn't have a identity of its own			
So Hindi could also be termed as only a regional literature			
So Hindi Urdu Marathi Bengali Punjabi these are all literatures			
and all put together they form Indian literature 			
So this is a collective expression			
So when we talk of Indian novel we talk of novel in all			
branches uhm in the country 			
Now how did it come to flourish ?			
In ninteenth century practically there was no novel 			
And uh uhm till uh middle of that nineteenth century there			
was no novel 			
It is precisely and mainly because of the efforts of Christian			
missionaries 			
When they came to India they wanted people to read Bible 			
and since they wanted people to read Bible they learnt our			
languages they learnt south Indian languages			
First of all Tamil uhm then Malyalam these languages they			
learnt			
And they translated the Bible into all living languages of			
that time 			
This is the basic uh so if you want to note down the			
certain points you can just say in point number one that uhm novel			
 as a literary phenomenon is new to India			
Now novel you put in double inverted commas 			
Novel as a the novel as a literary phenomenon is new to India			
We all know epics lyrics dramas short-stories fables 			
they've been they have there uh respectable uhm industries going			
back to several centuries 			
But it is only during the second half of nineteenth century 			
that novel took its root in in India 			
Now uh for the novel popularly popularly uh so called we have			
to wait till the second half of of nineteenth century 			
And it is because of uh western impact on so you can take down			
second point is that it's because of the western impact on India			
Western impact on India 			
This is because of the western impact that there was a formal			
development of prose			
And I said as I said that the Christian missionaries they			
wanted Indians to read the Bible so they read our languages and then			
they translated the Bible 			
So that gave a fillip to uh prose writing in our country			
And then from the prose medium it uh brought into currency 			
uh translation and then from a novel the proper 			
Then third point is write down that the term novel is a			
collective expression			
These are very important points			
So once you know these points you can explain them 			
Novel in India is a collective expression 			
It comprises fiction of some length produced in several 			
regional languages of India comprises fiction of some length produced in			
several regional languages of India like Bengali Hindi Urdu 			
Marathi Punjabi etcetera 			
Now as you know that it was mainly in Bengal that Indian			
literary renaissance took place in nineteenth century with the			
establishment of Sir William Fort college and uh setting up of a			
printing press in Sarempore by Christian missionaries 			
They they of course had motive was only			
to popularise Christianity			
But in the process it also gave fillip to the spread of education			
 and uh specially prose uh writing 			
Now once it became popular uh people started writing uh uh			
 prose and novels and uh the first attempt which was made 			
uh in south India was that of Chandu Menon when he wrote his novel			
 Indulekha 			
It has been rightly held as a first first significant novel			
 in Malyalam and also of course as a matter of fact in India			
But there is a controversy because there are so many so many			
novels written during those two three decades 			
So it is the first significant novel in Malyalam 			
It it was written in nine eighteen hundred eighty-nine and			
published in eighteen-ninety 			
It faced some controversy you know year this side or that side but			
these are the most recognized dates 			
Uhm now one thing we have to keep in mind is that Chandu			
Menon was not a professional writer 			
He was a judge by profession			
He was a lawyer then judge and he can be compared for that			
matter with Henry Fielding who was a lawyer and then a judge and it			
was his passtime 			
He was very fond of company over cup of tea he used to discuss			
novels 			
And uh he was greatly impre 			
impressed by English novels 			
And uhm very often he uh he felt that he should write			
a novel 			
And he was thoroughly impressed by English manners English			
people English language 			
Uh he was a typical Indian person who was uh accost to English			
culture and since he was in a very high position he was highly impressed by			
it cough 			
And uhm his wife was also of the same views 			
And very often she used to exhort him to write a novel 			
And one of his friends he uh suggested that uh there is a			
novel by Disreily and the name of the novel was which Henrietta some			
Henrietta I remember uh he wanted him to uh this is Henrietta			
Temple			
Please just write down the name of the novel 			
This was written by Benjamin Disreily 			
 Henrietta's spellings are H E N H E N R I E T T			
A Henrietta Temple 			
This is the name of the novel by Disreily 			
And his friend asked him to translate the novel 			
Chalk with a chalk in my hand and a black board at my			
disposal because that is what we are all use to 			
But uh this is some sort of a formal lecture in a sense that I			
will not be able to move from the uh dais uh here 			
Now I have chosen for my talk today a subject 			
India's science and technology policy and the possible role of			
universities in its implementation 			
While choosing this topic I had two view points in mind 			
First that as citizens rather than as teachers you should			
know in what direction our government is moving 			
What should be the basis of our technological programmes			
 and how should we really go about it 			
Secondly I thought that as teachers of the university you			
should know what we should be doing in order to assist our national			
programmes			
And therefore partly informative partly I could say a			
request of what you should really be doing 			
Now if you look into the history of mankind you will find that right			
from the beginning say from the invention of the wheel you have			
found that the scientific discovery has been followed by some sort of a			
major sociological development or economic development where the life			
patterns have changed 			
You as I said you could start with the invention of the wheel			
 you could come to the industrial revolution where the steam-engine			
brought the revolution or you could come to the present day where the			
computer uh chip is bringing about such a revolution 			
And therefore it is very essential to plan our scientific			
programmes 			
So you can say that the industrial revolution which swept			
Europe say in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries highlighted the			
fact that the economic growth of a nation is largely depend upon the			
scientific and technological advances it can achieve 			
And therefore we must have a consistance science and technology			
policy 			
Now you may have a policy it may be perfectly laid down 			
every step may be taken care of but you can implement that policy only			
 if the proper environment is present and if you have got a trained			
personnels to implement that policy 			
This applies not only to science and technology it applies to			
every aspect of life take even our teaching programmes 			
We may know that our M Sc syllabii for example must contain A B			
C D 			
We also know that all these things must be taught			
But unless the whole atmosphere in the university is such that			
we can really teach those aspects and we got trained personnels who are			
capable of teaching we find that this sort of thing doesn't work 			
And therefore the first point we must always remember while			
considering any policy and in this case the science and technology policy is			
 that the proper background has got to be developed 			
Thus you will find that when we finally come to the			
implementation of the national policies the brunt will have to come			
 on the university and on the teaching system			
Because we are going to provide them the men who are going to			
later uh act and who who in the years to come are going to lead our			
scientific and technological development 			
Now this aspect was well thought out by our national			
leaders even before we became independent 			
The science and technology policy gre owes a great			
deal to the foresight of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru 			
Even before we achieved independence in the days of			
pre-independence uh you will find that in one of the In uh 			
uh Indian National Congresses he had outlined our policies in nineteen			
hundred forty-six when his Discovery of India came out			
 there were statements which clearly showed that he realized 			
that the social upliftment of the people was not possible unless a basic			
scientific policy was designed 			
And I'll just quote one sentence from his 			
Discovery of India which will let you know what his thinking			
was this in quotes is open quote It is science alone that can			
 solve the problems of hunger and poverty of insanitation and			
illiteracy of superstition and deadening customs and traditions of			
vast resources running to waste of a rich country inhabitate by starving			
 people 			
And therefore looking at all the problems he tried to set			
right the scientific background 			
And while setting right the scientific background he did not			
 think in terms of the natural uh resources alone in terms of say			
 laboratory development but he emphasised the need of what is known as			
the scientific temper 			
So the very basis of the science and technology policy as			
visualized by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the development of a scientific			
temper 			
Even in any field this could be uh applied and it basically			
means that you should be able to think in a logical manner you should be			
able to find out what are the next steps you are going to do and what that is			
going to lead to 			
Whether your uh actions are correct or incorrect whether			
they can be supported or not supported that is what the scientific			
attitude or the scientific temper or the scientific way of thinking means 			
and that is what he emphasised			
So the basic understanding is that you should first			
learn to think logically and to act logically 			
Now with this background he set about uh to			
creating a background on which technologicl development took place 			
Firstly we all know that he said that we have got to			
provide better technologies which would enable the country to progress more			
rapidly 			
The spinning wheel or the charkha had its			
own symbolic value			
It had its value as far as the villages were con 			
 concerned 			
But simply by producing say khadi we			
would not survive in the world of competition			
And therefore for a even such a small thing as a			
 charkha he introduced the mechanized type of 			
charkha which is known as the amber charkha or it			
was known as the amber charkha in those days 			
Similarly he said about building dams 			
Uh he said about bui building 			
 up heavy industries			
In fact the knowledge that the storage of water was essential			
for our agricultural development led to our policy of big dams			
It was at that time in the early uh the late uh say uh			
late forties and early fifties that we thought of Hirakud and uh Bhakra			
and so on 			
And in those days he emphasised that dams our are the			
temples of modern India			
He did not want people to go uh to uh a temple in the religious			
way think of a temple in a religious way but he thought that objects 			
which could be emulated which could serve as a symbol of			
progress should be our real temples 			
At the same time he set about setting up large research			
laboratories			
The first was of course the National Chemical Laboratory at			
Poona then you have the National Physical Laboratory and a chain of National			
Laboratories came uh forward 			
Today there are people and there is who think that these			
steps were probably not in our best interest			
For example uh you may say that a dam probably gave us water			
it probably gave us electricity but it did not take care of the ecological			
aspects or of the environmental aspects 			
You can say that a national laboratory created certain			
small centres of excellence but the money poured into the national laboratory			
 deprived you can say the university			
These are things we which we find in hind-side			
But it is the fore-sight that you have got to build up a scientific			
base which was Nehru's real contribution to our			
development 			
And in terms of this uh contribution the first thing that			
India did was in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight when it adopted what			
was known as a scientific policy resolution 			
Do you mind if I treated it like a class-room sir ?			
Because they will otherwise not be able to take down anything ahn			
It was at this point that we adopted in nineteen hundred			
and fifty-eight what is known as the scientific policy 			
resolution 			
Now this scientific policy res 			
resolution was aimed at providing the basis for our scientific			
programmes in future 			
Now what are the main points of this scientific policy resolution ?			
The first major point was to foster promote and			
sustain the cultivation of science and scientific research in all aspects			
 pure applied and educational 			
So the promotion of research was the main framework or			
the main bullwork on which our science policy was based 			
The second point was to ensure an adequate supply of			
research scientist of high quality 			
It was this was also considered necessary not only the scientific			
equipment but the scientific personnel 			
The third uh point was to encourage and initiate with			
all possible speed programmes for the training of scientific and			
technical persons 			
The next was to ensure that creative talent is encouraged			
 and finds full scope in scientific activity 			
And encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and			
desimination of knowledge and for discovery of new knowledge 			
And lastly to secure for the people of the country all the			
benefits that can accrue from the acquisition and application of			
scientific knowledge 			
So these are the points which I will give you later 			
But here we have got to emphasis the fact that what was			
required was one bui building up the			
scientific infra infrastructure 			
Second building up this uh scientific personnel required			
Third was to ensure that scientific knowledge was			
dessiminated to the people 			
And above all what is most important was to see that any			
scientific uh programme or any scientific discovery did not lie in			
science alone but it was transmitted to the people 			
Now in much later you will find that uh in the late eighties			
this came out in the form of our technological mission which I will talk to			
about later 			
But the building up of the infrastructure the building up of			
the personnel require the transformation of information and the			
transformation of the benefits of science to uh the rural popu			
 uhn people or to the poorer section that was the main thrust or the			
main basis of our science policy as formulated in nineteen hundred and			
fifty-eight 			
Uh the one word basic difficulty about this 			
scientific policy resolution which the Lok Sabha adopted was			
 it spoke of science but it did not spoke speak 			
 of technology 			
So the next step came in nineteen hundred and			
seventy-three when a national committee for science and technology 			
was formed to advise on how the scientific achievements or the scientific			
material could be transferred into technology			
And that is when the people came in 			
Now this uh committee on science and technology 			
presented an approach paper in nineteen hundred seventy three 			
So this is the science and technology committee report 			
And this science and technology committee report emphasised			
again four or five points which are firstly the resources			
allotted to research and development in India and other developing			
countries were grossly inadequate			
That was the first point 			
The second the transfer or import of technology from			
developed countries was not in the interest of developing countries 			
Thirdly many required technologies could be indigenously 			
developed 			
Fourthly quality and relevance of education in schools and			
universities had to be ensured so as to stop the stupendest waste			
in human resources 			
And next an adequate machinery had to be set up to monitor			
 evaluate correct and redirect various programmes in science and			
 technology 			
Now if you look at the basic points of the report of the			
nineteen hundred and seventy-three science and technology committee you			
will find that they said what we are still saying in nineteen hundred and			
ninety-one that is the eighteen years later 			
We are not saying anything quite new we are again stating			
the same fact that we don't have enough money for research that we should			
not import technology from outside we should develop our own technology			
 the quality of our education should improve and that an adequate			
machinery should be formed to transfer the benefits of science to society			
So in other words though our thinking process have been proper			
 though we have realized what should be done though we know the path			
on which we have to travel we are not being able to implement it 			
And this if you can recall brings uh that out my opening			
remarks that what is necessary is not only a science and technology			
policy but the environment to promote that policy and the personnel to			
promote the policy 			
If after twenty years we still can not find an answer to			
 uh the questions which we set ourselves uh a long time back then			
there is something wrong and that wrong is that we have not developed the			
right attitude in which our scientific development can take place			
Then the next step is in nineteen hundred and eighty 			
three when the government gave what is known as the technology			
policy statement 			
Now this technology policy statement tried to say			
what should be our programmes of technological development 			
And this is essentially something which is more or less a			
repeat of what has been visualized in the science and technology 			
policy 			
So the government issued in nineteen eighty-three the technology			
policy statement according to which the basic objectives of a 			
nation's technology policy were stated to be firstly development			
of indigenous technology 			
Second acquisition of imported technology and its efficient			
absorption and adaption appropriate to national priorities and resources			
 			
What stupid ideas are getting hold of all of us 			
And the teachers have also become trade unionists 			
They also hold the university 			
I mean who who is the university ?			
The Vice-chancellor of the university or the teachers who teach			
they are the university 			
It is an association 			
This is my definition university is an association of			
students and teachers in pursuit of scholarship 			
Scholarship is the only measure of the performance of the			
university 			
If you don't have scholarship you are nothing 			
And we want teachers who are great scholars like those			
great Rishis of ancient times 			
People who are dedicated who are motivated whose whole purpose is			
 the pursuit of knowledge and the application of knowledge to the			
contemporary problems 			
Now we have to produce such man such power such knowledge			
power in our universities 			
I am very fond of constantly quoting the ideas of John Kenneth			
Galbraith the economist who has pointed out that in the			
feudal times or even the earlier times slave times the 			
your wealth depended on the number of slaves you can command 			
I have one thousand slaves at my disposal I am a bigger man 			
than another with hundred slaves at his disposal 			
Then came feudalism and they said that a man who has one			
thousand acres is bigger than a man who owns			
hundred acres 			
So the land that was the measure of feudalism 			
Then came capitalism 			
If I have one crore or I am a millionnaire I			
am bigger than a man who has only some hundreds 			
Money became the measure 			
So control over men was the measure at one phase of the history 			
over land in the second phase of history over money in the third phase of			
history			
Now what is the measure of today ?			
What is the measure of today ?			
The knowledge that you produce 			
The knowledge that you apply 			
Knowledge is the measure of performance today 			
Therefore universities have to be successive from this			
point of view they have to produce knowledge			
Now there is poverty of research in the Indian university 			
whether in science natural sciences social sciences			
No uh new idea generates no new research has come out no			
new books are prepared some useless text-books are prepared and they			
are the stuff nutrition on which the student community is fed 			
Now with such poor nutrition of third rate text-books I			
mean you ask the students of economics he has not read journals 			
John Maynard Keynes' general theory of employment interest			
in money one word 			
Kanes who is that ?			
And what is his book ?			
And why should we read it ?			
Now this is our way of looking at things 			
So uh we need to give great attention to the quality of			
teachers and to the quality of students 			
And the academic staff colleges are intended to produce a better			
quality of teachers			
A very good idea 			
I hope academic staff colleges also do not deteriorate 			
And do not become a ritual 			
You see there has to be a perennial and continous			
process of renewal to be just what we are 			
Even a Vice- chancellor will not be of any use unless he renews			
himself constantly 			
By the one word that I have diclosed in the last few			
minutes you would have known by now that I am not such an ignorant			
person about the scene of higher education 			
After all I was not an educationist I was in the Indian			
administration 			
But I have been constantly reading about the scene of higher			
education			
In fact I began after the moment I came here I said where			
is Radhakrishnan Commission ?			
Let me see it first 			
Where is Kothari Commission ?			
Where are the other what are the other writing ?			
What are the new thoughts ? 			
So nobody should take any field without becoming a thorough 			
 pandit in that particular field that is the mark and that is			
the approach of an academic 			
Even as an administrator I followed the same method 			
Now I might have been wanting thoroughly but at least that was			
my effort and that was my approach 			
So therefore how do we continuously recharge the batteries			
of our teachers 			
Now this is a recharging battery academic staff college is a			
battery recharging process 			
So that when you go you are brightened refreshed you			
are a new person and your personality changes and the students must say			
 is this the same teacher who has come back 			
Some thing has gone wrong but you know you become different teacher			
This is what should happen after you go back 			
You must be full of new ideas full of new energies full of new			
approaches 			
You must electrify the atmosphere when you go back			
This is this is the mark of success of a programme like I hope			
it will happen here also 			
You must go and electrify the atmosphere when you go back 			
The movement you go back the brightness must spread 			
So will this happen ?			
You see there are even in modern times we believe that			
in addition to self-teaching or teaching on the job yourself there is			
an institution of process involved 			
I belong to the great Indian administrative service which is			
the successor to a greater what people call a greater service for the			
Indian civil service of the colonial times 			
Now in those days there was no training 			
The I C S did not believe in this kind of formal our institutional			
training 			
They believed in training on the job 			
The senior man trains the junior fellow 			
And in those days the links betweeen the senior and the junior			
 were more personal 			
Yes there is also something in that 			
But there is also more in the process of institutionalization			
And it is only after in independence 			
 that a number of institutions of training of civil servants			
came into existence			
It became a big business 			
And that is how in my career I headed no less than four 			
institutions of research and training connected with one part or the			
other of our administrative system 			
Uh Rajiv Gandhi was a great believer and the first question			
he asked was whether chief secretary of the states and the join			
secretary at the centre or even the secretaries and ministers whether			
they were getting any training 			
This is the question Rajiv Gandhi asked 			
It was part of his modernism 			
And as a result of that for the first time for the big bossess			
 who consider themselves beyond all training ministers are beyond all			
training they don't need anything they know everything and the in			
Hindi I A S fellow knows everything 			
Now that theory is no longer considered to be valid 			
And he definitely the credit of starting such			
programme for higher civil servants and ministers goes to Rajiv			
Gandhi 			
Though I must say in the earlier days of S K Dey where I			
was also the director we use to get senior civil servants as well as even			
ministers in those days MLA's 			
But in recent times in the whole gamut of public administration			
this was started 			
Now the U G C has started it on the academic side the same who			
is good you cannot be standard			
Now our teachers are notorious for using the same notes for			
the whole of the teaching career 			
What was given by Dhananjayrao Gadgil when I passed my M A same			
notes I go on using for twenty-five years 			
Now the fact of the matter is such is the dynamism of			
knowledge the explosion of knowledge what that what you said			
yesterday does not hold good today 			
A syllabus came in economics and it said the socialistic			
economic system experience of Russia and East European countries			
Now where is socialism ?			
What kind of socialism are you talking of ?			
Things change so rapidly not only in the realm of			
knowledge but also in the external world 			
And the objectives of programme such as this is to constantly			
 bring you up today both in your subject matter because we have			
subject matter programmes in respect of methodology which is also			
important methodology of teaching 			
And thirdly the general environment in which you work 			
University is considered to be an Ivory tower			
Yes to an extent it is an Ivory tower 			
But this Ivory tower of education is not unconnected with			
the economic environment social environment political environment			
technological environment cultural environment in which we carry on our whole			
process of education 			
And therefore we ought to know this environment 			
We cannot be frogs in the well dealing only with a commerce			
accountancy and the like			
I mean you have to know the whole frame-work 			
And therefore this general programme of orientation which			
will tell you about the changing environment in politics 			
economics in society in technology in culture within India and			
without India 			
I therefore hope that uh such a programme will not be			
considered by you an irrelevant 			
What is this programme it is not in the syllabus of Botany ?			
This is not a question to be asked here 			
We are not here concern with Botany or Zoology or Economics or			
Commerce or Political Science or Education or Hindi or English in pursuing			
We are concerned with these wider frame-work 			
And I hope that uh you will understand the importance of these			
wider frame-work that you will interact I mean in all this it is			
not the traditional process where the teacher knows everything and			
the student now it has become reverse			
The student feels that he knows everything and the teacher			
knows nothing and he talks some nonsense and we have to tolerate 			
This is the new approach to education that seems to be			
evolving in our country 			
A student in Goa university got ten marks and he failed and he			
promptly writes me ten letters saying that the teachers don't know uh			
how to uh evaluate and they have wrongly put me at ten and it is a			
great injustice to me 			
Now what do you do ?			
Therefore we have to create the institutional approach			
 for the enhancement and the upgradation of the capability of our teachers			
But much will depend on the teachers themselves			
How you participate ?			
What you get of the programme will depend will depend on 			
how you what effort you made to get out the programme 			
If you come out if you bring up your ideas and your			
experience and to share it with others you will find that apart from			
the expert who'll be giving you lectures you will benefit more			
by your interaction with each other 			
This will be your transformation from a teacher you will			
become a student from an older person you will suddenly become a young			
person 			
This transformation I hope the programme will bring about 			
It a programme like this makes you younger it reduces your			
age straight by twenty years 			
So if you are forty your age becomes twenty 			
And that happens for a teacher also 			
The teacher should not go on uh blabbering in an old way 			
but uh he must come out with all the energy of new knowledge and new			
curiosity and the pleasure that is there between communication 			
between human beings 			
Communication between human beings is a very big process 			
It changes 			
It is not communication of one from one to one 			
One becomes hundred in the process of communication 			
So I hope all these processes will take place and as a			
result of uh this programme you will go happier uh more uh delighted			
refreshed committed and uh you will then go back and would			
not keep what you have taken to yourselves 			
But would share it with your fellow teachers with your			
colleagues with your students and with the academic community of			
which you are a part 			
So in all this uh process of education and its dessimination			
 I wish you all very well 			
I don't know whether what I have said amounts to any key note			
address 			
I had not uh prepared myself formally to deliever it but uh			
 I share what I felt on the occasion with you all 			
Once again I must uh give my heartful thanks to the			
Vice-chancellor for uh allowing us to come here and provide the			
forum for the conduct of the activities of the academic staff college 			
And I am grateful to Dr Devasthali for providing the			
co-ordination at the level here in this university 			
I thank them heartly on behalf of Goa university and on behalf			
of myself 			
And I wish well to you to the participants in the			
programme and to the programme itself			
Thank you very much 			
Good morning 			
Uh this is a short paper called Teaching classics in an			
unclassical situation 			
Uh I didn't know what to do when I received a letter from uh			
Professor Vanikar uh asking me to participate in a lecture			
series 			
So I thought that I must write a lecture 			
But I didn't know that this is all this 			
But anyway I I hope you'll bear uh these peculiar			
things from a teacher who has been trying to teach something impossible			
 uh for several years 			
When the Indira Gandhi Open University was			
launched some years ago somebody mentioned to me why an open university			
was needed then 			
Most of the Northern universities had to be closed for long			
spells of time owing to one agitation or the other 			
And they had been sealed closed 			
The only university that could be open then was the open one			
 which could not be closed 			
When I asked in a time honoured university a few years ago 			
where was the student ?			
The teacher said since attendance was voluntary the			
students were not around 			
This had shocked me then thoroughly 			
But when the same reason was given by another set of teachers 			
in another university equally respected just a few days ago I			
was not so much dismayed as amused 			
A university now was getting one word of becoming 			
a fossil 			
A discarded image and a discreditable model 			
We say the teacher you have to squeeze the university into			
museum and a teacher into a zoo now 			
When teaching itself has become a well-nigh lost art practised			
 before the modern stone age teaching a classic should be a gargantuan			
to an absurdity or a quixotic misadventure 			
But though the teaching of a classic really belong to the realm			
of such a dark and hopeless comedy my experience with both the			
classics and the teaching has been mercifully otherwise 			
I may be allowed to boast that even like the classics			
themselves I've survived as a teacher teaching classics			
 that too in an Indian situation 			
At the movement I need not define a classic since everyone			
knows what it is since you have to know what a thing is even to			
reject it 			
 I'll rather explain what an unclassical situation is			
Apart from the unclassical situation in the West itself 			
which even Milton feared in his own time whether he was writing his epic			
in an age too late in a cold climate my damp is intended flight 			
The Indian situation for the western classics especially the			
ancient one is apparently precarious 			
Homer or Virgil Dante or Milton are not only not read in			
the schools or undergraduate classes here perhaps with exception of some			
Milton but well are unheard of 			
There is no grounding or even interest in pagan mythology or			
christian thought of any real depth before the students join the			
post graduate classes 			
Nor is there any serious attention to the history of ideas 			
or evolution of the western culture is Greek or Roman Christian texture			
Any knowledge of Greek and Latin or even a gentle fascination			
for them is anywhere in sight is nowhere in sight 			
Again there is no knowledge or sense of the genuises rise			
evolution and decay of the stars of epic tragedies romance 			
allegory etcetera 			
Nor is there a critical awareness or discuss 			
 discussions or the matters involved in the study of			
the classics among the extremist either 			
In short as far the teaching of the classics is concerned you			
are working in a thorough vacuum 			
Though your teacher's nature may abhor it 			
If you have to reach the students with your classics in your uh			
 ah in your hand you have to undertake the adventure of piercing			
through a silence of seven-fold or nine-fold or manifold ignorance 			
But should you despair and give up the sword of teaching then			
as a sheer wild goose chase 			
 I've an emphatic no to say to this			
pessimism 			
It is possible to put those classics across to the students 			
Indian students not because they are the one word or credilous			
 but because the classics have an intrensic power in themselves			
 on the one hand and students have an intrensic an instinctive			
responsiveness to them on the other 			
Should a classic fail it's a pity 			
Something must be wrong either with the teacher or with the			
student and between them they have missed an opportunity of a life-time			
It is a challenge for any teacher to steer an ancient classic			
through successfully in a class without being assisted by a cultivated			
response in it 			
But I think the solution to the problem should be divide			
another way 			
Instead of being exasperated by a classical innocent class a			
teacher has to exploit the virgin field and convert innocence into an			
advantage 			
The basic wealth he should realize lies in the			
responsiveness of the class to any literature our literature British			
or one's own 			
Once he's sure of the aesthetic or literary sensibility			
 so he can find a way for the classic into the imagination of his students			
When I say that a literary awareness is the most vital factor I			
do not employ that a classic should be reduced to an easily knowable text			
The teacher should have a complex economy at his command 			
He must know uh the right dosage of each element before he			
administers a classic to the open minded class students of			
the class 			
Were one to teach for example Homer's 			
Illiad I I've taken just one example 			
One must know how much of the theory of the epic of growth or			
archeology he must give to his students 			
If you get lost in the theory of the oral or authentic epic you			
may not reach Homer at all 			
On the contrary you may raise serious suspicion in the			
minds of the students whether a poet called Homer ever existed at all 			
Having introduced the term authentic oral epic you gently			
pass on to the Homeric age or the heroic age not as a fossil of			
history but as a genuine milieu for the creation and sustenance of the			
kind of epic that Illiad is 			
If the students know nothing of the heroic age Achilles would			
cut an utterly sorry figure before them a spoiled child a wilful			
imbecile 			
Personal honour then was supreme and dying for glory the			
consummation devastly wished by a hero was his name 			
The co-ordinates of the age co-ordinate coincide with the			
co-ordinates of the morality of the hero 			
The Lords have donned a heroic society have to be 			
ac accepted in a spirit of willing suspension of			
disbelief or of a voluntary poetic accent 			
By this the epic is saved an enormous infancy of			
primitivity 			
With a select historisity in mind you go straight to the human			
condition 			
So that given differing historical co-ordinate 			
There is an unerring core of the human fate involved 			
Once the right key note is struck the classic is preserved 			
Similarly you have to introduce them to the rules of the epic			
game the conventions the invocation the catalogues of men and			
ships and so on 			
The strolling epic simile the ruthlessly delightful			
battlefields the feudal games the lamentations etcetera 			
And then the gods their politics their devious ways 			
their over-determinations of human affairs and man's constant			
negotiations with them 			
The supernatural frame-work not to be reduced to the			
supernatural machinery that they use one word but to be kept 			
as a mysterious divine environment in which man has to struggle rise			
afore 			
You have to identify and establish the force of gravity 			
that holds in tension the fears of men 			
All this has to be done not in a spirit of solemn scholarship 			
but as a matter of enlighten information to hinder the hindrances to			
enjoying such works 			
But this is only half the work 			
You have to get the work closer to the world of the students'			
 own experience or sensibility 			
I have been trying to do this task not by denuding Homer of its			
specific but by gathering him to a vision of what I might describe as			
 poets' perennial 			
The perennial poetry which refuses to divide poetic experience			
or vision in a parochial way and reduce reduce it to a poets'			
 parochialist uh provincial poetry 			
Explain the unknown Homer in terms of the known of			
 the Upanishadas the Vedas the Bhagwatgeetas the			
Mahabharat and the Ramayan and the Bhagwat 			
Do not tell me that our own works are less known to our			
students than the western classics 			
I have been doing in this way from long before the TV's			
 had serialised the Mahabharat and 			
the Ramayan 			
Our work the culture that they are embodiments of our			
already embedded in the instinctive responses of our students 			
And they have to be carefully and convincingly evoked by the			
teacher 			
Let me give just a couple of examples in a characteristically			
comprehensive Homeric statement 			
In the thick of the battle Dimades challenges Glocus and Glocus			
replies what does any lineage matter to you 			
Men in the generations are like the leaves of the tree 			
The wind blows and one years leaves are scattered on the ground			
 but the tree is burst into buds and put on fresh ones when the			
spring comes round 			
In the same way one generation flourishes and the another nears			
its end 			
This inevitably reminded me of the statement from the 			
Katho Upanishad Satya mevap madhya pakshatye sasya mev			
tasya mev ajayte punha 			
The muscle hyphens and ripens ends like corn and stalks			
up again like corn 			
The metaphor of the leaves in Homer corresponds greatly with			
metaphor of the corn in the Katho Upanishad 			
And both bring out vividly and crystalize the phenomenon of			
mutability 			
The cycle of birth death and rebirth 			
The Homeric metaphor as that of the Upanishadic unites			
human experience so effectively that you cease to separate the west from			
the east and start inhabiting a common state of human faith 			
To cite another example from the Illiad itself			
 here is Andromache Illiad book six trying to			
persuade her husband Hector not to go to the fatal battlefield 			
 So you Hector are father and mother and brother to			
me as well as my beloved husband 			
Have pity on me now stay here on the tar 			
Put beside this a statement from the Ramayana			
 made by Seeta as a confession of Rama's love for her			
 before Anusuya 			
This is Ayodhyakand one eighteen four uh			
 Seetanurago dharmatma matrivat pitravat priyah 			
With this kind of a parallel so this is I think you will know			
this Sanskrit I mean the student 			
Seeta in love righteous dear like the father the mother 			
With the kind of a parallel in mind you do not wish to separate			
the two works the two culture and see them in isolation a bridge			
is flown across the two 			
And the one text reinforces and illuminates the other the			
phobia that a stranger one word is dissipated and an Indian			
reader student teacher is gratified that a common humanity pervades text			
apparently separated by differing cultures and languages 			
When I say this I am not way laying the students into the			
phony field of the comparative literature as such but only knocking down			
walls or barriers that separates two literatures 			
It is a matter of of nativising alien an alien			
literature not by sipping it of its specifics but by opening a new			
channel of communication 			
So many problems of interpretation both literary and			
theological can be lightened by calling to aid works like the			
Mahabharat Ramayan Bhagwat and pressing them to a			
service to to into service to gain and access into a pre-Christian			
work like Illiad which raises insoluble problems in			
the mind of western Christian reader 			
I have tried to put across Illiad without			
tearing off its Roman roots to my students by a free use of material 			
from our ancient texts 			
The benefit has been double if not multiple 			
Our students have freely enter the western classics with a native			
appreciation of them on the one hand and I've seen the relevance			
 and significance of our own work on the other 			
There was a time when the professor of English looked down			
upon our works in a bid to outer English to English 			
Those days I wish to believe are behind us but that			
also implies a responsibility a need to emancipate oneself from			
bookishness into a heaven of genuine learning 			
 I've been tackling works like the Illiad 			
Paradise Lost The Divine Comedy with an amount of freedom			
to release the classics from the prison of impenetrability or mere tacit			
riven and make them speak to us as living works 			
 I've also been trying to light up areas of darkness 			
in interpreting our own works like the Mahabharat Ramayan			
the Bhagwat all these or the Bhagwatgeeta 			
by a constant reference to the Illiad the Aeneid Paradise Lost			
or The Divine Comedy so that a new discourse is generated 			
by the free jostling together of great works 			
This has helped remove to a great extent the grimness 			
or the the gravity the solemnity that seem to weigh upon our own works			
 fallen on the trodden ways of orthodoxy 			
The use of the Bible both the old and the new Testament 			
the entire western mystical tradition uh has been of great benefit in			
the interpretation of our own works too 			
Here again the walls of prejudice and wooden scholarship collapse			
 and the great work starts becoming parts of the same space the			
aesthetic and the ethical 			
 I've also been getting appreciable success bringing			
together the Greek and the Shakespearian tragedies 			
Understanding a Greek phenomenon with a Shakespearian example 			
or vice-versa 			
Should I read more and be conversant with Sanskrit drama I			
hope to understand the more by a kind of a cross irradiation 			
What I've uh been doing with the ancient classics 			
classics should be possible with the post- renaissance modern and			
post-modern works too 			
But one needs to be sailing the razor edge path of one if one were			
not to mess up things 			
This kind of activity needs a great expansion of mind an			
intellectual tolerance that makes holding many peaks of excellance or			
phenomenon of significance together simultaneously without reducing or			
abolishing the uniqueness of each 			
I also felt always that a teacher needs to be free from any			
obsession with one particular theory of literature or or			
criticism			
If you they want to save themselves			
from the dangers of distortion 			
At the same time he must be fully aware of the whole plethora			
of the theory so that he is able to make use of them freely 			
even as an electronics engineer uses a thousand of keys to produce a			
unified effect 			
I may however say that my key to the classics is only a key a			
key and I do not know of a master-key which can unlock uh the			
treasures of all literature 			
I do not exactly know where I stand as regard to theme of the			
lecture series creative writing and literature teaching interphase 			
But this much I can say that literature teaching is not 			
much less creative than creative writing itself 			
In fact you create as you teach 			
And a creative work unless it is creatively read remains just			
a close book it does not become a text to borrow a term from Burke			
It is a teacher who stigmaties to teach a text can really			
transform it into what it really is a text which requires as			
Burke would say an attempt to abolish or atleast to lessen the			
distance between writing and reading not by intensifying the readers 			
projection into the work but by linking the two together in a single			
signifying process 			
A teacher if he succeeds does reduce the distance between			
writing and reading 			
He rewrites the works and reincarnate the text everytime			
 he successfully performs in a class 			
Thank you 			
The Vice-chancellor of Goa University and today's			
 chief guest Dr Dubhashi Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Shivaji			
University Dr Yadav Dr Fernandes Dr Devasthali my			
colleagues from the Shivaji University and the participants in this			
orientation programme 			
It is a pleasure to be associated with the inauguration of the			
twenty-second orientation programme being organized by the			
academic staff college of Goa University 			
This also happens to be the second programme we are organizing			
in Kolhapur 			
And I am grateful to the Vice-Chancellor of Goa University and			
to his colleagues for taking all trouble of co 			
coming over to Kolhapur every year and organizing such a			
programme			
Without this attitude of yours I think it may have been			
difficult for many of our lady participants to take advantage of 			
the facility which the University Grants Commission is offering 			
At the outset I would like to welcome Dr Dubhashi to this			
campus on a formal basis 			
He has visited us on a couple of occasions but was 			
 that was more of a personal visit and today we have had the pleasure			
of having him here to give the key note address of this orientation			
programme 			
Dr Dubhashi enjoys a unique position amongst the			
vice-Chancellors of India 			
Most vice-Chancellors like myself look upon the job from			
inwards 			
We have been a part of the university system and we see 			
only what we have been seeing for say twenty-five thirty years 			
But Dr Dubhashi being an administrator and an administrator			
 par excellence has the advantage of looking at the			
education system from outside after taking into account what is			
present therein 			
And I am sure this these two factors being			
able to see from the view point of others and to able to understand			
your own problems will go a long way in seeing that the Goa			
University develops at a very rapid rate 			
I have had the previlege of hearing him at two or three			
conferences 			
And I must say that all have been impressed with the fresh			
view points which he has been presenting 			
Dr Dubashi has jokingly said that we should not underestimate			
Goa no sir we certainly do not do so 			
We understand Goa is a place where there is an integration of			
two cultures where the temple of Mangeshi stands next to			
the old Cathedral of Goa where the scenic beauty provides the			
very necessary background for the development of the cultures and where			
you have got research institutes of the stature of the National			
Institute of Oceanography 			
We know therefore that Goa is an education centre Goa			
is a place which can really provide something new in terms of			
knowledge something new in terms of developng the human mind 			
And it is therefore our beloved previlege sir to share			
from your staff member as well as from ours the a different			
view point on culture a different view point on history and a			
different view point on scientific achievements and the ways 			
education should develop 			
Dr Dubhashi had mentioned the conference of vice-			
Chancellors of Commonwealth universities at Dehli which was held			
earlier this year 			
One of the main problems which was discussed at this			
conference was that of mediocrity Vs excellence and quantity Vs			
quality			
I am putting it the other way to what the westerners			
would put it because today in India in the education system at least			
we find that mediocrity and quantity has held a sway over quality and			
excellence 			
And what is absolutely essential from the point of view of the			
development of education in India is that excellence should be there			
If there is excellence with quantity I'll be very 			
proud of it 			
But at least excellence in smaller amounts would be absolutely			
essential before we can really give to the next generation what they			
deserve 			
And from this point of view the concept of academic staff			
colleges which the University Grants Commission has developed in recent years			
 was is of great importance 			
It is unless we train our minds unless we enlarge our own			
knowledge I do not think we can deliver to the students 			
What Dr Dubhashi has again mentioned that the students has			
an idea that what they are getting is really something which is old and			
outdated 			
Many years ago I read in the Readers' Digest			
 a small anecdote which they usually publish but which has			
stuck to my mind 			
In the scenario was two young children of about five			
or six were playing in the school courtyard 			
An aeroplane went over 			
One child said It is a V H naming some uh number of			
the aircraft 			
The other said no no it is a V uh nine look at the			
angle of the wings 			
And then the bell rang 			
And then one child says to the another Now let's			
 go back and count those silly bits laughter 			
So it is a fact from knowledge the young younger			
generation know so much more that probably we probably we			
 who never had that training in our uh younger days would not be able			
to transmit it			
And therefore this question of upgrading of knowledge has to be			
taken very very seriously 			
As Dr Fernandes has pointed out the Academic Staff College has			
 three or four major objectives 			
These are giving you the skill for meeting the new			
challenges making you aware of the linkages of education with society 			
making you aware of the current trends in knowledge making you aware			
 of the educational technology and giving you a practical aspect 			
to what you are going to do 			
And I think all of these are very important from the point 			
of view of a teacher 			
You will find that the new challenges which are being put			
 before before us will require absolutely new			
skills			
What I as a student learned would probably be next to			
useless			
I just cannot handle a computer 			
But a school ch ch child 			
today knows the basics of computers			
He can handle it			
And five years later unless we all can handle the skill I don't			
think we will be able to give anything in terms of knowledge to our			
students 			
What is most important is having an awareness of the linkage			
between education and society 			
Many years ago we had the traditional system of education where 			
the teacher lived in his ivory tower he dealt with different			
aspects of his subject he gained knowledge he distributed the			
knowledge 			
But it was all very abstract 			
And what Sidney Smith said was very important the teacher			
 had the right to do everything 			
In a university system you had the right to be wrong 			
That was the uh expression there that even if a teacher			
taught something which was very abstract which was wrong it was his right and			
the right to be the wrong was one of the biggest previleges of a			
university 			
Today the times have changed 			
The whole social system is financing your education and			
therefore you have something to pay back to uh society 			
And this is the university society linkage which has got to be			
very important 			
The third aspect is also of developing our knowledge 			
Today we are in an age where you have to draw from every other			
subject before you can really put forward what your own subject says 			
And this I don't think can be done on the basis of what 			
uh we have learned during our bachelor's programme or in our 			
master's programme			
We have got to go to the right and left and we have got to			
draw from every source which we had 			
Uh later in this afternoon I will be telling you or I'll			
 be talking to you regarding the science and technology policy how our			
science and technology has developed uh since the days of freedom and			
what are the problems 			
Now one of the basic problems which I will try to tell you is that			
our background has not been broad enough 			
And it is from this point of view just like it is essential			
for the scientist to know his ancient heritage and his culture it is very			
necessary for the uh uh student of social sciences to know what the			
scientific development is			
And it is from this point of view that uh we will have			
to enlarge 			
Again when we transmit our knowledge there are certain			
techniques and then there are certain skills and there are certain			
limitations 			
Very uh jokingly I will tell you one thing that uh when I			
 had something to do with the educational mis uh me media			
research centre at Poona University they were developing cassettes 			
And at that time one thing was said that when it's only an			
audio cassette one only if there is a speaker and there is			
nothing else to be seen the cassette should not be more than fifteen			
minutes or eighteen minutes because you do not hold the interest of a student			
for more than that period laughter 			
In brief a teacher uh uh a speaker should be not 			
should not dwelt too much on a uh special topic 			
Dr Dubhashi has drawn our attention to the fact that there			
is something wrong with our national spirit 			
We have come to a stage where we have become very much			
dependent upon other countries 			
I mean the present economic crisis uh is a very good example			
And he has also pointed out that the idealism which Gandhiji and			
Nehruji had the spirit with which they had fought for freedom and the			
spirit with which they looked at the future is quite different			
Twenty-five years ago or a little more than that I was in the			
United States I was studying uh I was doing my post doctor			
research at that time 			
And I came to know some of the American professors very intimately			
One of them in the context of the foreign policies of India and			
Pakistan said like Pakistan why do you not co-operate with us			
If India co-operates the America will lay down the red			
carpet for your country 			
At that time I told him very prou proudly			
 We have been under slavery for a long time we do			
not want red carpets we want to be independent we would like to stand on our			
feet clapping twenty-five years later I think 			
we have failed we have asked them to lay down the red carpet and			
we are now willing to walk on that red carpet 			
I do not think this is the proper attitude the proper spirit at			
which we are looking at our problems 			
But I do hope that we will not only change ourselves			
but we will act in our manner when the young generation changes 			
And for that if you want the younger generation to change then			
 they should not look down at us they should look up at us 			
And if they are to look up at us then I think the basic			
requirement is that when we go into our classrooms we are fully equipped for			
the next fifty minutes' or sixty minutes' lecture 			
We know our subject thoroughly well wer are able to enthuse			
the student we are able to draw from them certain amount of			
information and we are able to make them to interact with us in the			
search for knowledge 			
This is the spirit behind the Academic Staff College 			
All of you have been enthusiastic enough to register for uh 			
this course 			
I am sure that during the next three weeks you will be provided			
with a lot of information 			
My only hope is that you will take this information you will			
imbibe whatever is given to you 			
You will see that mentally what has come together it is			
co-ordinated and a new flow of knowledge emerges 			
And this flow of our knowledge these new thoughts are not			
confined to us to our colleagues but they go down to our			
students 			
It is our duty and I think all of us here realize this 			
and all of us are willing to do our job 			
 I must before I conclude I must again thank Dr			
Dubhashi for coming here I must thank uh him for allowing the			
Academic Staff College of Goa University to hold its orientation programme			
here			
And I am sure that with the fare Dr Devasthali has put out for			
you the next three years would be next three weeks would be 			
not only very invigorating but will be a very happy 			
vacation or so called vacation period for you 			
Thank you all clapping 			
I prepared it just uh in case we need to refer to			
something common which we have in our hand 			
Uh and I'll keep the tone of this talk uh quite			
informal 			
So in case you want to sort of place some questions 			
uhm it's better to postpone them till the end of the talk			
But uh in case you feel that uh you have a very strong			
impulse to ask something you can stop me you know and you know sort of			
uh there is no problem 			
Well I've termed this the the title of this as 			
 Language in Poetry 			
 It's very uh very often we talk of language of			
poetry or the poetic language 			
And uh I think there are two ways of looking at it 			
One is the what we call the classical traditional 			
approach to poetic language 			
That there is a special specially marked group of			
words which are highly poetic in nature the classical and the			
neo- classical way of writing poems 			
Uh this is exemplified in my first example the notion			
of poetic diction 			
Uh you must have heard of Banabhatt the seventh century			
 Sanskrit writer the writer of the piece called			
 Kadambari the first formal narrative uh			
very elaborate narrative in Sanskrit in prose 			
The supreme example of classical prose style cough			
 in Sanskrit 			
 It's also the supreme example of what an ornamental style			
is like ornamental prose style 			
And it is said what I want to illustrate uh to this is 			
you see this work was incomplete there is a myth about uh this			
work called Kadambari 			
The work was incomplete when he was about to die 			
He called to one of his shisyas and also			
 his son was there 			
Uh just to test who would who who would be able to			
complete the work in case he is not able to complete and then 			
And he you know he pointed to a withered tree and uh 			
asked what is it ?			
And I have given the two responses one of Bana's 			
disciple who said shusko vrikshaha tishthati agre agre			
 in front of us agre shuskai dried up			
withered vriksha is tree tishathati 			
is standing 			
Now Bana asked his son what about you what is that ?			
And he said neeras taruhu iha vilasati puratha			
purataha is again uh uh that's almost the same as			
 agre 			
Okay but uh it is more poetic to say 			
purataha than to say agre 			
It highly prosaic to say agre vilasati 			
 instead of tishathati uh you have heard of the			
word vilas where you can you know vilasati			
 in that sense taruhu instead of 			
vrikshaha iha is uh neeras instead of			
 shuska it is neeras 			
So these are some of the dimension of a poetic 			
diction 			
Modern poets and modern critic uh particularly post nineteenth			
century post symbolist don't believe in this approach at all 			
In fact modern poetry has revolted against this kind of thing			
in fact 			
The the revolt began with in the West with the			
nineteenth century romantic poets 			
Wordsworth wanted to write the language of men okay			
The the common commonly used language not the specially			
used specially concocted poetical diction or poetic diction 			
But what it it uh does perhaps this kind of an			
approach is to draw your attention to draw our attention to the			
element of choice involved in all poetry 			
The element of choice in diction that is in vocabulary 			
element of choice involved in structures their arrangements choice of			
metre or non-metre everything is a matter of choice and it is a choice			
 in language			
And that is why I say It is language in poetry 			
You have to uh uh poetry happens in language 			
See again the traditional view that language is the dress			
 is the ornament for content is the soul is quite misleading 			
Even without taking the extreme organical stand that you know 			
language and thought language and content are organically related			
Even without going into that kind of an extreme position we can			
still say that poetry is something which happens in language cough			
 which emerges out of language you can't think of poetry without			
thinking of language 			
You can't say that poetry uh somehow exist somewhere outside			
language 			
This language which limits it as Wilkin Cine had said 			
uh the limits of our language are the limits of our experience 			
In that sense the limits of our language are the limits of uh			
poetry which get written in that language in a sense 			
But it is only uh metaphor I am using because those limits are			
extendable those limits are in fact being uhm uh changed and shifted			
 by the poets themselves okay			
So this is uh my first point uh that it there is 			
we need not think in terms of false dichotomies like language Vs			
literature most students and teachers of literature are uh tend to			
look at it in uh in that particular fashion			
Language Vs literature I think it's a it's 			
absolutely a false dichotomy this is it's a false opposition 			
popularized by those who were uh well who who don't want to make the			
necessary effort to you know uh uhm look at the language of			
poetry carefully 			
Uh so one of the most fascinating aspects of reading and			
studying literature and poetry to explore its relation to language 			
Now what I want to now look at is see in the			
twentieth century the Swiss linguist Ferdinand Sassuare first			
 gave us this particular notion that language is a system of			
sign			
The first semiotic motion okay which has shaken			
the intellectual world which has shaped it in a new way many many			
different disciplines including anthropology including sociology			
including psychology structuralism and semiotics have played 			
a crucial role in literature in language certainly 			
Now what is it mean to say that language is a system of signs what			
are the implications of this okay 			
 It's a semiot to to give language as a semiotic system 			
Uh let me tell you that Sassuare though he was the first			
twentieth century linguist in the West to look at language in this			
particular fashion language as a system bu and emphasis			
the systemic systemic aspect of language 			
Uh this approach in classical times uh goes back			
to say Panini okay 			
The whole theory of Sanskrit grammar which Panini developed			
 has it has been called structuralist it has been called generative			
Now apart from those terms I am not going to elaborate			
those terms but certainly language and its structure have fascinated			
people 			
People have had a lot of theories about it 			
We shall selectively use a part of that theory in order to			
see how what happens to language in poetry 			
Just as we see what happens how poetry happens in language			
I want to see how what happens to language in poetry 			
And this can be seen at four levels four basic levels of			
linguistic structuring which linguists have identified 			
Language for a linguist is essentially spoken 			
So it is cough phonological as they call 			
phonological			
Phonology is the study of the systems of sounds 			
Languages select certain sounds arbitraly and start			
 organizing them in certain systematic way 			
There are infinite number of sounds which a human vocal			
organism can produce in itself as you can see from a child babling 			
All kinds of sounds are produced 			
But certain sounds are identified as functionally relevant sounds			
 and are structured 			
So this is called the phonological level of structuring 			
linguistic structure 			
These sounds come together to form certain level of higher			
abstractions that is you can have a syllable and you can have			
certain clusters of consonants certain clusters of vowels			
So vowels consonants and higher levels of organizations			
into syllables 			
This is one level 			
Further you develop into the level of word word which			
is called morphology word and formation of words 			
A still higher level of organization by higher I mean 			
larger and larger units of organization is the syntactic level 			
And through syntax you communicate meaning the meanings			
are also structured in language			
So Sassuare was trying to explore the nature of the linguistic			
sign which on the one hand relates certain sounds to certain			
words uh to certain meanings 			
So sounds on the one hand meanings on the other what Sassuare			
called a relation between the signifier and the signified the			
sounds and images sounds and meanings etcetera			
And these four levels of structuring what Sassuare developed			
 and what modern linguistics has developed is a certain way of			
describing the structure of a language 			
Describing the norm which governs language behaviour ordinary			
 linguistic behaviour ordinary speech behaviour 			
What are the rules ?			
Okay 			
This is what lead us to 			
Now obviously when you have a rule there is also a			
possibility of breaking that rule of deviating from the rule 			
And to begin with I would say that poetry is some kind of			
a purposeful deviation from the norm of usage from the normal usage			
you deviate purposefully 			
Now I don't want to bring in problems of intentionality and so on			
 on the poe on the part of the poet			
I don't want to go into the poet's psychy to ask the			
questions what did this poet actually mean when when he wrote this 			
For me it is enough if we can reconstruct some kind of a poet			
within the poem 			
 That's enough for me I don't have to go and verify			
from the poet did you mean really this or something else 			
 That's not that's not my approach 			
that's may be a relevant approach for a psycho-analyst for a			
biographer but not for say a literary critic 			
A literary critic would be interested in the text how text			
 uh become in the texuality of the text okay 			
How these text makes construct meaning with			
the help of whatever norm if that is available with the help of one			
word 			
So that's why I put in norm and deviation 			
 I'll come to examples a little later 			
Let me go on to the third point in my synopsis 			
Modern linguistics has not stop at the consideration of			
 structure of language 			
It has also to say something about the functions of language			
 particularly uh the European school of analysis			
See the after Sassuare Sassuare was a Swiss linguist 			
writing in French around nineteen hundred and twelve he delivered			
between nineteen nine and nineteen twelve he delivered a series of			
lectures which have now come to the uh come to be recognized as			
revolutionary lectures in the form of a course 			
They were published as a book uh Sassuare never intended			
to write it as a book but uh lecture notes were uh expanded and			
published in the form of a book Course in General Linguistics			
 by students and it has shaped our notions of language 			
Uh though Sassuare didn't write anything about literature his			
views of language have been same as very crucial in our dealing with 			
poetic language 			
One at the structural level the American linguist took			
over took took off from that point and developed theories of			
structure 			
One whole school came into being called American structuralism lead			
by Leonard Brumfield uh culminated in the work of Charles Hawkins			
After that there was again a a reaction against that and			
 uh from M I T Chomsky has been developing his theory of Generative			
Grammar nineteen fifty-seven onwards 			
So this has been the line of printing the generative grammar			
the structuralist grammar in the field of description of linguistic			
structure 			
The other line was followed by the European linguists 			
particularly linguists of the France school 			
And there is one linguist who who has remained the link			
between language literature European tradition American tradition and			
has sort of you know uh has been able to combine the various uh			
traditions in the western world and something which can be called a western			
tradition of linguistics uh symbolized by Roman Jocobson the work of			
Roman Jacobson 			
Uh who was part of the Russian formalists part of the			
France school part of the uh American scene after the sixties 			
And the functions that I have enumerated uh have been			
proposed by Jacobson very simply 			
Again there is a specially poetic function which he			
identified but these are not functions which are mutually exclusive 			
every speech act for the linguists of France school for Roman			
Jacobson has six different directions 			
It can have these potentially it has the six different elements			
and these six different directions 			
They are sort of orientations of the speech act 			
One is you can you can say I am very unhappy			
 			
This is self-expression 			
The speaker is attracting attention to himself or herself and			
trying to tell people what is happening to him or her 			
This is called the expressive function of language			
Please notice that unlike the romantic or the expressive			
theories in the West Jacobson does not equate this kind of			
self-expression with the poetic language 			
Language of poetry is not language of self- expression 			
Second you can orient it to the receiver of your message 			
in a poetic act you can say please open the door 			
I am not expressing my feelings about it I am simply 			
persuading you requesting you trying to influence you to do something 			
This can be called connotive or uh emotive persuasive 			
use of language 			
This is an orientation and please notice that poetry can			
be expressive but that is not its central function			
Poetry can be emotive persuasive for example take			
patriotic poetry can be vey highly emotive and persuasive but that's			
 not its function according to Jacobson 			
The third is I can straight refer to the environment because there			
is a context to our entire uh speech act 			
And I can say well uh It's rather hot today			
 which serves to refer to an internal or external factor			
in the communicative act			
This can be called a referential function of language			
 I'll describe it 			
Referring to something specific in the environment in the			
context of the speech act this is called the uh referential			
function or the des descriptive function			
of language 			
This also is part of literary language part of poetic language			
descriptive poetry 			
For example in novels you get a lot of descriptions you can			
 you have evocative language you have you have expressive			
language and so on okay 			
Doctor Agarwal and my and professor Pandya and my friends			
 it is my previlege to be with you and uh whatever doctor			
Agarwal has said it is exaggerating it uh form or thing 			
I do not have those qualifications which he has narrated just now			
Only thing is that uh I have been throughout a teacher			
 and a very long career of a teacher 			
Earlier I was in uh Rajghat Baseti school a			
foundation for new education society run by doctor J Krishnamurthy 			
Foundation 			
And uh then I heard him in fact I had no intention to			
become a teacher but after hearing several lectures of doctor Krishnamurthy			
 which was which had changed brought a change in my			
attitudes in life 			
I have not become disciple of anybody so far but most of these			
philosophers had been uh having some or the other impact on me 			
And I remember Krishnamurthy as saying that when you want to			
create something new you have to start afresh you can't uh begin			
with the middle 			
And if you do it you will simply improve upon it you cannot 			
create something new 			
Well I do not know how to start afresh because wherever I have gone			
I had got an established institution of course my studies I have			
started afresh and of course there I have been able to create a new			
discipline in the Botany department of Banaras Hindu University 			
discipline of micro- ecology in which some twenty-five research scholars			
have got doctorate and a couple of them are registered 			
Straight away I joined this college uh uh soon after passing			
my university and uh I am not that smart to run here and there			
 for a better job 			
Whatever I got I wanted to make it better most suitable for me			
And here the people are so wise and intelligent that they			
moulded me into a science educationist and being a botanist and			
then a science educationist and then environmentologist and then			
ecologist and so many ist were added to my name and then ultimately I			
became a expert in uh out of science school science activity			
 and UNESCO accepted me as expert and resource person and sent me to			
work two three places along with an Australian resource person and a			
Canadian resource person 			
So the credit goes to our my great country which has a variety			
of states and very intelligent people we are 			
I can tell you because I have seen many people and I have			
studied in United States of America also and I find that their entire			
life and thinking process is just mechanical whereas our thinking			
process is radical and rather more philosophical 			
That is why we think very high but when we achieve little we			
get frustrated unnecessarily because this is just because when you			
think high and get little bit less you get frustrated nothing else 			
We are no way inferior to any nation in the world 			
And I am very sure and very hopeful that India will emerge			
 as one of the strongest and well built nation uh by the year two			
thousand is over 			
And uh regarding this particular programme I have only one			
thing to say that if India has to sustain as a great nation it			
will have to show the greatness which is required for a nation as			
well as for individuals 			
And the greatness in Indian philosophy is dhairya			
 that is patience 			
You have to listen to others with great patience tolerate his			
views vidya education another aspect 			
 Dhairya vidya and then bravery you are			
coming from Shivaji's place who was the I think bravest			
person in our country ever born 			
And of course patriotism is there 			
Now this is all regarding that dhairya business			
 whatever we are going to do because tolerance comes when you 			
tolerate others 			
There may be hundred and thousand views about presenting a			
particular question or pasen presenting a			
particular question a subject in the text 			
Say for example when somebody asks me what is the culture of India			
 ?			
Which they said they say sanskriti 			
From which period we should count the history of India from			
Vedic period Aryan period or the Medieval period or post			
Independence period ?			
The that India which was existing in Vedic period is			
no more that India existing 			
The India of Medieval ages have also gone 			
And India born in nineteen forty-seven is the real deadline 			
from which we should think ahead and think about building a strong			
nation			
Whatever is there it is we cannot call it partition India 			
in fact that much part of India was made free and made available to us			
 to live in and to work 			
The government of India is uh very much worried about certain			
aspects of national integration 			
And also atrocities on women uh either in the written form			
or verbal or gestural or what sort what may be the gists 			
Say for example if somebody quotes a particualr religion			
 or a text of a religion others get hurt 			
Now why should we do it ?			
If he is if if my words are hurting somebody we should			
avoid speaking those words avoid writing those words avoid seeking questions			
like that 			
So if if you want to maintain this secular infrastructure			
of this country we have to be very cautious in dealing with variety			
of people 			
And accordingly this committee has been set up to scrutinize			
 the question papers of Maharashtra and Gujarat to see if there are			
some anamolies and also to suggest methods of avoiding those			
anamolies 			
Recently we received a letter from the council they they also			
want the original question papers which you will be scrutinizing so we			
will be dispatching this whole bunch to the headquarters also 			
So that India remains as India 			
India remains as a secular India 			
And uh nobody should have any sort of grievance that this was			
done therefore this has been this has happened 			
So to build up a real strong national character this step			
is essential 			
We have al already analysed the			
textbooks of various languages and various states on several aspects			
like uh bias uh religious bias or political bias or the 			
atrocities on women folk and bias also			
I remember one instance in a textbook it was cited that			
Ram asked Sita to go and fetch a bucketful of water from the well			
The objection was raised why Seeta should go to fetch water			
 why not Ram should go laughter 			
Uh the male dominance is not liked 			
Of course we should do away with that 			
Too much dominance of female is also not good 			
It happens in our homes laughter 			
So we do away with that and you do away with this 			
laughter to make our li life 			
happier 			
So all sorts of things are there and there is no end to it also			
Don't think that this will be the final 			
You may be again invited another team may come to do further uh			
 screening of the question paper 			
Because if somebody wants to be hurt he need not even 			
read your text he may just simply see your face and get hurt 			
laughter 			
What we see that uh some people say that I am allergic to that			
gentleman whenever I see him laughter I get annoyed			
 It's alright you have every right to be annoyed 			
That is what happens in the college also 			
Wherever there is a society of human beings some people you			
will always find annoyed annoyed unnecessarily no reason behind			
it but simply they are annoyed that's all 			
And you can't do anything 			
Similarly here also you see only that the religious questions			
and the questions regarding to a particular religion are not there and if			
they are there how they can be moulded to keep the uh views of			
the people in their desirable limit or you can say that this it			
should not be feeling should not be hurt 			
Now as a teacher I find that our role is the most difficult role			
which the society has given to us 			
We have made it easier by simply visiting the class and 			
telling whatever little you know to the students and then thinking that			
your job is over 			
But if you work very hard to achieve your goal you will find that			
your life span is very little 			
I feel that at the fag end of my career say only five or six			
years are left I feel that I have been able to achieve very little in			
this and a lot of things are to be done 			
And I wish that I live for another hundred years to see			
 a real good teacher being produced it's very difficult			
When I see the plight of our young people when I see the			
unemployment when I see the students struggling here for nothing 			
and uhn others other such cases also I intend 			
And in this college also I am only doing my routine duty 			
Routine duties are so heavy that you cannot just do the other			
things 			
So my pound of wisdom is almost going to dry 			
To keep myself fresh I still continuing continue			
 taking a couple of classes so that that compels me to learn			
 and to go to the class 			
Otherwise this college or any other college they are all true			
reflection of whatever society we have 			
Now when anything goes wrong the teachers are caught and blamed			
So as a community I am warning you especially there is			
nothing to warn to people of Maharashtra and Goa they are wonderful 			
in our region 			
When I make a comparison only last week on Wednesday I was			
at Ahmedabad uh talking to the chief executives of education			
department with chief secretary and education secretary and directors			
of education and boards and all these people sitting 			
I said If you ask me to compare between the			
different between different states of the region I will say 			
Goa and Maharashtra are the best because the people are there			
sincere they want to work they want to work hard 			
And then comes Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat is the last			
state 			
And you must take care of this thing why Gujarat is lagging			
behind ?			
Why your teachers are not coming forward ?			
If we invite fifty teachers from Gujarat five come 			
Fifty-five are forty-five are absent without reason 			
Then one of them remarked that it is because they are all			
doing tuitions 			
So that is you to that is you to go into it 			
And this is this condition so they said that I will send			
 one person top officer at Regional College of Education Bhopal 			
He will be visiting us very shortly to find out the problems			
of Gujarati students students of Gujarat state 			
That how is it there problems are genuine they do not			
know any language other than Gujarati 			
They don't neither follow English nor Hindi and we don't			
know Gujarati at all 			
So how can we communicate with them so they are sitting in the			
classroom with open mouth and blank faces 			
So I said You introduce English in Gujarat state also			
like other states because English is going to stay in our country 			
It is such a language which cannot simply be thrown out by			
even order 			
Hindi will replace English in some hundred years 			
It is not a matter of say a decade or two 			
So he is coming to study the whole thing and then he will make a			
report and submit it to the Gujarat government 			
So teachers' job is a very difficult job I tell you 			
And more you get bobbed down into it more you will be in			
trouble 			
But you should be a real teacher not just an orator of			
your subject 			
And for that you have to have a very deep understanding 			
your of your subject 			
You know we are all using our faculty upto cognitive domain only			
And there only upto recall and memory type of thing that			
is knowledge 			
And in knowledge when knowledge enters you develop			
understanding 			
We have done away with understanding part 			
And when you achieve understanding then you develop			
application of knowledge and skill 			
That is why Indians are more philosophical than more			
skilled people 			
So these things we have to inculcul 			
inculcate among the students 			
Your job is very simple one 			
And I think such a galaxy of stars will be able to complete			
it within a day or two or three not more than that 			
And I will request doctor Agarwal the moment you complete your			
work you may be free to go to your places because we want uh 			
 we want only a report on the analysis of question paper 			
So I have to attend another meeting at four so I take leave			
from you people thanking you very much to have come to come 			
over here and to do this particular type of job which not 			
which may not be to your taste I am sure 			
But still we have to do with them			
Thank you very much clapping 			
Hello you know his importance I deserve as a			
direct student of Gujral and the influence is very much there 			
That is why it has that philosophical basis 			
And uhm if you do not understand phenomenology lot of			
modern critical theory will not be understood because you know they			
based their idea on phenomenology 			
The idea of subjectivity we all these days we talk			
about subjectivity and phenomenology emphasises subjectivity			
You know how the subject is constituted interesting 			
idea and as a feminist literature feminist theory you			
always come across the idea of subjectivity how the subject is			
constituted 			
Woman as a subject how it is constituted 			
Uhm it is a cultural construction it's not a			
biological construction like someone who would say the woman was			
not born she was made 			
I am not a bo I am not a born woman I was made a woman 			
So the idea of subjectivity is not a very simple idea it's 			
very you know the historical construction of the idea of the			
subjectivity and phenomenology emphasise the idea of subjectivity			
And subsequently it became a problematical idea that uh 			
the notion of the subject the constitution of the subject how the			
subject is constituted is not an easy thing to say you know 			
it's not something that is result uh taken for granted 			
And the relationship between the subject and the object who is			
the subject who is the object ?			
Uh sometimes you feel that the object perhaps is the subject			
you know so subject object axis is very complex and			
phenomenology I repeat it emphasise that notion of subjectivity			
 that's why it is called subjective criticism 			
Whose subjectivity you can ask ?			
The readers the writers there is also narrator involved			
in the process of narrative the all subjects the			
reader is a subject the writer is a subject the character who			
narrates is a subject 			
So whose subjectivity and how one subjectivity is imbricated			
with another you know these are all complex say philosophical			
problems particularly when you deal with the narrativity you come			
across these kind of interesting uh I would say that colonical 			
of very interesting notions about subjectivity 			
And that's why you know subjectivity			
Objectivity is a very is a false notion according			
to these there is nothing called objectivity you cannot be objective			
 objective 			
You assume that the whole world can be reduced into some kind of			
 immense neutrality which is a kind of objectivity 			
Is it possible to do that ?			
The world also as a subject is constituted by your			
consciousness if individual response to the world in his own particular			
way where to get the sense of objectivity			
How is it that you want to be objective ?			
What is the basis of objectivity ?			
And who actually makes the basis ?			
The very fact that you define objectivity you are already 			
implicated into the very definition which is your personal			
definition 			
That is why it's a very very false notion the idea of			
objectivity there is nothing called objectivity 			
One is relatively uh you can say uh relatively know			
like subjectivity and objectivity or subjectivity refers to the subject			
objectivity refers to the object 			
And the does the object exist independently of your			
consciousness ?			
How does the object get a realised do you 			
perceive a thing all of you in a same way 			
When you come into the room your eyes you know glances at			
something not the entire thing and the same eye of another person			
doesn't glance at the same thing 			
So there is all like all I say you the sense of perception 			
had already reduced things into some kind of selectional it has already			
selected which thing to see and which thing to exclude from vision			
from perception 			
So the act of perception itself is a selective art and when			
the process of selection has already taken place in in a mental uh			
you know when when it is in a mental process that the idea of			
objectivity is lost			
You don't see the whole world together at a time 			
You see piecemeal and it comes to you through fragments 			
And the very fact that you will be selective uh whether you			
like it or not you are selective in your glance in your vision that			
actually negates the very idea of objectivity 			
How do you then make sense of the world ?			
If the world is such a vast thing which you can't see at a			
time everything how do you then make sense of the world ?			
Can you really objectively say that the world is like this ?			
You know so these are all illusions and uh western			
philosophers particularly created the notion of objectivity as an			
idea it's a kind of platonic fallacy you can say something 			
exterior exists and we intuitively realise it's sense it and			
the very idea of intuition perhaps negates the idea of objectivity that			
you have some intui intuition in			
your think in your perception that negates the idea of subjectivity 			
uh objectivity			
So phenomenology says that objectivity is nothing it's			
 just an illusion and everything perception is personal subjective			
You see things the way you want to see them sometimes you			
refuse to see 			
Deliberately you do not like to see things because you don't			
like to see them 			
But your vision is always selective in its own way it			
always selects things from a mass of events mass of things that you			
 uh are scattered around you you select a few because			
perhaps in a very i i interesting 			
 way logical way become some to your uh thinking 			
So you select something that confirms to your line of thinking			
and so on and so forth 			
So basically any kind of response is a subjective response			
That is a case which phenomenology makes 			
You read a text you like it or you don't like it yes 			
Sir phenomenology is the operate experience at			
subjective level			
Yes			
But uh at its various uh student criticism like			
uh as you referred to rather the guidance of these landmarks feminist			
criticism or even black literature and so forth and so on cough 			
there since phenolism phenomenology applies to a sort of group			
volunteers			
Yes it is a group concept I think			
So how this various or even the idea of new colonisation			
example literary criticism or literary creation so all this			
interpretation are can be traced back to the idea of phenomenology			
only in a way 			
You can do that you can say that 			
If there is some if there is a kind of group response and			
the collective response to something like you have mentioned the			
feminists or the blacks there have been			
From the third world			
Any way cough but if there are variations if			
you look at the individual but there is something called and I that			
is why I say that and it varies from group to group it varies from			
person to person and within group there are lot of divergences and you			
can take note of that 			
If we account for all those divergences within the			
commonality which is a kind of one word imposed upon those			
desperate tendencies in individual perception			
In fact every individuals movements breaks down before it			
 takes off 			
 Naturally naturally			
Nature of the very idea of phenomenology			
Naturally so it is the very basis of human perception			
 you			
 A few words they were talking about their			
Commonwealth now they say			
Yeah about these this whole idea but you know			
commonwealth of course is a very hetrogeneous concept			
There is no Commonwealth response			
 A few words 			
Yes			
You can say there may be a third world reference			
 But they didn't 			
But they didn't talked about it to start with			
See they talked about it but you see how can you then say			
the Australian response is similar to Indian response or the Canadian			
response Commonwealth within Commonwealth if they belong to the first			
world			
But still they didn't talked about it			
See this is as I say it is a desperate ideas yoked in			
violence you know it's kind of hetrogenity and that also is a			
very debatable idea 			
Is there any communality of this kind of political term which			
unites the erstwhile colonies but the response of a			
Canadian response certainly is closer to the American response than uh uh			
an Indian response			
And you can't uh uh say that a first world country like Canada			
 uh response this in the same way as a third world country			
So there is a lot of variations but uh phenomenology doesn't			
talk of course of a group response kind of thing			
They talk of individual and they don't really like the idea of			
this collective response is like collective action and if they name			
it some we will talk about that later on a slightly when we talk about to			
reader response criticism 			
But the collective response idea also is self contradictory			
Response cannot be collective because two people two persons			
do not think alike 			
And you group them together and say you think alike and you			
can't control human thinking it is so spontaneous 			
Your own response is so spontaneous you can only politically			
manipulate the whole thinking process even to suit your convenience			
It is a political manipulation of human mind can be controlled			
technologically you know but human response certainly tries to			
evade this kind of technologing of the spirit 			
Spirit could not be technologised in way you want them want it			
to be technologised but you can't even say you can't say there			
is nothing called collective response 			
Blacks certainly think in their own way there is communality of			
interest 			
There is certainly when it comes to the the question of			
white domination they certainly respond in very general way about			
the notion of domination ideology power and so on and so forth and that			
is the kind of			
But it is not perception these people deal with more intensely deal			
more intensely with how you percieve things how things get realised			
in your consciousness get realised in your perception how things take			
shape in your mind so it is the the the kind of ideatic according to			
Ferrel you refer you induce it to some kind of ideatic 			
ideatic reflection or ideatic uh uh reduction ideatic reduction or			
reflection idea if now reduced to that level of perception 			
perceptual you know 			
And a concept arises out of the innate perceptuality of			
her idea so that innate perception you perceive then you			
conceptualise			
First is perceive you perceive in your mental eye and			
that perceptuality of every ob the object gets realised 			
through your perceptuality your perception 			
There is no object until you see it in your mental eyes			
 It's not just a visual perception but is a very uh as			
you know is a very is a mental perception 			
You perceive the object and suddenly the object take shape in			
your mind then you conceptualise about it			
Conceptualisation is a cerebral process that takes place			
only after the mental perception takes place has taken			
place 			
This is the way all visible objects are reduced to modes			
 by which you perceive an inner reality 			
As I say that it has some complicity with the plutonic idea of			
essence that the whole world is reduced to the object in a very			
miniature way			
In a miniature way the the visible world that you see is a			
miniature copy of the idea the essence which has occured it has			
that kind of traditional plutonic kind of notions of the visible and			
the invisible axis 			
What you see visible is only a manifestation of the invisible			
perception 			
The mind works in its own way and makes things possible			
So the object gets realised to a mental process and then it			
becomes manifested through the phenomenology of the object which is a			
manifestation is possible because of the mental perception 			
This is the idea of the ideatic reduction bracketing 			
everything is bracketed between you and the others			
So you operate at a very higher level of uh uhm 			
relationship between the object 			
So the objectivity is not uh nothing is objective per se 			
there is nothing called objectivity per se you know 			
Objectivity is a realisation of the higher mode of			
subjectivity 			
Objectivity the id object objectivity is the			
whole idea the objectiveness objectivity the object uh the			
objectiveness the object the objectness objectivity is objectness			
So the objectness which you call objectivity the very			
quality of the object is manifested through your subjective perception			
That is why where do you get the idea of objectivity 			
uh without you know some subjectivity 			
Subjectivity makes the objectness possible objectivity is			
possible 			
So the object and subject come together in a very mystical			
way and that is why consciousness is the consciousness of an object			
You cannot have subjectivity without objectivity 			
You cannot have objectivity without subjectivity 			
This is the subject object relationship and uh the whole			
world the whole perception of the perceptual world is possible			
 because of this axis because of this relationship between the subject			
and the object 			
Am I clear on this ?			
Okay this is the basis of phenomenology and as you know			
 as you know already rightly pointed out that this is the fundamental			
 uh way by which you realise the object that you see around you			
The world comes becomes visible because of the mental 			
already mental process which was on and you create the object in			
your own perception 			
In English studies there is unit module two			
 unit two point two point three teaching literature in English			
 what are the approaches to the teaching of literature in English ?			
What are the emergent areas in literature in English ?			
What are the research possibilities ?			
So a a and also uh 			
module three you have uh no I am sorry uh two point three 			
module three research areas in English studies what are the new critical			
tools evolved by the more recent critical method schools ?			
What are the trends in contemporary criticism ?			
What are the new approaches to research in linguistics stylistic			
etcetera ?			
So it is hoped that some of the things that I speak to you			
about will inspire one or two to go along these lines 			
Of the two lectures first uh on auchitya			
 as a cri criterion of 			
literary assessment 			
Yesterday I distributed a handout listing the eight			
major theories not the minor ones eight major theories 			
And the first of these which is the most notorious 			
rasa theory we discussed yesterday 			
Today I am taking up what is listed there as number four 			
 auchitya 			
I have a for distribution a bibliography a select			
bibliography of books and articles on the application of Indian literary			
theory classical Indian literary theory to uh litera 			
 literary works especially uh to modern writings			
 uh which are available in English 			
So you will get a list and uh you can you can choose I			
won't be commenting on that list today but I shall like to comment			
on this yesterday we didn't have the black board today we have			
something which is not quite so black but we'll be able to use			
that clearing the throat 			
The BB writing these diagram I mention briefly 			
which is like uh teaching science in the in some of the old colleges 			
Imagine this is a test tube because in the laboratory they			
didn't have a real test tube so everything was the work of			
imagination 			
But today I think I will draw the diagram which is provided by			
 Kuppuswamy Shastri as I mentioned yesterday and uh that two			
triangles and two circle indicate the relative importance of			
the eight fold system 			
Uh there are some college who would prefer one theory to			
the other theory but I I have a attitude that each theory has its			
own specific application 			
No single theory not even from the west will explain the			
whole of the literary process 			
And the relevance of the theory depends on how liberally 			
how critically how meaningfully we apply this theory 			
What can a poor theory do if the user of the theory is not 			
imaginative enough to apply it intelligently 			
So we have the three major theories dhwani 			
rasa and anumana or anumiti 			
anumiti waad or anumanaya inference 			
These three are linked together by auchitya			
 			
That is without auchitya neither 			
dhwani nor rasa nor anumiti			
 by itself can deliver the goods 			
Everything has to be used in a proper way that applies to			
the application of any literary theory as well 			
The blind application of any theory will not help us in			
appreciating or understanding or interpreting literature 			
The smaller triangle guna a guna			
 theory the alankara theory and 			
riti theory these are of different schools 			
And I have given the names of the people major critics who			
have advocated this with the basic texts 			
And linking guna alankara and riti			
 we have the uh smaller circle which will represent			
 vakrokti 			
For most of these translations are available in English but as I			
said translations were made by Sanskrit scholars who knew their			
kind of English and therefore uh the translations may not satisfy			
the requirements of teachers of English 			
But it is good if teachers of English can take kindly to some			
of these tools of research and develop them in the complete			
confidence that we are free to interpret any theory we handle and we			
ought to do that not merely borrow them wholesale 			
So unless you breathe new life into these these are not going to			
help us 			
We have to deal with modern literature we have to deal with			
literature written in a foreign language 			
And uh we have the gap of thousands of years atleast two			
thousand years perhaps 			
So we have to take these into account and uhm what we get from			
these texts is only the insights 			
Some evidence of efforts made by a people so long ago			
 to understand the literary process which which in fact defies			
understanding 			
No poet no musician will explain to us everything about			
his own art 			
Musicians are most tongue tied in this you know you sit and listen			
to me I won't talk 			
It is a musicologist who will talk about it and he can do that			
because his mastery is comparatively limited 			
There are many things which cannot be uh talked about 			
which cannot be diverged which cannot be even apprehended by the performers			
So ther there is an element of			
mystery and we have eight different ways of probing into the mysteries of			
literary creativity 			
We will take up this auchitya theory			
today and uhm I will try to apply it to Sophocles			
Edipus Rex Edipus the king a Greek play which is cutting			
across uh not only time but also space not because the Greeks			
had come here at the time of the Chanakya serial but because 			
uh there is a common ground 			
The humanist outlook says that there must be certain			
common grounds but you have to dig deep may not be on the surface 			
At the appropriate level you will find the connections just as			
we can discover that we are related to the Eskimos in some way if			
we go back far behind in history clearing the throat 			
The whole paper has been written out uhm and you will get			
copies before it appears in some book 			
So I will read it out with some comments here and there 			
Now scholars from the time of Bharata have been conscious of			
this principle of auchitya 			
It was Shemendra of the eleventh century who devoted a whole			
treaties to its discussion and thereby raised it to the level of a			
basic requisite of all successful literary creations 			
Bharata thinks of it as a principle that ensures guna			
 or qualities and eschews or removes blemishes or 			
doshas 			
According to him the Bharata the violation of auchitya			
 of some kind or other might be responsible for any one of the ten			
 identified doshas 			
That doesn't mean that there are only ten blemishes or ten kinds of			
blemishes 			
Ten have been identified because uh you can't uh list			
all possible types of blemishes we categorise 			
That we do in modern times also 			
The concept of auchitya is employed in Bharatas			
prescriptions for the successful staging of plays 			
Although the word auchitya might not have been			
used by him 			
In the same way Bharata then one word Vamana Anandvasna			
 have all recognised the importance of auchitya 			
But it was left to Shemendra as I said the earlier to project			
the view that auchitya is a fundamental principle and			
that all other qualities will fail to have their effect if this principle is			
ignored 			
So rasa without auchitya will			
not work that is called rasa auchitya he list them			
all 			
Shemendra has identified twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects			
or areas in which auchitya can be perceived 			
Now we must remember that these are these texts have come to			
us in a mangled form parts are missing and the works of many			
scholars have totally disappeared they are only remembered as 			
abstract names 			
Uh but what what has been saved or salvaged gives us some idea			
of what can be done with some of these tools 			
These may be brought under five or six broad heads these			
twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects which he has listed under names for			
instance pada vakya prabandha uh I have a list			
of uh these items and their translations 			
I think I'll read the English translations also you			
know the the auchitya at the sentence level is			
called uh vakya auchitya auchitya at the discourse level			
 is called prabandharth auchitya 			
Then we have items under kavya shastra guna			
alankara and rasa that is uh under metaphor			
 kavya shastra and under poetics we have certain items 			
uh like rasa auchitya alankara auchitya guna auchitya so			
 guna by itself will not be a guna if it			
is in the wrong place if it is not used with propriety 			
On the other hand what may be called a dosha 			
by itself may become a guna if it is used with			
 auchitya 			
Yesterday we pointed out that uh jugupsa 			
and uh bibhatsa which we find in uhm uhm Naipaul may			
be considered gunas in his type of work not in somebody			
elses kind of work 			
So there is a kind of uh a justification on the basis of the			
appropriateness of the whole thing to the literary context 			
Under vyakarna which is the major concern of			
these uh scholars we have pada kriya karaga linga			
vachana visheshana upsarga nibhava and kala 			
or uh words level verb level case gender the appropriate			
gender has to be used			
I will in my comment on uhm Sophocles play I will			
comment on some of these 			
Uh the use of number use of adjective the use of preposition			
 the use of article use of tense there should be appropriateness			
in all this grammatical features as well in a perfect work 			
But perfect works are rare and therefore you will be able to 			
identify violations of these auchitya which is called			
 auchitya bhanga 			
Under loktantra Shemendra lists as I said			
yesterday desa kula and vrata or			
place race and conduct 			
And there you can bring in all kinds of sociological criticism			
If it doesn't suit the particular class or race that is			
presented in a work			
For example if the nishada character the			
woodsman character in a play speaks a high level Sanskrit utterance			
you know that will be inappropriate 			
So propriety or appropriateness has to be observed in the			
kind of characters that is presented and that was the idea 			
otherwise it can violate			
So there is a chance for sociological criticism to find			
its way if this is expanded but unfortunately uh it had not been done in			
ancient India 			
Then under the title under the section kavi 			
 or the poet we have a tatva 			
What is vrata vratasan ?			
 Vrata is conduct behavior 			
appropriate behaviour for that man you know			
If a priest is presented as a character I think he has to 			
conduct himself in that way 			
That that's the meaning I give to it you know uh uh I			
think I have every right to use the ancestral property in my own way 			
And uhm when I have the term loktantra and 			
that's kula and vrata I think we			
have to get at them implied meaning 			
Literary criticism is also interpretation of critical theories			
not only critical works I mean creative works 			
Interpretation of critical works also has to be done that is			
what uh Abhinav Gupta did to Anandvardhana when he			
wrote Lochana as a commentary on uh 			
dhavnyaloka it's an explication it's a			
creative expansion of the basic ideas of Anandvardhana			
 which had continued for uh centuries until everything			
seems to have stopped with Jagannath Pandit and Appaya Richir 			
and that is the thread we have to pick up 			
 It's very un palatable to English teachers to try			
to do something which they have not done thirty forty years ago 			
Uh and the Indian language teachers are also very reluctant to			
do this 			
They haven't done this apart from discussing the theory they don't			
 seem to apply this to any modern novel 			
 Premchand's novels could be discussed in the light of			
some of these a total interpretation of Tagore is possible but we			
have failed to do that 			
And uh I am here to pain you by saying that we haven't done			
many of the things and explanation is the British were there and we			
could not do 			
An English teacher need not feel that English is the last vistage			
of colonialism you know 			
Teachers of English are not yet to perpetuate uh western values			
but they can accept everything from the west provided they are			
understood and absorbed into the system in which we operate 			
Then uh tatva satva we have the uh			
 clearing the throat the the principles observed the level			
of consciousness of satva abhipraya or the intention			
 swabhava or character and characterisation which			
 is becomes uh very important substance imagination situation			
thought name in the naming of characters in aashirwad 			
or benediction 			
So in every aspect if you take a play for instance you			
will find examples of all these and a a total interpretation of any			
single play by using all these insights 			
Now some of them may not be applicable to certain works 			
every theory has its built-in limitation and a theory survives			
because of its acceptance of certain limitations 			
If we recognise the limitation we can make use of it 			
And uh if doesn't work throw away the theory and not the			
literary work this is the basic principle 			
A theory may not apply because a theory is a very broad			
generalisation it's only a model 			
And under kavyangas which are not totally listed			
 three have been uh identified patra prameya 			
and sandarbha characterisation or rabatra			
 or patra and prameya or theme			
 and sandarbha or context 			
So uh if a uh good interpreter of this theory can develop			
even as Shemendra discussed this theory in a book one word 			
study in the eleventh century 			
We could elaborate each of these and give it meaning			
because it's a part of a total scheme 			
And if you find any one of these not applicable to a 			
particular work I think you can reject that or ignore it for the time being			
that is how literary criticism is possible 			
Professor Kamath professor Dixit professor Joshi 			
other members of the Vidyaprasarak Mandali members			
of the staff of both the Kannada and the English high school my			
dear students ladies and gentlemen 			
I feel it an honour to have been invited to deliver the			
first Dr Maker endowment lecture 			
I should like to take this opportunity to compliment 			
professor Kamat and his colleagues on the management of this institution			
 to have thought of an activity in which the community around this			
school can participate 			
One of the weaknesses of educational institutions in our			
society has been their failure to forge active links with the			
community outside we have talked about many ideas linking the			
school with the society 			
We have talked of school school complex we have talked of			
school college complex we have also talked of school community complex			
 but very little has been done 			
Although a great deal can be done even within the limited			
resources of the schools and colleges 			
We have not been able to accomplish much in this very important			
 task of forging creative link with the community outside 			
The activities in the school and in colleges are meant for			
the children and the teachers of those institutions 			
But there are very few if any activities in which the			
public can participate and feel one with the school or with the			
college 			
This failure has affected the ability of the educational			
institutions to draw vital sustainance financial and otherwise 			
from the community which is in a position to help the institution in			
diverse ways 			
I am happy therefore to note that the society approached 			
and received positive response from Dr Maker in whose name this			
lecture series is instituted 			
It is an honour for me to be the first speaker and I			
hope that for many many years to come the experts on various subjects			
 connected with education and society because that professor Kamat			
told me is the general topic education and society and under			
the rubbering of this general topic more selected more specific topics			
 will be taken up by experts for exposition in future lectures 			
I have been I have chosen rather not that I have been			
asked to the general topic was suggested to me and I was given the			
option of selecting any particular topic under the general theme of			
education and society 			
And I have chosen to speak on education and development 			
At the very outset one understands that education and			
development is part of a larger question namely what is the			
relationship of education to society ?			
Historically the inter relationship between the two has			
never been universally accepted 			
The traditional view of education has been that it is geared			
 to the specific interest aptitude and needs of the			
individual 			
And education is defined as an activity whose purpose 			
is to promote and develop various aptitudes in the child 			
cultivate active habits in him and develop such skills and values and			
attitudes as would finally result in a well-rounded personality			
development 			
In other words education has most often been looked upon 			
as the principal means of individualist purpose of developmemnt of			
ones own personality 			
It is his aptitude it is his interest it is his need 			
to develop his own personality that have constituted the main focus 			
of education as an activity 			
The question and in my view the more important question 			
what should such a educated individual do or what ought such			
an individual educated individual what ought such an individual			
to do for his society or for his country is seldom raised in the			
field of educational discussion 			
That is supposed to be for each individual to decide 			
We give him a package over a period of ten fifteen or twenty			
years of education cultivate certain attitudes in him cultivate			
certain values in him cultivate an outlook on life in him and then we			
send him out in the wide world 			
Let him decide what he wants to do whether he wants to lead a			
life entirely devoted to personal development or whether he wants to			
be of some use to the community around him and to his own country is a			
decision which the individual is supposed to take 			
Therefore before going into the specific question of the			
role of education in development it may be useful to raise the general			
question whether education is an end in itself or whether there are			
larger societal purposes which education must serve ?			
The question has acquired urgency in modern times because			
education has become one of the key activities in the very process of			
modernisation 			
Relationship between education and society has become the most			
fundamental problem of our age because education has become at once			
 the principal means of preservation as well as of change 			
Traditionally society has looked upon education as a process by			
which to conserve to enrich and to transmit to succeeding			
generation the accumulated knowledge skills beliefs and values			
 on which the society's cohesion and permanence depends			
But in more recent times and especially in the developing world			
 and India belongs to the developing world education has increasingly			
come to be looked upon as one of the most potent instruments of			
development and also of change 			
As professor James Coleman said and I quote 			
once regarded as essentially conservative culture preserving and			
culture transmiting institutions education now tends to be viewed as			
the master determinent of all aspects of growth and change 			
unquote 			
Society has probably changed more in the last thirty years 			
than it did in the preceding three hundred years and this is equally			
true of both the developed world and of the developing world 			
It is this continuous and often profound societal change 			
and the salient role of the education in it that have brought to the fore			
the question concerning the nature of relationship between education and			
society 			
Two major post second world war developments account for this			
new awareness 			
One is the emergent from colonial rule of the countries of Asia			
and Africa whose leaders at once turned to education as an effective			
instrument of modernisation and national development 			
The other is the growing awareness among the industrially			
advanced nations that in the continued emphasis on education lies the			
assurance of their scientific technological and industrial leadership			
 and even hegemony 			
The earlier attitude of treating education as though it			
were a self sufficient and autonomous system functioning in isolation			
of prevailing socio-economic realities was largely abandoned in favour of			
the more positive concept of education as a social sub-system 			
interrelated with and interacting with other sub-systems like the			
economic sub- system or and the political sub-system 			
There are at least three ways in which education has direct			
relevance to society 			
First is the way education produces suitably trained			
persons in required number to man the million institutions through which			
 society lives and grows 			
This I call the leadership function of education 			
Second is the contribution education makes to economic			
development both in terms of skills and attitude 			
Everywhere and particularly in the developing countries the			
belief in some kind of a cause-effect relationship between education and			
long term economic development has become almost an article of faith 			
The rulers of these countries have been relying increasingly			
 on considerations of economic development to justify greater state			
support as well as greater state control of education 			
Underlying this emphasis on economic development is another			
article of faith namely that rapid economic development is the			
minimum indispensable requisite of democratic political development 			
I call this the development function of education 			
The third and equally important role of education relates to			
its socialization including political socialization function 			
What do I mean by socialization function ?			
Socialization refers to that process by which individuals			
acquire values attitudes and feelings towards the social system 			
and towards their distinctive role in the social system 			
Every social system is based upon its own unique value system			
 and seeks to perpetuate itself by creating an app 			
 appropriate ideological support structure through			
shared values and beliefs among members of that society 			
Education is the principal agency for this purpose which begins			
at birth and continues through both formal and non-formal ways all			
through life 			
For example a democratic society seeks to inculcate among its			
members values of freedom tolerance dignity and autonomy of			
the human personality justice and fair play respect for truth and			
belief in human reason and its capacity to solve human problems 			
A democratic society also seeks to encourage a healthy			
scepticism towards authority and power and especially towards all			
forms of dogma and seeks the help of education to achieve these goals			
I just now spoke of the increasing expectations from education			
 in social development in political development as well as economic			
development and I used the word development not merely in			
the in the rather narrow sense of economic development 			
I used the term development in a more comprehensive sense of economic 			
social as well as political 			
As against the nineteenth century liberal view of education 			
there is the other view of education as an agent of change and			
development and it is that view which prevails in India among official			
and non-official circles dealing with educational policy 			
It is argued that India is not yet a free society 			
in a fun in a fundamental sense if by freedom			
we mean something more than political independence 			
The Indian society's hierarchical structure its caste			
system inequitus economic system and its anti-labour intellectual			
culture are formidable barriers to its development as free society			
And education will have to make a major effort to create a more			
egaliterian social order as a means to real freedom 			
Unlike western societies where freedom usually meant freedom from			
the state in India and in other developing countries freedom means			
freedom from want hunger ignorance and disease in the eradication			
of which the state is expected to play a pivotal role 			
In such a situation education for freedom would have a			
far more positive content than is visualised in liberal education concept			
It would need to have two components in its curricular content			
 to enable students to relate their educational experience to their			
immediate social environment by participating creatively in the			
transformation of that environment to desired end 			
The first component would consist of the conserving aspect of			
education and would be dealing with knowledge information beliefs			
 values and attitudes 			
The second would be the participatory component which would			
have both a theoritical and an applied aspect such as work experience 			
or socially useful productive work 			
I do not have to tell an audience of school teacher what a			
mess we have already made of both these useful concept of work experience			
 and socially useful productive work 			
In India education is critically relevant in as much as it			
is a vital element in the process not only of comprehending but also			
managing development and change which are two crucial input in our			
pursuit of a modern nation making 			
Education being a catalystic having a catalystic role it is			
wrong to look upon it as a self-contained neutral and autonomous			
system 			
Rather it needs to be consciously oriented towards the building			
up of India as a nation and towards the realization of our national goals			
 of a rapid economic development in which the standards of living 			
for all people will continually be rising 			
Education is thus a very important element in the process of			
development 			
But let me pause here for a moment and ask the question 			
what sort of development ?			
We all want to develop ourselves 			
There are no two opinions about that 			
And we want to develop as fast as we can 			
No two opinions about that either 			
But what sort of development do we want ?			
Because much will depend upon our clarity in the			
conceptualization of quote unquote development that our curriculum in			
education that our teaching learning and everything else that goes in			
schools and colleges the character of the activities in schools and			
colleges will depend upon the clarity we have and the national consensus			
we are able to build on this central concept of development 			
Until twenty or thirty years ago developing countries like			
India answered the questions what sort of development do you want			
 by saying we want much the same sort of development that			
industrialised countries of the west have achieved 			
In other words we want to imitate England we want to			
imitate the United States we want to imitate Germany Japan Soviet			
Union or France we want to become like the western			
industrialised society whose high standards of living have been made			
possible by a rapid process of industrialization with central emphasis on			
basic industries 			
We want large scale industrialized civilization 			
It is only when we have that kind of process of development			
 based on rapid industrialization of the economy that we shall be			
able to call ourselves modern India a developed India 			
An India in which the citizens are assured of an ever increasing			
standard of life 			
That was the general acceptance of the western model and			
there was a near unanimity on the need to adopt and imitate the western			
models of development 			
But now things are changing 			
Things are changing both in India in other developing			
countries but more importantly things are changing in the industrial			
world the western world itself as they have begun to see that			
the model that was adopted and developed in their own countries is not			
necessarily applicable all over the world 			
Hello uh recap we said that there are atleast			
 two schools of thought when it comes to the scope of economics 			
One is distribution one emphasises allocation 			
Depending on the school of thinking your tools of analysis also			
differs 			
For example when you have distribution as your aim then your			
thinking apparatus will be in this way where surplus is distributed			
between workers and entrepreneurs 			
Whereas when you have allocation as allocation as your aim then your			
tools of analysis are calculus 			
One another distinction 			
When it comes to the question of allocation substitution			
between the two things becomes the central issue 			
Alfred Marshall in his principles of economics if you see			
 the eighth edition which was the last one that is there if he had			
lived upto now he would have made further editions of the same thing 			
It is a very nice book			
People don't read these days that book 			
It is very good 			
For the sheer English language atleast it is worth reading 			
Apart from very perceptive ideas 			
Marshall was a man of tremendous perception 			
Joan Robinson once said that he has a woman's perception			
like that because women are considered to be more perceptive than men 			
laughs 			
Uh so that that that's the way she described him 			
Well if you see in the preface Alfred Marshall says 			
that the chief merit of this book is the application of the principle of			
substitution in every branch of economics because if you don't have that			
substitution you can't have the maximisation thing 			
It is an essential part of it 			
For example if I have a curve like this I can't take a tangent			
It requires that I have a a relationship which has a curvature			
Here here for example it is diminishing this but it is			
diminishing at a constant rate 			
Whatever I give up in pie I get in W U and vice versa 			
Whereas here there is an assumption that there is diminishing			
marginal rate of substitution 			
This is at the heart of micro economics 			
Take away this assumption micro tools are not there 			
But at this point one another thing which is normally not refer			
to in text books let me present to you 			
This assumption of diminishing marginal rate of substitution 			
you know it is an assumption independent of mathematics independent			
of mathematics 			
For example take the most important micro foundation that			
first chapter the students learn 			
That is about utility theory utility maximisation 			
And when the students come to the classroom we tell them that uh			
 that if there are two commodities and if I let us say Q one 			
and Q two are the two commodities 			
And I tell the students you know that utility is a			
function of the consumption of these two commodities 			
Right ?			
And I make an assumption that the more he consume the more he is			
satisfied 			
More is preferred than less 			
And we make an assumption that preferences are transitive 			
though you know that it is if A is bigger than B and B is bigger than C than			
A is bigger than C and not the other way round			
This kind of axioms of choice we teach them because on that			
basis this is the micro foundage you know micro economic is grounded in			
individual behaviour 			
And those individual behaviour we give in the form of axioms of			
choice 			
Right ?			
And on the basis of that we try to derive what is known as an			
indifference curve or a utility function 			
First we say Utility is a function of Q one and Q two			
And in the next page or the next paragraph the text book draws a			
picture like this B B writing 			
They won't explain how come this equation this picture came 			
That is why students find it very difficult to understand 			
And you know sometimes teachers also find it difficult			
And sometimes you know what happens is the students don't ask			
questions luckily otherwise it will be very laughter very			
embarassing for the teacher because from this to this you try your best			
 it is near impossible to get that equation			
I will tell you why 			
That is what we have to learn in refresher programmes 			
Something on the foundation because what happens is you know			
for twenty years some book comes we teach to our students on the twenty-first			
year they say We have changed this book because this is a wrong book			
like that 			
We also start saying the same thing laughter 			
You know in the beginning we didn't ask the question why are we			
reading this book and teaching to our students 			
But before that we try to translate it because we want to have it			
everything in this one			
And in second bo you know it is happening like that as if			
knowledge comes for from there 			
It is true knowledge comes from everywhere 			
But it can also start from here too 			
And there can be an exchange that is possible if we look at			
these things critically 			
And therefore if we find that there is some problem herer 			
error here I'm not suggesting throw this away 			
No no far from it 			
But remembering that such a kind of a thing is there it is			
not something very perfect 			
It is imperfect			
But all knowledge is like that whether it is physics or			
even mathematics or even mathematics uhm			
I will not go drag you into that controversy which is a very			
interesting one			
Let me come back to this 			
I am talking of micro theory now foundations of micro theory			
And in that micro theory takes allocation as the scope of			
economics			
It takes calculus as the tool for analysis 			
It assumes about individuals 			
The major assumption it makes is people are selfish 			
They don't say It like this they say They			
are rational laughs 			
Because if I say People are selfish it looks very			
bad look he is blaming uh being sales kind of people there we write			
 uh people are rational			
And rational means that I can order my preferences and choose the			
best 			
That capability I have like that 			
It presumes numeracy and order 			
That kind of a capability must be there then only I can okay			
It assumes like that and it it has certain a sect of axioms			
about preferences and then we say that utility is a function of			
consumption 			
And then we say Let U bar be the level of utility 			
because unless you have this U bar fixed you don't know where is the first			
point to this graph so you take the first point like that and then			
draw this curve 			
But there is a problem because suppose U bar is equal to			
hundred B B writing right ?			
Then I get some utility by consum 			
consuming Q one let's call it Alpha times Q one so			
much Alpha amount of satisfaction I get by Q one 			
And then that is the Beta amount of satisfaction I get by			
consuming Q two 			
If this total is hundred then if this fifty that must be fifty			
If this is seventy-five that must be twenty-five 			
If this is forty-five that must be know like the it it can't			
be more or less and this hundred can be retained 			
And if you retain that hun don't have that hundred you			
can't draw the curve 			
If you have that hundred then we find you can try it out any			
number of times 			
Then we find that it will be a line like this and not a curvature			
like this 			
But if you don't have a curvature I can't have a tangent 			
If I don't have a tangent I don't have a maxima 			
Therefore I need a tangent			
And if I have to draw this tangent I need to make an assumption 			
and economist at the micro level have assumed diminishing marginal rate of			
substitution 			
It is a contradictory assumption to the givens 			
Naturally the right assumption when you say U bar is			
equal to this and draw the curve it has to be this way 			
But we are drawing it this way for mathematical convenience			
If you take any journal any magazine and start let U be a function			
of something twice differentiable			
We make an assumption 			
Differentiable means drawing of tangent that is finding derivitives			
we say in mathematics but drawing a capa 			
capacity to draw a tangent 			
It is tangent is drawable such a curve is assumed 			
If it was natural there was no need for an assumption 			
We are making an assumption because this is there			
is a contradict			
Has anybody followed this ?			
You can ask me questions about all these things 			
Even in between the lecture also you can stop me and ask			
I will explain any number of times because this is not there			
in books 			
Because striking this out is striking the root of neo-classical			
economics 			
Because if you can't draw this you can't draw an isoquant 			
Same principle is true an isoquant is supposed to give iso			
means equal quant means quantity 			
Isoquant means equal quantity			
If equal quantity is to be there then substitution should have			
been a straight line 			
Because what is happening is here the X axis the Y axis			
 and here is the third axis this is the utility axis actually 			
And this length is fixed that's why U bar 			
And what we have here is a projection of this third axis 			
because it it's a three dimensional picture drawn in a flat way			
It it happens to all the artist when they are painting			
 it's usually three dimensional but it is written on a flat			
surface 			
But your perception your understanding is like that			
So here is a third axis not seen 			
 It's projection and as long as this is fixed and			
straight it this can't be ano anything 			
other than a straight line 			
If this is it because scale has to be straight 			
Therefore and it is fixed and it will be a line like this and			
marginal productivity become in fact that is why many people criticise			
marginal productivity theory 			
On several grounds they criti criticised			
 that 			
The classical school of thinker don't believe in the marginal			
productivity theory as you know because for them the wage fund is given			
 and then the activity of production takes place 			
Whereas for the neo-classical ec 			
economist the production activity takes place with using those			
inputs 			
And then those inputs are used again on the basis of supply and			
demand thing 			
And brings rational producers and consumers 			
They will supply and demand in such a manner that the price they			
offer ge gets them some return 			
And that return is as much as what they contribute to output			
 That's how the marginal productivity theory comes 			
With all its difficulty it has a grain of justice 			
In the sense that give him what he has contributed 			
 It's quite a nice concept that is why if you give			
each person what he has contributed than zero profit condition comes 			
 That's how the one word theorem comes into			
picture 			
You see how this is micro economic foundation 			
Are you understanding me ?			
Because you can't have your micro economics without this kind of a			
thing 			
One another question 			
In actual life when you make a choice the choice is never			
like this because this assumes that always you buy a combination and			
not any one of them 			
Otherwise it would have beeen somewhere in the intercepting 			
The indifference curve always start from head here not here			
There is a need that I must have all the time a combination 			
that may not be so in actual life except when women are buying their			
 sarees and they want a matching blouse piece 			
Then only a combination question comes otherwise and			
moreover a saree and a blouse piece are not substitutes 			
 laughs they are compliment they are compliment and not			
substitutes and therefore you can't have law of substitution there			
Yeah so actual life what happens actual life is you go to a			
shop you ask the various prices and things like that			
You see the colour this that etcetera and so on 			
And you know how much you have the money and and therefore 			
then you can order them and take according to you the best 			
So it will be a line like this rather than a curve like this			
So but here we have got a choice model which is uh as if			
thing			
It is a world of its own 			
We have created a world of choice making 			
And then we are making assumptions about substitution and on			
the basis of that we are deciding the best using the tools of calculus 			
This is so in the economics of consumption economics of			
production of international trade any area you go 			
That is why Professor Samuel San when he wrote his book 			
 Foundations of Economic Analysis if you see that			
book you'll find from page one to the last page it is			
nothing but a systematic application of the theory of differential calculus			
The same tool the same kind of graph but they are interpreted			
 if instead of Q one and Q two I make it K and L it becomes an isoquant			
And instead of the budget constraint this becomes a cost line			
 isocostline and wherever they are tangential there it is a question			
of commodity substitution here it will be a question of fact of			
substitution 			
The terminology is different the context is different but the			
tool is the same 			
At the foundation of economic analysis you have dispariding of			
thinking 			
That is the first point I wanted to present to you because if			
you say what is at the foundation of micro economic is this behaviour is			
disparidgm 			
Madam Principal Prof Surendragopal Department of			
History and director I E S coaching Institute uh officers from the			
university different teachers coming from different parts of			
the Eastern regions students ladies and gentleman I am very			
happy that the course has been organised for increasing 			
proficiency in English 			
I am not uh myself a very proficient man in English uh being a			
student of uh mechanical engineering all throughout and as you know 			
the technocrats and scientists they mostly do through symbols 			
You will say is equal to we'll write a two parallel lines			
and it remain you see even the same thing 			
In fact uh any language is uh also a symbol 			
You have a vocabulary and you use words you combine			
them in such a way that it conveys your feelings 			
The general concept of having proficiency in English like a			
common man you will say if we get something written in a very uhm			
difficult or one word way they will say oh he is the man is very			
proficient or if you listen to a speech in which you don't			
follow most of the things then you will say that he is a very learned			
man we could not follow 			
But my concept is uh I mean and I think the people will also agree			
with me it's different 			
A man is having proficiency in any language if he is able			
to convey what he wants to 			
If you are not in a position to convey your feeling or your			
thinking or your thoughts then no matter which language you use 			
uh you are not fulfilling your objective 			
So I think this type of courses should we organised not			
only for those who are doing courses in English or uh those who have			
taken English as a subject but mostly for such persons who			
don't get opportunity to use English uh to that extent as is 			
done by other English student 			
For example technocrats or doctors you will see that these			
technical people even uh say for example a doctor he will write a			
prescription except a few those who are very brilliant otherwise			
also that you can't read the name of the medicines 			
I was very much surprised when you go to a compounder he will read			
and give the appropriate medicine 			
I was very much worried how that fellow can read and I can't read			
it 			
Then later on I don't know whether it is a fact or uh not 			
but somebody said The doctor they can't write the name of the			
medicine correctly they will always commit a spelling mistake so			
they just give some kind of symbol and a person who is uh dealing			
with all these kinds of medicine in day today life looking at the			
prescription that what is the disease what is the symptom they will			
give you the appropriate medicine 			
So that is the story for a technical people and you have I don't			
know how you have invited me either it is by virtue of the position I			
occupy in the University or I mean unknowingly you consider me very			
learned man that I can speak on any subject given to me 			
Originally I was asked to distribute the certificates only 			
and I mean I was very happy due to the simple reason that I will have			
the opportunity of listening to people having proficiency in			
English and at least I can uh learn how to write correct English			
 and increase uh some of my vocabulary 			
Anyway I am very happy that inspite of a very			
adverse social and political situation due to election and uh			
 adverse weather condition this sweating and intense heat 			
temperature uh mercury uh going up to forty-four degrees centigrade I			
think during this period itself 			
Lot of variation in the temperature 			
You have conducted the course upto the satisfaction of the			
participant as I could uh gather from the reaction survey 			
uh given by to a student you have stayed here you must			
I mean those who have come from outside they must uh have faced lot			
of difficulty I don't know whether you have taken them on some tour through			
 uh			
I don't know I'm I am not aware but I I I hope 			
uh they must have taken you round to the places uh like Rajgir or			
say Bodhgaya or some other uh uh places of tourist tourist			
interest 			
I especially thanks thank uh 			
those faculty members who have come from outside the state 			
By their presence our students have been encouraged 			
they have been benefitted and they uh will be benefitted in			
the long run even the course duration was rather uh only two and			
 three week 			
Three weeks but a still a three week			
 weeks are sufficient for this type of courses			
I express my sincere thanks uh to uh the Institute			
Central Institute of Foreign Language at Hyderabad for selecting			
Patna as one of the centre centres 			
Normally now the concept outside the state is Patna is a very			
disturbed place and rather it is very difficult in most of the			
situations to organise successfully uh such a course 			
I don't know whether it was well publicised or not because most			
of the participants are girls only few boys uh students I could find			
 and mostly they are from Patna university mostly from here 			
Uh so I believe it can be well publicise we can invite teacher			
 actually we really need to teach teacher how to teach			
English ?			
Or for that matter how to teach uhm what you call any			
subject ?			
Now this English is uh so much essential with the advent			
of computer and oth other electronic			
gadgets 			
Actually now we have developed a language which can be understood			
by a machine if you are using mostly in uh computer side 			
There a still either Hindi or English or for that uh sorry			
uh Sanskrit or any other language they don't have any place 			
still there			
Maybe with further development we can do it uh uh other			
languages also 			
But inspite of all uh uh effort efforts 			
 by the government or uh by other agencies to promote Hindi			
or any other language we can't do away with uh uh English 			
Because it is a language which is a essential for at			
least scientific knowledge 			
In the scientific world you can't do with any other language			
except English even in Russia or uh in France or any other			
country using some other kind of foreign language they've to			
write a computer programme in English 			
So they're actually mostly it is symbols			
But even using symbol with proper grammar of the machine language			
 becomes essential 			
With all these words I again thank all the participants			
and congratulate the student students for 			
a participating in such type of course 			
I am thankful to the authorities for giving me an			
opportunity to be with the learned scholar scholars			
 from all over the country or mostly from the Eastern region			
state and the participants of the schools 			
Thank you very much clapping 			
What I propose to do this morning is to reinforce some of			
the points that I made yesterday and then move on to two or			
three new points 			
Let me say firmly and with all the uhm with with			
the power underlying my perception of teaching in India that grammar has			
a very important role to play 			
So grammar is not out 			
Don't go back with the impression that grammar is out 			
Grammar is in because as I said yesterday grammar is the heart			
and soul of a human language 			
No grammar no language 			
Language means grammar 			
Now the question is that we are teaching and learning English as a			
second language how should we present the facts of grammar in a			
classroom situation to facilitate the learning of English which			
means use of English effectively in a variety of situations 			
So it's not a question that we are not uh sitting here 			
to say that alright grammar is out now 			
What we are trying to say is what is going to be the best way of			
presenting the facts of grammar 			
So that's point number o one			
 			
Point number two is that it's very difficult to			
draw a sharp line between grammar and lexis 			
And therefore in producing our teaching materials you will			
have to have two types of materials to be highlighted B B			
writing 			
And these two types of materials will be sentence-based grammar			
 and word-based grammar 			
And one of the excellent reference books at the secondary			
level is even now that old Palmer's Grammar of English Words			
He selected about thousand productive words and he has			
presented the grammar of those words in the form of a dictionary			
 It's an excellent book even now 			
And we are going to do these two within the over-all			
frame-work of B B writing 			
So we are going to organise our materials grammar materials			
in two parts sentence-based grammar and word-based grammar 			
But whether it's sentence-based grammar or word-based			
grammar the actual presentation will take place in the context of 			
discourse of because the point that I made yesterday we are not			
interested in grammar for the sake of grammar 			
We are not interested in rules for the sake of rules 			
We are interested in making the rules function making the			
rules function 			
How do we make use of rules to produce language texts or			
discourse materials ?			
So that's second point 			
Uh an example of word-based grammar will be B B writing			
 the choice of verb 			
You have a network of verbs and then which one to select			
 in a given context or in a given text 			
And then the grammar will say Once you have selected this			
 then your choice here is restricted which will also mean that			
 B B writing this will rule out the possibility of 			
 A that clause coming after this whereas if you			
select C then you can have A 			
 that clause 			
Third point which I would like to reinforce is B B writing			
The learner's mind is that mysterious black box 			
and our ultimate objective is language as I said yesterday is a			
meaningful human activity 			
This is the meaning this is the experience this is human			
experience 			
 How do I say 			
What are the possible forms that I should be using to convey this			
meaning or this experience ?			
And the whole thing is processed mysteriously by this			
learned black box 			
So once again we are moving from we are not saying that form is			
useless 			
What we are saying is Language is a meaningful			
activity 			
So what the learners have to have their focus on is 			
This is the meaning this is what I propose to do 			
Language that's why one of the titles of Halliday's			
 important book is Learning How to Mean 			
This is a very important concept 			
Second language learning a second language means 			
Learning how to mean in a new context of culture 			
Learning how to mean 			
How do I mean ?			
I know how to mean in my mother tongue 			
How do I mean in my other tongue which is English ?			
So learning how to mean is Learning to categorise			
human experiences you remember the point that I made multilingual			
view of the universe bi-focal view of the universe 			
This is when I have English glasses on this is how the world			
appears 			
When I have my Marathi glasses on this is how 			
Now I am using English in the Marathi context of culture 			
How do I use English ?			
Again inspite of all that you keep on saying your students are			
going to address you as respected sir which is not English but 			
 chalta hai 			
In our context of culture it's something which is			
very important they want to show their respect for their teachers			
So we are moving from meaning to form 			
 It's movement just as yesterday we said we are moving			
from fluency to accuracy 			
Ultimately our ultimate objective is to help learners produce texts			
And once they start producing texts the text must be			
linguistically also accurate 			
But we are not going to clears throat to put a check			
on the fluency right at the beginning 			
We are going to encourage them to play with language 			
Just as a human child in the context of his L one plays with			
language tries out experiments tries out all kinds of tricks 			
So we will allow a second language learner also to play with			
his language 			
But as a teacher we are around and we keep on saying Oh			
I see what you meant to say is Has he come this morning			
 ?			
And things like that			
So what we are doing is as a result of interaction what			
you are doing is exposing him to your concept of the standard			
variety of this language 			
So in fact all movements are from dialectal varieties			
idiolectal varieties to a frozen standard variety of language for the			
time being 			
So we are moving from dialect from idiolect to what we			
consider at a given point of time to be the standard formal variety			
of that language 			
Then I said that every teacher of a second language in			
fact I will say also of first language has to have a set of 			
B B writing reference tools 			
And the two important tools are B B writing 			
As teachers we must get into the habit of looking up a			
standard reference grammar and looking up something in a standard			
dictionary 			
When in doubt go to Cobuild or			
 Longman or we have had for years in the			
field of E L T Advanced Learner's English Dictionary			
 which we have been using			
But we have now better dictionaries as reference dictionaries			
Grammar I said we need three types or three levels B			
B writing reference grammar 			
 What do I say is this alright ?			
Now you will find that in all the states in the country today			
 newspapers they have I don't know about Maharashtra but down south			
 Deccan Herald Hindu now Deccan			
Chronicle News Time they have a column every week either			
 Know Your English Subramaniam or 			
Mind Your Language or Yadurajan's I forget the title			
of his series 			
So there is a big demand is this the right kind of English that			
we are using ?			
And this demand is coming from senior I A S officers senior			
executives 			
 Am I really right the way I am writing the way I am			
drafting ?			
So there is a big demand for grammar 			
 It's not true that there is no demand for grammar and 			
it's not at the learner's level it's at fairly			
advanced level 			
People feel that if they are going to make a sophisticated use of			
language then they must be accurate 			
So accuracy comes at that level after you have started			
handling the language in your own way then at a particular level you feel			
that it must be grammatically accurate 			
Of course there is nothing like one standard form there are			
varieties of standard forms also B B writing 			
Then we have teacher's grammar 			
Now the reference grammar derives all the insight from a 			
linguist's grammar a linguistically oriented description of a			
language and for example I will treat Quirk Greenbaum 			
and Svadvik A comprehensive reference grammar of modern English			
 			
Because what they have done is they have captured the insights			
from Transformational Grammar Chomsky's Generative Grammar 			
 Halliday's Systemic Grammar Filmore's Case Grammar 			
Traditional Grammar and then put them together 			
So it becomes an exhaustive comprehensive description of			
contemporary English 			
 Teacher's grammar at different levels for teachers we			
have to have different levels of grammar which the teachers will need			
 in order to teach B B writing 			
 Learner's grammar will have minimal of technical terms 			
and the main focus will be use of language in a variety of situations 			
I will give you an example in a minute 			
For example B B writing we set an exercise on 			
Ramu's routine activities every morning 			
The focus is on every morning 			
What does he do every morning ?			
Now see our emphasis is on every morning 			
A person who does something every morning as a matter			
of habit habitually 			
So although we are not saying that what we are going to have in			
this text is simple or habitual present but we are highlighting that			
indirectly 			
Because our main thing is characteristic activities of this			
person every morning 			
What he does every morning ?			
So he gets out of bed at six every morning he brushes his			
teeth and so on so on so on 			
And then at end we have a box item 			
After they have practised language you have a box item and			
this box item is for generalization in the form of grammar 			
And we say this is what in grammar is called the simple present			
And you underline the simple present 			
So we are not teaching the simple present for the sake of the			
simple present 			
We are saying that there are certain things activities which a			
human being does habitually repeatatively again and again regularly			
 and that gets focused you can underline that and then at the end you have			
 the simple present as a box item 			
In fact this mechanism of box item was used by I forget 			
the name of that American linguist uh Felix it will come back			
 to my mind later 			
Lado			
 Haan 			
Fries and Lados			
No no not Fries and Lado they you we had Rapid			
Review of English Grammar we have ten or twelve copies 			
Prininska sir Prininska			
Prininska Prininska yes Prininska			
 Trusty matter that's all			
Ah ha yeah 			
Some Prininska			
 Haan haan yeah			
 A few words 			
 Let's take anothe another			
 example B B writing 			
The passive B B writing 			
Even in our text books we have to organize it in two parts 			
Right at the beginning there should be uh some kind of			
 some instructions built into the text which the teacher is			
supposed to follow in teaching presenting that particular lesson			
or that particular text item 			
For the teacher it's very important for him to know that			
 B B writing 			
This is the formal representation 			
If it's not there then it's not be 			
passive			
It may be some other kind of passive 			
So the teacher must be familiar with this that the real form			
of the passive will be a choice of a form of the verb to be followed by			
 the main verb or whatever verb comes after it in the past participle			
form 			
 That's one thing that the teacher must know 			
Second thing that the teacher must know is it's a			
 mechanism a linguistic mechanism a language mechanism for promoting			
the object and demoting the subject 			
But this is for the teacher 			
What are the situations that are that may necessitate the use			
of the passive ?			
The situational factors are that we are either not interested			
in the agent in the doer or that the doer is unknown or that the			
doer doesn't need any mention 			
Then the sufferer the affected the receiver comes to			
the front 			
This is subject position and the verb has a marked feature			
 be plus in past participle 			
So the teacher must know that the use of the passive is			
context governed use 			
 It's the context that gives you a clue to the use of			
the passive 			
And if you look at your text 			
You see Blood Transfusion 			
Now this is a kind of text which belongs to the register of			
science 			
And in the register of science unless it is biographical or			
autobiographical the doer is not so important 			
 It's the action that is important it's the			
activity that's important 			
 It's the thing done that's important			
So I have marked on the first two pages at least ten examples			
of the passive 			
Where they say now this is done every day with good results			
Uh very little can be done now about this because it has already			
been done 			
Change may be caused if you do this 			
A soldier may be brought in and put to bed 			
A man's blood was changed 			
Man could be put into something something something 			
These were the things which were asked 			
This was tried out 			
It was done and so on 			
So on the first two pages I find that the focus is on			
activity on the action done on the thing achieved rather than on the			
agent or the doer 			
Principal Madavee Shri Suresh			
Pendse who has been put in a position of eminence in			
a most unexpected manner Dr Shastri Prof Pradhan Shri			
 Dhuri who is sitting just below me on the right hand side			
 and Shri Tatyasaheb Patwardhan or Tatya Patwardhan			
if not Tatyasaheb and members of the resource person team 			
members of the staff of the English department of this college and 			
fellow participants in this two day seminar on the method			
or methods of teaching or trying to teach varieties of English 			
to the twelfth standard boys and girls who happen to join our college			
When Prof Uppar it may be pronounced as upper also you see			
 laughter that also is there saw me in my residence at Bombay			
 and showed me the letter of the principal			
I said see I am most innocent into bracket ignorant of the			
subject matter of your discussions or participations 			
On my great teacher later on I'll have his I have something			
to say about him uh Dr V K Gokak 			
Uh it was said of him that he had a first in English we			
don't say first class we say first means first class 			
In English language and literature in the university of Oxford in			
the year nineteen hundred and thirty-eight 			
And I matriculated in nineteen forty 			
And Karmveer Bhaurao sent me to this great teacher in Sangli			
 and I was a little student with a Gandhi cap 			
When I first told that our sir had got a first class in English			
language and literature I didn't understand the distinction between the			
two 			
Later on I came to know what literature was and what			
language is or is likely to be 			
And being a teacher of English for nearly twenty-three or			
twenty-four years I was never in charge of teaching grammar 			
My acquaintance with English is through Tarkhadkar translation			
number one number two number three 			
Perhaps you do not know who Tarkhadkar was ? laughter 			
Or why he bothered to write these three books of translation when			
one was quite enough ?			
A Kale's lesson in English translation Rao was Kale's			
 younger brother Satara R R Kale 			
 Kale's lessons in English translation 			
So I matriculated as I said in nineteen forty so our method			
of methodology of teaching English at Satara was to put it very 			
roughly very crude 			
But having come into contact your Principal said Prof Patil is			
a living example I hope it is still living laughter 			
And as I was telling my old friend Suresh Pendase in the bus in			
the car that he was so kind enough to place at our disposal 			
I received letters from my friends Barrister P G Patil			
 Ajeev Sevak Rayat Shikshan Sanstha Satara 			
Now the word is aajeev sevak they said			
 ajeev sevak ajeev means nirjeev 			
laughter 			
And if by looking at me if he has that idea I wouldn't quarrel			
with him laughter 			
So this literature the horizon of literature was			
open before us in that small college with a population of a its			
enrollment was Dr Shastri I myself don't believe when I joined Sangli			
 Willingdon college Sangli Gokaksaheb who had come from Oxford the			
strength was three hundred and fifty 			
All four classes of Arts and two classes of upto inter-science			
 six classes three hundred and fifty 			
And the professors were about thirty-five			
That means per every professor ten students which is a good			
good quota I see 			
And as I said Dr Gokak came from Oxford trailing clouds of			
glory do we come from Heaven from God who is our home 			
Now I am in my proper element uh not grammar but literature 			
I had these two lines young men and women are from			
Wordsworth Ode On Intimations Of Immortality From Recollections of			
Early Childhood 			
This is the mouth feeling type Ode on Intimations of			
immortality from recollections of early childhood 			
And there Wordsworth is developing the thesis of 			
samadhi 			
When we are laid asleep in body and becoming living soul 			
samadhi uh don't think about samadhi because			
you are very young men and you not bother about that just now 			
laughter 			
And there is a famous stanza which begins with where these			
lines occur Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting The			
soul that rises with us our life's Star Hath had elsewhere			
it setting and cometh from from afar Not in entire forgetfulness 			
And not in utter nakedness But trailing clouds of glory do we come from			
God who is our Home Heaven lies about us in our infancy Shades of			
the prison-house begin to close around the growing boy And he sees it in			
his joy Until at last the vision fades far away Into the light of			
common day 			
Now I have quoted about ten or twelve lines which I heard from			
 the lips of my great teacher 			
When I was sitting on the very first bench that was my only			
distinction 			
Sitting on the first bench because sometimes Mr president			
our one of our teachers in Sangli was not speaking loudly enough 			
So I said sir you are not being audible even on the first			
bench whereas our teacher said and the principal the Dr Shastri			
has allowed me the free use of Marathi language occasionally 			
So he said you can't hear me ?			
I said no sir I can't hear in Marathi 			
laughter in Marathi 			
A man who thinks about this filling things etcetera he			
has missed his way in the college 			
So Dr Gokak this is how we see he used to			
And Dr Gokak never stood on one spot on the platform 			
He used to move from one end of the platform to the other			
Those of you who have visited Sangli Willingdon college you know			
that F Y Arts class 			
And in those days Dr Shastri as you know the professors had to			
wear a dark gown 			
Town and gown town and gown this is a a terminology from			
the university of Oxford and Cambridge 			
Town means people from the city and gown means people 			
students from the university 			
Town and gown that has become very brown now so uh that is			
 laughter 			
And so Dr Gokak used to play with us as if we were little			
children in the family 			
He used to engage two periods in the F Y Arts classroom which 			
which principal would engage F Y Arts students or P G students 			
I understand these days principals don't bother to take any class			
at all laughter 			
I hope you see this time dishonour rule does not obtain in			
this college laughter 			
Because basically uh I was so happy to know that your			
principal gets a salary of eight thousand rupees 			
laughter eight thousand 			
And when I started teaching in Sangli uh Satara under Karmveer			
Bhaurao my salary per month after B A London Bar at Law was seventy-five			
basic and forty-five days allowance laughter 			
This is Arabian Nights stories laughter 			
 B A Bar at Law B A London Bar at Law salary one			
hundred one hundred and twenty rupees 			
This fellow should be sent to the Yeroda or mental home 			
laughter 			
And when uh Dr Shastri was saying uh sir what about 			
vice-Chancellor's pay I was getting two thousand rupees as V C 			
vice-Chancellor V C 			
But the work was so difficult that rather then be V C I went to W C			
 laughter 			
And my salary at that time was two thousand rupees 			
and income tax and other tax cut I use to get fourteen hundred 			
rupees per month 			
But money is neither here nor there			
What what salary did Karmveer Bhaurao get ?			
No salary because he was an honorary worker 			
And hence boys and girls I am a a very senior persons so			
you are all boys and girls for me laughter 			
I was taught this poem in the fourth standard the eighth standard			
now fourth standard in my time Abu Ben Adham 			
Adam means Aadam 			
Really it is Aadam but this Lee Hunts did not			
know Aadam 			
So whether it is Aadam or Adam or Adham same			
thing 			
 Abu ben Adhem A D H E M May his tribe			
increase this is a famous phrase in English May his tribe			
increase 			
Today our tribes are increasing by leaps and bounds on the			
family front laughter 			
So Abu ben Adhem may his tribe increase 			
and I'm quoting this poem please remember the way I am keeping			
time keeping rhythm 			
This is how our teacher used to teach us Abu ben Adhem			
may his tribe increase Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace 			
deep dream of peace 			
Some of you uh gentlemen have dreams 			
Some of the dreams are black and white			
Some some professors get into technicolour dreams but that			
is alright laughter 			
 Awoke from from from one night amo from a deep			
dream of peace And saw within the moonlight in his room Making it			
rich and like a lily in bloom 			
Lily not name of a girl Lily or Leela 			
 Like a lily in bloom making it rich and like a lily in			
bloom 			
He saw in his dream an angel writing in a book of gold 			
exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold 			
Gold rhyming with bold 			
 Exceeding peace had made Ben Adehm bold And he wri			
 he asked him what writest thou 			
Tarkhadkar translation today you don't know what thou is ?			
I write we write Thou writest he writes she writes they write 			
Where is thou now ?			
T H O U thou that is now planted and supplanted also 			
Janabai that famous Saint of Maharashtra says Yega			
Yega Veethabai Maze Pandhariche Aai 			
Uh I remember this not because I am Pandurang Patil 			
You see yega yega veethabai maze pandariche aai 			
 Vitthal is suppose to be a mother and so yega yega			
veethabai 			
We say this is unmannerly you should say yaho yaho			
Vithalrao kuthe gela hota magapasun laughter 			
So yega yega veethabai maze pandhariche aai 			
so that thou thou pronoun is to be used when you are addressing God 			
when you are addressing your parents or mother and when you are			
addressing your beloved			
Forget about the third thing but if you say God laughter			
 and our mother 			
Whenever most of us go barefooted in our childhood			
and whenever you see a thorn pricks into our sole S O L E sole of			
our so we say aai ga 			
Do we say baba ho ?			
Aai ga that is the significance of yega yega			
Veethabai 			
So thou What writest thou 			
The angel was writing like this			
 The vision raised its head and said the names of			
those whom love of Lord has blessed 			
I don't know what your name is Mr so and so I am writing down			
the names in my book of gold the names of those whom love of Lord had			
blessed 			
Now this is a list of successful people 			
 So Abu ben says is mine one 			
Is my name in the list of successful lottery winners ?			
 Is mine one Nay not so 			
Nay of course today you don't use nay 			
We say N E I G H that's different neigh laughter			
A horse neighs and the lion roars which is neigh			
Nay N A Y means no nay not so your name is not there 			
When Abu knew that his name was not the poet has used the word 			
in the next line Abu spake more low 			
 Nav hai ka ?			
Nahi ararara 			
Abu spake spoke more low 			
 Then write me as one who loves his fellowmen 			
If my name is not there in the list of people whom love of Lord			
has blessed then write me as one who who loves his fellowmen 			
 The angel wrote and vanished 			
Generally Angels don't come back a second time 			
 The next night it came again with a great wakening			
light 			
The light which woke up Abu with a great wakening light			
 And showed the names of those whom love of Lord has			
blessed 			
And la last line Lo L O			
 means beholds 			
 Lo Ben Adhems name led all the rest 			
Means he stood first in the first class 			
I have recited this sonnet a poem with fourteen lines			
 because this is the description of all benifactors of mankind 			
whether they are people like Sadguru Gadage Maharaj 			
I was professor at Sadguru Gadage Maharaj Karad and			
beyond our college there is a another college started by Yashwantrao			
 Chavan's institute Science college Yashawantrao Chavan			
science college now Venutai Cha Arts college now 			
And those colleges had very majestic and imposing buildings			
As your principal has said six buildings worth sixteen 			
lakhs of rupees 			
So I can't I have not not only cou not counted but I			
can't see so much amount of money haven't seen so much amount of money 			
And our Gadage Maharaj college was only a a monastery 			
math of Sadguru Gadage Maharaj a small building unimposing			
building and me and Mrs Patil working there 			
And the boys used to be matriculates from our high-school 			
Because as the principal said we run forty-four colleges and			
three-hundred and seventy-eight high-schools 			
Not even your director of education department run such an			
enterprise 			
So we asked the boys you see why is it that you see you are over			
stepping us and going to that college 			
They said sir your Gadage Maharaj college is only a math			
 Gadage Maharaja's math 			
laughter 			
And that is true this person Gadage Maharaj Gadage			
Those of you who come from rural areas know what a gadage			
 is ? laughter 			
These days nobody has seen a gadage 			
We have only seen 			
He had this royal insignia this earthenware pot was the royal			
insignia of this great saint gadage 			
Ladies and gentleman when you were born very few of you have 			
been born in a nursing home because to be born in a nursing home you			
have to give a previous notice to the doctor			
In our case no notice was ever given laughter 			
Why we were born is a mystery ? laughter 			
How we were born is a still greater mystery ?			
And where we were born is a matter of conjecturing 			
Because my father was a primary school teacher and therefore			
he has written out written down noted the date of			
my birth 			
But some of you not know your dates of birth 			
Gentlemen if you read a famous book in English 			
Autobiography of Booker T Washington Booker T Washing T means Telliferd			
Booker Telliferd Washington the negro educator who died in nineteen			
hundred and sixty 			
Karmveer Bhaurao has been influenced by him also 			
Booker T Washington's autobiograpy is named as 			
 Up from Slavery Up from Slavery translated			
into Marathi as Atmaudhar 			
And the very first sentence of that autobiography is I was			
born somewhere and some when 			
Where I was born nobody knows and when I was born nobody knows			
So this we were born in a dingy room on a makeshift			
cot 			
Not a modern cot but a makeshift cot 			
And when our mother have delivered us or must have delivered			
us we were heated by the coals put in an earthern ware pot 			
So our association with this earthenware pot 			
gadaga is from our birth 			
And when we are about to breathe our last may it be a far off			
event you see when we are about to breathe our last somebody has to			
carry an earthen pot before the funeral procession 			
Ah uhm uh thank you very much uh professor Kohli 			
spoke so nice words about me uh I don't know how much I deserve			
them 			
Uhm professor Kohli requested me to talk on 			
National income uh accounts 			
Uhm my purpose here was to make things very simple 			
Uh maybe what my idea was this is a most of you are			
teachers and you know in a class when you go to a class 			
there are bright students there are mediocres there are bit			
dull students also 			
So teacher has a big problem of uh satisfying all the 			
students 			
So now comes the question what level he should go 			
It should benefit most of them			
So one has to be bit uh see that everybody follows 			
Uh now we have that gathering I see most of you have put in			
some more than a decade of service 			
And most of you are uhm good good having good			
experience in teaching uhn 			
What I want to do here is only thing is some of you may not be			
having uh background about National income accounts 			
and other things 			
Uh with that intention I want to give some idea about what			
 National income accounts is ?			
How it is useful ?			
And how it is computed ?			
And then in the second lecture I would give try to			
give you uhn the backgr the trends in India 			
 Indian economy 			
What is the per capita income of a India ?			
This thing and how it is computed ?			
What are its weaknesses this is for todays programme 			
Uhm as I told in beginning this is li I would like to make			
it as simple as possible without ma uh this thing 			
 I my main idea is that everybody should get			
something uh that is the thing they should feel it okay 			
Others who are more interest in deeper questions can			
approach me again uh your all all the time you are welcome and			
 it's a great pleasure to have interaction with you 			
Now uh if I ask anybody What is in			
 income ?			
 What is your income ?			
You may say some six thousand seven thousand or ten thousand			
 things 			
But it it looks to be very simple question 			
But if we go deeper it is not as simple as you think at			
the first time 			
Uhm take uh this income somebody mainly we who are			
salaried person by income we meant whatever salary we are getting			
that monthly that is the salary			
Or at the best you say okay whatever our take home salary is there			
 after deductions 			
Okay we are having ten thousand salary or some two thousand is			
deducted eight thousand is our take home salary 			
This we take it as a income 			
This but if we go deeper this is not the only total			
income 			
For example some of us may have some own house 			
In that way we also get a a rent imputed rent 			
So our income consist not only of salary but also the rent of			
the house in which we are living because if we go for some other rented			
house we had to pay that rent for that house 			
Now because it is our own house we are not paying so 			
indirectly it means that we are getting that much income			
We are not uh paying cash but because we are utilising			
that uh services of that residence resident it also means 			
it is uh rent 			
We are getting rent in this thing 			
Our income also should include salary beside salary it			
should include the rent 			
Some of us may have put some fixed deposit in the bank 			
F D 			
So annually we may get some interest 			
That also is a part of the our income 			
That thing interest that we get on our fixed deposit or saving			
accounts in our bank 			
 My maybe it may be small amount but uh for uh 			
conceptual purpose it should be included			
Maybe we may if we take in our bank account uh may be			
interest we may be getting hardly per annum some fifteen twenty			
 rupees or hundred rupees per annum			
because our savings may not be much			
But it is also a part of our income that interest that we get			
Then we may have bought some shares or dividends 			
Uh this is mostly the salaried persons buy the shares and this			
things 			
The dividends that we get on that uh shares also a			
part of our income 			
Next component we may think we may have some people may have			
agriculture land they at their own native place 			
From agriculture they will be getting some either they may			
have leased out the land to some tenant and getting rent on it that			
is a rent from the land 			
Or they may be having share cropping they may contribute			
something to the cultivation and for uh tenants cultivates and they			
get share cropping will be there 			
This also forms a part of our income 			
So uh in the beginning when you thought what is income 			
you took it as salary income means only salary for salaried			
persons			
But actually if we go deeper it includes many other components			
 which we generally uh don't take care of notice it 			
That it actually income is such a broad concept 			
When income is a for of a individual is so 			
difficult to compute or even assess uh what about the 			
country's income 			
 Country's income means income of all the people in the			
country 			
 It's all the more difficult 			
What we mean by natio income of the nation or national			
income ?			
The national income means the value of the output which is			
 produced in the country the final goods value of the final			
goods produced in the country is taken as national income			
Now here I use the concept final goods 			
Why we should use final goods ?			
Because if we don't take account of this we'll 			
have some problems called double counting 			
Suppose wa if you want to if you don't 			
take care of this there is a problem of double counting 			
Suppose you take the case of uh a simple example which is			
given is about the bread industry 			
So if you take the what all the total value of the bread produced			
in the country 			
Total value of the wheat produced in the country 			
Total value of the fertiliser produced in the country 			
There will be double counting or treble counting how ?			
When you take the value of the bread that value of the bread			
also consist contains the value of the wheat used in the 			
making of bread 			
So uh the and when you take the value of the			
total wheat again you are counting that portion of wheat which has gone			
into the making of bread also 			
Whatever that all wheat produced in the country will not go to			
making bread but atleast some wheat is goes in making of bread			
So the wheat is counted twice 			
Wheat is counted when you are taking the total value of bread 			
wheat is also counted when you are taking the total value of wheat			
And also think of fertiliser which is used in making of 			
this bread uh wheat 			
 Producing uh for producing wheat we make use of			
fertiliser 			
The value of the fertiliser is contained in the value of wheat 			
again it is also contained in the value of uh bread 			
So if you don't take care of only uh final goods 			
we'll be commiting this uh mistake of counting the same			
items more than once 			
So we should try to avoid this 			
Now comes the question how to know which is final good			
 which is not the final good 			
So is bread the final good or is wheat the final good 			
is fertiliser final good 			
So because there is a difficulty in distinguishing which			
is final good and which is intermediary good we have another to			
overcome this problem we have a method called value added method 			
In that means uh in each industry how much value is added			
 by each industry 			
That we take into account not the total value of the output of			
 bread industry 			
 We'll only take the how much bread industry has			
 added the value to the product 			
So baking bread baking so they have pro sold			
the bread at ten rupees and uh they have bought the			
input of say eight rupees worth of inputs for			
buying wheat and other things they have paper and packing other things 			
They have brought uh purchased the bread industry has purchased			
eight rupees worth of inputs and they have sold the			
bread for ten rupees 			
So now they how much value they have added to this			
bread they have added the value of ten two rupees 			
because eight rupees was the value of inputs which they have			
purchased ei ten rupees they have sold 			
So that to bread uh that final product which we 			
suppose we take it bread for that bread they have added uh uhm 			
value of two rupees 			
This is how we uh take it as uh value added 			
So one has to be while computing national income one			
has to be careful in avoiding this double counting or counting the same			
item more than once 			
Then another thing we have to notice is this national income is in			
only money terms because we are hetregenous items are			
produced 			
Iron is produced uh foodgrain is produced so many items are			
produced 			
So it is a it is expressed only in money terms 			
Agriculture output could have been produced in uh mentioned in			
physical terms whereas national income has to be expressed in money			
terms			
This is another important thing to be noted 			
So we require some prices 			
What prices should we use is another difficult question uh to			
answer 			
Then we have to notice that it is a flow concept 			
Flow means how much output produced during a particular year			
or a particular month 			
Instead what is the value of uh income means income			
per month or income per annum like that			
So flow means the period time period is important 			
 It is a national income is a flow concept that means			
how much value has been produced from January first nineteen ninety-six to			
 December thirty-first nineteen ninety-six 			
In this aca calendar year how much is produced			
So it is a flow concept 			
Uh these are the some of the important things to be noticed			
about a national income 			
Now what is the use of national income if it consist 			
outside if uh ask this question at which national income is 			
used as a economic barometre 			
Like what is the condition of the economy to know the			
condition of the economy 			
Like a doctor if you go to a doctor before you			
ask any question he will put his thermometre into your mouth 			
And he wants to know the temperature uh things			
So a economist also if he wants to know the condition of			
any economy he says what is per national income of the country 			
So that means some uh weaknesses in this national income			
 but it broadly indicates the health of the economy how good how			
 sound is the health of the economy 			
So this is necessary national income is necessary to know			
 health of the economy 			
And also we can compare two economies which economy is			
stronger economically 			
For intercountry comparison is also it is useful 			
So how so America is rich you know how much in a 			
what is the per capita income in India what is the per capita in America			
Say twenty times it is more than in India 			
Or thirty times more than in India 			
So that shows how rich they are 			
So for in relative comparison also this uh 			
national income is useful 			
Then within the country also we have so many different states			
And we want to compare uh which state is better which is			
doing well 			
So which is richer state uh like that			
So interstate comparison also to make interstate			
comparison also this uh na state income uh estimates			
are being made these days 			
Then we know over a period of time how country is			
growing 			
To assess the performence of an economy also this pe			
 national income data is very useful 			
Then you can also see uh that uh in the economy there			
are different sectors like household sector we have 			
We have corporate sector we have government sector 			
What is the interaction of these sectors that is how much 			
how much is government sector is taking away from the household			
sector how much government in the form of tax how much government			
sector is taking away from the corporate sector in the form of tax 			
Uh prof Deshpande the coordinator for this particular			
course in English of the Academic Staff college Marathawada University			
 prof Shastri visiting professor here and my friends 			
Professor Deshpande of course uh was attempting to apply			
cosmetics to many of the short comings that I possess 			
And he was praising many of the things which I don't deserve to			
the power of yen 			
So you've got to take everything that he says with a 			
pinch of salt if not with a ton of salt 			
Uh having said that uh God only knows how desperately 			
I wanted to become what uh the standard coach of the Marathwada			
University says as a non-teaching employee of a non- Agricultural			
University laughter 			
So that's what I wanted to become 			
And uh unfortunately various development took place and			
uh as a consequence I am here trying to discuss things with you share			
some of my thoughts with you so that's the background 			
But anyway it gives me a lot of pleasure to meet many of my old			
students and old friends in this congregation 			
Although I had initially promised to uh lecture to you of a			
 seven hours in a weeks time unfortunately because of various factors I am			
unable to meet you for this uh duration 			
But I think I am going to think of it what I would have			
normally spoken in seven hours in just two lecturing units 			
I am going to cover most of the things in these two			
lectures			
The first topic would be on the Broad Fields and 			
Conventions in American Literature and it would be followed up by the			
various Fictual concepts that are employed in any discussion of American			
literature 			
Now to start with let me establish a comparative frame			
of uh reference between Indian writing in English and American			
literature 			
I fondly recall that both these topics were introduced at my			
old Alma mater Andhra University way back in the year nineteen hundred and			
sixty-two 			
That was the year when one of the earliest of one word 			
scholar to have collected a degree in the United States of America			
professor Raghavacharalu had come back with a Ph D from the University of			
Pennsylvenia and my old teacher professor Shrinivas Iyengar had			
uh written a pioneering book on Indian writing in English			
So these two streams came to a head and we were very fortunate			
to be students and that was the year when I graduated and I wanted to			
pursue my research			
But uh in the department itself there was a good deal of			
discussion about Indian writing in English			
Even the topic itself had become controversial debatable 			
they were toying with the idea of employing the term Indian English			
writing or uh Indo- Anglican or Anglian uh writing and ultimately			
Iyengar thought that Indian writing in English would be broadly 			
descriptive and proper			
And Raghavacharlu introduced American literature			
So we belong to the first generation of students who were exposed			
to these two streams 			
And surprisingly we also had the a sort of exhibition every			
fourth year the University organises an exhibition it's so easy			
for people belonging to the various science faculty to display all their			
technological wonder and innovation			
But then for students of literature what can they do so			
what we had done was to graphically visually represent various aspect			
of American literature Indian writing in English and we had drawn various			
charts 			
And I still remember uh we drew a X axis and a Y axis 			
And there was a confluence of influence between the political			
happenings and the li literary 			
development 			
A crucial periods of time remarkable text was produced that was			
the end result of our own research			
I wish I had kept an old copy of uh that visual display 			
And one would notice that in many respects the development			
and the growth of Indian writing in English and that of American			
literature seems to have taken a broad pattern a particular			
configuration which is comparable 			
And uh if you go to the beginning you would notice that uh			
 the elements of Indian writing in English were triggered off they			
were given the necessary one word mainly because of the famous			
minutes of Lord Macaulay in the year eighten hundred and thirty-five 			
And uh if you are student of American literure you would			
notice that uh we normally divide American literature into the usable			
path and the the vibrant American literature which uh 			
acquired a particular shape and a dimension in the year eighteen			
hundred and thirty particularly when uh uh Emerson delivered that			
famous speech addressed the Phi Betta Kappa association of Howard 			
even it is cool the speech which is one word on uh which			
was later on come to be known as American scholar speech			
And now a days everybody come to this this particular speech			
delivered by Emerson as uh the literary declaration of independence			
So that's the importance that they give			
So one notices that uh in terms of uh the time sequence			
 the growth and uh progress they're comparable although			
America was discovered technically within course because we are			
celebrating the quincentenary year of the discovery of America			
Columbus reached the shores of America in the year fourteen			
hundred and ninety-two perhaps in the month of uh August and uh 			
precisely on August sixth 			
And uh you know the basic thing he was in search of a			
passage to India and then he discovered a passage to the new world			
And uh in the initial stages of course most of the			
literature was in the nature of uh letters addressed to relatives			
friends back home in Portugal and in Spain because he was commissioned by			
King Ferdinand to undertake this uh trip			
And uh this sort of a epistolary exercise formed the source			
of American literature but uh most patriot Americans would like to claim			
 that uh even the name of the person who discovered America had been			
rather Portugal 			
His name is Christopher Columbus 			
Christopher meaning Christ bearer Columbus meaning the person			
who illuminates column that's the unit which measures light			
So this is symbolically speaking Christopher Columbus			
discovering America established the influence of light over the			
forces of darkness that's how they symbolically tried to explain 			
the significance of Columbus discovering America 			
And uh the later immigration took place in the early part of			
the seventeenth century uh particularly with the myth lover 			
compact and uh the pilgrims landing on the Plymoth rock 			
Apart from various jokes that are bandit about one of the joke			
says that uh instead of the Pilgrim father landing on the uh Plymouth			
rock if the Plymouth were to land on the pilgrims one word uh			
things would have been much better there won't have been any genocides of			
Indians in America not to speak of the genocide that was committed in			
Vietnam etcetera etcetera			
Atleast the ugly Americans would have been saved the image of			
the ugly Americans			
So apart from these things one uh has a perception about			
the influence of religion uh in so far as the American writing is uh			
concerned mainly because of the radical differences of perception 			
religious differences the interness and battles particularly between the			
Puritans and the Anglicans 			
In England it's one word over and uh the			
immigration to America took place and the initial writing was broadly			
conditioned by these uh denominational cause 			
Uh the Calvanistic street became very very important and as a			
consequence of this one word Calvanistic street			
They thought that the founding of America was a new			
opportunity for mankind it's uh Europe had become totally			
corrupt and therefore people are saying what is happening in Bosnia 			
and Herzegovina and Sarajevo which gave rise to the first world war			
because uh Archduke Ferdinand was killed and uh that released various			
forces which resulted in the beginning of the First World War			
And people are worried that one word ethnic strife			
would spread all over Europe and who knows the Third World War might			
start from this particular cockpit in Europe			
Now the root of uh the migration towards America uh			
refered in the broad denominational fight that took place all over Europe			
between the Anglicans who were one variety of uh Catholics and this			
Puritans			
And uh they believed in the Calvanistic dictum of 			
 determin determinism and all these things			
they percolated into the general psyche of uh the American immigrant			
there			
And initial literature in America is conditioned by uh this			
sort of a uhm shall we say denominational and uh religious 			
conflict and strife okay			
We have uh various Calvanist fighting it out to establish			
mainly because they thought that uh uhm the discovery of America opened			
up possibilities of man going back to the condition of the pre one			
word had 			
Because uh after the saviour redeemed mankind over a period			
of time man has succumbed to evil forces 			
Wherever man goes he carries the seeds of evil with him 			
Man is corrupt and whatever he touches is corrupted			
So this was the broad belief and uh instead of the new			
Maseih America itself provided the image of the new garden of Eden			
After uh Jesus got back the Paradise that was lost because of			
stone passion crusification and sacrifice here was another great			
opportunity so they wanted to transform America into a new garden of Eden			
So this was the bold possibilities that they envisaged in			
America they thought there was a glorious opportunity for a new beginning 			
So all the literature reflect the search of perception 			
A new opportunity and with an advance fall with two words 			
until a greater man redeemed us but even the sacrifice of 			
Jes of Jesus has not helped us			
Now they thought that America is going to provide another			
opportunity for the redemption of mankind			
So generally one notices this sort of a reflection in the			
early American literture			
Now thereafter one notices that uh we had the			
transcendentalist presenting their own point of view particularly uhm 			
Thoreau and uh Emerson but the speech that I was refering to 			
becomes a very crucial part of the growth and development 			
And one notices that after eighteen thirty American literature			
 acquired a new vibrancy of its own where people like Whitman 			
Whitman was not trying to immitate the Romantic poets he			
had established a native idiom and his rhetoric was filled with the			
ringing world that the Americans had employed			
And it was transmiter but then it represented the new			
democratic America 			
So this is reflected in the Leaves of Grass 			
 and in the Poetry of uh Whitman			
I mean as though it appears as though Whitman was just waiting			
for somebody to give the green signal so that uh he could publish			
all his poetry without much of uh innovation and uh 			
there also one notices that the contemporary of uh Whitman			
particularly Hawthorne and Melville because of their deep study			
of Elizabethan literature the Renaissance period they started uh 			
writing a particular variety of English employed many of their literary			
devices which uh had become important in the whole world 			
They were still tied to the apron string of most of the			
English writer			
But the great divide occurs when it comes to Walt uh Mark			
Twain			
 That's why one normally says that Mark Twain is the			
Lincoln of American literature 			
We have uh a conferable frame of reference between what			
happened in politics and what happens in literature here			
I wanted to notice that one 			
If anybody has seen the picture of uh Washington the first			
president of the United States of America Washington is modelled after			
the classical pattern			
He looks like one of those great Roman Senators wearing a show			
guard and even the face is so impressive as though it is chiselled in			
marble 			
But when you come to Lincoln by no stretch of imagination would			
one call Lincoln a person built on the classical mode			
He had none of the Gracian features he was uh 			
homespun and homely and but then there was a certain dignity			
 It's like the writings of Melville and the			
writings of Mark Twain 			
So even in politics one notices that the balance of power			
 to use a jaded expression had shifted from the tide water region of			
America that is the east coast the Applachian mountains and the the			
New England region to the interior of America the river the Mississippi			
Missouri river			
So Lincoln came from Ohio			
He spent most of his time in that particular region the heart			
of uh America			
Whereas the earlier presidents they came from the old			
aristocratic patricians families of Virginia or New York			
So in political terms balance of power has shifted from the New			
England region to the heart of America			
America was still expanding westward California had to be populated			
 the gold rush had to take place later on 			
The so called resting movement had not taken place by that time			
And uh one notices that Lincoln became the president			
possibly the most important president in the United States of America who			
 brought about lots of changes and the civil war took place and uh 			
emancipation of the Negros also took place			
So all these things gave rise to a particular culture that was			
rooted in the uhm genius of the people the indigenous genius of			
the Americans 			
So in literature and in politics this sort of a influence is uh			
discernable			
And uh one would notice a similar thing happening because I			
started uh refering to Indian writing in English when you come to our			
own uh uh literature that is written in English one notices that uh 			
after Macaulay's Minute particularly in Bengal I have been			
pressing this thesis I don't know whether uh it's acceptable or			
whether it is well received or not 			
In Bengal which is one of the oldest provinces of the			
British Raj one notices that there is a simultaneous movement of			
uh what I call as uh both the Reformation and the Renaissance 			
Renaissance in literature Reformation in religious aspects			
Mainly because uh people like Raja Ram Mohan Roy and the other			
 who are acutely conscious of the decadent aspects of Hinduism 			
consciously they thought many of the good things from Christianity and from			
various other religious sources in order to bring about meaningful			
transformation of Hinduism 			
What were the uhm inseparable uh inadequacies of Hinduism			
 Sati child marriages and various other irrational			
forms of worship			
So one notices that uh this sort of a revival of			
interest in the ancient glories coupled with the conscious approach 			
to bring about Reformation took place there 			
Initially many of them underwent conversion to Christianity			
But then they wanted to retain what ever was residuely good			
 in Hinduism 			
And as a concequence they started a movement known as the 			
Brahmo Samaj 			
There are three movements which could be considered as part of			
our own reformation Brahmo Samaj in Bengal 			
 Arya Samaj in erstwhile Punjab undivided Punjab 			
 Prarthana Samaj based in Pune 			
So these I mean I'll speak Tilak Ranade Gokhale			
etcetera were all associated with the Prarthana Samaj			
 based in Pune			
So they were acutely conscious of uh various defeciency 			
in Hinduism and they wanted to rationalise an ancient religion and of			
course later on we had people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa although he was			
totally illiterate many of the things that he spoke were Christ like			
 			
My name is Madhu Purohit			
 I'm an Automobile Engineer I've done my 			
masters in Motor Vehicle Technology from Germany 			
Uh I would like to talk about the topics that are			
usually taught in uh the Automobile Institutions like Poly			
Technique and even now some of the famous colleges like B V B college 			
Uh they are adapting Automobile Engineering as one of the			
subjects for Degree courses 			
Uh I'm of the opinion that the topics that			
these people use uh some of it is basically wasted because			
they are wasting your time also and probably their own precious time 			
Uh because they teach you so many things that are not directly			
connected to Automobile Engineering 			
And in order to probably create or get the best type of quality			
of people that are there abroad 			
In order to get that type of people you have to really have			
subject concentrated to the subject that you want to specialise in 			
You know we have Electrical Engineer or Mechanical Engineer 			
who are taught uh the Production Engineering 			
And say in what way is production quality control okay he			
is going to be a design Engineer his job is to design not quality			
control			
It is upto each individual when he produces that part to			
see that the quality is alright 			
But this guy he wastes his time studying production			
Engineering and quality control so many other things 			
I feel that in Germany basically people are taught more			
direct pertaining to the subject 			
Yes we were also taught 			
Now I'm an Automobile Engineer along with Automobile			
technology we were also taught about Rocket Technology Jet Engine or			
say Gas Turbine but we were not tested as such 			
That was just given to us as a background so that if somebody			
talks about Jet Engines or Gas turbines or High Breed Engines we			
should know what he is talking about that's all 			
We need not have any special uh you know theoritical know-how			
and specification or any kind of thing like that 			
So that made it only knowledgeable 			
See we know of oh yes I know what Gas turbine is about 			
I know what these things are about 			
But basic thrust was on to our Automobile Engineering only 			
pertaining to those 			
And that is what I was talking or rather telling these people			
that we should adapt more of that type of technology where in we can			
get better types of people 			
They need not then wait for gathering experience in some			
Automobile Industry or whatever 			
They need they could be immediately absorbed during their			
 for their work the type of work they want to 			
While as now here we have Automobile Engineers or			
Mechanical Engineers they just taken in as Engineers and they don't know			
much about practical aspects 			
For that matter they don't even know much about theoritical aspects			
 because what happens is uh the theory is so res so			
restricted to their own this thing that they have they don't know 			
here idea is the Institution place more emphasis on this type of			
 uh retention power you have not this concept whether you			
know the concept 			
They say Alright I give you these notes and you see that			
 you learn			
So and you know if you don't write these notes and write the same			
things what are in the notes you will fail probably 			
And this is the biggest drawback 			
People are not given the time and even the			
opportunity to express themselves the way they want 			
Now if I teach you something about one particular aspect I			
teach you the principle behind it 			
Now if the principle is known you can always explain back			
phenomenon about that particular principle to anybody in any way you			
like as long as you bring the gist of the subject 			
And that is what you require 			
Now I ask these boys who have done their diplomas and all that 			
okay what do you understand by this			
Yes we had learnt it I do not know what it is 			
See because they are lacking that definition because they have			
learnt it only as a definition they have not learnt it as a theory as			
 a concept 			
And it is so shocking you know now people who came here I was			
 I had the opportunity of giving a lecture in K H K about four			
times and there was a course for training the trainer 			
So those people who are already training other people I had to			
go and give a talk to them 			
And I asked them casually how you know you will talk about Engine			
 Four Stroke Engine what is the Four Stroke Engine ?			
Can anyone of you tell me what a Four Stroke Engine is ?			
And you'll be surprised not a single man was able to			
tell what a Four Stroke Engine 			
And they are all Automobile Engineers 			
So what we lack is basics 			
People like to draw graphs that is something if you meet an			
Engineer he will suddenly draw a graph 			
He says This is the talk and no power graph this			
is this graph 			
They are so much into this graphs and which is not necessary			
 they should know what basics is 			
Now we have somebody selling Maruti eight hundred 			
What is this eight hundred ?			
I don't know 			
So this is what is required that we need to do it our people			
should be given basic idea about all these then you go into details fine			
When somebody asks you know if my mother asks me a four stroke four			
stroke what is this all ?			
I should be able to tell my mother who knows nothing about			
technical stuff 			
If I can tell her what a Four Stroke Engine is and if she			
understands that is the way you should teach somebody			
Because all of them are novice 			
If you are teaching some technical student then I can afford			
to give them some kind of a technical definition because if I say			
 For every two revolution there is one power stroke 			
only a technician will understand probably what I am trying to say 			
If you are a non technical person if I tell you this it will			
mean nothing to you and this is what this is what will happen to			
students if you tell them this 			
They only learn this what I have told them okay our teacher			
has given our lecturer has given this if I write this I'll get			
full marks 			
Now this is bad 			
What we have to do is come down to basics teach them basics 			
So the subjects also that are chosen should be related			
directly related to the subject			
There are thing that the students are may be Mechanical			
Engineering Electrical Engineering or Design Engineering whatever 			
So it is very important that we also have those kind of subject			
in oriental 			
Then we have some people say What is the you know			
 future for an Automobile Engineer 			
You see we are looked down upon by the society at large 			
Yeah I do not know really I'm also puzzled now how to			
really change this thinking because people here basica 			
 especially in small cities like Dharwad 			
When somebody says Automobile Engineer they really don't			
know much about it 			
And then they feel okay Automobile Engineer means somebody			
who does not have brains up there 			
Somebody who is not fit for anything or any other profession he			
has to be an Automobile Engineer this is the understanding 			
And how wrong they are because now the Automobile field is			
becoming so sophisticated 			
Unfortunately we are about fifty years behind in our Automobile			
field here in India 			
But with the finance minister uh 			
Man Mohan Singh plans you know for reducing tax or you know giving			
free trade uh facilities to our business people probably we are			
getting in some new technology 			
And with the help of these tech these these newer			
technologies the cars are going to be so sophisticated that an ordinary			
man who used to think okay this is my thing you know that set up			
something on the roadside and do it he will be absolutely nowhere			
because he will not know what to do with these vehicles 			
And only a person who has educational or lot of an			
intellectual person with educational background in that particular field			
will be able to tackle this job henceforth 			
So but it is so difficult to tell now like you are			
there or you are there now to come and tell them look I don't			
mind marrying a guy who is an Automobile Engineer because he is also			
like a degree holder like any other guy what's wrong 			
Okay he has to deal with car and he deals with some machine			
which you don't see 			
But cars you often see and you have that picture in your mind you			
know already preconceived 			
When you go on the roadsides you see some of these fellows who got			
no shoes they wear chappals some torn shirts and all			
that they lie down and they are so filthy from top to bottom that is the			
picture you have 			
And the moment you think of an Automobile Engineer uh this fellow			
also must be exactly like that and I don't want to marry this guy 			
So this stigma we have to one word it you know 			
There is a vast difference between a guy who has done his			
Diploma and would like to work as an Automobile Engineer than 			
the guy who is working on the roadside 			
So the social stigma has to be of course like they say 			
Charity begins at home 			
We have a to start from home 			
Take my parent when I got married I told my parents look okay you			
don't tell the girl what my qualifications tell her what I'm			
 doing exactly 			
Because I don't want her to get a shock because when I got married			
I was in Australia 			
I had come here only to get married and she was in Bombay and			
all that and I had to tell her parents and her that look I work on cars I			
literally I am underneath and I do get filthy 			
Because I don't want her to let me and say oh you are such you have			
done your Masters and all I had thought you would be sitting in some cabin			
somewhere and 			
Nothing of that kind because this is what happens			
Basically people tell something and there are some			
 you know difficulty sometimes misunderstanding somethings then I don't			
want her to repent her parents to repent 			
Things should be very clear but like I say We			
should start from home 			
My parents okay they know exactly what I have done where I			
stand and what I do 			
That is what each person should start telling his parents and			
his friends because this is the only way 			
If I meet somebody directly and I tell them 			
Look it will not appeal to them it has to start from home			
You know you've got better ideas coming from home you			
rather do things that your parents tell you instead of taking or making			
your own choice and saying I don't care what you think I like to			
marry this guy because he is an Automobile Engineer 			
No this will never work because we are so you know far			
behind still in these aspects 			
And that is why to change peoples attitude and you			
know it is very difficult 			
Attitudes are something you can't change 			
That is what I am trying here in my workshop now to change			
attitudes their thinking of regular maintainance about cars 			
They think service means just wash and grease and finish 			
Those people who come here with that intention in their mind I			
just send them away 			
I just don't entertain them because this is not a place only			
to wash and grease			
I have got diploma people here working 			
I would like to utilise them to utilise their know-how and			
tackle some mechanical problems rather than just waste their time in you			
know washing and greasing 			
I say Why don't you fix up some mechanical substance there			
is some noise here and some noise there why don't you rectify that 			
But they don't have that 			
Here we believe our Indian people believe in breakdown			
maintainance 			
Until the vehicle is running they just keep it running and one day			
if it breaks down on you then you think oh I should go to a workshop now			
There is no such thing called as preventive maintainance 			
That preventive maintainance is yes it is expensive and			
we do change or throw away parts which are still slightly good 			
otherwise they would have run 			
Then people say Why do you throw that it is still			
okay 			
So preventive maintainance yes if you want the down time			
to be less that means you don't want your vehicle to be you know 			
parked in the ga workshop for a long time because of non			
availability of that part or whatever because you didn't change it that time			
Now it's totally broken so you have to wait 			
 I've also wanted to enlist you uh another very			
important writer Margaret Atwood Margaret Atwood and			
Robinson they each together are very much nationalists 			
Nationalist in the sense that they have raised their voice			
 against the imperialistic dominition of their country 			
The situation is something like this cough on the one			
hand there is the imperial Britain from which they have not been			
able to see the a few words 			
So the Britain is the exploiting power the conventional			
 relationship with Britain on the one hand and America on			
the other side because across the border is America which is as			
well capitalistic exploitative society 			
If they don't uh bow or if they don't release			
them or if they resist the influence of the neighbour 			
then this is a very difficult situation 			
Resisting a neighbour is more difficult than resisting somebody 			
at a distance because you can't you have to come into			
contact daily contact with the neighbour with whom you have to			
workout a relatioship in which there will be co-operation and wanted			
or unwanted help 			
You can't escape the influence of neighbour 			
And the neighbour is another evil which wants to dominate as			
we have seen at the very outset that there was a clash of interest and ideas			
at the beginning which brought out uh two nation of Canada and America			
 cough 			
So America wants to exploit Canada capitalistically 			
And there is another type of relationship with Britain 			
parental relationship that too is very painful to receive at 			
what has Canada to do 			
Where is the choice ?			
Either you say good bye to your parentage or			
you say good bye to your neighbour or you allow yourself to be			
doubly exploited 			
Both of them are exploitative 			
This is the worry 			
And Margaret Atwood has raised her voice particularly 			
against the what is called the fashion of Women's			
 Liberation Movement that swept the whole of Europe some decades			
back 			
We saw to liberate the western women Margaret Atwood says			
 through her fiction that it is not feasible it is not possible			
 it is another way of uh self detention 			
The books which she has prominently written which			
are which have made her prominent are The Adable 			
Women and Surfacing both the books			
 deal with this problem of influence of the neighbour and			
of them of you know 			
The west uh the the women's liberation movement is			
 Europe's gift in which the women doesn't know what			
exactly she should do in order to be called a liberated women 			
So she is advised to say Good bye to all the			
conventions all the conventional morality like the institution			
of marriage 			
Again about Amphly and Clara the two women 			
characters in the Adam and Who have been discussing this 			
Clara is a married person 			
Joe the husband of Clara is always impregnating her			
 and then every time there is a child 			
And who nurses the child ?			
The mother only gives the birth the rest of the care			
is taken by father feeding washing clothing everything 			
His poses according to our writer Atwood is			
problem of father image and the mother image 			
What will the child think ?			
Who is the father ?			
The child will more likely answer a person who feeds 			
who cooks who washes is the father 			
Who is the mother ?			
A person who sits enjoys sleeps reads writes is the			
mother 			
There is a clash 			
There is the projection of the clash of values 			
The value system will stand changed 			
And our one word goes a step further 			
She says Why worry at all admitted that a			
 women's life is made unfulfilled until she has a child 			
That is the question of women but that does not			
necessarily mean that she should marry where is the logic 			
marriage is a social institution 			
It does not necessarily mean for someone to produce children			
 that he or she should marry someone 			
You can have the children even outside the wedlock 			
So you chose your man 			
You know one word him a child is born good bye to			
the man 			
The child will also mean I'm the mother my			
fulfillness in my lap to hell with you man get away from you that			
can be one solution 			
The problem will be the problem will be laughter 			
how do you know who is the boy you see there is a real problem			
If you are a woman liberationist and if you are a woman			
 you want to break away from all of the convention may be then			
you should actually prefer to be the mother of a girl child 			
This is what the logic is 			
But no mother no mother has ever thought of a child			
inside the womb as there for a girl every mother thinks of the child			
as he 			
What is this he ?			
Why always he even though you are claiming or shouting from the			
rooftop that you are liberated woman that you are no longer a slave of man			
The same problem of slavery man's slavery you			
have become over traditional in mental theory of the covention which			
accords greater status higher status to man 			
So even though you are a liberationist you are still			
thinking of your child about whom you don't know as a he			
It means you are still pining for a male child 			
This is a thought this is a very embarassing for for all			
 women 			
So our uh uh puts up this question to which there is no answer			
except that ultimately we arrive at a conclusion that marriage 			
is a co-institution 			
It solves many problems not only of the personality of the			
feminist but even of cohesion of harmony in the society 			
And thereby she seems to reject this wave of women's 			
liberation that has come from Europe			
The parental left 			
In such a theme she finds that a terrible mistake			
There seems to be an American in the pristine forest she			
finds that Americans are poaching Americans are there looking for			
 the wealth which they can exploit the natural wealth 			
So if they are boating in the lake the American is			
always interested in finding out whether there is a good amount of fish			
 which he can perhaps later how to exploit it 			
In the forest pristine dense green forest our 			
Margaret Atwood finds uh beautifully located huts over which			
the Americans C I A agents have an eye and they want to have 			
Such properties where they can plant themselves in order to			
espionage 			
So we can say that here is a writer a woman writer 			
who has very much identified herself with the problems and establishments			
of her country 			
She has identified but she has not been able to find an answer			
 and this inability of the writer to find an answer to the complex			
problems of two words full and neighbourly uh compulsion			
 which has created a very ordinary event situation			
 It's at the present incidentally is the hallmark of			
women creative writing 			
And they are uneducated they can't meet seem			
to know what exactly they should do 			
So this type of situation has attracted or marked the			
writing of the character 			
Uh however there is an exception 			
That too is a little along the line because we have so			
far discussed English speaking novelist writers 			
Let us go to the French Canada 			
And I have selected and talk for a few minutes 			
 I've selected to introduce you a very prominent			
French Canadian writer Premjeet Roy 			
Premjeet Roy has written a novel uh Where 			
the hen's will nest Where the hen's will nest			
 			
This is a novel about a very very remote area 			
uninhabited by the people 			
And there is only one family after traversing the land 			
crossing various streams and waters you reach a place where there is only			
one family 			
And that family is a French speaking catholic 			
And this Lousina the woman has a problem 			
She has eight children 			
She is an educated woman 			
She occasionaly visits uh centres 			
Uh let me introduce you to which we can call centres of			
civilization 			
She keeps in touch with the modern world in order to know that			
 the progress or the new I mean uh or the new things that are			
happening 			
Must be known to these people and they must not be deprived of the			
 of the latest only because there is some problem ?			
Is it because of me ?			
Uh uh I hope these external things are not against me 			
laughter 			
Can we do something about it ? interruption 			
So she occasionally I don't mind if uh it doesn't work uh			
 interruption but this will continue yes 			
So she goes 			
She has a problem of education of her children			
She is living as a family unit in a remote forest area			
And she is very much worried about the education of her children			
because the Canada government stipulates that's in order to			
 sanction a school there should be atleast six pupils 			
She has five 			
At present she has five and one is too small to be			
admitted or enrolled as a pupil 			
But she nevertheless writes to the government and they			
mercifully appoint a teacher 			
The first teacher is a Catholic woman 			
The moment she comes she endears herself mixes with the			
family becomes a member or part of the family teaches very			
meticulously 			
She is very punctual 			
She wants to take full interest without wasting a moment			
So one year passes 			
The education of these children for one year has taken place 			
There is a transfer 			
The next woman teacher is an English woman 			
And the moment she comes she finds fault with everything			
that exist there 			
She starts complaining oh what a stretch I have had to travel			
 I'm tired and I'm bored I'm as if in			
a in an undesirable situation 			
I feel very much unhappy here 			
And what are these people Lousina's 			
They have not provided a good accomodation to me 			
The food also is not palatable to me 			
The children are also very dirty			
They don't have good habits 			
She starts complaining 			
She complains and complains 			
But she stays on 			
And she's looked after by Lousina as she did in the			
case of the earlier teacher 			
She was a French here is an English 			
She does not give any chance of complain to this woman 			
But this woman by nature is fussy as we call such people 			
She is also transfered 			
And when she is transfered she realises oh the place was 			
not so bad after all 			
I could have stayed on			
Why have they transfered 			
The two types of attitude at the beginning and at the end 			
And Lousina does not feel uh that she should complain			
against the teacher because she finds the great advantage of an			
English speaking teacher being made available to her children because			
otherwise her children would never have a chance to learn English 			
particularly in the context of the modern world in which English has			
become a lingua franca 			
If her childre her children were given 			
education or instruction only in French they would lose the			
advantages of the world wide uh contact spread of			
kmowledge etcetera etcetera 			
So she feels that it's a very good event that			
 this coach as the British teacher have come and 			
she feels thankful to the arrival of these two teachers			
However the third teacher is a male 			
He is a French male a bachelor unmarried 			
When he comes he doesn't take any interest in teaching			
children			
He says teaching will take place afterwards don't			
worry			
Let me go to the nature let me enjoy I feel very happy			
 I'll shoot I'll fish 			
And he would retire to the jungle put a cap on his eyes 			
and sleep there 			
And he says education will take place we'll 			
see to that part of duty later let me enjoy 			
He enjoys he always 			
He starts calling her mama oh mama 			
mother 			
And he is interested in eating good things always demands			
this and that does not feel shy or constraint 			
And then he also receives the transfer orders 			
He does not disclose it 			
But all of a sudden there is a change in his attitude 			
He becomes very serious in teaching these children 			
And they realise that this man has a wonderful store of knowledge			
He teaches them wonderful things very advanced things 			
And before he goes he completes what he calls his course			
So there is no complaint 			
Lousina loves to have this man as a teacher 			
She says Why don't you stay on ?			
 Write to the government we'll also write 			
that your stay here should be extended 			
The man says No thank you for all the hospitality and			
the care you took of me 			
But I'm going on promotion 			
And I'm going to a place where I would like to make my			
career 			
This is not the place where I can make my career 			
So even though I love the place I have enjoyed it but mum 			
I will not tie my career 			
We will leave the narrative here and discuss the merits 			
because we find the time constraint 			
Now what happens is this Canada is a bilingual country 			
As I already said at the said at the outset that there are			
 language problems and there are nationality problem 			
There is a talk of separation 			
But here is a message from a French woman writer who			
seems to be advocating the coexistence of the two and not			
encouraging the separation or division in society in the polity 			
 He she seems to be possessing that English			
 is alright for the French because the French as you know 			
hate English 			
They hate everything that is English 			
They would not speak a word in French Canada if you talk			
to them in English 			
That is not acknowledged 			
So this type of hatred should cease because English 			
learning has its own advantages 			
And she seems to feel it that there could be harmony 			
in the society only if we didn't talk of the differences 			
At a party she invites she invites all the types of			
people available there 			
Hello everybody my name is Ramesh and I would like to			
speak about Indian Culture and Indian Art 			
First we have to know what exactly is Indian Culture ?			
Indian Culture flips the whole and soul of the the			
spiritual life of a person or the spiritual mentality of a person			
Now when we compare the Indian culture with the other			
cultures Indian culture is considered as the one of the ancient			
and the oldest and the topmost and the critical culture of the world 			
Now we should know what exactly is the culture ?			
And what exactly is the art ?			
Culture as far as India is concerned is a way of			
life 			
But the way we are culturing it now that is totally			
we are going in a different concept 			
That culture is totally apart from the culture what I'm			
 going to speak 			
 India's cultural heritage actually it's not only			
one of the most ancient but it is also one of the most extensive and			
varied 			
Uh tu it has contributed uh throughout the			
ages many races and people uh who have either temporarily come			
into contact with India or have permanently settled within her borders			
 joining the lines of her children and helping to evolve a distinctive			
Indian culture 			
The key note of which is synthesis on the bases of the eternal			
values 			
Now it gives us glimpses of Vedic Civilisation that			
Indian Culture which is having a history of four thousand more than			
four thousand years ago that is including Indus Valley Civilisation			
Now the Indian culture was laid and of the China the Buddhist			
movements which tried to spread their accumulated spiritual wealth among the			
masses and classes of the country 			
That actually is the foundation of the uh two great ideals of			
India that is synthesis of culture and spiritual regeneration of a man			
Uh it have has been uh truely			
laid in these early phases from which the future structure of India's			
 culture has been raised 			
As a matter of fact uhn the great culture of India is basically			
a synthesis 			
You know a synthesis of not only blood and race but also uh			
speech and uh what uh we can say the ways of thinking of			
which their different speeches are outward expressions as well as the			
 cultures that is material culture and intellectual culture and 			
spiritual which gives ideologies and determine attitudes and actions 			
The uh geographical background actually it uh 			
it it should also be taken into consideration 			
because man in any area any area of the world is the product of as much			
of his geographical and economic environment as of his racial and			
cultural bearings and movings 			
No culture or civilisation now this is actually going to be a			
important point whenever we speak of culture this is going to be a very			
very important point 			
No culture or civilisation have come into being in any country			
and at any age in a completed and a perfected form 			
Like an Athena coming out of full grown and fully armed from the			
head of the divinity vision 			
You know that's a actually a story 			
Now man is for ever becoming and like all things within and uh			
 his affairs are ever in a state of flux 			
Uhm now let us come to let us jurisdict ourselves to			
India 			
Uh India some would prefer to describe it in other way as the			
expression of a basic and original univa uni uh what do you call			
it as uh the universal uh unity in its various uh uhm we			
can say it as manifestations 			
This other way of looking at the matter has something			
attractive in it for those who believe in a progressive uh degeneration			
from a golden age of their imagination rather than in the in uh 			
evolution through the ages 			
But in fact in the face of the observed facts it is a case			
of unity gradually becoming established out of diverse and uh contending			
elements 			
Uhm and the first human habi habitants			
 of India that actually they represented various different			
races whose origins and whose language and basic cultures when started			
were different from each other 			
It was not totally a different uh altogether from square one			
It is from differnt squares 			
Now let us come to the evolution of Indian way of life 			
Here this Indian way of life is totally the foundation of			
this Indian way of life is totally Indian culture 			
Now the uh as a matter of fact considering the vast			
amount of uh uh what literally we say it is uh like your name			
in our knowledge of India 			
In the formative period of our culture it will not be possible			
for us to obtain the full picture out of a welter of race and movements			
 and of the ideological exchanges for mens and uh we can only			
see dimly the gradual establishment of a way of thought know and the way			
of life that we can associate it with india uh as a distinct entity among			
geographical units and uh you know human innocence 			
The various races follow each other as a face to sequence that			
is making ultimately for that richness of life and experience and			
thought and spiritual prospective that are in the civilisation and the			
culture and uh uh the basic uh ethics of India 			
The neolithical negroids from Africa the protoastroloids and			
 ostroids people and probably if may know that is from Asia and the			
mongoloids from Far East 			
No but congeries of Asian peoples who appear to have			
brought the dravidian language and culture to India and			
Indo-Europeans in their various elements racial and linguistic uh all			
these things counts a lot 			
Now Indian way of life as it emerged with a birth of the Indian man			
 I'm I'm specifing here Indian man which took place as the			
result of uhm uhm what uh they say that uh the mythology and uh			
 histories of the India at the time of the Aryans that is 			
the mongoloids the ostroids and the dravidians and Indo-Aryans and the			
Indo-Europeans 			
This this is going to be a very very huge list 			
Now the second half of the second millenium that is B C it			
was the period of large scale tribal movements and racial one word 			
 throughout the whole of the near East 			
In the as far as Indian culture is concerned I wanted to			
tell you one thing that is excuse me that is exactly based			
on the the Vedas and the Upanishads			
 and uh philosophical concepts of life 			
Uh in a well known Rigvedic hymn that is describing the			
battle fought by the Indo-Aryan king Surdas with uh the confederacy			
of ten kings one word 			
Actually they were uh a love people 			
Harikrishna Dev he is one of the well known philo 			
 philosophers and culturist 			
He said he had suggested with great plausibility that the			
tribes mentioned in the Rigveda were the same as those mentioned in the			
Egyptian documents 			
And uh this would suggest that external influences from the			
near East was not absent even in the ancient period of India's 			
emergence as a characterised cultural unit 			
And uhm this person Harikrishna Dev would identify			
the farmer with the people known to Egyptians as uhm the Purasati			
who were the same as the uh Philistines and Palistines 			
And uh that's convincing but nevertheless noteworthy			
 in uh these proposals to identify some king mentioned in uh 			
Shatpata Brahman 			
Now all this all this why I'm mentioning the Sanskrit			
names is totally based on the Indian culture 			
Indian culture actually these all these names what I'm			
 speaking of that is all its each and every brick of our Indian			
culture you know it's a dream house 			
Now until recently it was generally admitted that Vedic			
Sanskrit was the oldest Indo-Aryan language as far as the Indian culture was			
concerned 			
Uh later finally the Hitite question came before us 			
that uh and it is now admitted that the discovery and the reading of			
the language of the Hitites has brought forth the history of the			
Indo-European and the earl earlier 			
visitor 			
This would make the ancient Greek language interior to the 			
Vedic by atleast a couple of countries 			
So by observing all these things we can come to a			
conclusion that Indian culture actually it was not brought up on			
its own it was brought up through the the influences 			
through the the way of thinking of the other cultures 			
That means we may come to know that before Indian culture			
 there were some more countries who were who have developed			
their own cultures and their own systems and their own way of life and			
their own uh way of thinking their own way of uh expressing			
themselves 			
Now we will look at the universal ideals of Indian culture 			
Now we should look upon the pilgrims programmes of humanity as			
being essentially one in this great question of uh which mankind has			
undertaken 			
Ever since man became conscious of his intellectual heritage 			
India in its own way has made a contri great contribution 			
in formulating this contribution of India 			
From the very fact that its genesis are the people its			
genesis as a people I am specifying here India has had to take note			
of the thoughts and ideas and actions and behaviours of so many			
different people so many and uh take note of them sympathetic and uh 			
what we can say that uh you know uh all embracing spirit that			
would be the the better word all embracing spirit			
That means it is the spirit which which welcomes all the			
cultures and all the concepts all the way of life 			
And that is what it has that is what has given the basic tone			
or colour to the uh uh culture of India as representing a great			
synthesis 			
So this synthesis word actually I have already mentioned that			
Indian culture it is the synthesis 			
And it is philosophical as well as spiritual and mystical			
synthesis as well as practical expression of which is the sum			
total of the all the philosophy which developed in India with the			
great ideals of uh the Vedas and the Upanishads and looming in the			
background and uh even forming the basis 			
The aspiration and the way of life as proposed by this culture and			
 and accepble acceptable to the			
entire mankind 			
It can be theoritically put in a one word form			
 that is uh a few quotations from earlier Indian literature			
actually I am taking this uh literature from from one of the			
 references 			
It says thus That which is is one wise men			
speak of it in many ways 			
Now this I'm specifying here that which is is			
one and wise men speak of it in many ways 			
And uh to refrain from all evil to cultivate that			
which is good to discipline ones own mind ignore evil cultivate			
graciousness develop universal love and do at your good to all 			
Now when we observe all these quotations we will get a 			
 very very very very clear clear clear 			
 cut crystal clear idea that Indian culture it is the			
base is very broad very broad and that broadness that uh broad			
single base and different buildings have been constructed and the			
different religions has have been constructed that			
different philosophies have been constructed and different concepts have been			
constructed 			
Now when we study Indian culture actually we should			
look at the geographical influence in the on the development			
 and evolution of Indian culture 			
Now I will I think that uh in studying the cultural			
development of any country not only India I I'll I'll take			
it out the general this thing the general country 			
In studying the cultural development of any country the			
importance of uh its geographical factors okay it can can hardly be			
minimised in the early periods of human history geography determine			
to a great extent to the that the leads and uh uh activities of the			
people as well as their thought and literature 			
Now I'll tell you geography shaped history largely than uh			
 as it does even today all over the world though in a different manner			
Man has been independent on the physical facts of nature but he			
has not been content to live under these limitation 			
And he has always driven progressively to break through the			
barriers placed by the nature 			
And uh history of India is uh no exception to this			
point 			
So this interplay what we call it as interplay of uh the			
forces of geography and human will and genius 			
Actually it is uh indeed very interesting subject and			
Now we'll try to uhm what shall we say			
evaluate we'll try to uh enhance the influence of Indian			
geography and the culture of its people on the one hand and how the			
challenge of geography has also been met on the other 			
Now let us come to physical facts 			
Now this physical facts uh which have uh directly or			
indirectly influenced the history of civilisation of India and it has			
been the size of the country and its comparative isolation uh 			
afforded by the Himalayas 			
As uh my guru is here I can breath			
more freely uhm 			
And he is going to record my talk also 			
Well I selected this topic E L L English			
Language Learning uhm we have read and heard so much about			
E L T now 			
Perhaps you may find it interesting and this is the last period			
uhm so I don't want you to be bored 			
So this is a new topic uhm E L L uhn			
not quite new 			
You know that second language learning and first language			
learning first language learning is at takes place uhm			
early in childhood and it is acquired you know 			
And second language learning takes place when we are adult			
So it is learned uhm			
So acquisition and learning while this cough uh 			
differentiation you know acquisition and learning 			
But here I'm putting before you a new outlook			
Even second language learning is acquisition like first			
language acquisition because to acquire second language is 			
to take an additional language after having acquired one language 			
after having fully acquired one language 			
So that's why we call it second language 			
Now what the difference between the two learner L one			
learner and L two learner ?			
Now if we observe L one learner we can very easily see			
 that even their proficiency is at very low level 			
Well they never hesitate using their first			
language for you can observe children uh you can observe uh			
around you so many you see persons even those persons who never go to			
school uhm especially children 			
Now if we observe L two learner second language learner they			
are mostly adult because if they are not adults and if first			
language and second language uhm if a child acquires then even that			
second language is like first language uhm if the child acquire			
simultaneously 			
And as we are adult we are more cognitively mature 			
Second language learners are more cognitively mature 			
They are have more metalinguistic awareness			
Well this is word this is sentence this is phrase know			
metalinguistic awareness second language learner 			
And they have more word knowledge say this is the difference			
between uh L one learners and L two learners 			
Now in learning L two we observe two psychological processes			
Now one is simplification and another is over			
generalisation 			
Now L two learner shall have this tendency of simplification			
Well he while learning target language or second language			
 well he tries to simplify 			
Well at all linguistic level like lexical level morphological level			
 even at syntactic level 			
And there are many jokes also 			
Now here is one example uhm from morphological level 			
 Two chicken many bird			
 well plural form plural form well is missing here			
 Many bird many birds you know 			
But many bird two chicken now this occurs			
at the morphological level simplification 			
Well there is no need of birds because			
there is many birds is not			
needed because there is many 			
Then uh you may take even the language of telegram 			
language of telegram			
Now this is simplification at the syntactic level 			
Well refresher course ends tomorrow I I don't know when			
ends you know laughter 			
But you may telegram send a telegram 			
 Refresher course ends tomorrow uhm home Sunday or Monday or 			
uhm whatever day it is 			
Now here uh say articles are missing prepositions are missing			
Well this is the example of simplification at the syntactic level			
Then well there are many examples of over generalisation 			
Uhn L two learners uhm uh over generalise it at all			
linguistic levels again 			
Say instead of using specific verbs like fly 			
run well he uses the nuclear verb like go			
 			
Now go is a nuclear verb you know it is cover term you see			
Instead of using specific verbs like run fly travel			
 etcetera he uses go 			
Well this is one example of over generalisation you see at			
the lexical level 			
Now where the morphological level I think you know 			
wh when you assess you see uh the writing of			
your students you may come across many of them instead of went			
gone instead of you now went gone 			
instead of children child instead of			
 children you know child 			
So this occurs at the morphological level uhm over			
generalisation 			
So first thing we observe in this L two learning is			
L two learning is not linear or cumulative 			
We do not go on adding the structures one by one or we do not			
learn them all at a time 			
You see this L two learning is uh neither linear nor			
cumulative 			
But this is somewhat U shaped you know U shape learning			
Now I will explain this uh unfortunately I don't have a piece of			
chalk and duster you know			
But uh I will try to explain 			
Well in the beginning when learning is almost 			
mechanic mechanical say the right use of the 			
right use of plural suffix s or es 			
 L two learner you see catches it 			
And in terms of accuracy in terms of accuracy well he			
 must be given hundred percent mark that is the beginning 			
But this learning is mechanic this learning is 			
mechanic mechanical he is accurate he learns			
mechanically as we say know parrot learning 			
So and then his level of accuracy falls down well he			
he begins to commit error 			
He begins to commit error 			
His level of accuracy falls down 			
And then again it rises this level rises so that's 			
why you know I said U shaped 			
U shape learning L two learning is U shape and even first			
language learning is also U shape 			
So first there is high level of accuracy and then low			
level then again high level of accuracy 			
There are three stages first stage high level second stage			
low level third stage again high level 			
Here this U shaped learning strategy U shape			
learning strategy that L two learner uses while learning second			
language is worth considering seriously 			
Unless we know how our students learn second language 			
no methods will be useful 			
We will never be successful 			
We will never be successful			
Uhm let me tell you once again 			
Well we should know them how they learn ?			
What strategies they use ?			
Uh what are the processes that take place while learning L two ?			
And this is very important process uhm U shaped learning 			
Now there are three stages let me repeat again first			
stage mechanical learning when we go on adding the structure 			
Second stage second stage when accuracy falls down 			
Now this takes place because once a structure is			
mechanically learn once a structure is mechanically learnt the whole			
system is again restructured 			
The whole system is again refined 			
Uhm whatever language proficiency the second language learner			
has it is again disturbed when new information is added when new			
structure is learned 			
Now the whole structure is you see renewed again 			
Now this is the second stage that's why the learner			
 you see makes many mistakes 			
He commits many error 			
Now third stage after restructuring the system again his			
accuracy level rises 			
He makes no mistakes 			
Well he well his proficiency level also rises 			
So this U shape development is very important process in			
second language learning because it deals with the error that the			
learner makes 			
Yes if we consider these errors then we can know			
our students or second language learner 			
But we teacher pay very little attention to our to our			
student to the error that they commit to the mistakes you know that			
they make while learning 			
Now it is part of their on going process of learning second			
language 			
Well making you see mistakes or committing error well it			
is part of the process of learning second language 			
And that's why we should take it very serious we			
as teacher and try to analyse the the error that they make and			
then judge or decide the level of proficiency uhm they they have			
achieved 			
Now there are two kinds of error they make or two sets of			
errors they make 			
Now first is interlingua error B B writing 			
interlingual error well they are interfrance error B B			
writing 			
And second intralingual intralingual error B			
B writing they are developmental error B B writing 			
Now these errors interlingual error are mostly			
interfrance error our see first language interfrance interferes with			
the second language learning and uh we we find our student 			
transfering you see the the features of their first language to their			
second language 			
This we can identify very easily 			
Now intralingual error these are the developmental error 			
They are part of the development of you see the student or the			
learner in second language 			
So here you know I say it is one word B B			
writing 			
It is part of the process of learning second language 			
Now interlingual error are error because of our			
attitude you know behaviourist or what you call see even 			
structural I call bahaviourist B B writing or product 			
oriented B B writing 			
And this is process oriented 			
Well here I have in my mind the teacher versus the			
researcher 			
Now for me teacher is more important 			
Now researcher may level it anything but we must be able to			
identify it among our student among the learner that they come to us 			
So we must be able to identify you see these interlingual			
error uhm which are the product of our view to language learning 			
Our view uhm towards language learning if our view is product			
oriented we find these errors but if our view is process oriented			
 if we think that learning second language is a process you see then			
 the errors are intralingual error 			
So this I leave to the teacher 			
Now here one important thing must be noted at			
every stage of learning the second language learner at every stage			
of learning the second language learner has his own language which is			
called interlanguage B B writing interlanguage 			
And this interlanguage lies somewhere between first language			
and second language 			
But it is the learners language 			
It is the learners language at every stage the learner you			
see arrives at his own language and that is his interlanguage 			
It is always under fluctuation changing because it is 			
part of the process it is part of the process 			
Now this interlanguage theory you see developed in about			
nineteen sixty-nine well is very important 			
Now it is nothing but an interium grammar it is			
nothing but an interium grammar that the second language learner			
develops or L two learner develops on his way to target language			
On his way to when going towards on his way to target language			
It is an interium grammar 			
Now it is in itself a system distinct from L one and L two			
first language and second language 			
And this is the language that we as teachers first understand 			
If we succeed in understanding this interlanguage of the learner			
 yes we will be a success well in what you say teaching the			
language and they will be success in learning the language 			
 Ou our own strategy of			
presenting our material asking them to do some task you see our way			
of guiding them will depend upon our knowledge of this interlanguage of			
the second language learner 			
Now here I don't say we fail we I don't say we fail			
 but well we we ignore to to some extent well we we take liberty			
to to some extent and here you see what I say we go away from our			
student 			
If we are language teacher we must make our best to			
identify this interlanguage 			
At what stage the process of learning the second language			
learning is now you see if a teacher knows this he knows his student 			
he knows the process 			
He will be able to guide and he is the best teacher 			
Uhm well in in my opinion a teacher knowing all the			
methods of teaching is not a good teacher laughter uh uh			
the teacher one who knows his student well one who knows his learners			
well is the good teacher 			
Then only you will be able to guide 			
If now there are uh many level given to this 			
interlanguage uhm I don't you see waste your time on it 			
But interlanguage is very curious you see how a a			
learner reaches that stage of interlanguage uhm is very interesting to			
know 			
Well this process takes place in a certain sequence in a			
certain order and this sequence this order well you may call			
acquisition order language acquisition order or you may say			
developmental sequence B B writing developmental sequence 			
Well this is psychological process and only researcher			
can know this uhm how how it takes place 			
Well we we teacher can judge it only by the results that			
we get from the student uhm but a good researcher uhm knows very well			
 how this process takes place process of forming ones own			
interlanguage 			
But this is not uhm formed by mechanical learning 			
Now this is formed by following this acquisition order 			
or developmental sequence 			
You see developmental sequence now uh I will mention two 			
well uh project you see undertaken and also completed 			
One was on interrogative and another was on negative 			
I think you know something about credit cards			
 			
The way in which a credit cards card 			
 is issued to customer and the means in which you can use			
the credit card 			
Basically a credit card is an unsecured loan			
 given by any bank or financial institution 			
When a bank is going to issue a credit card we			
say they have a strong certain capital base 			
We or bank's fundemental aspects behind which a 			
credit card company runs is the requirement of working			
capital 			
So banks can draft the fund from other departments and uh			
 that's how issuing this credit card 			
Let me tell you about the proper method credit card			
 is issued 			
See basically as I told tell you it's an unsecured loan			
We don't require any uh what do you call as deposit or any			
advances against issue of credit card 			
All the customer has to do is to give some documents proving			
his income 			
And we have certain criteria for procurement of uh issuing that			
 credit cards 			
 Let's suppose it's a salaried customer 			
he had to have a minimum gross salary of fifty thousand per annum			
 and thirty-six thousand per month 			
So this is for master card and visa			
card 			
We also have another card called the diners club card			
 			
So the premium have a value card it's about uh if			
it is a salaried guy he had to have an income of fifty thousand that			
is the take home and the gross of ninety-six thousand 			
So these are basically two views one is the verification view			
 and other is judgemental view 			
Who has taken unsecured loan we have to verify as to the genuinity			
of the customer 			
He might for all you know he might going to be your			
credit runner 			
So the person you have to pick is that that are really			
executives whether he is really capable of holding credit			
cards because the banks stake is involved in it 			
And we have cases of two words worth lakhs			
 of rupees 			
So the first thing that we require for that guy is to 			
fulfill our income criteria 			
If he fulfills that we have to fix some verification criteria			
So the first thing that we do is clear application 			
We have what you call as direct sales agent 			
So these guys go and get application from a major company 			
and uh big shop partnerships and all that 			
So as soon as they clear applications and get them signed with			
all the documents they are submitted to a certified public accountant			
He may call us metro city			
They submit all app or the application to the metro city 			
And the metro city gives them to uh C P I in Madras, whom we			
call as a noddle certified public accountant and uh that noddle 			
certified public accountant verifies after the completing of the			
application whether they have fulfill the criteria manually and uh			
data enters them onto the computers which are in the system and at the			
end of the day he takes down them as a dbase file 			
And at the end of the day he transmit this through a modem to			
Trivandrum 			
And everyday evening this transmission gets into progress			
And after this gets downloaded into citibank systems we have to			
convert it into our database and we have to issue the database upto work			
table 			
So we have to run certain programmes they are called odi			
programmes or what you call end of the programme 			
After all these programmes are run these database downloaded			
into our system 			
And next day morning they will be available for verification 			
So the datas here and the application will come in the			
next day morning 			
As soon as they come we have a process of what is called as			
moving an application to an approval stage 			
We have a different stage 			
Suppose uh uh applicant doesn't given give			
 his date of birth 			
It is a mandatory field			
We have certain mandatory field			
Suppose if he has not given his address 			
Suppose if he has not given his date of birth 			
If you suppose if he has not given his income we have a mandatory			
field which are compulsory for any application 			
So everyday a programme is run 			
And uh the pointer looks up these certain fields and if these are			
not fulfilled it throws them into a certain station 			
Okay			
And uh if this check is fulfilled it moves to another stage			
 where you call a credit scoring programme as such			
Based on the age of the applicant on his financial status 			
on his uh assets worth on the type of vehicle he own 			
owns there were funny fundemental tid bits 			
And taking all these into account a certain score is assigned			
to a customer 			
Suppose he fails to score he will never be given a card 			
And uh suppose he crosses that score he moves to another stage			
called a de-duplicative stage 			
So all you know a customer might apply once again he may be			
already having a card 			
And uh he might apply once again to get another card 			
And there might be a chance of fraud 			
So to rule out these cases cases of fraud we have certain			
programmes what is called as de-duplication programme 			
We have a database of around four lakh fifty			
thousand members 			
Around two lakh members and one lakh			
 fifty thousand applicant plus some one lakh in			
our work table 			
So our database or or what you call uh members			
 addresses and all these are totally on birthday base 			
So let's say these data gets matched against any of			
these 			
 Let's say date of birth or address or anything it			
is it goes to a certain status and any officer concerned has to			
look into it why why is it that ?			
For all you know me and my friend could have a same date of			
birth but we are different persons 			
So we have to look uh this is same person 			
And suppose these are different he has to clearly 			
clear uhm de-duplication programme 			
And after they cleared it it goes to credit verification stage 			
Okay and uh the credit verification stage is sometimes all about			
 the verification of the application towards its completeness 			
towards the income criteria and certain how it consist criterias 			
 consists of criteria which I mean the credit card			
 man may subcribe 			
So we have to look for all these things and suppose if it			
is fulfilled we move to a different status 			
And then two parallel process go on 			
One is the fiscal reputaion criteria and the other one is the			
bank verification criteria 			
Suppose uh for certain categories of applicant we have			
different categories of verification based on their deliquency and			
their past performance 			
We have a we have taken a from how these portfolio			
perform 			
And based on their performance of these portfolio we have			
induced a certain verification criteria 			
So suppose uh let's say if it is salaried person we			
have to perform our own verification 			
Suppose if you contact in a public limited company here the			
credit runner is much less you know public limited company			
We have to check for the person has he really applied for a			
card 			
You see the person who has really applied for the card and			
certain checks over it			
We have to check about a few words 			
Yeah he may cross that stage 			
And then suppose it is self employed we have to do a bank reference			
So this bank reference tell you all about the customer whether 			
he has any bounce cheques what is his nominal balance 			
So this will provide you valuable clues as to how he could perform			
on your account 			
So after this has proved being pushed the application get			
certain status and after all this is done we issue a card 			
As soon as the card is issued based on the source of			
accumulation the billing is done 			
 The there are five different types of clause of			
acquisition 			
One is the direct sales agency 			
The other one has got a cross road application 			
Suppose if he is already a diner clubs card number we sell him a			
 visa card or master card across the billing 			
Or when he gets the bill he gets these kind of application he			
is into the cross road 			
The third one is take on take on and there customers have			
been short finale 			
So he all the customer has to do is come and pick up the			
application fill up all this and if he fulfills the criteria he is			
given the card 			
And there are two three other ways in which a card is issued			
So these are the different ways in which application is closed			
So based on the source of application the billing is different 			
So as soon as these are entered a card is endorsed at			
 on the third day as soon as application is approved			
So as soon as the card is approved it goes to the customer on			
a second day 			
Lately by third day the card get endorsed 			
The next day the card reaches the customer 			
And if you want to withdraw cash from what do you call as the			
automatic teller-machine or anytime money A T M he has to get the card			
encoded 			
There is a certain uhm personal identification number			
which you give to a customer 			
Only that customer holds that number and on then only he			
uses that number in the A T M he can withdraw money from that A T M 			
So he has to get the card encoded in the A T M and then			
you can use the car card for cash			
withdrawl 			
For purchases a customer need not get his card encoded he			
can just walk over to any shop which accepts our cards 			
Those are called member establishment 			
So here he just walk over to a shop buy anything and then			
charge his card against it 			
We have what you call as charge list 			
Suppose a customer goes and buys uh certain products okay			
And uh he has to submit the card 			
We have certain enrollment for every merchant establishment based			
on their performances and their deliquencies 			
So let's say a jewellery shop is a high risk area			
So every charge that is booked in a jewellery shop should			
be authorised by city bank 			
So every time a charge come to a jewellery shop the 			
member establishment has to call up city bank to take an authorisation code			
which is an online real time system 			
So certain fields are looked for and the card number is looked for			
So suppose the card number is data entered in that 			
It immediately looks for customers account its credit open to			
buy and how much is the credit line and how much has he utilised it 			
And there are certain checks towards it wh 			
 whether he has any bounce cheques in his account 			
So it looks for very synthetic field and that either approves			
it or reject it 			
If it is a if it is approved or certain code is			
generated 			
And the the code is given to the member establishment			
He has to write it down on that stamp slip on his copy			
There are three copies atleast one to the card member one to the			
city bank and one to member 			
So he has to write the authorisation code on that card			
state bank submitted to city bank 			
I mean when there is an authorisation code the charge will be			
valid 			
Only in case of flow limit higher than what a fixed deposit			
has given 			
In case he has charges below the flow limit accepted by city bank			
he will not take an authorisation 			
He can just give the charge to one word and 			
submit to city bank to get payment within two or three days 			
The main reason why uh charge required to be authorise is			
because of the delin deliquency of			
customer,			
Let me suppose a customer has a credit line of only twenty-five			
thousand and he has applied sixty thousand and he hasn't paid us till			
now so we can't allow the customer to use the card and keep piling on			
the deliquency or the raise up raise debt getting accumulated 			
So we have to serve him certain point of time 			
So let us say a customer goes deliquent and his account is blocked			
here 			
When these customers their tendencies it's 			
normally to go and buy something above the flow limit 			
So when they go above the flow limit the merchant ordinarly			
takes the authorisation from the city bank 			
So let's if an authorisation is declined the one			
word of charges declined and in certain cases where there are more			
sensitive cases we pick up the card 			
And if the card is picked up from a merchant establishment the			
merchant gets a an award of thousand rupees or put on			
 it's depending on the value of the outstanding of the customer 			
So these merchants help about in uh quite a good way 			
And another way where we detect fraud is about uh another			
 sensitive areas where these customers go is to the A T M 			
So these customers go and try to withdraw money from the A T M 			
So what we do is we block his account to the A T M 			
And uh at the end of the day we transfer certain file 			
As soon as these files are tranfered to the A T M through a modem			
 any card that is black listed or hot listed in the A T M if it			
is inserted into a A T M counter the card gets wall out 			
You can never get the card back 			
The only way that you can get the card get back you should get			
reinstated or to get a new card 			
So these are some ways where fraud is being detected or			
is being controlled 			
And the money that we made is on discount that we get from			
member establishment 			
So let's say this is called the plastic money and			
everybody profess not to carry money and they prefer to carry only			
credit card 			
So we go negotiate with member establishment to accept			
our cards 			
What is the benefit for a member establishment ?			
He has a larger customer base 			
And what is the benefit for city bank ?			
We get a discount of two point three percent 			
Uh let's say a customer goes and buys goods worth			
 rupees hundred rupees okay			
And suppose the member establishment submit the charge to			
us we pay him only the amount less the discount on			
which there it is agreed 			
One of this that is some should know in the true			
 kshatriya spirit 			
So here is well provided paradise 			
So that he need not had any two words 			
And he could not even believe you see that is somebody 			
Shailender one word life he was brought up 			
within the premises of the palace 			
Gautama breathed all the sin that a younger prince should			
have 			
That is on the previlege within the palace 			
The father could prepare to see that his son never went out of			
the palace 			
Once he went out of the palace he would naturally can't face the			
scene the stark realities of this mundane world 			
He detected the suffering sickness decay and death			
For about twenty or thirty-two years it's not clearly			
mentioned Gautama lived secluded within the palace 			
When he came of age he married a princess known as			
Yashodra and he had a son also by her who became 			
came to be known as Rahul 			
Now Buddha was born with a mission 			
Destiny must have its own course 			
And it it open at a proper time 			
His trusted charioteer known as Channa who had been instructed			
by the father not to take the prince outside the palace premise 			
He requested Channa let us have a ride outside the			
palace to see the world outside 			
Channa he must break away the path the life of Buddha 			
He reeling to his pressure of the prince 			
He took him outside the palace 			
Of course his wahan a coach or riding			
properly on a horse chariot was going he found some people 			
suffering with intense pain 			
Naturally Gautama asked what is this that I see ?			
This is called suffering 			
Suffering due to various causes physical mental 			
psychological problems may be there 			
But physical suffering is the most notable one 			
That created impression on him 			
So he came back 			
Taking that impression within his mind 			
Another day when he went around the city Kapilavastu			
 he saw sickness people suffering from different types of			
diseases 			
Buddha never knew what disease was 			
So he asked his charioteer what is this that I am			
seeing ? 			
This is known as sickness disease 			
People are subjected to various kinds of disease 			
This is a second impression that Gautama had 			
He comes back to palace 			
He came over this first suffering then sickness 			
Then after a few days again he went he went outside on his ride			
He saw an old man tottering on his walking stick 			
A new sight for him 			
What is this ?			
He said it is called old age 			
And everyone is subject to this old age 			
The lone and sinister old age they may be young people who			
would have a difficult match but normally people grow from			
 Balavastha one word then praudha 			
then old age then dehant that is the usual			
procedure 			
So this is a third impression old age yeah that			
Gautama had on his mind 			
He came back to his palace 			
Lot of tremendous disturbance was there 			
Seeing one after another 			
Finally one day when he went out he saw a dead body			
being carried to the cremation ground 			
 What is this ? he asked Channa 			
This is called death 			
Everyone is one word died none can escape death			
What is happen they should be either buried or cremated and			
there is an end of his physical body 			
So these four impressions suffering sickness oldage			
 and death led such a strong impression on the mind of Buddha 			
that he went and went back to his palace 			
Then he one word his life 			
I must find an answer to this 			
How to escape this four-fold 			
Transformation siddhant one word not			
be every one as it called 			
That to turning point in the life of Buddha in the life of			
Gautama 			
Finally one day he decides that he will leave			
 his hearth and home his young wife and a new born baby Rahul 			
In search of that truth which will bring solace to			
humanity which will solve the problems of this four kinds of			
 changes that every body is subject to 			
That night when he decided is called mahaesha			
 very significant word 			
He saw his wife lying on the bed took a last glance at his			
wife and the child Rahula also who happened to be the			
future prince 			
And left the palace 			
It is said when Gautama took the decision to leave			
everything in search of truth the Jataka stories that is the			
Buddhist scriptures bore ecstacies in describing this event of			
Buddha leaving the palace 			
There is mentioned that God rejoiced 			
Buddha leaves palace with his Channa that trusted			
charioteer to the forest 			
And once they enter the forest he removed all his dress			
the princely dress the outfit the princely outfit that he had 			
Handed them over to Channa and shaved off his hair and			
wore simple clothes ordinary simple clothes 			
This all is a very interesting anecdote 			
Channa returning to the palace without Buddha without			
Gautama 			
But then that was the prince's order he had to			
carry out 			
Then began the search for truth 			
Because he he was about thirty years of age at that time 			
Then Buddh uh Gautama left his palace he was about			
thirty years 			
For ten long years he underwent all kinds of austerities 			
hardships privations trial and humiliations mortification of his			
own body 			
Subjected himself to various kinds of disciplines physical			
and mental 			
In this context I must tell you that Buddha was not a			
Buddhist in the sense that we understand him today because 			
Buddhism came into existence much later probably a couple of			
centuries later on after the demise of Buddha 			
But at the time of Gautama he then lectures in religious			
schools the various systems that we have had from that on various			
 kinds prescribing various types of disciplines 			
So he goes to various teachers seeking their advise and			
subjecting himself to various kinds of disciplines 			
For ten long years but at the end nothing happened only			
his physical frame became emaciated 			
He was losing strength proper food was not given to the			
body for the maintenance of the body 			
Then he decides this extreme two extremes one we			
refer to from first term when he was brought up on the lap of luxury that			
was one extreme 			
So those important years he was also twenty-five years 			
Then in ten years subjected to himself to extreme poverty			
privation trials and humiliation the other extreme 			
These two extreme should be avoided that realisation came to			
him 			
In the meantime he was wandering in search of truth 			
search of illumination search of acknowledge that such a feat that			
passes or understanding 			
By the time he comes to Buddha Gaya now it is known as			
Bodhgaya 			
He two words 			
By the time he came to Bodhgaya he was about forty years			
of age 			
He had decided that he will give up this two extremes			
Then he followed that one better example that is			
given to us in the Geeta in the sixth			
chapter seventeenth verse A few words in sanskrit 			
Food and recreation yukta should be moderated			
 no extremes 			
Not over eating hence feeling all its energy in digesting that			
food 			
We know our experience tells if by chance we overeat 			
how much of energy is lost in digesting that food 			
You feel so lazy whole day 			
So long back the centuries before Buddha gave on the same			
 Shri Krishna has told us in the Geeta 			
Avoid all extremes A few words in Sanskrit he created			
in excessiveness 			
But it should be moderate avoid all extremes a			
few words in Sanskrit 			
Even in our activity intense activity should be avoided 			
And lack of activity also should be avoided 			
But moderation everything should be moderate that is the			
lesson that shri Krishna has given to us centuries			
before the time of Buddha			
 A few words in Sanskrit 			
Even in sleep and keeping awake a few words in Sanskrit			
This called yoga 			
Moderation never means what happens it destroys all kinds			
of dukha suffering 			
So by the time Buddha reached the present Bodhgaya 			
some of you may have glance for forty-five forty-three forty-four years ago			
 nineteen forty-three more than fifty years now I did go there it			
has developed much later now 			
Many new things have been added 			
In the last century the whole temple was covered by a big 			
one word 			
One English Collector of that district it is in Bihar			
 two words by name he just by chance he was escavating			
something he found 			
The tip of a brick temple and he asked these people			
to remove a old temple that is there in Bodhgaya two words 			
temple 			
Here if you view by the side or the back of the temple 			
there is we have a Ashoka tree peepal tree 			
Whether it is the same Ashoka tree that Buddha meditated			
under we do not know 			
It cannot be because two thousand five hundred years a tree cannot			
 survive 			
But its descendents it has also a very these are a very			
good tree 			
So when I because of sentiment associated with it a few			
leaves I brought from that tree dry leaves that fallen 			
So that was again on the same vaisakha purnima			
 day he reached that place 			
In the afternoon one village dame Sujata by name brought a			
little payas for him 			
Buddha accepted it 			
We should think that Sujata is blessed because she			
offered that payas to Buddha 			
And that gave him some strength it is called which had			
some miracle after years of mortification 			
After having taken that payas he comes			
to that Bodhi tree there was no temple at that time only tree was there			
He sat under the tree it's called the Bodhi			
vriksha or Bodh tree in English it is called 			
Some some descendents of that Bodhi tree			
have gone in different parts where ever Buddhism spread 			
With deep determination he sat under the tree 			
One of the most glorious verses that I have cone across in			
Sanskrit is this that Buddha sat under the tree with deep			
resolution having had taken that payas he sat			
under the Bodhi tree 			
He has an hymn a few words in Sanskrit 			
In this seize let my body triumph and my skin bones and			
flesh may be destroyed 			
First a skin a few words in Sanskrit let it be			
destroyed 			
 A few words in Sanskrit untill I came that knowledge			
 which is difficult durlabh it has never been			
impossible 			
Impossible means it can never be attained 			
With a difficult one word that is true spiritual life			
itself is difficult 			
But nobody has said It is impossible 			
 A few words in Sanskrit for beyonds and beyonds people			
have rights and then they have obtained until I sent that			
illumination 			
 A few words in Sanskrit I shall not budge an inch from			
this seat 			
This is the determination with which Buddha Gautama			
sat under the tree in the event 			
That is the story comes a whole night marahans			
 temptations of various kinds first sensation then			
terror they go side by side 			
But no yielding for any of these neither sensation nor			
terror because he had a mission to fulfill 			
Gautama had to become Buddha so he never afraid of every			
quarter change scene is changing and mara 			
became languish 			
And by heard on Gautama who sat under the tree became			
Buddha 			
Buddha means the enlightened one 			
He became fully enlightened 			
Now after this he starts for it is said in the			
Jataka stories that he got up from the seat coming round 			
Now as symbolically they have made stone lotuses as he			
came up from that seat every step that he put there was a lotus			
coming under his foot 			
Until he started going out 			
Then starts his spiritual mission 			
For forty years the first forty years with the			
twenty-five years happy luxurous life marriage birth of a son 			
and the determination to leave everything 			
And in search of truth for ten years hard rigorous spiritual			
practices 			
Then again his bodhi this illumination that happen			
 on the same day vaisakha purnima just exactly forty			
years later 			
Five hundred and sixty minus forty may be about five			
hundred seventy in B C 			
Then he went on preaching to people about this meaningless			
 it is a performing yagas shileniyas 			
Because at that time parnivantkas at your			
 one word they were spending all there energy in performing			
 yagas shileniyas 			
It is mentioned in the Vedas in Sanskrit			
 you have a desire if you want to attained heaven you have to			
perform yaga yaga yagnya did not go to heaven you have			
to perform sacrifice 			
But all that is meaningless much later thousand year			
later from Shankara lasting life refer to Shankara also who was also			
against the performance of yaga sheliniyas 			
It was more after the Upanishadic way of life 			
Buddha also comes to the same tradition same upanishadic			
tradition			
He was never against this Upanishadic tradition 			
But his whole concept that is vital core what he calls			
 Nirvan 			
He coined a new word 			
In our Hindu tradition also we have this type of 			
Brahma nirvana vrikchse 			
Brahma the highest knowledge it's also called 			
Nirvan 			
If attained Brahma Nirvan such a blowing up 			
because a kind of a negative concept but Shankara gives us positive			
concept content to this idea or concept of the highest			
realisation 			
So as he was preaching men and women came this is			
one notable feature in Buddhism 			
He made no distinction of caste community race or sex 			
Men and women are all accepted and became monks and nuns in			
course of time 			
Not during the time of Buddha but during the late 			
I will take exactly ten minutes of yours to brief you			
 about our institution 			
Many people may not know the background under which this			
institution was born 			
I don't want to boast about myself but some of my friends			
for example now my good friend Mr Leherchand Shah he has been			
associated with me indirectly for this school right from the first day			
 we decided to start this institution and still he has a soft			
corner for the institution 			
Whenever I request him to do something he goes out of			
the way and does it 			
Now he knows the background and some of the elder people			
 of the so called founder members of the institution they are			
knowing the background of course 			
In this particular instance we must remember our late 			
revered parampujya Gopalacharya Mouli who was			
the first person to inaugurate this institution and also blessed us			
And till his last he had his blessings with us and			
even in his absence our present parampujya 			
Vidyasimhacharya is at the back of the institution invisibly and			
he has been blessing us all along 			
Now we believe God's grace elder's 			
blessings always lead to success of anything 			
Building an institution starting your activities social			
work commercial activities anything to do good to humanity			
 whether it is a medical aspect or any kind of thing or			
religious aspect 			
Now this institution when I migrated to Mulund in nineteen			
fifty-seven beginning or fifty-six end there were some			
enterprising Kannada speaking people in Dombivali Thana Mulund			
 and uh neighbouring suburbs 			
They came to me they just requested me why not we start			
some Karnataka Sangha and continue some activities 			
I said okay 			
Any cultural activity and naturally in those years 			
before nineteen fifty-six Dharwar Belgaum Bijapur Karwar districts			
were the part of Bombay state and many Kannada speaking people			
 in those from these districts they came and 			
migrated to Bombay for education for their building up			
their career commercial activities came and settled down 			
They became one with the masses of the locality and			
they started their own activities 			
Naturally culture and civilisation and the tradition			
 in India differs right from Himalaya up to Ka 			
 Kanyakumari slightly			
Though we are all one so far as the thinking is concerned			
But the traditions in areawise languagewise some			
difference take place 			
So some people said we should maintain our tradition also 			
though we have migrated from our districts and come 			
came and settled down here			
Now we've become a part of this place 			
Of course I should say I'm here from nineteen			
forty-five 			
 I've seen the generation passing 			
Today some of the grandchildren or great grandchildren of the			
people who came fifty hundred years ago from Karnataka their children do			
not know even kannada language 			
But that doesn't mean we are not here on a linguist aspect or			
the communal aspect other thing			
It is only to maintain the culture and tradition 			
Each culture and tradition has its own history has			
its own good points and therefore we are only seeing the good			
points of the culture and civilization and not the bad points 			
Now for example he is uh speaking this language he is			
speaking this language I must hate him			
No not that way 			
Bombay is a cosmopolitan 			
Every language every caste every creed it is a mini India 			
And we are also a part of mini India though originally we come			
from some place but we have to maintain our culture and tradition			
We are trying to maintain 			
For that purpose only I agreed we started 			
But I used to see in those days there was only one			
Kannada school somewhere in a corner of Sion and Matunga 			
that too in a hutments military barracks running 			
And ultimately this was shifted to Wadala and I used to			
see young boys seven years eight years going in the 			
railway train all the way from Ambarnath Dombivali			
Kalyan and other thing etcetera or Wadala cough 			
So I said look if at all there is anything it is			
education 			
With the education we can bring up our people 			
or the society which has come and settle down here become a			
part of Bombay they will definitely be benefitted			
So why not we start uh an education institution 			
Everybody appreciated 			
Then we more or less decreased the cultural 			
activities of the Karnataka Sangha and started the 			
Vidya Prasaraka Mandala and in those days we used to call it			
Mulund-Thana because there were many people from Mulund many people			
from Thana even Dombivali everybody was coming 			
So it was Mulund-Thana that was the name given and we			
started 			
In the initial stages some devoted few workers 			
they associated with the institution and some of them were not still			
born in the institution 			
They were born a few years later 			
Now I can say Kamath or Joshi or uh Shastri 			
They came and joined a little later 			
Then this institution started increasing the activities			
We didn't have any place 			
So the first one year the institution started working 			
at my premises where I was staying in the balcony 			
And there was one teacher who sacrificed for couple of years			
 one by name Mrs Setlur she was a qualified teacher and 			
you'll be surprised I used to pay from my pocket fifteen 			
rupees per month to her to conduct the Kannada K G 			
Kannada first standard Kannada second standard 			
One teacher conducting all the schools 			
And we had devoted workers like one Mr Bharbare he was working			
in the A G's office now I do not know where he is 			
And there was another Mr Malagi these two people had			
sufficient time at their disposal being a government servants not I want			
to belittle a government servants 			
But when you've got your own shop you have to go			
right eight O'clock and open it and keep be 			
 there whether the customers come or not 			
But the government officer he can go at ten O'clock and			
come back at five O'clock so long he completes the work 			
But they were devoted workers 			
They used to go door to door where Kannada people are staying 			
and request them please send your child to our school 			
That some of the parents were uneducated they were not able to send			
Somehow convincing forcibly they used to bring they were 			
they were these two were the boys who were todays aaya			
 who bring the school children to the school and take them back home			
 that kind of activity they have done 			
I mean that was the kind of attachment devotions for the			
work they had 			
And this way the school went on 			
Then in Mulund in those days the population was about 			
thirty thousand 			
Fortunately or unfortunately I had many Kacchi friends who			
developed and we started one small social club of Mulund 			
Of which our Dr Lalan the first the oldest M B B S doctor			
general practitioner Leherchand Shah and some of the people we			
started the activities 			
And then slowly I rather converted them you know now			
conversion takes place converted them to devote something for the			
school 			
During this contact I came across the managing committee			
members chairman president everything etcetera of the Gujrathi schools 			
So Manilal Chaturbhuj Gandhi became a very good friend of mine			
Because of my association with these people and my activities			
 so became a friend 			
I requested him one day we are small people we don't have			
money we don't have funds we don't have workers can we use can we use			
 your school when you are not using without disturbing you 			
He said most welcome 			
Then I asked him we don't have big money to pay the rents also 			
He said who asks you to pay the rent ? 			
They didn't ask a single nayapaisa and then			
 Manibhai's all the children became our good friends and			
they also from that managing committee they looked after us very well			
 and sometime you know when our school grew upto S S C standard			
 cough the grown up children sometime become mischievous 			
They used to break the glass they used to make it dirty 			
they don't uh take care of the toilet 			
Then tear the paper and throw it somewhere 			
Now we were running in the morning shift and hardly there			
was half an hour dist difference 			
between their school and our school and lot of complaint from the			
headmaster of the Gujrathi school started coming this this this this this			
But let me tell you my good friend Manilal and his team			
of committee members they were so cooperative			
One day they called me Arey Kulkarni tum ek kam karo			
 			
Tell me what is it dekho tum ek jhadu wale ko laga do			
 			
Children make mischief and other thing etcetera 			
So therefore before this school come they will just clean			
it and make it good so that I don't have to listen to my own principal to			
coming uh I mean uh making complaint against you people 			
So this is a good idea 			
It should have struck struck the headmaster there at that time			
 but he didn't 			
Our Gudi was there 			
I forced Gudi to come and join this institution			
He was not willing to come because two reasons today			
we all of us look to security 			
Now our children grow 			
Okay what are you going to do ?			
So in good old days are you getting a government job ?			
Close the eye and join because it is secured 			
So private company is it a long standing then join 			
If it is a private company just started oh nobody knows			
whether after five years this will remain or not 			
So those were the days when everybody was looking for a			
secured job 			
Mr Gudi had already a secured permanent job in one of the			
leading schools of N K E S but somehow I succeeded in brainwashing			
him and I told him we may not have money we may not pay you			
what you are getting but we have a soft corner for you if you come and			
sacrifice and ultimately I had to cut a joke at him 			
Who is at the back of you ?			
He even today a bachelor still there associated with the			
school indirectly 			
Who is at the back of you ?			
For whom you want to have a a secure job ?			
Come join 			
Do some social work at least you'll get a good name 			
He came joined 			
Then all the youngsters team came and joined 			
Then we were on the look out for a place 			
And this Kamath came across the landlord of this place and uh			
we had nobody to pay 			
This man Mahalay had a very big land 			
So he was selling piece by piece 			
We selected 			
Do you know it took us five years to make the payment to him			
piece by piece piece by piece hundred rupees two hundred			
 rupees thousand rupees two thousand 			
rupees because we were to collect and give it 			
In those days what was the mode of collection ?			
Sorry to say some of our Kannada people at that time			
 were in trade in business in industry 			
I was a very small man in those years 			
I used to go to them 			
Look you are from Karnataka we have started a Kannada			
school we want to do this we don't have funds government is not			
giving us any grant shall we will you help us ?			
So some people who had love for education okay here			
is our fifty rupees 			
In those days fifty rupees was a big amount 			
nineteen fifty-seven fifty-eight 			
Hundred rupees was a big amount 			
Some people used to ask me are you sending your ch 			
they asked me point blank question 			
Are you sending your children to this school ?			
I said no my children are going to English medium school			
There was a Simpson School or something like that 			
Then why do you want this headache ?			
Better go away 			
Even people insulted me like this 			
So ultimately I came to the conclusion any help or			
donation will come from people who have if I go and ask them who do			
not have what can they give ?			
At the most people who have got a love for education they			
may give the sympathy 			
If they are elders they may bless 			
If they are youngsters okay you ask me run about I will go			
run about beg borrow won't steal but I'll get something 			
If they are youngsters who has a devotion for education 			
So I tried fortunately for me associated with a chemical			
trade in uh Bombay 			
I started only one aspect 			
This most of the Gujrati people were in the chemical trade in			
those years and I was associated with the chemical trade 			
I used to give them advice guidance whenever they			
came 			
They had a sympathy for me 			
So I said let me try to tap the source 			
So once a year I used to go to them with a small request			
And in those days for a souvenir we used to keep hundred			
 rupees is the highest for advertisement fees 			
And hundred rupees very few people will pay 			
Half page quarter page one eighth page based on hundred 			
and go door to door 			
Some people say arey jao tum pachas rupye leke jao			
 			
Even they would not ask for a receipts 			
I said no you must take the receipt 			
This money collected in those years was utilised only for			
 paying the salary of the teachers plus whatever we were able			
to contribute from our pockets 			
Then I said this way we cannot do it 			
Bhimsen Joshi being a very good friend of mine invariably			
whenever he was in Bombay he was camping in my house 			
Those days also like today his fees are fifty thousand			
 rupees 			
In those days he would go and sing if you give a good			
cup of tea at your house 			
So I used to request him and he said okay for			
your school I'll give you a free performance 			
And what I was in return giving he would come for some			
other programme at their expense and one day give it for our school 			
and we didn't have a big money to purchase the I mean to hire a big hall			
So we used to request the Poddar college Principal take that			
Poddar College hall and run this small show			
And to Bhimsen Joshi one and a half rupee ghuch			
 that's all was given to him 			
He was very happy and convinced and he gave us couple of			
programmes 			
Then not only that he brought that Ustad uh uhm what			
is his name from Benaras Shehenaiwallah 			
Yeah Bismillah Khan 			
He told Bismillah because Bismillah and he were studying			
together somewhere in North India sleeping on the footpath of the			
 Guru's house both of them and uh serving			
the Guru in Northern India and therefore they			
were good friends 			
He said dekho ye hamara shaala hai uske liye tum 			
phokat mei karneka 			
Of course we paid in those days hundred rupees or			
something like that to meet his expenses coming from Benaras and all			
that and that is how begging borrowing we started 			
Friends today I'm going to talk to you about two			
dimensional stratagrowth by identical limited aggregation by			
electrolysts deposit process 			
The passing century has witnessed scientific investigation			
 of order systems such as crystalline systems and so on and			
so forth 			
Order was even discovered in liquids like liquid systems 			
But during the last part of this century scientists have			
realised that many recorded systems behave in perfectly orderly 			
manner 			
For example biological systems are never crystalline and			
they contain more than seventy percent water and yet they perform			
functions which are most orderly 			
Many physical technological and biological systems 			
have been shown to be related to and described by non-integer			
dimension as called fractional dim fractional			
dimensions 			
A concept which was originally uh discovered and			
beautifully demonstrated by B B Mendel Broad in his classic book			
called Fractal 			
Uh lot of information has been gathered about these systems			
 such as technique such as experimental theoritical and computer			
assimilation 			
In this lecture today I'm going to introduce you 			
to a process of generating fractal aggregate that is			
developed in our laboratory 			
The plan of my lecture will be as follows 			
Although most of you must be familiar with the fla			
fact factual concepts 			
For the benefit of those who are uninitiated in this field and			
for the sake of completness 			
 I'll first give an introduction to the concepts of 			
fractal such as definition of fractal the concept of			
self similarity and their invariance the physical significance of			
 fractal dimension and so forth 			
Before going over to the method of generating fractal			
 that we have developed 			
And since the aggregates that we obtain are diffusion			
limited aggregate I'll introduce the diffusion limited			
aggregation of with an nth standard the module which is developed by			
with an nth standard 			
The first experimental uh evidence of different type of aggregates			
 was given by electro deposition process by Sauda Atoll and Gregor			
Atoll 			
Whereas the method which we have developed is electroless			
deposition 			
And using this technique we have generated aggregates of			
metals like copper silver and zinc which will be compared			
and contrasted 			
 I'll also show a method of how to measure the 			
fractal dimension experimentally for the agre type of			
aggregates that we have generated 			
The diffusion limited aggregation is aggregates are formed			
 by uh interspin which are very near to equilibrium 			
I mean very far from equilibrium 			
Whereas when the crystals are very near to equilibrium the			
morphology of aggregates is entirely different 			
 I'll give some beautiful examples of diffusionless			
aggregates which are generated in our laboratory from crystals 			
which are very near to the equilibrium 			
 Fractal geometry provides a natural framework for			
describing and understanding those form this according to Euclidian			
geometry are formulae that is to investigate the morphology of amorphous			
Now how to describe fractions 			
 Frac in general if you observe a particular object for			
example take a glass of water and a bucket of water where the			
mass per unit volume which tells you about the density of water does			
not depend upon the volume of water gratitute for measurements 			
Whether you take a glass or you take a bucket the density			
of the water will remain one 			
So in Euclidian type of object the density remains constant			
 irrespective of type of the measuring unit 			
But if you consider some different object as I'll			
 show here then the density no longer ramains constant as the			
size of the object 			
This object is generated in this particular case by well			
defined determinous to prove 			
A cross is generated by putting four particle around the			
central particle and this is used as a iterative unit 			
At the four corners and at the centre you replace every			
particle by the cross and you will generate this figure 			
And if this process is repeated several times then			
 a figure such as this is obtained 			
Now let us try to calculate the density of this object 			
Or as you've seen here since density can be			
written as density can be written as mass upon volume 			
So we can write this equation as mass is proportional to volume			
 that is mass is proportional to length cube 			
And in two dimensions mass will be proportional to length			
square 			
Now instead of mass we can use the number of particles as unit			
because number of particles will be proportional to the mass of the 			
uh one word 			
So number of particles in Euclidian system is proportional			
to the linear dimension to the power of Euclidian dimension 			
For the sake of simplicity we are considering a two dimensional			
system 			
And as you can see here in this particular system 			
Here value is at K 			
K is any number if this is K is equal to one			
Ah			
I have okay I'll just put it up here 			
So you have K is equal to zero K is equal to one K is equal to			
two and K is equal to some number K let us say cough 			
And I'll show you how it is obtained 			
So you will have here for K is equal to one you have five			
particles in this particular figure 			
So your N is five 			
For K is equal to two you have twenty-five particles as			
you can see there 			
So your N is five twelve 			
And so your K is equal to K and N is five to power of			
K 			
Similarly if you take the linear dimension that is if you			
measure this distance then for K is equal to one simply K into			
three that is three times K this and I have not drawn it properly 			
If you look at that figure you will see that this plus this plus			
this will give you this for K is equal to one two and			
three 			
So for K is equal to two we have K into T to the power of			
two 			
You can count here 			
It will give about nine distance three plus three plus			
three 			
And for K is equal to K cough we have K into three to			
the power of K 			
So in this equation if you have log of N divided by			
log of N to the limit A going to infinity then you find that			
this comes out to be log of five divided by log of N using one			
point four six five 			
So you see that the power of the I mean if you cough			
 can rewrite this equation it will become N into number of one			
word S to the power of some constant number 			
But A is unit here 			
Right A is uh you can take it uniquely or you can know			
even if you write A and solve the equation we get this in the limit A			
tending to infinity 			
So we find that this number comes out to be a 			
fractional number 			
So for Euclidian object you have a proportional to L to			
the power of Euclidian dimension and for a fractal object this is a			
fractional number and because it is a fractional number it is called			
 a fractal system 			
This word fractal was coined by B B Mendel Broad to represent			
those system which occurs the physical properties cannot be described			
 by using Euclidian dimension 			
For example if you take a mountain you cannot call it a			
triangle you cannot call it a sphere and therefore its			
properties will not be describable by Euclidian geometry 			
You need to take some other measure to describe the properties			
of such systems which are plenty in nature 			
Uh blood circulation system or nervous system so many systems if			
you look at them you cannot put them into orderly phenomenon 			
And then you require some science to describe such systems because			
the aim of science is to bring predictibility to events 			
If you cannot predict than naturally you can't have some			
 uh good sign you can't predict certain things then it's not			
science 			
So in order to bring predictability you need a framework which			
will describe the image 			
So fractal framework produce a provides something			
 which with which you can describe these events with certainity			
Now we should understand that there is this dimension 			
which is used and if we call as one point four six five is the dimension			
of the system but that is not the real dimension of the system			
Really it is a two dimensional system as you can see there 			
This term fra dimension is borrowed because that			
particular number replaces the dimension in the Eucli normal			
 uh equation 			
So we call a fractal dimension 			
It is not a dimension in the actual sense of the word 			
It is but because this fractional number replaces the dimension of			
the system to make the mea physical measurements meaningful			
 we call it a dimension 			
So when the notion of Euclid and dimension poses a conceptual			
problem in underst understanding 			
certain system the concept of fractal dimensionality gives a			
manageable and convenient answer to such questions 			
Just for the sake of completeness I'll give some			
mathematical equation which should not put you off 			
So in general if rover is the density of the aggregate			
at a point R and N is the total number of particles in a cluster of			
radius I then the density density correlation			
function can be written as here 			
So you have several forms of of this			
equation which I have written there is simple form U is equal to M upon V			
 C R can be written as R to the power of minus three minus three that E			
is the Euclidian dimension and this D is the fractal dimension 			
If this number is written as alpha then you have C R 			
varying as R to the power of minus alpha and fractal dimension can			
be measured experimentally by using any one of these cough 			
equations when different techniques are required for such			
measurements 			
Now I will describe the concepts of self similarity and 			
scale invariance of the fractal 			
Self similarity and scale invariance are the fundamental			
properties of fractal			
I don't say that scale invariance is fundamental because there are			
fractal in which the scale invariance is not necessary in the sense 			
the power which we saw just now this D distance need not			
be a constant number 			
It can be expressed as a power T and those fractal are called			
multifractal okay the common fractal normally I mean to be			
conceptually very simple the scale invariance and scale			
similarity are considered to be two important characteristics of			
the fractal 			
So in this figure which we have generated just sometime before 			
If you take any part of this figure and enlarge it then			
you get a figure which is identical to the start 			
 starting figure 			
And then again take any part of it so I have put it 			
Then again enlarge a part of this figure 			
It will appear identical to the original figure 			
And that is why the fractal systems are called self-similar			
 because the a any part of the system if it is elarged			
or contracted looks like the original system 			
But this self similarity ends when you start distinguishing			
between the particles 			
When you start seeing the particle from this take a small part of			
it and enlarge it it is no longer going to look like the like 			
original figure 			
And so this puts a blow to critical form below which the			
system will not behave as a fractal system			
Figures might be same			
No it is it is no longer a fractal system then 			
And similarly the size of the aggregate itself puts a			
bound above which the system cannot be called as a fractal system			
Because I may have a large system with sub units like this			
Now each sub unit is a fractal but these sub units might be			
arranged in crystalline position 			
So in that case I have fractal behaviour only between 			
the size of the particle and the size of the aggregate which is fractal			
In between these two units the aggregate behave like fractal			
 but above and below these limit they do not behave like fractal 			
And these are called the lower and upper critical bounds of			
the fractal system 			
Now in this particular case the figure has been generated using a			
 precise deterministic mathematical rule 			
But in general we make a fractal which exist are not			
created by mathematical rules 			
So in that case the self similarity is not exact 			
It is a statistical self similarity 			
As we can see here the object which are created for example			
by some processes like the smoke are self similar and here again			
 if you enlarge a small part anywhere here it will look similar			
to the starting object it will not be exactly identical to the starting			
object and yet it will be similar to the starting object 			
 It's statistical properties will be similar to what			
you have from the original object until and unless you start resolving			
between the particles when again the self similarity breaks down 			
So you have statistical or deterministic factors which			
are self similar 			
So let us see what is scale invariance of statistic 			
The equation M is proportional to L to the power of D sixth			
off the scale invariance because the in this equation it all remains			
constant 			
But the question we comes at to in this equation Euclidian			
 where Euclidian is dimension is used also this power remain constant 			
So what is so great about the invariance of fraction 			
In order system also you have scale invariance 			
This the importance of scale invariance becomes clear 			
when we look at it from the other side 			
What I mean by other side is that is if you have objects for			
which for the measurement of which mathematical equation cannot be			
written down			
You cannot define it 			
Then you cannot define if that means they are not still			
invariant whereas for those objects for which you can give some			
meaning to the one word are only objects which are scale			
invariant 			
I will give a very specific example of a coastland 			
We have all visited beaches that is sea beach I mean 			
And if you'll see the morphology of the sea beach 			
you will find it something like this it's not going to be a			
straight line 			
Now I'll take a one kilometre strip of the coastline			
This is one kilometre 			
And I measure this one kilometre length by using a metre			
long scale 			
I keep my metre long scale here and start measuring this by			
kilometre length 			
I find that my coastline length of my coastline is			
thirty-two kilometres 			
Then I take a one metre uh sorry one centimetre uh strip			
 and again measure this coast length 			
Again here there will be something 			
So I measure the length of the coastline as three into ten to the			
power of seven kilometres 			
And if I take one millimetre it becomes ten to the power of			
nine kilometres 			
There it appears as if it is not possible to measure the length of			
the coastline because depending on what unit I take for measurement it			
keeps on varying 			
But that is not true because the including coastline can be			
 statistically defined			
It cannot be exactly defined but length of the coastline can			
be statistically defined by an equation saying a few words 			
if we put one metre one centimetre or one millimetre you will get			
 L exactly predictable 			
So in this my last talk in in this uh Refresher			
Course 			
Uh uh I can't do uh in fact I want to give two talks on			
commonwealth literature as such but uh cough you'll			
 have to be satisfied with only one 			
And again in the in the department here there are people I			
mean who are specialists in Common wealth literature and probably			
 uh they will say something more uh concrete about uh			
 Australian literature uh African literature 			
Now cough uh now uh Commonwealth Literature			
 when it was conceived I think sometime in the nineteen sixties 			
Now I have one date here seventeen September nineteen			
sixty-five uh on which an association of Commonwealth 			
literature and language studies was formed 			
And so that's a a good date nineteenth			
sixty-five 			
But the very term Commonwealth itself the term Commonwealth 			
is uh quite an old one 			
In the seventeenth century the seventeenth century uh 			
uh the Act of uh British parliament established a Commonwealth company			
 uh a a comprising English England and all the other 			
uh I don't can't read in this or the other territories 			
You see they called it a Commonwealth comprising England and			
all the other uh dominions and territories 			
It it it's a seventeenth uh century uh idea			
 and uh the Ac by the Act of parliament this Commonwealth			
was established 			
And uh then in the eighteenth century Berk the great			
orator political orator now he speaks of the Commonwealth of			
 nations Commonwealth of self governing nations 			
Then in the uh nineteenth century I mean the some of			
the colonies like Canada and uh New Zealand and Australia 			
and So South Africa I mean they			
 uh became in a sense self governing nations of course under the			
 uh uh rule or reign of uh the the British King or the			
Queen 			
Now it's in uh twentieth century that uh uh			
now En England of course was a			
great imperial power with a power over quite a number of colonies			
 and uh to begin with uh it is a very comfortable imperial power			
 enjoying its uh rule over so many uh colonies 			
And uh the and the English people were very proud uh			
about the fact that uh the sun never set on the British Empire 			
But uh uh in in twentieth century in the first two			
decades or so I mean in all the colonies there was an awakening 			
and uh and the struggle for freedom uh started 			
And then it is as a result of the second world war 			
and also as a result of uh the the uh strong freedom movements			
 in the colonies most of the colonies became free 			
So actually India and Pakistan were the first to become			
free in nineteen forty-seven 			
Then in uh fifty-seven Ghana and Malaysia in nineteen			
sixty Nigeria uh sixty-two Yuganda sixty-seven uh 			
 Da Dangarika and Cyprus and sixty-six			
Malta Zambia sixty-five Congo and like that 			
You see so it's in the forty late forties and			
fifties and sixties I mean the most of the colonies became free 			
And uh so for some reason because I think the the British			
government was uh uh quite ap apparently			
 showed a kind of a generosity towards the colonies in			
giving them freedom 			
Uh though the the then freedom struggle were were			
become had become really ripe 			
So it was a kind of both both give and take you see 			
And that's why the the England had very cordial			
relationships with the colonies 			
And because of uh this cordiality the the Commonwealth was born			
And uh Jawaharlal Nehru as I told you is one of the great uh 			
advocates of the Commonwealth of uh the British colonies 			
And uh now it is at that time again the concept of			
Commonwealth literature came into existence 			
So I gave you the date as about early early sixties			
Now uh what are the factors that uh brought 			
all these literatures together 			
Now one of course is the English language and the other is			
the the common cultural relationship between the between the colonies			
and England 			
And uh one might say the colonial consciousness and the			
English language have were the two binding factors 			
Now to begin with I mean uh those who sort of the			
Commonwealth literature uh were uh people from Leads University as I			
told you yesterday 			
Now professor Walsh was the first person to write a small book			
on Commonwealth literature and in the introduction to this particular			
book uh Walsh says speaks of uh the the central cannon of			
British literature and uh these other literatures are uh 			
satellites of this 			
You see they are smaller groups which are attached to this central			
 area of uh British literature 			
So you you find in that concept of uh the Commonwealth			
literature a a kind of imperial attitude 			
It still carries imperial attitude and makes the British 			
uh literature as the central cannon and the others its satellite 			
But uh the the ca the writers in the colonies of			
course they reacted very strongly against this imperial concept 			
of uh Commonwealth literature 			
Now uh what are the literatures that came together uh			
 the Australian literature uh 			
Canadian			
And then uh New Zealand then African then Carribean			
Now in Canada a uh there are about two languages one is uh			
French and the other English 			
So half of uh Canada and uh Africa one word			
 Muslims uh newly educated people wrote in English so the entire			
African literature a and also for some uh pople from			
uh what country is it ?			
Lagose you see they wrote in uh French but they 			
whatever they wrote was in immediate translate the English 			
And then uh as far as India is concerned as I mentioned this			
morning only one tenth of our literature was represented			
Only that literature which was written in English 			
So if you look at these Commonwealth countries we find there			
are white Commonwealth countries and coloured Commonwealth countries			
There is Australia Canada New Zealand in fact they			
 they they still follow the European tradition 			
After all uh the Australians and the Canadians and the the New			
Zealand people they are Englishmen who went and settle there 			
And the relationship between the cultural relationship between			
England and the other these uh white Commonwealth countries that of			
one might say father and son father and son 			
And uhm now the problem was they wanted to seek their own			
identity 			
They wanted to become Australians or Canadians and New Zealanders			
So that problem was there with them 			
Even though the the son as he grows up he would like			
to be separate he would like to have a separate identity from the			
parents 			
You see it it is that kind of uh development that you find in			
uh the literatures of the white uh commonwealth countries 			
But if you take the coloured countries what are the coloured			
countries ?			
India uh and Africa and West Indies 			
Now uh India for one reason or an 			
 another I mean it didn't develop a a kind of			
protest that Africans Africas developed towards English			
 uh Eng uh England 			
Now uh even though my even looking at the Indian let's			
 take I mean uh each uh each literature I mean uh			
Australian literature Canadian literature or Indian writing in English			
 or African literature 			
Now even before they came together under one umbrella of			
uh Commonwealth literature 			
Now each literature had developed to a certain extent 			
Now uh one can say that each literature have			
 has passed through nea 			
nearly four phases 			
And actually it is in the third phase of its development 			
that uh these literatures came together under one uh umbrella 			
Now this is the first stage I mean that is during your the			
 the period of imperialism 			
You see the the there there was this writing writing in 			
in that writing you find that uh the British culture was the			
dominant culture and uh the the the culture of the colonies was the			
subordinate culture 			
And uh the the colonies in a sense for one reason or			
another yielded to the British dominant culture 			
Uh but this yielding is not uh I mean a very simple kind of an			
yielding 			
In the case of Australian literature or Canadian you find this			
there is a very simple kind of yielding because they were uh more or			
less the British who had just gone away from uh England and they			
were staying there 			
So before they started talking in terms of their own identity in			
the beginning they did enjoy this yielding or continuing the old			
tradition of the British 			
Uh but later on the second phase the second			
phase is a very important phase			
The second phase is a love-hate relationship 			
Now in India this love-hate relationship begins uh in the			
 uh early twentieth century with uh uh the Gandhian period			
During the Gandhian era one might say this uh tension 			
uh was at the highest 			
And the that's the reason why we have great writers			
during this period 			
Any period of tension or any period in which there is this			
love-hate relationship 			
So uh that period is very fertile 			
We have very great writers uh not only they did write in			
English but also in the other uh Indian literature 			
I mean uh who expressed themselves during this period 			
And that's why from one point of view that was a			
period of Renaissance for us in India 			
Even though we accepted uh a good deal from the British			
influence from from England uh we took them forms the the			
European forms the novel the short story the one act play and			
 uh three act play and all those things 			
But uh still uh they tried to express the Indian			
experience in a very intense way 			
And uh during the third phase the third phase is the			
phase that comes immediately after getting political liberation			
Uh that is political decolonisation 			
Immediately af that is followed by a third phase 			
and when I mean there is an attempt to I uh seek ones own			
identity uh and uh to seek ones own national spirit 			
and that's how a very interesting stage of development 			
Now it is a during this stage the third stage of the			
development of uh colonial consciousness that uh we find this coming			
together of uh uh the literatures of all these colonies under			
the umbrella of uh Commonwealth literature 			
Now the fourth phase comes after that say is is now 			
that uh the most of these literature are in the fourth phase 			
And the fourth phase is the phase of confidence 			
You see now most of these literatures they have attained in			
a sense their own identify and they have produced their own uh 			
great writers and uh now actually each literature I mean can			
stand on its own legs 			
Uh so I have a feeling that the Commonwealth literature			
 I mean in third phase they came together and there were there were			
number of similar problems that uh uh they were facing probably the			
 pha the problem of uh seeking ones own identity 			
And uh almost all these literatures went back to their past 			
their folklores in order to derive inspiration uh uh and uh			
 uh in one way or other			
In fact there are various ways not one way in which they found			
their own identity 			
But uh they found there there there they went in for			
various strategies uh in order to uh seek their own identity 			
And once having found their own identity now they they 			
they are very confident now 			
They are confident and the each has developed its			
own literature that is they now a a big body of Canadian			
literature a very large body of Australian literature and very large			
body of uh Carribean literature and also African literature 			
And uh now the Africans have become so conscious that they			
don't want to write in English any longer and uh they've 			
have started writing in their own languages their own tribal			
languages 			
Now uh uh I've a feel I I have a hunch that			
uh gradually this uh Commonwealth the concept of Commonwealth			
literature will uh disintegrate 			
Because the need will go away 			
There was a need for sometime you see united we stand that			
kind of attitude was there and uh no then we did a lot of uh			
 I mean uh comparative work and uh number of conferences meeting			
together			
But now we find that uh each literature has come of age and it			
doesn't require the help of the others 			
And uh they they there are more			
differences than common points now in the fourth phase 			
So I have a feeling that uh now there will be			
disintegration of uh Commonwealth literature and uh each			
literature will start just as American literature became totally independent			
 of uh uh British literature in the nineteenth century and			
established its own identity and now they talk only of American literature			
Similarly Australians have brought forth I mean big uh uh			
histories of Australian literature and now they don't need the			
help of the the umbrella you see Commonwealth literature			
They have achieved their identity they have their great			
writers like uh uh Patrick White who won the Nobel prize the great			
novelist and then they have very important poets like Cannis			
Leaser or A D Hope or Judith Wright and again they have uh 			
they're quite happy with uh their Australianess in uh 			
they've achieved it 			
And the they have well defined they have defined			
their Australianess and uh they're happy with their			
development 			
And similar is the case with the Africans 			
Now Africans during this third phase they did produce some			
great writers like uh Chinua Achibee then Ole Soynka then			
Ngugi 			
Now Ole Soynka well he got Nobel prize and Chinua Achibee is			
all he also became a world figure by his first novel itself the			
things fall apart 			
And so they have achieved their own identity 			
And now again their breaking up in the sense now Ngugi say I			
will no longer write in English 			
He will write in his uh Kenyan it's not Swahili			
but some other uh uh language it is a different name and he wants			
to write in that language first 			
And then translate from that into English 			
Uh now uh so they are all very now very self conscious			
about their Africanness or Australianess or Canadianess and uh now			
 they're very few points which are common amongst all these 			
Commonwealth literatures 			
And that's why I've a feeling that uh			
they will separate and Indian writing in English will become part			
of Indian Literature 			
You see instead of uh uh aligning itself with Commonwealth			
literatures uh it will seek its identity with uh other Indian			
literatures in other in native languages 			
And uh this is in general uh what would happen and			
probably what's going to happen with uh Commonwealth 			
literature 			
Now uh the the main problem with uh this Commonwealth			
literature was the was the attempt to seek ones identity and			
this is a very interesting phase 			
And Africans have went gone back to			
their ancient uh Gods and rituals 			
And uh uh the way they went back in fact uh is a			
is a is a lesson to us 			
And I would like to read for example some of the things 			
the way for example they went back to their gods 			
 It's a good morning to you all 			
Uh in fact you see my aim is to give you as much			
information about Indian English as possible during these two lectures			
 It's uh there has been a lot there has been a lot of			
work in fact you see done in order to establish Indian			
English as uh a standard variety of uh British English 			
So uh I will give you means in fact you see I'm 			
just giving you information about whatever has uh gone in for 			
the establishment of the identity of Indian English 			
So most of you know that uh the term Indian			
English is used to describe English as used by 			
the Indians 			
Uh there have been several attempts to establish the identity of			
Indian English through investigations into its major distinctive features			
Uh the seminar on Indian English held at uh C I E F L 			
Hyderabad in nineteen hundred seventy-two may be described as the first			
collective effort to arrive at some definite conclusions regarding			
 the status of Indian English 			
Now the conclusion arrived at were Indian English is			
not a substandard English it is not pidgin English it is not			
just British English with a few Indian spices added to it it has its			
own distinct identity 			
So these were the conclusions uh at which the seminar 			
on Indian English held at uh Hyderabad arrived			
you see 			
So uh Ramesh Mohan later on edited the paper published			
 the the papers I'm sorry the papers which were presented at			
the seminar uh with the title Indian writing in English			
 			
Now as the title of the book suggests the emphasis was on			
Indian writing in English only four papers attempted to describe			
 the lexical phonological and syntactic features of Indian English			
And one of the papers was by Kachru one of the papers was			
by Kachru 			
Now you must be knowing you see during the colonial days 			
Englishmen considered Indian English as a substandard variety of British			
English 			
Uh now for instance you see certain uh derogatory terms were			
used to describe Indian English terms like babu English butler			
English 			
Now you get reference to these terms in Yule and 			
Bernell's Hobsan and Johnson uh Hobsan and Jobson I'm			
 sorry Hobson Hobson Jobson it is Hobson Jobson uh which was			
published in Eighteen hundred eighty-six 			
Uh now Indian English was also described as kitchen English 			
and Arey Bhai slof by P Lal in his article on uh			
 Indian writing in English which was published in Harward educational			
review uses these two terms kitchen English and Arey Bhai			
slof 			
So uh so the means uh during the early days Indian			
English was not acceptable to the British people and uh probably the			
Indians even did not think of Indian English as uh having its own			
distinct identity 			
But uh the sustained efforts made over years by Indian			
English linguists critics creative writers and teachers of English			
have now established Indian English as a standard variety of English			
Now I would uh uh comment on you see Indian English as a non-			
native variety of English 			
Now some researchers or investigators would accept Indian			
English as a non-native variety of English whereas some uh researchers			
 would not accept some researchers like Daswani he would not accept			
 Indian English as a non-native variety of English 			
Uh now it was Prator who first talked of uh Indian			
English this I have provided you with uh select bibliography and uh			
there are references to some of the articles to which I'm			
 going to refe to which I'm going to refer in my 			
lecture you see 			
So Prator uh dismissed Indian English as a local 			
unintelligible model of English 			
So he said this is a local model unintelligible and uh 			
uh he objected to the setting up of the local variety of English			
instead of R P as a model for the learners 			
So he insisted that R P should be the model for the learners 			
and there should not be uh any attempt to present the local			
variety of English 			
Now uh Prator in fact called it the heretical tenet 			
He said it was uh it is the he said you see it was the			
heretical tenet that the local model should be given uh for the			
learning of the pronunciation 			
Now uh you probably might be knowing you see it was Bansal who			
insisted that there should be a local model a local model for 			
the teaching of pronunciation 			
Uh so far uh there have been some attempts you see but so far			
 we have not been able to come to a local model			
Probably it would be possible in future when uh the I C E			
project will come out 			
I C E project that is the international corpus of English project			
 which is now being carried out you see			
And the for the first time you would be uh for the first time			
you see the spoken aspect of Indian English is taken into consideration			
So later on it's quite possible the possible that the			
local model of spoken English would be uh presented 			
So Prator uh seems to have ignored the basic principle			
regarding intelligibility which when he calls Indian English as uh			
unintelligible he seems to have ignored the basic principle now 			
Now Catford in his uh uh article the teaching of English as			
a foreign language which was which was published in nineteen hundred			
fifty says that the concept of intelligibility has to be related			
 to the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness in a speech			
situation 			
So he wants that we should relate the concept of intelligibility to			
the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness in a speech situation			
Now Kachru adds to these to the parametre of the context of			
situation 			
Kachru talks of the context of situation now			
Uh so I I Indian English has all of you know			
 is used in uh socio-cultural context 			
It is used even 			
So Indian English as uh most of you know is used mainly in			
Indian socio-cultural educational and administrative contexts 			
 I Indian English has been used as a link language as a			
 official language			
So we need to take into consideration the context of situation			
Now uh uh talking about the phonology or the			
phonological aspect of Indian English it may be said that uh we			
should give more importance to the meaning rather than the noise 			
Now I would like to refer to J R one word book uh			
 Speech which was published in nineteen hundred and			
thirty-three and uh which was reprinted in nineteen hundred sixty-six 			
Now J R one word says that uh uh meaning is as much			
 a property of the situational context of people as the noise is 			
So meaning is necessary and that's why uh I			
think you see it would uh not be sensible at all to present the			
speaker of R P as the model for spoken English uh to a junior			
class in a village in India 			
Uh it would not be possible uh uh it would not be sensible and			
it wouldn't it would not be even necessary 			
Now it has been claimed that uh uh Indians need not			
concentrate much on the spoken form 			
It has been claimed you see means when you uh take into			
consideration the aspect of communication 			
Uh now it is said that uh the meaning should be taken into			
consideration rather than the noise that we make 			
So the role of English in India has been to integrate 			
culturally and linguistically the pluralistic societies within India 			
And uh it has never been the primary aim of uh English in India			
 to integrate with the British or American culture 			
American culture and that's why we did not pay			
much attention you see to the spoken aspect 			
But uh we should rather concentrate on the written communication			
So throughout the years Indians accepted English they			
acculturated English and uh the acculturated English is what we			
call Indian English what we call Indian English			
So this linguistic assimilation that has taken place 			
 in with regard to English in India may be			
compared to it may be compared to the Indianisation of Persian language			
 or the Dravidianisation of Sanskrit language or even the			
Indo-Aryanisation of Dravidian languages in India 			
It may be compared uh to these now 			
Bhatia uh presents four criteria on the basis of			
which he would establish Indian English as a non-native variety 			
For the first criterion about which he talks is that in			
India English is learnt from the school stage of education 			
So before uh uh before a boy starts before a boy or a girl			
 uh starts learning English he or she has already learnt the			
mother tongue 			
She has already learnt the mother tongue			
So the use of English in India has been from fine to formal			
 or sometimes even informal situation 			
But uh uh English in India is never used for intimate			
situations 			
It is never used for intimate situation 			
Uh so uh the according to him you see the second			
criterion is this the intimate situations are not the region			
of uh Indian English 			
Then a non-native speaker has limited facility to use the			
various registors of the language 			
So the native speaker can use all the registors of the language			
whereas uh uh Indians in uh Indians cannot use all the registors			
of language 			
Then as a non-native variety English in India has uh 			
phonetic syntactic and symantic deviations 			
So these deviations even would establish India English as a			
non-native variety 			
Now Bansal objected to Prator's observations			
Uh Bansal Bansal infact you see uh wrote uh in his 			
nineteen hundred sixty-nine article that the subjective element or the			
 uh or the puritan attitude which uh Prator had been			
representing in his criticism of Indian English was altogetherly wrong			
So uh Bansal tried to measure the intelligibility of Indian			
English 			
So he wanted to establish that Indian in Indian English is			
intelligible as against Prator's criticism of Indian English as			
uintelligible 			
So uh he uh came to the conclusion that uh an			
average figure of intelligibility between educated Indian speaker and R P			
speaker is seventy-three percent is seventy-three precent 			
So uh Indian English cannot be dismissed as unintelligible			
variety of English 			
So his study was based on a on recorded specimens of English of			
the Indian speech community and uh it described even the phonetic			
features of Indian English speech which uh differ from the R P			
 Bansal's nineteen hundred seventy-two study was an			
attempt to analyse and describe the common core of language patterns			
 the common core of language patterns 			
Now uh later on you see perk even Quirk talked of the 			
uh nuclei the nuclear English 			
He talked about the nuclear English later on Quirk 			
Now the common core uh of course uh uh one of the			
conclusions I would be arriving at would be that when it comes			
to the common core Indian English does not differ much from 			
British English 			
So this would be one of the conclusions uh at which I would			
like to arrive at the end 			
So Bansal wanted to uh find out if it was possible			
to have the common core shared by all the members of Indian speech			
community all the members of Indian speech community			
Now he said you see uh now of course you see in India 			
English is used for uh a variety of purposes 			
But Bansal compares the variedness of Indian English with that of			
human behaviour 			
So he says human behaviour when we talk of human behaviour 			
we concentrate on similarity and not on differences 			
So in the same way we should think of this similar uh the			
similar aspects or the similar features and uh that would enable us 			
to have a common core for the spoken Indian English 			
Now Verma uh describes Indian English as an offspring yielded			
by English a second language with a distinct Indian flavour 			
He would describe Indian English as one of the languages of India			
 used by a community of people at different levels of communication			
So and then further he says within the overall general			
framework of the basic linguistic systems of British English it displays			
certain distinguishing features and uh he would say it is the			
interlanguage situation that contributes to the distinct status of Indian			
English 			
So he would say that it will be interlanguage situation			
So his concentration is on the interlanguage situation 			
So Verma did not want Indian English to be grouped 			
with American English Canadian English and Australian English because			
 he said these are the mother tongue varieties whereas Indian English			
is a non-native second language variety it is a non- native second			
language variety 			
Now as I told you before Daswani would not accept Indian			
English as a variety of British British English 			
So but uh there is some positive element in his			
criticism of Indian English 			
He says if systematic relations uh if systematic			
relationship between varieties of English such as American Australian			
Canadian English and Indian English is established then only Indian			
English may be accepted as uh a variety of British English 			
So the relationship between the mother tongue variety			
 and the Indian English needs to be established and then only we			
would accept Indian English as a variety of British English 			
Now if you know you see uh Chowmsky would uh say that 			
uh the divergencies this when we talk of a language when we talk			
of a a a language let us say uh divergencies at the divergencies are			
shown at the level of surface structure rather than at the level of			
deep structure rather than at the level of deep structure 			
So Daswani says that it has not yet been proved that face			
structure rules of British English and Indian English are the same 			
are the same and that the difference is only in the area of uh 			
transformational and phonological rules 			
So only when it would be proved that at the level of deep			
structure Indian English is the same as British English and			
uh only at the level of uh the surface structure Indian English			
differs from British English then only we may accept Indian English as a			
variety of British English			
This is what uh uh Daswani would say 			
Uh Daswani also comments on the eratic use of articles and			
prepositions in Indian English 			
He even comments on the phoneic interference on account of			
negligence of some phonological rules 			
So we uh infact do not know certain rules and we ignore			
certain rules and that's why there is phonic interference in Indian			
English 			
So he would say uh he would say you see it is out of our			
 ignorance it is out of uh our ignorance or negligience that uh			
 we use uh different structures 			
We use different structures and that's why Indian English			
is not a variety of uh British English 			
This is Daswani's uh point of view 			
Mr Vice Chancellor Mr Narayana Rao distinguished			
members of the faculty ladies and gentlemen 			
You know the great advantage of being Chief Election Commissioner of			
India is that in the last few days and a last few months I have been			
able to achieve life long ambitions 			
Only last week I achieved the life long ambition of entering into			
the Stella Mary's college in Madras laughter 			
And today I have achieved the ambition of getting into the			
Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages 			
A kind of place of education academics and learning 			
which would normally frown upon any bureaucrats much more a bureaucrat			
whose name is synonymous with controversy 			
The Vice Chancellor has been good enough or bad enough not to			
give me a subject laughter 			
In the trade which I follow once I get hold of the mike you			
don't let go off it easily 			
So if I don't let go off the mike Kamal Narayan will show me			
some little symbols to show that it is getting late and that his blood			
pressure is rising laughter 			
Mr Narayana Rao gave you an introduction about myself			
He said many nice things he said so many nice things that I thought			
he was describing somebody else laughter 			
He didn't tell you that I wrote the S S L C exam what used to be			
the end of school exam twice laughter and applause 			
He did not tell you that I wrote what in those days days the plus			
two exam used to be called the Intermediate I wrote that twice 			
laughter 			
And when K Subramaniam taught me English at the Madras Christian			
College in March Nineteen fifty-one I wrote the English preliminary exam			
for the Physics honors twice laughter 			
So how can you invite a person of this kind of academic			
qualification to the most outstandingly academic circmustances of the			
Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages			
No no no I forgot to tell you I wrote those exams twice each			
year because the question papers had leaked laughter and			
applause 			
Nineteen nineteen forty-seven was the first time the S S L C			
queation papers leaked in Madras 			
Nineteen forty-nine was the first year in which the			
Intermediate question papers leaked in Madras			
Nineteen fifty was the first time when a honors degree			
preliminary examination question paper be it English or something else			
 leaked in Madras 			
So I wrote most of them twice			
I am not going to tell you my academic abilities because they			
are part of the history of an extinguished Civil Servant 			
I have been in bonded labour with government for thirty-six years			
from April nineteen fifty-five till December of Nineteen ninety when 			
in a moment of extraordinary carelessness the then Prime Minister put			
me into this job despite the warning laughter of a previous			
Prime Minister who said this gentleman will still live to rule the day they			
make you Chief Election Commissioner 			
He did 			
He did 			
Roughly two and half years later speaking on the floor of			
Parliament in February ninety-two Mr Chandrasekhar the former Prime Minister			
said I've done many serious mistakes in my life			
none has been so serious as the appointment of Mr Seshan as the Chief			
Election Commissioner laughter and applause 			
I have a feeling that Mr Chandrasekhar's feeling			
towards me are slightly less frozen now because more recently I have			
noticed the sign of thaw 			
You basically are a set of teachers teachers and 			
teacher's teachers and teacher's teacher's teachers			
And who am I to speak to you about ?			
What am I to speak to you about ?			
The Vice Chancellor to some degree and Mr Narayan Rao to a			
greater degree spoke of India and its democracy 			
When you talk of India's democracy you can hold your			
head up in great pride and say Where else in the world do			
you get the democracy of this kind 			
On the first of July last about two three months ago India's			
 population was nine hundred and nineteen million people 			
Of that about a five hundred and fifty million were voters above			
the age of eighteen			
Anybody who is above the age of eighteen who is an Indian citizen			
 who is not a confirmed lunatic and who has not been declared disqualified			
by some law is entitled to be a voter and he is entitled to be a			
voter in a particular place if he is ordinarily resident in that place			
That is what the law says 			
The law was not passed by me it was passed in nineteen fifty			
 when I was still studying Physics 			
When we run a full national election in this country we run the			
election in eight hundred thousand polling booths man by four million			
civilian employees at the rate of five per polling booth			
 We're going to shortly make it six 			
Why are you suddenly increasing it five to six ?			
Because we are going to have compulsorily atleast one woman			
polling officer in each booth 			
So that Mr Lalu Yadav who told the T V last week only 			
He said in Hindi laughter who will be a lady 			
 laughter 			
And Mr Lalu Yadav will not be unhappy 			
So I was saying We use four million employees in addition			
to that we use a million and half policemen outside all kinds of			
policemen state policemen state armed policemen state reserved policemen 			
uh state home guards policemen state every kind of policemen central			
policemen central reserve police border security force Indo-Tibetan border			
police central Industrial security force Railway protection force 			
laughter any number of forces we use one and half million policemen			
to run a full election in this country 			
When parliament run its election in nineteen ninety-one a few			
months after I became the Chief Election Commissioner we had nine			
thousand candidates for five hundred and odd parliamentary seats 			
But what an average of about eighteen candidates per seat there			
were some seats in which there were even a hundred candidates were 			
per constituency 			
In one part of India not necessarily for a parliament seat for an			
assembly seat in Tamil Nadu at a place called Araba Puruchi we had three			
hundred and seventy candidates for the assembly seat			
So that the ballet did not look like a sheet out of India's			
 todays newspaper it looked like todays edition of the newspaper			
 laughter 			
When parliament election runs in a normal course if there are nine			
thousand candidates we consume twenty thousand tons of high quality paper			
 and to each and every polling booth we reach seventy-five items like			
Alice in Wonderland of ships and shoes and sealing wax of cabbages and			
things of why the sea is boiling lots of ballet boxes and ballet papers			
and sealing wax and the melting wax and wires and threads and uh all			
kinds of things hurricane lantern if the Andhra Pradesh electricity board			
to switch off electricity don't worry I can reach you without benefit of mike			
 laughter 			
Seventy-five items are reached to everyone of this places not all			
of them are easily accessible to motorise transport there are places			
where only the camel can reach as in Jaisalmer or in Bahmer or in Sawai			
Madhavpur 			
There are places like not only in Ladakh or Kargil but			
also in Lahore and Spity where only the largest helicopter of the			
Indian force the mig twenty-five can reach those polling booths with			
the polling party and the polling material			
There are parts of the Sunderban's jungle were only			
elephant back will reach			
There are parts of the island territories which only a boat			
would reach 			
And thanks to the extraordinary good arrangements made by			
distinguished predecessors of mine I've had eight predecessors 			
I'm the nineth Chief Election Commissioner of India 			
Those arrangements are so good that they are the eighth			
wonder of the world laughter 			
Make no laughing statement about it 			
Hold your head high 			
Adult franchise was introduced at the point of time at which 			
India's literacy was less than twenty percent 			
Today gentlemen in-charge of education programmes in different			
parts of the country put out lie after lie after lie all of governments			
programmes are called crash programmes because they all crash 			
laughter 			
Crash programme in English education do you conduct those ?			
 laughter and applause 			
Crash programme in rat elimination laughter 			
Every crash every programme is called ra crash programme			
in malaria eradication crash programme in women's environment 			
everything is called a crash programme 			
But today at the end of all kinds of crash programmes literacy			
amongst women in Bihar is still about four to five percent 			
The Chief Minister will be angry to hear me say so			
He says It is ten percent 			
Doesn't matter I'll concede ten percent 			
In Haryana they say It has reached thirty percent 			
But brides are largely for burning still in Haryana 			
In Haryana brides are largely still for burning 			
If they don't produce a son they are burnt if they don't produce			
dowry they are burnt 			
Generally if they don't like the dau daughters-in-law they			
are burnt 			
First burn the daughter-in-law then ask the question 			
laughter 			
In their jest our fore-fathers the founding			
fathers of our constitution decided to endow upon the people of this country			
adult franchise that anybody who was twenty-one at that time now converted to			
eighteen in the last four or five years has the right to elect the			
government of this people of this country 			
When you talk of India you're talking of Indian			
democracy you talk of India what is the picture of India that you get			
 ?			
The picture of India taught to our children in our schools today			
most of you are English teachers you don't know this but go and sit in			
English class and the History classes whether in college or in school			
are there any History teachers here ?			
I hope not they will throw something at me laughter 			
In fact there are twenty-five states and six union territories and			
one national capital territory of Delhi there are Chief Minister and			
there are air bus cabinets and eyebrow cabinets and air bus three twenty			
cabinets in these places 			
They teach you about the greatness of my literature in Telugu			
and my literature in Tamil and my literature in Kannada and my literature			
in Marathi and my literature in Gujrathi and my literature in something 			
 There's hardly anybody to teach any of my children			
 my literature in India 			
But that is not all the history you got to teach people in			
this country in bad English			
If you go to the history classes Mr Ashoka dugged wells and he			
builded hospitals laughter 			
That is the kind of history being taught you know what is the			
use of giving only the English teachers to this class what about the History			
teacher who gets into the class and dictates notes saying Ashoka			
dugged wells and he builded hospitals 			
Justice India evoking you a feeling of an India which			
made my grandfather's grandfather's grandfather look at a			
little pot of water and say in Sanskrit 			
That was long before somebody said Kaveri is my grandfather's			
 river or my grandmother's river 			
Today you and I have been taught English must be abolished			
 the local language should be brought in in Hindi 			
laughter and applause 			
Have you taught the children of this country the greatness of this			
country where there is a part of the country which get five hundred and			
fifty inches of rain per year and still has drinking water problem for five			
months in the year because they have rendered the total topography 			
similar to my head laughter 			
Do you know of Barmare and Rajasthan or Savai Madhavpur where the			
annual rainfall is two inches ?			
Do you know the Rann of Kuch where only the white wild ass and			
the red Flemingo are available ?			
Do you know the snow deserts of Ladakh where the snow leopard			
alone lives ?			
Do you know the rain forest of Kerala and of Arunachal where			
botanical and uhm zoological diversity is at its acme of completion			
 ?			
Not of perfection but of completion 			
What do you teach them ?			
You teach them that the Kakatiyas were in Warangal and the			
Chalukyas were in Badami 			
Fact what lot of good it does to me to know that Kakatiya were			
in Warangal and therefore Warangal University is named after Kakatiya is			
that right ? laughter 			
Oh fact lot of good it does to me if somebody comes and says			
 What is the Kakatiya ? 			
Now if I'm especially when the Doordarshan			
 prouncer prounces it 			
You don't know whether she is speaking English or French or what			
foreign language she is speaking laughter 			
Our Education system to which I shall come back which is going			
to be the theme of what I want to say today is the greatest tragedy			
which is available in this country today			
Or in their greater tragedy there are there are any number of			
tragedies in this country and those of you who're standing I			
recommend warmly that you sit down otherwise you will get tired 			
laughter 			
 You'd be happy to know that you and Professor Shastri they are preparing a cassette of the spoken Indian English			
 			
English was very old in this country from the time of			
the East India Company 			
East India Company which came to India in seventeenth century			
 they started English in the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh to begin			
it 			
And then with the establishment of East India Company at Madras			
Calcutta and Bombay things have improved 			
And during seventeenth century as well as in eighteenth			
that is finally English was systematized and standardized by			
the Macaulay's minute 			
It was introduced in the schools which was started by the East			
India Company and English became one of the subjects of study 			
People have been studying English for last so many years			
 and uh it became a big a matter after the establishment			
of the three universities at the provincial cities of Madras Bombay and			
Calcutta 			
English is studied both for its language as well as for			
literature 			
English has influenced the Indians and very much it has given			
strength and source to them to fight against the British later on			
Through English only Indians have came to know what is a			
democratic system how the government works in England and the speeches of			
Burke			
And many other uh leaders in the British Parliament 			
influenced the Indian leaders 			
And English is one of the motive factor for many people 			
who started writing in Indian languages even Bankim Chandra Chatterji			
 who wrote such a beautiful novel like uh Anandmath			
 was influenced by English and he gave a slogan called			
 Vande Mataram 			
So English has become one of the important languages in India			
English is studied today in schools colleges 			
universities 			
English is the lingua franca 			
And I think through English only for the first time 			
India is uh made one uh otherwise it will be difficult for most			
of the Indians to know each other 			
Because there are so many languages in India there are nearly			
seven hundred languages in India			
There was a cultural unity but a linguistic unity was not there			
And uh therefore English has provided this and in this 			
unity of language people began to be united they used to exchange their			
 opinions they used to read newspapers which were coming in English			
and therefore the people like uh uh Srinivasa Iyengar who has written			
about the development of Indian English through his book Indian Writing			
in English			
It is a good thing the English have done to this country 			
During the last two hundred years the language was 			
developing in different ways 			
English is not spoken uniformly by all the Indians 			
As a matter of fact English is not spoken uniformly even			
in England 			
Only R P is spoken only South of London 			
There are other dialects like uh uh Scottish dialect or Welsh			
dialect or other dialects which are not standard dialects of English 			
Like that in India also uh the English is influenced by 			
Indian languages 			
Every Indian who speaks English is influenced is by by			
his mother tongue 			
And there is a Telugu English there is a Tamilian English 			
there is a Punjabi English there is a Hindi English like that various			
dialects are there 			
For these things we had to bring out a standard a standard to			
understand each other and a standard which can be useful to have a			
 to systemize the this International language 			
English is essential today in the modern world because			
English is spoken by the largest number of people in the world 			
English is spoken in America English is spoken in Australia			
 New Zealand Canada and many other countries 			
I think nearly one third of the uh people of the world they			
are speaking in English			
English is adopted by even other countries who are 			
 do not speak English because of its uh business 			
purposes and transport purposes and many other purposes 			
Therefore English is essential today to the country			
Probably the old classic classical and uh English is			
spoken in the colonies as pointed by Rushdie in a better way than			
his own mother country 			
So English is International nobody can say that English is not			
wanted today 			
English is required for anybody to become international in			
communication 			
They therefore English is going to live in India even 			
uh against the wishes of many other people 			
And there are people in this country who're talking			
that English is to be replaced by Hindi and regional languages 			
Regional languages are to be studied as well as the national			
language is studied and at the same time we require an international			
language which will uh make us a part of the world 			
Because the world is only a global village today 			
India cannot survive without English or a International			
language like English 			
And uh it is important for every country 			
Therefore English will remain with us 			
And English is studied even in the Central Institute of			
English and Foreign Languages which has come into existence in nineteen			
fifty-eight 			
This Institute was established when the Government of India 			
in the education department and by the British council as well as the			
Ford Foundation 			
And it was established with a specific purpose to improve			
 the language content of the En English 			
 			
And English literature is taught by all universities in			
their department of English literature 			
But language was not studied 			
There is a controversy whether English language is to be			
learnt through literature or literature is to be learnt through 			
English language 			
Both are important they are the two co uh sides of the			
same coin 			
And one can learn good English and by that he can learn			
good literature 			
Or if one is a constant reader of literature one may acquire			
 unconsciously good English 			
But English has many other aspects 			
It has its spoken aspect 			
One should be conscious of the pronunciation 			
And if a Indian goes and talks in United States of			
India United States of America one may not understand			
what he is speaking because his English contains wrong stresses 			
and wrong tone probably people will not understand him 			
Therefore it is essential to standardize what we speak 			
And the Institute of Central Institute of English and			
Foreign Languages makes a good effort it at it			
It has a language lab it has various other facilities 			
through which it wants to improve the standard of of English 			
spoken by every segment of the people of India 			
Therefore number of people after their M A or			
postgraduation in English language or education or some other subject 			
they come to the Central Institute of English for studying English			
language 			
We have different courses here and uh we have E L T 			
methodology 			
We have a language laboratory and the department of spoken			
English and uh phonetics			
We have other departments also 			
These departments during a course of one year they give a			
systematic training in studying English language 			
And uh this is helpful for most of the teachers who come here			
 to learn English because when they go back they can teach better			
English to their students 			
It will have a percolative effect because these teachers who			
are trained they can teach better when they go back to the schools or			
colleges 			
And the students are to be taught young because their			
pronunciation if it is influenced by a trained teacher in English at the			
Central Institute of English he will be a better speaker and an effective			
speaker 			
Communication with proper pronunciation is important to			
understand each other 			
Therefore English spoken English particularly is important			
 at the regional level at the national level as well as international			
level 			
And English is given the importance in our education system 			
As a matter of fact most of the publications in India are			
in English uh every year we're publishing nearly eighteen			
thousand books in India 			
Out of eighteen thousand nearly eight thousand to nine thousand			
books are in English and whereas the remaining are published in the			
regional languages or uh vernacular languages of India 			
So the publication not only in the case of books even in			
the case of newspaper most of the important newspapers are in English 			
Newpapers like Times of India The Hindu			
 and uh they are very effective communication media most of			
 the circulation of these two papers are very large 			
People throughout India they read these newspapers and uh 			
the English is the lingua franca today in India effective connector			
between various states who speaks various languages 			
Therefore English is uh unlikely to go from this country			
 and English will remain for a long time to come 			
Uhm so the the English has uh uh in English is 			
part of the national life and uh throughout education the			
students in the schools and colleges they read it			
But mostly the English is an effective medium only from the			
college level after school leaving 			
Therefore the English if it is introduced even at uh			
 at class three year class four that will be more effective and			
uh a bilingual child or a multilingual child is more intelligent 			
and the language can be learnt only at the in 			
childhood 			
And instead of forcing English at a later stage of life 			
which will be difficult and as a child will pick up a 			
languages easier and quicker 			
Therefore English would be introduced at a uh the school			
level rather than at uh college level 			
And uh English is also important to get jobs and people			
with more education they want to go outside their country 			
If India like I India which has			
 large population if it wants to export its educated people 			
 to other countr to other countries like			
Singapore or Saudi Arabia or U S A English is essential 			
Even in the case of the professional uh educated people like			
engineers or doctors if they want to go abroad they require English			
language 			
And uh without English one at one cannot go outside			
India			
And even if he goes outside he will find number of			
difficulties 			
And uh professionally also if one wants to be up-to- date 			
he should know and he should read English books books which are			
coming in English 			
And most of the uh knowledge which is created throughout			
 the world somehow or other by translation or by uh			
recreation it is coming into English language books which are published on			
large scale in England America Australia Hongkong and other			
places			
Therefore through the English language books only you			
come to know what is happening outside our own country			
And uh they through them the research is developed 			
Research is one of the important activity for any country 			
because without research it is you cannot uh develop			
And uh the development for the development of a country you			
require information latest technology latest knowledge 			
Knowledge is a resource today 			
Now without knowledge you cannot have anything 			
It can be other resources 			
You can have a resource of one word you can have a 			
coal resources you can have petroleum resources 			
But knowledge resource is very important knowledge is power			
Uh even you take a small country like Japan which is only			
as big as an Andhra Pradesh but it is today on the top of the			
world			
It is because of the technology which they learn through English			
language 			
And even England which is not bigger than one state of our			
country and England ruled the world for a long time and there was			
a saying that sun sun never set on the British Empire 			
How did uh the small countries small isles like British			
Isles could rule such a vast world ?			
It is because of the latest innovations that have taken place 			
in their country and these are essential if you have come to know about			
 the developments in science it has it was only possible by reading			
 English language books 			
We have come to know about Newton's theory of gravity and			
even Einstein's theory of relativity			
All these things helped us helped our science 			
And particularly in science and technology most of the books are			
in English and they are not in vernacular languages 			
The defect is the international terminology is in English 			
and it is a standardised terminology it is not possible to have the			
translations of the same terminology in our vernacular languages 			
the our languages have haven't developed that much 			
Back to our I S L M model that we had discontinued			
 last week 			
And uh a continuation part of it is the second set of the			
market and that was the monitary sector equilibrium 			
And when we come to this already we have seen how the real			
sector reaches to its equilibrium position and the result of which			
is the I S curve 			
 We've drawn the I S curve also 			
Now here we come to this L M curve 			
The equilibrium in the monetary sector would ultimately give			
diagramatically the L M curve 			
And why L M as we know well L is liquidity M is money			
Now following almost the same pattern of explanation as we			
did in case of I S curve we can very well present this whole thing 			
But initially the proposition is that the monitary sector			
equilibrium is reached at the rate of interest at which 			
money supply equals money demand 			
A very simple kind of an identity you can take into			
account here 			
Its a situation wherein money supply would be equal to 			
money demand 			
So this equality between money supply and money demand is the			
condition of equilibrium here 			
To put briefly then M S H to indicate supply of money			
 is equal to M D small letter of capital letter and			
this we say is the condition of equilibrium 			
And this will be our first equation 			
First equation very simple thing 			
And now you will find that the rest of this analysis when we			
progress would be by and large within the Keyntian 			
framework 			
Almost much closer to your explanation of tension			
liquidity preference theory of interest 			
Much of that is adopted here 			
So the matters become quite simple for us 			
For example as we did last time left side right hand side 			
Now what determines the money supply ?			
We have already given an answer to this when we			
discussed tension theory 			
What determines the money supply ?			
The state of reputation 			
 It's the monetary who determines the monetary			
authority 			
So money supply is determined by the monetary authority 			
 B B writing 			
And it is because of this we will not be able to get any			
equation so far as money supply is concerned because there is 			
no set formula for determining money supply at a time 			
That is just on the basis of the needs of the time that			
the monetary authority goes on contracting or expanding the money supply			
One side is open 			
And therefore now for the rest of the thing every emphasis			
will be placed on the demand side 			
Now when you come to the demand side of money this demand is			
determined by B B writing by the tension method 			
Three motives three motives haan 			
 we'll put in general say by the three motives B B writing			
 which govern liquiditive preference 			
And we follow this particular line cough uh when you			
say after three motives we group together say in general say			
transactions and precautionary motives 			
Now when you come to the transactions and precautionary motive 			
say broadly they will be calling it as transactions motive 			
Both are combined together 			
Now when you take into consideration this one this			
transactions motive that is liquidity preference for transaction motive			
 depends on 			
Level of 			
Level of income			
Level of income B B writing 			
It depends on level of income 			
Now in tension language this transactions demand for 			
money is indicated by the term M Y 			
Level of income is Y 			
Therefore if you would like to put this by way of impression 			
means say M-one is a function of income 			
M-one is a function of income 			
Now this is second equation that you are able to get 			
So one part of the total money demand is taken care of 			
Then you come to the second part of it and that is what			
comes now ?			
Speculate			
Speculative demand 			
Now speculative demand for money B B writing this			
depends on ?			
Rate of interest 			
Correct it depends on rate of interest 			
And therefore you want of this speculative demand is described as			
M-two 			
The notation M-two has been used by Kens and therefore we			
put in that M-two is a function of you can use any notation to			
indicate function F or K anything is a function of R that is the			
third impression 			
What we are doing here is just using the tension model of liquidity			
preference 			
And it's mostly that which Hicks and Henson have used 			
in order to give us the monetary sector equilibrium 			
Now given this two things equations two and three now 			
what we know that M D that demand is equal to M-one			
plus M-two B B writing 			
This is what we know 			
If that is so given this therefore we can say to put this			
in equilibrium one or this condition of equilibrium 			
So we can say then that substituting B B writing 			
in substituting two and three in equation one 			
This and this we would be substituting in equation one 			
Therefore we say money supply is equal to let us initially put			
M money demand just derivation every step I would like to put before you			
And M D is uhm one plus M-two 			
And we know that M-one is a function of Y 			
So instead of M-one if you put in or substitute F Y 			
its a function of Y that is income 			
And n place of M-two put K R its function of rate of interest			
So this you're able to get ultimately that money			
supply is equa function of Y plus a function of			
rate of interest 			
This becomes your equation number four 			
As we derived fourth equation in case of the real sector			
equilibrium 			
And once you come this this is the equation of L M			
curve B B writing 			
This is the equation of L M curve 			
So in a simple way we have derived these four equations 			
Just see the stage by which we have progressed 			
We began with the fact that the equilibrium in the money market or			
money sector would be establishd at the rate of interest at which			
 money supply is equal to money demand 			
Money supply is determined by the monetary authority at any			
given time 			
Money demand is determined by liquidity preference 			
So you will find here the L comes here and the M comes on the			
other side 			
The right hand side of this equation is all liquidity feature			
The left hand side is the money feature 			
And therefore liquidity money they are the two dimensions which			
are used 			
In case of liquidity the transactions demand for money 			
M-one is determined by income level 			
So M-one is a function of Y income 			
Whereas the speculative demand for money M-two depends on R			
 rate of interest 			
And therefore M-two is a function of R 			
Naturally substitute these two in one and ultimately you have			
come to this part 			
So as I said the left part denotes M money supply 			
The right part determines L the liquidity preference 			
And therefore this is an equation of liquidity and money 			
In graphical terms it is described as L M curve liquidity			
money curve 			
So again you find that this part is so easy to present 			
because it is nothing but a repetition of tension presentation by and			
large 			
What you teach in the tensus liquidity preference theory 			
The same part is used we've put in terms of four			
equations 			
Now once we have done this basic exercise then we go to draw			
 the diagram 			
And since there are four equations by which we are putting this			
 we again follow the four diagraphic chart for coming to the L M			
curve 			
And therefore in this case again I'll suggest you to			
take a full page for the diagram 			
The four diagrams we will be drawing side by side 			
As usual we take up one two three four in an 			
anti-clock fashion 			
And the direction would be the same as we have now notice 			
you start from diagram one reach to diagram two then come to diagram			
three and from three you come downwards to diagram four 			
Now to begin with in case of uh the first diagram 			
We begin with the speculative demand for money M-two 			
The first diagram begins with M-two 			
So on X-axis you measure M-two which means speculative			
demand for money B B writing 			
And then on Y-axis what would come ?			
Rate of interest			
Rate of interest R would be there 			
Now we would follow the same technique as we did last time			
Taking numerical scales because the matters become very			
simple for our understanding B B writing 			
Just the usual figures perhaps I've taken 			
Now again the second stage that we follow is to have the			
vertical and horizontal faint lines 			
So that the graph sheet would be ready 			
And we know here the relationship between the speculative			
demand for money and the rate of interest 			
Is it positive or negative ?			
Negative 			
Negative			
Negative 			
So M-two is negative function of the rate of interest 			
That is what we note in this case also 			
If at all you can add this particular no E it is L			
negative function M-two is a negative function of R the			
rate of interest 			
They have a negative relationship 			
So naturally as usual you find if the rate of interest is suppose			
eight percent quite high the speculative demand can be just hundred			
 a quite low demand for speculative purposes 			
If it comes down to seven percent the speculative demand will go			
up to two hundred 			
You move to the right on X-axis as you come down on			
Y-axis lower the rate of interest more the demand for speculative			
purpose 			
So rate of interest if it comes down to six percent you have			
demand three hundred 			
If it comes to five percent demand is four hundred 			
And if it comes to four percent say demand is five percent			
And we join these points get a curve 			
Now this curve can be described as a curve for M-two 			
M- two curve and if you wish to write here the demand			
functions speculative demand function M-two is a function of rate of			
interest 			
So you have taken care of equation number three here that is			
represented well 			
Now from there you pass on to equation number uh the diagram			
number two 			
And as you know that the usual way of drawing that			
whatever is presented on X-axis in diagram number one will be repeated on			
X-axis in diagram number two 			
And therefore in this diagram you will have M-two			
represented on X-axis 			
So let's first have the scale of M-two 			
transfered to this B B writing 			
And let's have the vertical lines drawn 			
So here you have the speculative demand or money 			
 B B writing transfered here 			
Now this second diagram will take care of the equality			
identity money supply equal to money demand 			
But this identity will represent not simply by saying 			
Money supply equal to money demand but that we would be taking with			
the help of one which was here money demand was is equal to			
 M-one plus M-two 			
And that part we will be taking money demand equal to M-one			
 plus M-two 			
And here we assume its certain total money demand which			
means money supply it equals money supply 			
Suppose here we assume that money demand which means			
money supply also is five hundred crores of 			
rupees 			
If we presume this then this graph what would come on			
the vertical part of this diagram ?			
 It's N 			
No 			
You have to concentrate only on that equation 			
If on X-axis you are able and you have taken speculative			
demand for money that is M-two what would come ?			
Rate of interest			
Rate of interest 			
Where comes the rate of interest in this equation ?			
 One word 			
Its two words 			
 Laughs 			
This has to be understood correctly and properly because 			
this can be an accidence for for any any person while drawing the			
diagram 			
Other things would follow very automatically 			
interruptions laughs 			
No income business should be there no rate of interest should			
be there 			
Supply of money is equal to demand for money and demand for			
money is broken into two parts M-one plus M-two 			
If one axis takes care of M-two the other axis must take care			
of ?			
M-one 			
M-one laughs 			
See how it comes I'll explain to you 			
But let us put this and have the diagram ready for drawing			
this one 			
Say M-one which represents now you are coming to equation			
number two which is an equation of M-one uhm			
And you are bringing in M-one plus M-two both together 			
which make up the demand for money and which is equal to supply of money 			
So that identity can be represented this way 			
Let us first go for this scale 			
We follow the same numbers here easy way to put in 			
You can use any numbers B B writing 			
But normally I presume in all classes that the students know			
number upto ten maximum one to ten 			
So that very easy to go with single digits if at all a class			
like yours is there I presume that you know numbers upto hundred 			
Uh because calculations orally become very easy			
The whole thing is that what figures you take do not			
matter what this hundred means it can be hundred rupees			
 it can be hundred crore of rupees			
 hundred million of rupees whatever you can put			
into bracket 			
So how much amount you put in it is immaterial that 			
So let us have the horizontal line to get the points			
corresponding to X and Y axis 			
Now let us see how this comes into 			
We have presumed that total demand for money is five hundred 			
And this total demand for money is M-one plus M-two 			
Now given this M D equal to five hundred if I give you			
 an amount equal to M-two I think you can do some subtraction 			
and find out the value of M-one 			
Now let us go this way that given that if M-two is			
hundred what will be M-one ?			
Four hundred			
Four hundred you know subtraction very well 			
Then sub herein comes the first point that both			
together will make up five hundred rupees 			
So M-two is hundred and therefore remaining is M-one			
is four hundred 			
The transactions demand for money 			
Indian food is often spoken of as rich which is to say fatty			
 and spicy meaning chilli hot 			
Nothing should be farther from the truth 			
It is unfortunate that the excessive use of desi ghee			
 which is clarified butter or vegetable shortening and spices 			
by a handful of half baked cook made as a misunderstood food 			
Our food is rich but not fatty 			
It is true that we sometimes cook in a little more fat than			
necessary 			
But the amazing thing about Indian cuisine is that the cooking is			
deemed complete when the fat leaves the sides or comes on the surface 			
In other words the ingredients expose all fat when fully			
cooked 			
The excess fat merely uses the cooking process 			
In any event it is supposed to be drained off before the dish is			
served 			
In fact the drained fat which we call rogan 			
 can be reused and makes a better fat medium because the flavour and aroma			
of spices acquired during the cooking of the dish 			
Of course the rogan cannot be used again and			
again but just once again which is not to say that this series is			
even for one solitary moment recommending that to use a gram or a			
mililitre of extra fat 			
The same applies for that nasty word spicy 			
The fact is our food is spicy not chilli hot 			
We make use of our exotic spices for their special flavour and			
aroma 			
The use of red chilli on the other hand is at one's			
 own discreation like to burn yourself do so don't want to			
 don't burn others as well 			
There are however some regions which are using more red			
chillies than the others 			
They are the exceptions rather than the rule 			
Having said that this episode is guarantee to give lovers of			
hot food a vicarious thrill 			
Those with feeble guts I advice to stay away from today's			
 fiery delight cough 			
Hey Manjit what's this pungent nose testing aroma ?			
What you are smelling is red chillies 			
And believe it or not we are going to use sixty-four			
red chillies with two and a quarter pound of meat 			
He is going to make us the spice chop called lal maas			
 translated that means red meat 			
One of the kinds you and I know about 			
The red here refers to this red chillies 			
And he is going to use sixty of them mind boggling figure 			
Of course this is arguably the hottest dish in the land			
As you can see this guy is just about ready to burn my in all			
You if you have steel- line stomach this is just a delicacy			
for you 			
Whatever my fears about red chillies I've got a health			
mandate and get into my dig 			
Welcome to this Dawat the first dish in today's 			
menu is lal maas or red meat 			
Pieces of succulant lamb in a volcanic gravy 			
A dish guaranteed to wake up your insights 			
 We'll begin with a list of ingredients 			
Two and a quarter pounds or one kilo of lamb deboned and cut it			
into one and a half inch cubes 			
Sixty red chillies 			
One and a quarter cups finely sliced onions 			
One third cup peeled and sliced garlic 			
One cup yoghurt 			
One teaspoon roasted cumin 			
Four teaspoons corriander powder 			
Half a teaspoon turmeric powder 			
Five tablespoons refined oil 			
The preparation time for this dish is one hour and the cooking			
time is fifty minutes 			
With accompaniments this dish serves approximately four people			
The method 			
Remove stems from the red chillies slit them beseed and			
soak sixty whole red chillies in a bowl of water for fifteen minutes 			
Before you get alarmed at the quantity of red chillies used 			
here is a reassuring word about red chillies 			
While Manjeet prepares the other ingredients let me clear			
some cobwebs about red chillies 			
For a long time especially outside this country the word			
spicy has been synonymous with chillies 			
To us Indians the word spicy means a combination of exotic			
spices of which chilli is just one measly part 			
Eaten in the right quantity and the prescribed limit is one			
teaspoon or two or three whole red chillies per person per day 			
Chillies are said to prevent cold cold sweats induced by			
tension and cholera 			
Now in the last thing it is important to consume a little			
bit of chilli during the monsoon 			
Proceeding with the preparation whisk one cup of yoghurt			
in a bowl 			
Add the red chillies shake a dry girdle and add one			
teaspoonful of cumin seeds 			
Roast lightly noise of roasting until the cumin pops			
and emits a unique aroma 			
Now add this to the yoghurt chilli mixture noise of			
stirring 			
Add four teaspoons of corriander powder half teaspoon turmeric			
powder and stir in salt to taste 			
Whisk and set 			
Some of the effects of the red chillies are also neutralised by the			
garlic and yoghurt in this recipe 			
Without yoghurt it would probably be impossible to digest all those			
red hot chillies 			
And now for the cooking 			
Heat five tablespoons of refined oil add the sliced garlic and			
set over a medium heat until golden noise of stirring 			
Add the onions and stir again until golden brown nise of			
stirring 			
Finally add the meat and stir fry until the fat begins to leave			
the sides of the pan 			
This process is also called pruno and takes approximately five			
to six minutes 			
Now add the chilli yoghurt mixture and stir fry until the			
moisture evaporates noise of stirring 			
To complete the cooking add three and one third cups of water			
Bring to a boil cover and simmer stir occasionally until			
the meat is cooked 			
To check if the meat is done take out a piece and break it			
apart 			
The gravy should boil till it has the consistency of a thick sauce			
Check the salt and the fiery red meat is done 			
But this is best eaten with the steamed rice or chapati			
 			
Arrange chopped tomatoes and onions in a platter and spoon on			
the sizzling lal maas 			
The second dish on our menu today is Pepper Chicken or mori			
curry 			
Chicken with a totally unique flavour salty chicken taste buds			
Pepper chicken is from the Chickena district in Tamil Nad 			
which is home to the trading community of Chickenna 			
They however call it murgakoli chickenna 			
In it they use an inordinately large quantity of coarsely ground			
black pepper powder 			
I can see Manjeet is getting a bit little impatient 			
And I'll tell you a little bit more about the pepper 			
later in this programme 			
If you are ready with your stationery here is a list of			
ingredients 			
Twelve chicken thighs seven corns cardamoms five cloves			
 two sticks of cinnamon one inch each a quarter teaspoon fenugreek			
seeds one and half cups of finely chopped onions two teaspoons			
ginger paste two teaspoons garlic paste two tablespoons corriander			
powder two teaspoons chilli powder six medium sized tomatoes			
beseeded and diced three table spoons coconut paste three fourth			
cups of corriander leaves five tablespoons of freshly ground pepper			
corns salt to taste and refined oil for cooking 			
The preparation time for this dish is thirty-five minutes and			
the cooking time forty minutes 			
With accompaniments this dish serves about four people 			
For the marinade in a bowl add thirty spoons of crushed pepper			
corns and salt to taste 			
To this add four tablespoons of oil stir to mix 			
stirring 			
Rub the chicken thighs individually in the marinade and set			
aside for thirty minutes 			
And now on to the cooking 			
Heat six tablespoons of refined oil in a pan add the marinated			
chicken pieces one at a time 			
Set a evenly to feel in flavour and juices 			
Reduce to low heat and remove 			
Add more oil if required and in the same pan add five green			
cardamoms five cloves few sticks of cinnamon and a quarter			
teaspoon fenugreek seeds 			
Stir until golden and add the onions			
Saute until golden brown 			
Add two tablespoons each of ginger and garlic paste 			
and stir fry for a few minutes stirring 			
Add two tablespoons of corriander powder and two teaspoons of			
red chilli powder 			
Stir stirring 			
Add the tomatoes and saute it for a few minutes 			
Finally add a quarter cup of water and stir some more 			
When the fat begins to leave the sides add two teaspoons of			
freshly ground pepper corns 			
Stir lightly and add the coconut paste 			
Cook this mixture for two to four minutes 			
Now add the chicken and salt to taste 			
Add water 			
Reduce the heat cover and simmer until the chicken is			
tender 			
This will take approximately ten to twelve minutes 			
While we wait for the chicken to cook a brief word about black			
pepper			
Talking about chetinad it is inevitable that I			
should tell you about pepper 			
Foremost pepper is said to cure and prevent asthma 			
Taken with honey it is said to give relief in heavy cold 			
It is good for the heart and is said to ease stomach aches 			
and cure piles 			
Sprinkled on fruits or other foods along with salt sea or			
rock it is supposed to make for an excellent digestive 			
To serve make a bed of the gravy 			
Arrange pieces of chicken and garnish with fresh corriander			
 and more fresh ground pepper 			
In fact celebrity panel does not feel rich tonight with the			
 lal maas black will definitely be the other colour			
scheme Interuption 			
Let us proceed to the dining table while our guest try out			
this coveted dishes 			
You know what we are eating is murgakoli 			
chikenna when translated what that means is Pepper Chicken 			
I thought they ate really spicy food 			
Uh it is spicy but it is slightly fried means a			
little oil to go head off			
You know he makes the second dish for that laughs 			
Fifteen chicken pieces for this chicken and what pieces are			
these ?			
Yeah this chicken we have used the uh thigh of the			
chicken 			
So that you have the consistency uh is there in the base 			
I thought it is the same and that every every person gets			
the same part that is important			
Uhm			
Actually we have gone a step beyond uh uhm and what we are			
talking about now is dinapsychology 			
Uh and the objective here is to make sure that everybody			
is cut off meat or the the shape of the vegetable is identical so			
that when you peep into somebody else's plate you don't have			
this terrible sense of envy as if you know uh say Arti has the better			
piece and Romi hasn't got the one that she like 			
So we just make sure that everyboby is dining pleasurely equal by			
providing an identical cut all are being identical size of vegetables			
But this what about one word may be a particular			
guest would prefer to have another piece			
Romi it's not as if we sort of you know done this at			
random			
But we have consulted our butchers any how our butchery uh			
 in Indian cooking is a very very strong point without that you really			
can't uh provide any good uh delicacies			
So we consulted our butcher and as per his advice decided for			
example the case of the murgakoli chickenna but the ideal			
stuff would be the thigh 			
May be Manjeet can tell us a little bit more about it			
Yes its your own choice also and uh whether it may be			
that must need one dine whether you use dine from the			
thigh or the one word 			
I see that means originally from the chickenna if they			
have a specific piece or this you feel is inferior in now			
Well this uh they feel that one one word of the			
meat should to be used in a particular curry 			
Originally I've got some chicken of it used 			
that's to as a matter of fact if I may say I am looking a bit			
You know in the South in considering the one word as			
a major Brahminical influence			
And consequently you will uh notice that when you go down			
south that uh the pieces of meat are usually cut into very small 			
sizes 			
And they are really nugget size pieces 			
But they originally do it for snacks you they will know only			
use of this size			
Normally it can be looked this size 			
It is commonly believed that the only way to cook kabab			
 is in a tandoor or on a grill 			
Nothing could be farther from the truth 			
There are several ways to cook kabab and there			
are many kabab which can be cooked in several ways 			
To cite an example the tikka of kid or lamb can			
be roasted in the tandoor cooked on a grilled 			
shallow fried on a girdle or in the Rajastani style cooked in a 			
hundi or pot 			
There is another fine example where tikka or fish			
 or can be grilled in the tandoor or as in the case			
of uh Amritsari machali deep fried in a kadhai			
 which is a one word of worth 			
Moreover let me assure you that kabab cooked on			
grills with those and in kadhai are as popular as those			
roasted in the tandoor 			
Yet it is the tandoori kabab especially 			
tandoori chicken which helped Indian cuisine build its			
international reputation 			
Based upon the success Indian masters not only gave a			
gastronomic accent to the rustic kabab but created			
delicacies so sublime and subtle that they expand best selling			
restaurants which made curry places curry houses look ordinary in			
comparison			
At least as far as the bottom line was concerned 			
Hi Manjeet why so smug ?			
Hi Jack not smug but satisfied 			
Whenever I think of kabab I look upon a time			
 when there was nothing for vegetarian and today today it has much			
more to offer			
Welcome to this dawat 			
 Today's exquisite recipe has been especially selected for			
 kabab lovers 			
For those of you who enjoy grilled and fried food we have the most			
savoury kababs made from cottage cheese and spinach for the			
vegetarians and prawns and minced meat for the non- vegetarians 			
 We'll begin with the prawn kababs or			
 tandoori zhinga 			
If you are ready with the pen and paper coming up are a list of			
ingredients 			
Twelve shelled cleaned and washed A grade			
prawns 			
For the first marinade you need three tablespoons of ginger			
paste three tablespoons of garlic paste three tablespoons of lemon			
juice and salt to taste 			
For the second marinade you need one cup of yoghurt a			
quarter cup fresh cream two tablespoons of gram flour one and a			
half teaspoons ajawain one teaspoon white pepper powder			
 a quarter teaspoon clove powder 			
For the garnish you need tomatoes carrots and cucumber			
 onion rings papadam and lemon 			
For cooking you need a few tablespoons of butter 			
The preparation time for this dish is thirty minutes the			
cooking time is fifteen minutes 			
And with the accompanied salad it serves approximately four people			
For the first marination shell clean twelve 			
A grade prawns 			
In a bowl add three tablespoons ginger paste three			
tablespoons garlic paste three tablespoons lemon juice and salt to			
taste 			
Mix all these ingredients and coat the prawns thoroughly in			
this marinade 			
Cover and set aside for ten minutes 			
While the prawns are marinating prepare the second marinade 			
In a bowl put one cup of yoghurt add a quarter cup of cream			
and whisk 			
To this add two tablespoons of gram flour half teaspoon			
 ajwain one teaspoon white pepper powder clove			
powder and mix again stirring 			
Now remove the prawn pieces from the first marinade sqeeze and			
transfer to the second marinade 			
Sprinkle more salt to taste rub down in the marinade to insure			
that they are evenly coated 			
Cover and refrigerate for two hours 			
Remove the marinated prawns from the refrigerator and skewer			
about three together over lapping 			
Keep the tray under the grill to collect the spill overs 			
Now grill the prawns in the oven turning them frequently until			
they are golden brown 			
Remove from the oven and paste with butter 			
Return the rack to the oven and cook for two more minutes 			
To serve remove the prawns from the skewer arrange fresh			
tomatoes onion rings a lemon ridge and papadam 			
Squeeze lemon on the prawns before serving 			
For the spinached kababs here are a list of			
ingredients 			
Two and a quarter pounds or one kilograms fresh spinach one			
and a quarter cups chana dal or Bengal gram lentil a			
few cardamoms a few cloves cinnamon and salt 			
For the filling you need half cup grated cottage cheese 			
half teaspoon cumin seeds a quarter teaspoon freshly ground black pepper			
 and three walnuts 			
The spices needed are half teaspoon red chilli powder 			
half teaspoon cumin powder a quarter teaspoon freshly ground black			
pepper a quarter teaspoon green cardamom powder maize powder 			
clove powder and salt to taste 			
For the garnish you need fresh salad vegetables fried			
potato strolls and lemon 			
For the cooking you need oil for shallow frying and butter			
for pasting 			
The preparation time for this dish is forty-five minutes 			
The cooking time ten minutes 			
And with the salad it serves approximately four people 			
Clean two and a quarter pounds of spinach in fresh water 			
Drain 			
Keep a pan of water add spinach leaves and blanch for five			
minutes 			
Remove and refresh in cold water and drain 			
Take one and half cups of Bengal gram lentil 			
Soak Bengal gram lentil in a pan of water for approximately thirty			
minutes 			
For the spinach kababs we need only one and a			
quarter cups of the lentil 			
The remaining quarter cup will be reserved for the 			
shikenpuri kababs mentioned later in the show 			
After thirty minutes remove one and a quarter cups of the			
lentil and transfer to a pan 			
Add eight cloves one stick of cinnamon five cardamoms			
 salt to taste four and a half cups of water 			
Bring to a boil over medium heat 			
As soon as it begins to boil reduce the heat cover and			
simmer for approximately twenty-five minutes or until the lentils are			
well cooked 			
Remove from the fire and cool 			
Let us move to take the spinach by putting it through a mincer			
when cool 			
To prepare the filling grate half cup of cottage cheese 			
To this add half teaspoon cumin seeds a quarter teaspoon			
freshly ground pepper mix well and set aside 			
Prepare the walnuts by cutting them into quarters 			
When cool make a smooth paste of the lentils by putting them			
through a mincer or blender 			
Heat one tablespoon of oil in a frying pan add the spinach			
paste and stir fry over medium heat 			
Now add half teaspoon red chilli powder half teaspoon cumin			
powder quarter teaspoon black pepper powder quarter teaspoon green			
cardamom powder quarter teaspoon maize powder a pinch of clove			
powder and salt to taste 			
Reduce to low heat and stir fry until the water evaporates 			
Now add the lentil paste and stir until the two pastes blend			
together and the moisture is absorbed 			
Remove and cool 			
When the mixture is cooled divide it into twelve equal portions and			
shape into balls 			
Flatten each ball place a portion of the filling in the centre			
 top with the quartered walnut seam and reshape into a flat patty			
When all the patties are ready refrigerate for twenty to			
twenty-five minutes 			
To cook the kababs heat a little oil on a			
girdle place a few kababs on the hot oil and shallow fry over medium			
heat until golden brown 			
Slip over and brown the other side 			
Now paste with butter and cook once again until a darker brown			
crust appears 			
To serve arrange a salad on a dinner plate add the kababs			
 and serve with a lemon ridge in fried straw potatoes 			
For the yoghurt stuff minced kababs or 			
shiken puri kababs you need one pound minced kid or spring lamb			
A quarter cup Bengal gram dal ten cloves of			
garlic one teaspoon cumin seeds five pods of green cardamom 			
two sticks of cinnamon five cloves one teaspoon turmeric one			
teaspoon red chilli powder and salt 			
For the filling you need three tablespoons of yoghurt cheese			
 a few onions a bunch of mint four green chillies and salt			
For cooking we need oil for shallow frying and butter for			
pasting 			
For the garnish we need fresh salad lemon and green			
chillies 			
The preparation time for this dish is one hour 			
The cooking time is ten minutes 			
And with the salad it serves approximately four people 			
Put one pound of mint in a pan add a quarter cup of soaked and			
drained Bengal gram lentil add ten cloves of garlic one teaspoon			
cumin seeds five pods of green cardamom two sticks of cinnamon 			
five cloves one teaspoon turmeric powder one teaspoon red chilli			
powder salt two tablespoons of oil and one and half cups of			
water 			
Mix and bring to a boil over medium heat 			
Reduce to low heat cover and simmer until the lentil soften			
 and the water is absorbed 			
Stir occasionally to prevent burning stirring 			
Remove and cool 			
When the lentil minced mixture has cooled mince in a food			
processor or mixer 			
Remove to a plate and knead to mix thoroughly 			
Divide this mixture into twelve equal portions and shape into balls			
To prepare the filling chop two tablespoons of onions to			
this add two tablespoons of coarsely chopped mint 			
In a bowl mix these ingredients with three tablespoons of			
yoghurt cheese 			
Add four seeded and finely chopped green chillies salt to			
taste and mix well 			
Flatten each portion of the lentil minced mixture spoon in a			
portion of the filling fill and reshape into a patty 			
When all the patties are ready refrigerate for twenty to			
twenty-five minutes 			
On a girdle heat a few tablespoons of oil add the minced			
patties and shallow fry over medium heat until light brown 			
Flip over and brown the other side 			
Paste the butter and fry again until the crisp is dark brown 			
To serve arrange salad on a dinner plate serve with onion			
rings lemon and fried potato crisps add a green chilli for a spicier			
finish 			
For the cottage cheese kababs or paneer			
ka tikka here are a list of ingredients 			
One block of cottage cheese cut into cubes of one and half inch			
 by one and a half inch by threeforth inch 			
For the marinade you need one teaspoon black cumin seeds 			
two teaspoons ajawain and salt 			
For the second marinard you need two tablespoons of gram			
flour three seeded and finely chopped green chillies one cup cream			
 and salt to taste 			
For the garnish you need fresh salad vegetables and 			
papadam 			
The preparation time for this dish is twenty-five minutes 			
The cooking time is fifteen minutes 			
And with the salad it serves approximately four people 			
Cut the cottage cheese into thick cubes 			
In a bowl combine one teaspoon black cumin seeds two			
teaspoons ajawain and salt 			
Mix well and sprinkle this evenly over the cottage cheese cubes			
Keep aside for five minutes 			
In a bowl put two tablespoons of gram flour add three			
seeded and finely chopped green chillies salt one cup of cream 			
mix to make a marinade 			
Dip the cottage cheese cubes in this marinade coating evenly on			
all sides and remove to a plate 			
Pour the remaining marinade on the coated cheese cubes 			
cover and refrigerate for ninety minutes 			
To cook preheat the oven to two seventy-five degrees 			
Remove the kababs from the marinade skewer			
about four cubes placing them an inch apart on a skewer place a tray			
underneath to collect the drippings 			
Now put the kabab rack in the oven under a grill			
 and cook until golden brown 			
Turn the kababs occasionally to make sure that			
they are evenly grilled 			
When the kababs are done remove them from			
the oven and deskewer the cubes 			
To serve arrange salad vegetables on a plate put four			
 kababs add papadams and brush the			
cottage cheese with butter before serving 			
Come join our guests and enjoy these exotic spicy delights 			
that stimulate your appetite and pamper your palate 			
 It's moving 			
 It's moving okay 			
Okay now cough this is the D S P Sonograph 			
and this has a lot of hardware inside and also in it's ROM there			
is software 			
So the several commands we feed in it takes in and processes or do			
 done through this software which is built-in in it 			
And it's a special special purpose you can say 			
it's a special purpose computer 			
Then this is the monitor it's of two fifty-six colour			
shade monitor 			
You can see the I have to get the uh mike on			
Mike			
Microphone is on uh what's his name ?			
Last man			
Now who is the last man ?			
Uh Anupam 			
 Anupam's table is there in a in a in			
a package you can pick it up 			
Uh uh hello 			
Uhm this is a very sensitive uhm uh monitor it can give			
you two hundred and fifty-six grades of colour 			
Compared with a V G E monitor which you see usually a good monitor			
which gives you four shades 			
We get uh nice uh this thing and it's a flat screen too			
 It's not protruding this way it's a flat screen			
 monitor 			
And this also could also be connected to a computer			
Right now laughs these guys are trying and not able to			
succeed that's another problem they have 			
You can operate certain things from the computer 			
Yeah 			
Uhm there are we should look at this all the			
controls are at the front panel 			
There are some controls at the back panel but they have to be 			
used very rarely for a initial setting sense on 			
Output there are certain outputs that could be taken from the			
back panel 			
Here you have this this is the input section and this			
is the output section 			
You input speech or any sound you can also get the output			
of the sound 			
Usually it is if you don't mute it the output comes			
through the speakers which are connected at the back 			
You can also listen through a headphone here 			
The inputting is done you have two channels you can choose			
two channels channel one and channel two 			
Yeah 			
And then first do the recording 			
When you are recording through a microphone you have to insert			
this into the microphone here 			
This this is channel one this is channel two 			
This is for microphone and this is for auxilary that is tape			
recorder and such purpose 			
It will be higher voltage input 			
And similarly the other two cough 			
You also select your input level it is at thirty degree which			
is a comfortable input level 			
You can also increase it to seventy seventy is the maximum 			
and it becomes you can see that it is getting over loaded 			
See even it's picking up from here 			
hello hello hello 			
 That's too much actually 			
So we go down to thirty 			
Now it's not so sensitive 			
Let me get out of that actually that takes time to display			
Yeah hello 			
This is the convention spectrogram that has bottom of the layer			
 and the top one is a it's in a wave form 			
So you can input it here from here either through			
microphone or through the auxiliary input 			
And then okay for inputting you have to do record you			
have to be in record mode 			
Once you press this one this is a very sacred button 			
If you press anything here whatever is recored gets erased as			
there is this it's a circular buffer is there continously			
records and erases 			
As it proceeds it goes in a circle 			
So once I press this it's now recording 			
recording is going on recording is going on right now whatever 			
I'm saying is going inside and it is being kept inside 			
Now to stop it and to preserve that signal I have to press this			
knob 			
And then always that enhance is necessary comes you just press this			
button E it will do the enhancement on its own 			
Now the settings have been changed let me come back 			
 go back to my settings cough 			
 Hello yeah			
I have increased the input level here to forty degree you			
can see the difference in the the way the amplitude is getting			
displayed there 			
Now when I decrease it to thirty you will see that it becomes less			
 and twenty still less 			
Okay forty forty is quite comfortable in fact uh sometimes			
it becomes a bit loud 			
What we can get here is a continous spect 			
Right now what we have chosen a spectrogram at the bottom 			
screen and the wave form at the top screen 			
So let's say something like akka			
 			
In fact there is a clipping here this kind of straight line			
means there is too much space means too loud that clipping is going			
on 			
That clipping is going on which should be avoided 			
Clipping means it's it's it's called overloading 			
overloading 			
You can see that it's it's clipping here too 			
So we should not be too close there 			
So akka akka this is			
quite comfortable cough 			
Uh just if you take this signal akka			
 here you can you can get a few points in this			
I mean the interesting points you can see there 			
One thing is you can see it is something like I produce			
something like a sentence a declarative sentence with a pitch falling			
 you see the pulses are going down becoming separated here and			
here too the distance between pulse to pulse is becoming more and more			
 that means your pulses in in a in a given period of time so the			
pitch is less 			
And we can do many many things with this signal here 			
 Let's put some cursors now this this brings cursors in and			
out okay 			
So the cursors give you the facility to measure			
Let me shift them now they are on the lower screen the red			
cursor I'll shift them to a shift it to the upper screen			
Now there you see a red cursor but that's not one			
cursor there is a green cursor behind it 			
Just we are moving this moves the cursors 			
By moving it okay you get the both the cursors			
separated the reading at the red cursor is three point six five			
something reading of the green one is three point five the			
 dif the difference is point one three 			
Yeah okay point one three			
So this duration between these two cursors has come out			
as point one three four one three four four seconds 			
We can use this kind of information 			
Let me expand this very form but as it's in two contract			
form			
So I can go back to time access okay and select the time			
access and the upper screen this is my upper screen I activate			
that small knob there and make it expanded and it's 			
enhanced now 			
Yeah it will rewrite 			
Redraw that I unselect I unselect still this we have			
to enhance 			
So I say enhanced it has enhanced it has redrawn in an			
expanded way okay 			
What I can do is I can precisely measure the length of the			
closure the length of the closure of K in akka			
 			
Okay now this store business is that it makes the cursors 			
where it converts the red and green to green and red 			
It has the only the red cursor moves the green cursor does not move			
So if I want to move this cursor I have to have it in red			
colour 			
If I want to move this first I have to make it red then I			
can move it 			
Or if I want to move back convert into red and then move it			
Okay now roughly that is the time taken for the K to that			
is the maintaining that's it due that's the closure period			
of the K in akka 			
That is point one nine second roughly point two seconds			
 okay 			
Point two seconds cough 			
So immediately you can get the measurement of the durations			
I want to measure the duration of this aa 			
as opposed this aa 			
 That's very easy point one point one seconds			
And then somewhere roughly there and somewhere roughly			
there it's point point one four seconds that was hundred			
milli-seconds and this is hundred and forty-seven milli-seconds 			
okay 			
 Let's take a word two words in Marathi 			
See what is the difference between the so called 			
shwa vowel there kara kar karto			
 kar karto 			
This is a kar tu kar 			
means you do the work imperative form of kar 			
 			
And it is phonetically shwa 			
 It's not a long shwaa it's 			
a shwa 			
Uhn let's look at it's length point			
one eight point one eight four six 			
This is aa of 			
 kar 			
This is a this is K is			
here you can't see K this a 			
simply a okay 			
In fact you can hear that you can choose a particular portion			
here how it sounds or indeed the head phones otherwise it will disturb			
everybody and you know if you go on playing that 			
And then this is karto me kaam karto			
 let's say 			
Now this is the now this is the K closure 			
 a a ki closure O fading away			
Fading out 			
Now here remember that was point one eight four seconds 			
okay kar a this guy is point			
zero seven okay almost half 			
So this way immediate measurement you can get and if you have			
let us say hundred or hundred two hundred samples just transfer them			
one by one 			
There is a you can have a large uh buffer also			
And you can choose the buffer size and measure them 			
Now sometimes you have a doubt about where a particular			
segment started and where a seg segment 			
stopped let's say ended 			
We have both systems 			
Let me realign them 			
Okay this is the kar 			
 you can see this this is spectogram of the same thing I gave the same			
signal in both the screens this is the wave form and this is the			
sound spectogram cough 			
Sound spectogram is a is a two			
dimensional thing 			
And here you can see the formants that means change in			
colour 			
You see the F one F two F three F four and each vertical			
slash let me explain this you will see this 			
Okay now it's clear you can see the slash one			
after another corresponding to this pulses each slashes is one lot of			
pulse 			
You can make it even even uh more a 			
Now let's watch how the how the pulses look like			
Look at each pulse each pulse 			
Yeah 			
Each pulse 			
So it is like that 			
Then uh we come back go back to 			
 the original earlier one 			
You can see the formant transition this is the 			
 aa and going higher going into 			
 ra 			
This is falling down to ra 			
 as ra has that S two rise S two			
fall kind of thing 			
Uhn so those make you about what is a formant I'll just			
immediately show you what it is			
Let me invoke another module 			
 It's a rerecorded the signal is a bit loud here 			
Now cough because of this 			
Yeah 			
 I'll rerecord this signal 			
Take the let's take the vowel e 			
Vowel e has the first spectral peak 			
at around two hundred fifty hertz 			
Second spectral peek should be around two thousands hertz 			
So this is the usual configuration 			
 Let's see how it looks like 			
 ee ee okay 			
Oh that's just a minute 			
 ee ee 			
 That's good 			
This is an expanded we can see each uh each pitch pulse			
 each has a pulse here 			
And then the information uh of that you can pick up one			
glottal pulse 			
Okay it's a bit loud here and see it's			
 you can actually get the measurements of the what we call			
F one conventionally call F one that is the first spectral peak 			
and the second spectral peak you know here it may be difficult for you to			
follow let me change the colour 			
Okay okay this the spectral peak first spectral peak 			
and you can see the central point there and it is two forty hertz 			
that's the standard text book you saw two fifty hertz is the first			
spectral peak of the e 			
First form of the F one is at two fifty hertz 			
This is spectrum spectrum after you know you do this			
enhance for your analyses you get the spectrum 			
Then the second spectral peak is is here you can see it			
visually 			
This guy that is the second formant which will correspond this			
peak you know both of them are moving in the similar they are moving			
together both the cursors this two three six zero 			
This is again a text book case okay 			
If you look at ledger if you remember ledger of this chart of F			
one F two F three 			
And this third one has got a split there actually third and fourth			
are bit 			
Oh 			
Third and fourth is a are bit merged 			
I don't know I I think it shift aside yeah 			
Ah this is a better one yeah 			
Let me clear this uh let me clear this guy yeah 			
Now here see that the fourth spectral peak is here 			
Now there is the fourth formant 			
So first form and second third fourth first second third			
fourth okay 			
Now let's go back to the second spectral peak here 			
Remember it's two three two zero 			
Let me produce a an aa and see what			
happens to that aa aa aa 			
Yeah the F F three F two has come so low compared to 			
the this one it has come down to eight forty 			
So that F one F two F three F four the movement of these 			
you can see the each formant you can precisely measure not only by			
looking at this if you want much precise measurement you can do it by this			
spectrum 			
This is the spectrum of the signal at that red cursor 			
If you want spectrum of this signal over a period of time			
 you have another choice power between cursors 			
 It's a power actually okay 			
Now you need two cursors now power suppose I want to have an			
averaged spectrum of this I put the cursors there I simply press			
D it'll come there 			
So it's over a larger period 			
But you can even analyse pitch pulse by pulse here pulse by			
pulse you can analyse here 			
So ao characteristics of different vowels			
 could be analysed by looking at their formant characteristics 			
So today's uh recipe is the Punjabi dish we			
call alu ka parontha 			
It is one of uh the most favourite dishes can be used			
 to be eaten at breakfast or just at tea-time 			
It may be a little heavy for the ordinary people but I think			
 easy to make very tasty 			
Uh the ingredients that we use are mainly potatoes wheat			
flour green corriander leaves salt chilli powder to your taste			
 and green chilli 			
Take the potatoes boil them till they are absolutely soft			
Peel the potatoes mash them add the other ingredients 			
that is green corriander leaves cut them absolutely fine 			
add the salt according to your taste some chilli powder and			
a little of ajwain 			
Mix all these ingredients and prepare a ball of the mashed			
potatoes 			
Now this is the stuffing that we use for the 			
parontha 			
Regarding the wheat flour take enough quantity 			
for your guest take a little water and knead the flour by gradually			
adding the water to it 			
See be careful you know not to make the flour very soft			
the dough very soft nor very hard 			
It should be medium enough I mean easy enough to roll it			
out 			
Make small balls of the potato stuffing and also small balls			
of the dough 			
Roll out the dough into a little round shape 			
Yes in the shape of a small puri 			
Place the potato ball in the centre flatten it on			
the puri and now gradually cover it up with the dough			
It and it becomes into a flat little piece 			
Now roll this whole piece again out by applying a little			
of the dry wheat flour and rolling it with the rolling pin 			
The shape should be absolutely round the movements should be			
smooth and equal so that the potato stuffing also moves equally			
within the dough 			
Otherwise the edges will remain without the stuffing and they			
will be a little tasteless 			
Once you have rolled it out properly into the shape of a 			
chapati you may put it on to a heated tawa 			
Keep the gas at medium heat 			
When the first side of the chapati is ready			
you may turn it over let it cook for sometime 			
And now apply a little ghee or oil to the			
surface of the chapati 			
Turn it over apply a little ghee to the other			
side 			
And now keep moving the chapati from side to side			
 till it turns a little golden brown 			
This is your alu ka parontha 			
 I'm sure the aroma is coming 			
Well serve it to your guest along with it see that			
you add a little of home butter or Amul butter and then ask			
 your guest whether they enjoy it 			
Of course a little of curds will add to the taste of			
the whole dish 			
This is alu ka parontha 			
In this way you can prepare many other paronthas			
 also 			
They may be with the help of raddish they may be with the			
help of onion and cheese cottage cheese or even with the			
help of green leafy vegetables like palak 			
In the same way you can as you have used potatoes you may			
use the raddish that is grate the raddish squeeze the water out			
 use the same ingredients and then stuff it into the dough 			
As far as onion and cheese is concerned you may grate the			
onion into the wheat flour as well as the cheese and then knead			
the dough 			
And the similar method is used for green leafy vegetables like			
 palak or methi 			
Cut them finely wash them and knead them with the flour and you			
have a variety of paronthas either for tea or			
for breakfast 			
And one more 			
You have a dish called one word 			
Yes there are many other dishes there is no uh paucity of			
dishes where the Punjabis are concerned yes			
Now these are the simplest ones you can have uh what is			
known as chole bhature which is a very famous 			
uh Punjabi dish			
 One or two words 			
Right chole have to be soaked that			
is they are white gram they have to be soaked overnight and uh 			
so that they rise up and become soft by morning 			
You may grate or in a mixer you may mash about four big 			
onions 			
Fry these onions to a golden brown 			
Similarly add the juice of say about four tomatoes to			
these onions after it has become golden brown 			
Then you may add salt and uh chilli powder some of			
the spices which are also of course optional 			
And after you have added all these ingredients add tamarind			
water a cup of tamarind water 			
The chanas must be pre boiled and after			
all the ingredients have been cooked well there should be no smell of			
the onion remaining raw onion 			
You now add the chanas to the cooked 			
masala 			
Add a little warm water and let the gravy remain as thick as			
you would like it that is your personal taste 			
Regarding the bhaturas bhaturas are made out			
of maida or white flour 			
Like chanas they have to be prepared the previous			
 night the arrangement has to be done the previous night 			
The white flour is kneaded only in curds preferably 			
sour curd 			
Once it has been kneaded well and thick you don't have to make			
it soft you leave it overnight 			
And because of the sourness of the curds the flour rises up			
Next day you make small balls of this flour roll them up			
with a rolling pin and you deep fry them in oil on medium heat			
These are what are known as bhaturas and with			
 the chanas they form the dish chole bhature			
 			
Before serving them see that you cut fine rings of raw onion			
 long green chillies and a lots of fresh green corriander to			
serve with the dish 			
Uhm			
Anything more yes			
I do not know that punjabi dish and one or two words 			
about samosas and a few words 			
 Kachoris is from Gujrat			
Oh kachoris are uh uh chiefly Marawari			
dish			
Ahn			
Yes samosas are prepared universally			
Uh if you want in uh Punjabi you'll have then 			
dahi balle dahi balle is another dish which is typically			
Punjabi 			
Like the dahi wada 			
Yes similarly or if uh if we can say 			
 raitas are something which is totally in uh Punjabi 			
That is it is prepared with curds 			
Ordinarily people prefer even in the south to have curds			
directly but Punjabis would prefer to have curds with something in it			
Prefer that			
So we have a variety of raitas 			
You you may set a bowl of milk in the night to			
become into curds 			
In the morning you may put it into the mixer rotate it 			
and then you add a little salt chilli cumin powder and a			
little of powdered black salt to it as digestive 			
Then it depends on what you feel like eating that day which			
 raita you prefer 			
It may be potato raita it may be 			
cucumber raita it may be with corriander and			
chilli or what we know what is popularly known as kishmish			
ka raita 			
I think in English we will call kishmish 			
Raisin			
Raisin 			
Yes it is raisin 			
Now the difference between preparing of the other 			
raitas and raisin is that with raisin is that with raisin it is			
sweet and the other raitas are with salt and			
chilli 			
Now when we prepare the one with raisin you take about uh			
half a cup of raisin you soak them into warm water and leave them			
for sometime so that they get soaked 			
You put about four spoons big spoons of sugar into the curds 			
rotate it well uh one fourth spoon of salt one fourth spoon of			
 garam masala that is all spices crushed 			
Now that it is ready you squeeze out the raisin the 			
water from the raisin and you add it to the curds 			
This is a special dish generally prepared on occasions 			
because raisins are not very expensive now a days 			
So when you have uh what you would call a dawat			
 you would add the kishmish ka raita as one			
of the dishes to the others now things on the menu 			
The last uh dahi wada what's is			
like			
The dahi bhallas yes it is known as			
 dahi bhalla in bhalla in			
 Punjabi dahi wada universally all over India 			
yes 			
 Dahi wada 			
It can be made out of the mung dal 			
or the udad dal that is one is yellow in colour the other is			
white 			
Preferably it is the white one that is the udad dal			
 that is used 			
You soak the dal overnight you rotate it in			
the mixer mixer next day 			
And it has to become absolutely into a thick fine paste			
But the paste must not become thin 			
It should remain a little on the thick side 			
Once it is ready you grind a little cumin seeds you grind			
uh ginger and green chillies and add them to the ground udad			
dal 			
Then heat a little oil and make small balls of the udad			
dal and leave them into the oil 			
Keep turning them till they are a little golden brown and			
remove them onto a piece of paper so that the extra oil is drained off			
Now take a large quantity of curds mix it well beat it up			
well add salt chilli and also a little cumin powder to it 			
The bhallas which have been prepared should			
be soaked for atleast fifteen minutes in warm water 			
As a result all the oil is drained away into the warm water			
And you don't get that taste of oil when you put it into the curds			
Then soak it in the curds and allow it to stand for atleast			
fifteen minutes so that the curd penetrates into the bhalla			
 and softens them 			
Along with these it is always better to have chutney			
 			
This is known as khatti mithi chutney 			
You prepare it out of dates that is khajur			
 and out of tamarind water 			
Soak the tamarind for half an hour squeeze it out thick			
liquid add a little water sugar about half a spoon little			
salt chilli powder cumin powder and corriander powder to it 			
Mix it up beat it up well so that all the ingredients 			
form a thick paste like substance			
In the same way the dates are being soaked the seeds they			
have the seeds are removed and they are mashed with your hand and			
you they form an absolutely thick paste and to that you may add or you			
may not add a little salt and chilli powder and keep it aside so that			
when you serve the bhallas arrange them beautifully			
into a dish put a little curds over it add a little cha			
 khatti mithi chutney on the surface and a			
litlle fresh green corriander and serve it to your guests 			
Up till now we have seen the semi- poses and some			
other bends 			
Today we are showing you bharadwaja asana 			
Before going into the way of doing it I would like			
you all to see so that you can get the imprint of the 			
asana 			
You can look now into the pose music 			
This asana is dedicated to Sage Bharadwaja			
 the father of Drona the preceptor Kauravas and Pandavas who			
fought the great Mahabharata war 			
As you look at this pose it will tell you that we have 			
the forward movement and the extension backwards of the spine 			
But we do very little about the lateral movements of the spine 			
So this is the first primary asana to rotate			
the lateral muscles of the spine so that the spinal muscles on the			
side are strengthen so that it prevents what we call today the split			
disc cases 			
Now we go into the technique of the pose 			
First one has to sit in danda asana as you see			
Here the foot should be vertically doing tada asana			
 and the legs should be doing horizontal tada asana			
 			
So that the whole leg from the hips are like a stick 			
After sitting in that pose flex your knees move the			
feet towards the right feet placing the right foot over the left			
foot which gives a grip or a support or an anchor for			
rotating the spine to the maximum or optimum level 			
Again repeating reach the right hand towards the ceiling			
 extend the upper form from the right feet and revolve the trunk			
even maximum from forty-five to fifty or sixty degrees 			
Without disturbing the left knee and the hip so that			
the knee and the hip run parallel to each other 			
Then along with exhalation bring the right arm down 			
Form a cup shape then take the left hand back near the			
elbow and revolve using your behind as a friction 			
Revolve your spine from the pubic towards the right hand 			
and adjust your spine from the tail bone to the neck so that all			
the thirty-three vertebrates of the spine get an even rotation 			
Stay there with normal breathing lifting the lever up 			
and turn the diaphragm from the right to the left in order to feel the			
spine more 			
When you secure that pose bring the left arm behind			
the right and catch the right arm above the elbow and keep it			
like a stick the right arm facing the fingers against the ground			
inserting into the knees 			
Then pressurising your finger against the upper hand			
revolve the pubic the lowest trunk the middle trunk and the top			
trunk and stay at the left shoulder to the maximum 			
This gives you an idea that how the spine moves side			
ways more and more which relieves soreness of the back lumbago 			
one word hip pain and adjust the body in such a way that it			
lessens the pain and relieves it 			
Similarly the pose has to be done on the other side releasing			
the hand bringing it to the front take the right arm back come			
to danda asana 			
Stay for a while do normal breathe one or two then with			
an exhalation move the feet nearer flex in and move towards the left			
hip 			
Pressurising the knee on the ground walking the right outer			
knee and the right hip to keep them run parallel to each other 			
bring the left arm above stretch extend the body maximum 			
revolving the trunk towards the right arm to the maximum 			
Without retarding the rotation back bring the arm down			
along with the exhalation 			
Keep a cup cup shape move the right			
arm back and pressurising your foot against the other foot turn the			
lowest trunk to the maximum 			
Lock the ligaments of the knees 			
There they should be compressed in order to get the			
rotation 			
Revolve the spine to the maximum and set the kidney into the			
kidney so that the blood is sucked by the kidney for it to			
function better 			
I just see it's the simplest of all asana			
 but the effect is enormous 			
Any person who have got a slip disc can begin this pose like			
this before they attempt any other pose 			
Here the fibre which picks the spine is taken off 			
And it gives a tremendous relief on the back 			
Then with an exhalation move the left arm back and catch			
your leg no I'm sorry hold it catch your hand behind			
Extend the left arm to the floor using the finger to			
pressurise grip revolve the spin coming to shoulder the shoulder blade			
the kidney the weight even the bladder should be lifted up and then			
to be revolved 			
This is the final pose 			
Then you come back revolve release the finger 			
Take the left arm on the back side of the hip on the left 			
remove the leg to the front this is danda asana 			
When there is a back ache people having slip disc 			
it's very very difficult to do on this floor because they cannot			
 move their bodies at all 			
In order to make them get the mobility we make them to do			
on a chair which you are going to see now 			
You take a chair near you insert your legs on the path			
of your chair 			
Sit firmly on the seat 			
Then catching on one edge of the armpit supporting the			
elbow as you see keep the other hand behind grip the corner of			
seat pick the support of your outer knees will contact with the leg of			
the chair and turn your spine to the maximum 			
And this is a real panacea for people who have got salip			
disc or who are in the process of getting injury to their spine 			
one word of the spine 			
This can be done on the other way also			
Without changing the leg you turn and we revolve so			
that both side you can see this spine now better which has tremendous			
room because when we sit on a chair we have no compression of the			
spine 			
It gives a tremendous room for the spine to revolve or to			
rotate 			
Hence it is called the lateral rotation of the spinal movement of			
this arthrites 			
Those who have back aches strain or pa 			
 pain they can do this pose conveniently anywhere on the chair			
Your relief today is a permanent cure forever provided			
it is continued regularly 			
So keep this in mind as the doctor says take four			
doses a day if you do this pose with an interval of one hour every			
now and then the soreness of the thigh pad disappears and there is			
a tremendous freedom for the movement and you'll recover from			
the disease sooner than one anticipates namaskar god			
bless you 			
 Today namaskar today we are			
showing parshwathana asana 			
 As I said before it's good to have a look 			
into the pose to get a mental picture of parshwathana asana			
 			
 Now you can look at them music 			
 This is parshwathana asana parshwa means side			
 thana means stretch 			
 From there we go to prasavika padastha asana 			
 This is step pose to parshwathana aasana 			
 I hope you got a mental picture of 			
parshwathana asana and prasavika padastha asana 			
 Now we are going into the way of doing presenting this			
pose 			
 First we have to stand in tada asana as you see it			
 When we do tada asana remember that the bottom			
feet should be very very active the skin should be very sensitive at the			
bottom 			
 You know the pointer which you see that's the brain of			
the foot that should be circularly curved in order to get a firm			
grip which help the shin and the thymus to come in 			
 Then extending evenly from the middle of the arch we			
have to stand erect 			
 Then we do namaskar normally saluting to			
one to the other 			
 Namaskar this is how we salute the			
soul of the other person at the same time saluting our self 			
 It has to be done in the same way from behind 			
 Let the body turn 			
 Spread the palm take the pa join the palms to the back			
 allow the fingers upward and then raise the fingers to the maximum			
to reach the upper portion of the shoulder blade 			
 And join the palms firmly into the wrist 			
 Surely you have done that 			
 Now if you look at this lady you see the two triangles			
 evenly divided from the side of the chest to the lower and the			
forearm forming a right angle triangle 			
 So when a person presses the hands like that this perfect			
 double trikon asan as we followed 			
 In order to get it we have to press the wrist together and			
push the forearm muscles towards the elbows descending the upper			
arm down 			
 This is very good for dropping shoulder and drooping			
shoulder blade dislocated or displaced shoulder 			
 And normally people suffer from tennis shoulder tennis elbows			
tennis wrist were dependent get disturb of swollen 			
 They dis they remove their swelling and are afraid to			
hold their right hand to play again 			
 Come to this side 			
 Now the technique again 			
 Take a deep inhalation jump about four to four and half feet apart			
 Take the right foot out revolving the right foot forty-five to			
 ninety degrees 			
 The left foot about fifty to sixty degrees 			
 Turn the trunk maximum towards the right so that the body			
 experience on the middle of the right leg 			
 The middle of the right foot on the side the middle of			
the knee on the side the middle of the thigh on the side 			
 If you take the flying your navel your diaphragm centre			
 one word should run on the inner leg of the right 			
 Extending both legs backwards pressing the right heel on the			
floor extending the hinges of the heel of the right push back			
the right in order to woken the left leg 			
 Turn the pelvic rim of the left towards the right 			
 Open your chest do normal breathing 			
 When the breathing is not explained 			
 Pressing your palms throw the head back now if you			
achieve this pose it's called parshwauttana asana			
parshwa means side uttana means extension 			
 You can see the side legs side chest stretched 			
 So extending the side legs of the body or raising the side			
chest exhale go down 			
 When you are going down see that the navel is brought			
down to a vertical downward stretch of the navel 			
 Turn the left leg towards the right and move the right outer			
buttocks right outer buttocks towards the left leg 			
 So that both the buttocks run parallel to the back wall			
 Stretch your forehead on the knee if it is easy move			
the head down then the nose then the legs 			
 If you are secure stretching the outer edge of the left foot			
 from the ankle downward towards the ground which is a gripper 			
you have to turn the one word muscle of the left which is above the			
knee towards the right 			
 And extend this chin further down to rest on the shin 			
shin is a lower bone of the leg 			
 Then linken your body from the floor of the bladder 			
 You should have a single stretch from the tail bone towards			
the head 			
 Doing normal breathe in that position you can see the side			
legs working very accurately with full of life particularly the			
inner right leg 			
 Inhale come to the centre revolving the right foot again 			
turning the left foot out 			
 Stay there for a while in the centre 			
 Take one or two breath then with an exhalation move to the			
left turning the right foot in and the left foot out ninety degrees 			
 Before you raise your head secure the right outer foot on			
the platform firmly 			
 And then raise your head up from the trunk and extending			
this pelvic bladder from the right to the left lift up open			
your chest throw the head back with normal breathing 			
 Stay in that position for a while maintaining normal			
breath 			
 Then with an exhalation move the head down 			
 You saw the pose when the head is lifted the whole uritary			
organs were lifted up 			
 So one word for the one word or the			
looseness of the floor with the bladder there you get strengthen in this pose			
 Extend further and further if you know if you can do better 			
 Now pressing the left central heel of the flaw at the back 			
open the knees more and more towards your right legs 			
 And as the left leg moves back the right leg should give room 			
by creating space for a perfect stretch			
 You can see the clear triangle in the leg 			
 And maintaining the triangle as a form stay there for a while			
 Then after exhalation move the head to the centre turning the			
left foot in 			
 And stay there for a while 			
 Do normal breathing 			
 Then press this palms on the floor look up 			
 When you look up spread your leg more and more after 			
pressing the palm on the floor 			
 Without disturbing the pubic bone the physiological organ 			
from the pubic upto the neck has to be extended towards the collar			
bone 			
 Look up pressing the wrist 			
 This helps tremendously to take a deep inbreathe 			
without any strain 			
 When exhale take the head down 			
 Prasadita this is prasadita padasthana			
asana prasadita means extended pada means leg			
 as the legs are extended it is called prasadita pada uttana			
asana means the head is brought down the floor with an intense			
stretch 			
 So it is prasadita padasthana asana 			
 This is a base to begin shirsana 			
many people are afraid to do shirshana becuase they are			
afraid to keep their head down 			
 So this asana trains the brain to get			
acclimatise to keep the head to the ground then easily the confidence			
come and they can practise shirsana 			
 And this is a soothing both for the brain as the brain			
gets tremendous blood supply in this position 			
 In here we come up when you are staying in this pose you have			
to maintain normal breathing 			
 You can contract back begin the middle portion in the spine			
into the body as seen as place the fingers on your back exhale both			
together stand in tada asana 			
Hello I am Tabussum Khan and I love cooking 			
But cooking is not such a minor job as some people make it out to be			
Take for example the simple act of boiling an egg 			
If you don't know how to do it properly you can make a mess 			
Yuk if you want to avoid a mess like this then you must			
know some basic facts about eggs 			
Remember what you learnt at school ?			
Just inside this shell there is a membrane called the outer			
shell membrane 			
And at one end of the egg usually the broader end there			
is an air space enclosed by the outer shell membrane and the inner			
shell membrane 			
Now when you heat an egg this air space expands 			
And if you heat it rapidly the air space expands rapidly			
Since the volume is uh restricted by the shell the shell cracks			
 and the contents leak out 			
And this is the result 			
Now if you heat the egg slowly using a low flame then			
the air inside the air space expands slowly 			
The outer shell membrane is made up of methastheracin 			
protein the kind which you find in our skins and the air can escape			
out of the membrane towards the shell 			
The shell is calcium carbonate and it has very fine pores 			
The air can escape through these pores outside 			
Let me demonstrate demonstrates 			
Notice may I am not taking too much of water than			
is needed to immerse the egg 			
If there is too much of water then the convection current can			
take the egg up and down hitting it against the sides of the vessel 			
That can also lead to the cracking of the shell 			
Now a slow flame and a long wait music 			
The problem with this method is that it takes a very long time			
to have a hard boiled egg music 			
Now if I want to go to college in the morning I would			
definitely get late 			
So I have learnt a simple trick music 			
First I determine the approximate position of the air space			
inside the egg 			
Then using a sharp pin I make a tiny hole in the shell 			
just on top of the air space 			
Now I can get a hard boiled egg very fast music 			
The natural pores of the egg are too tiny compared to the hole			
that I have made and all the air can escape through that hole			
The result is a perfectly egg shaped egg when I feel it			
 music 			
Notice the difference in the shape of these two eggs 			
The flatness of the egg where there was an air space is not			
present in this one 			
Aesthetically more pleasing isn't it ?			
So there is no point in looking at the beauty of these eggs 			
unless we can eat them 			
And sometimes I find it very difficult to eat an egg 			
because of the smell 			
It reminds you of the chemistry laboratory which keeps			
apparatus and the horrible smell of hydrogen sulphide 			
Usually it's a rotten egg which smell of hydrogen sulphide			
But if after boiling it if you leave the egg in hot water 			
even a fresh egg can smell of hydrogen sulphide 			
To understand this phenomenon we must look into the contents			
 of the egg white music 			
The egg white is not actually white in colour until you boil or			
cook it 			
It is transparent and consists mainly of a globular protein			
called albumin 			
Protein as we know it is a long chain of amino-acids 			
Among the twenty odd amino acids which are normally found in			
protein there are three which have sulphur in them cystin 			
cystine and methionine 			
When the long chain of amino-acids folds on itself to form the			
globular tertiary structure quite a few hydrogen bond and a few S S			
bonds help to stabilize the structure 			
When we heat the albumin these bonds are broken 			
The protein settles out and undergoes what is known as denaturation			
Some of the S S bonds are also broken down and ultimately form			
 H 2 S which gives you that typical smell 			
The denatured protein then cross to into each other			
 and cogulate 			
This is how the albumin becomes white and opaque 			
The tendency of the liberated H 2 S is to move			
towards cooler areas that is towards the center of the egg where it comes			
into contact with the yolk and reacts with the metallic irons of the yolk			
to form a green coloured salt 			
Thus the yolk gets a coat of green 			
Personally I don't like the egg to smell nor do I like it to be			
green 			
So I'll tell you a simple trick to avoid both these			
problems music 			
As soon as the egg is boiled take it out of hot water and put			
it into cold water 			
And as I told you before the tendency of the liberated H 2			
 S is to diffuse towards cooler areas 			
So now instead of moving towards the center of the egg it			
will move out of the egg 			
So there will be no bad smell and no green coloured yolk 			
The problems arise only when you leave the egg in hot water			
Now we come to the last problem of dealing with hard boiled egg 			
The difficulty in peeling 			
Sometimes along with the egg shell the egg white also seems to come			
out 			
Actually this does not happen with all the eggs 			
Usually it comes up very easily 			
This only happens if you have a fresh egg 			
The solution to this problem is simple 			
Do not hard boil a fresh egg 			
The intermolecular forces between the shell membrane and the egg			
white are stronger in fresh egg 			
Within two three days of laying these bonds become weaker			
So if you want to have a hard boiled egg choose an older egg 			
 music 			
But if you want a fried egg it's better to go in for			
fresh egg 			
The intermolecular forces are stronger in fresh eggs 			
So you get a more compact looking fried egg 			
And if you use an older egg it tends to thin out into the pan			
and run and it becomes difficult to handle when you are turning			
it 			
So boil or scramble an older egg 			
I suppose we talked about fried egg the boiled egg the			
scrambled egg and the list is more than completed if we add omelette to it			
 music 			
The delicacy or the softness of an omelette may depend on how			
much of froth you manage to make when beating it 			
The method of beating the egg or the technology may			
contribute to the frothiness 			
But more important is that vessel in which you are beating			
the egg 			
I have cleaned this vessel very well with soapened water to			
remove all the grease from it 			
And in another vessel I apply a light coat of oil			
Now I take two egg from the same batch of eggs that I received			
 from the poultry farm this morning meaning that the age of both the			
eggs is the same 			
Now watch beating the egg 			
Notice there is not too much of froth in this vessel with the			
coat of oil in it whereas in this one there is a lot of froth 			
Why ?			
In the physics classes at school we have learnt about surface			
tension 			
Bubbles are more easily formed in water if we add soap to it			
 because soap produces the surface tension of water 			
If we apply this principle of surface tension to this phenomenon			
 you have solved another practical problem in your kitchen 			
Oil increases the surface tension			
So it is really necessary to clean the vessel thoroughly 			
before you beat the egg that is if you want a really soft omelette 			
In this programme we have eaten boiled eggs fried eggs scrambled			
eggs eggs made into an omelette 			
But I am sure we will have indigestion if we have any more of			
this stuff 			
So let me conclude this programme by merely mentioning the			
mouth watering delicacies in which eggs are used 			
Caramel custard pasteries cake meonade and a lot of			
these delicious stuff 			
And I'm sure a song in the praise of egg would include			
the voices to the from some of us who are			
vegetarian 			
But you wouldn't mind eating a so called vegetarian egg 			
A vegetarian egg is nothing else than unfertilised egg 			
There is of course no difference in taste between a fertilised egg			
and an unfertilised egg music 			
Hi Rajan 			
Hi 			
How are you ?			
Fine 			
 Kya hua again you have got pain in your			
 yeah shoulder base and neck 			
 Yeah 			
Yeah it's paining 			
Lal Sahab this is my brother Rajan 			
Hello jee 			
Hello nice meeting you 			
 In Hindi I think because of prolonged driving			
throughout the day he is driving around 			
Do you think you have any simple exercises for people who do a lot			
of driving ?			
Yeah sure 			
Could you please show us some ?			
Yes I'll show here itself 			
Here itself ?			
Yeah 			
Oh very nice laughter that will be very nice			
When you have to drive uh you know long distances perhaps			
you could do some exercises in between any time mean when you have 			
Oh that would be very nice in Hindi 			
If it pain or pressure okay			
Yes 			
Some are very simple which I will show you here unless			
you perhaps I'll show you more if you'll have time 			
One is this put your hands here on the seat breathing			
in you lift your body up and take your hand backward as high as			
you can 			
Here 			
The other exercise which you can do is put your hands here 			
right hand lift it up and then turn your head to the other side			
Breath in out down 			
Now breath in look 			
Yeah 			
 That's right clear breath in up 			
breath out breath in up breath out 			
Now another exercise what you can do is rotate your shoulder			
breathing in out out down 			
 It's very simple 			
 Breathing it up 			
Yeah it's very really all are very simple 			
Breath in up out as you reach down 			
Then forward 			
I hope this much you can manage 			
Yes I can already do it 			
 Is it all Lal Sahab 			
Yeah some are these and then there are plenty of			
exercises 			
Since the space is limited out here I am sure you can't			
do all the excersises here 			
Naturally			
Why don't we go and demonstrate some excercises for			
better endurance ?			
Sure			
Come 			
Bye bye 			
All skanda chalan can shoulder			
shrouds or skanda chalan can take off stress from your			
head and shoulders which come under heavy attack especially after			
prolonged driving 			
Simply breath in as you take your shoulder up and breath out			
as you bring them down 			
prolong driving affects your blood circulation very badly 			
These simple spinal twist up here accelerate blood supply to			
the whole system making you refreshed again 			
This is suptahastapadangosth asan 			
Very useful asan for relieving stress and			
strain from your entire back besides it also can take off extra			
flesh from your abdomen 			
Breathing in take your leg to the side out come back 			
You can repeat between seven and ten times in the first			
two weeks 			
This pawammukta asan is giving a natural			
massage to your entire system 			
You can stay there for as long as you feel comfortable 			
Press it very naturally 			
Don't strain yourself too much 			
You see during prolonged sitting and driving or travelling 			
your all the body joints almost are frozen specially your knees and			
the feet come under a heavy attack 			
Circulation is affected very badly 			
So these simple movements can relieve the pressure from your			
legs and the knees 			
Also if you have knee pain often or the knees are stiff even			
in a day to day life these simple movements further knees and the legs			
can help you come out of that uh situation 			
This is called vakra asan the simple spinal			
twist or the first position or preparatory exercise for 			
ardhmasendra asan 			
It gives a lateral movement to the entire spinal column 			
This can help you alleviate back ache and one word			
 etcetera 			
This is one of the constituent of surya namaskar 			
 called ashwa sanchalak one of the best 			
yogasan to relieve stress from your back head and neck 			
and shoulders 			
After having done all these yogasan and			
exercises you must relax in this position in Hindi 			
I think some of you who have seen the last programme would			
be ready with your sticks 			
So let's get started 			
As you remember last time you saw how the stick was held 			
and also saw a few basic steps and a few basic strokes with			
the stick 			
Now those of you who are familiar with the word 			
kaata or familiar with Judo or Karate would know what the			
word kaata means 			
But for those of you who do not know the word kaata 			
kaata is a fixed prearranged form of excercise done in 			
many marshal arts 			
It is either done solo or performed with a partner 			
These exercises are repeated till all the movements become			
smooth easy and spontaneous			
Now in stick fighting also we have got these fixed 			
or prearranged type of exercises 			
But because of the different styles involved and the			
different names at the moment for the sake of convenience 			
let's call them kaatas 			
Last time you saw Kanduraburakailugaru doing some basic			
steps			
Now let's take a look at him doing a few			
 kaatas 			
Here in this kaata only two strokes or hit			
 or I should say hit are being practised the right and			
the left but in different directions 			
Note that only these two basic strokes are used but in			
all the four directions of the one word 			
Incidently Guruburakailu is one of those few masters 			
who travel from village to village rarely staying more than a few months			
at one place 			
A few students pay him a small sum for his services but 			
mostly rice or wheat is the only payment he gets for			
teaching them 			
There he is finishing off the kaata 			
That is the traditional salami or salutation			
Now in this kaata he start 			
 starts the same way as before but uh this time with the			
stroke on the head 			
Two more strokes start from down two more parallel to the			
ground and a stroke towards the back then he turns 			
He does the same thing over again towards this side also			
Now he is finishing the fourth side and here he comes			
forward for the fifth time there he turns and goes back and			
finishes the exercise with uh traditional salutation or 			
salami 			
But before the salami he is doing the 			
basic strokes again 			
The salami usually is done before and after 			
each exercise in all the traditional art 			
Now this time he add a double stroke to the head and			
then does the same strokes which you saw in the last exercise 			
But he adds one more stroke from down which was a powerful stroke			
Then he turns 			
Here this is the powerful stroke which starts from down and			
ends up 			
Note how graceful and smooth the movements are 			
The synchronization of the movements the hormony between			
the hands and the feet 			
For this reason new movements are gradually introduced in			
each new exercise till all the movements become effortless and			
spontaneous 			
Well though there are more than twenty such exercises in			
the Udaygiri style we'll take a look at only one more 			
Well in this final kaata all the			
movements will be done in a circular way but before the movement			
starts a poke or a thrust repeats the movement 			
Watch he finished the circular strokes and now the			
thrust or the poke starts with the throat as the target 			
There it is the thrust and the circular movements 			
Note that the stick never seems to stop 			
It keeps on moving 			
This is in defence as well as in offence 			
The stick always covers the body 			
And that's it that's the salami			
 or the salutation 			
These are some basic exercises 			
After learning these the students learns how to hit			
 that means he learns the blows and the hits 			
Now here the need or the necessity of a partner is			
important 			
This is also done in a fixed prearranged form 			
The reason is that if it is not fixed and prearranged the			
 chances of injury are more 			
But gradually as the skill of the person increases 			
then he could indulge in free fightings 			
Loosening up or warming up Guruburakailu moves forward			
 to take the salami 			
This is his student Ramalingaraju 			
There they have done the salami and now			
they move back 			
Now he comes forward for the basic hits which are usually			
done before the start of each kaata 			
And now the exercise starts which has got nine hits 			
This time they do fifteen hits in this kaata			
 			
First the basic blows that's the deceptic			
 blow to the ankle 			
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven			
 twelve thirteen fourteen and fifteen 			
Now in this exercise other than the nine basic hits			
 there are twelve more hits which are added to this making a			
total of twenty-one strokes or blows sound of sticks 			
And they finish it off 			
Now comparatively this set is more difficult than the			
previous one though there are only four blows involved 			
The basic hit and the exercise starts one two 			
three four 			
Timing is very important in this 			
Ah that was the reverse stroke 			
Again 			
This exercise is also the same practically the same as before			
but uh instead of the first hit the first blow or the stroke is			
the thrust at the throat 			
And the same basic fourth blow 			
Rhythm and timing is very important here 			
There the rhythm has been changed to a double blow 			
from down 			
Now this kaata is similar to the last 			
two you saw but here there are ten hits rather than four			
blows which you saw 			
They have named it the Jhapak 			
Timing and a keen eye is very important here 			
Well we can go on and on for there are many such exercises			
but let's not do that 			
Uh we've to take a look at only one more 			
that's from the Udaygiricheda school 			
Here they are finishing this and now we'll move on			
to the last exercise 			
Here nothing is prearranged or planned or fixed 			
This is something like free fighting sparring and the			
hits are spontaneous 			
Now this type of practise or fighting is done when the			
student has already learnt the stick forms 			
This is helpful in the actual use of a stick that is 			
when a competitor fights 			
Though competitions are very rare now- a-days and they are only			
held in some villages and not in the cities 			
Uh in competition the stick is sometimes coloured so			
that if the stick touches it could show where it was touched 			
ah that was the close one 			
But the master is directing the students movement 			
Though there is a lot more to stick fighting than what you just saw			
These are a few kaatas from the Udaygiricheda			
school or the Udaygiri style of stick fighting 			
Now to some it may seem paradoxical but in many			
fighting arts of the east medicine and healing play a very			
important role 			
Many masters are vaidya hakims or bone setters			
One such master was the late Shafi ustad 			
The tradition is being carried out by his student Khalifa			
Gulam Rasool 			
Mending broken bones is his profession 			
He has learnt the secrets of herbs oil and healing			
lotions from his late master 			
And now he makes his own medicines 			
Gulam Rasool is a very busy man with a very tight schedule			
Right from dawn to late in the night he is at his			
clinic where he looks after his patients 			
Though sometimes when he is not very busy he teaches 			
stick fighting also 			
No matter what ones faith is devotion and prayer play an			
important part in ones training 			
Here Khalifa Gulam Rasool gets ready for an exercise 			
 That's the salami and he starts with			
both the sticks rotating 			
This exercise is known as chaadar or a			
bedsheet 			
It is appropriately named because uh sticks are covering			
the body like a bedsheet would 			
Both the sticks are moving at the same time 			
This is used to keep people away from you 			
And the that's the finish of the exercise with the 			
traditional salami 			
Gulam Rasool's son Gulam Moiuddin is on the left 			
and Karim is on the right 			
They are doing salami 			
And now the work starts 			
This is the simple exercise with just four hits 			
There they finish off 			
Now here is something interesting 			
Other than blows and thrust which you saw in the Udaygiri			
style here the lathi or the stick is also used 			
to lock the joints and immobolize the opponent without actually hitting			
him 			
These are known as bandish or 			
let's call them locks 			
Here the elbow has been locked 			
Abdul Samadh his student and the elbow and the			
shoulder is locked here 			
The wrist also seems to be locked 			
That is a good one the elbow has been locked 			
 That's sure it's painful the neck has been			
locked 			
Now there are two sticks being used 			
Well one arm the other arm has also been locked 			
Both the arms are captured 			
Well that's the strangle or a choke on			
the throat with the elbow also locked 			
You have seen two different styles or types of stick			
fightings 			
Now I would like to show you a few basics which could be			
learnt easily by you and put to good use if the situation demands			
But let me tell you something 			
Do not misuse the sticks give it the respect it deserves			
But uh before we start let's take a look at			
what we did last time 			
In various styles there are various hits and blows			
But basically there are just seven hits with the stick			
 I'll do them slowly 			
From your basic stance lift your hands up and get your			
hands down again 			
This is the first basic hit on the head 			
It comes straight down 			
The second hit is sloping from up to down 			
The third again from up to down slanting 			
Fourth is parallel to the ground fifth is also parallel			
to the ground sixth comes from down to up and seventh is also			
 from down to up 			
And of course there are point of the stick is also			
used to thrust or poke 			
What you saw were the seven basic strokes 			
Now I'll show you a simple basic exercise 			
Now usually in stick fighting when the stick is			
brought over head or from the side the leg also moves with the			
stick that is what I am trying to say is that if the stick comes			
from your right side the leg also moves forward or if it comes			
from the left side then the left leg moves forward 			
Now this is not a very hard and fast rule 			
It is flexible 			
Sometimes even when the stroke is coming from the other			
side the step may not be taken that is the right leg is in			
front but the left stroke comes 			
Let us not think of this at the moment 			
At the moment when we get the stick out we will 			
step forward 			
So from here from your basic start or your basic stance 			
lift your hands up over your head 			
Now in this movement you have blocked the opponents stick			
 or you have blocked a blow to your head and protected			
yourself 			
From here take a step forward hit 			
Take one more step forward hit 			
Now what happens you can rotate to the left side or the			
right side or the back 			
Now I'll move to the left watch 			
Again I'll go towards my back 			
What I have done is that I have taken a complete circle 			
Now this circle could be towards your left side or			
towards your right side depending on the situation 			
 I'll do it again slowly watch 			
Well that speed also is possible but to start with 			
we'll do it slowly 			
Now what you have just seen is just a fraction of what			
 stick fighting is all about 			
If you are really interested then it's better			
that you find someone who knows stick fighting and who can teach			
you 			
Here I remember the saying of the late Swami			
Shivananda who says An ounce of practice is worth 			
several tons of theory goodbye 			
I first became interested in fabric painting when I saw it			
 advertised in a magazine 			
So I went out and got a whole lot of colours and uhm I			
first started out by painting on pieces of pa on pieces of			
uh cloth 			
I took the designs from magazines from uhm cards 			
and uh sometimes I just used my own free style design 			
Then uhm I started uh painting 			
Now this is a pillow case 			
 I've done a few designs on this pillow case with fabric			
paints			
In the beginning I diluted it very thickly didn't use much			
water			
So it's come a bit crudely 			
It hasn't come very well 			
So uhm I decided to dilute the paint a little more 			
and make the colour more refined 			
Now I use all sorts of colours like blue green yellow 			
violet indigo black white on black 			
You can use any colour on any kind of cloth and the results			
are fantastic			
Now have a look at this bedsheet 			
This is something I tried quite recently 			
This is a mixture of all sorts of ideas 			
 I've taken it's some kind of ink freaking 			
You can do the same sort of thing on paper			
Take a piece of string dip it in ink put it between two			
pieces of paper flatten it the paper and pull it out			
slowly 			
Now the same idea has been applied on this bedsheet 			
But the string I have taken is slightly thicker and I have			
streaked the bedsheet all over and then the results that you can see			
are fantastic 			
It has given it a very printed kind of look and uhm very			
professional 			
And not only that I spray painted all over the bedsheet 			
with different colours and I've used enough stensils to			
mark a ki kind of outline all round			
the end of the bedsheet 			
So uhm the effect is quite good actually 			
Now uh this was just a trial actually starting with sort of			
bedsheet because bedsheets aren't very expensive 			
Now here is another piece of cloth 			
This is a dress material 			
I have decided to go a step further and try out this kind of fabric			
painting on dress material 			
I have done the same sort of thing but I've used uhm			
 cut out moulds 			
The moulds are potatoes and ladysfingers 			
These can be used as moulds for printing in different colours all			
over the material and I've also spray painted the material 			
and streaked it 			
You can even draw your own little stars here and there and see			
like this and uhm the results are quite good 			
Now all that has to be done with this material is to be cut out			
and sewn into a dress 			
I still haven't tried making a dress out of it yet but uh 			
once I do it the results are good enough I am going to start selling them			
And I am sure the market is going to be quite good for this kind of			
stuff because its quite original and I don't think anyone has quite			
tried this sort of thing before 			
You can do almost anything with fabric painting			
You can paint curtains you can paint bedsheets you can			
paint uhm dress-material handkerchiefs pillow covers 			
table-cloths 			
All sorts of things you use around the house even like uhm 			
just little designs wall designs to hang on the walls and anything			
else you fancy actually 			
Uhm so uh fabric painting is fast becoming quite			
popular especially for curtains and other things used around the house			
But this is the first time I am trying fabric painting on			
dresses 			
People have tried it before on uh T-shirts and uhm 			
other things but I am going to start something new now I am going to start			
fabric painting on Jeans and other articles which haven't been			
painted so far 			
Now uhm this is a pair of Jeans 			
The modern trend is not to wear Jeans that are flawlessly clean			
But rather to be speckled with all sorts of colours and paints			
and uh patches 			
In other words Jeans are fashionably dirty these days 			
People prefer to wear them dirty 			
Now instead of making Jeans dirty I think a better idea would			
be to paint the dirt on 			
But not exactly paint the dirt on we would rather paint			
patches on or paint little things on it or even use stensils or			
potatoes and ladysfingers 			
You won't believe that a pair of Jeans could be made to look like			
this 			
Now this looks as though it has been done in a factory			
 and uh I have tried selling a few of these dress and few of this			
 some of the dress-material before and uhm the prices are people			
are willing to pay a fair quite good prices for this sort of things 			
They don't get this kind of print on material which they can			
buy which they buy in the shop 			
And uhm well they are willing to pay quite well for it 			
Now these are some curtains 			
I have hung them up in my bedroom here 			
See how the outline has been carefully sketched on to the			
curtains first 			
These are not quite finished 			
But the outline has been sketched 			
Now what I have to do is yes since it's been done			
with carbon paper 			
Now uhm I have to paint the outline and then 			
paint it in 			
I also get ideas for my designs from a monthly			
subscription for a magazine they send pamphlets 			
Small pamphlets with different designs in it that can be used to			
 fabric painting 			
And the designs are quite originals in them			
You can draw animals or flowers or just abstract designs			
 you can spray paint you can use strings of one word 			
If you have a good imagination sky is the limit you can do anything			
Now here is another thing 			
Here is a bag 			
This handbag is made of denim and it has been painted 			
with fabric paints 			
There are special types of paints we use for this kind of painting			
They are camlin wat uh they are not exactly water			
colours they are fevicraft 			
They are called fevicraft colours and they are available in a			
wide range of colours they should be diluted quite a bit and you can			
paint 			
See how I have done this bag 			
The result is astonishing 			
Not only can you paint bags and other pieces of cloth but you			
can also paint vessels infact anything that you use around the house			
You can paint practically anything 			
You can paint claypots 			
You can do all sorts of designs on clay-pots even Egyptian			
designs like the old Egyptian urns Greek designs like Graceo urns 			
and uhm they will make wonderful ornaments put all over the house 			
Then uhm some people so 			
some people just come and ask me to paint things on any object			
They bring either pieces of cloths or some a 			
pie a piece of cloth they want to make into something			
or any sort of cloth actually plus different sorts of articles 			
You can even paint uh vehicles like bikes 			
You can do all sorts of designs on a bike 			
And uhm this is becoming quite a fad these days with the			
younger generation specially people in colleges because they go in for			
all sorts of crazy things on their bikes these days like stickers and other			
things 			
And fabric painting happens to stay 			
It stays on bike for a much longer time 			
It doesn't come off like a sticker 			
Not only can you do fabric painting on all these things you			
can also paint canvas shoes 			
You will be amazed at the sort of things you can paint on canvas			
shoes 			
You can totally change the colour of plain white canvas shoes 			
You can make them look very trendy and very fashionable by 			
painting almost anything on them from your relations to all sorts of			
exotic designs 			
You can paint towels skirts jackets 			
Denim jackets are another fashion these days with fabric painting			
People go in for all sorts of things written on the back of			
their denim jackets			
Here is one 			
This one somebody gave me and told me what to write on it 			
So I have painted it the way that person wanted 			
I take orders sometimes but mainly I use my own imaginations			
 and I normally do exactly as I feel like			
I let my imagination run wild sometimes and the results are			
usually very good 			
They are impressive 			
And lot of people like my work and uhm here all the things			
in front of you 			
 It's quite an array here and uhm it's 			
 these are most of the things you can uh use fabric paints on 			
I am sure other people with good imaginations can think of			
many more things from fabric paints 			
And uhm that's about it the fabric paints 			
So this is how fabric paints can be used 			
Hello there today's topic home-made			
cosmetics 			
Out of the fifty or more cosmetics that are available today we			
have selected a few for your preparations at home 			
The accent has been on easy availability and processing 			
Please have your books and pens ready so that you can note			
down the formulae and procedure that are going to be flashed up on to the			
screen 			
Follow the safety precautions to the best of your ability so			
that you can get serviceable and usable material 			
Many people say the use of cosmetics is a luxury 			
Others are equally voceferous that it is important for			
personality development and en enhancement 			
 			
We leave it to you to decide 			
But have your books and pens ready and for your			
information cosmetics is derived from the Greek word cosmeticos			
 meaning skill in decorating 			
Another meaning for the word cosmos is ornament 			
And as you know cosmos also means the whole universe			
So the supporters of cosmetics say that the scope is wide			
ranging and far reaching 			
Now professor Sai Prakash will tell you more about this			
Let us start with the first procedure of preparing a			
cleansing cream 			
Historically one of the earliest creams was prepared by 			
jaily around the year one thirty-two hundred A D 			
And he was one of the famous physicians of that particular			
time next only to Hippocritis 			
His cooling ointment called Serateem refrigeran 			
they call into a present cleansing cream has the basic ingredient			
 bees wax olive olive oil rose water etcetera 			
And the combination of this cleansing cream even to this			
day is almost similar 			
In chart one you have the basic ingredients present in a			
cleansing cream like bees wax mineral oil or vegetable oil as			
given in part B of the chart water and borax 			
These are the ingredients with which you can prepare uh a			
simple cleansing cream at home 			
And the purpose of this pa 			
particular cleansing cream is to remove oil grime 			
facial make-up etcetera from face or throat or other parts of the			
body 			
And other creams such as uh vanishing cream hand			
cream or one word creams are prepared with this basic			
formulation 			
We have the method of preparation in the flow diagram given			
in chart two 			
And uh in the chart you see that we have uh bees			
wax and mineral oil taken together melted and heated upto seventy			
degree so that the wax melts and we have a homogeneous solution 			
Borax taken in water dissolved in water and once again			
heated to seventy degree so that both these reacting 			
Bees wax in mineral oil Borax in water are at seventy degree			
 and they are mixed up slowly 			
Borax in water being added to this bees wax oil			
composition slowly with continuous stirring 			
And when all the ingredient has been added you stir			
vigorously and allow the temperature to cool down			
When it comes to around fifty degrees or so you add uh uh			
perfume of your choice 			
 It's because one has to be very selective in adding			
 perfume because the choice varies from person to person 			
A suitable perfume can be added and then the temperature			
brought down further 			
At this stage you see that the whole thing emulsifies 			
and you get the cold or one word cream of your choice 			
Now the procedure is very simple and uh we will be doing that			
particular experiment now 			
Here we have bees wax it is made into small chips uhm			
 when it is marketed it's of this particular shape 			
This is done to see that it melts easily and this has			
this has got to be dissolved in mineral oil 			
Here is the mineral oil sample 			
I am going to pour this into a beaker and uh the			
quantities are as given in the chart the same poportion being taken 			
This is the mineral oil transfered into a beaker and then			
 the beas wax is crushed into this utensil 			
And uh we have a set up of uh I'll 			
take it out with the help of a glassrod 			
After tranfering bees wax into mineral oil we now take			
 borax and dissolve it in the wa dissolve it in			
water for according to the quantities given 			
And then heat these two ingredients to seventy degrees			
And I have the set up here the heater and then uh water			
inside and that water is getting heated up 			
I now transfer this beaker into the water bowl			
 arrangement I have made and also the borax water 			
combination 			
Borax dissolves and we now have to heat it to seventy degrees			
Now if you are doing it at home and if you don't have 			
thermometer with you you can as well take seventy degrees as an			
approxiamate temperature when vapours just start coming out 			
Now that the temperature has come to seventy degrees we			
 remove these to and I place at top bees wax borax or			
bees wax and mineral oil combination 			
And I start adding borax water mixture slowly 			
with uh continuous stirring 			
You see a sudden change and a sort of a emulsion forming			
 and this is done under hot conditions both of them at			
seventy degrees 			
Initially both these solutions were colourless now we			
will get a beautiful cream and I add the whole thing and			
 stirr it vigorously 			
You can take the one word surely it's 			
different beautiful cream that is prepared 			
Suddenly pain in the chest occurs unexplained sweating is here			
 and breathlessness may be there and suddenly or within a few			
hours or the same day at any time a person can die suddenly 			
Now this death when we say death this is apparent death 			
and this is uh clinical death there are various names for it 			
It means that the heart has stopped beating say and			
there is no respiration the person is not breathing 			
So that is but the brain is still functioning 			
So till the brain is functioning the man is not dead 			
He is not really dead so he is not biologically dead 			
So that period is only about four minutes or so 			
If during this four period of four minutes before the 			
 br brain death occurs we can revive the			
person we can make his heart beat again and his respiration come up again			
 then the man can be revived and he survives 			
Now it has been this period of four minutes is too short 			
for any doctor to reach any place because th 			
this sort of death can occur at any situation 			
You are in the factory you are in the office you are in the			
college wherever you are you see wherever you are on the road side 			
this sort of thing can happen at any time 			
Now when it happens and there no doctor can reach to do			
anything 			
So it is the passerby the standers-by the people in the house			
 who can do everything to save the life and follow the			
technique of C P R that is cardio pulmonary resuscitation			
It is a very very simple technique and anybody can learn it			
 music for sometime 			
So friends we'll just learn the technique of			
cardio pulmonary resuscitation 			
By cardio I mean heart pulmonary means lungs and			
resuscitation means revival 			
Learning the technique of reviving heart and lungs when it			
fails is what we call as cardio pulmonary resuscitation 			
Before we actually learn what is C P R or cardio pulmonary			
resuscitation is it's uh imperative that we should know as			
to where the heart is situated and what exactly is its function 			
That heart is just like a size of the fist and is situated			
in the centre of the chest with the strenum or the breast bone in			
front and the spine or the backbone behind 			
And uh it pumps the blood to all the tissues of the body 			
almost trillions of cells of the body and the main target organs like			
brain which is the master controlling function of the body the			
kidneys liver and heart itself 			
If the heart fails that is the pumping action fails the			
death ensues 			
And this death is of two types a clinical death or what			
we call a temporary death and a biological death or a permanent			
death 			
The time interval between this temporary death and the			
permanent death is just four to five minutes 			
It is this time interval which is crucial and we have to take			
all the measures of C P R at this junture 			
Now before we learn the technique of C P R it is very very			
essential for us to know is the individual alive or dead 			
If alive is he sleeping or he is unconscious and there			
are certain parameters by which we can easily determine whether the			
individual is dead or alive 			
Like for example we must try to say ask some question to			
the patient are you okay ?			
If he is not if it there is no response then we can just			
pinch the skin or we can press over the upper portion of the eyes we			
can just have a deep pressure 			
If there is no response that means the individual is not 			
uh not in a sleeping state but he is unconscious or he may be dead 			
Now how to distinguish whether he is dead or he is			
unconscious 			
We can easily see the chest movements or the breathing			
movements 			
If a person is unconscious we can see there is a breathing movement			
or you can bring the palm of your hand and put it just in front of the			
nostrills or over the uh mouth and we can fe 			
 feel some warmth of the air 			
Or we can just bring the cheek in front of the mouth and			
the nose			
And if we can feel the warmth of the air we can say that			
the individual is unconscious but not dead 			
And the third thing commonly which we should feel is we can see			
the carotids the one of the arteries which is very close to the adams			
apple or what we call as the voice box or a sound box there is a groove			
on the side of this apple 			
Uh this uh uh adams apple we can just feel the			
pulsation 			
If we can feel the pulsation we can say that the individual is			
unconscious but not dead 			
If you are not able to perceive the pulsation and we say there			
are no chest movements no signs of respiration and uhm uh pulsation or			
heart pulsation we can say that the individual is dead 			
And then we have to keep certain do's and			
 don'ts in mind 			
For example we should never try to keep a pillow under the			
head 			
Now why it is so ?			
The principle is I'll just explain you 			
Whenever a individual breathes he breathes either from the nostrils			
or from the mouth and whatever air he inhales it goes through the			
windpipe and goes into the lungs and the air which is inhaled goes			
into the windpipe and the lungs expand and the chest moves 			
If for example we just keep for example we are keeping a			
pillow under the head this windpipe is obstructed and there is a			
narrowing of the windpipe			
You can see here this red one this is windpipe it gets choked			
 and there is no free passage of air into the windpipe and an			
individual instead of saving him he can just uh go into a sudden death			
So we must make an effort never to put any pillow under the head			
The second thing which we must keep in mind we can put any			
pillow or anything under the legs 			
By doing so wi with the effect			
of gravitation we can push in atleast two to three bottles			
of blood into the brain 			
And just by doing so a patient may have a enough circulation			
in the brain and he can be easily revived 			
Just by a simple technique of raising the legs or raising			
the pelvis of an individual 			
The third thing we must never put in any water or any			
 sol any solid in the individuals mouth 			
There is a risk as the individual is either in a temporory			
death or in a permanent death whatever you put in the mouth will go into			
the windpipe and the windpipe will get choked and there will not be any			
passage of air into the windpipe and person may die suddenly 			
If at all we find that there is any vomitous or there are			
any secretions any throat secretions lying in the mouth or there is some			
foreign body or there is a uh food material or there is water			
accumulated in the mouth our effort should be to put in the finger 			
and wipe out the whole mouth and keep the patient or the individual			
 uh head on the lateral side either on the right side or the left			
side whatever is a convenient 			
The next thing which we must keep in mind is we must assure			
 that there is not a inch of crowd around the individual if			
there is a lot of crowd we obstruct the air to go into the patients			
uh vicinity			
And we should see that there is a free entry of air into the			
individual or who is a victim who is almost in a process of death 			
So these are certain do's and 			
don'ts which we must keep in mind			
Once we do so and we find that still there are no signs			
of life then we should start the technique of what we call as C			
P R or cardio pulmonary resuscitation and uh this can be remembered			
 by simple words of A B and C			
By A I mean airway and B is breathing and C 			
means circulation 			
Once I say A A airway means how to take care of the airway			
 and B is breathing is the process or the method by which we can			
blow air into the individuals lungs to give him life and C is the			
circulation that the technique by which we can revive the heart which			
has failed so as to achieve the circulation in the brain and all the vital			
top parts of the body 			
This is what I meant by A B and C 			
Now how to do this technique of A B and C we'll			
 learn in a step wise fashion 			
The first and the foremost A means care of the airway			
Our aim is to keep this windpipe which you have already seen			
 in that model 			
But we must see the patency of the airway or the windpipe 			
So we have to keep the victim's position in that			
fashion so that the windpipe is absolutely patent and we can do			
so by chin lift or head tilt position 			
Means we can give this you have to elevate the chin and just			
 you have to press back the forehead of the individual 			
By doing this doing so like chin lift and head tilt position the			
wind pipe becomes absolutely patent 			
This is what I mean by A			
It is very very simple anybody can learn it 			
And just by doing so atleast twenty percent of the lives can be			
saved 			
 It's such a simple technique 			
And after doing so if you find there are any signs of 			
breathing or any signs of circulation then we are not to worry much			
about it 			
And if you find there are no signs of respirations and			
there is no signs of uh circulation we should start with another			
step of B what we call as breathing 			
Now this breathing can be uh learnt in two ways 			
Like uh we can give either a mouth to mouth breathing or a			
mouth to nose breathing 			
And one should never feel shy that may be of a opposite sex			
may be a male female may be young or a old individual			
Our aims and objective is only one and that is to save the			
life irrespective of the sex and irrespective of the age of an individual			
And this can be achieved by bringing our lips in front of			
the victim's lips and make it a absolutely airtight			
seal so that when we blow the air into the patient into the 			
victim's mouth it goes straight away into the lungs 			
And we must ensure before doing so that we keep the 			
individual's position in the chin lift and the head tilt position 			
And the second thing is whenever we blow air into the 			
individual's mouth we must clinch at the nostrils 			
If we do not do so then whatever air is blown into the 			
individual's mouth will leak out from the nose and we will not			
achieve the goal 			
 It's very very important and simultanously we must watch			
for the chest movements that is our technique or procedure of giving			
the air is alright 			
And if it is not so you will see there are no chest movements 			
or there is some leakage of air either from the sides of the lips or			
from the nostrils 			
And this can be done suppose for example if I am alone 			
there is only one rescuer instead of two then we have to give a			
mouth to mouth breathing by chin lift head tilt position clinch the			
nostrils and bring your mouth so you have to give sudden 			
short blow of breath into the individual's or victim's			
 mouth 			
For example if there is a fracture or there is a bleeding from			
the mouth or there is a vomitous or there is some foul smelling			
coming from the mouth then you can start with mouth to nostril breathing			
And our aim is again same our objective is same that we have to			
keep the individual's position in the same fashion chin			
lift and head tilt position 			
And we have to see that the mouth is closed when we give a 			
mouth to nostril breathing like this 			
Once you do so we must always watch for the chest movements			
If our technique is right the chest will move and we will			
be sure that we have given the blow or breath exactly into the wind-pipe			
 That's how the lungs expanded and the chest moved 			
Once you do so and we find there are still no sings of			
breathing there are no signs of uh circulation we start with C 			
By C I mean circulation 			
Now how to achieve the circulation			
The technique is very very simple 			
Like for example you can use your middle finger and the index			
finger you can keep it exactly in the centre of the lower chest 			
There is a notch here 			
If you see here carefully that is a notch 			
Here the two halves of the two halves of the chest bony			
cage they meet			
This is the notch here you have to keep your fingers the			
index finger and the middle finger 			
Bring the palm of the other hand and keep it over the breast			
bone 			
Remove this hand and put it over the other hand and			
interlock it 			
And you have to make sure that you give this procedure of			
what we call as heart massage or what we call as compressions over			
the heart to revive it 			
You have to see that you just lie absolutely in a straight			
position you do not bend your elbow joints and you give enough			
pressure so that there is a compression of about half inch 			
to one and a half inch just indepth 			
We should not go beyond that 			
And you can start giving compression			
Like for example you can give compressions like this one			
thosand one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four			
 one thousand five one thousand six one thousand seven one			
thousand eight one thousand nine one thousand ten one thousand			
eleven one thousand twelve one thousand thirteen one thousand			
fourteen one thousand fifteen and after doing so straight away			
start the same position chin lift head tilt position clinch the nose			
 and give mouth to mouth breathing 			
Then continue this procedure till you see the signs of			
life in the form of respiration or in the form of uh uh circulation			
achieved 			
If you find that still no signs of respirations we must			
continue the technique till we feel the carotids artery here main			
artery here or we see some sort of breathing and the pa or			
 some sort of regaining of consciousness			
If it is not there we have to continue it there are certain			
things which we have to keep in mind when we do this technique of what			
we call as a close cardiac massage or a compression 			
I am told I have coronary artery disease what does it 			
it actual actually mean ?			
You see normally your heart requires inadequate			
supply of blood 			
Right			
To enable it to perform its function of pumping blood to			
the body 			
Now this blood it receives through three major arteries 			
which as you see on this model			
Yeah			
Goes on the surface of the heart 			
Right 			
When these arteries get blocked the process is known			
as atherosclerosis 			
Uhm uhm			
Then the blood supply to the heart suffers 			
And when this occurs during periods of stress the			
diminished blood supply to the heart manifests as pain 			
Uhm			
Which is called angina 			
So if one of these vessels were to get suddenly completely			
blocked 			
I see 			
Then a portion of the heart muscle would die 			
Oh 			
And this is called miocardial infarction or in 			
layman's term a heart attack 			
And therefore why does this disease occur ?			
Nobody really knows the exact cause for this disease 			
I see 			
But medical science has been able to identify certain			
risk factors which predispose a patient for this disease			
Uhm 			
Of these risk factors one of the important ones is			
smoking 			
Oh 			
The other risk factors are diabetes hypertension			
 a high cholestrol diet belonging to the male sex and a			
strong family history 			
For example if your father or brother were to have pulmonary			
artery disease ahn hn hn then the risk of having this			
disease is increased 			
 Ahn hn hn 			
How do you confirm that uh an individual has got the			
disease ?			
You see initial investigations like a chest X-ray and			
an E C G ahn ahn which should be performed by a private			
practitioner would give a clue to the existence of this disease 			
 ahn 			
But the actual confirmation that one has this disease can			
be made only by taking recourse to certain sophisticated investigations			
 Ahn ahn 			
 Ahn 			
Right 			
And the first of this is called an exercise			
electrocardiogram 			
Uhm uhm 			
In this a continuous record of the patient's 			
electrocardiogram is taken while he is subjected to graded exercise 			
Right 			
And this gives us an idea of the capacity of the heart			
 to cope up with the exercise 			
Right 			
And if the heart is unable to do so uhm uhm 			
then this manifests as chest pain or as changes in the			
electrocardiogram which is recorded uhm uhm or as a			
rise in the blood pressure 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Nuclear anginography is another recent innovation in			
modern medicine I see which helps us to further define			
the function of the heart 			
And in this a radioactive drug is injected into the blood			
stream 			
 I see 			
Right 			
This accumulates in the heart and is picked up by			
sensitive sensors 			
Uhm uhm 			
This gives us an idea of the exact amount of blood being			
 pumped by the heart during each beat 			
Uhm uhm 			
It also tells us that the certain portions of the heart			
 are not contracting properly uhm uhm or there are			
certain areas of the heart which are receiving less blood supply 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Right 			
The final diagnosis of course can be made after			
a test called coronary archiography angiography 			
Uhm uhm 			
And this is the test which is performed under local			
anaesthesia by the cardiologist and radiologist 			
Uhm uhm 			
And in this test a cathater is passed through the			
femoral artery which is the blood vessel supplying the leg 			
Right 			
This cathater is pushed into the heart uhm 			
and the radio opaque dye is injected into the heart and the coronary			
arteries 			
 Uhm 			
Right 			
This tells us firstly the function of the heart 			
uhm uhm as well as delineates the anatomy of the coronary arteries			
 uhm and shows us exactly where the disease process is			
blocking the arteries 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Uhm 			
Uhm 			
This not only confirms the diagnosis for us uhm			
uhm but it also tells us whether surgery is feasible and			
if so uhm which portion of the artery should be repaired			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Uhm 			
I see 			
So what is this bypass surgery ?			
You see in bypass surgery our aim is to increase			
the blood supply to the heart by surgical methods 			
I see 			
There are two ways to tackle this disease 			
One is by giving medicines 			
Uhm uhm 			
However medicines can only improve the blood supply 			
to the heart marginally 			
Uhm uhm 			
They mainly act by reducing the demands of the heart			
 uhm and thereby the work capacity of the patient is			
now significantly increased 			
 Uhm 			
Oh 			
In bypass surgery we aim to actually increase the blood			
 supply to the heart by creating bypass channels surgically 			
Right 			
Thereby not only the capacity of the heart is increased 			
 uhm uhm but the capacity of the patient to lead a normal			
active life right is increased 			
 Uhm uhm 			
 Right 			
I see 			
But what do you exactly do during this bypass surgery ?			
I mean 			
The exact surgical procedure is difficult to explain 			
Uhm uhm 			
But I have a video recording of a bypass surgery 			
uhm uhm in progress 			
 Uhm uhm 			
Oh 			
If you would like to see it ?			
I will show it to you 			
Ah ha certainly love to 			
You are looking into an operation theatre 			
The preparations for a coronary artery bypass procedure up in the			
way 			
The patient suffers background noise from coronary artery			
disease and requires bypass graft of the blocked artery all the			
perfusionists the nurses and the anaesthetists get ready			
The patient is put under anaesthesia 			
The chest and the leg are draped in sterile towels 			
To expose the heart the skin overlying the breast bone			
 is cut 			
The underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue are then			
divided to expose the breast bone 			
Which is then cut through with an electric saw 			
The procedure called sternotomy noise of sawing 			
The heart is covered by a membranous sheet called the			
pericordium and when this is cut the first view of the heart			
beating underneath is accorded 			
Meanwhile another set of surgeons has exposed the			
long vein of the leg known as the saphenous vein 			
Portions of this vein will be used as conduits by bypass			
graphs cough 			
When this has been done the stage is set to connect the			
heart to the heart lung machine 			
This machine will perform the function of the heart and lung			
 during the entire procedure 			
So this blood must be drained from the heart to the heart			
lung machine and this is done by means of special plastic cannulae			
This tube attached from the right side of the heart will			
drain impure blood from the heart to the heart lung machine 			
The blood will be purified in the heart lung machine and			
will then be returned to the heart by means of another tube attached			
to the aorta background noise 			
This then completes the circuit which diverts the blood 			
from the heart to the heart lung machine and then returns it to the			
patient 			
Thereby bypassing the heart and lungs 			
During this time the heart can be made to stop and the			
main operation performed 			
The connections between the tubings and the heart must			
not only be watertight but must also be secure to prevent any			
accidental blow out during the operation 			
Also care must be taken to prevent any air bubbles			
from entering the circulation 			
And the heart lung machine is started 			
Blood will be pumped into the body and the patient's 			
own heart will slow down and will stop injecting 			
The saphenous vein is then distended and checked for any leaks 			
and prepared for the anastomosis 			
For this the heart must be completly stopped and so 			
the blood supply to the heart is cut out by planting the aorta 			
The cordioplagic solution is injected into the heart an			
ice cold saline is poured on its surface to lower its temperature			
This protects the heart during the period that is blood			
supply is entirely cut off 			
The selected artery is then cut beyond the block and			
this probe shows that one end of the artery is completely obstructed			
The grafting procedure starts by attaching one end of this			
saphenous vein to this cut in the artery 			
This anastomosis is performed with a very fine 			
polypropelene suture 			
A high degree of precision is required at this stage 			
For this anastomosis must not only be watertight but			
must be absolutely smooth so that the blood flow from the vein to			
the artery is absolutely unhindered cough 			
While all this is being done the heart lies completly			
still protected by its lowered temperature as well as the			
effects of the cardioplagic solution that has been injected into it			
 surgeons at work: visuals 			
Once this end of the anastomosis is completed the completion			
of the graft requires that the other end of the graft be connected to			
the aorta 			
But this does not require a stand still heart and so 			
the heart at this stage can be made to beat again after its blood			
supply has been restored 			
The other end of the saphenous vein is now prepared 			
This end has to be connected to the aorta 			
And for this a portion of this bl 			
blood vessel is isolated in a special form 			
An opening is made in this isolated portion of the aorta 			
And to this opening the other end of the saphenous vein is			
carefully sewn sewing the vein 			
This again is performed with a very fine polypropelene suture			
The completed graft now fills with blood and supplies			
blood to the portion of the heart which was earlier deprived of blood			
supply 			
The oxygenator is the centre piece of the heart lung machine			
 and performs the vital function of purifying the impure blood			
that it receives from the body 			
It oxygenates the blood and removes carbon dioxide 			
Advances in modern medicine have made coronary artery			
bypass surgery not only a safe procedure but also accessible to			
the common man 			
The same sequence of events continues and the second and			
the third graft are placed in succession 			
Thereby bypassing all three blocked vessels 			
The completion of the procedure the heart beats vigorously			
 and is now ready to be disconnected from the heart lung machine 			
The connecting tubes are then removed one by one 			
disconnecting tubes in machine 			
All the openings in the heart are carefully stitched and			
a final check is made to look for any bleeding points at the side			
 of the anastomosis 			
The major operation over the chest can now be closed 			
The divided breast bone is approximated with stout			
sutures and the subcutaneous tissue and the overlying skin are			
stitched together in layers 			
The graft at the end of the operation the patient will be			
revived from anaesthesia and shifted to the intensive care unit			
 for recovery 			
May it please Your Honour 			
Now this is a case in which originally there were five			
accused persons 			
There were five accused persons 			
And the police was able to get the presence of only three			
persons they could arrest three persons 			
So we have started with the case against these three accused			
 two have clarified right from beginning interruption they			
are not there no one of them 			
Thereafter Your Honour was pleased to frame a charge against			
them on two accounts the charges execute them 			
interruption 			
Against three persons interruption 			
Three accounts interruption 			
Which is that charge number sir ? interruption 			
That is there that I'll I'll I will be giving up that			
charge Sir thirty seventh read is Bombay Police Act for that			
purpose I have not laid the evidence sir 			
Because in order to prove the charge under Bombay Police Act 			
it is necessary for the prosecution to show that the promolgation			
 order was duly exhibited and it was promulgated in			
various parts and not only that but there was it was specially also			
there interruption yes yes the Bandra police station then I have			
to examine the constable I have to examine the police officer I have			
to produce the diary entries showing all those things which has not			
been done in this particular case 			
Therefore as it has cou code 			
number three two words Your Honour can take it that the			
prosecution has not laid any evidence on that account 			
Therefore now the first charge is that your accused number one			
two three along with absconding accused Motu Mota			
Umesh and Kadam on or about the third day of April			
nineteen eighty-eight at about eleven ten hours in presence of			
the common intention at open place near Harbour railway line 			
 shun shunting track Pragati nagar 			
Matunga Dharavi Bombay at nine committed murder by intentionally			
 and all knowingly causing the death of Iyengar 			
Silkrumal Pandu and thereby committed an offence punishable under			
section three naught two read with section thirty-four of the Indian			
Penal Code and within the cognizance of this court 			
Now second this is one charge of murder 			
Murder in respect of Iyengar 			
Second charge is under section three nought seven Sir 			
That charge is that you accused number one two three 			
along with the absconding accused Umesh and Kadam 			
on about third April on the same day at about eleven thirty-five in			
presence of common intention did an act of causing with			
 Rampuri knife and koyta causing heart			
attack near Government Milk booth opposite Madrasis Masjid Dr			
Ambedkar road Matunga Bombay with such intent interruption 			
ahn with such intention and under such circumstances that if by			
that act you had caused the death of Kadu Hosappa			
Achari Kadu Hosappa Achari you would have been guilty			
of murder but the Kadu he is survived and therefore 			
and that you caused the hurt to the two words and thereby			
committed an offence punishable under section three nought seven of the			
Indian Penal Code with read with section thirty-four of the Indian Penal			
code and within the cognizance of Your Honours court Sir 			
Now therefore there are two charges one charge 			
interruption yes interruption because I have not laid any 			
interruption in entire view 			
No evidence has been laid 			
Therefore as we got third cause Prosecution itself is that			
they have not proved the third charge because no evidence was there on			
the third charge Sir 			
Now Your Honour as far as the background of this case is			
concerned actual interruption actually we started			
recording the evidence on fourteenth October ninety-two 			
Prior to that this case went from various courts to various			
courts and thereafter ultimately it came to this court Sir 			
Till then the accused prevent at the Trial Court from			
commencing the trial Sir interruption did not allowed 			
interruption 			
They made all efforts to see that the accused that the			
advocates are made to run away 			
They would say that we don't want these advocates we don't want			
that advocates and ultimately even the court also cancelled those			
prosecutors they made allegations against the court also 			
All types of allegations were made and subsequently the case			
has come to this court 			
Moment the case came to our court we we immediately framed			
the charge and started with an assertion proceeded from day to day			
 right upto eighteen December 			
On eighteen December ninety-two I closed my case 			
Thereafter it was expected that immediately Your Honour will			
 take upto thirtieth 			
That Your Honour has done 			
And after two words judgement of the accused it			
was expected that I should start with the argument and the defence			
should do immediately commence with their arguments 			
Unfortunately Mr Seth the Defence Advocate on behalf of			
number two and three went out of Bombay making a promise to this court			
 that he is going to give a written argument or if he is not			
 then he will come and argue himself and at the most it will take			
another two or three months so Your Honour was to give then didn't 			
interruption by March interruption 			
And he said that but he promised that even prior to that			
 he would send the written argument so the interruption 			
 haan they have got this to say 			
But nothing of this kind kind was done 			
 It's only about couple of weeks that only two or			
three weeks back that he happened to be here in Bombay and that is			
how we have fixed up this particular date for argue 			
Therefore lot of delay has been caused in recording the			
evidence and the arguments because we started with the 			
recording of the evidence on fourteenth October and on now on fifteenth			
September I'm arguing the matter 			
Therefore I'm sorry that I will have to take Your Honour			
through the evidence of each witness because nobody is expected it is			
not expected the court to remember what evidence was laid one			
year back practically one year back 			
So I will have to go through each and every witness read			
the evidence and thus start commenting on it 			
So I will start with the first witness P W one Sir 			
interruption 			
In all in all in this particular case are examine 			
twenty-four Prosecution interruption witnesses 			
To divide this into two separate compartments because some			
of the witnesses will be in respect of murder some will be in respect of			
the second charge interruption and some witnesses will be common			
witnesses namely when both both the accused both the persons			
were taken to hospital the same constable there he made diary entries			
etcetera 			
So there would be some common witnesses Sir 			
Then regarding scene of offence and all these thing some common			
witnesses will be there 			
So now we'll I'll start reading P W one Sir so			
that will give the list of F I R 			
If Your Honour wants this facts I'll give the this facts			
Sir interruption 			
Now this has not been done in chronological order 			
We have not examined the witnesses in a chronological order 			
Therefore some witnesses are pertaining to first charge			
immediately some pertaining to second charge 			
So whichever witness was available those witnesses were			
brought by the officers because the accused as I have said 			
in the beginning when I open up the case I said that these accused			
are notorious type kind of notorious character bad character 			
accused 			
And witnesses were afraid of coming 			
So the police officer Mr Ansari and other officers they had to			
take lot of pains to go and collect them search them and then			
get them here in the court 			
So it which ever is available I started examining 			
So normally otherwise what happens normally our practice			
is a a all prosecutors that 			
when we find that there is charge of murder then we start examining all			
the witnesses regarding that particular charge in a chronological order			
 then three nought seven same order and then some common things			
 Doctors etcetera they are all common thing which are there 			
But in this case unfortunately for the prosecution it was not			
possible because victims were afraid they were running away and			
the officer has to go get them locate them and then they			
were brought here interruption 			
Yes because they were afraid running away means they were			
they made themslves scared to the police officer 			
The moment they found that some officer from Dharavi police			
station interruption 			
The people are interested but unfortunately for the prosecution 			
two accused are were abscounding and they are still abscounding 			
and and those accu accused persons			
has a gang and this gang was moving in that area with the use of this			
 tho constant fear in the minds of witnesses that these two			
other persons may not directly but through some other persons may			
attack them and therefore they were not willing to come interruption			
These interruption of course this gang consisted of			
this main five persons out of which two are now ab ab 			
 absconding interruption ah yes 			
And apart from those those two persons again formed another			
gang because these three persons were not there they formed another gang			
 but then they were not directly coming in Dharavi area they were			
sending those persons in Dharavi area because they knew the moment they			
come to Dharavi area these officers from Dharavi Police Station Ansari			
 and other other Jadhav they will definitely arrest them because			
they would arrest them 			
Therefore they would not come personally 			
They would send their other gundas there in that			
locality to settle everything interruption 			
And therefore this is the this therefore when I read the			
evidence some of the witnesses will be for first account some of the			
witnesses of second account 			
So I will then up subsequently while concluding the			
argument cough I will see that all those witnesses are I will			
 some arrange and then I will say that I will point out the			
exact interruption haan 			
Then I will say therefore in this case this is the scene			
regarding this this witness is regarding this 			
That we can register afterwards 			
So therefore I will now start with the P W one cough 			
Now the important point in this particular case is that			
this incident that taken place on the on the on Sunday 			
It was on Sunday third October 			
 I'm sorry third April sir was Sunday 			
interruption no third sir 			
It was third April nineteen eighty-eight interruption			
 haan nineteen eighty-eight 			
It was Sunday and it was in the morning at about eleven ten 			
Eleven ten or so morning time interruption 			
At an open place near Harbour railway line shunting track			
 that was the interruption 			
So I am I am talking about the first offence of murder 			
interruption 			
So now was of the interruption Masjid Masjid 			
So now what I am giving is the first offence of murder took			
place first 			
So therefore I am giving this place interruption 			
At open place near Harbour railway line 			
interruption Matunga 			
Harbour railway line shunting track 			
This track which was not operated except for shunting purposes			
 Pragati Nagar hutment at Matunga Sir One word 			
but interruption Dharavi sir interruption no it comes			
in Dharavi sir 			
And now as it has this is the incident regarding murder of			
 Iyengar and now I'm giving the timing of the 			
other persons 			
That is uh Kaju Kadu 			
 Hosappa Achari regarding three naught seven there the			
timing is about eleven thirty interruption 			
No because we have started with the evid I am why I am			
 tak talking about this because the P			
W one is Kadu Achari when I read the evidence I'll 			
be reading the the evidence of Kadu Achari 			
Therefore I'm giving the timing Sir 			
 Kadu Hosappa Achari interruption because we			
started with the evidence of Kadu Achari P W therefore 			
I'm giving this first these particular timing sir 			
So this incidence took place at the Masjid Dr			
Ambedkar Raod opposite some Madras Maderesa Maderesa 			
 Ka Kazi Masjid Ambedkar road Matunga			
And this took place at about eleven thirty sir 			
Now there is a connection between this murder and that murder			
in the sense that Iyengar happened to be the 			
brother-in-law of Achari 			
 Iyengar who was dead was murdered was the			
brother-in-law of the witness Achari interruption 			
He is husband of his sister 			
I will tell Your Honour why I examined this Achari 			
person 			
As in the session Ex Ex Ex is concerned against			
the accused number one 			
The Prosecution has miserably failed to establish the charge			
P W one Kadu Achari in his uh evidence says			
 that I picked up a stone which was which which hit			
the rear side of the accused shoulder and the accused sat down 			
This statement this very version of the evidence has been			
contradicted repeatedly not twice but repeatedly by P W three and			
P W one himself 			
According to the P W one he picked up one stone and that			
hit that one word 			
According to P W three the P W one has picked up two stones 			
This is the contradiction 			
Now the P W one P W three says the accused number			
one was at distance of at about twenty feet 			
Yes 			
And above all Your Honour P W one himself does not say			
 that he was assaulted by N H S 			
Your Honour will see page number five paga page number five 			
 interruption 			
Yes Your Honour I'm coming to the cross examination 			
Before cross examination I'm coming to the cross			
examination 			
Before cross examination let us see what the P W one has			
said 			
He had stated in examination you see			
 interruption 			
Sir here are the contradiction which I want to point out 			
In this examination you see at page number six P W one			
says I picked up a stone and threw it at that N H S			
 which hit him on the rear on the rear side of his left shoulder			
Thereafter all of these five assailants surrounded me and 			
assault started assaulting me 			
He does not say the effect of throwing and hitting with a			
stone 			
He does not say anything that the accused sat down 			
He says all the accused surrounded me and started			
assaulting me 			
 interruption 			
No no what he says against 			
 interruption 			
No I have to I am pointing out from the P W one himself 			
that he does not say as the latter said he does not say that N H S			
 has assaulted me 			
 interruption 			
No no contradiction not in that sense I'm talking 			
Contradiction so far as his sta his own statement is			
concerned uh his own evidence is concerned 			
Contradiction not between the statement and the evidence 			
 interruption 			
There were inconsistency between the e between			
the evidence of P W three and the examination in D 			
I realized in the cross examination 			
Now here he says I picked up a stone I threw			
it it hit the rear side of sh of shoulder			
 of the N H S 			
He does not say that he sat down 			
He says then all of them surrounded me and started			
assaulting me 			
Now Your Honour Your Honour thereafter P W one 			
further goes on saying they surrounded me 			
They started assaulting me 			
How how ?			
 Mota Umesh assaulted me with sickle on my			
left forearm Big Umesh assaulted me with by sickle on my			
right wait wait 			
 Big Umesh assaulted me on the right thigh 			
He does not say N 			
 interruption 			
No no no 			
 interruption 			
Your Honour I'm not on that angle I'm not			
on that angle 			
 interruption 			
He says interruption 			
No Sir what he says that he was assaulted by C D E and F 			
He does not say he was assaulted by N H S 			
He says he was assaulted by Mr C with this 			
weap this weapon sickle D by sickle			
again D by this weapon and E by last E by			
 nothing no weapon is there 			
So he does not implicate N H S accused number one 			
that he assaulted him 			
Page number six Your Honour top P W three at page number			
forty-six says that accused number one told the other assailants			
 to assault him 			
Page number forty-six Your Honour 			
Yes yes 			
So Yo interruption 			
No Your Honour interruption I'm coming to that			
Your Honour 			
Here I wanted to draw your attention on this this piece			
piece of evidence that he has not implicated the N H S so far as			
any weapon is concerned with which he was assaulted interruption 			
This Achari's statement interruption 			
The three nought one coming to that 			
So far as this interruption 			
Three nought seven also interruption 			
Sir interruption 			
Thirty-four interruption Common intention 			
interruption 			
Sir therefore Your Honour the common intention is to be proved			
 uh I'm coming to that also 			
First of all charge under section three hundred 			
interruption 			
Not I want to prove the insistent inconsistency with the piece			
of evidences 			
Now here interruption uh at page Your Honour at page			
number four he says that accused number 			
Page number five Your Honour Sir P W one says N H S 			
was armed with button knife 			
Sir we had interruption 			
Where Your Honour interruption 			
Where Your Honour this is there is a lot of inconsistency with			
 in the evidence of the same person 			
Your Honour once approved that the case which is defective			
because of the infirmity of the evidence 			
No then there is no point question of common intention Your Honour			
 interruption 			
Here Your Honour he says that all the accused assaulted me there he			
says that I was having the butto he was having the button knife			
 and what he has stated before P W seven came that M G R was			
having sickle 			
P W three says N H S was having sickle 			
Nobody says button knife interruption 			
No I'm connect see I'm read it jointly 			
connect jointly connect 			
So that uh any uh any formal statement can be made			
before the court interruption 			
So Your Honour my submission is my submission is Your Honour			
 that the particular witness P W one has not stated any			
previous evidence that he was assaulted by P W uh			
He was assaulted by accused number one with any weapon 			
interruption 			
No Your Honour Your Honour has corrected my word can't I			
instead of contradiction inconsistent 			
Yes Your Honour 			
Aa at page number thirty-four Your Honour what P W three says			
about the stone 			
Your Honour if if that is so Your Honour then nothing			
remains 			
If the stone is hit to the accused then accused sat down			
 interruption 			
I am a interruption 			
I am on the point there once that interruption P			
W one sustained injury he sat down if he sat down 			
And if he sustained injury he cannot be expected to act 			
actually to assault the accused num of P W one is the			
means it's this acc aa accused 			
 number one would have suspect is accused number one would have been			
 hit with that stone 			
And his commission was that he sat down accused number			
one according to the evidence of P W three P W one that he			
sat down and thereafter Your Honour he cannot be expected to act			
actually to assault someone to that extent 			
He could not bear even a stone 			
That was his health 			
So Your Honour Your Honour presuming the two days later as 			
interruption and sat down thereafter 			
Thereafter what happened ?			
Thereafter they went away interruption 			
Your Honour according to P W three thereafter accused			
number one respected accused was rest of the accused			
 according to P W three were assault 			
That means accused number one did not assault at all 			
Para twenty Your Honour page number forty 			
Your Honour not only that he was simply hurt he shouted 			
In a expec interruption page number forty para			
twenty one 			
Page forty interruption 			
Here N H S was armed with sickle interruption			
 			
Yes he is talking about deceased 			
He is talking about deceased Iyengar 			
I am talking about Kadu Achari interruption 			
I am coming to that a afterwards finishing the			
charge so far as Kadu Achari is concerned interruption 			
Yes uh I I was interruption 			
Yes he says here and thereafter she says I			
 I do not know what weapons who was having 			
She says that she doesn't know which accused was having 			
which weapon interruption 			
No mainly on the benefit of doubt it is not over yes which			
which arm interruption no no assault assault with what ?			
 interruption 			
The same witness interruption number P W three			
herself says at page number forty-five P W three says I cannot			
say as to who was armed with which weapon 			
When she cannot even see the weapon with which her own husband was			
assaulted in in her before her own eyes 			
She cannot see all she cannot interruption she cannot			
exactly say who has assaulted interruption 			
She cannot exactly say who has assaulted 			
Just merely taking somebody's name interruption 			
Sir blood mark on the knife though before before the			
court when you had pointed out the knife 			
He says there's there's no blood mark on the			
knife interruption 			
It was it was sealed in the wrapper interruption 			
It was sealed labelled interruption 			
If if if at all the blood was there it should be there 			
interruption 			
No no it is it is very risky to leave this type of evidence			
Your Honour when she says at page number forty-five I cannot say who			
was having what type of weapon interruption 			
Then uh it will be very hardship if the portion of the			
evidence which goes in favour of the Prosecution is to be selected 			
and the evidence the fortune of which something might even 			
interruption 			
Yes there are contradictions Your Honour 			
Here I will point out the Supreme Court judgement whenever			
there are two versions one goes in favour of the accused one goes in			
 fav against the accused			
The version which goes in favour of the accused or any version			
chosen by the accused interruption 			
No no here interruption 			
They have what interruption 			
Yes Your Honour at page forty-five she says I cannot say			
 what type of weapon who was having interruption 			
Why should I put that he he was having this weapon 			
interruption 			
Sir how can I suggest that I was having weapon I was not			
having knife I was having sickle can I suggest him interruption			
Yes Your Honour interruption 			
At last line paragraph thirty-six she says I cannot say			
as to interruption 			
Cross examination interruption 			
Forty-six last line I cannot say as to who was			
armed with which weapon 			
So that both the witnesses P W three and P W one			
 I have not established any particular weapon which I was having 			
either sickle or a a knife			
Therefore the assumption is that I was not having any weapon			
either sickle or knife 			
At page number thirty-four Your Honour the P W three says			
 N H S and Asami told to kill my husband			
 			
Here here also Your Honour told 			
So Your Honour may say that there are having common intention			
 Your Honour here also the N H S is inactive 			
He does not inactive 			
 He doe he does not act 			
positively by assaulting 			
After hitting with the stone interruption regarding			
common intention 			
Now Your Honour interruption no interruption 			
What I interruption 			
What I am trying to convince the court there's a			
different interruption 			
No there are different versions 			
Your Honour give me one minutes time 			
Your Honour so far as so far as uh I have come to			
know that Your Honour was lecturer also yo 			
Your Honour was a lecturer also Your Honour knows law better			
than I understand 			
In fact uh Sir I am making my own submission 			
Thereafter I will stop my argument 			
Mr Sheikh will argue and he will cover my client also 			
One submission Your Honour regarding Ramna 			
 Ramna Raman Raman Ramna who was a very well			
 who present who was present at the time of this challa			
 game 			
His statement was recorded by the police interruption			
What recorded by the police interruption 			
He was not called as a witness in the box interruption			
 			
Therefore Your Honour adverse inference made pleasing			
 taken 			
Even if if the Ramna would have been called in the			
state 			
If Ramna would have been called as a witness 			
interruption 			
If the Ramna would have been called interruption			
If he would have been called definitely Your Honour for			
certain reasons we have not called the Ramna 			
Your Honour I am citing in judgement therefore I am making my			
submission 			
If the Ramna would have been called he would have			
 damaged the case of the Prosecution

give you the pages whenever it is necessary 			
My my line of argument will be Sir that I'll be			
 dealing with a case against me 			
I have divided that according to my learned friend the case in			
two parts 			
One is scene two and one scene seven 			
Same uh witnesses 			
I have uh I have divided 			
Now Sir according to I need not tell Your Honour Your			
Honour is well aware Your Honour is uh has read the evidence			
and well aware of the the prosecution interruption 			
Yes Sir I will be I will be giving a written statement argument also			
 interruption 			
Yes Sir I'll be putting interruption 			
Yes Sir interruption 			
No no Sir e e interruption no no it is ready Sir			
It is in my interruption 			
Size Sir it wil be Sir I interruption 			
No no Sir your 			
My handwriting uh my my my handwriting is very clear Sir 			
Alright Sir I'll I'll get it typed

Doesn't matter Sir I'll get it interruption 			
 I'll argue orally orally also 			
On the same point interruption 			
Your Honour may at present Your Honour may not take 			
interruption 			
Yes Yes Sir at present Your Honour may not take when I 			
when I am commenting on his argument from the note then Your			
Honour will take 			
Because at present I am arguing from my own note which 			
I'm going to present to Your Honour Yes interruption 			
Now Sir as as my learned friend has put it for three hundred			
and two four wi eye witnesses are there Sir 			
The first eye witness is Santosh Iyengar Pandu			
 who is the son of deceased 			
And the the rest three are there Sir 			
The second is Arif Jauhar 			
Third is Kadu Timothy and fourth is Nasreem			
 Shafi 			
These are the four persons			
Now I'll I will take one by one 			
 I'll take uh uh P W seven Santosh 			
son of the deceased Iyengar Sir 			
My submission is Sir that this witness is out to help the			
Prosecution being the blood relation of uh Iyengar 			
as well as Kadu Achari 			
So as his sister's son interruption 			
These are interested witness Sir interruption 			
But Sir unfortunately unfortunately yes Sir 			
I I I'm not I am interruption yes Sir 			
interruption 			
Yes Sir 			
I I'm not saying I I I am I am alluding Sir few			
things I will have to admit Sir 			
One one of these is the one the the uh Iyengar 			
has been assaulted and his death has been caused 			
We don't dispute that 			
There is also no dispute interruption 			
Who assaulted			
Who assaulted yes interruption 			
 Haan accused number six one part accused number			
 interruption 			
Yes Sir			
So wha interruption 			
Yes Sir what and we have taken and whether whether			
these witnesses who have who have come here and deposed are 			
trustworthy witnesses in favour of accused number against 			
accused number two and three 			
This is way I'm I'm going to start 			
Now the first thing is Sir why he insisted witness 			
Because Sir they all are uh being close rela uh it is			
on their evidence that this uh Santosh and his mother			
 after Iyengar was removed to the hospital they also			
followed and went to the hospital 			
So in that case Santosh was in the hospital on			
three four eighty-eight Sir 			
As my learned friend has pointed out that officer were very alert			
enough they have examined the eye witnesses on that same day 			
But Your Honour will see Sir that the evidence of this			
P W seven has not been re recorded 			
 on on three four though he was available and present in hospital			
Sir interruption 			
 Santosh though he was present and available to			
them in hospital and they were very alert enough to examine all the			
eye witnesses on the same day if not if uh in the hospital Sir 			
 in in in in the in the police station but same			
day 			
I am talking of the same day 			
But though Your Honour will assign that the statement of 			
Santosh has been recorded on four four eighty-eight next day Sir 			
Why why this this uh has been postponed Sir 			
My submission is Sir interruption 			
Time is not given 			
On on I have seen that the original time is not not			
mentioned Sir 			
But date is date is four four interruption 			
 santosh Sir in Marathi 			
The date is four four eighty-eight 			
Time not mentioned Sir 			
I sent to the return services there Sir but I have seen it and			
uh I didn't find it 			
Yes Sir 			
Anyway Sir 			
Now why this why this delay of one day Sir interruption 			
My submission is Sir that the officers when they			
recorded the statement of eye witnesses specially this Arif			
 Kadu and such interruption when they recorded			
the statement of these P W Arif Jauhar Kadu Timothy and			
 Nasreen 			
In their statements they were not they had not emphatically			
 said about the assault on seven two and three on 			
Iyengar 			
Their names were not given 			
Therefore they wanted somebody to give the names			
of these two assailants 			
Further these these two assai 			
assailants there according to the prosecution 			
They were known to Kadu uh Achari and P W			
three Kadamma 			
Because they have seen them in that labour camp locality			
 and they were knowing the names and therefore they want to put			
 put these names of names of number two and three in the in the mouth			
 of P W seven and therefore this delay of one day Sir 			
And therefore my submission is Sir that he he is a witness 			
who being a blood relation is one thing he is out to uh uh say that this			
uh both these persons and another thing is is that he is under the			
thumb of the these these two police to say what they want to say 			
I specially name number two and three 			
And therefore this delay as I I have already told 			
Yes beg your pardon Sir interruption 			
So he has he has named it three persons only Sir 			
Because Sir they wanted to in involve			
 these persons and therefore uh his uh statement has			
been delayed interruption 			
Yes Sir recorder is underneath 			
Now Sir let us see the e ev evidence			
 on record Sir 			
What type of evidence on record has been recorded Sir 			
Now he has he has stated Sir that the Big Umesh 			
assaulted my father by knife I do not recollect on which uh Sir			
it is uh page page seventy-five line eighteen to twenty Your Honour			
 interruption 			
Seventy-five Sir 			
Ha Big Umesh assaulted my father with knife			
 I do not recollect on which portion of the body of my father 			
was assaulted by Big Umesh 			
So I 			
Now Sir if if he if he has seen the assault then he should			
tell Sir on which part 			
As Sir Your Honour will will see Sir here he has given 			
that accused number one assaulted Iy 			
 Iyengar on chest stomach chest hands and			
legs 			
So he'd he'd given given definite part 			
In his case if he had really seen it Sir my submission is Sir			
that he he he should have given the part			
But he does not give Sir			
He said I don't recollect 			
But recollection I mean uh that that can't be any reason 			
for whether whether he has seen it or not seen it that is these are			
the only two que questions we can we			
have to answer Sir 			
Now this this also Sir uh uh is an imp 			
 improvement and uh omission has been proved uh in the			
 in in the statement uh Your Honour I will tell one minute 			
It is one ninety-seven Sir 			
One ninety-seven 			
Page one ninety-seven Your Honour 			
No I'm sorry sorry is this this uh contradiction is not			
proved 			
This contradiction was not proved 			
 I'm sorry 			
Then Sir further up uh at page seventy-five only Sir line			
twenty twenty to twenty-two Sir 			
He says Sir 			
 Even my father was crying for help nobody from			
 from the neighbour aaa neighbouring area came forward to help			
 as N H uh N H S and his associates were threatening 			
the uh members of the public by saying that that they will kill them			
 they will kill them 			
This implement is is proved but yet I'm sorry Sir 			
At page one ninety-seven line three Sir from below			
One ninety-seven line three from below Sir 			
Uh uh P W seven did not disclose be be 			
before me that when when his statement was recorded that			
accused num uh that and that uh that the two			
absconding accused threaten the members of the pu 			
 public while interruption 			
Public that's all interruption 			
 Haan by that time Sir 			
Because it is not mentioned there interruption 			
Yes Sir 			
Sir this this contradiction has been has been proved 			
That he has not said stated so 			
Sir this this is this is definitely a improvement a			
before this honourable court Sir interruption 			
Yes Sir 			
Then further Sir 			
I I narrated the the incident to them 			
This is this is at uh page seventy-six Your Honour 			
I narrated the incident to the to them that my father was			
assaulted 			
However I did not utter the names of the assailants 			
Now Sir if he has not given the names of the assailants			
 then immediately after the assault he goes to the mother and and			
tells this I mean part uh uh tells this information 			
So he has seen the incident			
If he had seen the incident he could have given the names 			
My submission is Sir that time if he has not given the			
names that means either he has not seen them Sir or he has seen some			
persons whose names he did not know 			
This this this can be only two possibilities 			
Then Sir page seventy-eight line eighteen to			
nineteen eighteen and nineteen Your Honour interruption 			
Yes Your Hon uh lines were drawn on the ground by			
chalk 			
Yes yes Sir interruption 			
Yes 			
So and now Your Honour will see will see Sir that all other			
witnesses specially Ka Kadu 			
 P W nine Sir Because he is the person who has who has			
produced that Challa game board 			
It was cardboard 			
Everybody says that it was a cardboard and uh specially this			
 Kadu he has produced that cardboard 			
And therefore Sir this man when this man says Sir that			
knife is gone on the on on the ground and then in the square 			
That means this also shows Sir that he has not Sir he was			
not present at the at the scene of offence 			
Because what is the fact he does not know Sir 			
Now about Kadu Timothy Sir he has he has stated before			
 the this honourable court Sir 			
For playing the game the the that is at ninety-seven line			
seven eleven seven to eleven Sir in the in the statement of Kadu			
 Sir 			
 For playing the game of Challa eight			
 kaudis small stones and cardboard are are required			
The above mat uh above mentioned material which are			
required for playing the game were produced by me 			
He has stated 			
So actually it was a cardboard when this request			
states that lines were drawn on the ground			
That means he has not seen the 			
He was not at the scene of offence Sir 			
Then further up Sir 			
Then I come to the the the uh another eye witness P W eight Sir			
 Ar Arif Jauhar 			
He is a ra ra ra radiator 			
mechanic ra ready to repairer Sir 			
He admits that he does not have any re 			
regular training in radiator repairing 			
He only learnt from his brother who is a who is a radiator			
mechanic 			
He is carrying on his business on pavement at Karnaik Bandar			
Sir			
That is there in the evidence Sir 			
He he does not he he does not possess any licence for his			
 business			
That is at page eigh eighty-nine 			
 Your Honour 			
Now Sir if a person is carrying a business that too			
on on the path pavement then he must he must have at least a some			
some place to carry on business because it it can't be carried out on on			
just on the road Sir 			
This is the in make making uh radiator radiator repairy			
If he if he has got a shop or a place then he must have a licence			
for that			
He doesn't possess anything any document 			
He has stated Sir I will just point out interruption 			
He said I was he was carrying on the business on on he was			
carrying on the business on pavement interruption pavement 			
Sir pavement also doesn't doesn't mean that he shouldn't have any			
licence Sir interruption 			
He says carrying on the business Sir carrying on the bus 			
any business Sir anywhere that is licence is required 			
Licence is required B M C licence is required interruption			
Offence 			
Oh yes Sir			
 po po po policeman charged him			
 for not not not carrying the interruption 			
Without licence interruption 			
On didn't say Sir 			
So therefo therefore Sir this			
man doesn't produce any evidence to show that he has he is carrying 			
interruption 			
He is carrying on the business 			
Yes 			
He doesn't possess any document 			
Therefore whether really he is carrying on such a business is			
not proved Sir 			
Now Sir another thing about this witness I I wa			
 I want to say Sir that he hasn't got any any uh			
uh regard for the truth Sir because he changes the mat 			
version in just in a second or or sentence for 			
For that I'll I'll point I'll take Your			
Honour 			
He yes uh at page eighty-three Your Honour uh at uh line			
nineteen and twenty-two Sir 			
 Iyengar was was also assaulted by three more 			
per associates of N H S 			
He said this 			
Then Sir interruption 			
Of N H uh N H S interruption 			
Now I said that then in the next he said now I say that			
two other re remaining associates of 			
N H S a a a also assaulted Iyengar 			
So he make changes in this Sir interruption 			
Yes Sir			
Then then oh if he has he has seen a certain incident 			
then there is no necessity to change Sir 			
I understand Sir why it is changed I'll I'll 			
 I'll tell Your Honour 			
Because Sir he must have got some some help or some uh			
audience and note carefully Sir who just that you have you have			
 doing something wrong 			
So they must have put extra fingers instead of three 			
So he said two persons 			
Why why he why he doesn't say in the same second line only 			
interruption 			
That is my argument			
He is you take it or or leave it interruption 			
Then Sir a question was put to him Sir that the			
version na narrated by me in in			
yesterday day it doesn't effect that after after gateman refused to			
open the gate gate			
This is at page uh ninety-three Your Honour 			
The version narrated by me in yesterday's evidence 			
to the effect that after gateman refused to open the gate I'd			
 got down from the motor taxi and went to the shop of 			
Yogendra 			
He is haan Yogendra 			
He is incorrect 			
He is not correct 			
So he admits Sir what he has stated yesterday was was not			
correct 			
Therefore I want I am just pointing out Sir uh what regard he			
has for the truth truth Sir			
He himself admits that yesterday the uh whatever I stated was			
not correct 			
So my submission is Sir that evidence of such a man Sir who			
hasn't got any any regard for the truth should be taken with uh with			
pinch of 			
Yes Sir 			
Then Sir the about the inj about injuries to 			
 Kadu Achari Sir P W one 			
Point is Sir about the injuries he has mentioned 			
interruption

He has invited the attention of this court to page twenty para two			
 wherein uh this witness has stated that deceased was assaulted on			
 his rear right shoulder 			
However this witness has subsequently stated that the that 			
she does not uh recollect on which portion of the uh back deceased			
sustained injury 			
He has further canvassed that the deceased had deceased uh 			
told her that Yakub that he is the accused present before the			
court assaulted him 			
The learned special P P has invited the attention of this court to			
para three page twenty in which there is a reference of trace			
 while accused was going to Nagpada police station 			
The accused assaulted the deceased on his right uh side rib 			
Then the dece deceased ran in			
the hotel and took a chair to defend himself 			
P W number six also went ahead to catch hold of the 			
accused			
Thereafter the accused also assaulted her when uh she			
sustained injury to her left fore-arm above the little finger			
P W number four came running and uh caught hold of the			
accused when accused said in Hindi 			
P W number six has stated that along with the dece 			
 deceased herself her daughter and P W number four			
went to J J Hospital where deceased was admitted in the Hospital 			
She was also treated in J J Hospital 			
The learned special P P has also canvassed that to canvass and			
invited the attention of this court to page uh twenty-two para six			
To show why the statement of this witness was not recorded			
immediately 			
According to him P W number six is an important witness 			
She has no motive to falsely implicate the accused			
There was no enmity between uh her and the accused though			
there may be a quarrel between the deceased and the accused			
He has canvassed that she is not a got up witness 			
P W number six has also sustained injury 			
Entries made by the police constable at the hospital shows that P W			
number six was also brought or came to the hospital 			
And she was treated			
According to him it cannot be said that although her			
statement was recorded late therefore it cannot be said that she was			
not present at the Hospital and uh that she was not treated for			
injury 			
The learned special P P has canvassed that it is uh the human			
approach on the part of the I O in not calling uh calling uh 			
on calling or uh insisting on P W number six to say uh to make a			
statement as she was mourning upon the death of her youngest son 			
On the next day of death she may be waiting for the dead body			
The people from the locality must have been collected to pacify			
 and console P W number six 			
P W number six is also a parda nasheen woman			
And in such circumstances she has no time to visit uh police			
station and it was also not proper to visit police station for 			
recording her statement			
Therefore it cannot be stated that P W number six is unreliable			
The learned special P P has further canvas 			
 uh uh canvassed that P W number seven has			
stated that he made entries in the E P R Register in which the names of			
all three witnesses are there			
He has also stated that they were very much present at the J J			
Hospital also 			
These E P R entries are in exhibit twenty-eight collectively 			
and the xeroxed copy is at exhibit twenty-eight A			
He has also identified P W number six before the court 			
The learned special P P has further canvassed that uh P W			
number eight is Doctor Balkrishna krishna Deshpande who performed			
the post-mortem 			
He has given all the injuries on the person of the deceased			
He has stated that in the evidence that injury number three is			
a fatal injury which is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause			
death 			
The learned special P P has invited attention of this court to			
page ten uh page fourty about the evidence of P W number nine uh 			
Jabbunissa Yusuf 			
She has stated that she was uh she has seen injured a she			
had seen injury on the left shoulder of uh the deceased Mashid			
 			
She has uh supported the prosecution			
She has also not identified the accused person			
She has uh seen bleeding injury on the hand of her mother			
P W number ten is Ramesh Ketkar 			
Accordingly to the learned special P P P W number ten is not			
helping the prosecution 			
P W number eleven is also of no use to prosecution like P W			
number ten P W number twelve is Dr Umesh Shelake 			
This witness has been examined by the prosecution in respect of			
the second charge and he has uh supported the prosecution to prove the			
second charge in para two of his evidence 			
P W number thirteen is one word Bissar Khan 			
In para three of his evidence he has stated that accused has			
committed this offence and he has deposed for the charge number two also			
The learned special P P has canvassed that after the incident			
the accused was not traceable 			
He was arrested at Ahmednagar 			
Sir in this matter the prosecution has examined 			
prosecution has examined in all five witnesses to prove the charge			
 against the accused who is charged under section three nought two			
 that is for committing the murder of his wife 			
The presecution case in brief is that on eleventh of September			
nineteen ninety-two at about four thirty there was a quarrel			
 between the present accused and his wife 			
The quarrel was on the ground that the accused wanted			
 his wife to assist him in the job of his alleged job of			
pick-pocketing			
Joint venture			
Joint venture 			
And since she refused to do do that there was a quarrel			
It has further that she poured kerosene on herself to teach a			
lesson to him and the accused threw a lighted match stick on			
her set her on fire 			
Thereafter the accused goes away from that place and			
this burnt lady is taken to the hospital by one of her			
neighbours 			
There the entire case is on circumstantial evidence in as much			
as there is no direct eye witness in this matter 			
Yes			
The prosecution has relied upon dying declarations 			
namely the first dying declaration made before the special executive			
magistrate that is P W one 			
Yes			
Then the second dying declaration is in the form of			
the F I R which is recorded by the officer and obtained her signature			
Now since she is dead this F I R will become a dying			
declaration 			
And then the third dying declaration which should be oral 			
is alleged to have been made to her mother who had gone 			
immediately to the hospital on being informed about the alleged			
incident 			
 In Marathi 			
The first dying declaration that is which is			
alleged to have been made or have been accorded by the S C M that is			
deposed by P W one who is the S C M himself who has stated that on			
eleven nine ninety-two he recorded the dying declaration in K E M hospital at			
about na eight p m 			
That declaration was made by one Mrs Binaka Bakat who			
is deceased in this particular matter 			
She was in a possession to make her dying declaration 			
He asked a questions and she replied 			
Now if Your Honour takes a look at exhibit five which is the			
dying declaration which is recorded by the S C M P W one it is in form			
of question and answers 			
Written in question an answer form and it bears the thumb			
impression of this deceased 			
It was after it was duly read uh recorded it was read over to			
her and then her thumb impression is obtained 			
Now it would be argued by my learned friend that there is			
no endorsement of the doctor on the uh alleged dying declaration to			
which my submission would be that P W three and P W four 			
specially P W four who is the doctor who had first treated this patient 			
has said that the patient was in a condition to speak 			
That would show that the patient was never unconscious and			
therefore coupled with that			
P W number			
P W number is four is Miss Ram who has 			
treated this patient 			
She she has deposed that the patient was conscious was			
in a condition to speak 			
Then sir if Your Honour sees the cross examination of P W one 			
that is the S C M 			
Sir a question has been asked to him that and he has answered			
 I did not obtain permission in writing from the doctor before			
recording this dying declaration 			
But then no other questions have been asked to this S C M 			
as to why he has not done it or was it his duty to do it 			
Such questions have not been asked or no explanation has been			
sought from the S C M regarding this fact 			
The evidence of			
The evidence of P W four			
Yes yes P W four has also stated P W three has			
also stated and			
P W number three 			
The doctor who has perform the postmortem 			
He has given his opinion that with fifty-six percent superficial			
burns the patient will be in a condition to speak 			
Then			
And if Your Honour sees the evidence of P W four fourth			
line the pa the deceased Binaka Bakat had fifty to			
fifty-five percent burn injuries 			
The patient was in a condition to speak 			
P W four in the examination in chief the fourth line 			
Then the other most important witness to this fact would be 			
P W two who is the mother of the deceased 			
Who was had gone immediately to the			
hospital on receiving the information and the deceased has told			
her told her about the incident 			
Then			
Then sir			
Was patient speaking to P W number two			
Yes yes yes 			
I will come to that evidence 			
But P W one there is no suggestion to the S C M that the			
patient was unconscious 			
There is no suggestion or n no cross examination			
to the effect that the patient was unconscious 			
P W number one and			
To P W number one yes			
She herself told uh			
Told her about the incident and as to how she got burnt			
So there is no suggestion to P W two also 			
Sir as far as P W number two is concerned her evidence is to			
the effect that on eleven nine ninety-two at about four thirty she was in the			
house 			
At that time the accused came to her accused came to her 			
that is P W number two who is the mother of the deceased 			
Accused came to her told her about that her daughter is			
burnt 			
And then and then at that time accused told her that he			
would bring money for medicine 			
And then he does not come back to the hospital 			
That is the conduct of the accused			
He told that P W number two 			
reported about the incident and asked her to bring money no no			
 and			
 He 			
 Two that 			
 No no 			
He said that he would bring money 			
He would bring money 			
 Money to the hospital for medicine			
But he does not come back to the hospital 			
That is the conduct of the accused 			
Yes			
That Your Honour will find on P W number two page 			
Your Honour will find it on the very first page paragraph one uh			
sorry 			
Yes 			
Page the first page of uh P W number two 			
paragraph three 			
Your Honour has got on eleven nine 			
P W number			
Two that is Maibai 			
Yes para			
Para number three on eleven nine ninety-two at about four			
thirty p m I was in my hut 			
At that time accused came to me and informed me that your daughter			
is burnt and he admitted her in a hospital 			
I immediately came to K E M Hospital 			
At that time accused told me that he would bring money for medicine			
He did not return to the hosptal 			
At that time my daughter was in a position to talk 			
Now further 			
Yes			
The next page I asked her as how she sustained burn			
injuries			
She replied Accused was demanding money for uh drinking			
alcohol 			
She req refused to give money			
to him 			
He started beating her and told her to assist him in			
pick-pocket business 			
So that two words 			
Yes so that will show			
Her position she was in a position she had people talk			
Yes 			
Incident two so this is the second dying declaration 			
Again again if Your Honour sees she noticed the burn			
injuries on her part below the chest 			
On page number first page itself on the first page last line			
Earlier page			
Your honour is seeing paragraph three the earlier			
 earlier page earlier page 			
The last line I noticed burn injuries on her part below the chest			
That would show that this part is alright			
There is no burn injuries and doctor are 			
is when I come to that evidence I will point out to Your Honour			
that those burns were superficial 			
They are not those deep burns where the patient would be 			
uh sort of coma or unconscious 			
It is not the case 			
Then this witness has also given the her in her evidence			
 as to how this uh her daughter was burnt 			
She has said that yes she poured kerosene on herself and			
the accused throw lighted match stick 			
There is no improvement if she wanted to improve she would have			
said that the accused threw the kerosene and set herself on fire 			
This is the most natural conduct of this witness of coming before			
the court and deposing the truth 			
The truth which has taken place and whi 			
 which she has heard from the deceased 			
Yes 			
The cross examination is nothing much to the effect to			
distort her evidence and there is no suggestion to her that			
 the her daughter was unconscious 			
Then			
Then sir the next witness is P W three Doctor Ramesh			
 Ba Bane who			
performed the post mortem 			
Yes 			
He says that it was a case of homicided death 			
Page uh paragraph two the very first line 			
Due to burn injuries 			
Then immediately the next line I noticed following			
external in uh in uh injured injuries 			
 on the dead body superficial to deep thermal burns over the uh			
various parts 			
Yes			
Then internal examination fa noticed the			
following injuries 			
Cause of death was due to the complications following fifty-six			
percent superficial to deep thermal burns 			
Then the next next page would be i 			
important that is I notice burn injuries over dead			
body from the chest to abdomen 			
The injuries were fifty-six percent burn injuries nerves ends			
were damaged of the dead body 			
In the given case though the patient sus 			
sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn injuries she will			
be in a position to talk 			
Yeah 			
Then the cross examination 			
Even the patient sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn			
injuries she can survive except if there is no toxamia developed 			
In this case toxamia had developed 			
Both the hands of the deceased were burnt 			
I cannot say both palms of the patient were burnt or not 			
That has been clarified by P W four 			
In this case toxamia had developed 			
Yes 			
Yes			
If no toxamia had developed she would have survived			
Survived			
Yes here he has stated that toxamia has developed 			
Then the next witness is P W four Doctor Maya Ram 			
 who was who's the doctor who			
had first treated this deceased 			
Then			
She has stated as I pointed out the patient was in a			
condition to speak the fourth line 			
Yes			
Then she has proved cer 			
certain case papers of the indoor papers she has fairly stated			
that certain papers should not conversant with the writing or 			
she'll know does not know whose writing it is 			
That portion has been marked X 			
But the portion which she has said or which she had accepted 			
uh it is written by the Registrar and there her signature or initials are			
there 			
So this doctor uh in the cross examination has stated in			
the last line left upper limb had zero percent burn 			
The last line 			
Where ?			
The right uh uh the line above that the right upper limb			
of the patient have five percent burn injuries 			
Sir this was asked with the purpose that the thumb impression			
which is on the F I R the thumb impression which is on the dying			
declaration because of suggestion was put to the S C M that that is not			
then the thumb impression 			
In order to uh support the defence story this question was			
asked which the doctor has opined that there were no burns or zero			
percent 			
Therefore the thu thumb 			
impression is of the deceased 			
It is of her mark the S C M has obtained or the			
Yes yes on the dying declaration			
On the dying declaration			
As well as on the uh F I R 			
Yes 			
Then we come to the evidence of P W five the 			
investigating officer who has recorded the F I R and drawn the scene			
of offence panchanama that is exhibit eight 			
Now Sir he has stated that he was on duty then on			
receiving the telephone message he he had left to K E M Hospital 			
Thereafter he called the S C M that S C M recorded the uh 			
dying declaration and then he himself again recorded her statement which			
he has treated as an F I R where he has obtained the endorsement of			
the Doctor that the patient was in a condition to speak 			
That is exhibit fourteen given by Doctor Khubchandani			
 			
Doctor Khubchandani's e 			
 endorsement has been proved through Doctor Ram P W			
four who's conversant with the uh uh handwriting of Doctor 			
Khubchandani 			
It is endorsed by 			
By P W four whose conversant with the handwriting and			
signature of Doctor Khubchandani and who has stated whereabouts			
of Khubchandani is not known 			
Yes			
Then sir on the F I R the endorsement is after the			
 uh body of the F I R is written thereafter the endorsement is written			
 to which the officer has given an explanation and that explanation is			
on page eleven 			
The Doctor was very much present while the complaint was being			
recorded 			
Since the Doctor was very much present while the complaint was			
being recorded thereaf therefore I			
have not obtained the endorsement of the outside of the complaint but at the			
end of the complaint 			
There is no challenge to that effect by my learned friend that			
 this endorsement has been subsequently obtained to that effect 			
Your honour this is a case where earlier the section was			
applied was three nought seven 			
But later on as the as the deceased as the pa as			
the patient was uh succumbed to death it was altered into			
three nought two IPC Your Honour			
 No 			
Three nought seven to three nought			
Yes three nought two 			
Yes			
Five P W's were examined by the prosecution 			
Five prosecution witnesses were examined by the prosecution 			
But uh there is no eye witness in the whole case unh 			
whole case rested upon the circumstantial evidence and three dying			
declarations 			
As far as Your Your Honour dying declaration by the S C M			
is concerned the the first dying declaration recorded by P W number one			
S C M is concerned there is no any endorsement of the Doctor to			
the effect that the patient was in a fit uh fit there was no			
endorsement that the patient was uh despondent is in a fit state to			
make a declaration 			
Then			
Then as such it wishes it wishes the			
whole dying declaration 			
And then			
Ans as such it wishes it wishes the			
whole dying declaration 			
Because there is no endorsement of the Doctor to the effect 			
that patient was conscious and was in a free state of mind			
What number			
But uh inspite of the fact that uh no endorsement of			
the doctor was obtained in evidence of P W number five on page uh			
Your honour as far as P W number three is concerned he is a			
Doctor who has uh he who has uh performed the post mortem Your Honour			
And what is relevant is at the time of the			
 One word 			
Yes Your Honour it is very much necessary because as far			
as the Doctor's endorsement is concerned Your Honour it is			
relevant because at the time when the declaration was made whether the			
patient or the despondent was in a condition to condition to depose 			
is very much material			
But the Doctor is there 			
 And and and and this this 			
 When the doctor is present before them			
Yes Your Honour			
And uh in this case apart from whether the con patient			
was in a condition to talk is not sufficient what is sufficient is the mental			
act as well Your Honour 			
A patient uh if it is a an incident			
as alleged by the prosecution then a patient can be under the mental			
shock 			
Yes proceed			
And maybe due to one reason or the other his uh 			
reasoning capacity may be affected 			
She may not be able to understand the questions which were put to			
her 			
The 			
Yes			
And uh here Your Honour it is a clear case that uh it			
is she herself it is not the case that I had uh gone and I had read			
the message			
But I fully aware Your Honour that it is a superficial when			
injury everything is there and Your Honour when uh even the I O also			
here says that uh Doctor was very much present 			
Even the evidence of P W number four was also there that he was			
very much present at the time 			
Who ?			
Your honour I am relying upon the evidence of uh P W number			
five upon two 			
Here he has said this since the Doctor was very much present 			
while the complaint was being recorded 			
Your Honour I am on a on the point that when the			
 pa condition of the patient was not serious as alleged by the			
prosecution 			
As far as Your Honour condition uh whether he is in a condition to			
make a statement or not			
That of course			
Honour my honest submission is this that the			
Make it clear 			
P W seven Doctor Ram who has first treated this			
patient immediately after the patient was brought to the hospital has			
deposed in words that she was a con in a condition			
 to speak 			
Your honour my question was that whether at the time of			
admission he was in a condition to talk or not 			
I am not on that point Your Honour			
Doctor Miss Maya 			
Your Honour but I am not on that point Your Honour			
I am not uh challenging the qualification of a Doctor Your			
Honour I am also admitting that she is M S but I am only on the point			
Your Honour whether the time when the deposition was made it 			
Doctor's endorsement was necessary to that effect and because 			
doctor's endorsement is not there Your Honour a reasonable doubt can			
be there Your Honour that he is not uh he may not be in a condition or			
uh or in a mental state to depose what she has deposed 			
Yes 			
See the next point 			
Yes Your Honour 			
My next point is in this incident Your Honour as far as uh 			
kerosene uh prosecution is silent as to from where the complainant			
or I'd say deceased has procured kerosene oil 			
Different versions are before the honourable court 			
According to F I R Your Honour F I R is silent on this point			
As far as Panchanama is concerned exhibit			
eighteen that a plastic bottle was containing kerosene uh kerosene oil			
As far as evidence of P W number three uh two is concerned			
mother of the de deceased but uh 			
Number over six before the judge she has removed the			
Yes it is exhibit 			
Yes Your Honour but as far as the evidence of P W number			
two is concerned Your Honour P W number two says that uh yeah I			
am on page uh two upon two Your Honour that uh in anger she			
poured kerosene on her person from a lamp 			
And uh when I asked the same question in cross examination the			
uh witness says I didn't state in my statement before the police that my			
 daughter Binaka poured kerosene from a lamp on her person 			
witness volunteered the lamp was made of a glass bottle 			
Then what is there 			
That lamp was made of a glass bottle 			
That means she poured herse uh that means the deceased			
had poured kerosene oil uh from the bot uh bot glass			
bottle made uh lamp made of a glass bottle			
Yes 			
And uh if that is so then there is a 			
contrad contradiction between the two that			
whether it is from the plastic bottle that she has poured the kerosene oil or			
from the lamp 			
 As a fact what type of the bottle 			
It is from the lamp or from that plastic bottle			
Exactly Your Honour but as far as the duty of the			
investigation officer is concerned Your Honour it is the duty to find out			
that exactly from where it was procured Your Honour 			
Yes 			
Thirdly Your Honour uh as far as			
Keep the rest free			
Yes Your Honour 			
Thirdly Your Honour I I would uh like to submit that as far as			
the clothes under sealed the article under panchanama 			
is concerned Your Honour I am on that point 			
Over this			
Yes this point is over			
The kerosene is uh			
Yes			
Bottle or a lamp			
So yes Your Honour 			
Article four article four before the court 			
Yes			
Now Your Honour my next point is regarding 			
My next point is regarding the seizure of article			
 What's that 			
Seizure of article			
Article 			
Yes 			
Now Your Honour in this case if we believe the			
prosecution case where there was a burn injury on the chest portion			
 from front			
Chest to abdomen			
Chest to abdomen 			
Then in that case the blouse which was produced by the uh			
under panchanama seized in a seized and produce under			
 panchanama Your Honour that should be in burnt condition			
But here it is in torn condition Your Honour			
Uh now this uh 			
Now Your Honour in this case the only thing which I			
would like to say that now Your Honour as far as uh on			
this point Your Honour only thing I would like to submit that uh in			
forwarding letter in forwarding letter the officer has stated 			
certain queries in that queries Your Honour the first question was			
that whether the exhibit one two three contains any kerosene 			
And clear report to that effect is that on exhibit			
one two and three are positive 			
But no where Your Honour in clear report it is mentioned as a 			
blouse wa blouse was in burnt condition Your Honour 			
Oh			
Yes Your Honour			
And the a few words 			
Yes Your Honour to have a kerosene on the article 			
and and Your Honour when the kerosene is sprinkled on the article uh			
like a blouse or any cloth material Your Honour then there is			
likelihood that uh it will burn Your Honour even it will not be in			
 this position			
Secondly Your Honour I am on the point as far as uh cap 			
 it nowhere the witness or the in F I R neither in the 			
At the scene of			
Dying declaration Your Honour it is stated that it is			
sprinkled Your Honour there is difference between sprinkling and pouring			
Your Honour 			
Here it is poured Your Honour			
But the 			
Yes Your Honour but I am confining myself on the day of			
incident Your Honour 			
As far as on the day of incident is concerned Your Honour			
Yes			
Different version is versions are 			
there in the F I R and in the uh dying declaration Your Honour			
Yes 			
As far as F I R is concerned Your Honour sh			
 she has stated that today that means on eleven			
nine ninety-two at about three pm my husband Mahesh assaulted me			
 as I didn't go to collect scrap and further picked up quarrel with me			
 at about four pm that thing 			
There is a time gap of one hour 			
It means assaulting and between the quarrel 			
That means uh assaulted and picked up quarrel with me at			
three p m and at about four pm I poured kerosene on my own person			
Ah 			
At about four pm I poured kerosene on my own person			
So			
So within			
Article seizure of article seizure of			
Very well Your Honour I will first confine myself to seizure			
of article Your Honour 			
As far as Your Honour seizure of article is concerned I will			
uh humbly submit that as far as uh this uh blouse piece is concerned			
 and if Your Honour will notice then I don't know whether uh			
 yes I think this is the first front portion 			
This is the front portion of the blouse Your Honour 			
And as per medical evidence Your Honour there was a			
 injury burn injury 			
I will say major burn injury on chest and abdomen Your			
Honour 			
In that case Your Honour this blouse would not be have			
been intact Your Honour 			
This is intact because if your honour will see			
Ah this 			
If Your Honour will see the uh patti 			
Your Honour			
Ha			
Then it means this is a complete blouse 			
The only thing somebody has cut if Your Honour say that			
it may have cut uh by the C A uhm			
It is taken by the C A			
Yes that's Your Honour 			
Your honour my only submission is that looking into the condition			
of the bl this piece of cloth blouse Your Honour it is a			
full uh it is a complete one only it is in torn condition but			
not in burnt condition			
It is not torn here it is burnt 			
Your Honour but uh then I will submit that looking into the			
uh medical uh me me medical 			
evidence Your Honour 			
I will say that uh this is not a the 			
same blouse which could have been worn by the complainant on that			
day your honour 			
This is on that day 			
Yes 			
And uh same is my argument as far as two sarees			
 are concerned Your Honour two sarees have been			
produced but			
 Sarees 			
No Your Honour I am not on that point your honour 			
I am on different point now 			
As far as this is concerned I say it is not uh burnt but			
it is only in torn condition 			
But as far as this uh these two sarees are			
concerned Your Honour my submission is that that a person cannot			
wear two sarees at a at one time 			
And practically it is not possible to wear two sarees			
 uh on the time of alleged incident Your Honour 			
Therefore			
So 			
It was one word 			
Blanket			
Blanket a few words 			
Your honour if that is case then the prosecution has not			
brought on the record that uh why the two sarees 			
were used			
No no maybe			
Sir there is as I stated that there is no eye			
witness in this case			
Yes			
Therefore I cannot say whether this saree 			
was worn by that victim only thing is that whatever the officers			
found there has been taken charge under the panchanama 			
But looking at the burnt saree it appears to be			
the saree which was worn by the 			
Her			
Victim 			
And obviously that because we have to see the 			
circumstances that strata from which this community comes 			
And 			
So			
Strata society from which they are coming I know			
poverty 			
Yes Your Honour I fully agree			
They come from different strata you have to explain that 			
to her two words blanket 			
No Your Honour I am not expecting Your Honour 			
But my only humble submi 			
 A few words 			
Yes Your Honour 			
And uh for that reason only Your Honour nowhere in the F I R			
nowhere in the evidence of the P W or the dying declaration Your			
Honour it has some 			
 A few words if the articles are there the			
police have seized not uh			
Yes Your Honour 			
Yes Your Honour exactly this			
Then why it is not the circumstance			
Exactly the same thing Your Honour			
I want to submit that circumstances may not lie Your Honour 			
because two sarees are there why two sarees 			
are there Your Honour 			
 A few words 			
Your Honour in that uh in that way I will submit			
About say			
Your honour in F I R one gontat was there			
Do you agree statement			
Fully agree Your Honour and for that reason Your Honour I am			
submitting that uh because two sarees are there in			
F I R as well as in uh 			
 One word 			
Yes			
 A few words 			
No Your Honour as far as gontat is

Yes next para			
Mr uh Nanya appearing for the accused 			
has canvassed before this court that uh disposed that uh the accused			
is charged for the offence under section three nought two I P C 			
Fullstop 			
He has canvassed three points before this full uh 			
before this court for uh consideration 			
They are as follows 			
Point number one is whether this is a homicidal death second			
 whether that uh homicidal death was uh caused by the stabbing			
 the deceased by the accused and third if if it is so 			
what is the offence 			
Full stop 			
Next para 			
The learned special P P has uh canvassed before this court			
 prosecution has laid evidence of P W number one to seven and the			
documentary evidence to that effect in order to prove the			
point number one the learned uh special P P has invited the			
attention of this court to the evidence of Doctor Jaswant 			
Tampure and P M notes ex at exhibit fifteen 			
According to the learned special P P the death was caused by			
uh haemorrhage and shock 			
Therefore it was unnatural 			
He has also invited the attention of this court to the 			
postmortem notes and the opinion of the opinion express by			
Doctor Jaswant uh Tanpure 			
He has also canvassed before this court that one injury over the uh			
 person of the deceased which which can also be prove fatal 			
according to Doctor Tanpure 			
In the instance case the injury sustained by the deceased 			
was perforated uh was uh eh has perforated the wall of the 			
abdomen 			
That is the reason why there was uh Haematoma on both the			
kidneys because of the impact and force used in assaulting the deceased			
by the knife by the accused 			
Full stop 			
The injury was uh caused by a Rampuri 			
knife			
Full stop			
 Rampuri knife is not used for uh suicide by a			
person 			
A person committing suicide can commit suicide in the 			
house or uh at uh secluded place but not on the road 			
at uh ten pm 			
Therefore suicide eh uh suicide in this case if 			
canvassed by the defence is ruled out in all possibilities and			
probabilities looking to the uh nature of the injuries nature			
of the injury sustained by the accused 			
Full stop 			
Even on fall uh falling on the ss some sharp			
cut shovel uh object is also ruled out to cause uh accidental death			
Therefore all the probabilities and possibilities regarding of			
 injury by accidental and uh uh by accidental death is			
also ruled out 			
He has also canvass before this court that the defence 			
has not uh suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses in that respect			
that the deceased fell uh deceased met with an accident 			
In fact the learned sp special 			
P P has canvassed before this court that the defence of the accused is			
shifting the liability of this injury and the death of the			
deceased to P W number one two and three 			
Therefore the learned special P P has canvassed before this court			
that there is there uh there is and in all probabilities the			
deceased met with the homicidal death 			
Next para 			
He has further canvased in order to elaborate and uh			
 placed his reliance on uh second point is that that it is			
not the accused but it is P W number one two and three jointly killed 			
the deceased 			
Full stop 			
In this respect the evidence of P W number one two and three is			
on the record 			
They support each other 			
They say that the deceased and the accused are known to P W			
number one two and three as there are uh from the same locality 			
Therefore there cannot be mistaken identity 			
Provocation in fact was given by the accused to the deceased by			
saying caw caw 			
Full stop 			
Also in this case cannot be make available to the accused			
 because he gave provocation to the deceased 			
It was not a sudden sudden quarrel 			
Two parties at the outset were also separated by P W			
number one uh P W number one alone and uh and the same have cooled			
down as the accused thereafter went to his house and brought uh uh			
 Rampuri knife article one from his house 			
He has also canvassed before this court that the offence			
 in this case was premeditated for the reason that the accused			
brought a knife caught hold o caught hold uh caught hold			
of the deceased by his uh one hand and pressed the neck of the			
accused and stabbed the deceased in his abdomen 			
He has also canvassed before before this court that there is no			
time to connect the uh sto uh to concoct the story 			
because P W numbers uh two and three came on the scene of offence			
after hearing the shouts after hearing the shouts caught hold uh			
 the hand of the accused in which knife was there and ask P W number			
three to call police 			
Sufficient light was there at the scene of offence of the			
electric lampost of the municipal corporation uh on the road and			
from the shops in the surr uh in the surrounding vicinity			
Full stop 			
There is no animosity between the accused uh and P W			
numbers one two three 			
There is no substitution of knife 			
P W number uh four in this case is examined for uh taking			
charge of knife and P W number uh five for taking charge of article			
numbers article numbers one and uh two shirt and lungi			
 			
The lear next para			
The learned special P P has also canvassed before this court that			
the the blood group of the deceased could not be proved as			
uh C A could not uh give the conclusive uh conclusive evidence 			
and uh the same the blood uh the blood file which was sent to			
the chemical analyser of which the result shows inconclusive 			
The blood group of the accused appears to be of O group 			
It also appears on articles one two and three cough			
 the same blood of group O was also found on the above said uh 			
articles 			
The blood found on articles one two and three and article five			
 is also uh is also the same 			
If the blood of uh the blood group of O was also found article five			
 then it fixes the liability of the accused that the accused had			
 accused and the accused has only committed the offence in the			
instance case 			
Therefore the learned uh special P P has canvassed before this			
court that the intention of the accused was uh to assualt the			
deceased 			
Hence the learned speical P P states that he was uh he			
has proved the case against the accused and he may be convicted 			
The learned defence counsel Shri 			
Chari appearing uh for the accused has canvassed before this			
court that that the blood group of accused is admittedly of O group			
She has uh C A has also opined that exhibit numbers one			
two three and five were having blood uh of blood group O 			
In this case the uh uh accused assaulted the deceased			
 with article uh three knife 			
The knife article three is having blood group of O 			
Uh O category that is of the accused 			
The learned uh defence counsel then raised a query before this			
court and then uh and has canvassed before this court that in that			
case how is that that the blood of O group can be detected on			
article uh three 			
Because according to P W number uh P W number one two and			
three accused assaulted the deceased by article three and that the			
knife had uh uh on its blade 			
Full stop			
Admittedly that blood on the knife can also of the deceased of			
O group 			
Full stop			
It is possible that the deceased can have also the blood group			
 O 			
But iron of the blood sent to the C A for blood grouping of			
the deceased was analysed and the C A in his uh in this respect 			
uh in his report exhibit sixteen opined that the blood group of 			
uh exhibit uh one cannot be determined as the result results are			
inconclusive 			
He therefore uh doesn't say that the deceased was also			
having O group 			
But he says that the blood group of exhibit one cannot be			
determined as the results are inconclusive 			
Next para			
Then uh next question arises for the consideration 			
according to the learned defence counsel is that as to how the blood of			
the accused appeared on article three and five who was not assaulted			
by the deceased 			
No witness is saying that the deceased had uh also uh			
 also assaulted the accused 			
Full stop 			
According to Mr More therefore states that the			
accused is falsely implicated in this case and that he may be 			
acquitted 			
I have considered the arguments canvassed from both			
the sides 			
While considering the points raised by the learned by the			
learned uh special P P that whether this is a homicide			
death 			
Full stop 			
Looking to the evidence of P W number uh P W number six			
 Dr Jaswant Tanpure and P M notes exhibit fifteen and			
the evidence of P W numbers one two and three is prima facie appears			
to be a homicidal death 			
It can be seen that from the P M notes exhibit uh			
exhibit fifteen it appears that there is only one wound one injury			
 on the person of the deceased that is incised wound over 			
right apochondrial region 			
Just wait uh 			
Ah ha make this Your Honour uhm 			
Your Honour in this case the accused has been charged under			
section three hundred and two of the Indian penal code 			
In this case clears throat the case is principally of			
 this is a case of what is called circumstantial evidence 			
This is a case of circumstantial evidence 			
In all matters the relevant definition is the definition of the			
word prove 			
The definition is the definition of the word prove and that			
definition is always relevant and I'm reading that definition			
 A fact is said to be proved when after considering the			
matters before it the court either believes it to exist or			
considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought under			
the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that			
it exist 			
In other words the definition of the word prove in section			
three of the Evidence Act is a standard which is officially			
laid down for the purposes of highly given proof 			
This was later adopted in one case to which I will not come in this			
case I will come in a later case 			
Your Honour actually whether a given case is proved or not 			
has got to be admeasured with reference to this particular definition 			
In general sense			
This 			
In general sense 			
This particular definition section three 			
Now section three relates to three types of evidence actually			
The evidence can be direct the evidence can be circumstantial			
 and the evidence can be partly circumstantial and partly direct 			
But the standard with reference to which the proof of a case			
has got to be assessed is in section three 			
The standard with reference to which the proof of a given case			
has got to be assessed is section three 			
On section three as I said there are three types of evidence			
 direct circumstantial partly direct and partly circumstantial			
Now as regards circumstantial evidence the Supreme Court has			
 laid down certain guidelines 			
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law			
 that must be understood 			
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law			
 they're to be respected but they are not binding in			
the sense in which the interpretation of law is binding 			
They are to be respected 			
The reason is this			
What is the citation			
No I'm I'm coming to that citation is different 			
Yes ci you know that that is year nineteen sixty			
Supreme Court page one nine zero 			
I will give Your Honour later on 			
Page 			
One nine zero 			
My god this offence			
One nine zero			
Yes 			
Your Honour one nine five 			
Decisions even of the highest court on questions which are			
essential questions of facts cannot be called as precedents governing			
the decisions of other cases which must rest in the ultimate			
analysis upon their own particular facts 			
The general principles governing the appreciation of circumstantial			
evidence are well established and the and the broad 			
and beyond doubt or controversial 			
The more difficult question is one of applying this principles to			
the bare fact and circumstances of a particular case 			
Your Honour the point which we are trying to make out is this			
 those general principles are known 			
What is necessary is actually both application of			
this particular principles and taking the spirit of that particular			
principles and not the literal words 			
 I'll come to that and explain 			
From the first ever case after the birth of Supreme Court in			
nineteen fifty-two was what is called the Hanumanta's case 			
In year nineteen fifty-two Supreme Court page three forty-three			
Now here he is going to use it against me and I know it 			
No no it's alright 			
Continue it 			
Supreme Court 			
On page ?			
Three four three 			
That was the first ever Supreme Court case which laid			
down the general guiding principles as regards circumstantial evidence 			
And what the Supreme Court in that particular case said was this			
 			
The main three principles which were laid down there in that			
particular case were that the facts must be first established 			
They must have what is called the conclusive tendency and			
they must be incompatable with any other hypothesis except 			
that of guilt 			
These are the three basic principles which were laid down in			
 Hanumanta's case 			
And in the light of the principles which were laid down in 			
Sup by the Supreme Court in that particular case clears			
throat we shall try to assess whether in this case the facts			
 cumulatively drive this particular court to the conclusion that the			
accused and the accused alone has committed that crime 			
Your Honour has followed 			
Now let us go through the first case 			
So I will just 			
Yes 			
Your Honour the first point is this P W six and P W			
seven were the office bearers of Pushpavila's 			
Co-operative Housing Society 			
Yes 			
I have established 			
Ah 			
Have established that on the twenty-seventh of July			
nineteen ninety-one the accused was functioning as a watchman of			
that particular building 			
One 			
That is the first point 			
Yes			
And being a watchman and being on duty from nine am			
 on that onwards he was expected to be on duty throughout the			
day 			
Expected to be duty on 			
Throughout the day 			
Yes 			
Number two 			
Yes 			
Being a watchman he had an easy access to all the tenements			
 of that building 			
Now this is very important 			
Yes 			
This is important for this reason that no lady who is all			
by herself in a flat will open the flat to an outsider 			
No lady who is all alone in the flat will open the			
flat to an outsider but will readily open it to a watchman 			
whose duty it is to protect them 			
Yes			
Third 			
Since he was expected to be on duty throughout the day			
 he was expected to be available for help after murder			
Not yet 			
After 			
Supposing he has not committed murder someone else has			
committed murder and he is on duty 			
So he was not here			
It is he who is supposed to help that is what I am trying			
to say 			
Being on duty he was expected to help 			
Yes 			
Being a watchman 			
Yes 			
He was not only not available but was missing 			
and had to be traced through efforts 			
Your next point 			
He was not only not available but was missing and had to			
be traced through efforts 			
Yes 			
According to P W seven who is the Chairman of the society 			
according to P W seven who is the Chairman of the society 			
Yes 			
This is at page twenty-three 			
Yes			
He was wearing that check shirt which is article seven on			
that day 			
 A few words 			
When he was on duty 			
Both P W six and P W seven 			
This is article 			
Seven 			
Article seven 			
Your Honour this is very important I will give the list			
afterward 			
Article seven was stained with group blood			
 A group A according to			
the C A report 			
What is uh the group of uh deceased ?			
 A Your Honour blood group of			
deceased was A because according to exhibit			
twenty-nine 			
Yes twenty-nine is a exhibit			
According to exhibit twenty-nine 			
C A report			
C A report 			
The saree the petticoat the blouse the			
brassiere the curtain and the piece of curtain there are as many as 			
one two three four five six items which had A			
 group 			
Your Honour may take it down the saree 			
article three 			
Blouse 			
The no no we'll go in order uh Your Honour 			
 Saree article three 			
Petticoat article four 			
Petticoat 			
Blouse article five brassiere article six 			
Yes			
And curtain article two all these items bore			
 A group and therefore I say that the blood			
group of the deceased was A although when the blood			
 was taken and sent to the chemical analyser independently he			
could not say			
 Saree was wet			
No no no the blood of the deceased was taken by			
the doctor he could not conclusively say what group it belonged to			
because perhaps it had disintegrated 			
It happens sometimes that a given portion is disintegrated 			
but I say			
Blood was taken			
Yes also taken 			
But he could not express an opinion as regards the blood group 			
But I say that the deceased had A group			
by virtue of the fact that all these items had A group			
has Your Honour followed this 			
This is at twenty-nine exhibit twenty-nine will show this			
Have you examine the group blood of the accused			
Yes that is also A 			
That is			
 A 			
That is also A 			
That is exactly I will let let me complete the argument 			
One minute 			
Your Honour the point is although the blood group of the			
deceased according to exhibit thirty-one thirty-one is			
 A 			
Deceased 			
No no accused accused his blood group the blood			
group of the accused is A 			
The blood group of the deceased also is A 			
According to this according to this you mean the mark			
 this is therefore of 			
Yes that is the blood of the accused that is			
 A 			
I have taken care to ask the police officer at page			
thirty-eight para three I have taken the special care and 			
I'll read that 			
Earlier on twenty-nine seven ninety-one we had sent the			
accused to the hospital for obtaining blood 			
When the accused was first arrested there were no injuries on			
the person of the accused 			
 That's the point			
That is why this answer was taken 			
Your Honour I'm very vigilant about my duties			
According to			
 I'm very vigilant about my duties			
Have you established			
No no Your Honour we'll go to him later on I mean			
 Two words 			
Otherwise my link will be broken			
 Two words 			
No no 			
 Two words 			
Your Honour I'm not anxious to prove his blood			
lying on the saree I'm anxious to prove his blood			
lying on his own shirt that is what I'm trying to say 			
He could have well pleaded that he was injured and therfore he			
could have well explained			
But both on			
No no that is the main thing that is my argument that is not			
Whole circumstances uh			
No no no Your Honour allow me to complete otherwise the whole			
thing will be 			
Yes			
Your Honour article seven had blood group A			
 since he was not injured and since he was wearing that			
shirt the blood of the deceased has spurted on him that is what 			
I'm trying to say 			
The blood of the deceased had spurted on him the blood of the			
deceased has spurted on him on two items 			
According to the exhibit twenty-nine let me just add and			
it was here at page thirty-eight when he started the cross examination			
 my learned friend should have asked the police officer 			
Yes 			
And cross examined this police officer on the point of there			
being an injury 			
He should have asked the police officer 			
And he should have put the case to the police officer that			
the accused was also injured 			
That is the main point in this case 			
And he did not do that 			
Now the point which I am trying to make out there are two items on			
which the blood group is A article seven is one			
 and article 			
Two two seven but it have			
No no 			
On article seven is a shirt			
Shirt			
Shirt no no we'll forget Your Honour the			
deceased the blood on the deceased we'll forget because since she is			
stabbed it is going to be full of blood 			
We are trying to book him and therefore the blood on him			
is relevant blood on the saree is not relevant at all it			
is bound to be stained with blood 			
Total there are fifteen injuries on the lady so that is that			
presents more difficulty 			
The blood on the saree the blouse the petticoat			
and it is bound to be there 			
What about him 			
May I			
No no please please			
He says he has have had			
No no no you don't help anybody when I'm 			
I'm addressing I don't do you help yourself I can take care of			
myself 			
Your honour there are two items let it be very clear 			
there were two items on which the blood group on his person was 			
 A one is this shirt which he was wearing on the			
twenty-seventh when he was on duty at that building and when from			
which he ran away that is one 			
And the second is the shirt which he wore when he was			
arrested at Bombay Central police station and came back and which was			
taken on the mo taken charge of on the morning of twenty-eighth			
 which is article thirty-three 			
It is duly proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt			
 that is main point 			
My Lord in this case that only this was there were			
 two witness from the society uh the P W six and P W seven			
Now P W seven only he pointed out there are three watchmen are			
there My Lord three watchmen 			
Only he stated three watchmen uhn			
Two 			
Two two			
There are uh one he includes that the watchmens 			
 watchmen are here in the society from the north			
No when I come to read this thing no ?			
So data should be of three watchmen 			
No that I come to look at and then that what idea in			
the mind you've got then I am going to come to that point my lord			
Uh if there are three watchmen are there then I put the			
specific question Mr Pimpulkar did you recorded 			
record the statement of the if there were any watchman first point			
He says he has not recorded 			
Secondly nobody has from from the			
society or watchman or P W six or P W seven			
This is a registered premises given to to 			
 these three watchmen 			
They are residing together 			
And second thing they could the would be possibles			
have to prove the watchman should come and make a statement before the			
police officer or before the court that ke we are			
residing there along with this accused person 			
We are residing the this we are three watchmen of this			
building uhm 			
Yes 			
 Nahi uh que que 			
question if we put up the whether you have recorded a statement of			
the any watchman he say No 			
So it is burden of the prosecution that to establish the guilt			
on uh accu this accused 			
Here the watchman has to come say Yes this accused was			
residing there when this article seven was seized then 			
 no no not any watchman has pointed this is a shirt			
which belongs to accused number s this article belongs to this			
accused 			
There there is no evidence at all 			
Only the only shirt was found and then only on suspect			
 they drawn the inference my lord 			
Yes			
This is one aspect so there is no connection with the this			
shirt with the accused 			
When uh when this shirt was searched se 			
 sealed with when shirt was taken under the 			
panchnama my lord 			
Now now now next point uh next point my lord 			
Only P W six and seven said when this shirt was shown to them 			
when this article seven I'll argue only on this point article			
seven 			
When this shirt was shown to them they identified so question			
was put up before showing this shirt Whe 			
Did you Have you given description of this shirt 			
They said No we have not given description of shirt 			
Now page twenty my lord 			
Yes			
Page twenty my lord pa para 			
 six page page two two zero when he was cross examined I want			
that part my lord 			
Para para two para two 			
Yes 			
My lord may I read with your permission			
Yes			
I have maintained a register of society employees			
The employees would not provide any any form 			
I will not give them the description of clothes of the accused 			
in my statement before the police 			
So I do not recollect whether article shown to me in the 			
possession of panchas known by the police 			
Article shown to me I had not checked up the label of mark of shirt			
article and the article shown to me by police it was not taken out of			
sealed packet article seven not sealed in my presence after it is shown			
to me 			
With with great respect to my submission there are two things			
from the two things maybe gathered from this this evidence 			
Before showing this there there is no description 			
Second point when this shirt was shown He doesn't he			
doesn't he he do does not remember whether			
such whether shirt was shown in the presence of panchas 			
 or not 			
So therefore it is inadmissable under section one			
sixty-two ci ci Evidence Act 			
Because if it should be			
Shirt was not taken in the hand of in the presence of two			
 two panchas 			
No no they did not when when statement was recorded 			
inst of the P W six and P W seven and shirt was shown but it was			
not shown in the presence of panchas 			
This this uh uh article seven this affects article 			
which it was not shown in the presence of panchas 			
therefore it is hid by under section one sixty-two 			
Hence the statement must be seized and statement was			
recorded by by 			
It was recorded when the subsequent shirt was shown to			
them 			
So so that question is put whether this shirt was shown in the			
presence of panchas or not 			
Whether these shirts			
Article seven			
Ah ha			
Whether it was shown to in the presence of panchas			
What			
Shown			
It shown			
Shown disclosed			
Whether this shirt			
Sir was			
Or your point is that this article seven shirt was not shown			
in the presence of panchas P W six and P W and seven			
Seven yes my lord			
You wanted to prove that article should be shown in the			
presence of panchas 			
 Panchas yes my lord			
In the presence of panchas 			
If if it is if it does show on then it is hit hit by			
under one section sixty-two my lord 			
If it is sealed earlier uhm then it should be			
sealed should be opened opened in the presence of panchas 			
and then only it can be shown			
 Uhm 			
Yes 			
Well uh we now that that is one of if it is this shirt			
now their case is there when this shirt was first taken under			
charge of panchnama by the panch 			
number two uh P W two 			
And it is their case it was sealed if it is sealed if it			
is so sealed the seal should be b br broken			
 in the presence of panchas and uh and this			
shirt should be shown in the pr shown to in in the presence of			
 panchas 			
That is that is one aspect 			
I sugge after showing this shirt there there was no			
sealing that is most important my lord 			
Because this this shirt was shown to them there were no			
sealing and subsequently sent to C A my lord 			
After later days so many days 			
That is one point 			
My lord P W seven 			
After showing this shirt uhm to P W uh six and			
seven uh you normally your witness is one zero two			
 Uhm 			
 Uh 			
Only two six two is			
Apart from P W number six and seven it was not shown to the			
others			
No there there other panchas were there my			
lord 			
 One word 			
No they they would be just			
Article seven apart from a few words interruption			
So only they want to they they established that the article			
seven in connection with three my lord 			
So with my respectful seven that the P W six or seven they			
admitted possession before showing this shirt they have not given			
description of article if it is not given description article and it			
would not show in the in the pre if it sealed If			
it is sealed it this seal was not br br broken 			
 in their presence in so therefore we had doubt about this genuiness			
about this prosecution			
That is one aspect 			
Now my lord whether further if I may take further evidence my			
lord 			
That if P W two is mo most 			
important of the prosecution witness P W two Solid 			
Now page nine my lord 			
Page nine cross section para two 			
Para two my lord 			
My L i if when question was put when this article			
seven is there any passivity mark man 			
manufacturing mark manufacturing mark this I'll			
 read my lord the fourth uh uh			
Manufacturing mark of			
Means there is need no label mark label mark this			
shirt was there is some marking on this 			
Trade mark			
Trade marks so that I I trade mark trade tra			
 if it is really taken under panchanama they might			
pointed out before in the panchanama this is nino			
 mark that it is not so mentioned in the panchanama 			
This there is no reference of manufacturing label nino 			
article seven in exhibit eight similar shirts shirts like this are freely			
available in the market 			
So this there is I now say panchanama was			
explain 			
Now my lord the there is one point so similar question			
were put up P W six and seven whether there is any label or trade marks 			
whether did you point out in panchanama uh or in your			
statement or in panchanama they said nothing 			
My lord now 			
Now my lord P W two further says when this shirt was found on			
the flooring it uh he further says the blood stains mark mark by police			
with the pen 			
The shirt was then sealed and packed and labeled 			
So it is presumed that the return must have must have done at			
that time in the premises my lord 			
That is one aspect 			
Yes			
That is with uh why it is very important 			
This is a an incidence of the 			
panchanama on twenty-seventh July ninety-one			
Yes 			
That is there case it was sealed mark everything,			
Now my lord if it so my lord then this when they are			
searching at that time nobody was there only panchas 			
were there uh shirt was taken sealed

charged for the offence under session three nought two I P C 			
The prosecution has examine in all five witnesses and uh he			
has canvassed before this court that the reason for murder is that the			
deceased uh de uh declined and failed to join the			
accused in his venture of pick-pocketing 			
He has also at the outset canvass before this court that there			
is no direct eye witness to the incident 			
The whole case of the prosecution rests on the circumstantial			
evidence 			
He has further canvassed before this court that there are uhn			
 according to him three dying declaration one is the dying			
declaration made uh before C M Vinod Jayanta Dhamankar at P			
W number one the second dying declaration is in the nature of F I R			
And the third dying declaration uh to her mother 			
He has further canvassed that exhibit five the dying			
declaration was recorded by P W number one uh Malankar which is in			
the question and answer form 			
He has also canvassed at uh this stage that the defence may 			
object the prosecution that exhibit five has no endorsement of Dr Ram			
 P W number four to show that whether the deceased was in a			
position to make dying declaration or not 			
He has thus raised the query as to why the S E M was not uh			
suggested by the defence that he had not obtained endorsement of P W			
number five Dr Miss Maya Krishnaram Ram uh 			
Krisnaram Ram 			
What is the uhm necessity of obtaining endorsement of Dr uh uh 			
 Ram ?			
P W number three has also stated that the deceased was uh uh 			
with uh fifty-six percent burns on that uh he has deposed that in such uh			
condition the patient will be in a position to speak and that according			
to him P W number four has deposed before this court in his evidence 			
uh in his evidence 			
He has also canvassed uhn before this court that uh P W number			
two the mother of the deceased who uh also states that the patient was in			
a position to speak 			
There is no suggestion made by the defence to P W number one and			
two that whether the patient was in a position to speak or not 			
Uh he has then canvassed before this court that this court shall			
also consider the conduct of the accused 			
That the accused has reported the incident to P W number two 			
the mother of the deceased after going to her house and then telling that			
he would bring some money for medicine and went away and he did not return			
The learned special P P has then canvassed before this court as to			
why the accused ran away on the pretext of uh bringing uh money from uh			
for medicine 			
 E E if according to him			
the accused had not commi uh committed 			
the offence of throwing the uh lighted match-stick on the person of the			
deceased			
He would not have uh he would not certainly run away 			
Uh he has also canvassed before this court that the deceased had			
 actual actually talked with P W number two 			
which uh which according to learned special P P is third dying			
declaration 			
He has also invited the attention of this court that the deceased			
had uh deposed the truth uh uh truth how the accu uh			
 accused set her on fire 			
There is no suggestion to P W number two that her daughter was			
unconscious 			
He had also canvassed before this court uh that P W number			
three is Suresh Krishnaram Bane who has uh preferred the 			
po performed the post mortem and that he has examined			
 her to bring on record the post mortem notes 			
The learned special P P has further canvassed before this court			
that P W number uh four Dr Maya Ram has deposed in her uh 			
examination which was suggested to her to which she has replied that 			
uh on the left upper limb there was uh zero percent zero percent			
burns 			
The learned special P P then canvassed before this court that P W			
number five one word was at that time on duty and he recorded his			
own statement two words 			
He has also canvassed before this court that uh here again Dr has			
endorsed that the patient was in a position to speak on the one word 			
Exhibit sixteen and uh these confirm and supported by P W number			
four Maya Ram 			
The learned special P P has then canvassed before this court			
regarding the panchanama exhibit A that is the scene of			
offence uh of panchnama which is the nature of corroborative			
evidence on as the article uh saree blouse bottle 			
match-box etcetera that is in all six articles were uh recovered and			
had shown in in exhibit eighteen that there was kerosene on these			
articles 			
Lastly the learned special P P has canvassed before this court 			
that all the threee dying declarations are consistent and uhm there is no			
different version in this respect 			
Uh according to him each one of the dying declaration is sufficient			
to prove the guilt of the accused uh independently 			
He has also canvassed before this court that about the conduct of			
the accused that uh by not remaining present in the hospital uh 			
hospital show Shows that it is the accused			
only who is uh responsible for this offence			
He has also canvassed before this court that the neighbours of			
the deceased removed the deceased to K E M hospital and not the accused as it			
should uh should have been 			
The learned special P P therefore has strong uh seriously			
urged that he has proved the charge beyond a reasonable doubt against			
the accused and that the accused may be dealt uh with accordingly 			
Miss Dwivedi Trivedi the learned special P P clears			
troat uh appearing for the def uh defence 			
 has canvassed before this court that there is no direct eye			
witness to the incident			
She has canvassed before this court that the accused was charged			
for the offence under section three nought seven I P C at the outset 			
And that the charge uh appears to have been uh altered to			
section three nought two uh I P C 			
She has also canvassed before this court that this is a case of			
circumstantial evidence 			
She has also canvassed before this court that on the first			
dying declaration recorded by P W number one there is no endorsement of			
the doctor to the effect that the deceased was in a position to speak and			
to make the dying declaration 			
She has also canvassed before this court that the doctors			
endorsement is necessary to show that patient was in a position to speak			
The second uh point which the learned defence council has canvassed			
before this court is about uh procuring of kerosene bottle which			
according to her is silent 			
Uh the panchnama showed that the plastic was			
containing kerosene			
The learned defence council relied on the evidence of P W			
number two and has stated that the deceased poured kerosene uh from the			
kerosene lamp article four			
The learned defence council further canvassed before this court 			
that regarding the seizure of articles the blouse article number			
three ought to have been burnt if the deceased had burn injuries from			
chest to abdomen 			
However according to the learned defence council looking to the			
evidence of P W number one to five she has canvassed that the blouse			
article three is not burnt but it is torn 			
She has also invited the attention of this cou 			
 uh court to the two sarees in this			
case and raised the query as to how two sarees are taken			
charge of 			
The deceased cannot be expected to wear two sarees			
 uh at one and the same time			
Therefore according to her it creates doubt about this case in			
view of the uh production of two sarees by the			
prosecution

The news in detail 			
The Bonn talks on German reunification have concluded affirming			
 Germany's right to be united 			
The foreign ministers of the four victorious Allies of the Second			
World War and the two Germanies have endorsed the right of Germany to			
be united but there were differences whether united Germany should be a			
member of NATO or remain neutral

Later speaking at a press conference Soviet Foreign Minister Mr			
Schevernadze expressed optimism about the outcome of the talks and said			
Soviet Union intends to work constructively to accelarate the process			
of German unity 			
This may be possible after we two words yeah I am			
optimistically inclined I think we shall succeed all over these			
matters in finding mutually acceptable solutions 			
Mr Schevernadze however strongly opposed the NATO			
 membership for the United Germany 			
He said this will severely disrupt the military balance in Europe			
 and adversely affect Moscow's security interests 			
The U S Secretary of State Mr Baker said that four Allies of the			
Second World War should give serious consideration on issues relating to			
German reunification 			
But it is argued that this forum should take decisions only			
on those issues relevant to four power rights and responsibilities 			
It is our view that Germany must not be singled out 			
Thus many issues of significance interest to us here 			
we'll require consultation and decision in other more inclusive			
forum

the international scene 			
On the domestic front while traditional art has staged a revival of			
sort modern Indian paintings too are getting top billing 			
 Doordarshan correspondent Karuna Swarup Munshi			
reports 			
If the development of art can be traced to the evaluation of			
human consciousness then every object of art reflects a social mileau 			
Early human history in India offers clear glimpses of man's			
 love for beauty and nature much of which he expressed through his			
paintings 			
Traditional styles of painting have withered the ravages of time			
 and of late seems to be doing better than ever before 			
Blossoming out of the ethnic traditions yet independent of it			
is the contemporary Indian Art 			
Distinct in its character and varied in style it has carved a			
niche for itself

sell outlets

fakes are already posing a problem the younger generation of artist are			
not optimistic about their future

obstacles

feet

constructed platform

As for rules atleast six participants take part in one round of a			
rally and a person who completes the maximum number of lapse in five			
minutes is adjudged the winner

frequency

Gold has always been considered a status symbol in India 			
In addition people buy gold for security and this keeps			
them interested in its prices 			
The abolition of the Gold Control Act has resulted in a			
fluctuation in gold prices 			
We have this report from our correspondent Maya Sharma 			
Gold in our country is a precious symbol of wealth and			
security 			
But the gold market itself does not glitter quite so much 			
involving as it does inflated prices and large scale smuggling 			
The government's decision to abolish the Gold Control Act			
 was followed by an initial drop in the gold price from pre-budget			
level 			
But the cost of gold in India continues to be much higher than			
in the international market 			
The domestic demands of gold is estimated at two hundred and			
fifty tonnes every year 			
Less than two tonnes is produced by Indian mines annually and			
about fifty tonnes is obtained from recycled gold 			
The huge gap between supply and demand is filled to a large extent			
by smuggled gold 			
Those in the trade believe the current blanket ban on gold import			
 should be lifted arguing that this should bring down the gold prices			
 encourage export of jewellery and also curb smuggling 			
The government stand is that gold is not an essential item to			
justify expenditure of foreign exchange to import it 			
Whatever the government's decision and regardless of			
the price the desire for gold is only likely to increase

Whole blood need not be given to a patient any longer

 has come to India too 			
The Central government has recently set up a three point seven			
 crore rupee project in Bombay for this purpose 			
Our correspondent Seema Murlidhar has the details 			
Blood can now be broken down to its elements in India			
also 			
Broadly speaking human blood has red blood corpuscles 			
platalet and proteins like algumin fibrogin and immoglobins suspended in			
water 			
Each component has a specific role to play in the body 			
Uptill now whole blood had to be given to a patient in need of			
even one of these components 			
Now with the breakdown of blood at the plasma centre of K			
E M hospital a patient of anaemia can be given R B C's alone 			
or a victim of burns can get algumin only 			
A highly sophisticated technique called tromatography is being			
used for separation of blood components 			
This way one unit of blood which was being used for one person			
alone can now be used by eight 			
This can go a long way in overcoming the shortage of blood in			
India 			
And now we move on to Indonesia for an interesting piece of			
news

Doctors in a New Delhi hospital will now find it easy to treat			
patients of arthritis and kidney failure and myasthenia gravis 			
This is a new process that removes the disease causing agents from			
the blood itself 			
Our correspondent has more details for you 			
Doctors claim they can treat patients of severe lever and kidney			
failure arthritis myasthenia gravis and even poisoning 			
The process is called the plasma therisis 			
It filters out and discards a protein in the blood that			
becomes infected with disease causing agents 			
This protein is called globunil 			
All the patients' blood is brought into this machine			
In the first stage a filter separates the watery plasma of the			
blood from the solid red blood cells 			
The red cells are stored and will be returned to the patients			
body 			
The plasma contains the disease causing globunil 			
So this plasma is taken to another filter 			
This filter separates the globulils from the plasma 			
The infected globulils is collected into a bottle and will be			
discarded 			
Together the red cells and the clean plasma return to the			
patients body through connecting tubes 			
The head of Safdar Jung hospital's kidney department Dr			
R Shrivastav says In some cases of kidney failure you will			
not need dylesis for almost one year if you undergo plasma therasis			
 			
The process he says Deals with the cause of the			
disease and not its symptoms

Doctors in New Delhi yesterday performed the rare open heart			
surgery on one month old baby 			
Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the All India Institute of Medical			
Sciences said the surgery had to be performed otherwise the boy			
Jisukh would have died 			
After seven gruelling hours of surgery Jisukh is fine and			
he is under observation at the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital 			
Our correspondent Hemant Kumar has more details 			
This child had a serious heart disease 			
Two of his major arteries in the heart were cross linked 			
The human heart has four chambers 			
The right artium the right ventricle and the left artium			
and the left ventricle 			
The right artium and the right ventricle receive impure and used			
blood from all over the body 			
A blood vessel called the pulmonary artery carries the impure			
blood into the lungs for purification 			
The pure oxyginated blood then enters the left artium and travels			
to the left ventricle the pump house of the heart 			
From the left ventricle the artery aorta carries the pure blood to			
the rest of the body 			
In the case of this child however the two blood vessels 			
pulmonary artery and the aorta were wrongly connected 			
The pulmonary artery was connected to the left ventricle and			
the aorta to the right ventricle so that all the impure blood was			
returning to the body via the pulmonary artery and the purified blood			
was flowing back to the lungs through the aorta 			
The baby was turning blue for lack of oxygen and could have died			
had the surgery not been performed 			
What Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the Institute did was in			
several stages 			
First the child was anaesthetize a very difficult task to			
perform on an infant 			
Then his rib cage or the thorax was cut open and the			
frantically throbbing heart was exposed 			
His heart was then by passed 			
All the impure blood was rooted to an apparatus called the			
heartlung machine 			
It purifies the blood and returns it to the body totalling			
bypassing the heart			
So that it does not beat 			
The heart was then cut open and the arteries exposed 			
Then the arteries were switched 			
The Aorta was removed from the right ventricle and sewn to the			
left ventricle its natural place 			
The pulmonary artery was removed from the left ventricle and			
placed at the right ventricle 			
The entire operation took seven hours 			
And Dr Rao says it was only as risky as any other open heart			
surgery 			
But normally it has very high success rate

Kerala is the southern most part of India 			
We are having many theatrical art forms and			
performances as a part of our culture 			
Among our classical theatrical arts 			
Kathakali is the foremost one 			
Perhaps we may be able to point out Chakyarkuta			
 and Kudiyatam are the more			
ancient forms of classical art forms Kathakali is			
more popular 			
We have got Krishnanatam which might have			
 originated before Kathakali 			
Actually the first term used for Kathakali 			
 was Aatam 			
And the first performance was based on the Ramayana theme 			
 Ramanatam composed in seventeenth century			
or later sixteenth century by Kottarakartampuran 			
At that time this Ramanatam was not so			
sophisticated and it was not perfect in any sense 			
 Ramanatam is a story on drama 			
based on Valmiki Ramayana divided into eight parts just as 			
 Krishanatam is framed in eight days play			
form 			
 Krishanatam was popular in the south 			
northern part of Kerala while Ramanatam was popular			
 in the southern areas of the play uh land 			
 Ramanatam though was spreading			
slowly in throughout Kerala gradually another composer			
 Kotesampuran who lived in seventeenth century composed			
 four stories based on Mahabharata 			
Nivathakavachakalakeyavatham Bhagavadham Karmiri Karmirivatham			
 and Kalyanasaugandhikam 			
Among these four plays Kalakeyavadham became very popular			
 on the Kathakali stage 			
 Kot Kotechidambaran 			
composed these Aatakathas and uh they are very			
popular of course but the major contribution to Kathakali stage 			
by Kotechidambaran is that he has stabilized the wa 			
method of presentation of this atam making much			
improvements on Ramanatam technique 			
So the system evolved by Kotechidambaran was popularly			
known as Vettadda Sampradayam 			
And from Kotechidambran Kathakali 			
 became a sophisticated classical theatrical art of Kerala and			
uh as far as the visual aspect of Kathakali no major attempt was			
made to make a stabilisation in this art form 			
But in the later years there were many other styles			
just like Kannadikot Sampradayam Kapling art Sampradayam 			
etcetera 			
This Kapling art Sampradayam is the eighteenth century 			
modification made by one Kapliknot Nambudri which the then			
Maharaja of Travancore Shri Kartigeternol Dyamavarma 			
Kartigeternol Dyamavarma composed not only 			
atakathas but he made a uh technical book a			
theatrical book a theoritical book Balaramabharatam that is also			
 a very concrete evidence for the stabilisation of this art form 			
As far as the technique of Kathakali is concerned it is a			
combination of the three forms of abhinaya nrita 			
nritya and natya 			
And in Kathakali we find 			
padarthabhinaya in dense quality 			
As padarthabhinaya is there we find			
 bhavatmaka character also 			
Every word is being depicted on the stage by the actor 			
according to the word and according to the bhava 			
for the relevant context 			
And we find natya aspects we find 			
nritya aspect we find nrita aspect also 			
There are four types of abhinayam aangika aahariya			
 wachica and satvica 			
This aahariya abhinaya abhinaya or action			
based on the costumes is very relevent to Kathakali			
 			
The costumes are uh planned on the basis of 			
satvaguna rajoguna and tamoguna 			
There are different terms used for costumes pachha			
 minikka katti tadi kari etcetera 			
These are for various characters according to the story			
And uh in the uh aangika abhinaya context			
 we have to point out one very important aspect that is the			
gestural language 			
The hastamudras are employed in in a very			
 profused manner based on either natyashastra 			
 or hastalakshnadeepika or balarambharatam			
 			
Perhaps all these steps might have used by the uhm foremost			
compositors and actors 			
 Hastalakshnadeepika contain of course it is a			
Kerala text on gestural language uh this hastilakshnadeepika			
 gives a very good evidence for the aangika			
abhinaya technique employed in Kathakali 			
And all the actors see that they are basing on uh 			
hastalakshanadeepika where the twenty-four 			
hastamudras the samyuta mudra the 			
asammita mudra etcetera are uh used and utilised for each			
purpose 			
For example pataka tripatakam mudra kadagamugham uh			
shukatundam all these mudras are uh			
employed in this gestural language 			
Likewise the rasabhinaya the 			
satyakabhinaya for that the navarasabhinaya is			
very important for each and every character 			
We take valour singara karuna uh shoka			
 or uhm hasya all these rasas			
 are being depicted in Kathakali 			
but the presentation is on basis of bhavas 			
 Padarthabhinayatpada and bhavatmaga			
 is Kathakali 			
So bhava is being conveyed through each and			
every word of the composition 			
The actor is presenting his action on the basis of this 			
 pada 			
 Pada is sung by or the wak			
 wachikyabhinaya is performed by the			
musicians 			
The compositions are written in various ragas and			
 talas restricted to the Kathakali style 			
The that style of singing is often called as 			
 often called or referred as sopan sangeeta 			
 Sopana is a word used for a particular method			
of singing songs especially the geetagovinda songs on the steps of			
the shrine in every temple in Kerala 			
So that is called sopana style 			
This sopana style is being adopted in Kathakali			
singing uh eventhough there are ragas common to Carnatic			
music and sopana style of singing the method of singing			
the rendering of singing is very different in sopana 			
style 			
Uh Kathakali composers uh adopting the			
 sopana style and there is an evidence in the 			
Kathakali that uhn they incorporated item 			
manjutala 			
It is also called as melappada 			
This manjutala is a first portion of a 			
pada in uh Geetagovinda manjutala kunjatala			
kelisadane that portion is being sung at the beginning of			
every performance of Kathakali 			
And that denotes the adoption of Kathakali style from the			
singing method of a ashtapadi or Geetagovinda in the			
Kerala tradition 			
So in the actor is performing his action on the basis			
of the wachikabhinaya performed by the composer the			
musician			
The main musician is called Ponani the second musician is called			
Sengadi 			
Ponani and Sengadi with uh instrumental music cymbals			
 chengala or eluttalam are being			
used by the singers 			
And on the basis of the wachikabhinaya the			
actor acts on the principle of padarthabhinaya and			
 bhavatmaga 			
He has the freedom to uh present his uh quality and			
efficiency in manodharmatam or ilagiyatam 			
While in chuliyatam he actually imitates the			
words through expression and uh conveying the meaning through the			
gestural language just like pataka mudra kadagamughum 			
shukatundam sarpashirsham uh mrigashirsham etcetera 			
So the gestural language is very important in 			
Kathakali as it is important in Kudiattam also 			
But in Krishnanatam we don't find so much employment of			
gestural language			
There the dance technique is more important the nritya			
 and nrita are important while in 			
Kathakali natya nrita nritya are also uhm			
equally important 			
The another aspect of Kathakali we have to			
point out that we are seeing imitative action we are seeing 			
descriptive action we are finding symbolic action in 			
Kathakali 			
All these techniques are employed together in Kathakali			
 			
Kathakali actor will have to undergo a training			
 a rigorous training for six or more years under an able guru			
 to become a good actor 			
Uh and for that in Kerala the gurukula			
 system of coaching was pre prevalent 			
 			
Now it is almost faded and we are having certain institutions			
like Kerala Kalamandalam instituted by poet laureate Wallatol 			
Narayan Menon 			
He is the chief personality who worked behind the			
popularisation the modern popularisation of Kathakali			
 in modern times 			
The Kalamandalam Margi in Trivandrum and some other			
institutions are also giving training in this particular art form as well			
as it provides training in kodiattam mohiniyattam 			
 uhn and other similar art forms of Kerala 			
With regard to the literature of Kathakali we are having about			
five hundred stories based on the Puranas 			
 Ka Ramanatam of course is			
based on Valmiki Ramayana and uh Kotechidambaran stories 			
Unnai's Nalacharitam Iraimentam stories are based on Mahabharata			
And similarly we are having many stories based on Ramayana			
 Mahabharata and other Puranas 			
Yet Dakshayagam is a very popular story connected with			
 Shiva 			
Lord Shiva is punishing his father-in-law Daksha 			
And a quarrel between father-in-law and son-in-law takes			
place in a very dramatic manner 			
This theme is adopted by a poet composer of eighteenth			
century Iraimantambi 			
Iraimantambi was a musician a musicologist a 			
Kathakali composer and uh a very good art connoisseur who lived			
in the period of Shri Sadatinha Maharaja who was the 			
doyen of Karnataka music as far as Kerala is concerned 			
And uh Iraimantambi was a court musician court poet and			
uh very popular figure in the cultural arena of Kerala of the ninteenth			
century 			
Before that we have got Unnai Wadiyar who composed			
Naliyadadamaatakatha which is a four uhn days play uh based on			
Mahabharata 			
The Nala Damayanti katha is beautifully presented in the			
Nalacharitam uh with musical skill with literary skill as well as			
sufficient scope to action also 			
After that we can point out only this personality Iraimantambi 			
uh for his three plays Keechakavadham Uttaraswayavaram and Dakshayagam			
 uh very popular stories on the Kathakali stage 			
Beyond that we are having Ravana Vijayam by Tilimanur			
Vidwangoitambran and uh Duryodhanavadham by Waikkarmusud uh			
Tadagavadham by Weekasindambi who is the originator of the Kathakali club			
system in Kerala uh who has uh written some Kathakali plays also uh			
modified some techniques evolved some uh evolutions in the 			
methods on the Kathakali stage 			
Uh similarly we are having some later period composers also			
For example one man who lives till now Mali Madhavanna has			
composed a story on Karnashapatham that is also based on Mahabharata			
Modern writers uh try to adopt foreign stories in Kathakali			
stage 			
For example Kerala Kalamandalam presented this year a story			
on the basis of Shakespeare's King Lear 			
Uhn it was appreciated by foreign audience but I don't know 			
whether this will suit Kathakali stage fully well as the mythological			
 themes of our traditional style and we can not think of			
a a Shakespearean character with this pachha or 			
other costumes on the Kathakali stage 			
Another aspect we have to account with regard to			
 Kathakali is the musical aspect of uh this			
theatrical art 			
We have got in Kerala three major instruments of music 			
 idakya chanda and muyav 			
 Idakya is used for sopan 			
music or ashtapadi singing and uh muyav			
 is for chakyarkut and kudiattam			
 alone 			
While chanda and maddalam 			
are used in Kathalali 			
 Idakya has got some relevance in 			
Kathakali very rarely also 			
And this chan chanda 			
 and uh maddalam iluttalam and 			
kaimani this combination of Kathakali in			
 musical aspect is very important and just like aharyabhinava			
 this musical instrument also gives a very good impression on the			
whole art 			
 Kathakali is a total theatre 			
It is dramatic 			
It is musical 			
It is rhythmic 			
There is dance technique there are there is natya technique			
 there is nrita technique everthing is combined in there 			
And the total story is being present 			
Another aspect of the story is in kudiattam			
 and kuttu we find vidushaka 			
character 			
But there is no vidushaka or comic character			
in Kathakali 			
We are having dhirodatta dhirodhadata dhiralalita			
 and dhirashanta characters 			
These characters are ba coming from our Puranas and			
 uh Epics 			
So uh this type of nayaka characters uh			
 heroines like Damayanti or Uttara or Draupadi uh			
women characters they also uh participate in the action			
But the women characters uh are represented by men only 			
Major actors are men 			
They take the role of uh female characters 			
That is a peculiar uh aspect of Kathakali			
There are very few ladies who participate in			
 Kathakali 			
And there is a troupe also ladies troupe also 			
But that is not so popular 			
Mainly the main men take female role also 			
because uh Kathakali requires very rigorous			
training in uh aangikabhinaya aspect 			
Uh female dancers or actors do not undergo such severe			
training 			
Men only can face that uh annual training physical			
training 			
So kathakali is a performance			
 mainly acted by men and this is very popular 			
This is almost a temple art but it has come out of the			
temple walls and it is presented for social functions cultural			
functions and other uhn celebrations also 			
Every temple festival will have a Kathakali performance 			
one or two or three or any number 			
Similarly uh this costume makers the 			
productions everything of Katha every aspect of 			
Kathakali has become a predominant uh factor of our 			
 K Kerala culture 			
Just like we had Krishnatam troupes in ancient times we			
are having Kathakali troupes in modern times also 			
Uh it is almost a non-secular performance now 			
And we are having Kathakali pada kacharis 			
now 			
We are having individual presentations like putanamorcha			
 or some other story 			
Individual characters are being presented			
Now we have got a youth festival stage in Kerala school			
youth festival and college youth festival 			
There also uh there is much competition is going on			
between youngsters to present Kathakali in a			
beautiful way 			
So Kathakali is getting its			
popularity day by day and Wallatol has contributed much for our 			
uh present popularity of Kathakali 			
This classical theatre is uh progressing even though			
we have lost so many uh distinguished actors 			
The style of acting and the presentation of the art the			
standard of art is maintained almost in a very uh attractive 			
method 			
Thank you 			
Archaeology is said to be concerned with the digging of the			
past 			
Of its find coins form an important source of knowledge 			
Indeed several Kings and Chieftains would have remained			
unknown but for the unearthing and study of the coins issued by them 			
Further coins reveal the socio-cultural economic 			
religious and political life of those times 			
And hence the importance of numismatics that is the study of the			
coins to the understanding of our ancient Indian history can not be over			
emphasised 			
My talk is about ancient Andhra coins 			
In the evolution of the ancient Indian coinage earliest to be			
issued was punch marked coins which was first succeeded by 			
uninscribed cast coins and the later by the inscribed coins 			
The punch marked coins were in circulation between eighth and second			
century B C and these coins were probably in circulation for a little			
longer period in the south India 			
These coins had no dates and no inscription denoting the name of the			
King or the Dynasty to which he belonged 			
These coins had only symbols which were marked on them by			
punching technique and hence the name punch mark given to them on the			
basis of the method of their manufacture 			
These are some of the punch marked coins except one at the			
top which is made of copper rest of the coins are made of 			
silver 			
Majority of the punch marked coins are made of silver and			
very rarely copper and lead was used for making these coins 			
The punch marked coins were manufactured by two methods one is			
the cut-sheet process in which the metal was beaten into flat sheets of			
appropriate thickness and width and then the coin blanks were cut 			
When the metal was still soft the symbols were marked on			
them using different punches then the coins were weighed and if they			
are found to be overweight edges were clipped and hence majority of			
the coins ended up being irregular 			
Round and oval kinds were made by different technique 			
Weight globules of molten metal were fold into moulds and then			
were beaten flat and then the symbols were marked on them by punches 			
Hence the shapes of these coins varied from round oval 			
squarish rectangular to irregular 			
And what you are seeing is the obverse side of the			
coins 			
And punchmark coins have only symbols imprinted on them on the			
obverse side where as the reverse side is always blank 			
What you are seeing now is the reverse side of the three of			
the punchmark coins 			
This side is blank except for few indistinct 			
symbols which came to be called as the bankers or officials marks 			
Next let us consider when coins came to be issued for the			
first time in our country ?			
Majority of the numismatists are of the opinion that coins			
originated somewhere around eighth century B C 			
This assumption is based on two kinds of an evidence that we have			
got 			
One is the archaeological other literary 			
Whenever punchmark coins were found during the excavation 			
archaeologists determined the statigraphic level at which these coins			
were found 			
And next they find out what other material was found associated			
with them such as the northern black polished and polished gravier			
pottery and so on 			
These can be dated by radio carbon method all the available			
archaeological evidence confirms that coins were in circulation in our			
country from fifth century B C and later 			
But the literary evidence reveals that coins were issued in our			
country much earlier 			
 Arthashastra of Kautilya which was			
written in the fourth century B C mentions about punchmark coins 			
 pana and its fractions 			
It also mentions about ways of detecting counterfeit and forge			
coins 			
It is clear that coins were made in India prior to fourth			
century B C 			
 Ashtadhyayi of Panini was said to be			
written in the fifth or sixth century B C 			
It also clearly mentions about various types of coins like			
 pana nishka and satamana 			
Hence it is clear that coins were in circulation prior to sixth			
century B C 			
The earliest literary evidence that probably suggests about			
coins is Maitraini Samhita of Yajurveda 			
This text is said to be written somewhere around thousand B C			
There is a particular reference in this text about a lump of			
precious metal which some scholars feel that it was referring to coin			
 satmana 			
But not all scholars are agreed on this 			
From the literary evidence one could not be certain about the			
exact period when coins came to be first issued in our country 			
But the consensus seems to favour eighth century B C as the			
most likely date 			
Next I will say few words about the symbols that are found on			
the coins 			
No less than three hundred different symbols were recorded on			
punchmark coins alone 			
The symbols on the coins probably represent the king his			
dynasty the kingdom the capital city main town and so on 			
But at these length of time one could never be certain 			
that what each symbol represented 			
Roughly these three hundred symbols can be grouped into six			
broad catagories 			
First depiction of human figure either occuring singly or in			
groups 			
Second group consists of animal symbols 			
Four common animals depicted are the elephant bull horse			
and lamb 			
Other animals seen are the camel rhinosorous dog bear 			
peacock reptiles fish frog and so on 			
Third group consists of implements such as bow and arrow 			
ladder and ship 			
Fourth group consists of trees and flowers 			
Fifth group consists of astral and religious symbols 			
Last group consists of miscellanious symbols including Ujjain			
 and six arm symbol and so on 			
One general observation that can be made here is that the			
animal symbols are much more common in early series of punchmark coins 			
Whereas the hill symbol occurs commonly in later coins 			
There are two main types of punchmark coins local and imperial			
During eighth to sixth century B C our country consisted of			
many tribal states or janapadas 			
Local rulers of these states have issued coins for circulation in			
the respective regions 			
Magadha too started as a small tribal state with Rajgir in Bihar as			
the capital but later this state has become very powerful it			
expanded its territories then shifted its capital to Patna or Patilaputra			
And by the time this state came under the rule of Nanda and			
Mauryan dynasties almost the entire country was under their rule 			
And coins issued by these dynasties were in circulation			
throughout the country 			
And these coins came to be called as imperial coins 			
Both type of these coins local as well as the imperial 			
punchmark coins have very distinctive features 			
Local coins or the early coins and naturally they are very			
rare to find 			
They were of crude design and fabric 			
The symbols marked on these coins too are crude 			
Weights of these coins too varied from one gram to over twenty			
grams 			
The number of symbols on the obverse were usually one or two			
 but never exceeded four 			
In contrast imperial coins were of uniform weight of three			
point four grams or fifty-four grams in fresh mint condition 			
Obverse had only five symbols and the reverse was blank except			
for bankers marks 			
Occasionally these coins had counter marks of subsequent rulers			
Out of the five symbols two symbols were common to all			
these coins that is sun and the six armed symbols 			
Hence they are called as the first and second symbol 			
Third fourth and fifth symbols were from any of the three			
hundred and odd symbols found on the punchmark coins 			
These are called as the class group and variety symbols 			
What you are seeing now are the drawings of the symbols depicted on			
the obverse side of the two punchmark coins sun and six armed symbols			
are common to both these coins though the design of the six armed symbol			
does vary 			
One has four arrow marks whereas the second one has three			
arrows and three dot symbols marked inside the triangle 			
Third symbol on one coin is the one word whereas			
the tree and railing symbol with fish below is seen on the second coin 			
Fourth symbol on one coin consists of the four fish symbols 			
around a square with a dot inside all enclosed inside a large square 			
whereas ankusha thareen and straight line are seen on			
the other coin 			
Elephant forms the fifth symbol on both these coins 			
One coin belongs to one variety whereas the second forms			
another variety 			
Six hundred such varieties of punchmark coins have so far been			
described 			
I will now show you the various designs of sun symbol 			
Sun is depicted with varying number of rays varying from twelve			
to eighteen 			
In early coins rays are shown as oblique whereas in subsequent			
coins they are seen as radial or straight or horizontal lines 			
The second symbol came to be known as the six armed symbol 			
This symbol consists of a dot or a circle around which six			
symbols are marked 			
These could be either six arrows three arrows and three			
other symbols which may vary from fish oval rectangle tureen			
or any other kind of a design 			
Ninety different types of the six armed symbols have been 			
found on the punchmark coins 			
One more common symbol in later punchmark coins is the tree and			
railing various designs of which are shown in this chart 			
Another common symbol is the hill symbol 			
This is depicted as either showing three arches or arches			
vary from anywhere from five to ten 			
But three arched hill with a crescent at top is considered			
to be the Ashokan or late Mauryan symbol 			
I will briefly tell you about the characteristic features of			
the local and imperial punchmark coins that were found in Andhra region			
When it comes to the local punchmark coins one interesting			
observation was that all these coins were made of lead and the			
weights of this coins too varied to from one gram to over fifteen grams 			
The make of this coins too was somewhat cruder 			
But as for the symbols various symbols were found on them 			
But three common symbols that were there on these coins was a			
crudely designed sun symbol with lesser number of rays 			
Second chakra or a wheel symbol 			
Thirdly a crude design of a branch with leaves 			
These were the features of the early local Andhra coins 			
When it comes to the imperial punchmark coins that were found			
exclusively in Andhra region I would like to mention about the Amravati			
hoard of the punchmark coins 			
There were no less than seven thousand six hundred punchmark			
coins found at this site 			
It had two hundred and eighty-four symbols on them 			
Two hundred and thirty-five varieties of punchmark imperial coins			
 were found in this hoard 			
But what was interesting was that forty-eight varieties of			
this kind of a punchmark coins were only found in Andhra region 			
This means that even though punchmark coins of the imperial			
type of uniform weight and size with common symbols were there			
throughout the country but certain varieties were exclusively minted in			
each region 			
The second series of coins which were issued in our country			
after the punchmark coins were the uninscribed cast coins 			
These coins were in circulation between sixth to the third			
century B C 			
In some parts of our country these coins were the first to be			
issued and not the punchmark coins 			
In the rest of the country these coins were exclusively made			
of copper and hence the name uninscribed cast coins was applied to			
them 			
But majority of the coins which were issued in Andhra region			
 were made of lead 			
Even though these coins had various symbols four common			
symbols that were found on these coins are the hollowcross tarin			
 swastika and the one or two words 			
Surprisingly the hollowcross which was 			
very common in the uninscribed coins of this period does not figure on			
the coins which was issued immediately after that is on the inscribed			
coins which was issued in this part of the country 			
Seventy new types of previously undescribed 			
uninscribed coins found in Andhra region were discussed in our			
book 			
One message that comes through from this study is that though			
this region was under the Nanda and Mauryan empire still there were			
local rulers or authorities who issued a variety of such coins 			
Another important fact to be noticed is that with the			
introduction of uninscribed cast coins symbols came to be marked on			
either side of the coin whereas punchmark coins had only symbols on			
one side and reverse was blank 			
After the uninscribed cast coins came the era of the			
inscribed coins that means this coins mentioned the name of the king and			
the dynasty to which he belonged 			
But like the punchmark and uninscribed coins these coins too			
never mentioned the date of issue of the coins 			
And for that matter none of the Andhra coins prior to the			
medieval period ever mentioned either the mint's name or			
the date of issue of the coins 			
First inscribed coins that came to light in Andhra			
region belonged to king Gobhadra 			
He was a small local ruler in the Telangana region 			
If this is a copper coin issued by king Gobhadra obverse			
side shows the script in the centre a bow and arrow symbol at the top			
 and right lower part shows the arched hill symbol and tree and			
railing symbol to its left 			
These coins were followed by such kings as Naranna 			
Khambayasa and Samagopa 			
There is no literary or historical evidence of the existence			
of these four rulers Gobhadra Naranna Khambayasa and Samagopa 			
Only through coins we came to know the existence of these rulers			
These are two Samagopa coins one on the left side shows			
the obverse side of the coin whereas one on the right side shows the			
reverse side of an another coin 			
Coin on the left side shows the script in the centre and			
at the upper part you see a bow and arrow symbol and slightly to its			
left you see a part of the sadachakra symbol 			
At the lower right hand corner you see the symbol of tree and			
railing and to its left you see the tree arch hill symbol with dots			
inside 			
On the right hand side you see the reverse side of the coin			
showing the nandipatha symbol 			
Similarly coastal Andhra region was ruled by Meghvahana			
dynasty of Kalinga 			
There coins too have been discovered in recent times 			
Except for one inscription mentioning about the existence			
of the Meghvahana ruler there is no other literary or any historical			
evidence that how many kings ruled or became part of this			
Meghavahana dynasty 			
In recent times coins of these kings who ruled northern			
coastal region were found and coins give a clue of the names of five			
kings who belong to this dynasty 			
In the recent elections we have seen that 			
Sociologists are those people who forecast election results 			
have become even more important than astrologers 			
This is a welcome sign because it speaks of rationalization			
of social life and a an increasing			
recognisation of the need to ascertain public opinion before certain			
decisions are made regarding the life and future prospects			
of a number of persons living in a country 			
This is very important in a country like India where the			
size of the population is uh going to exceed a hundred 			
crores soon 			
And it is not enough that we have elections every five years 			
but we must ascertain public opinion at regular intervals on a number of			
issues 			
Now decision makers require a lot of information 			
for making decisions regarding planning of social change 			
regarding implementation of accepted policies and moreover 			
due to increasing democratisation of social life 			
We need from time to time more and more data as to what			
 people think on a number of issues concerning their			
interests 			
Of course elections are held every five years but then 			
the decision makers must know what exactly is to be done under			
 situations certain situations by doing social service or 			
 resorting resorting to what they say is one			
word or the measurement of public opinion 			
In other words social surveys are becoming more and more			
important these days uh in order to make decisions before certain			
policies are made 			
And students of social sciences especially those of sociology			
 political science economics etcetera must know what social			
surveys are and how they are done 			
Today we are going to discuss the broad outlines of what social			
surveys are and how they are done 			
In our social surveys a representative sample of the			
population or the universe uh about which we want to make			
 general statement is taken 			
They are interviewed in a proper manner 			
The data thus collected from the representative sample of			
the population is tabulated 			
These tables are uhm interpreted and then a report			
is given showing the results of the social survey 			
When we want to do research on a topic this uh topic is			
divided into aspects or dimensions or sectors 			
These sectors are further analysed into variables and when we			
want to do research in a subject we have first of all to identify the			
relevant variables 			
After identifying these variables we have to do social surveys			
That is social surveys are started only if the 			
releve relevant dimensions and variables 			
in a problem have already been identified 			
Social surveys are done in order to ascertain how big 			
or how small the effect of these variables is 			
That is what is the magnitude of these variables 			
Then social surveys also enable us to ascertain the			
relationship between these variables and also to uhm			
formulate or to and to test uh hypothesis			
 about the relationship between these uh uhm uhm variables as			
also which of these hypothesis is to be accepted uh and which of			
these is to be rejected and which of these can be modified in order to			
come to certain conclusions with a known degree of confidence 			
Now the question arises what a variable is ?			
Let me explain it with uh an example 			
Suppose we are doing research on social tension 			
prevalent in uh many parts of India 			
This is our problem for analysis that is social tensions in			
India 			
Now there can be several uh sectors dimensions or			
aspects of social tensions in India 			
And these may be due to the due to factionalism			
 one factor of social tensions another factor uh factor of social			
tensions may be uh religious inter-religious and inter-caste			
rivalries 			
Still another factor of social tensions may be for example			
 uh widespread unemployment 			
Now factionalism inter-religious and uh 			
inter-caste tensions and thirdly unemployment these can be said to			
be the three factors of the problem under study that is social			
tensions in India 			
Each of these factors is further composed of or can be			
analysed into a number of variables 			
And these variables may be for example age may be for			
example gender may be for example rural urban background or			
may be for example uhm exposure to mass media and so on and so forth			
Therefore a problem can be analysed into factors and			
factors can be further analysed into variables 			
The task of social surveys is after we have identified these			
variables to find out their magnitude their mutual relations and			
if possible whether they are closely connected or not			
The social anthropologists often use participant			
observation for this purpose 			
And some others may use the case study method for this purpose			
Then social surveys are done but be sure that the			
survey method is not suitable for ascertaining the cause and effect			
relationship between variables 			
For that we have to go beyond the survey method to 			
perform experiments in order to ascertain the uhm relations 			
cause and effect relationship between variables and to say uh certainly			
that certain variables precede certain other variables invariably			
 and some vari uh and the relationship between 			
the these variables is asymetrical 			
That is when we want to say that X is the cause of Y 			
then uh we must be able to produce evidence with the experimental method			
that X invariably precedes Y and X and Y cannot occur unless X occurs			
In other words social surveys like between uh the			
experimental method which is used to ascertain the cause and effect 			
relationship between variables and on the other hand the case			
study method or the method of participant observation which is used to 			
identify the relevant variables involved in a problem 			
A social survey cannot do all these things uhm but then			
 the survey method is the grant trunk road or the most important			
method or the raajpath of social research 			
And it can uhm this is one of the several methods used in			
social sciences 			
Be sure this is the not the only method but the most			
important method of social surveys 			
As I said earlier social surveys are done with the help of			
a representative sample of the population or the universe under study			
What do we do ?			
We formulate or we prepare a an interview			
schedule or a questionnaire or an interview guide and either we			
sent the questionnaire by post to a representative sample of the			
population properly selected by using statistical criteria or we			
go ourselves or send our interviewers to interview these people on the			
spot in a face to face situation with the help of an interview			
schedule or an interview guide 			
In the western countries telephone surveys are being used 			
more and more frequently more and more often 			
But in India since many people do not own telephones 			
surveys can hardly be done with the help of uh telephones except			
 on a few problems where the upper middle class is being studied 			
and the problem is such that interviews with those uh who possess			
telephones are enough 			
In practice most surveys are done with the help of			
interview schedules 			
A researcher uh sends his interviewers to say two			
thousand uhm persons around the country these are known as			
respondents and the interviewers ask them a number of questions 			
Now an interview schedule has to be prepared in a proper			
manner 			
Since we have to make generalisations make general			
statements about a large number of uh people what we have to do			
is to ask them the same questions in the same situa 			
 in the same sequence ensuing that not only the wording			
of the question is standardized not only the sequence in which the			
questions are asked is standardized but also the situation in which these			
uh questions are asked is standardized so that we can be sure that			
all the respondents all the persons being studied have been asked the			
same question and not a slightly different question 			
After the interviewers or the research assistants have			
filled in the interview schedules these are sent back to the institution			
 or the university department where the researcher is situated 			
The data from the interview schedules are coded on uh code			
sheets then these are punched on code cards or otherwise			
transferred to a computer readable medium like a uhm magnetic tape or			
like a floppy disk 			
These are fed into the computer 			
The computer enables us to process these data and			
prints out uhm a number of tables 			
These tables are then uh interpreted by inspection or by			
applying certain statistical measures like the Chi-square or several			
other types of statistical methods 			
And then these interpretions pretations are put			
together in the form of a research report 			
The research report provides us answers to the questions			
 we started with			
That is uh the questions which are to to			
which answers are needed by the researcher as well as the			
sponsor that is the person who or the institution who have uh or has			
financed the conducting of this uh survey and has uh made			
it possible for the researcher to perform all the operations and take			
all the trouble of going through from the process of preparing the			
research design collecting the required data with the help of an			
interview schedule processing the data analysing the data and uh			
 uh writing the research report 			
The research report may provide us answers as to for			
example what is going to be the outcome of the coming			
elections ?			
In other words social surveys are becoming more and more			
important these days uh in order to make decisions before			
certain policies are made and in order to implement these decisions make			
the implementation of these decisions easier and and			
 so on and so forth 			
The survey method is as I said the most important method of			
social research 			
Familiar incidents do not usually excite our curiosity 			
We look at them and we take them for granted 			
We do not ask what makes them happen ?			
How they are connected with the rest of the universe ?			
It was one of these mundane incidents which excited the			
curiosity of Issac Newton 			
He saw an apple fall from a tree 			
It made him wonder whether the law of nature that made the			
apple fall would also make the moon fall towards the earth 			
He was taking a great intellectual leap from the apple to the			
moon 			
He was not content with having seen this event with his physical			
eyes alone 			
He was trying to see a hidden connection behind the phenomenon			
 with his intellect the third eye 			
What is the connection that Newton saw betweeen the apple			
and the moon ?			
Let us look at the moon 			
If the earth did not attract the moon the moon would have			
travelled in a straight line and escaped to infinity 			
The earth's attraction provides the centripidal force 			
that bends the moon's projectory continuously from its			
linear projectory 			
One can therefore say that the moon is continuously falling			
towards the earth's centre 			
It is exactly analogous to the case of the spacecraft that we			
talked about in an earlier episode			
Now if the earth's gravity extends upto the orbit			
of the moon and this force decreases as the square of the distance			
from the earth's centre 			
It is easy to calculate the acceleration of the moon as it falls			
 from a knowledge of the acceleration of the apple 			
Since the moon is sixty times as far from the centre of the			
earth as the apple its acceleration should be sixty multiplied by sixty			
that is three thousand six hundred times smaller than the apple's			
 acceleration 			
The remarkable thing is that this gives the right answer for			
the moon to go once round the earth in twenty-eight days exactly as			
observed 			
This was Newton's famous moon test 			
In fact in the beginning he used a slightly wrong value for the			
distance of the moon from the centre of the earth and therefore got a			
slightly wrong value for the lunar month that made him wonder for a			
while as to whether there was something other than gravity which			
affected the moon's motion 			
He therefore didn't publish his results until much later 			
The primitive concept of forces arises from our experience of			
 pushes and pulls 			
Newton made a tremendous intellectual leap from such a concept			
of contact forces to the concept of forces such as gravitation 			
which act over a distance through empty space 			
This is how he made the leap 			
Consider the uniform inertial motion of a body in a straight			
line covering equal distances AB BC CD DE and so on in			
equal times 			
Let the points A B C D E etcetera be			
joined by a straight line to the point P not on the line of motion			
Then the successive triangles all have equal bases AB			
 BC CD DE etcetera and the same height H from the			
base 			
Therefore they all have the same area 			
Since these equal areas are swept out in equal times this is			
clear that inertial motion traces out equal areas in equal times 			
Now Newton supposed that the body received a succession of			
blows at regular intervals 			
All directed towards a common point P 			
Then the direction of motion would change at every blow and the			
body would coast along inertially in a straight line between these blows			
The linear path would thus be converted into a polygon whose			
sides would still determine consecutive triangles of equal areas with			
respect to the point P 			
Now says Newton let the time between successive blows become			
smaller and smaller then the number of blows and triangles would increase			
 and the width would decrease 			
In the limit of arbitrarily small intervals of time the			
projectory would be a continuous curve 			
This is the crucial point 			
It lies at the very heart of calculus 			
This limiting procedure enabled Newton to make a transition 			
from a succession of discrete blows to the concept of a continually			
acting force directed towards a common point a central or centripidal			
force causing curvilinear motion 			
And he discovered that bodies moving under the action of such a			
force would trace out equal areas in equal times 			
This is Keplar's second law of planetary motion 			
Notice that Newton arrived at the concept of an attractive force			
acting over a distance as a mathematical limit of a succession of direct			
impact 			
He wrote what I call attraction may be performed			
by impulse or by some other means unknown to me 			
I use these words here to signify in general any force by			
which bodies tend towards one another whatsoever be the cause			
 			
He didn't pretend to know the cause of gravity 			
Could it be due to a shower of ethereal particles or was			
it is as Descartes had imagined ?			
Newton was curious but he couldn't decide 			
He left the question open 			
But what is important is that he didn't stop there 			
He simply assumed the existance of gravity and proceeded to			
work out its consequences 			
This pragmatic approach was essential for the progress of			
science in his time but it was completely misunderstood by many of			
his eminent contemporaries 			
It led to a lot of unnecessary and bitter controversy 			
Having shown that a centripidal force acting continually would make			
a body move in a curve that traced out equal areas in equal times he			
also proved the converse namely that this area law employed a motion in a			
central force speed 			
Since the area law held for planets it became clear to Newton			
that the force acting between the sun and the planets must be a central force			
He had earlier deduced from Keplar's third law of			
planetary motion that a circular orbit employed a force that			
decreased as the square of the distance from the centre 			
Armed with the discovery of calculus he was now able to show 			
that under a central force that decreased at the square of the distance a			
planet would describe an elliptic orbit 			
In other words he derived Keplar's first law of			
planetary motion from causal principles 			
Now this derivation of Keplar's empirical laws 			
held only for an imagined system a hypothetical point particle moving			
around a centre of force in a perfect vacuum 			
The real world is of course much more complex 			
Newton therefore didn't publish his results 			
In the mean time Robert Hook quite independently hit upon the			
idea that the attraction between the sun and the planets fell off at			
the square of their distances 			
However he couldn't work out what the orbits would be under			
such an attractive force 			
He tried to get Newton interested in the problem and wrote to			
him in January sixteen hundred and eighty 			
But Newton didn't reply as an earlier controversy with Hook			
about the nature of light had offended him 			
In London there were two other men who were also			
working on Hook's problem 			
Christopher Wren the famous architect of Saint Paul's 			
Cathedral and Edmund Halley 			
In August sixteen eighty-four Halley who was younger than			
Hook and more tactful went to Cambridge on horseback to find out if			
Newton could help 			
A contemporary account states without mentioning either his			
own speculations or those of Hook or Wren he at once indicated the			
object of his visit by asking Newton what would be the curve described by			
the planets on the supposition that gravity diminished at the square			
of the distance 			
Newton immediately answered an ellips 			
Struck with joy and amazement Halley asked him how he knew it			
 ?			
Why replied he I have calculated it and being asked for			
the calculation he could not find it but promised to send it to			
him 			
This was the beginning of the writing of Newton's 			
Principia 			
Perhaps the greatest book on physical science ever written 			
It took him nearly three years of incredible labour 			
He submitted it to the Royal Society on twenty-eighth April			
sixteen eighty-six 			
One of the greatest days in the history of science 			
It was finally accepted by Samuel Peeps the president of the			
Royal Society and published in sixteen eithty-seven 			
It would not have seen the light of day had it not been for the			
constant coaxing and persuasion by Halley who even paid for its			
publication 			
It consisted of three books written in Latin in which 			
Newton developed a full dynamical theory encapsulated in his three laws			
of motion 			
The third law is the most original of his three laws and			
appears for the first time in the Principia 			
Newton generalised the experience of direct collisions of			
bodies like billiard balls acting mutually on one another to the case			
 of four types of forces including attraction 			
The third law is not however applicable to every case 			
Nowadays we believe that all signals or forces have a finite			
velocity of propagation 			
It is therefore not applicable to them because it talks			
about forces of action and reaction being equal as measured at the			
same time 			
We therefore don't expect it to be very good say in the case of			
atomic category 			
It is however perfectly applicable to the collisions of			
billiard balls cars and so on 			
As I have said earlier Newton's derivation of 			
Kepler's empirical laws held only for an imagined system a			
hypothetical point particle moving around the centre of force in a			
perfect vacuum 			
A physically impressed force must be directed towards a real			
physical body 			
So Newton next introduced a second body in place of the			
mathematical centre of force to simulate the sun and a single planet			
And he assumed that they were both spherical in shape and			
attracted each other with equal and opposite forces 			
After much effort lasting over a number of years Newton			
obtained the remarkable mathematical result that a gravitational			
attraction of a homogeneous spherical body or shell on a mass point			
outside it was the same as though its whole mass was concentrated at			
its centre provided gravity fell off at the square of the distance			
This justified his earlier treatment of the sun and the planets as			
 point like objects 			
He next showed that in such a system each body would move in an			
orbit around the common centre of mass 			
If one of the bodies were much more massive than the other as			
is the case with the sun and most of the planets the centre of mass would			
practically coincide with the more massive body 			
Since nearly the entire mass of the solar system was concentrated			
in the sun the planet would really move around the sun which would			
remain practically stationary 			
A dynamical justification of the Copernican system that Galileo			
was unable to provide 			
The final feature was the introduction of other mutually			
interacting bodies to produce a system like the sun and all its planets			
Here his third law about the equality of action and reaction			
played a crucial role 			
The discovery of this new important principle almost			
inevitably led to universal gravitation 			
Newton systematically showed that the same force of gravity			
that acted between the earth and the moon also acted between Jupiter			
and its satellites between the sun and all the planets and			
between every pair of planets and that every action was mutual by the			
third law of motion 			
He was thus led to the concept of universal gravitation a			
force that acts mutually between any two samples of matter anywhere			
in the universe 			
Newton applied his powerful theory to show that the tides on			
the high seas were caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the			
sun 			
He argued that the gravitational force exerted by the moon 			
on the ocean waters on the moonlit side of the earth was stronger 			
than the pull on the moonless side because gravity decreases the distance			
As a result of this the ocean waters assume an elixoidal shape			
 with two bulges one on the moonlit side and the other on the opposite			
side 			
The sun has a similar effect on the oceans but being much			
farther away its effect is weaker than the moon's 			
Also the solar and lunar tides do not always coincide 			
The sun and the moon act in the same direction whenever the			
moon is either new or full and then we have exceptionally high tides 			
At other times the total effect is much diminished 			
With the powerful tool of calculus at his command to give shape to			
his daring imagination Newton demonstrated convincingly that 			
gravity held sway over the entire solar system 			
In one sweeping stroke he unified celestial and terrestrial			
motion under a single concept 			
The great Irish philosopher George Bernard Shaw once made 			
the following mischievous remark about Newton Copernicus			
proved that Ptolemy was wrong Kepler proved that Copernicus was			
wrong Galileo proved that Aristotle was wrong but at that point			
 the sequence broke down because science then came up for the			
first time against that incalculable natural phenomenon and Englishman			
To explain why all the lines in his rectilinear universe were bent			
 he invented a force called gravitation and thus erected a complete			
 British universe and established it as a religion which was devoutly			
believed in for three hundred years 			
That was George Bernard Shaw 			
But the famous English poet Alexander Pope wrote 			
 Nature and nature's laws lay hidden in night God			
said let Newton be and all was light 			
 			
Graham Greene recently celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday 			
He can now look back on a career in writing which has covered			
over sixty years 			
This programme pays homage to Graham Greene whom many critics			
regard as the finest author never to have won the nobel prize for			
literature 			
In order to understand what a writer or a poet is about			
 it is most important to know something about his background and his			
life 			
Graham Greene was born on the second of October nineteen hundred			
and four at Birkamstate 			
Uh his father was the headmaster of Birkamstate school			
And that is where Graham Greene did his earlier education 			
He won a scholarship to go to Belliol College Oxford 			
And it was at Oxford that he first started writing 			
Uh his first work was a collection of poems called 			
Babling April 			
Soon after he left Belliol he converted to Catholicism 			
married a catholic lady 			
The marriage wasn't very successful and it ended in a divorce			
Uh Greene went through a very long period of extreme depression			
He continued writing 			
He wrote three novels			
None of them which he rated very high and although they			
were published he later disclaimed having done them and refused to allow			
them to be reprinted 			
He worked for a time in the Times of London			
 and The Spectator and did a lot of journalism			
And then he began his travels 			
He travelled extensively 			
He is one of the most widely travelled authors uh in the			
world today 			
Uh he went specifically to look for material for his books 			
he stayed a long time got to know the people and got whatever he wanted			
for his novels 			
Uh his first successful book only in terms of uh sales was			
 Istanbul Train uh based on the Orient Express 			
It wasn't very uh outstanding but it gave him a break			
He got recognised and was taken a little more seriously then he			
had been with his first three novels 			
Then followed a veritable flood of books and of all kinds			
 books of poetry books of travel adventure detective stories essays			
 childern's books you name them and Graham Greene was writing			
them 			
Uh it really in the sheer output it is hard to find			
anyone who did such a vast range of writing 			
Therefore it is really very difficult to put any kind of lable on			
him because he wrote on just every single topic that even you can think			
of 			
However uh three or four of his books were really taken very			
seriously and uh one can see in those uh novels uh			
particularly the ones I will mention later were some kind of his			
philosophy of life comes through 			
Now what kind of uh belief did Graham Greene have ?			
As I said before he is a Catholic but in politics he was			
pretty close to being a communist 			
He is an extremely extreme leftist uh knew and admired people			
like Fidel Castro of Cuba 			
Uh he was denied a passport uh a visa to the United States			
because of his leftists leanings 			
It was again very wrong to try and lable him even in politics 			
He is convinced in his writings that you cannot really make			
black and white decisions or black and white distinctions there is a			
vast grey area uh which really has more truth in it 			
In his first volume of his autobiography called A sort of			
life which he uh wrote in nineteen seventy-one 			
He talks of what he calls an epigraph to his earlier novels			
and quotes Bishop Bagrum's apology and goes something like			
this Our interests are on the dangerous edge of things our			
interest are on the dangerous edge of things the honest thief the			
tender murderer the superstitious atheist 			
Now you can see the contradiction in terms here 			
And in the second volume he makes it even clear			
The second volume being known as The ways of escape			
 			
He talks of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God 			
So you can see that there was no distinct line between			
right and wrong goodness and badness 			
While I was looking through uh uh notes making 			
preparing on Graham Greene to talk about him I was struck by a strange			
coincidence that he was born on the second of October which also			
happens to be Mahatma Gandhi's birthday 			
Uh I don't believe in astrology but I was very curious to know			
 if there was anything in common between these two men as is			
maintained by astrologers that people born under the same combination of			
stars have similar careers 			
Now obviously there wasn't really a to the outword eye very			
much in common 			
Uh Gandhi was a devout Hindu a pacifist who only wrote			
because he wanted to convey his message 			
Greeen on the other hand was an Englishman a Catholic and his			
primary interest was writing not a mission that he like Gandhi had			
But there was one thing very common between the two 			
Both were deeply concerned with the lowest of the lowly 			
 Gandhiji's interest was with harijans 			
landless peasantry and those who had been indiscriminated against in			
 his own country 			
He didn't bother about rest of the world very much 			
He travelled very little apart from his studies in England			
and this couple of years he spent in South Africa as a lawyer and			
then once as the member of the round table conference this uh 			
representing the Congress party all his travel			
was rest of his travel was in India 			
Graham Greene hardly ever lived in England his native country and			
he was travelling all the time 			
But while Gandhiji looked to the poor in his country Graham Greene			
was most concerned with drop outs in of society in all parts of the			
world 			
His main characters are uh thieves robbers uh			
drug-pedlars the scum of society 			
Now the other thing uh where the two have some kind of			
contrast Gandhiji believed in the innate goodness of man 			
He believed that there is something fundamentally good in every			
person and if it appealed to uh the man could be changed completely			
Now Greene was not so naive 			
He does not believe in the innate goodness of man he believed			
that something good in the worst of us and something bad in the best of			
us 			
And he was closer to the reality 			
Third thing which uh is of interest is that uh both			
were concerned with the struggle between good and evil uh the			
eternal battle between right and wrong 			
Gandhiji uh being devoutly religious uh belief 			
believed that ultimately goodness always triumphs over evil 			
 Satyamev Jayate 			
Now again Greene was not so naive to believe that uh the			
good always triumphs over bad that uh truthfulness always scored			
 over evil because he saw that many times people good			
people suffered and evil people prospered 			
Uh I think these were the things that I think one should bear in			
mind when comparing the careers of these two people 			
Now I come to some of his books to illustrate 			
I think the three best known uh and most seriously taken by			
critics are Brighten Rock is one and 			
Power and the Glory is another one and Heart of the			
Matter is the third			
I think they are the three most outstanding works of Graham Greene			
Now Brighten Rock concerns itself with the			
career of a young delinquent a catholic Pinky his one ambition			
in life is to get the better of Olioni a bigger racketier who has made a			
lot of money 			
Uh Pinky has a catholic girl friend called Rose 			
He is a drunkard			
He is a violent man 			
And in the process of trying to become the leader of the gang			
 he kills an innocent journalist 			
Then he picks up the young protestant girl Ida and they			
have an affair for a long time and Ida ultimately really brings him			
to justice and he is taken arrested 			
Here you see although Greene was a catholic and his main			
character Pinky is a catholic uh the person who betrays him but for the			
goodness for the right cause so that justice is done is a girl of			
loose morals a protestant girl called Ida 			
You see this even in more uh clarity in the what I			
think is probably is very best novel The Power and the Glory			
This is set in Mexico at the time of uh severe persecution			
by the state of the catholic church uh the police were hunting 			
for uh catholic priests murdering them bringing them putting them			
in jails 			
And here we have two characters uh catholic priest one is a			
drunkard uh he has a mistress he sired a bastard child through her 			
The other has taken a vow of chastity and yet gone and got married			
So both in that sense have defied with the basic tenets of			
catholicism 			
And they are on the run from the police 			
This priest who has uh sired a bastard child and is			
drunkard is successfully getting out of the country in just as he is			
coming close to the border and to freedom he gets a message that a poor			
peasant catholic person is dying and he would like his last sacraments to			
be performed 			
He takes the risk of turning back to go and perform the last			
sacraments is caught and executed uh by a police man who is also a			
good man but he wants to do justice 			
Here you see the mixture of characters uh catholic priest			
drunkard uh siring illegitimate children and yet when it comes to the			
final test atleast giving up his life and becoming a martyr 			
And the third novel uh Heart of the Matter 			
 it is set in West Africa 			
Here we have a character uh deputy commissioner of police uh			
Scobie who is a good upright man 			
Uh he has a rather eccentric wife Louise who dabbles in writing			
Uh he has a lady friend a young widow called Helen 			
And it is going on alright till slowly he begins to uh get			
caught in a whole plot where a innocent journalist is murdered and			
Scobie in trying to investigate is uh laid up wrong making			
wrong decisions and ends his life ultimately in suicide 			
Uh Scobie also is a catholic and suicide is a sin by the			
catholic church 			
And here once again clearly you see the dichotomy the			
conflict between good and evil between belief faith and uh			
reason and the way Greene mixes these characters is			
absolutely masterly 			
Graham Greene undoubtedly is the most famous and highly respected			
English writer 			
In nineteen eighty-six he was appointed to the order of merit 			
In nineteen eighty-eight he received the British film			
institute award for his services to the cinema that he has not yet been			
awarded the nobel prize for literature is a puzzle to most people outside			
the British Academy 			
People have asked why hasn't he been given the nobel prize for			
literature the greatest award ?			
Well the answer I think is pretty simple 			
Uh Greene is essentially a story teller in the Mau			
 Somerset Maugham's tradition 			
Uh not one of his description really rises above straight			
writing 			
He hasn't got the turn up phrase 			
He is really a master craftsman only in as much that his			
writing is very constricted and there are no spare words that he uses 			
nothing embellished 			
And perhaps the people who decide on these things are more			
impressive with smart writing turn up phrase memorable description			
 or sometime the philosophy 			
As far as philosophy is concerned Graham Greene is far too			
subtle uh for people of who form the decision making body of the			
nobel prize committee 			
Hello viewers 			
All of us are interested in developing the ability to speak			
English fluently and expressively 			
But many of us are unnecessarily diffident about it 			
You will find that with a little guidance and constant			
effort it's possible to make remarkable improvement in the			
ability to speak English 			
The aim of this programme is to highlight some of those			
aspects of speech which contribute to better spoken English 			
I am sure all of us refer to a dictionary whenever we don't know			
the meaning of a word 			
But we quickly have a look at the meaning and then close the			
dictionary 			
There is one important bit of information which we generally			
don't use and that is pronunciation 			
Every good dictionary gives the pronunciation of a word 			
Whenever you refer to a dictionary you will find that			
immediately after the entry of the word its pronunciation or			
transcription is given in bracket 			
 Let's have a look at one such transcription given			
in the dictionary 			
This word is to be pronounced as agreement			
 			
Listen carefully agreement 			
We are aware that many of us say agreement			
 and this pronunciation seems to be influenced by spelling			
Look at the first symbol in this transcription 			
It is rather a strange letter because that doesn't appear 			
in the ordinary letters of the alphabet 			
That sta stands for the sound			
 IPA symbol the weak sound IPA symbol in English			
The next three symbols give us the sound gree			
 and the next four symbols give us the sound 			
 ment 			
If you put this together you get agreement			
 			
You will find that there are about fifteen such strange looking			
symbols used in most dictionaries 			
And it is a matter of a few minutes to get familiar with those			
symbols 			
You will find that once you know those symbols you will have			
the ability to read the correct pronunciation given in a dictionary			
Any dictionary gives a list of phonetic symbols right at			
the beginning 			
For example have a look at this table 			
In this table you find that on the left there are some			
symbols phonetic symbols as we call them 			
Towards the right there are some words which point out			
what are the sounds represented by those symbols 			
If you go through this carefully you will find that in			
fact you already know many of the symbols 			
As I said there are only a few symbols that you will have			
to try and remember 			
Let us move on to one important aspect of speech 			
As we all know there are vowel sounds and consonant sounds			
 Let's consider two important vowel sounds 			
First let's take up these words lip			
 leap 			
Listen carefully again to these two words lip			
 leap 			
You will find that there is difference in the vowel sound 			
of these two words 			
The first sound is a short sound the sound is i			
 			
The second one is a long sound i: and			
that gives you lip leap 			
Have a look at the next pair of words pull			
 pool 			
Listen again pull pool			
 			
The contrast is between short IPA symbol and long			
 IPA symbol 			
I would like to give you a simple hint 			
In case of short vowels try to make your vowels as short as			
possible 			
And in case of long vowels try to make them as long as you can			
This will help you retain the distinction between the short			
vowels and long vowels 			
 Let's briefly talk about some consonants which are			
problematic to many Indian users of English 			
 Let's have a look at the next pair of words 			
fan finish 			
Listen again fan finish			
 			
Many Indians have a problem in articulating the first sound			
Instead of saying fan they say			
 phan instead of saying finish 			
 they say phinish 			
Have a close look at my lips now 			
The English sound is fa fan			
 finish 			
And you will observe that there is a contact between the			
lower lip and the upper teeth 			
Please observe again fan 			
finish 			
In the Indian equivalent you will find that there is a contact			
between the two lips 			
Look carefully pha 			
Many Indians say phan 			
phinish instead they should say fan			
 and finish 			
 Let's have a look at the next pair of words 			
think and thank 			
Again note carefully the first sound 			
The first sound is IPA symbol and not 			
tha 			
Many Indians say think and thank			
 			
I hope you hear the difference between the English sound 			
and the Indian equivalent 			
Listen again to the difference 			
The English pronunciation IPA symbols the Indian			
pronunciation think the English pronunciation			
 IPA symbols the Indian pronunciation thank			
 			
What really happens in the articulation of the English sounds is			
 that the first sound in these words is a friction sound the air			
comes out between the lower and the upper teeth 			
Look again think thank 			
And if you are a little aware of how these sounds are produced			
 that will make a lot of difference to our spoken English 			
We have to take one important piece of care 			
Many of us are exposed to spelling first and then to			
pronunciation 			
This gives rise to what some people have described as			
spelling pronunciation 			
Look at the next three words on the screen 			
The first word is immediate 			
Some of you might wonder that this word has another possible			
pronunciation immediate 			
 That's right 			
Some words in English have two or more acceptable			
pronunciations 			
This word is either IPA symbols - immediate or IPA			
symbols - immediate but not IPA symbols - immediate 			
Many Indians think that because there is double m			
 in spelling there must be two IPA symbols sounds 			
And therefore they think that the pronunciation must be			
immediately 			
But let's remember that there is only one m			
 there and therefore the pronunciation is IPA symbols -			
immediate or IPA symbols - immediate 			
The next word is often pronounced by Indians as 			
ring 			
Listen again ring 			
But the British pronunciation would be IPA symbols - rin			
 			
The difference is in the last sound 			
In the British pronunciation there is no ga			
 at the end 			
 It's IPA symbols - ring and not IPA symbol -			
ring 			
Similarly in the next word it's not IPA			
symbols - ringing but IPA symbols - ringing 			
Again there is no ga 			
There is a tendency to go by spelling and this is one			
important piece of care that we'll have to take about			
English pronunciation 			
In the pronunciation that we showed you from the dictionary			
 there was one mark which I didn't explain earlier 			
Before g you must have seen a short			
vertical stroke on top of the word and you might have wondered 			
what it was 			
In fact that is called the accent mark or the stress mark			
Accent or stress is a very important feature of English speech			
 and it has been proved that that lead to intelligibility of English			
Between the correct articulation of vowels and consonants and			
the correct accent what is definitely more important is the right			
accent 			
And therefore all of us should be bothered about this feature			
 of English speech 			
You will find that in any dictionary the accent is			
indicated by certain kinds of strokes 			
Most of them use a short vertical stroke before the			
accented syllable 			
 Let's have a look at some of these words on the screen			
The first word is character 			
Now this word is made up of three syllables or three parts 			
 cha ric and ter			
 			
Remember that all these three parts are not said with equal			
emphasis 			
Listen again character and you will			
find that I am emphasising I am somehow highlighting the first			
part cha character 			
I must not pronounce the word as character or character			
 because this would be a shift in accent 			
It has been found out that English is often understood by			
the right accent 			
And there has been an experiment an interesting one where			
it was found that if Indians pronounce the word as character 			
English speakers heard the word as director 			
You might wonder why this happened 			
Look at the next word on the screen and you'll find			
 that that has accent on the second syllable 			
Therefore the English listeners thought that if the			
word character had accent on the second syllable it			
couldn't be that word 			
It has to be a word which has accent on the second syllable			
And therefore they thought of the nearest word which has			
accent on the second syllable 			
In the word director there is accent on the second syllable			
Again as I told you before this word has another possible			
pronunciation you might pronounce it as director 			
In whichever way you pronounce it the accent must be on the			
second syllable 			
 Let's have a look at the next word which is often			
mispronounced by Indians employee 			
There is accent on the third syllable neither on the first			
syllable nor on the second but on the third employee			
 			
Whereas many of us tend to say I am an employee of this			
institution 			
The correct pronunciation would be I am an employee of this			
organisation 			
The next word is an interesting case 			
All of us know this word and we know that this word			
functions as a noun an adjective or a verb 			
Depending on its grammatical role there is a change in accent			
When it is a noun or an adjective there is accent on the			
first syllable and therefore the pronunciation is present 			
When it is a verb the accent shifts to the second			
syllable and the pronunciation is present 			
 Let's try to use this in sentences 			
First of all the word present as a			
noun 			
He gave me a nice birthday present 			
The word as an adjective thirty students were present in the			
class yesterday 			
The word as a verb we are going to present a play tonight			
And I hope you have listened to the two different pronunciations			
 of the same word 			
The main difference was that of accent 			
In English there are a few words pairs of nouns and verbs			
 which behave in this particular way 			
If they are nouns there is usually accent on the first			
syllable and if they are verbs there is usually accent on the second			
syllable 			
 Let's consider one more example like this 			
The next word on the screen is both a noun and a verb 			
If it is a noun it can be pronounced as produce if it is			
a verb it should be pronounced as produce 			
And I hope you hear the difference in accent 			
 Let's use these words in sentences 			
The agricultural produce in India has gone up 			
India produces a lot of wheat 			
Therefore whenever we use words which can function either			
as nouns or verbs we should be careful about the accent 			
When we move from words to sentences there are certain			
problems 			
 Let's have a look at the next two sentences on the			
screen 			
Each sentence consists of a few words and many Indians try to			
give equal emphasis on each word 			
For example many Indians might read the first sentence like			
this my friend has finished the job 			
Whereas if you are a good speaker of English you might			
read it in some such way 			
My friend has finished the job 			
Listen again to the difference between the two 			
My friend has finished the job 			
And my friend has finished the job 			
In the English sentence properly said you will find that			
certain words stand out as more prominent 			
In this sentence the words that stand out as prominent are			
 friend finished and job 			
The words my has and the are relatively unimportant			
 and therefore you can speak them faster and more weakly 			
Listen to the sentence again My friend has finished			
the job 			
Consider the next sentence 			
 The machine is being repaired 			
Many Indians might read it as 			
 The machine is being repaired 			
Compare this with 			
 The machine is being repaired 			
Look at the first phrase the machine 			
Now you hardly hear the article the 			
I am not saying the machine but I am saying the			
machine the is relatively unimportant in			
this sentence 			
If you remember this simple fact that content words that			
is nouns adjectives adverbs and main verbs are usually more			
important than words like conjunctions articles auxiliary			
verbs 			
You will find that it will make a lot of difference to your speech			
 It's also necessary to have proper pauses at the			
right places 			
Because if you don't pause at the right place you will find			
that the sentence can convey a wrong meaning 			
Many of us are also aware of the necessity of using the right			
tone or the right intonation 			
 Let's have a look at the next two sentences 			
The first sentence She is beautiful 			
in a sense is not ambiguous 			
The word beautiful has one meaning here			
 but depending on the tone that you use in order to say this 			
it can convey different meanings 			
I am going to say this sentence in three different ways 			
and listen carefully to the difference 			
One She is beautiful 			
Two She is beautiful and three 			
 She is beautiful 			
I am sure you have heard the difference between the three			
sentences 			
And you'll find that all these three sentences said			
with three different tones convey three different meanings in English			
 Let's consider their meanings 			
Number one She is beautiful 			
This is a matter of fact statement 			
The speaker really appreciates the beauty of the person			
that he is talking about 			
But if he says it with a different tone as in number two 			
 She is beautiful you might perceive it as a			
question or you might think that the speaker wants to add something			
after this 			
This might convey the sense of incompleteness 			
Consider the third way of saying that She is			
beautiful 			
This in English indicates that there is some kind of implied			
meaning and that is left to the imagination of the listener 			
This sentence She is beautiful could			
mean okay she is beautiful but foolish or unreliable or			
something like that 			
So the praise the appreciation is not really unqualified			
There is some kind of implied meaning that the speaker is			
trying to convey 			
 Let's consider the next sentence 			
 Close the door 			
This sentence in isolation is a command 			
But if you use the right kind of tone this can be perceived			
as a request 			
Let me point out that there are different way of making			
requests in English 			
You can add words like please or kindly 			
You can change the sentence construction and say 			
Would you mind closing the door or May I ask a			
favour of you and then you ask the person to close the door			
 or a third possibility is to use the right tone 			
For example listen to the difference between these two			
sentences 			
 Close the door 			
 Close the door 			
The first sentence is perceived as a strong command whereas			
the second one is seen as a polite request 			
This indicates that intonation or tone plays a very important			
role in speech 			
A wrong intonation can sometimes convey wrong meaning 			
And this can cause a lot of misunderstanding 			
As we said at the beginning all of us would like to speak			
fluently and there is a common misunderstanding that fluency means			
fast speech 			
This is not really right 			
You can be slow in speed and yet be fluent because			
fluency depends on the kind of flow that your speech has 			
The speed must be controlled by what you are talking about and			
it is also directed it's also controlled by your personality 			
to some extent 			
Even if you take into account all these aspects of speech 			
which we have discussed there is one extremely important thing and			
that is confidence 			
Unless you feel self- confident you will not be able to make			
significant progress in spoken English 			
Of course your confidence must be supplemented by hard work			
and patience 			
At the end let's try to sum up the important			
aspects of speech to which we must pay attention 			
One the correct articulation of vowels and consonants 			
Two the right accent 			
Three the right kind of rhythm depending on accenting			
important words 			
And lastly intonation 			
As I said all these should be supplemented by confidence 			
and hard work 			
Thank you 			
Photogrammetry means making measurements on			
photographs 			
When direct measurements are not possible as in the case of			
 very intricate objects or moving objects we make 			
photograph and from that photograph we make measurements 			
Usually we take photograph from the air to make map of the			
topography 			
In this case the branch is known as aerial photogrammetry			
If the photographs are taken from the ground then the objects			
are surfaces are at a distance less than three hundred metres we			
call the branch as close range photogrammetry			
Where do we make use of close range photogrammetry in ?			
There are a number of applications 			
We can broadly divide these applications into two parts 			
The first part the objects will be static 			
For example historic monuments temple one word 			
 a train accident 			
In all these cases the objects on the surfaces are not			
moving they are all static 			
In the other case the object will be moving or the surface			
will be dynamic 			
To cite some specific example we can take the case of a			
wave form 			
When the waves are moving if you want to make measurement			
about the characterstics of the wave it is not possible to record the			
measurement directly 			
We take the photograph of this wave which are dynamic and			
later on we analyse the photograph to derive that information we desire			
To cite another example we can consider a running			
athlete 			
If you want to analyse the movement of the athlete it is			
difficult to make the measurement directly 			
We make use of close range photograph to record the movement of			
the athlete at various instance of time and later on from the photograph			
 we can analyse the movement of the particular sportsmen to find			
out their deficiencies 			
There are a number of applications of close range			
photogrammetry in the medical field 			
One such application is plastic surgery 			
For example if we want to make some alteration in any part			
of the human body we should know the present position of the particular			
part 			
We take photograph of that particular part by making use of			
 a special camera 			
The doctor can then simulate by making use of computer 			
how the particular part would look like after the surgery is made 			
The surgeon may decide how much of tissue should be taken 			
from another part of the body where the tissue should be placed and			
how it should be placed all these required measurement can be			
analysed by means of the photographs taken of the particular			
patient 			
Another interesting application is in recording crime			
scene and traffic accidents 			
Imagine the nature of the traffic in a very busy highway			
 when a traffic accident takes place 			
Immediately the vehicles pile up one after another for			
kilometres together if it is a very busy highway 			
We will normally wait till the police people come to make			
the necessary measurement and the signal from the police people 			
to clear the traffic it takes about half an hour or so to			
record all the measurements the police people need to present the			
case before the magistrate 			
Consider the delay in the movement of the traffic in this			
case to all the people who are waiting in their vehicles to clear the			
traffic 			
If you have here close range photogrammetry camera we can rush			
the camera to the traffic accident site record the scene by means of a			
few photographs taken from two or three vantage position 			
What all measurements we need about the traffic accident we			
can later on derive the same by analysing the photograph taken from			
the close range photogrammetry camera 			
Another area where close range photogrammetry would be			
more useful is in the recording of structural movement of			
massive structures 			
To cite a specific example we can consider a massive dam			
If we would like to know how much the dam is one word 			
 over a period of time or how much the dam is getting deflected over a			
period of time we can make use of this technique 			
We will make special target on the surface of the dam			
 at various points 			
We can record the dam site alongwith the target mark making use			
of the photogrammetry camera over a period of time 			
Normally we may take pictures at intervals of about a month			
If we analyse the photograph of the dam taken periodically			
 making use of special plotting machines we will come to know 			
how much that targets are getting moved either in the vertical direction			
 or in the lateral direction or in any direction of deformation 			
Because we will be taking measurement to a very high order of			
accuracy to about one by thousand of a milimetre we will be knowing			
how much the structure is getting deflected over a period of time 			
very very accurately 			
Same is the case when we want to record structural failure 			
For example if a beam is loaded by external load 			
gradually the beam will be deforming until the beam fails 			
If a structural engineer would like to record the behaviour of			
the structure due to various types of loading he can make use of the			
close range photogrammetry camera to record how the structure is			
getting deformed instant after instant 			
After the recording is done he can analyse the photograph 			
in the special photogrammetry plotting machine to find out their nature			
of deformation and the extent of deformation very very accurately			
Another field of application is the field of anthropology 			
The anthropologists are interested in classifying the skull			
 to find out to which race a particular skull belongs 			
The anthropologist will be recording the important dimensions			
of various skulls belonging to different races 			
There will be some characteristic measurements for a particular			
skull 			
If a skull is to be analysed we can take photograph of the skull			
 find out the characteristic of the important measurements and from			
the measurements we can find out whether the skull belongs to a			
Chinese or a Nepali or an Asian race 			
We need a number of equipment to produce map making use of			
the close range photogrammetry technique 			
The first equipment needed is an electronic distance measuring			
equipment 			
An electronic distance measuring equipment is known as E D M			
This is a sophisticated equipment to measure the distances 			
and angles 			
An infra range beam is generated in the E D M and			
it travels to the point to which you want to make measurement and it			
gets reflected back to the equipment 			
By analysing the face shift we can find out the distance between			
any two points to a high order of accuracy usually fractions of a			
milimetre 			
In the case of close range photogrammetry we establish a			
few control points as target in the field of view of the photograph 			
The E D M is made use of in the field to record the			
rectangular coordinate of the various control points 			
By analysing their distances and angles we will come to know			
 that X Y and either coordinate of the control point situated in			
the field of view 			
When we analyse this photograph in the plotting machine the			
control points are very essential 			
The coordinate of the control points which were obtained from			
the E D M are fit into the plotting machine 			
The second equipment needed for the close range photogrammetry			
 is a special stereometric camera 			
This camera essentially consists of two independent 			
highly accurate camera separated by a known distance of hundred and			
twenty centimetres 			
The lenses are having a focal length of sixty milimetres 			
A speciality of these two cameras is that the lenses have been			
so refined that practically no lense distortion occurs in the			
pictures taken from this camera 			
Since we will be making measurement on the photograph to a very			
high order of accuracy we have to have the images of the objects 			
positioned in the geometrically correct location 			
If there is need of specially refined lenses required for			
this stereometric camera we we should have two cameras instead of one in			
the case of close range photogrammetry 			
If we take twin pictures simultaneously we will be able to see			
their actual field in three dimensions in the plotting machine which we			
will be using later 			
Because the two photographs are taken simultaneously we are			
freezing the movement of the objects as well as we are able to get a			
three dimensional true to scale model in the photogrammetric plotting			
machine 			
This machine is so constructed to have simultaneous pictures			
If we operate a single button both the pictures are taken			
simultaneously 			
Because we will be taking measurement very very accurately this			
camera takes only glass plates 			
The glass plates are sensitized with the photogrammetric emulsion			
The emulsion are sensitive to the light and the processing			
which takes place after the exposure is made 			
During the development stage during the drive stage no			
distortion of the pictures occurs 			
Thats why we are making use of glass plates to arrest all			
distortions of the negative 			
Another special feature of this camera is the various			
possibility of orientation of the camera 			
If we need the shaft of the camera containing both the			
cameras can be rotated in the longitudinal axis or the camera			
can be brought one over the other 			
The camera can also be swivelled about the vertical axis 			
Why should we need all these types of movement ?			
We may need to take photograph from the high point such as the			
top of a mountain but the object may be far below 			
Once the photographic processing is over the original glass			
plates containing the emulsion are converted into the dipositives 			
In the plotting machine we keep the dipositives 			
one on the left side and one on the right side 			
We measure the coordinate of a particular point in the machine			
 through the binocular kept in front of the observer 			
The observer finds a fourteen mark in the field of			
view 			
He keeps the fourteen mark over a point of interest			
As he measures the coordinate of the point making use of the			
photogrammetric machine the computer controlled part takes the X and			
Y coordinate from the left image and the right image and they are			
processed through the computer to give the X Y and either coordinates			
 with respect to a given origin 			
The ground control points which are measured earlier they are			
also made use of to calculate the actual position of the point			
measured 			
The computer after recording all the photographic coordinates			
 converts them into graphic details 			
The graphic details are then passed on to a special plotting			
table 			
In the plotting table the plotting pencil according to the			
command of the observer converts the details of the scene into a			
picture 			
That picture may contain all the details appearing in the field			
of view in the form of live feature 			
The operator may choose special symbols and special colours			
 to codify the different types of features appearing in the field			
of view 			
A user by studying the map coming out from the plotting table			
 will be able to get all the measurements he needs without any			
difficulty 			
If the observer needs only the coordinate and not the map he			
can take all the required coordinate from the screen of the computer			
itself or if the operator would like to keep all the			
measurements in a magnetic tape or a floppy he can store all the			
information of the field and keep them in a special plate 			
If you would like to record the changes in a particular field over			
a period of time the same type of measurement can be repeated and			
from the repeated measurement it is possible to find out the changes			
which have occured in a particular field or a particular object 			
Concluding I would like to remark that whenever you have a			
situation where the direct measurements are not at all possible 			
the stereophotogrammetric technique will be coming handy to you 			
 Music 			
 Music this is the most essential factor in			
the very existence of man 			
But what is music ?			
Dictionary defines music as the art of			
expression in sound in harmony and melody 			
So music is not mere noise it is a series of melodious and			
harmonious sounds very pleasing to the ear 			
So melodious and harmonious sounds very pleasing to the ear			
 make music 			
These melodious sounds also have rhythm in it 			
Music must have been born even before the language 			
When man came into being on this earth he must have heard many			
melodious sounds around him The rippling sound of water 			
waves of sea chirping of birds rustling of leaves 			
all these sweet sounds probably gave him the knowledge of musical note			
He must have later on given names to these musical notes 			
Every human being is born with an ear for music and loves			
to sing singing 			
Little children illiterate adivasis village women and			
all those who sing but have never made a proper study of music are			
hardly aware that the sweet melodious sounds that they are producing 			
are composed of seven musical notes 			
Folk songs devotional songs film music gazal 			
thumri classical music even western music all these different			
types of music are composed of seven basic musical notes 			
Call them do re mi pha so la ti or			
 sa re ga ma pa dha ni 			
Whether it is Eastern music or Western music these seven			
musical notes are universally accepted 			
After the completion of these seven notes the second octave			
begins 			
Let us talk about Indian music sa re ga 			
ma pa dha ni are basic seven notes called			
 shudha swaras 			
There are five more notes in between these basic notes 			
called komal and tivra notes 			
Thus all music has these twelve basic notes 			
Let us take an example of a very popular but very simple			
 bhajan that every Indian can sing Raghupati			
Raghav Rajaram 			
How many of us know of what musical notes this simple			
 bhajan is composed of ?			
Let us see bhajan 			
Let us hear the same tune now on guitar guitar being			
played 			
The same musical notes are either vocally produced or they			
are played on the instrument to produce the same tune 			
It is indeed very interesting to know who created these musical			
notes 			
About the origin of music and the seven musical notes there			
are many stories all different stories in different countries 			
different languages and different religion 			
Hindus believe that Brahmadeva created music gave this			
art to Shankar who handed it over to Saraswati who is considered 			
as the goddess of fine arts 			
Later Narad did penance or tapascharya and			
received the art of music from Saraswati 			
Narad then taught music to Gandharvas Kinnaras and Apsaras			
Bharatmuni the great sage is responsible for bringing music			
on this earth 			
Even in the oldest of scriptures we find the mention of music			
According to one European story this world was originally			
created without music 			
This world was dry drab and very uninteresting 			
Man and woman were unhappy and could not make love in this			
atmosphere 			
So God created seven beautiful melodious musical notes to			
make this world enchanting and lovable 			
In Arabian history it is believed that music originated 			
from the bird bulbul 			
According to the African sage Ifari man and woman were			
bathing in a beautiful lake and their movements in the water created			
lovely sweet sounds 			
These melodious sounds created in the water are the origin of			
music 			
Well known musicologist Rinsobols also believed that			
musical notes have originated from melodious sounds created in			
the ripples of water 			
The Japanese scholar Shikoba says in his book that			
music is has originated in heaven not on			
this earth 			
When man and woman were created by the god they already had the			
knowledge of music 			
So music is always considered to be divine 			
The Western scholar Freud always believed that origin of			
music has its base in the psychology of human being sounds			
The sounds uttered by the child sounds 			
crying laughing shouting are learnt by the child			
itself 			
Nobody teaches the child to cry or to laugh 			
Similarly the musical notes are created by the man himself 			
when he was feeling happy and relaxed sound 			
Another Western historian says that man has created music 			
through his wisdom and intelligence 			
Man has always been searching different ways to entice the			
woman 			
So he has tried to attract her by creating different			
sweet melodious sounds and thus music came into being 			
Well known Indian scholar Damodar Pandit says that the seven			
notes of music are created by imitating the sounds of different birds			
and animals 			
The basic note sa is taken from peacock			
 re from chatak ga from			
sheep ma from kraunch or crane pa			
 from koel dha 			
from frog and ni from elephant 			
It is also believed that as seven colours are emitted by			
sunlight so the seven musical notes are emitted from Om			
 			
 Om is one letter word containing three			
letters a oo and ma 			
These three letters symbolise energy 			
 A symbolises creation or creator Brahma			
 Oo symbolises protector Vishnu and			
 Ma symbolises destroyer Mahesh 			
All these three energies together form the trinity or			
Trimurti Parameshwar 			
The basic original sound used in Vedas is Om			
 			
The vibration produced by the correct utterance of this word			
 Om are very very powerful and the correct			
utterance of Om can awaken the latent energy of the			
man 			
The seven musical notes emanate from this one letter word			
 Om 			
And the correct utterance and repeatedly utterance of			
 Om and the pursuit of Om can			
give the enlightenment of music 			
In Indian music the seven musical notes are called 			
Shadaja rishabha gandhar madhyam pancham dhaivat and			
nishad 			
Who gave these names to these seven musical notes is really a			
mystery 			
 Shadaja means creator of six notes 			
The vocal singer fixes his basic note sa			
 according to the capacity of his vocal cords and from this			
basic sa he gives the ascent in ascending order 			
the next six notes re ga ma pa dha 			
and ni 			
Before fixing the position of the seven notes one believed in			
twenty-two shrutis 			
Sounds useful to create music were first called 			
shrutis 			
From the twenty-two shrutis in one octave 			
seven were chosen and names were given to them 			
 Shadaja madhyam and pancham 			
 have four shrutis each nishad gandhar			
 have two shrutis each 			
 Rishabha and dhaivata have			
three shrutis each 			
During the vedic period only three musical notes were used			
 they were called udaatta anudaatta and 			
swaritta or prathama dwitiya and 			
tritiya 			
They were equivalent to gandhara rishabha 			
and shadaja 			
A little later one more note a little higher than these			
notes was used while chanting the Vedas 			
It was equivalent to madhyam 			
Later on three more notes equivalent to pancham 			
dhaivata and nishad were added 			
During Panini's time these seven shudhha			
 musical notes were already accepted 			
Later on five more notes were added 			
They were in between these seven notes 			
No new names were given to them but they were called 			
 re komal ga komal ma tivra dha komal and 			
ni komal 			
Thus these twelve music notes were accepted and all			
music is composed of these twelve musical notes 			
They are little lower or little higher than the shuddha			
 notes 			
So today we have these twelve basic musical notes 			
Music is normally composed of three octaves each containing			
twenty-two shrutis 			
The middle octave is called madhya saptak the			
lower octave is called mandra saptak and the higher			
octave is called tivra saptak 			
Different permutations and combinations of these musical notes 			
produce different moods different ragas different			
music all very pleasing to the ear 			
Musical notes are like flowers in a garden 			
Each flower has a different colour different aroma 			
different beauty and different splendour 			
Each flower is beautiful 			
One can choose different flowers from this garden of musical notes			
 and form thousands of varieties of beautiful bouquets 			
This music bestows upon the human mind the heavenly bliss 			
and creates a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere for which the human			
being strives music 			
In the last programme we had seen four basic consumer			
rights right to safety right to information right to choose			
 and right to redressal their concepts and connotations 			
In this programme we propose to concentrate on 			
consumers' right to safety which is the most paramount of all			
consumer rights 			
Now when we think of consumer safety where wide range			
of goods and services to which the consumers are exposed in			
relation to health hazard or even for that matter life and death 			
Take a small item like detergents and drinking water 			
If the drinking water is not wholesome and potable and free			
from germs and bacteria there are cases where the people run			
into cholera or gastroentitis and succumb to death 			
We had the situation last year in Ahmedabad where three hundred			
and fifty people died on that account 			
Take uh detergent 			
We do not realise but it's the poor or unsafe quality			
of detergent adversely affect the human skin and it also			
affects the life of the garment 			
Now take the larger cases of uh aircrash where all			
the passengers flying by the plane might die 			
Or take the still worse running out of the hazardous			
chemical industry 			
The most known example could be of the Bhopal gas tragedy			
 where three thousand five hundred people are report to 			
 reported to have been dead because of the leak of M			
I S 			
Now therefore in this context it becomes very relevant as			
to how the consumers can and should protect both their health			
 as well as life 			
Now here when we begin with the story we should look			
at some of the other items of domestic or day to day use 			
Take for example domestic gas cylinder 			
There are cases where the gas cylinders are exploded and			
resulting into death of the house wives and sometimes with even 			
the babes in their arms 			
Take other areas Domestic electrical appliances			
 			
These are of day to day use and there are cases of			
electrocution that because of some defect somewhere person gets a			
shock and he gets killed 			
Now take the other situations where uh the hazardous			
chemicals are involved 			
When because of fire explosion leakage or spillage			
 the people in the neighbourhood so far the factories are concerned			
Or people travelling on the highway when transportation of			
hazardous chemicals is involved 			
Or people living in far away distances where the hazardous			
chemicals are stored for marketing or distribution and something goes			
wrong 			
Or take another area housing 			
If the housing is not properly designed and the construction or			
 workmanship are not of proper order then they result into 			
unsafe housing 			
Apart from the most obvious one like the collapse of the house			
 there are more subtle forms of safety like from the 			
 fl from the uhm floors above you if			
the water or the fluid from the sanitary blocks latrines or			
urinals begin to uh drip or begins to uh percolate then that			
leads to a different kind of health hazard arising out of dampness 			
and arising out of the discharge 			
Now more obvious known cases of safety of housing happen to be			
 one where because of either the poor workmanship or a bad design 			
where a part or whole of the house collapses and as a result of which			
large number of people can die and do die 			
And this kind of things we have to see even more often in case			
of public buildings or public works like bridges dams and things of			
that kind 			
So therefore the question that arises is that if this is the			
 manner in which the consumers are exposed so far as their health			
 and safety are concerned how does one go about it 			
Now one can talk of some measures that the consumers can take 			
For example if you are using a hair dye you should ensure			
to see that the chemicals used therein are not likely to cause			
cancer 			
Or if you take the examples of domestic electrical appliances 			
whether do they carry I S I mark given by bureau of Indian			
standards in the country 			
Or if you look at the detergents whether they happen to be			
of a good quality and as a result of which neither the skin nor			
the life of the garments are likely to be affected 			
So there are some areas where the consumers themselves can			
take care in both ways either in terms of the following the			
instructions that are given for the use of these products or 			
even before buying the products one can take certain measures to see that			
 they do not run into unsafe goods 			
There is another area of consumer safety namely the			
adulteration of food 			
And there are cases reported time and again in the news papers 			
where because of the food poisoning people tend to die or run into far			
more serious physical ailments 			
There are also very subtle kinds of cases where there are			
some articles or some components in the food to which certain people			
might be alergic and as a result of which they tend to suffer a great			
deal 			
Take another area for example medicine 			
Now ordinarily all of us understand that medicine is supposed			
to help us in terms of the treatment from which we might suffer 			
But there are two kinds of serious problems with medicine 			
Take those medicines which are available across the counter			
 without doctor's prescription 			
So in a sense the patient becomes a doctor and 			
when these medicines are purchased across the counter the concern is 			
how much information the patient has and is he able to take care 			
when he uses those medicines as such 			
You must have seen the reports of couple of years back when			
because of the adulterated or toxic substances in the glucose saline 			
about fourteen children died in Bombay 			
Now some of the medicines across the counter which look			
very innocent they themselves can become hazardous in respect of			
certain categories of patients like children pregnant women or			
aged people suffering from blood pressure or heart trouble 			
So therefore uh even the medicine which normally supposed			
to help us can cause this kind of health hazards or the problems of			
safety 			
Now let us take some areas where you are not able to			
immediately connect the use of the product or the existance of the			
product with the safety 			
Take for example asbestos 			
Now the people who have been working in the asbestos factory 			
there has been situations where after five years of the retirement or ten			
years of the retirement the disease of asbestos comes on the surface 			
and by that time they might have not only left the factory but they might			
have left even the city where they were working and might have gone to			
their respective villages and they are not able to connect that this			
particular health hazard has a reason because of their exposure 			
to the factory where they worked 			
Not only that even the people who happen to come in contact			
with the workers they carry those fibres from them 			
Even take the consumers for examples where the asbestos 			
material is used either for insulation partition uh or 			
roofing or piping and all that and in the course of time they			
disintegrate and they affect the consumers as well 			
And this is such a slow process that it may take place after			
six months after five years or fifteen years and one is not able to			
realise the cause - effect relationship as such 			
Take another example namely the disposal of toxic waste or			
disposal of uh chemical effluents 			
They might take place in one city and the effect on the			
 underground water in the wells or in the springs might be			
found thirty forty miles away from the place where they were discharged			
Or the toxic waste might have been dumped today and may be			
after fifteen years some disintegration takes place and the ground			
water gets affected 			
So therefore you can see now from the various examples and 			
kinds of situations that I have described that the area of consumer			
safety is so wide and so large that one has to be extremely careful or			
cautious in ones own life 			
Now there obviously will be a question that all this is			
fine but what can be done 			
Now there are number of things that can be done and one can only			
illustrate as to how far you can succeed in getting things done 			
Say for example take domestic electrical appliances and some			
of the items that we use in our homes day to day 			
Because of the public opinion pressure ultimately the			
government of India came forward and they not only made the I S I			
standards compulsory uh I S I standards mandatory for these			
domestic electrical appliances but now in respect of some items for the			
country as a whole even the certification by I S I now called B I			
S has been made compulsory and those items happen to be like 			
these electric irons emersion heaters radiators uh then take 			
a the switches two pin and three pin plugs 			
Now those about eight items for which no 			
 not only the B I S standards are mandatory but even			
certification has been made compulsory which means that unless			
these items carry I S I certification mark they cannot be sold in the			
country 			
Now at least one thing that I S I certification assures you is			
 that if the certification is done rightly at least they are safe			
products 			
They may or may not be of extraordinarily high quality but			
certainly they give you an assurance that they are the safe products 			
If by chance some manufacturer though he is carrying an I S			
I mark but those products don't confirm to I S I standard then his			
liability becomes much bigger 			
And in any case Bureau of Indian Standards helps you in			
respect of dealing with that kind of situation either in terms of			
replacement of goods or any other remedy that may become available 			
Uh in case of Gujarat the state has gone even a step further			
 that all those faulty electrical appliances for which I S I			
standards were made mandatory way back in nineteen seventy-six and			
further amended in nineteen eighty-one all those appliances now are			
required to carry an I S I certification mark before they are being sold			
or marketed marketed in Gujarat 			
Uh one option is given that either they carry I S I			
certification mark or they carry a certification mark provided by			
chief electrical engineer 			
So this is one measure where the consumers can feel reassured			
that if they use the I S I certificated marks electrical goods in the			
home or appliances in the home they may be reasonably safe 			
Another example that I want to you give is very interesting one 			
uh but is a foreign one where again it deals with the drugs 			
This happened in United States and particularly in the state of			
California 			
Uh somewhere around nineteen seventy-one or meaning around that			
decade a drug was introduced in the market uh in the short words it			
was called des D E S and its full name is Dyfile Solbitrol 			
Now this particular brand of medicine was introduced in the			
market to help pregnant women to avoid miscarriage or abortion 			
The drug was found to be effective so far as prevention of			
miscarriage or abortion was concerned 			
But it had an unusual kind of an fact not on the			
pregnant women who took the medicine but of the daughters born of			
those pregnancies and that too after the daughters reached the age			
of puberty between fourteen and eighteen 			
And those daughters were found to suffer from cancer and an			
interesting question of law arose that whether these daughters born			
of these pregnancies have a remedy against the pharmaceutical			
companies 			
You can imagine the difficulty involved that the daughters who			
are the victims are not are not the consumers			
of the medicine 			
And their mothers had consumed this medicine before fifteen			
twenty years when they were in their mothers wombs 			
And the matter went to the Califor 			
California state supreme court and the court found a			
solution to this problem since this medicine des was			
manufactured and marketed by a large number of pharamceutical companies			
 so what the court did was that court asserting the total sale of			
the medicine and in this way total market for this medicine how			
much was the share or the market share of each of this particular			
products by each of the pharmaceutical companies and depending upon the			
market share of the pharmaceutical company for this particular drug 			
during seventies the court awarded a total damage let us say may			
be a million dollars or half a million dollars 			
And and then the court said on the principles of			
apportionment linked with the market share as to how much money shall			
be paid by each of the pharmaceutical company to these daughters who			
had suffered from cancer because of the adverse effect of this medicine			
As for a statistical information I can tell you that there are			
about one thousand such suits filed in the U S courts 			
Now of course this particular drug has been withdrawn from the			
market 			
So what one would like to look at or look back and see that			
there are preventive measures which can be taken by the consumers and or			
the authorities concerned at the same time in the unfortunate			
event of loss or injury sustained by the consumers there are remedies			
available 			
And American example goes to a large extreme or a large			
unusual kind of condition where one is not able to prove the			
cause effect relationship between the particular product and its			
consequence and yet the victims were able to recover substantial			
amount of damages from the pharmaceutical companies 			
Let us now come to the Indian scene 			
If on account of use or consumption of any unsafe goods or			
 unsafe services of which I gave a number of illustrations or examples			
If the consumer suffers loss or injury what remedies are			
available to him ?			
Under the Consumer Protection Act of nineteen eighty-six 			
three tier quasi judicial machinery is being set up consumer			
grievence disputes redressal district forum state commission and			
national commission 			
Now if the consumer is able to prove that the loss or			
injury suffered by him on account of unsafe goods or unsafe services 			
was on account of the negligence of the people who provided the			
goods or services the consumer will be able to claim damages in			
respect of loss or injuries suffered by him 			
So therefore this new machinery not only provide the remedy			
 but that remedy is likely to be most inexpensive and least time			
consumings because they are starting on a clean slate and they are			
specialised tribunals 			
Reproduction is essential for continuation of species in nature			
For this to occur sperm a male gamete and the ovum the			
female gamete are necessary 			
A proper understanding of a male reproductive system is			
essential to understand the intricate mechanisms of nature 			
The male reproductive system provides for the production and			
subsequent delivery of a highly specialised male gamete called sperm			
 which is produced in the testies 			
 The ca the cell consists of			
paternal genes and this genetic complement is transferred to the			
female gamete during the act of fertilisation 			
To facilitate the essential function a male reproductive			
system forms a complet complete structure			
The organisation of the male reproductive system comprises a			
pair of testes epididemus vasaeference a complex array of			
accessory male genetic glands penis 			
In many animals the testes is a scrotal imposition just as			
in the case of man 			
But in some species testes occupy abdominal positions 			
There are wide spectrum of variation in the location of the testes			
The position of the testes in different groups of mamal shows			
enormous variation in terms of its location 			
For example in the case of elephant higher access the			
testes lies just behind the kidney 			
In the case of hedgehog and some other insectivores the			
testes is located against the ventral abdominal wall 			
In the case of pigs rats horses rabbits dogs			
and cats the position of the testes is in non pendulum scrotum is			
underneath the anus 			
In dolphins armedillos cavity slogs the testes is			
located at posterior end of abdomen 			
In the case of moults shoos and some species of birds the			
testes is located at the base of the tail 			
In sheep cattle and other ruminants also in some primates			
 the scrotum is pendulous 			
The typical male reproductive system consists of pair testes			
 which may be located in the scrotum or may be present in the abdomen			
The testes are uh provided with a thick fibres cover 			
called tunica alveginia 			
The testes is divided into many compartments and consists of			
many coil tibules which are called as semeniferous tibules 			
In between seminiferous tibules lie special type of cells 			
which are called as interstitial cells or the cells of leddes 			
The semeniferous tibules in a section consists of large			
number of cell types 			
Basically these cell types are two the germs cells and			
the cells of sattory 			
The germs cells are concerned with the production of spermatozoa			
 while the cells of sattory basically have the nutritive function 			
If the cross section of the semeniferous tibule is examined 			
one would find the upper pair of cells to be spermatogonia 			
These themselves are of several types 			
They have been classified into spermatogonia of the a b and			
intermediate type 			
Even the a and b type of spermatogonia are of several subtypes			
 which are classified on the basis of their cytological			
characteristics 			
The first generation of primary spermatocites cells these			
undergo myosis 			
The myosis itself is of two types reduction division where			
a number of chromosomes is reduced to half and myosis two which is an			
equational division where there is an increase in the number of cells 			
unaccompanied by further reduction in the number of chromosomes 			
A primary spermatocites give rise to secondary spermatocites 			
which I have n number of chromosomes and are therefore called as haploid			
cells 			
The secondary spermatocites grow into round spermatics 			
These spermatics undergo a process of differentiation which			
is called as spermeogenesis 			
There are essentially four basic steps in this process one is			
called as gorgie followed by a cap phase and agrosome phase and a			
maturation phase 			
The spermatozoa which are derive from spermatics are			
highly organised cells 			
From a genetic point of view these sperms are half cells			
because they contain haploid or half the number of chromosomes 			
If you take the example of human the deployed number for			
dual number chromosomes is forty-six 			
At the end of spermatogenesis therefore the sperm contains 			
twenty-three chromosomes 			
These sperms may contain either x chromosome or y and			
genetically therefore they are dimorphic 			
This text just enumerated above describe a typical structure of			
the seminiferous epithilium 			
However this should be understood that the cells present			
in the seminiferous epithilium are in a stage of progressive development			
All seminiferous epithilium cells do not show the same 			
associations 			
That is that the arrangement of cells in each seminiferous			
tibules is different 			
Sometimes a large variety of cells can be seen in			
successive stages of development 			
The cell association is the term used to describe the			
arrangement of cells that is spermatogonia the primary spermatocites 			
despermatates and the differentiation process that is seen in the			
process of sperm formation 			
In the case of man there are six cell associations and fourteen			
different cell types have been identified 			
The cycle of development in the seminiferous epithilium 			
which leads to the formation of a completely differentiated sperm is			
called as sex cycle of the seminiferous epithilium 			
It takes about seventy-four days for a sperm to be derived from			
 the spermatogonia 			
The sperm formed in the testes are incapable of 			
fertilization and therefore they have to be uh they			
have to transit through o other 			
parts of the reproductive system particularly the epididamus 			
The root of spermatozoa is quite definite 			
From the testes they go into the retitestes and from where they			
go through a small ducts which are called as vasaefeverence 			
The vasaeference lead these sperms into the epididamus 			
The epididamus itself consists of three main parts 			
The top part which sits as a cap on the testes is called as			
cafort epididamus 			
The second part which forms the main body of epididamus is called			
as corpus and the terminal or tail part of the epididamus is called			
as corder 			
During their transit from cafort to corpus and finally to			
corder this sperm undergo vast and complex maturational changes 			
It can rightly be said that the epididamus is the main point			
 where the sperm undergo morphological biochemical and physiological			
changes which endorsed and the property of fertilizing the egg			
The sperm principally uh undergo changes in their			
membrane property in the maturation of uh the acrosome in the			
 uh ability to be more motile as they come into the corder 			
It has also been seen that the sperms on the cafort are			
incapable of fertilizing the egg and at best the rate of			
fertilization is about five percent 			
Corpus sperm usually are better about twenty percent but by the			
time they reach the corder epididamus they their fertilizing potential is			
about ninety-five percent 			
From the corder they are transported to vasaeference 			
and from there they are mixed with secretions of the essentially male			
genetic glands the prostate the seminal cycles the valbo electral			
glands also called as scoupers and some other minor glands which are			
found in some species but not in others 			
The mamalian spermatozoa is a highly differentiated cell 			
The typical mamalian spermatozoa consists of three main parts			
The head the mid piece and the tail 			
The head is not itself a simple structure 			
It contains on its interior aspect a structure which is called			
as acrosome 			
 The under the acrosome lies the nucleus which			
takes on the same shape as the head itself 			
The second part of the sperm is called as the mid piece 			
which contains the powerhouse of the cell called mitochondria 			
These mitochondria helically arranged and contains the			
necessary enzymes which can use the nutrients of the seminal fluid 			
for maintaining the integrity and functional abilities of the sperm 			
The acrosome itself contains three different types of enzymes			
 which are used in the process of fertilization 			
The tail consists of three main parts 			
The principal piece the end piece and a place where			
the mid piece joins the tail 			
The tail structure consists of two central filaments and nine			
peripheral filaments 			
The shape of this spermatozoa is very variable in the animals			
The number of sperms produced is also highly variable 			
For instance in the case of humans the number of sperms			
produced in one ejaculate is of the order of two hundred to four hundred			
million 			
The physiological function of the testes depend on a			
complex interplay of not only environmental factors but also on endocrine			
secretions 			
In principle extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors are			
involved with the stimulation of the nervous system 			
A part of the nervous system called hypothalamus contains			
special type of nerve cells which are called as neurosecretary cells 			
These cells secrete hormone which is called as 			
gonadotropin releasing hormone 			
These hormones can be transported to the pituitry by a			
vascular root or thorugh nural connections and it stimulate cells of the			
pituitry which in turn produces two types of hormones F S H and			
L H 			
The F S H act from the seminiferous epithilium and brings about			
 the development and differentiation of various egg cell types namely 			
from spermatogonia to spermatocites of primary and secondary type to			
spermatits and the formation of a differentiated sperm by spermatogenesis			
The F S H also acts on the certoli cells which are the nongerminal			
elements and these in turn secrete certain proteins which bind with			
the androgene produced in the ladic cells 			
Such bound androgene proteins androgene bound			
proteins hormones are again carried to the testicular			
germinal epithelium where they bring about sustenance of			
spermatogenesis 			
The second hormone which is produced from the pituitry is called as			
L H 			
But in the case of male it is called as interstitial cell			
stimulating hormone 			
This hormone acts on ladic cells of the testes and 			
 cau causes the release of androgene 			
Androgene are important for large number of functions 			
For instance androgene which are bound to androgene binding			
protein produce certoli cells are important for spermatogenesis 			
Androgene are also important for accessory male genetic gland			
functions 			
Androgenes are also involved with the development and			
differentiation of secondary sex characteristics and they are also			
concerned with libido and sexual behaviour in the case of animals 			
In many animals the these events of endocrine secretions			
occur cyclically 			
For instance there are many animals in which these phenomena			
occurs only once a year 			
In others where this events may occur twice a year or in			
still others this event may occur several times in a year 			
In the case of man the process of spermatogenesis once it has			
started continues for a very long period of time to the age of			
seventy or even eighty years 			
However the limiting factors in the start of reproductive			
activities in the endocrine elements as well as in the testicular and			
ladic cells depends on the attainment of puberty which are complex			
sexual maturational changes that are time dependent 			
In the case of human male they begin to occur at the age			
of fifteen years 			
The testicular spermatozoa thus produced find a way into 			
the epididamus where sperms undergo maturational changes 			
described above as well as they transit into the vasaeference			
 			
The flow of sperms from epididamus to the vaseeference is			
partly by hydrostatic pressure as well as by peristaltic motion 			
From vaseeference the sperms are mixed with the seminal			
secretions contributed by the accessory male genetic glands 			
They come into the urethra and uh the terminal part of			
the urethra is the penis 			
This penis is of two main types 			
In the case of humans the penis is described as a vascular			
type 			
Because the erection of the penis depends on congestion of			
blood 			
There are two main mechanisms for this erection 			
One is reflexogenic by spinal stimulation and the other is			
 by vasocongestion 			
The vasocongestion in this case may be psychogenic in 			
in the case of man 			
The second type of penis which is found in dogs and many other			
carnivores is called as the vibroelastic type 			
For copulation the sperms are deposited in female genital			
tract 			
The sperm uh with the seminal fluid constitute the semen			
This has an alcaline ph 			
The place where the sperms are deposited also shows variation 			
In the case of humans the sperms are deposited in the vagina			
 but in the animals like horses and others the sperms are deposited in the			
uterus 			
Irrespective of the site of deposition the millions of sperms			
 face very hostile environment in the vagina and in the cervix 			
The ninety-nine percent of the sperms or even more are			
destroyed 			
In the case of human female the sperms are able to reach the			
felopian tube where the egg awaits them and nearly one thousands to three			
thousands such sperms may surround the egg 			
Of these only one will one fuse with the egg and this			
ensures the beginning of a new life 			
If you want me to talk on uh Yakshagana			
 			
I can only talk on things that I have concerned myself with 			
 Yakshagana is an art form 			
I have been very much interested in popular folk art as			
well as the theatrical art of Karnataka 			
That means the commercial theatre with their 			
music-cum-prose scenery and spectacular elements on the stage 			
As a student as a youth we had so many of the theatrical			
companies 			
I was exposed to them 			
I had a fancy for these things 			
Later on I had impressions of the Maharashtra theatre			
 its music its social place and all that 			
Here one particular element interested me is this 			
you speak prose you get angry and then you sing a song 			
The same substance is carried the same object is carried			
through two different mediums 			
In dance you do foot work you sing you gesturise 			
and so many things 			
This put me into the problem 			
What can each do ?			
What can prose do ?			
What can music do ?			
What can dance do ?			
And what can they not do ?			
Therefore for a quite a number of years I experimented in			
pure prose plays pure mime plays pure musicals pure folk			
musicals and so on 			
With this element I began to tackle the Yakshagana			
theatre as such 			
For I felt it was very very rich in music 			
In the sense the words that they speak out in music is			
so rich and totally relevated relevant 			
to the subject matter 			
What does not appeal to me is the cleverness of the display of a			
 raga or a tala or any technical element 			
Just as grammar is not literature so technique is not art			
Technique is meant for a purpose 			
You use it for giving it a shape to your emotions 			
Here what are the emotions in Yakshgana ?			
What are the topics ?			
When it comes to the question of tapic topic 			
 you know we are taking Mahabharata plays			
We are not concerned with Karna or Kaurava or or any			
 rakshasa any saint 			
We are common people our experience for 			
So naturally you have to imagine these characters from how do			
they think 			
So how do you dress them ?			
Do you bring them in your modern day suit or something else ?			
In that way Yakshagana had one of the very			
richest element from nineteen thirty onwards 			
And many European scholars come and see the costume and make up			
 of Yakshagana 			
It was so interesting 			
Even in those days there were old people who could give			
 show any rakshasa chara 			
 character in a different type and valourous			
character in a different type and common people in common dress 			
This was the element that attracted them that attracted me too			
 on the stage 			
But at the same time I felt so many things jarring 			
There are the female characters 			
Say in a play Satyabhama and Rukmini come or			
 Panchvati play the Seeta comes 			
Seeta comes in an ordinary dress along with Rama coming in a			
different old time costume 			
This disharmony again disturbed me 			
It is not only that there were so many other questions raised			
We have got musical instruments 			
There is the drum there is the Bhagwat and there is the			
dance 			
Bhagwat is there narrating the story in so many ragas			
 and beautifully written songs 			
But sitting down on the stage can you make sense out 			
of even one word that he sings 			
He shouts he screeches and to outwit him there is the			
Himmela 			
The Himmela in most of our dancers are Mummela they dictate			
terms to a dancer they do not follow him 			
So naturally what happens is you don't even hear a single word			
of the Bhagwat 			
You hea hear him screeching 			
and you hear the drum play and all these things 			
This irrelevence with enough material of our own enough			
 ragas enough instruments enough judgement what is wrong			
with us ?			
We have begun to admire technique cleverness for its sake 			
shrieking for its sake the drum beating for its sake not for			
application of these things to give one word I want			
You want me to talk why ?			
To show that I am clever in talking that I can use bombastic words			
 or to show that I have something to say about the proposed subject			
Yakshagana 			
That means reference of the content the form is every thing in			
art 			
By itself things may be beautiful but you are using certain			
things to project to communicate a story of the Mahabharata			
 and all these things 			
Naturally when we take these things when you come on the stage			
with uh a monstrous character a Ravana and other characters and			
if you bring in Seeta in ordinary dress I should feel that he has stolen the			
 girl from the audience there and she doesn't form ?			
Similarly in costume 			
In old costume they strict some great man created the			
rakshasa costumes and these so many beautiful things in terms of colour			
In terms of painting some clever fellow did it 			
There is a harmony between what colours they have chosen 			
It doesn't the belong to the type of uh thinking as in			
Kerala the satvik rajsik and tamsik forms			
Colour harmony is a different element			
Combination of light elements pigment elements and 			
on that basis they have done super work so far as many characters			
are concerned 			
But no costume no ornament for the lady character 			
The lady character brings the is brought 			
 to be coquettish and woo the audience 			
She may be the Seeta in talk and these things you are the			
men audiences to be wooed by shiny or very cinema like fans on			
the screen so they begin to come with the most beautiful gaudy 			
with make-up powder lipsticks and any silk			
Now today you have got glaring dresses of any sort you			
begin to wear it 			
In Kathakali we've got a fine breast plate you			
have got a heap of beads on it 			
Why do you want the breast plate ?			
That means you have lost the eye for judging ornaments and			
colour harmony in costume itself in dress one word 			
Our Yakshagana dresses I have got certain things like this over			
 a grey or red jacket one is complementary to the other in terms			
of colour harmony 			
Then you put garlands you put beads and glass tubes			
and then if somebody presents a a jasmine you put that also more			
the merrier 			
Absolutely there is no sense of the stage colour harmony			
A stage is a painting where characters have to stand in			
respective places 			
Each man has to balance somebody else forward backward in			
terms of colour in terms of form in terms of emotion 			
Suppose you have got the Pandavas sculptured out by a a			
great Chola artist how would he make them stand one another not			
figures like this not presenting the characters in a form that all			
the forms blend together 			
An artist like Rodan in building the hell Gates of Paradise 			
brings in a hundred forms one is harmonious to the other			
So the stage has to be conceived in terms of people who is			
there			
I drive away the musician there 			
I don't want the musicians behind to distort the shape of			
the beautiful characters 			
They may be very important but their music could be heard 			
So these are the elements form and content in terms of music			
and these things 			
One big thing came to me is you take the raga 			
and the tala elements your beat you are very perfect you are			
great artist in training you never go wrong 			
But do you sing the same thing ?			
I remember one day a play like a a gypsy comes and			
asks Seeta did you see Ravana ?			
No I have not seen him I might have seen his leg 			
Alright draw a picture of the leg 			
Then she completes and makes it a Ravana and Rama comes he			
says you are still unfaithful you are still dreaming of Ravana 			
Then the punishment 			
Summary is Laxman take her and chop her head off 			
She is taken most pathetic situation the drum beating Chandi is			
as if you are taking a number of sheep to the Kali temple 			
This is what happens in every thing 			
In every classical form you see thai thak thai thai thak			
thai thai thak thai and the song is shringara 			
Is it shringara ?			
It is terrific shringara then 			
This is what made me think how to sing ?			
How to dance ?			
This is the step work maybe same tala 			
She is in a sorrow position wailing all through how does			
she present herself 			
We confine tala rhythm to the leg 			
Emotion is a body element there is the child that can get			
angry joyful every element of the body is seen 			
Leg and tala is not confined to the legs alone			
 to every moment of the rhythm 			
The whole body has to respond to an emotion 			
So in a greater sense you mean to say what is more effective on			
the stage in terms of voice in terms of so many things 			
Is there no individuality ?			
Have you to repeat it ?			
Then there are so many things on the stage which we think of			
 where emotions are strife 			
All Yakshagana plays are epical plays Mahabharata			
 plays or conflicts of emotion 			
They can give you a full range of things on the stage if you			
want to do it if you want to feel it 			
But how would you do it ?			
Our guru taught us like this to hold the hands			
and go like that 			
The guru seems to be a ghost for chasing			
people and artists to the length of her entire transformation of			
souls 			
You are there to feel as an actor evoke what best is there			
What best do you give ?			
Now I take it a question that is posed to Yakshagana			
 and our music also 			
Our music is in Yakshagana			
 may be classical music 			
Why do you sing ?			
Does it contain words ?			
For what was it created ?			
What are the words ?			
The words say something your tala says			
something your raga says that you are very clever you			
can sing for half an hour or even one hour a raga 			
But what is the word that you say ?			
This is everything I can uh there is a Hindustani song			
 who is as great as Rama 			
The word is aiso koudara jagamai in			
the whole world 			
There is none to beat Rama 			
Why ?			
Because whatever greatness blessing they wanted to know these			
people for years together prayed Rama 			
Without praising anything doing anything he blessed the 			
Vaccha Jatayu he blessed the Kubja 			
So there is none like Rama 			
If I say the word aiso koudar jagamaai in the			
whole world koudar it's acclamation in sound			
 jagamaai 			
Why ?			
 Vinuseva jodravaidinapara vinuseva jodravaidinapara			
Ramasarisakonahi koudar 			
Every good composition was a reflection of a thought from a saint			
or somebody else 			
Similarly Yakshagana songs or every song is a reflection			
of an emotion 			
How do you mouth it ?			
Yakshagana is very heroic 			
I thump the beat and I show that I am very rigorous 			
Are you heroic even in death even in pathos ?			
Means even if before your child dies there 			
It should make sense 			
In which case Yakshagana is an element 			
I think to me it is greater than classical element 			
For this one thing classical music was written by Savants			
 who were mostly saints mostly saints 			
They were reclusers 			
They were sorry for the birth of man			
They were sorry for any anything everything			
 			
So they used to either sing the praise of the Lord or say O			
Lord why did you bring me to earth 			
But a drama contains ever so many other emotions joy valour			
jealousy and all these things			
It must lend them 			
It is there 			
I can I end end end my short talk			
by giving one note of the Yakshagana song 			
In the battle after the third battle third day Duryodhana			
begins to weep 			
We have lost all rounds O Dronacharya where is the hope			
for us 			
There is no hope 			
Because the great demon killer Krishana is 			
Arjuna's charioteer 			
The man whom I had trusted Vidura has given away and gone away			
The great commander my grandfather Bheeshma is lying on a bed			
of arrows 			
What shall I do ?			
Now I will give you the Kannada word yena madali nanu			
 ?			
What shall I do ?			
For what purpose ?			
To defeat the Pandavas Pandavara solipade 			
Why ?			
 Danava takanavanu avage sarathiya agianu 			
The great demon killer Krishna is a charioteer for Arjuna			
Then my friend Vidura broke his bow went away			
Then Bheeshma is lying there almost dead 			
What shall I do ?			
This mood for an actor can come in ten different ways 			
It depends upon his liking of somebody else his hatred or			
jealous his despondency his sorrow for this sake Yena			
madali nanu pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade			
Yena madali nanu pandavara solipade Danavantak-navage sarathiya			
agianu 			
Ten different moods can be depicted			
Do you beat your drum to suit the mood or anything 			
So we can build up a great art even today we have got enough			
material from the past			
Why our tradition to be preserved is though we have not			
used it sensibly			
We have enough materials 			
In music we have a thousand ragas 			
How many emotions have I given expression to 			
Sometimes we are perverse we are praying Vinayak			
In what manner ?			
 Vatapi Ganapatim bhajihum va 			
You are clapping Ganapati it is a praise 			
This perversion why does it happen ?			
You are a votary of grammar thinking grammar is art 			
Grammar is that art 			
It is this way we can do a lot and a lot can be done to			
preserve or show the greatness of our own art 			
Showing by our skill about art is totally different 			
You can admire me you can admire anybody 			
But show the potentiality of the Indian art how it relates to			
the expression of the human urge in ways of art I think I have bored you			
enough 			
To most of us the term map is quite			
familiar 			
But still we do not understand the exact meaning of a map 			
Perhaps we are not sure what a map conveys or what a map is			
likely to present to us 			
That shows there is a need to define the term map			
 			
 Map is nothing but representation of 			
the whole surface of the earth or part of the surface of the earth			
according to scale 			
When I use the word whole surface of the earth I mean the world 			
When I say a portion of the earth that means it can be a town it			
can be a village 			
Now when I use the word scale the scale means that all the			
things that we find in the reality cannot be transferred on a map 			
You have to represent that's found in the reality 			
In other words that one inch if you draw on a map perhaps			
it represent sixteen kilometres on the ground 			
That shows the scale is one inch to sixteen kilometres 			
Now if one has to explain the concept of a map let us take			
a very very simple example 			
You are calling your friend home for a dinner and you have			
given the address too to him 			
But he finds it extremely difficult to locate your house 			
After a few queries perhaps you feel that your friend is not			
confident to reach your home 			
May be you would like to take a small piece of paper and draw a few			
lines clearly indicating what is a road on which your house is located			
 what's a land mark which is quite simple to identify and			
how to reach your place 			
Well this sketch makes the man more confident and he			
is able to get himself acquainted with your area and he will be able to			
reach home confidently 			
Now what does it mean ?			
It means that you have drawn a part of the city in a small			
sketch to convey the message to your friend 			
I call this as the concept of map 			
Well if you agree that any message can be transmitted in			
the form of a map 			
Now we would like to know how often we use map 			
Well how old is this concept ?			
You would like to know whether we came to know about maps only			
recently or it has a history behind 			
I would like to say that the concept of map was dates			
back to six hundred B C 			
Greeks and Romans were the pioneers to introduce the concept of			
map 			
Perhaps you would like to know that in second century A D 			
it is Ptolemy who brought the concept of the map for the whole			
world 			
However the accuracy of the map is not that encouraging			
Very rough idea of the world was given 			
But very accurate map dates back to sixteen seventy-eight			
I would like to show now a map which is quite 			
accurate accurately drawn during the historical period			
Here you have a map which was drawn in the year			
sixteen seventy-eight 			
And it is the history's first accurately drawn map			
It represents facts which is drawn with true to scale and			
the colour which you could see here is nothing but hand painted			
colour 			
After watching the historical map which is hand painted			
 the maps have gone a revolution in terms of painting and			
production 			
 Today's maps are multicoloured and looks 			
pleasant and more informative 			
But the maps have also incorporated concepts like 			
direction distance and location 			
These three concepts have been given more importance in			
the modern maps 			
I would like to show a map of Tamil Nadu wherein 			
the concept of location direction and distance could be 			
easily seen 			
We have a map here which is a representation of 			
Tamil Nadu state 			
If you look into this map very carefully the first thing			
that comes to your mind is the location of places 			
Here I have the location of Bangalore which is given in			
the form of a black dot and this is exactly known as location of a			
particular place 			
Our next concept is the direction 			
I have here marked a red arrow line facing towards the			
top which is nothing but the northern direction 			
In other words most of the maps are prepared towards			
northern direction on the top of the map 			
Well from the direction we move to the scale 			
The scales are given at the bottom sometimes both in the			
form of figures as well as in the form of equivalance roughly six			
point eight miles on the ground represented on one centimetre in the map			
A map contains two important components 			
Number one it is a skill in art 			
Number two it is the technical skill which is needed to draft a			
map 			
Skill in art means the designing of a map 			
positioning of letters symbols title writing and drawing the			
 components inside a map which should be more pleasing aesthetic			
 to the viewer or to a map user 			
Similarly the second part of it which I call it as a technical			
drafting is a very difficult job because the maps have to be			
 drawn according to scale and the information have to be			
transferred into a map in a systematic manner so that the			
minds idea follow the things in a very very systematic manner 			
It is very difficult to understand what is the step by step 			
movements 			
Because a map is a highest form of graphic it is in a			
position to create a visual image in your mind 			
You will keep things in your mind for a long time to come 			
Its quite easier to understand that map is a very powerful			
tool of communication 			
I would like to now explain how a written text and a			
map if they are together how do they convey the message to you			
Let us look at a small piece of information which I have			
taken from a newspaper 			
We will look into that in a more systematic manner 			
Here is a small cutting wherein you will be able to see the			
text which is written over here and simultaneously on the other side			
a map is drawn 			
Perhaps you will understand that this map is			
complementary to the text 			
I do agree 			
But if you look into the text very carefully you will know			
that as you read the sentences it will go into your mind and you			
will be able to understand the news in a systematic manner 			
Perhaps if you read only the first sentence and jump into the			
last sentence you will miss the message 			
You will not be able to receive anything 			
Therefore you are required to move sentence by sentence to			
understand the message 			
So is the case with the map 			
If I have to say Today I am going to deal with Kuwait			
 			
That means first I should know where Kuwait is located in the			
Middle East 			
And here is the small insert map which gives an idea that where			
is Kuwait located 			
From that you move on to the Kuwait and its surrounding			
countries with physical as well as cultural features 			
So your eye and mind goes step by step from one message to			
another message 			
All these messages are slowly steadily kept in your mind			
 and you can retrieve this message in a more systematic manner 			
In addition to this possibly you not only store this message in			
your mind you will be able to interpret the news in a much more			
scientific way in order to understand the situation better 			
Therefore I would say that map is a very powerful tool of			
communication 			
Let us look at the map in the form of a globe 			
You are able to see this globe now wherein the land			
 sea are distributed in aesthetical manner 			
This is more or less true to the reality 			
But you will be able to see that the size of the land 			
especially if you could watch the Greenland which is quite small in			
size as compared with the Canada United States 			
etcetera 			
But if this globe has to be broken into several parts 			
and then represent in a plain sheet of paper how difficult it will be			
It will be definitely difficult to represent this on a			
plain sheet of paper because this will be distorted 			
Once it is distorted the figures will not appear clearly 			
the shape size scale will all vary 			
Therefore there is a need of mathematical calculation of 			
latitudes and longitudes to be corrected in such a manner so that			
entire thing can be transferred on a plain sheet of paper 			
For this process we use a technical term known as projection			
The projection is nothing but arrangement of latitude and			
longitude in such a manner so that you represent the surface of the			
earth any part of the surface of the earth according to correct shape 			
and size 			
Here is a world map wherein the entire land and ocean is			
represented in a plain sheet of paper 			
You are able to see the Greenland which is bigger than 			
Canada 			
Whereas in the previous scene we have seen in the globe that			
Greenland was much smaller than Canada this indicates that the			
representation of the sphere on a plain sheet of paper necessarily			
brings distortion of shape and size 			
Now symbols are the most important components of a map 			
I would like you to look at the symbols which are given in			
a map drawn for India 			
If we look into this map it is a tourist road map 			
of India wherein the symbols are given in different forms 			
The first and the foremost symbol is the administrative symbols			
In other words the administrative symbols are nothing but lines			
 drawn to show the administrative boundaries 			
Now this particular line is a line which separates India			
from Nepal 			
And this administrative line is known as international boundary			
When we come down you will be able to see the boundary line			
which separates Uttar Pradesh from Madhya Pradesh 			
Again this is another symbol which represents the 			
administrative set up of the country 			
After that the most important symbol that we would like to look			
into is the physical symbol 			
Physical means that the representation of the physical			
details of a map 			
Here we are able to see the river which is given in the form			
of a blue line 			
Now usually the rivers are given blue lines mainly because one			
is able to perceive the reality in without much difficulty 			
After the river symbols probably the next one which attracts most			
us is the cultural symbols 			
The cultural symbols the good example will be a road 			
Now the Hyderabad is connected to Nagpur via highway 			
which is given in the form of a red line 			
Like this almost all the symbols are carried out in a map in a			
sophisticated manner so that each symbol merges with the map in a systematic			
manner			
The next important component is lettering 			
The size style direction of letters do indicate			
 different type of messages 			
The size of the letters do indicate the hierarchy of place			
names 			
The direction of letters also indicate the style as well as			
the slope of a river 			
Similarly if a group of islands have to be shown they are			
written in such a manner so that it covers all the distribution of islands			
Now in this map the first thing is that the title is			
written in a corner below which you will find the scale is written			
Below the scale you will find the term legend 			
indicating that all the details which have gone into the map are			
given 			
In other words that in the format one should be in a			
position to read first this and then familarise himself with the			
details then go to the map to read the map what it is all about 			
The second most important thing that you have to keep in mind is			
 the design of the total format wherein you will be able to see 			
the inner line will give you the latitude and longitude boundary the			
outer line will give you the finishing for the entire map 			
All the details should come between these lines which are			
known as neat lines 			
In the black and white map you are unable to distinguish 			
between one region to another region and different symbols 			
Whereas in a colour map the eye catches the difference at			
much faster rate 			
In other words from the point of your communication it			
appears that colour seems to play a most important role 			
If we look into these maps you will be able to see that 			
this is the map of the city of Madras 			
It is a large scale map 			
But here we have the tourist map of Tamil Nadu which is a			
small scale map 			
So maps can be classified on the basis of the scale so that it			
is easy to identify the specific purpose for which the map is prepared 			
We could see today in the world the educationists school			
children scientists planners administrators politicians 			
business people all of them are using the maps in some form or other			
The man who draws this map usually called as a cartographer 			
The subject which deals with designing drafting and			
printing of maps usually known as cartography 			
Well today we could see that the developments in the field of			
cartography or in the preparation of maps have reached such a high			
standard that computer technology and satellite imageries have come			
into a great way in expanding the scope of mapping the earths surface 			
Maps are part and parcel of life 			
One is able to convey the message more effectively accurately			
 scientifically through maps 			
And it reminds us a graphical age in your mind the years			
to come 			
I am sure you will also agree with me that there is a need to			
create this awareness in the utility of maps in the man's 			
life 			
In today's programme we bring you a talk on the British			
policy towards the tribes of north east India in the nineteenth century			
The talker is Dr Anwar Hussein lecturer in the department of			
History Dibrugarh University 			
After the first Anglo-Burmese war of eighteen twenty-four			
 twenty-six the British established themselves in the valley of			
the Brahmaputra expelling the Burmese from the country 			
Then they now face the new problem the problem of the hill			
tribes in the north east frontier 			
So the reason to formulate a policy which was not a static one			
 but it had to be geared up to beat the exigencies in the frontiers			
The aim and object of the policy was to control the tribal			
areas for the excercise of limited administrative authority 			
The political aspect of the policy and all states was to			
use the tribes on the eastern fringes as a screen between the newly			
acquired territories and the kingdom of Burma was initiated 			
With a view to using the Sinko's tracks as a screen			
 east of armies treaties were signed between Sinko chiefs and the			
company chiefs 			
The Mamoir tracks were also kept separate from the upper			
Assam principality of Purander Sinha who was enthroned in			
eighteen thirty-two and allowed to rule till eighteen thirty-eight 			
for securing ready supply of provisions for British troops passing			
through the region 			
But exodia and jaitu contingence of British army 			
were deployed to observe the in what activities of the			
frontiers 			
The Austro mongoloid hill tribes in north eastern India on			
the other hand had maintained a potential isolation for centuries			
The mountainous character of the territory linguistic			
variations inter-clan feud and inter-tribal warfare had			
prevented political union among the hillman 			
While the superstitious customs of head hunting and			
sorcery practised by some of the tribes engendered that 			
a policy of indifference on the part of the neighbouring rulers 			
in the plains 			
The hills were clotted with dense forests and bordered by			
patches of hollows and swamps 			
The physiographic conditions rendered inter-communications			
 almost impossible 			
And while the climate was extremely innovating and the people			
of the hill areas had to live in seclusion 			
So the tribes except towards the west outside the western			
boundary of Bhutan there was no organised kingdom hence they			
were not capable of resisting the British arms 			
Beginning with the Bhutias of Bhutan a series of			
engagement enter with the tribes by which they undertook to			
surrender their rights in these territories for a consideration			
of regular payment of compensation by the Company's government			
But the government in return intended not to interfere in			
the internal affairs what were left alone in the hills 			
In primitive times the payment of compensation in the form			
of pasa or assignment of a part of revenue was a			
system interlift by Ahom to reoncile the hill tribes on the			
frontiers of the kingdom 			
But British made a substantial change in the system which was			
existed during the Ahom time 			
It stopped a direct collection of the dues by the tribes			
 themselves from the rayats because it led			
sometimes to quarrels 			
Instead of it begin to pay them some cash which was known			
as black mail and it was collected at the same time through dues			
from the rayats who were exempted from payment of			
dues to the tribesman 			
This system actually cut off the direct link between the			
 rayat and the tribes 			
To begin with the attitude of the tribes towards the			
British government did not seem to be hostile 			
The Kamtis and Shintos accepted the British overtures of			
friendship and their by British was successfully the entering			
 into sort of ties with them 			
Abars was also friendly till the middle of the century 			
The Dafalas and Aakals agreed to accept the money			
payment in lieu of their right to collect their pasa 			
 in the due in the doers 			
But after the consolidation of the British rule in Assam 			
the tribes became alive to the ensuing danger of the new system and			
became restless 			
Though the Kamtis revolted with the assistance of Shintos 			
or in the pandal was suppressed by the British arms and			
divided the whole country areas into four tracks which was under			
the direct control of the government 			
Like the Shintos the Abars the Aakal the Dafalas			
 created problem during the British regime 			
The Nagas of the Tira district continued to committ petty theft			
and loot for a quiet long time 			
So the guzzling feast of rich and other tribals had to do			
 due to their frustration and poverty in their economic and			
political reason 			
So the British government had gradually begun to			
substitute cash payment in lieu of articles and the money payment 			
which was fixed with the then market price remained fixed all			
through the British period 			
In order to solve the tribal problem the British government 			
introduce certain policies 			
For example number one to set up out-post along roads			
of the tribal movement to set the encroach of the tribe 			
Number two restrictions on plains people entering into hills			
for which the innerline regulation was passed in eighteen seventy-three			
 which restricted the entrance of the plains people into the			
tribal hill areas 			
And thus minimised the contact between the hills and			
the plains 			
Number three to popular popularise 			
the British manufactured products in the tribal hill areas 			
In popularising the European products all good 			
and promoting their sale they first had vital importance 			
As a result tribal products mainly raw materials 			
came down in the market and European good powered into the			
tribal territory etcetera 			
Apart from this it is predict if we see the character			
of the British policy then we'll find that the hill areas			
in north eastern India enjoyed a distinct feature in the			
administrative map of British India 			
The system innovated tended to serve the colonial interest			
Anxiety for the difference of imperial frontier with China and			
Burma protection of villages in the plains from tribal rage 			
And exploitation of economic resources of the hill had			
prompted the British authorities to abandon the earlier theory of non-			
intervention 			
The traditional institution were not disturbed and the			
tribesman were allowed to feel that they were still governed by their			
hereditary chiefs 			
But the concept of a free man was completely lost and the			
chiefs were no better than government servants 			
The excluding regulation created a gap between the people			
of the hill and the plains and even in the hill areas there were			
several administrative blocks like excluded area and control area			
A series of the administrative borders were created in the			
region and stringent restrictions were imposed upon the			
outsiders in this area 			
Tribal and non-tribal were infused as new social term 			
in Indian social structure 			
The lost balance of unrestricted trade in the hill borders			
 and a process of social assimilation was began in the			
foothills 			
The seat is set back due to the segregrain 			
policy of the British 			
The other factor was education which was left entirely to			
western missionaries who were invited by the government to undertake			
 post le postalisation and the			
schools were supported under gram scheme aid system			
In the beginning Bengali was the medium of instruction and			
tribal languages were written in Bengali script 			
But subsequently English became the medium and Bengali			
script was replaced by Roman 			
The integration of the hill people with the rest of the country			
 would have been accomplished as a natural process but the			
colonial attitude of the British segregating regulations and			
creations of the administrative artificial walls create a big vacuum			
Large number of hillman converted into Christianity but			
those who believed traditional religion and practices the age old			
customs were reformed as non Christians as if they had no religion			
 to be mentioned 			
There is no reason to accept the western science of			
civilization as in a wastage 			
While some traditional customs are highly scientific 			
and many in Indian situation 			
So the aim of the British was to safeguard their imperial 			
interest and try to justify the colonial control by projecting			
 some wrong understanding about the indigenous system of the hill			
people as backward unemployed their own way of administration			
 in the hill areas of the north eastern region 			
			Radio Sangli 
			The time is eight fifteen p m 
			Tomorrow is to observe this event we now bring you a talk
			entitled Higher education and women 
			The speaker is Dr Vasanti Rasam 
			And she is highlighting the factors responsible for such a low
			female literacy and makes certain recommendation 
			Problems of women can be visualised in almost all forms of
			system with varying degrees 
			Neverthless women in socialist nations seem to have come a long way
			in achieving equal status to that of man 
			On the other hand Indian women have been oppressed in all the
			fields at two levels at the caste and class level 
			In educational sphere too women have been opressed under the
			traditional set up of our society 
			Recently there is a growing tendency towards improving the
			conditions of women in India considering them to be a part of national
			development process 
			The major thrust of the Seventh Five Year Plan 
			 was on the development of women 
			The basic approach would be to enable women to acquire
			confidence in themselves and to develop a sense of responsibility 
			towards the overall development and betterment of society and their
			individual personality 
			All this comes in a country where horrifying atrocities have
			been committed against women since ages 
			Even fifty years ago female infanticide child marriage 
			and subsequent widowhood sati devdasi etcetera were
			widely prevalent and are still heard of in rural areas 
			With independence came the age of social reform to eradicate
			the evils against women 
			But still today even if you just scratch the surface of Indian
			culture we are exposed to the male dominated society 
			Where did we go wrong then ?
			Why does the Indian women still reveal in stereotype role of
			self sacrifice rather than those of self awareness ?
			The blame must surely lie at the doors of our educational
			system which is nearly a ritual rather than an effective means of
			equalising opportunity and erasing the sex bias 
			Education for girls was and is still influenced by a wide range
			of factors which are considerably different from those that affect boys
			education 
			It can be noted that girls education at large was encouraged 
			and tolerated after an age or after certain standard at which it can
			do little good or little harm 
			The notion that education itself whether primary secondary or
			higher is harmful was prevalent upto yester years and is still
			relevent as far as higher education is concerned 
			This notion limited the exposure of women to the external
			world and influences 
			The basic conviction that there is something special about womens
			nature which could be destroyed by excessive education portrayed the
			uniqueness of women and hence the difference in the syllabii of boys and
			girls 
			The rudiments of reading writing a little arithmatic hygiene needle
			work embroidery and vernacular language were being regarded as
			more than adequate for girls 
			Once a demand for women's education came from the social
			reformers for their emancipation there was also demand for educated
			bride for a new western educated breed of men 
			Thereby expanding the aim of education for girls from competent
			wife and mother to intelligent companion 
			The liberational role of education emphasised by the radicals
			had been subordinated to the social goal of willing admissal and not
			a questioning and an enquiring mind 
			Here one can note the conflict between the ideals of womenhood
			of our society and the ideals of education which lead to creation of
			a certain measure of independent thought a spirit of enquiry and of
			objectivity which as a bind by men of our society could threaten 
			the well maintained differences between the sexes 
			And they also feared that their control over women would be
			marginalised with too much of education of wrong kind 
			This ideological difference continued to be preserved today 
			despite the efforts made by various planning commissions for the
			improvement of female literacy 
			 Mrs Durgabai Deshmukh committee put forth the
			view that in no way was education a threat to family life and that today
			 there was a need to break the barriers of the gender based division of
			work 
			This opinion was reiterated by the Kothari Commission
			 also 
			 The Hansa Mehta Committee holds that
			inequality of sexes is built in the minds of men and women through
			socialisation which continues to be extremely powerful 
			Which was also accepted by the committee on status of women in
			India in ninety seventy-four 
			Of recent the Seventh Five Year Plan 
			threw the challenge to education a policy perspective listed some
			laudable goals of education for women also 
			Despite the above effort and an increase in the girls
			enrollment at primary and middle school level the percentage of absolute
			 or absolute magnitude as compared to boys is still low 
			Further even though the performance of girls compared
			favourably with that of boys only a limited number of girls seek
			admission into higher education or professional courses other than those
			pertaining to medicine teachers' training and nursing 
			The drop out rate also in case of girls at middle school level
			is much higher than boys 
			What then are the specific reasons for such low female literacy
			 ?
			One of course is poverty where a family's economic
			 and financial problem do not give an opportunity to girls where
			preference is for educating a son rather than a daughter who is to be
			married off and sent to some another family 
			The second reason could be classified as ignorance or cultural
			biases of society and the consequent belief that education is irrelevent
			to the future role expectation of a wife and a mother 
			It may be observed that many parents still hesitate to send girls
			to distant or coeducational institution and are averse to those in which
			there are no women teachers 
			While for the rural women education is considered unnecessary
			 for an urban women it is merely a value wager in the competitive marriage
			market 
			Despite the fact that the system has the attitude the
			brother is encouraged to take up higher education at all cost 
			This is due to the influence of nonacademic factors related to
			social and familiar expectation as to what a girls basic role in life
			is to be a good bride intelligent companion but not an enquiring
			mind but a devoted mother and who may if she has time work at
			most as a teacher or as a clerk 
			It is also unfortunately true that even girls at large choose
			to believe that there can be no fulfilment in combining many roles or
			to compete in the male dominated area 
			Interesting factors that the proportion of women to men at the post
			graduate level is higher than at the undergraduate level which
			shows that once women in certain areas are able to break the barriers of
			prejudice they proceed to acquire further degree and perhaps a job 
			not doubting their aptitude but have mental ability of her mind 
			Indian woman today is caught up in the terrible cross current 
			on one hand she is a best by model handed down by our
			traditional society and on the other she is being communicated by
			various agencies negating these morals 
			Woman therefore is responsible themselves partially as
			she does not take a stance even when she is badly pushed 
			Those who have an opportunity to get higher education even as
			far as post graduation and doctorate are not able to decide for
			themselves to make a career as it would depend once again on the
			man her husband or in-laws to decide for her future after her
			marriage 
			 There's no doubt state of women literacy is improving
			 yet as compared to that of male literacy is still low more so in
			rural areas 
			Moreover even today educational institutions are not
			regarded as institutions for acquiring knowledge and for providing training
			for a good vocation but as respectable waiting rooms for girls who
			are to be married off 
			Thus the function of education also will relatively be
			 different in case of girls and boys to date 
			The dilemma casued by the exposure to the external world 
			coupled with a need to keep in touch with the notion of female dependency is
			result by choosing well demarketed suitable areas or otherwise called the
			safe educational realms of study for girls and avoiding others 
			The major efforts of the libera liberal
			 forces to improve womens educational status by raising the age
			of marriage and emphasising education as an important means of
			emancipation cannot be denied 
			Yet the liberal view of education as a liberating force 
			is however undermined or the limit to access to education
			posed by womens role in the family 
			For all the classes of women the content in role of education
			victory a deep ambivalence between womens role and individual growth 
			Thus if education is to play a due role in translating 
			women's equality from the pages of the constitution to actual
			reality then education policy must introduce basic issues like as
			access or reduction and later elimination of gender disparity within
			the educational process which also reflects in employment socio-political
			participation opportunities for personal growth and competence which
			alone can build defences against degradation exploitation or
			oppression and lead to self confident individual 
			This requires educational system to take up the task of
			changing the attitude and values regarding womens role and rights in society
			 to one of the equal participation in all socio- economic and
			political processes and national and international development 
			For this the educational programme for female literacy needs to
			be re-evaluated and formulated a new in the light of experience of
			the bygone years 
			A general plan for education which is not taken into account 
			the specific problems faced by women fails to benefit them 
			Thus a kind of grassroot input is necessary so that 
			the programmes planned at the ministerial level translate themselves into
			meaningful developmental input

Title Economic Imparities of the New Government			
 			
The speaker is Shri Prabhakar Angre 			
Never in the post-Independence history of the country a			
government has had to face massive challeges such as the one 			
which is two weeks old government of India had to endure with 			
Though the government is solidarily responsible to find a			
solution to economic problem a lot depends upon the present finance			
minister in formulating policies which will take care of the			
situation 			
Our main concern today is to retain the status of non defaulter			
 in honouring our financial committments 			
For the first time after Independence our pay deficit has			
crossed rupees ten thousand crore 			
Our balance of payment position is critical mainly due to			
our sluggish growth in export which have been below the set target 			
and also a declined in N R I remittances 			
We have had three successive good monsoons inspite of these			
 even the usual seasonal decline in prices of food grains has not			
been experienced and the inflation has already crossed double			
digit mark 			
The economic imparities before the new government are 			
containment of fiscal and revenue deficit servicing of foreign debt 			
contracting additional foreign debt to tide over the crisis 			
improvement in our foreign exchange reserves and bringing down the			
inflation rate to four to five percent within the next two three			
years 			
If politician colleague of our finance minister allow him			
 to adopt pragmatic policies and do not pressurise him for adopting			
populace measures he may be able to present a budget which will be			
indicative of his resolve to take up the country from its present			
morale 			
According to official estimates the gap between government			
revenue and its total expenditure represent eight point five percent			
 of countrys gross domestic product which is estimated in the region			
of rupees five and eight thousand crore 			
Only the revenue deficit which was just rupees 			
 one thousand six hundred and sixteen crore in			
nineteen eighty eighty-one shot up to rupees twelve			
thousand four hundred and thirty-six crores in nineteen			
eighty-nine ninety 			
Our foreign exchange reserves which were above seven			
million dollars in nineteen eighty fell to four million dollars in			
nineteen eighty-nine and today they are just sufficient to cover			
two weeks import of the country 			
Our debts service coverage issue which was eight percent of			
export earnings in nineteen eighty eighty-one is now estimated at			
about thirty percent whereas this debt level should not cross twenty			
percent 			
According to a recent world bank report India's 			
 trade regime is restrictive discretionary complex and			
most difficult to administer and hence it needs to be drastically			
over hauled 			
The world bank has recommended among other measures 			
abolition of quantitative restriction on import cutting custom tariff			
 from an average of hundred and seventeen percents to not more than			
twenty percent jacking up of excise duties to make up the short fall			
etcetera 			
The recommendations do not appear to be palatable to many 			
but in the absence of a more acceptable alternative there is no escape			
 from accepting the recommendations of the world bank 			
It will be necessary for the country to change its economic			
policies relevant to the nineties and make a departure should			
have an extremely close allies of among themselves so as to make			
the maximum use of the available resources 			
The whole world is vying to attract foreign investment 			
The developed world is waiting for India to open up but it			
will not wait indefinitely 			
Foreign equity is recently pre 			
preferable to foreign loan and we should loose no time in			
evolving a clear cut policy conducive to attract the foreign investment			
 in our country 			
Such a step will reduce our interest burden on foreign loan 			
and to that extent our balance of payment position will improve 			
In view of the establishment of European economic community 			
 India's export will have to face a fierce international			
competition in terms of prices quality specification and			
delivery 			
The country will have to evolve positive policies to boost			
export including those considering the trade union which			
sometimes takes some action detremental to keeping delivery schedule			
Our present export are only five point five percents of			
gross national product whereas China and Indonesia have achieved			
the percentage of fourteen and twenty-one percents respectively 			
The recent devaluation of rupee is expected to			
give a big boost to export though other consequences will have			
to be considered 			
Other important conditionalities prescribed by the world bank			
 are export of nine percent in government expenditure and a drastic			
reduction in agricultural subsidy 			
For a popularly elected government these are going to be hard			
decisions but its reduction in agricultural subsidies is accompanied			
by an upward revision of procurement prices so farmers lobby could			
be quitened 			
It is estimated that the annual outgo on various subsidies 			
including the concealed one at the centre and state level is nearly			
 rupees sixty thousand crores which			
represent twelve percent of our gross national product 			
State electricity board has huge accumulated losses 			
essentially because they are not allowed to charge commercial rates			
to the consumer 			
In in case of agriculture we loose about forty-five 			
paise per unit 			
This is the reason why the policies of the government they			
are not economically viable 			
If populism is persued beyond the point it would become counter			
productive and frustrating 			
Investment made from borrowed capitals should yield return			
 higher than the interest rate so that they can take care of			
payment of interest and one word of the principal amount 			
Greater and rising productivity alone can lead the country			
 along the path of stability and progress 			
All these years the policy makers have found it difficult 			
to politically follow what they should have economically followed			
 and as a consequence of which our country has turned now to be a high			
cost economy and we are outcast in the global market 			
In nineteen fifty India steel price was the cheapest in the			
world today it is the costliest 			
 Coal India Limited is over staffed with			
about one lakh workers and there is no political will			
 to deal with redundant labour 			
Food subsidies are given to every one irrespective of his			
income bracket 			
Payment as resources are vested in keeping loss making			
public sector units alive 			
A big chunk of bank funds is blocked in sick unit which are			
not allowed to die their natural death because of labour conflict 			
The purpose of world bank suggestive reforms has been to			
increase the productivity and efficiency of Indian economy upgradation of			
technological base and improve its international competitiveness 			
These are the objectives all of us want to achieve 			
The suggested reforms package is also gradual and safe 			
making the state regime more transparent less bureaucratic and more			
liberal 			
Thus it is not to be rejected only because it has a			
conditionality of the world bank 			
The world bank will consider a further plan of five to			
seven billion dollars after examining the austerity measures			
initiated by the government of India and hence there appears to be			
no escape from choosing the fiscal course that is a part of			
international monitory funds standard prescription for countrys having			
serious balance of payment problem 			
In the light of economic imparities we have to address			
ourselves to the forthcoming budget formulation and its provisions			
must give clear signals to assess international situation that India			
is serious and has the capability to implement some of the harshest			
measures to correct fiscal anomolies in the Indian economy system and			
reform the situation on all fronts 			
This will convince international creditors international			
monetary funds and the world bank the need to support India by			
providing the necessary cushions against precarious balance of payment			
position 			
The budget will have to spell out a long term integrated			
economic policy covering digit matters relating to monetary 			
fiscal industrial in which would need a loan of about ten to			
fifteen billion dollar to plan a definite programme 			
Piecemeal assistance may not help much 			
The budget will have to lay a special emphasis on export			
promotion 			
Presently export documents have to be signed at two hundred			
and fifty places and hundred and eighteen papers have to be completed 			
in the estimated time involved in this operation is twenty-two hours 			
The paper work as ten percent of the cost in United States			
only five documents are enough for export clearance 			
 India's external sectors have seldom seen the type of			
problem which it is now witnessing and overcoming the same will need			
 some very committed action from the government and unflinching			
support from the opposition parties in the parliament 			
That was a talk in English entitled Economic			
Imparities of the New Government 			
The speaker was shri Prabhakar Angre 			
 recording broken 			
The journey was by itself not attracting much attention seem			
to take longer than usual at last I was at the door step and on			
entering the house first thing that I learnt was that my cousins had			
not arrived 			
Suddenly the journey that I had just completed appeared to be			
much more troublesome than what it actually was 			
Every part of my body began complaining loud and clear not			
being much interested in the delicious food prepared my by by my aunt I			
slept hoping that this brother of mine would wake would wake me up in the			
morning 			
The dawn passed and so did the noon and the sun had 			
began begun to set			
The phone bell rang having grown tired of waiting and having			
cursed him for what would be enough for a life time to bear I was			
convinced that the phone carried a message saying we would be arriving on			
twenty-sixth 			
But no my spirits were once again reaching sky high when I			
heard that Raju had rung from the Pu Pune 			
railway station itself and in no more than half an hour there we			
were all beholding this great man 			
He was indeed given a rousing welcome under my leadership 			
after having sufficiently aroused the emotion of other family members I			
was not much surprised to note that his knowledge about this whole affair 			
was not as much compared to mine 			
Trying to defend ourselves of this adventure or misadventure 			
that was to follow bearing the brunt of all the criticism which was whole			
heartedly poured on us we realised that it was just a couple of 			
hours before the departure of the Jhelum 			
Jhelum did depart sharp at five thirty from Pune as scheduled 			
And the two of us sitting facing each other deeply 			
engaged in studying the railway time table where we were to go and			
how the train sped fast and this was one of my first journey 			
in a vestibule train which had an attached pantry car and the sun			
 was preparing to make way for the bright star of the night 			
We decided to have our dinner courtesy Indian railway 			
Hardly a few hours passed we thought of stroll through the			
compartment and believe me what a sight it was with the new			
considerations to our ages there was enough happenings around that			
made us a little uneasy 			
For a moment there seem to be a variety of different cinemas 			
being screened all around			
When the noise of food being served made us rush back to			
our seat 			
The food was interesting not delicious as such 			
My cousin had never ventured to call anything edible bad 			
Sleep thrust in with a mixed feelings having decided to			
make all the purchases that were to be done at Pune we reached Delhi 			
The train was to halt there for three hours 			
The experience in travelling in a vestibule train with			
an attached pantry car the unknown destination and happiness or hardship			
that were to be part of the journey 			
Both my cousin and myself are always used to sound sleep 			
in the night immaterial of the time place etcetera 			
When the dawn broke we were amidst what was known as the heart of			
India 			
We were travelling through the terrain of Chambal valley 			
The numerous hillocks with tricky passages in between we			
believed were the most apt for hideout 			
Admittedly many had discovered this fact much before us 			
The vast expanse of such similar pattern did indeed put up a			
scenery quite unforgettable 			
Suddenly this gave a an instinct to my			
 cousin's mind Why not plan the return journey 			
We were to reach Delhi by eight p m and the train was to halt			
there for full three hours 			
If the journey through central India is so beautiful how would			
it be to return along the west coast 			
Brilliant idea indeed and the railway time table was once again			
searched 			
Before all this was completed we reached Jhansi station 			
On the adjacent platform there was something really extraordinary			
 a beautiful blue and yellow colour train the engine shaped like			
an aeroplane 			
 O yes it was indeed the two thousand one up 			
Shatabdi Express the fastest train in India 			
And as though to remind us all about the journey we had a			
glimpse of the derailed bogies of the unfortunate Karnataka			
Express little further 			
All this time the pantry car had kept us happy and satisfied 			
As if to prove the station master right when he writes below			
the time table in station Trains are liable to gain or lose time			
 Jhelum Express screeched into the New Delhi station only three			
and half hours late 			
Off we were hunting for the reservation counter only to be			
enlightened by the vendor that the counter in the station closed by five			
thirty p m 			
All our hopes were dashed 			
We had expected a twenty-four hour booking counter at New Delhi			
station 			
We were to do a lot of purchases and this was now hampered and			
transferred to Jammu Tavi 			
We had not opted for the pantry car dinner in anticipation of the			
food at New Delhi 			
Midnight vendor and some fruitwalas made our			
appetite full 			
The halt was cut down by an hour and a half 			
And by one in the morning we started advancing further north 			
The crowd in the train was gradually growing less in number 			
with large group detraining at various stops 			
The last of our companions got down at Jallandhar leaving			
only two of us from the original pack 			
The pantry car too was disconnected at Delhi and when we woke			
up in the morning My goodness what a sight it was with green			
lustrious inviting plains of Punjab 			
 Far as far as the eyes could see spread over from one			
horizon to the other the vast stretch of land as though somebody had			
levelled it totally green thick with vegetation with a lot of			
streams running in between 			
Oh what a place it was 			
As the arrival time at the Jammu Tavi station neared we			
were both anticipating to watch the foot hills of Himalaya 			
After chhole parathe at Pathankot the train did			
come to a halt on a platform which borne the name Jammu Tavi			
 			
But where were the hills ?			
Sense dawned that they were to begin further north 			
Trapped by a local commission agent we were about to			
reside in a lodge when yet another person showed us a bus standing right			
in front of us which was bound to Shrinagar 			
It has the name board in Urdu 			
Thanking the second one heartedly we were in the bus and the			
final leg of the journey had begun 			
In sheer contrast to all that we had seen till now this part was			
unique the hills for which we had been longing for so long were			
right in front of us 			
And our bus began its quest towards Shrinagar about two hundred			
and forty-eight kilometres drive roughly five hours by our calculation			
The bus began to turn right left right and I lost count			
at the number of turns 			
There was a range of mountains in front of us and slowly the			
bus began to scale its height			
And just as the last curve took us to the upper most point			
of it and there was yet another range of mountains taller than that 			
of the previous one 			
At the end of it again there was yet another range it was			
as if the Himalayas were unfolding themselves layer by layer and you			
never knew what was beyond that curve 			
There was no let up and we kept on climbing the mountain that			
were seeming sky high now began appearing reasonable and as night			
approached we reached Baltal 			
Just as we were lamenting that we would be deprived of the sight of			
remaining journey in darkness the driver announced that the bus was to			
halt overnight at Baltal			
And begin the quest early next morning 			
We were all the more overjoyed and slept in the hotel 			
The next morning as the mountains continued to show their great			
might and energy with roaring of streams in the valley getting louder			
around each curve and streams themselves becoming smaller in size			
The bus then was halted in a queue and a curious stroll gave us			
the glimpse of the one of the great engineering marvels of our nation			
The Jawaharlal Nehru tunnel the longest of its kind and			
appropriately it was insc it was inscribed 			
 may your life be as long as this tunnel 			
Photography was prohibited and the journey through this			
twenty-six kilometre long tunnel brought us out in front of another			
amazing array of mountains each of them trying to make the other			
appear smaller 			
The clouds were almost with us now and we did still keep			
climbing higher and higher 			
It was almost began to seem endless 			
I had in my school days seen Ooty but by now we must have			
travelled the road to Ooty say about ten times 			
Almost every inch of these mountains had tall trees trying			
to out do the mountains in reaching the sky 			
Following this was again a long stretch of plain road 			
impossible we had thought that there being such a long stretch of plain land			
after this climb but then it was the Kashmir valley 			
Admiring beautiful nature we never realised that our bus by			
now was standing in the compound of the tourist reception centre at Shrinagar			
Oh god what a journey it had been not a bit of this kind			
had ever occurred to us 			
No not even in the wildest of our dreams 			
From there we proceeded straight to the youth hostel camping			
grounds 			
Thus if you look into the journey itself a lot of things do			
happen that teach us lessons in the philosophy practicability			
etcetera only it needs a willful learner 			
Festivals are rightly said to be the living history of a			
nation 			
They are inextricably linked with the culture religion 			
philosophy and literature of a people 			
And are thus connected with the innocent of man 			
India is a unique country in the sense that it has such a large			
number of festivals which have become living traditions of a unique			
nature 			
They carry rhythm the entire story of the growth of our culture			
 mostly in a condensed form 			
So much so that it has become almost impossible to single			
out an incident or factor associated with a particular Indian festival			
 It's equally futile now to say that a particular caste			
or section of society is primarily responsible for a particular			
festival in the modern context 			
 Raksha Bandhan is one of such unique festivals			
 of our country 			
 It's a cultural festival of the Aryan race 			
It is celebrated on the full moon day of Shravan			
 and that is why it is also called Shravani 			
A very old name of this festival is Rishi tarpan			
 also 			
On this particular day Brahmins used to put on new sacred			
threads or a one word 			
The rituals of yadnya were performed and the			
heads of ashramas tied sacred yellow thread around			
the wrists of the people while chanting vedic hymns 			
Subsequently this thread itself came to be known as			
 Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi 			
As said earlier quite a few stories are associated with this			
festival 			
One of them reminds us of the great daitya 			
king Bali living long long before Ram in the treta yug			
 			
Bali took a vow of defeating Indra and ruling over the			
entire universe including swarg lok 			
He went to his guru Shukracharya bid to him			
his compliments and sought his blessings 			
 Daitya guru Shukra gave his blessings to Bali 			
with a holy tilak on his forehead and a sacred thread			
 or raksha sutra around his wrist this made Bali			
strong and invincible on the battle field 			
He wiped out his enemies and became the supreme power in the			
universe 			
During the later feudal ages the kings and warriors used to			
obtain this sacred raksha sutra from their gurus			
 purohits or other Brahmins before going out to the			
battle fields 			
Gradually it became an annual ritual and then a public			
festival 			
Even today a purohit can be heard chanting			
 yen badhwa Bali raja danvendra mahabalaha ten twam			
manbadrami rakshe ma chal ma chal 			
Which means I tie you with the sacred thread with which			
 daitya raj Bali was tied by his guru 			
your protection may be sure and firm 			
Well there goes another story that when the demons			
attacked Indira's kingdom he prepared to fight them out 			
Before he set out his queen Shachi put the sacred 			
tilak on his forehead and the sacred thread the 			
raksha sutra or rakhi on his right wrist 			
which made Indra unconquerable on the battle field 			
Even during the Rajput period history tells us wives used			
to send off their husbands to the battle fields in the same manner after			
tying the raksha sutra to their wrists 			
Subsequently we do not know exactly when and how sisters			
started tying this sacred raksha bandhan around their			
brothers wrists 			
And the whole thing got converted into the modern festival of			
 raksha bandhan 			
Despite these changes in the form of the ritual the			
importance of the sacred thread has stayed 			
This thread has always been reminding man whether a			
 gurus deciple or sisters brother or wives gallant			
husband or any other common man of his obligations 			
Even people from outside Indian context have been influenced			
by the holy feelings inspired by this sacred thread 			
When Alexander came to India he perchanced saw an Indian woman			
 offering a sacred thread to a river on this particular day 			
Surprised when he asked her what she had done and when she told			
him the significance of this ritual he requested the woman to tie the			
 sutra to his wrist also 			
And she gladly did so 			
Similarly the great mughal emperor Humayun stood against the			
muslim ruler of Gujarat in order to protect Karmavati the queen of			
Chittor who sent the raksha sutra or rakhi			
 to him and requested him to protect his sister 			
In fact this festival of raksha bandhan has			
been a unique Indian tradition cutting across all the ages and all			
the sections of the Indian society 			
Any man feels proud of the holy thread his sister puts on his			
wrist and does everything within his power to protect her honour 			
In the present context the thread puts the burden of the			
sisters protection on the brother 			
In this way raksha bandhan has acquired a new			
social meaning and a new social purpose 			
But the tradition goes on and on restoring a gleam of			
fresh love and assurance in the eyes of brothers and sisters on			
this unique day 			
Some time ago I saw in some friend's house I			
don't remember now in whose I am the master of this house and I			
have my wife's permission to say so 			
To my mind the statement is has acquired			
the value of a powerful platitude 			
All the honourable members of the fraternity of the henpecked			
 would probably assert that a married man can do anything he likes			
 if his wife doesn't mind it because freedom is compulsory for him			
He must enjoy this freedom when his mistress is favourably			
inclined after all the labours of love and household 			
After all as Arnold Banard declared long ago being a husband			
is a whole time job and as per the globally accepted labour laws 			
every worker is entitled to personal freedom and entertainment 			
Of course without any detrement to his marital duties of all sorts			
What he says is also occasionally listened to and honoured by his			
wife who is very gifted that is young and beautiful 			
He has no cause to mourn if she sometime discards his proposals			
or even dictates 			
Isn't she his better-half obviously therefore she often gets			
better of him and his arguments 			
Thus what she hits becomes history and whatever she			
misses remains mystery 			
She frankly admits that there are two sides to every question			
 her own and the wrong side 			
Precisely for this reason very often he proposes and she			
disposes 			
It is a matter of common knowledge that the greatest philosophers			
 poets administrators and rulers have seen the tyranny of their			
wives 			
Plato and Aristotle ruled the world in their own way but could			
seldom have their own way with their wives who believed that the			
road to success is sealed with women pushing their husbands along 			
Isn't their belief upheld by history ?			
Who made Kalidas one of the greatest poets and playrights of the			
world ?			
Who pushed Tulsi to the world of immortality and undying fame			
 ?			
Modern poets are not less obliged to their mistresses and wives for			
experiencing real pathos in life and then enriching their			
literary output with this ennobled sweet melancholy 			
 Fanny's no put into Keats' throat a number of			
sweetest songs that tell of saddest thought 			
I pity Dryden who couldn't realise how unjust he was when he			
suggested that he would be greatly relieved when the wife was gone 			
He suggested his epitaph for her grave 			
 Here lies my wife here let her lie now she is at			
rest and so am I 			
Even today such a sick exclamation can sometime be heard somewhere			
 but that's just unfair 			
Generals and great politicians are no exceptions to this general			
observation 			
One day when a grocer complained about Mrs Lincoln's burst			
of temper Mr Abraham Lincoln the great American President laid a			
comforting hand on the grocer's shoulder and murmured 			
Can you not stand for fifteen minutes what I have stood for fifteen years			
 			
Well President Lincoln knew The time heals all			
wounds 			
Although he had to ignore another significant fact in order to keep			
his cool The time also wounds all heals 			
This would explain Charles Haddons Pergent humble supplication 			
god save us all from wives who are angels in the			
street saints in the church and devils			
 at home 			
We must give them their due musn't we ?			
With sincere apologies to Oscar Wilde it can be said that the			
only way to get rid of a wife's callous rejection is to yield to			
it 			
All you need in this life in order to escape your wife's			
 summary rejection of your proposals is ignorance and confidence 			
You must drive out from your life all superstitions like			
science and medicines 			
As George Bernard Shaw would put it Because a woman			
cannot put up with these unhealthy things 			
A woman is like an empire in a way 			
She makes quick decisions never reverses them and doesn't			
think you are safe when you are out 			
In these things as in most others a woman's wit is			
often better than a man's arm and fate with her is often at			
his wit's end 			
It must not be however concluded that I am a misogynist 			
Far from it 			
Although some left balanced male thinkers describe a balanced			
woman as one with a narrow waist and a broad mind 			
I do not subcribe to this view 			
 It's true that in some parts of the world even today			
women do not enjoy as much lead of freedom as men do but women are not			
handicapped on account of this legal flaw 			
Thanks to the generosity of nature they are blessed with so			
much of irresistible natural power that no discriminatory laws can harm			
them 			
However there seems to be some gross misunderstanding among			
some misguided husbands who recently formed an association in New Delhi			
 to press for their deliverance from the tyrany of their wives 			
I don't understand this because wives in India hopefully 			
have not yet taken to husband battering 			
They do and probably justifiably so assert that an ideal wife would			
be any woman who has an ideal husband 			
This however raises a very feeble doubt in my mind that whoever			
it was who first called women the fair sex didn't			
know much about justice 			
I hope my wife isn't listening to me now 			
Sometimes my doubting nature drives me to think that any fool can			
have and hang the wisest man in the world and so any wife can			
drive even the most sensible husband to desperation by just using a			
disasterous word no 			
I think it will do everybody good to analyse the situations 			
in which she disposes as soon as he proposes 			
The wife's genius is the first factor that makes her avert			
to her husband's initiative 			
Do not therefore pity the unsuccessful lover of a women of genius			
Save your sympathy for the man who marries her because not			
before long all is real and imaginary weaknesses and failures puts spread			
in the world like wild fire 			
In such cases the brilliant wife may not only dispose but			
go to the extent of disposing him off 			
Nearly the same thing holds good about women who are uncommonly			
beautiful 			
Such a beautiful wife may not only come forward to edit her 			
poet husband's poem but may even venture to edit him personally			
An ugly duckling might not display such a fiendish talent and			
other invitation to a possible catastrophe may result from marrying a woman			
with relation of whom she would always boast 			
There may be extremely successful people in society because of			
their wealth power or excellences in some art 			
The wife would tend to pity her husband and pity herself 			
secretly but whenever an opportunity is is there she would			
spontaneously reprimand her husband directly or indirectly for being an			
inferior soul or lesser mortal 			
Finally the husband's indiscreet and total submission			
to his better half usually corrupts and converts her into his bitter			
half 			
The husband must realise that his wife is a shadow who			
will turn and run ahead of him never to be caught 			
If he runs after her but who will follow him tirelessly if			
he even pretend to move away from her 			
Anyway do not grieve friends if she still disposes as			
you are on the surest way to greatness 			
Behind every man with pull is a woman with a push but			
quite naturally he proposes and she disposes 			
Conversation with Dr Uma Chakravarty we have have			
 been trying to understand how history shaped by the selective			
interpretation of past events 			
This particularly has affected the representation of women in history			
In part one of the series Dr Chakravarty discussed the inherent biases			
in historical sources looking particularly at women in the Vedic and			
Buddhist periods 			
In the second part we went on to look at women in mythology and the			
epics 			
In the third we discussed the Bhakti tradition and the Medieval			
period 			
Today in our concluding session we would look at the representation of			
women at the turn of the century and soon after 			
Now uh coming to the nineteenth century and the			
Socio-religious Reform Movements that we see at that time uh would you			
like to comment on the context in which suddenly we so			
called woman question acquires prominence suddenly woman question is			
foregrounded what is the context in which this happen ?			
Well actually this is uh this is the question and this is			
an area which is com tied up completely with our uh the the			
rewriting of history 			
Uh the enterprise of uh writing history 			
Uh what you get in the nineteenth century is a uh a rather			
dramatic confrontation between two different cultures 			
Uh with what appears to be a visible difference in way 			
in which the colonial power uh structured its gender relations and			
the way in which the uh the colonised power uh had structured its			
gender relations			
And this is not a confrontation which is on an equilitarian			
basis but on clearly on an unequal basis 			
So what you get is uh the British as the conquerors uh			
 with their understanding of both of their own culture as well as of the			
culture that they are now uh exposed to 			
And the uh Indians who were reacting to uh a certain kind of			
construction of their culture being uh made by the colonial power 			
Now what is interesting is that the colonial power tends to look at			
this in two ways 			
One is to discuss what they consider to be a uhm you know the			
 the positive values of this the culture that they had come into			
confrontation with and a certain kind of uh uh recognition that this			
was uh an ancient culture with various defined rules and so on 			
And this more or less uhm coincided with the orientalist			
enterprise			
That is the orientalists who you know uhm translated the			
sanskrit text who uh who collected works who uh uhm you know			
discovered new works and so on			
And so there was a certain understanding about the past which			
began to be constructed			
But it was done clearly from the point of view of the uh of the			
British who needed to know these uh all these in terms of being			
better administrators 			
Simultaneously there was a fairly strong and noticeable			
reaction by the British uh which ended up in in in a sense			
condemning the culture that they had uhm uh come into uh contact with			
And this is done partly because uh it also would indicate the moral			
superiority of the conquerors and the and the legitimacy of their			
enterprise			
But at the same time it also ended up in uh making sweeping			
condemnations of the entire culture			
Now what happened during this period is to begin to identify			
the status of women with the civilisation as uh it it became the 			
uh index of a civilisation 			
So the status of women uh would then decide whether the			
civilisation was ha something that was valuable or not 			
And this is what happened during the nineteenth century			
Now it also tied in with the the understanding of a how one			
needed to reform the structure of relation 			
Uh what practice is needed to be uh stamped out or uh			
what kind of changes needed to be introduced 			
And uh here again there were two different ways in which you			
can look at it			
 There was there was the British uh view point 			
there was also uh development from within the uh Indians which			
was also similarly interested in certain degree of reform 			
There was for example a woman like Pandita Ramabai who was			
writing 			
Uh a little later uhm little later but early on			
for instance in the early uhm nineteenth century you have some uh			
 say the whole discussion of sati and the need to			
legislate on sati bringing forth the kind of literature			
that Rajaram Mohan Roy and his adversaries generated on the women's			
 question			
And here here the women's question became central 			
Because uh you and and the use of the text also became central			
because it was important to try and establish that several traditions			
were authentic certain were certain traditions had been interpolated			
So the reformers used the Shastras to indicate			
that uh certain practices were not there in the ancient hoary past			
This is the period in which the beginnings of the Vedic the			
construction of the Vedic uh period as a golden age for women actually			
 began			
Uhm			
Uh because it was important to try and say that at some point			
in the hoary past uh the status of women had been high			
That certain aberrations developed and that these needed to be			
stamped out 			
Uh at the same time the adversaries also used the Shastras			
 to state that the uh the practices were actually			
indigenous they were an inherent part of Indian tradition			
All this resulted in a tremendous historical consciousness being uh			
 generated or about the past in in which a lot of people were 			
 into uh involved uhm and 			
la later the nationalist came into the fray and			
they needed again to reconstruct the past along the lines that they			
wanted			
And they did this with a particular point from a particular point			
of view because they restructured gender relations but they also 			
 restructure restructured the images of men and women			
Means they created a uh uh a kind of a new man who 			
was vigorous who was uh dynamic who was not at all a an effete person 			
which is how the Britisher cast Indians 			
Uh uh effete emasculated kind of person but someone who was			
 uhm was strong who've who's marshall who was who			
was capable of uh the highest courage 			
And the Vedic period died after that because the Aryan uh was a			
militant marshall uh person 			
Simultaneously they did this the same thing for women so			
women got developed in two ways 			
Uh one was to look at women from the point of view of the uh uh 			
practices that they had be been familiar			
with			
So Gargi for instance and the episode of Gargi becomes very			
very important at this time one to say that women had should			
have access to learning now 			
And there was a debate raging on whether women should study or not			
 in Bengal 			
At the same time uh it did indicate the status in their			
minds of women in the past 			
And so one would get for instance a certain half baked half			
information			
For instance Gargi the Gargi narrative was always used			
to say that Gargi was learned she could debate Yagnavalka but they didn't			
complete the story			
And they wouldn't tell you that uh the debate had been on uhm			
 unfair grounds and had been terminated on unfair grounds			
That when uh Gargi uhm fixed uhm Yagnavalka with two			
subtle questions which he would not be able to handle and which he			
was not able to handle he simply said uhm shut up woman			
otherwise your head will fall off 			
And uh he ended the debate on that note			
Now the nationalist obviously could not bring the later part			
 because this would be a reflection on their ancient past 			
But in any case this kind of enterprise went on			
Simultaneously they also highlighted uh a certain 			
kshtriya values for women 			
And so they created new kind of men and a new kind of 			
wo womam 			
Now Ramabai uh interestingly didn't quite fit in with this			
whole reconstruction of the past 			
Uh Ramabai's was unusual because she was one of the few			
women who knew Sanskrit had been taught Sanskrit by her father uh in			
fact by her mother 			
Uh who then studied the the text and who obviously was not			
satisfied with the kind of answer that she found in her text 			
So that Ramabai became a little bit of an embarassment to 			
the uhm to atleast one section of the nationalist not to all of them			
Now Ramabai is is extremely important from our point of view			
Because if you if we were to say who's who's one uh			
 one of the first uh women to be perceptive about the uh status of			
women 			
Uh one of the first investigator as it were into the past as			
well as into the present would be Ramabai			
She travelled extensively but uh during one word 			
she was exposed to a number of practices and uh she uh evokes this in the			
text that she wrote which is called the High Caste Hindu Widow			
 			
Now here she talks about the low status of women 			
And she is really interesting because she turns the arguments			
of this both the uhm English and the nationalist in a sense a			
section of the nationalist uh wrong 			
Now whereas people had judged the uh index of civilisation			
 by the low status of women and this is what the British had done 			
Uh simultaneously someone like Dayananda had turned it around and			
he talked about the status of women being high in the Vedic period and			
therefore this in civilisation being uh fine			
Ramabai actually talks about psychological fear and she			
says that the reason why we are a subject nation is because if			
women are subject how can they produce sons who are not psychologically			
uh cowards 			
And so she turns the argument fully around			
Now hers is a really fascinating enterprise uh she uh was			
both reformist as well as knowledgable 			
And uh her handling of the women's question has a kind			
of sharpness and it it extraordinarily moving I mean uh for instance 			
uhm there is this marvellous passage that she had on the uh 			
completely unequal uh relations between men and women			
So she talks about the situation which pertains to a widow and			
the situation which obtains to a widower			
And she uses Manu			
She says Let her emi emaciate			
 her body by living on pure flowers roots and fruits but she			
must never ever mentioned the name of another man after her husband has			
died 			
Until death let her be patient of hardships self-control and			
chaste 			
Then she goes on and she says The rules for the widower			
 a twice born man versed in the sacred law shall burn a wife of the			
equal caste 			
And having at the funeral given sacred fires to his wife who			
dies before him he may marry again and again kindle the one word			
 fires 			
And the way she juxtoposes the two you know indicates the			
directness with which she is confronting the problem			
Here are a set of rules for men here are the certain 			
certain set of rules for women			
And the uh double standard of morality something that she			
exposes marvelously			
She does this as far as uh infanticide uh she in a sense			
she is one of the first recorders of statistics because she talks about			
female infanticide and so on			
So her experience is actually uh quite unique and is			
something that historians all historians uh should this you know			
should open themselves upto			
But certainly she is very important for rewriting history to			
include women 			
Uh in in an early conversation with you you had mentioned			
that Dayanand Saraswati has some very interesting things to say about women			
as mothers yeah would you like to talk about that ?			
 Yeah 			
Yes sure			
Uh well you know uhm Dayanand goes back to the Vedas			
for uh for uhm a lot of the uh kind of practices that he would			
now write like to bring back 			
So he he gives to women a very central role in uh creating			
a new race of heroes 			
Now in doing this he is able to simultaneously deal with the uh			
women as wife but also deal with the widow who is a 			
is a problem in nineteenth century and who is an embarassment to			
many of the reformers			
He uh brings back and he talks about the practice of 			
niyoga which is very interesting because niyoga			
 uh in the vedic time had been the possibilities of uh uh			
rearing a son for the dead husband uh by appointing somebody else in his			
place 			
Now this is a practice and uh lot has been made of 			
niyoga as a positive right that women had			
But uh uh in the Vedic period let's not make any uhm			
 let's not confuse the issue uh it remains a prerogative uh			
 which is available to the kinsmen of the household to ensure that			
reproduction uh is uh continues			
 It's it's the right to remarry or to co-habit but 			
under rules which uh which previleged men and the cultural norms that they			
would like to perpetuate			
Now Dayanand uses this 			
And he suggests that uh that uh widows can use 			
niyoga to have a series of son			
So he does that on the one the hand 			
But he also because of concern is very strongly for a a new race			
For a race of people who are strong and rigorous 			
He uses the biological power of women uh and regulates			
 for it 			
Now for instance he suggests that women uh must not uh 			
actually feed their own children because these should be handed to a			
wetnurse because a woman should return to uh uhm as quickly as			
possible to a situation where she can conceive at the time when she is 			
best equipped for it which is between the years of sixteen and say thirty			
or whatever or whatever which will which is the best time from the point			
of view of reproduction			
So he uhm he uses both traditional knowledge as well as			
medical knowledge to uh propose a set of rules which does at one			
level apparently raised the status of women but which in in a sense			
actually it is seeing women as stock breeders 			
Co-operation today is an economic system as a peaceful			
reaction against capitalistic economy which has resulted in the			
concentration of wealth mass poverty and decay of men 			
Indian co-operative movement is probably the strongest 			
and the oldest movement among developing countries 			
The co-operative movement has been in existance for more			
than eighty-five years and would be hundred years old soon 			
The movement was introduced with high hope and big			
expectation providing a solution to India's rural			
problem 			
All the committees from the times of Mr Nicolson to this day			
 have constantly emphasised that the co-operative sector is a			
fundamental solution to the ills of the rural economy in general and			
agricultural economy in particular 			
In the first few decades the movement was not a significant			
movement but after Independence due to government's 			
encouragement and the Reserve Bank's participation the			
movement began to spread 			
Since nineteen forty-seven the number of societies have			
increased from one point eight lakhs to about three			
point fifteen lakhs 			
And the total membership has also gone up from one point			
thirty-seven crore to fifteen crore 			
The co-operative sector has provided loan to the extent			
of eight thousand crore during eighty-nine ninety as			
against rupees six thousand crore 			
provided by the commercial banks 			
The development of Consumer Store and			
industrial co-operatives has also been significant 			
Thus the co-operative sector in India made a tremendous			
progress in various directions and has reached a stage when it can be			
said as an important factor in economic social and political			
development of India and has now become progressive and diversified			
National level statutory organizations like NABARD L T			
D C N D D have been set up to promote new co-operatives in India			
In nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight the co-operatives			
attended further heights 			
Agricultural credit disbursed was around rupees			
 three thousand five hundred crore and the value			
of the credit marketed was around rupees five thousand			
 crore 			
The co-operatives distributed forty lakh 			
tonnes of fertilizers amounting three thousand five hundred 			
crore rupees and the co-operative sugar factories produced			
 fifty lakh tonnes of sugar in nineteen eighty-seven			
eighty-eight accounting sixty percent national production of			
sugar 			
Dairy development and processing co-operatives also show 			
similar progress 			
The experience of number of successful co-operative			
organizations like Amul in Gujarat Marksade in Punjab 			
Cooptex in Tamil Nadu Apco in Andhra sugar in Maharashtra 			
demonstrate that co-operative sector has needful energy to forge			
ahead 			
There is thus vast scope for development of organized			
marketing processing and export activities in the field of			
vegetables flowers horticultural products forest produce and			
such other things 			
Consumer Store if managed honestly and efficiently can			
provide services to millions 			
Important achievement during the Seventh Plan was a process of			
reorganization of primary society to viable unit 			
This process was complete in all the States except			
Maharashtra Gujarat and Jammu Kashmir 			
Another milestone was the establishment of NABARD in			
July nineteen eighty-two as an apex institution to handle all matters			
relating to planning policy and operation in the field of			
agriculture 			
The Seventh Plan also laid down great emphasis on			
development of professional manpower also 			
All these efforts brought economic social political			
 and educational benefits to the members of these societies 			
The economic benefits include Providing of cheap credit			
 rescuing of rural farmer from the clutches of money-lenders 			
better use of credit better prices to farmer product and better			
marketing facilities to industrial worker 			
On social side idle men became industrial 			
The spendthrift the thrifty the illiterate learnt reading			
 and some drunkard person reform their ways 			
In short co-operatives have become a tool of self 			
aggrendisement 			
Thus the co-operatives made great strides and influence			
 all spheres 			
However there seem to have crept in several distortions 			
on account of various reasons 			
Actually the movement was introduced to uplift the downtrodden			
 and the small farmer 			
But in this respect we find that the movement has certainly			
failed in achieving these objectives 			
 The rural credit survey committee has			
rightly observed that the slice of the co-operative finance was			
eaten by the big cultivator 			
Thirteen percent of the total household got sixty percent			
share of the loan while fifty-three percent household got eleven			
percent only 			
Mr C Subramaniam Governor of Maharashtra has rightly said 			
that the co-operatives have unfortunately not catered to the needs of the			
weaker classes 			
On the contrary the leaders and the vested interests 			
had plagued the co-operative sector thereby the committed honest			
workers are ousted and driven out 			
For the poor performance the number of causes are responsible			
 among them lassez faire policy illiteracy 			
very small sized societies undue reliance on honorary services 			
inefficiency in management and partial coverage of the life of the			
individual 			
Extrinsic factors include Widespread indebtedness 			
lack of business experience uneconomic holding price fluctuation 			
dearth of regulated market old methods of cultivation 			
Presently the co-operative banking sector faces the			
problems like overdue Shortage of resources indifferent			
management and the lack of efforts to mobilize deposits untrained			
staff and weak arrangement for linking credit with marketing 			
In India twenty-five percent of the societies or say 			
thirty-four thousand societies are defunct and dormant today 			
This shows that the co-operative movement in India is not			
uniformly developed 			
 There's marked regional disparity and unevenness			
 in the growth 			
In Maharashtra Punjab Tamil Nadu more than seventy			
percent rural population has come within the fold while in Bihar			
 West Bengal Assam and Orissa the coverage is below twenty			
percent 			
In Andhra the development is restricted to to Telangana			
 or Railseema 			
One of the most disquietning feature in co-operative sector is			
 incidence of increasing overdues 			
In Maharashtra alone overdues amount to rupees			
 two thousand four hundred crore in nineteen			
eighty-seven 			
In the past there were selfless and zealous workers who devoted			
their whole life as a mission 			
But today there is lack of dedicated leadership and lack of			
trained personnel also 			
The development is also hampered due to lack of			
inconsistant policy and rigid approach of the government 			
The formation of large sized society was rejected by the			
government without giving it a trial or a serious consideration 			
The defective loan policy also stood in a way of severe			
growth of the movement 			
In most cases the members of the society do not understand			
 exact aims and objectives of the co-operatives 			
The members therefore have become the clients of			
convenience 			
This has laid to all kinds of undesirable things in the			
management of the society 			
Viewed in totality our co-operative sector is not that			
impressive and overall image is that one of the major reasons for			
this is that all initiative comes from the government agencies 			
and not from the people 			
It thus has lost its basic character 			
Even today the movement is known as sarkari			
 movement and not the sahakari 			
There are several apex institutions which have no firm rule 			
and have a superstructure without infrastructure 			
There is also lack of inter-co-operative relationship both			
vertically and horizontally 			
The sector therefore cannot show its unified strength in the			
economy 			
There is absence of sectoral planning in co-operative sector 			
Federal units like N C D C NABARD NAFED do not pay 			
sufficient attention to the constituent units 			
 National co-operative policy resolution of nineteen			
seventy-seven relating to integreted approach has not yet been			
implemented 			
Absence of such a policy has major limitation which has created			
 several problems in working of the co-operative sector 			
There is thus an immediate need for a clear government policy			
 for the co-operatives 			
Now it is also quite necessary to incorporate role of			
co-operatives in Indian Constitution so that a			
clear prosperous future past could be defined 			
For the success of co-operatives three elements are necessary			
 A dedicated leadership professionally competent management			
 and enlighten membership 			
After all the co-operatives are owned by members and			
therefore members should know what they really expect from the			
co-operatives 			
Awareness among the members is very poor 			
There is lack of Free membership training and education			
also 			
Leaders also have no clarity about their role 			
As the members of the co-operatives or resource poor in			
India government provide finance but with some directives 			
Under such circumstances how to restore member confidence 			
is the highest challenge facing us 			
And as a first step in this regards the government will have to			
loosen its excessive control over the co-operatives 			
Recently the issue of activization of democratic process 			
coupled with promotion and professionalization of management was			
discussed in registrar's meeting on twenty-sixth August nineteen			
eighty-five 			
And according to recommendations Ardhanarishvaran			
committee was set up in March nineteen eighty-six 			
The committee in its recent report advised to restrain the			
tendency to abuse democratic rights in the co-operatives 			
Exclusive of one or two recommendations all other			
recommendations unless adopted expeditously the movement cannot go			
further 			
India is thus facing a number of challenges and in changing			
situations the role of co-operatives depend on how swiftly			
co-operatives adopt and reorient to these challenges 			
Fortunately in Seventh Plan adequate credit was made available			
to weaker section and less developed areas 			
In Maharashtra from the initial role of disbursement of credit in			
rural areas the co-operatives have diversified into several			
subsectors 			
Co-operatives now provide a full range of services to village			
level farmer in all respect 			
So all these are good changes yet hereafter the poor			
sections could be helped in income-generating 			
activities literacy programme village sanitation drinking water			
programme vocational training programme and community development			
activities 			
Hereafter these new co-operatives are to be organized for			
weaker sections 			
The members should be provided training in general management			
along with leadership development programmes 			
In short co-operatives should do something for the community			
and then only people will begin to identify as their own co-operatives			
 			
This is All India Radio Bombay 			
It is nine thirty 			
We shall now hear a talk entitled Random Thoughts			
 by Dr Usha Thakkar 			
Questions before us are baffling and issues around us are			
overwhelming 			
When I start thinking about them I get taken over by their			
variety and volume 			
And these different strands are woven together and the emerging			
picture becomes clear and grim 			
And I start wondering what is happening to us as individual			
 as society as a nation 			
Crisis seems to have penetrated everywhere 			
Is it political economic cultural or the crisis of life			
itself ?			
We see many young children begging on streets and working			
in dangerous conditions 			
We hear many incidents about young women being burnt for			
dowry 			
Innocent persons getting imprisoned in the trap of bonded			
labour 			
And the youth going astray due to lack of direction 			
We read about many massacres in cities and villages 			
We know many persons who exchange their ethics and ideals for			
money 			
We are aware of many cases of bribery and forgery 			
Our attention is often drawn to scandal in educational			
institutions the citadels of learning 			
And nothing happens to us 			
Have we lost our sensitivity the very core of human life ?			
We preach morality to children and we talk of values to all 			
but we do not hesitate in compromising when it comes to personal gain 			
We see nothing wrong in seeking personal favours for			
gratification 			
Is this in accordance with what we say ?			
And what impact is it going to have on the young generation who			
get bewildered and confused by this discrepancy between action and			
preaching 			
Corruption seems to have penetrated in all spheres of life 			
and worse then that it seems that we have accepted that it has come			
to stay 			
Work culture gets adversely affected by this 			
Demands for rights are put forward without due consideration to			
duties 			
Previleges are sought without fulfilling obligations 			
Consumerism and hedonism dominate our time 			
Pursuit of comfort mixes get oblivious of the means adopted for			
the same 			
The importance of money is accepted unchallenged 			
Everything starts getting measured in terms of money and then			
 values are turned in prices 			
People get to use Henry Millers' expression 			
 Protected by money learnt by money dulled by money 			
New inventions advance in technology and wonders of			
computers have certainly opened new vistas for human beings 			
But we'll not go in ahead without values and ideals 			
pushes into an age of despair and destruction 			
Emerson had said that The true test of civilization is 			
not the census not the size of cities nor the crops 			
No but the kind of man the country turns out 			
Unfortunately today we see men surrendering their ideals to			
expediency and yielding their sensitivity to the pressure of power 			
Respect for human value and constraints on human greed 			
and lust were never more important than they are today 			
Gandhi had pointed out that hankering after riches forces			
one to exploitation in some form or other 			
The modern civilization with its emphasis on materialism 			
and its basis of exploitation of the weak is equivalent to darkness and			
disease 			
True civilization consists not in accumulation of commodity 			
but in a deliberate and voluntary reduction of one 			
Politics bereft of religion is a death trap because it			
kills the soul 			
Unfortunately today we are at such junction in history where			
the line between good and evil often gets blurred and consequently			
the distinction between heroes and villains also often gets blurred 			
The practice of putting profits before prudence and the			
instinct of putting I before we 			
have eroded the foundation of human values 			
If humanity itself is lost would a human being be a human 			
or a mere robot ?			
In that case what about future ?			
One undoubtedly is in agreement which the Russian poet Andrei			
Muroyiv when he said that I am not interested in the twenty-first			
century if it will be only robots 			
It can happen but it will be death 			
We will be alive but dead 			
We start enumerating the advantages and gains profits and			
pay-offs and neglect human values and human emotions 			
We ignore the highways and start getting lost in lanes and			
by-lanes where paths become narrower and narrower 			
As a nation we are going through rough times 			
Nationalism often becomes synonym with factitious 			
politics and this gives boost to destabilizing and destructive forces			
Ugly forces of communalism fundamentalism regionalism 			
and terrorism rock the tranquility of the country 			
Instances of communal riots and political violence provide			
material for headlines to media 			
Events and happening in the field of politics indicate			
clearly that politics is the game of power 			
The game of ruthless strategies the game of selfish interest			
 where moral norms and high ideals are pushed aside and where			
credibility and accountability become meaningless words 			
Problem of poverty has assumed grave dimension due to illiteracy			
Basic needs of food shelter and clothing of the people have			
yet to be fulfilled 			
Rising prices inflation and unemployment bring			
unprecedented pressures on the common man 			
Today problems are many and solutions are not simple 			
We have to accept the fact that ours is a plural society 			
where diversity in religion caste community and language is			
overwhelming 			
This plurality cannot be hidden under the clock of concensus			
 nor can they be blinded branded as			
confrontation 			
Aspirations and grievances of various ethnic religious 			
linguistic and minority groups demand special attention to cultural			
ethos and recognition to diversity 			
As the noise over Masjid-Mandir 			
employment and social justice ethnic diversity and minority rights is			
getting louder law and order situation is worsening 			
The weak and the underprevileged sections of the society still			
suffer from discrimination 			
Here I would like to focus on the status of women 			
Even now after so many years of Independence women suffer			
problems of inequality and discrimination dependant and domination			
Some individual women have achieved stupendous success in some			
fields such as education and politics 			
The Constitution has granted equality and some progressive laws			
are enacted 			
But the majority of women are lost in the darkness of ignorance 			
The literacy rate among women is only thirty-nine point			
forty-two percent 			
The fact to remind that India is a nation where people			
belonging to different religions live and practice their own way of			
life 			
The Constitution did not establish a common civil code and the			
personal laws of different communities remain operative 			
It is unfortunate that in a democratic and secular state like			
ours all the women are not on equal footing 			
Women of different religions and communities suffer under			
oppressive personal laws 			
Traditional norms of behaviour and inequality have taken deep roots			
in our social system 			
Revival of religious fundamentalism intensifies the threat to			
 women's equality 			
It is sad to note that social evils like dedication of			
girls to temple polygamy and seclusion of women			
 have thrived in the name of religion 			
There are some laws which provide protection to women but			
the cunning and conniving do not take long to find the loop holes 			
Moreover the process is long painful and expensive 			
The question remains how many women would muster courage and			
resources to fight discrimination ?			
Bigamy is still not extinct 			
The provision regarding the age of marriage gets frequently			
violated 			
 Women's access to rights of property 			
maintenance inheritance divorce alimony and custody of children			
 get limited 			
Many laws lose their meaning in the absence of proper			
implementation 			
Though it is one of the duties of an Indian citizen to			
renounce all practices derogatory to the dignity of women women are			
often subjected to atrocity like grave or physical assault 			
Trade in human flesh is still prevalent 			
Rape victims suffer from tremendous trauma and damage to their			
personality 			
Crimes against women continue to rise 			
There were more than six thousand reported victims of rape in			
nineteen eighty-seven and more than fifteen hundred dowry deaths 			
including burning 			
The declining sex ratio is an issue causing grave concern 			
The nineteen ninetey-one census shows only nine hundred and			
twenty-nine women against thousand man 			
This is an issue not just of number but a pointer at our social			
reality 			
Neglect at every stage is the fate of the women 			
Survival itself becomes difficult as is evident from the misuse			
of the sex determination test 			
Age specific death rate indicate higher rates for female			
children and women upto thirty-five years of age 			
The discrimination against the women in economic arena still exist			
The provisions of labour laws and equal pay for equal work do			
not reach all women and provisions are not properly implemented 			
Almost ninety percent of women workers are engaged in			
unorganized sector 			
Studies clearly show that modernisation and mechanisation tend			
to marginalise women in many sectors 			
The fact remains that there cannot be division of women into			
groups of working women and non-working women 			
Women work but their work goes unnoticed 			
Invisible hands of women are always at work but the data			
system with respect to women's work is imperfect 			
Estimates of the average hours of unpaid work done by women			
 outside their homes vary from six to seven hours per day with some			
women working upto ten hours or more 			
Apart from the domestic duty women are engaged in agricultural			
operation for an average of twelve hours a day 			
They have to keep themselves and their families alive 			
In rural areas thirty to thirty-five percent of household 			
are headed by women still there access to ownership of land and			
property is negligible 			
Women find it extremely difficult to enter the male dominated			
field of politics 			
The crucial fact is that women find themselves being judged			
 and often judging themselves by two different standards 			
One standard is of traditional role of the private world which			
regards her as homebound nurturing submissive and emotional 			
The other standard is of her changed role in the public world			
 which expects her to be ambitious rational progressive and			
competetive 			
This private public divide bring severe pressures on her 			
Other deterrants in her way are approach of political parties			
 prohibitive election expenses demands of home and family and			
fear of character assassination 			
Still we have a long way to go 			
Democratic notions of equality and liberty have to percolate			
in her day-to-day life 			
Journey of democracy is never static or uneventful 			
Today realities are hard and challenges are tough but we the			
people of India have to give a positive response 			
Professor Jahagirdar sound of bell has been			
extremely kind to me I can thank him without deserving			
 for my work 			
My friend Ashok has given me the right treatment 			
Uh before you start your day's work in the morning			
 you have to catch your oxen and then you must put the			
 ropes through their nose and then get on with the day's			
 jobs 			
Which he has done for me cough 			
The other reason why I feel I do not deserve to be standing			
here and giving a public lecture is quite obvious clearing			
his throat 			
As you can see the lecture is not meant for people like me 			
uhm I can't keep my papers on and then read uh is meant for people			
who are normal clearing his throat 			
I am somewhat different from normal but I'll 			
do what I think needs to be done because the subject on which I			
wish to speak has become if not here in many other places in the			
country and awfully important question 			
As you have come here uh uh forsaking your lunch hour I			
will not take more time to uh tell you how I do not deserve to			
be here but get on with it now that I am here 			
Dear panel students 			
By way of introduction to my talk today I must explain two 			
ground facts 			
One which is pervasive throughout non-metropolitant India			
The other which is threatening to change the foundation of			
English teaching or rather to do kar seva with			
it that is to say to destroy it completely In itself may not be			
a bad thing at all			
I don't mind if English is destroyed the worst thing that will			
happen is I'll lose my job 			
I think I can find another one somewhere 			
The first uh let me say that my talk does not concerned university			
level study alone but also the basic levels of English teaching			
 and learning at the High School Junior College and College level			
 as well 			
Now what are these two threats that I spoke of 			
The first one comes from the non- teaching of the English			
School and college teachers generally and even some			
university teachers actually do not teach English 			
What is that they do can be given other names 			
But instead the students don't learn English 			
I shall mention only one perhaps the central reason that			
they do not know English 			
Anyhow the result is that they begin to justify and			
rationalize their failure by arguing that we really do not know			
English 			
English that it is a hang over from the colonial British			
Raj that we must really attend to our regional language or			
mother tongue 			
Now these are destruction tactics because those who wish to			
honour their mother tongue have always learnt it under any			
circumstances 			
More of that a little later 			
The second threat more recent powerful because its			
exponents have generally have the advantage of English medium urban			
education 			
And also because their arguments come from abroad in			
very sophisticated and precise words 			
These people argue as though we have not have any Tilak 			
Chiplunkar Phule or Karmveer that to study English is to			
continue English or British colonization 			
That if we study English because of any reason whatever we			
become post-colonially colonized 			
And besides they also speak in the same way of the means to			
engage in culture studies but deny the simple and obvious fact 			
that the greatest single repository of culture is its literature			
Therefore they argue that we should not study English literature			
 but only Indo- English literature 			
That we should not study English literature but local and			
world literature 			
They attempt to convert English Departments into cultural 			
study's department or departments of world literature 			
Is there anything seriously wrong with these two threats ?			
Can we do both English studies and Indian studies if we			
wish to ?			
History tells us most emphatically yes 			
There are persons in my own audience here today who have done			
this 			
Therefore on the excuse of looking at one such teacher on			
English Ayyappa Panikar from Kerala who has both studied and taught			
English well and worked effectively in his own mother tongue 			
I propose to examine the basic problems involved in being			
uncertain regarding whether to study and teach English or not 			
That is why my title To be uh to English or not to			
English the lesson of Ayyappa Panikar 			
English in India it appears is in a crisis 			
It appears to be insecure to observers of the linguistic 			
political arena as also to those in the academic arena which 			
some academia is also another linguistic political arena as though			
 we did not always know it 			
At least one State in India Uttar Pradesh seems openly at			
war with English 			
An International Congress of Marathi recently made a great			
deal of noise about the continuing hegemony of English in Maharashtra			
Without any hesitation however it needs to be said that either			
there is no real crisis but that one is being conjured up for			
ideological game by ideologues 			
Or that it is essentially the same old pre-Independence crisis			
 which is hoped to have stoped with Independence 			
More than four whole decades have past since the crucial			
achievement I mean Independance of an essentially older			
generation 			
To be found still harping on the same crisis in the belief that			
it still exists unchanged or in the hope that from keeping it			
alive will approve linguistic political or academic and			
political merit seems backward looking if not one word 			
And at least for that reason unjustified and unjustifiable			
for a nation that hopes to march through centuries of backlog of			
development not my word in the space of a very few Five Years Plans			
Mixed up in this crisis scenerio is a conscience crisis or			
what is at least made to look like it 			
Some in English teaching establishments are saying Why			
should they be teaching English literature why not our own for			
instance why should be the departments be called departments of			
English and not departments of literature 			
There are also those who would like to keep reminding us that			
English in India today is a matter of post-colonial colonization 			
Regarding the first sort of question we may answer first			
 that if other literatures need to be stu 			
taught or study they can be taught without teaching them in the			
English department 			
To wish to teach other literatures in English department and I			
mean other language literatures Marathi Hindi Telugu Malyalam imply			
some great confusion regarding the function of English in India 			
Second there seems to be no reason to deny that India does			
not need so many departments of English literature 			
Third there is nothing sound of bell 			
Third there is nothing more colonial in teaching English 			
British American Commonwealth included in a department of			
English than in teaching Hindi literature in a department of Hindi			
 or Organic Chemistry in a department of Organic Chemistry 			
As for the more fundamental question Why English at all			
 ?			
If anyone feels deeply that their career in English language			
or literature teaching is either empty patriotic or a super-			
colonial betrayal they can atleast by way of that career to 			
take up some less renegade or more self-respectful career 			
This is not to dismiss struggling consciences but to place			
them on par with other such 			
To take just one parallel instance 			
Those who feel that western medicine is a betrayal of 			
Ayurveda in the same way such Allopath should give up			
western medicine and trained train in 			
Ayurveda or another career 			
I would like to leave such cases behind right at the outset by			
saying that unskilled assessment will help avoid 			
schizophrenia 			
Further is To English or not to English			
 that seems to be the question 			
For anything between means waste through confusion 			
Let us take another look at this crisis or dilemma even though			
we settle the question once and the reasons for doing so have not			
changed since then 			
What is this crisis politically ?			
How long shall we if we shall let this English language			
continue as the major link language of the country ?			
When will Hindi take over ?			
No one seems to be in right mood to ask Why should 			
Hindi take over or what if Hindi takes over as a link			
language of our national life ?			
What shall we do about our international life ?			
Which whether we like it or not does endanger those subtle			
and growth way on our national life 			
What is the crisis ideologically are we ? 			
Apparently it's a rhetorical question to being or to			
 to be or to to continue to be colonized by the language or rather			
earlier colonial rulers 			
But that reaction is a feeling known 			
And indeed to such a question that should be our answer 			
But ideological arguments in this connection come in English			
 mostly addressd to English users 			
And what is complicating if not worst they seem to come in			
English via Europe and America 			
At least for me after such knowledge what forgiveness in			
any case this agrument also seems just like the political argument to			
fail to address the very practical problem before us or before the nation			
If not English then what ?			
For the English teaching establishments the apparently active			
English departments in the university but by implication of the passive			
departments in colleges and schools			
What is the crisis ?			
In simple terms people are asking again and again and			
again Ought we to be teaching studying Engish 			
 I've already tried to indicate my answer to that 			
If our aim is taken for granted when then this amongsts to			
among other things distraction confusion waste of time and effort and			
eventually a most horandous shortfall in our achievement of the goals we			
have set for ourselves in this regard 			
Should we not ask such a fundamental question ?			
Obviously we may and we shall 			
But whether we ignore its practical implications is the issue			
for me 			
And assuming that our nation has affirmatively answer the			
question already I would like to emphasis that we ought not to allow			
confusion or distraction to affect adversly our performance of the task			
Now as a democracy let us have admited right away we might			
well claim the right to reopen the issue 			
Take away the assumption create the condition that our			
previous decision need not be considered our fate accompli			
 			
But as long as we do not do so with full awareness of			
consequences we have better not do anything that will foster or			
enhance the downward trend in achievement of the task 			
Not as a negative implication 			
What must we do if we do decide not to teach or learn English			
any more ?			
Well we must then decide what we shall do 			
I see only three alternatives 			
Alternative one Shall we teach the rest of the world			
an Indian language 			
Even say if you like Hindi 			
So that we may converse with them or in all ways that			
international and therefore national life demands 			
Alternative two Shall we try to live our national			
international life without English and without any replacement for it			
 			
And three Or shall we choose an alternative language			
 another international language like German Russian French or Japanese			
 or another of our very own choice in which to conduct our			
international business 			
If we choose the first alternative fine 			
Let us girdle our loins for the task of the next couple of hundred			
years or so in which we must become internationally so important that			
outsiders wish to learn Hindi 			
Then arrrange a one word like programme all over			
the world or a Hindi Council to rival the British Council 			
Find in other words the ways and means to install Hindi as our			
international language which we can then continue to use 			
Lessons of the last four decades or so right here in India 			
ought to teach us what the real response to this questions should be 			
If we choose the second alternative not to bother with any			
international language we shall either create an Indian culture and			
nation precisely given the cultural linguistic diversity in India			
 it may not be quite so bad 			
We have a very rich culture or we shall be subject to so			
obviously to all sorts of threats of new colonization from many many sources			
 have had 			
That is to say even if we could imagine situation of international			
linguistic vacuum for India how long we may be able to sustain our			
integrity and even our sovereignity ?			
In a fiercly international world this is not in a moot			
query 			
The answer is too depressing to contemplate especially I hope			
it is depressing to those who feel the wealth of previous colonization			
feeling even today 			
Suppose we take the third alternative to switch to another			
language than English 			
A language not tainted by colonial oppressive past for us			
By the way is there a major language anywhere that is not			
tainted by a colonial oppressive past ?			
This question is just as revealing in the past tense and apply			
to languages like Sanskrit or Telugu or Marathi 			
What will that decision entail ?			
Dismantling all our international and also related national			
business and activity that depends on English today 			
Dismantling our machinery for proliferation of English 			
preparing for and installing in its place the entire machinery required			
 in the process of teaching and learning that new international			
language

I have no doubt that the training they have received and			
the traditions they have imbibed in this university will serve them			
well in facing the challenges of life hereafter 			
Friends I believe that the future belongs to the young			
The future of India is in the youth of India 			
I have great faith in the youth of India 			
Youth which has ideals which has vision and which is			
not being corrupted by the curse of consumerism or the malady of			
materialism 			
Preservation of democracy and democratic values and protection			
and promotion of human rights are matters with which everyone of us not			
merely lawyers and judges and journalists everyone of us is or should be			
concerned 			
It is the legitimate pride of every Indian and I feel that			
pride when I go abroad and an uh attend international conferences 			
and conventions that despite the trials turmoils and tribulations			
 which our nation has undergone democracy the rule of law 			
and respect for human rights by and large are preserved and respected in			
our country 			
And I think that is something about which every Indian should			
feel proud of 			
The topic of my address is The role of lawyers and the			
judiciary in upholding the constitution democracy and human rights 			
Now the problems the perennial problem of orderly			
government were perceptively discerned about two centuries ago by Madison			
 who was one of the founding fathers of the American Constitution 			
He stated in the Federalist and I quote In			
framing a government which is to be administered by men over men 			
the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government			
to control the governed and in the next place oblige the government to			
control itself 			
Over the years experiences demonstrated that governments are not			
obliging and do not control themselves 			
The great difficulty mentioned by Madison confronts our country in			
a large measure as we try to ensure fundamental freedoms and elementary			
decencies to all persons whilst respecting the rule of law and the			
independence of the judiciary 			
Despite the law's horrendous delays and a multitude			
of deficiencies which plague the Indian legal system it is curious 			
but also heartening that the public still retains confidence in the			
judiciary 			
It is to the judiciary that the citizens turn for protection from			
legislative excesses and executive abuses and for vindication of his			
or her rights against the State 			
An independant judiciary is one of the pillars of our			
constitutional edifice and is indispensible to a democracy 			
It is a constitutional and a moral imperative for the			
protection of human rights of the citizens for maintenance of the rule			
of law and for preservation of democratic values 			
And the essence of independence of judges is there is			
adjudication of disputes between citizens and between citizens and the			
State and the State is the biggest litigant today judges must act			
impartially and be free from pressure or influence of any kind 			
emanating from any source 			
What kind of persons did our founding fathers visualised for			
the high judicial office?			
Pandit Nehru spoke for all of them when he said and I quote			
 Judges should be not only first rate but should be			
acknowledged to be first rate in the country and of the highest			
integrity 			
And if necessary people who can stand up against the executive			
government and whoever may come in their way 			
Now in order to ensure the independence of the higher judiciary			
 our Constitution provides for security of tenure namely sixty-two			
years in the case of High Court judge and sixty-five years in the case			
of a Supreme Court judge 			
Frankly I have not been able to understand this sixty-two and			
sixty-five 			
I don't think there is anything in the High Court wherby at			
sixty-two the judge become one word and at sixty-five the Supreme			
Court judges still go on but that's another thing 			
Judges as you know cannot be removed at the pleasure of the			
executive but only by a procedure provided in the Constitution which is			
popularly known or called the process of impeachment 			
Remuneration of the judges is guaranteed by the constitution cannot			
be altered by the government of the day except by constitutional			
amendment 			
So these are the main bulwarks to insulate judges from			
executive pressure and to relieve them from being dependent on the			
government 			
But executive influences operate in a variety of subtle ways			
For example the prospect of appointment after retirement to			
some statutory body or council or commission and sometimes the			
prospect of the office of the governor 			
It is my view that the Supreme Court and High Court			
judges after retirement should not be given any assignment nor			
appointed to any body or tribunal which is subordinate to the High Court			
or the Supreme Court 			
It is an unseemly sight to witness legal challenges to the			
orders of former Supreme Court judges in the High Court or in the Supreme			
Court 			
The proper course is to give full pension to judges on retirement			
 and to avail of their services today they don't even get full			
pension they get only half pension 			
And to avail of their services in national interest for			
example heading a commission of enquiry in a matter of vital national			
importance as and when the occasion arises 			
It is also my view that the present retirement age of the High			
Court and Supreme Court judges needs to be increased so that the			
experience and abilities of the serving judges may be utilised 			
rather than lose them at the early age of sixty-two and sixty-five 			
In most countries following the common law tradition the usual			
retirement age is seventy years 			
Friends I do not desire to list all the qualities a judge			
should possess 			
But the foremost quality required in deciding constitutional			
issues is that the judge must be attuned to the philosophy of our			
 philosophy of our constitution which is succinctly and			
admirably encapsulated in the Preamble and amplified in the chapter on			
 Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles which			
taken together constitute the core and conscience of our Constitution			
We may and should should seek lights from judgements of			
the courts in the United Kingdom in the United States Canada 			
Australia New Zealand South Africa another developing country			
It is important to have exposure to judgements of national			
courts of other country as also the judgements of regional and			
international tribunals and understand their approach to the			
solution of problems specially in the field of human rights 			
But ultimately we have to work out our own constitutional salvation			
in the light of our historical background recording broken 			
independence is that the judge must judge must be independent			
of himself or herself 			
In other words in deciding cases the judges should consciously			
avoid being influenced by the preconceived notions 			
It is a difficult task 			
Have judges maintained the cold neutrality of an impartial			
judge as was Edmund Burke's perception? 			
Let us be realistic judges like you and me are human beings			
 cannot expect them overnight to completely shed their predilections			
and preconceptions 			
The individual tone of the mind the colour of past experience			
 the character and variety of interests the socio-economic			
background of the judge inevitably play a role in the decision making			
process 			
Our great Chief Justice Patanjali Shastri frankly acknowledged 			
that It is inevitable that the so called social philosophy and			
the scale of values of the judges should play an important part 			
At the same time he recognised that The constitution is			
not meant only for the people of their way of thinking but for all			
 			
Now there have been occasions no doubts when judges have			
read their preferences into statutory and constitutional provision 			
For example the judgement of Chief Justice S. R. Das 			
declaring gambling as an immoral trade beyond the pale of constitutional			
protection 			
Justice Kapur's view that certain advertisements for			
sexual disorders were not protected by the fundamental rights of free speech			
And Justice Hidayatullah's decision I have never			
understood that that Lady Chatterley's Lover			
 was obscene 			
All reflects of social and moral philosophy of these judges 			
Strong views for the rights of labour certainly influenced the			
decisions of Justice Gajendragadkar in the field of industrial law 			
Justice D. A. Desa's inveterate belief that landlords			
were a rapacious lots and all tenants deserved the courts utmost			
solicitude was transparent in his judgements 			
But it can be safely affirmed that in the overwhelming			
majority of cases judges in India have not acted as knight-errants			
 on white chargers in quest of their individual notions of justice 			
Cases are decided as if the parties before them were anonymous 			
and the issues are legal and constitutional 			
Judges as a rule do not intentionally take a view against their			
conscience or their oath nor do they take any cue from the sentiments of			
the ruling party 			
By and large judges do make a conscientious effort to			
neutralise their personal beliefs and predilections 			
If a law prohibiting consumption of alcohol is challenged the			
court is not concerned with the wisdom of the policy underlying the			
legislation 			
And it cannot invalidate the law because in its opinion the			
evil of drink cannot be effectively tackled by legislation 			
Again when legislation involving nationalisation of road transport			
 is challenged in fact was challenged the individual notions of			
the Justices over the policy of nationalisation are irrelevant in			
deciding whether there has been breach of any constitutional provision			
The decision of the Supreme Court in the bank nationalisation case			
 is frequently cited as an instance of the court striking down the			
legislation because of its disapproval of the policy underlying it 			
I am afraid what is overlooked is in the criticism of this			
much maligned judgement is that the Supreme Court rejected the			
basic and formidable argument that nationalisation of banks was not in			
the public interest 			
They said it is not for the Supreme Court to go into that they			
upheld that but court ruled that certain provisions of the Act 			
did not provide compensation as required under the then constitutional			
provision 			
Consequence was that these provisions were amended and			
nationalisation of banks was effectuated 			
The general judicial attitude is aptly and correctly summed up			
 in the classic statement of Justice Vivian Bose in a case of			
preventive detention of certain communists 			
Now mind you he gave a dissenting judgement in which he 			
quashed the orders of detention of the communists 			
But the statement which I want to read in which I which I would			
like to read is this and this was Justice Bose then It is			
perhaps ironical that I should struggle to oppose this freedoms in			
favour of a class of person who if rumour is to be accredited and if			
the list of their activities furnished to us is a true guide would be			
the first to destroy them if they but had the power 			
But I cannot allow personal predilections to sway my			
judgement of the Constitution 			
Now let me come to another subject 			
Is there any antithesis between democracy and an independent			
judiciary? 			
Is judicial review-on undemocratic? 			
Does judicial invalidation of laws thwart the will of the people?			
Although it is necessary to remove certain view you hear this very			
often 			
I think it's necessary to remove certain			
misconception about the role of the judiciary in our constitutional			
scheme 			
One of the essential features of our Constitution is division of			
power between different institutions namely the three wings of the State			
The Parliament and the State legislature the Executive and the			
Judiciary 			
A central feature of our Constitution flowing from the division			
of powers is that of a limited government 			
Consequently no authority or branch of the State can have absolute			
power 			
Moreover the limits of power cannot be determined by the limited			
power itself 			
Since our Constitution divides power between different organs 			
and prescribes limitations of the powers of Parliament the State legislature			
and the Executive it is imperative that there should be an impartial			
umpire in the shape of an independent judiciary to resolve the			
inevitable disputes over the boundaries of the constitutional power which			
arise in the process of government 			
And please remember that our Constitution has guaranteed			
certain fundamental rights and has expressly provided that any law			
or executive action which abridges any fundamental right is void 			
The fundamental rights constitute a limitation on the powers			
of Parliament and the State legislatures and the executive and the			
question whether any legislation or executive action is violative of any			
fundamental right has to be decided by some independent body 			
Kate Chopin's The Awakening Sex-role			
Liberation or Sexual Liberation 			
Over the centuries women writers have written openly or implicitly			
about the right of woman to passion 			
In fact as Ellen Moers in her Literary Women 			
says it was Ovid who with his with his Heroides 			
first gave voice to the heroine in love 			
According to Moers Ovid started a tradition which extended well			
into the eighteenth century to become part of the infant novel in Britain 			
and which was born anew in women's literature of the nineteenth			
century 			
Mary Wollstonecraft the strong-minded feminist comes to mind in			
this respect 			
For it is in her fiction reviews and letters that 			
Wollstone Wollstonecraft is explicit about love			
 The Wrongs of Women or Maria			
 by Wollstonecraft is a celebration of an unhappy wife's 			
 adulterous love from the point of view of a woman not only with a			
mind but a body capable of passion 			
Women writers also inherited from Rousseau the novel of adultery 			
as seen from the woman's point of view 			
As Moers put it I quote The adultery novel after			
Rousseau became the woman writer's vehicle of attack on the economic			
and social class realities that make a mockery of love as well as a			
vehicle of demonstration that woman has a capacity to think feel and act			
for herself unquote 			
A whole host of writers and novelists spoke frankly about the			
positive consequences of adultery 			
George Elliot the Bronte sisters Gaskell Browning Collette and			
Woolf to name only the most well known ones resolved to talk openly			
about the forbidden subject and the right of a woman to participate			
actively and consciously in the affairs of love clears her			
throat 			
The American literary scene had not witnessed the presence of a			
traditon of novel writing by women who talk about their heroines from a			
 woman's perspective 			
The awakening of female novel writers to a sense of their own			
identity begins only with the publication of Kate Chopin's 			
 The Awakening at the turn of the last century 			
One may even say that the American that the tradition			
begins in the twentieth century 			
Incidentaly The Awakening may be read as an			
 adult adultery novel also 			
 Chopin's novel sent waves of shock among the			
pre-dominantly patriarchal set up of her time 			
She became almost the first woman writer to create a woman in Edna			
 Pontellier who not only awakens to her sexuality but makes bold to			
confess it 			
Linda Huf puts it succinctly I quote The novel 			
suggested that the renegade heroine had not forgotten herself but had			
in fact found herself had awakened to her full potential as a human			
being and all because without consulting any one but her own			
willful self she had taken un an unlawful			
 fancy to a younger man unquote 			
When the novel opens the twenty-eight year old Edna Pontellier is			
holidaying at Grand Isle with her husband Leonce Pontellier and her			
 two children Raoul and and Etienne 			
I am sorry I don't know how to pronounce the French words so I am			
 I am just talking in terms of the Anglicised pronunciation 			
Pontellier a successful brokerage businessman is one of those			
husbands who prides himself on his many possessions of which his wife is			
the most precious and attractive 			
Little wonder that he reacts typically when he reprimands Edna for			
exposing herself at midday in such heat while bathing in the sea 			
He is anxious that she should protect her complexion as			
jealously if not more as her honour 			
He scrutinizes her as he would a piece of personal property which			
has suffered some damage 			
During the six years of her married life Edna too has lived like			
any other Southern wife in her beautiful house in New Orleans 			
immersed immersed in her home and social circle 			
She was married she sorry she has married Pontellier			
for the same reason as any woman of her class would 			
She chooses Leonce to become the devoted wife of a man who she			
felt worshiped her 			
She feels she would I quote Take her place with a			
certain dignity in the world of reality closing the portals forever			
behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams unquote 			
The opening pages of the novel would give one the impression that			
Edna is one of those usual Southern women who is contented looking after			
her husband and children 			
Yet through the flashback technique Chopin employs we			
know that Edna had been a different person in her childhood girlhood 			
and youth 			
As a lonely and imaginative person she has given herself to secret			
and intense infatuations 			
First it is the dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer at			
another time it is I quote the young gentleman who visits a lady on a			
neighbourhood plantation unquote			
Yet a third time it is I quote the figure of a great			
tragedian that possessed her mind 			
But marriage with the tragedian which would have been the highest			
point of her happiness was not for her in this world 			
However if he does not come in the form of a Leonce he			
comes in the form of Robert Lebrun who awakens her to a sense of herself			
as a person rather than as a piece of personal property 			
But even before Robert begins to arouse Edna's dormant			
passionate self it is the sea at Grand Isle which without her			
realising it has begun to exert a powerful pull towards her 			
The seductive voice of the sea never ceasing whispering 			
clamouring murmuring invites Edna's soul to wander the			
abyss of solitude 			
The solitude of the Sea as Judith Fryer aptly says propels a			
real awakening in Edna which I quote frees her from her place in			
society unquote 			
Fryer further maintains that in her illumination Edna is most			
like Whitman's Awakened self and that			
once we recognize the extent to which Edna's awakening is the			
Whitmanian song of herself the radical nature of Chopin's 			
intentions becomes clear 			
Fryer considers The awakening as a song a			
celebration of a woman who awakens to her identity as a person quote			
 defined only in terms of her own experience not in relation			
to any other person unquote 			
Among the many images that Chopin uses to project either Edna's			
 restrictive life or her freedom from this life the Sea is the			
most dominant one 			
It frames both Edna's awakening into life and her final			
suicide 			
The first six chapters of the book describe the seductive			
quality of the Sea which stirs Edna's awakening 			
So seductive is the pull of the sea that Edna experiences 			
contradictory emotions of attraction and resistance to Robert's 			
invitation to her to follow him to the shore or into the Sea 			
I quote this is from the text A certain light was			
beginning to dawn within her the light which's showing the way			
 forbids it 			
In short Mrs Pontellier was beginning to realize her position			
in the universe as a human being and to recognise her relations as an			
individual to the world within and about her unquote 			
That Edna's awakening is clearly sexual is indicated by			
 Chopin's description of the Sea and its effect on Edna 			
The touch of the Sea is sensuous enfolding the body in its soft			
 close embrace 			
When Edna first arrives at Grand Isle she cannot swim the Sea			
is dangerous to her 			
Quote A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when			
in the water unless there was a hand near by that might a hand			
near that might reach out and reassure her unquote 			
And of course it is Robert whose reassuring hand 			
encourage encourages her to realize her power to			
control her body and soul 			
 Chopin's aim is in describing Edna's trial in			
learning to swim is clear 			
It becomes symbolic of Edna's moving away from a state of			
dependence fear and repression to a state of independence 			
boldness and an awakening of a sensuous self 			
Edna wants to swim far wide where no woman has swum before 			
As a consequence her will gradually turns resistant and			
stubborn and eventually refuses to obey her husband's whims 			
Chopin juxtaposes Edna's emerging self with her previous			
dormant self to show how redundant her husband has become for her 			
Her bathing in the sea with Robert and her going on a day-long boat			
trip further shows Edna's boldness 			
Yet neither while bathing in the sea nor during their day at			
 Caminada do we see Edna and Robert in any kind of physical intimacy 			
In fact the high point of Edna's sensual awakening			
comes when Edna is alone at Madame uh Madame Antoine's 			
 co sorry cottage while Robert is waiting			
outside patiently for her to recover from her exhaustion after their boat			
ride to Caminada 			
More than Robert it is Adele one of the boarders at Grand			
Isle who seems to play a significant role in Edna's sensual			
awakening 			
It is Adele who em emboldens 			
Edna to exalt over her body without any shame 			
Chopin devotes considerable space to describing the intimacy with			
which the two women sit and talk on the beach at Grand Isle 			
Yet as long as Edna is on Grand Isle her awakening remains at			
the level of the sensual only 			
There is no element of sex involved in her relationship with Robert			
Before such a possibility arises Robert leaves for Mexico 			
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences vis-a-vis			
 Arobin comes much later			
This is a lover that she consciously takes in the in the novel			
it is shown that later in the novel 			
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences vis-a-vis			
 Arobin comes much later after she has emancipated herself 			
from her marital familial and social ties after her return to New			
Orleans 			
Edna has begun to defy her husband's whims even while they			
are at Grand Isle that is on the holiday 			
But in New Orleans where they live it's it's their			
home there she decides to free herself not only from her family duties			
but also from her social commitments like her weekly reception day 			
which she has had to observe to further her husband's business			
 and his status in society 			
She defiantly moves about alone at odd hours and in odd places 			
As if this was not enough she turns to her old hobby of painting			
 which at first she undertakes to kill the boredom of her life but			
later with a seriousness which eventually helps her helps her to			
handle her brush with a new sureness and ease helping her to work 			
to grow in force and individuality			
These are all textual quotes 			
The next step in Edna's emancipation is her desire to			
become economically independent which she becomes with the help of			
her teacher Laidpore who sells some of her paintings for her 			
This in addition to her small inheritance plus the money she			
has won at the race track makes it possible for her to buy her pigeon			
house			
She lives in a separate house from her husband's now			
Thus Edna awakens to her full identity as an individual 			
quietly but firmly freeing herself from the stereotypical roles of a wife			
and mother which society has imposed on her 			
An important influence on Edna in arousing her later creativity 			
which ultimately makes her a professional painter is Madame Reisz a			
pianist Edna has met at Grand Isle 			
Edna has been attracted by Reisz's professional			
performance that is soiree for the vacationers S O I R E E please how			
do we pronounce it ? 			
Soiree 			
Soiree okay 			
But more than this Edna has been fascinated by Reisz's 			
independence and her self-assertion and her tendency to trample on the			
rights of others 			
In New Orleans too Edna calls on Reisz quite often to hear her play			
The atmosphere of her room invades Edna with repose 			
 Reisz's music has the cons 			
consistent effect of playing upon the responsive chords of her			
inner being 			
Although Reisz's rudeness and offensive manners try 			
Edna's patience her divine art reaches Edna's spirit 			
and sets it free 			
Her observation that Reisz's observation in the text I			
quote To be an artist includes much one must possess many			
gifts which have not been acquired by one's own effort 			
To succeed the artist must possess the courageous soul 			
The soul that dares and defies unquote 			
Challenges Edna to further free herself from the shackles of			
social conventions 			
Probably it is Reisz's indifference and unconcern for			
social norms and conventions that emboldens Edna to confess what			
she has not been able to do to anyone her passion for Robert 			
It is then that Reisz says something that is at the centre of			
 Chopin's examination in the novel 			
I quote The bird that would soar above the level plain			
of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings 			
It is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings bruised 			
exhausted fluttering back to earth unquote 			
Obviousely through the bird imagery which like the imagery of			
the sea flows throughout the novel 			
Chopin is trying to portray the plight of women who either			
remain imprisoned in cages of conventions or tear these conventions of			
 and soar freely doing what they want to do or after having dared			
to defy and soar find the freedom so daunting that like weaklings 			
they fall on the land bruised and broken 			
Respected Chairman distinguished guests and fellow			
 delegates 			
I would like to say at the outset I'm very much			
illequipped paper reader 			
Actually I didn't I was not aware of the change in the			
schedule which was not really supplied to me yesterday I was one of			
the first paper Readers put down 			
But anyhow I am happy that I am able to read it read it out			
today 			
And taking into consideration the limitations of time usually in			
such seminars I have jotted down some stray thoughts that too			
on a known author well discussed by you 			
Of course I am not a committed feminist or anything like that but			
 based on my own reading I would like to share a few thoughts on			
Sylvia Plath's poem 			
Of course with a slight difference from the normally vaulted			
 past adpoted by most of the major voices 			
Uh the actually I struck upon this idea when I was			
reading Yung in some another context 			
And I had a feeling that uh perhaps uh Plath's 			
insistance struggle or some sort of an obssession with the definition			
or redefinition of self could be looked at from the complex concept			
of sex as sorry of the individual in which two polarities the			
male and female are combined 			
But anyhow I have not made a very deep analysis of that problem			
here 			
But on the other hand I have taken up a few poems and try to			
suggest why don't we look at this way and try to see a perhaps 			
another major concern of Plath rather than labelling her as an out			
and out feminist or a committed confessional poet or anything of			
that sort			
Perhaps I think one of the major problems which could still be			
studied in relation to her poetry is the integrity of the self			
 without being st strictly 			
related to any gender 			
Or the thrust of my paper which I have intend to elaborate			
later on is to see that the concept of the self which could be perhaps			
studied in relation to her poems could be quite free from the gender			
concerns 			
She takes into consideration the problems created by the male			
 as well as the female in defining a self intact 			
So with this introductory remarks I am reading my			
paper 			
The self in Sylvia Plath's plays it is different 			
In a very general sense Sylvia Plath's poetry as a			
whole has been an insistant search to find and define the self 			
Though she is often labelled as a confessional poet in her			
perception of the self and the poetic process she is quite different			
from say Dorothy Robert Loyal John Berryman and			
 Annie Saxon and the like 			
She links private motives and images into sequences that			
form the part of a coherent drama a symbolic enactment 			
The approach adopted by her in the last poem about which I			
am making some observations 			
The last poem contained An aerial 			
adventurous spirit throws in temporarily for highly individualistic and			
peculiar perception of the self 			
The victim sends feminist stance concessional strain 			
and the suicidal mania gain relevance and meaning when one should			
read to link these factors with her self or in other words herself			
 with a difference 			
 Plath's feminism her confessionalism and suicide are			
to be seen in relation to her relentless poetic transformation 			
An inevitable rebirth through death 			
A hightened awareness of the individuals painful one word 			
 in contemporary society becomes the central focus of			
their I mean contemporary poet's poems 			
 Plath's poetry of imit 			
 of initiation transformation thus appears within its			
general social framework as a means of escape from the identities and			
forces that imprisoned the self in America or perhaps elsewhere			
In the light of the developments in the post- nineteen sixty			
context there is some scope for looking at Plath's work 			
from a feminist point of view 			
This view centres upon her supposed victimisation by a			
male dominated world and her consequence feminist's stance			
Lack of recognition in a male dominated world shocking			
childhood experiences and the separation from her husband of			
course these are all autobiographical factors which may or may not be of			
relevance paranthetically might have contributed to shape her fury			
 and even to unchange her true self 			
Feminist views her death as a form of martyrdom 			
Her life a case history in the devilish cultural politics 			
that favours men over women and destroys women's creativity 			
Actual biographical details of Plath's may not augment			
this stance 			
However because I think she had sufficient acclaim 			
her poetry was fairly well ratified but in the particular time at			
which she was writing say I think poetry was at a lower base 			
I think even now it is applied 			
When we list this one word I'm sure the			
response will be much better when we discuss poetry probably the response			
is limited because it shows on the one hand the readers' 			
response response and I think poetry is not in great demand 			
So that may not be something very peculiar to Plath 			
However the distinguishing feature of Plath's self in			
her poems particularly her later ones is that she looks at the world			
from the point of view of an oppressed one not strictly gender bound 			
In the last poems there is a rare fury a total release from			
fear 			
The recourse to a aggression in the last poem is neither			
abreast nor aesthetically uncalled for 			
I think if you make a total study of her poems beginning with her			
earlier poems and if you come up to her very late poems this trend could			
be seen 			
This was some sort of a progressive release from the clutches			
 of fear and which culminates in a sort of fury which I think			
render possible the liberation of the self 			
Of course we can cite poems belonging to both groups 			
 I ci I quote a few lines from			
 a poem which is usually quoted to cite her feminist strength in			
 Pardah for example she makes a			
declaration of independence I shall unloose from the small			
jewelled form from the small jewelled doll she got like a heart 			
the lioness the shriek in the barks the cloak of whole 			
In another poem which is a longer poem Three Women			
 			
Through the voices of a wife a secretary and a girl she brings			
to life the feminine sensibilities in relation to being an approved			
mother with a son a woman with a miscarriage and a girl 			
with an accidental daughter whom she gives away 			
Here one would perceive the subtle variation that Plath effect			
 to bring to the fore herself 			
Perhaps even in this period of emotional fury and psychological			
collapse she plucks at courage and pronounces rather forcefully 			
I quote from Winter Tree I am			
no shadow though there is a shadow starting from my feet I am a			
wife 			
The city waits and aches 			
The little grasses cracked through stone and they are green			
 with light 			
This robust assertion on the elemental beauty of life 			
green with life brings in the difference in Plath's self 			
even while being one with a one word a feminist or 			
a confessionist 			
While looking at Plath's poem from a feminist point of			
view one has to bear in mind two vital points 			
One Sylvia Plath may not be a feminist as one is likely			
to believe 			
For she does not commit herself to ideological problems in her			
writings 			
If that is a major concern 			
There is limited gender based class hatred in her poems to			
my mind 			
Time and again she directs her anger against select individuals			
 her father her husband or their symbolic representatives 			
Even the passages of a hot nature when I quote that we find in			
a poem like Lady Lazarus further The			
Applicant and Three Women may not be			
sufficient evidence to argue that Plath had a committed well			
defined feminist politics 			
At best one could say that in such lines I quote from			
 Daddy Her boss her Lucifer devour			
devour out of the ash I write with my red hair and I eat men like			
air 			
 I'm sorry I've quoted these lines from 			
 Lady Lazarus one word They are			
 dancing and scanting jumping on you 			
They always knew it was you 			
Daddy daddy you bastard I am through 			
Plath directed her rage against in the fantacy image of her			
dead father and against her husband into an attack on marriage and			
men or in a more inclusive way which I think maybe more 			
beneficial against violence against total violence perhaps 			
 With your permission to the audiance 			
The strength of her mature poetry suddenly lies in her ability			
to coilate polarities particularly the male female polarities 			
Yielding a delicate or even diabolic of course it is			
questionable balance in the human strain 			
This aspect is borne out by her poems Lasposs			
 Medusa and the other 			
Really she lashes out with equal violence on women 			
I quote Violent attacks on women in this well sort of			
 not far and few 			
This only points to herself with a difference 			
In Lassposs she mocks any bounds			
that exists between one woman and another as a result of their common gender			
 or shared oppression 			
I have quoted the poet herself 			
I quote from one of her poem Your voice my earing			
 flapping and sucking blood loving bath that's that 			
that's that you peer from the doors sad had every woman is a			
whore I can't communicate 			
So I think her problem of defining the self or her problem of			
establishing a camaraderie is not strictly regimented to or confined			
to the men 			
But on the other hand she has been more or less undergoing this			
dramatic experience in relation to women also which I think critics have			
not very often taken into serious consideration 			
 That's my feeling 			
It may be noted that one of her recurrent images of for 			
women is the Medusa image which I think is not a very			
enduring one 			
Plath unlike the later feminist never struck to any particular			
ideology in relation to male female conflicts or what we have now			
begun to term as even the male female crisis 			
Depending on the poetic situations she shifted her views on the			
male female issues 			
For her the prime concern is the integrity of herself 			
Perhaps the difference in her perception and hence her self			
lies in her existencial streak 			
I think I'll be in agreement with previous paper reader			
She strikes again the male and female with equal venom and			
vehemence whenever they irrespective of the gender become a			
threat to her self 			
Plath discusses a consciousness of political issues but the			
focus of her politics was neither women nor men's role in 			
women's oppression 			
As she explained in a B B C interview 			
I quote She was imaginatively involved in those			
historical political events that are closest to the concerned voice in			
her poems 			
She herself has listed a number of concerns Hiroshima atom			
bomb one word and Nazism which again points to her			
protest against the general violence total violence rather than the			
violence impeached on women by men strictly 			
The sequence of her late poems The bee keeper's			
 daughter is quite revealing in this sense 			
In a way it anticipates the Lady Lazarus mood 			
The crux of the sequence in a quest is a quest for an			
independent queenly self 			
The first poem the The Bee Meeting just			
describes the usual practice of replacing old hives 			
But it soon becomes an awful ritual for the protagonist 			
for it is directed by I quote dreary depersonlised 			
a one word like figures of a midwife a rector and a sexton			
 as they are also agents respectively of birth marriage and death			
 			
The poem turns out to be the first step in a cyclic exploration			
of the self 			
Curiously these agents are protected 			
But the protagonist is utterly exposed 			
I quote nude as a chicken neck 			
unquote 			
However the mood of aggression asserting the peculiar strength			
of her self is sustained in the arrival of the Bee-box and stings			
The end of the Rabbit catcher another good poem to be looked at			
from this point of view clearly suggest the constraints set by 			
the man in personal relationships maybe a male female relationship			
 maybe a male say a female female relationship 			
Obviously here too she is concerned with the integrity of the			
self 			
She abhors I quote And we two had a relationship			
 tight wire between us 			
Takes too deep to approve and a mind like earring sliding			
shut on some quick sand 			
The constrict the constriction killing me also 			
two words 			
Even in this way the difference in her self is reflected in			
her persistance on themes relating to children and rebirths in the			
poems of her last phase 			
Sylvia Plath's confessional mood and mood is a			
designed to bring forth the peculiarities of herself 			
 Morning Song Nick and the Candletick Death and			
Company Cuts the Bee-Meeting Tulips etcetera are some			
poems which enable us to go far beyond mere autobiographical			
revealations 			
These poems record I quote Personal experience in			
the patterns that obtain an objective character of though repetition			
 illusion and symbolic inactment 			
Unquote Plath right from the beginning to the end in her			
creative essay has been experimenting with the integrity of the self 			
I underline the integrity of the self through a series of			
emotionally charged even hyper charged explorations by her feminist			
concerns confessional overtures suicidal leaps and through her			
bold linguistic innovations she could present a self with a			
difference to the reading public 			
Thank you 			
Hello I'm Meenakshi V today I'm going to			
speak on the topic Science and Happiness 			
There have been many wonderful discoveries by scientists to make			
our lives more comfortable more safe and more interesting 			
But if we ask the question Have these discoveries made			
men happier ?			
It is difficult to give a true answer 			
The chief difficulty in giving a true answer is because 			
 happiness is not a material thing which can be given			
to us like food or motor or a radio set it is in our mind			
Just think carefully and you will see that this is so 			
If you get something which pleases you the happiness is not in			
the thing but in your mind which finds the thing pleasurable 			
There is another point about happiness 			
which is also worth thinking about 			
Happiness does not depend upon the amount of things you have 			
It does not come to you when you try to get it and keep it 			
On the contrary it depends on the fewer fewness of your wants			
Just think about it this also carefully 			
A man who has many wants always wants more 			
He wants one thing and tries to get it 			
He gets it but he is not satisfied 			
He wants something else 			
The more he gets the more he wants 			
Is not that true of most people who want wealth or power or			
high position ?			
Most people are like that even if their wants are for 			
smaller things 			
A boy wants a bicycle 			
His father gives him one 			
He sees someone with a be better 			
 bicycle so he wants one like that 			
When he is a little older he wants a motor cycle 			
Then he wants a motor car 			
If he has enough money to buy one he wants another and a bigger			
one and so on 			
But a man who has few wants whether he is poor or rich has			
a much better chance of being happy 			
The wisest men in the world have taught us that the only			
complete happiness is when one wants nothing 			
It is difficult for us to be like that 			
But nevertheless it is true that merely having more does			
not make us happier 			
That is why most people are not happier today even with many			
wonderful and useful new things that science has discovered and given us 			
Some of the things which science has given us have certainly helped			
 to make our lives happier 			
Science has helped us to get rid of many sickness of the body 			
That is a great thing 			
It is difficult to be happy in your body if your body is			
full of pain 			
We have learnt of the many discoveries made by scientists to			
make us painless and to get rid of the cause of pain and sickness 			
By making it possible to cure terrible diseases such as malaria			
 small-pox plague pneumonia and tuberculosis science has			
lenghtened the life of the average man 			
In nineteen hundred every baby born in the U S A could be			
expected to live less than fifty years 			
Fifty years later the health conditions have so much improved			
that the average length of life was nearly seventy years 			
A few hundred years ago the average length of life was less			
than thirty years 			
 But it certain but it is certain sorry 			
 but is it certain that people were less happy in those times			
 ?			
What is the use what what is the use of living longer			
unless you are also happy ?			
Science is helping man to produce much more food from the earth			
By this it is helping to prevent famine and sickness due to			
undernourishment 			
It has also made it possible to send quick relief to places			
where there is shortage of food and medicines with the help of motor uh			
motor lorries railway trains ships and aeroplanes 			
This is also very good and many lives are saved in such ways 			
But in India and some other countries such as Indonesia and			
South America the number of people is increasing faster than than the			
food supply 			
Science has not yet found out how to solve that problem 			
It is a very serious because there will be worse and worse			
famine unless it is solved 			
And people certainly cannot be happy if they are starving 			
can they ?			
There are also many discoveries of science which have definitely			
brought unhappiness into the world 			
That is not because the discoveries are bad but because men			
are using them badly 			
For example consider the discovery of the gun powder and of			
other explosives each more powerful than the previous one discovered 			
In ancient times men could wound and kill each other only if they			
were near enough to strike each other with stones arrows spears or			
swords 			
Even in the battles of the olden times which history calls			
great battles the armies on both the sides usually consisted only of			
a few thousand men and the number of wounded and killed in the wars 			
of those times was not very great 			
In most wars except a few such as the wars which destroyed the			
Roman Empire the peasant went on cultivating their fields peacefully 			
even when the armies were fighting a few miles away 			
But the invention of fire arms and high explosives caused a			
great change 			
A modern machine gun or quick firing gun worked by a			
single man can wound and kill hundreds of people in a few minutes			
One modern bomb can kill thousands 			
It is said that the latest type of atomic bomb could kill 			
hundreds of thousands of people immediately if it was dropped on a big			
city 			
The scientists who invented these terrible weapons are			
not wicked men who enjoy killing 			
They are people with kind hearts like yours and mine but			
they are more clever and they can earn their living by discovering new			
things 			
It is the leaders of the various nations who employ them to			
make discoveries which can be used to kill the people of 			
o other nations that are to blame 			
The same country discoveries could be used only for useful			
purposes if the leaders did not allow them to be used for killing 			
Explosives are not harmful if they are used for such purposes			
as helping to get coal metals and other minerals out of the earth 			
The same motors and aeroplanes which are used to carry guns and			
drop bombs can be very useful for good purposes 			
So you see that it is not the discoveries and inventions that are			
bad but the ways in which men use them 			
Now let us try to find out why men use them for harmful			
purposes 			
It is not easy to find this out but it is very important 			
Unless you can find it out there will be more and more terrible			
wars in your your own time and if we go on like that our			
grand-children will not be able to live in this world at all 			
The earth will become a desert and mankind will come to an end 			
With these few words I end my speech 			
Thank you for giving me an oppotunity to speak 			
Thank you once again 			
Hello I'm Shantala speaking in uh speaking			
 for the total literacy in if inevitable			
 for the political social and economic development of a country			
On the world scene on one hand India can stand proudly shoulder to			
shoulder with frontline countries in matters of space research 			
advanced technology etcetera 			
But in literacy queue we are far behind other countries 			
 It's well known world over that the areas of poverty and			
illiteracy more or less overlap each other in a map and continued			
illiteracy can be a major handicap for the growth and development of			
democratic institution in a country 			
In this context functional literacy becomes all the more			
significant and important 			
Mere advertisement and learning three hours is of no			
consequence 			
Rather than an end in itself literacy should be regarded as a			
way of preparing man for social and civil and economic role 			
Literacy teaching is resolutely oriented towards development 			
and should be an integral part of not only of any national educational plans			
 but also of plans and projects for development of all sectors of			
national life 			
Considering the experience of many other countries the targets			
fixed by India's educational planners are by no means beyond			
realisation but still are lagging behind 			
 Let's analyse the need for our relevance of literacy in a			
few more specific situations 			
There are very prejudices facts and taboos which frown			
upon literacy go indeed to demonstrate its strength			
Let us start with the example of industrial workers 			
An Industrial worker in a an organised			
sector however intelligent and enterprising is also in need of access			
to information about the source of raw material and its conversation to			
 finished goods price standardisation and quality control marketing 			
rate fixation process provision relating to safety and the work at			
the work place etcetera 			
A belief that thus an illiterate worker can also successfully			
operate machines can repar repair and			
maintain them is nothing but a an affirmation 			
of a blind prejudice could be the outcome of vested interests 			
A worker in the unorganised or the semi- organised sector			
is in need of sem similar access to			
information about various process of modernisation improved farming			
 suitability of a particular soil to a particular crop quality of			
seeds fertilisers and other modern methods 			
The malfunctional middlemen who rob the legitimate share of the			
farm and the forest produce may be tactfully dropped 			
The plight of the share croppers of the landless agricultural			
labourers fact factors which lead to			
their indebtness and bondage will be improved to a very great extent 			
Yet another important segment of the society is the rural artisans			
They should also wake up from their traditional slumber and look			
around them and the world 			
They must look beyond the crude and antiquited ways of making goods			
Example of back blacksmith 			
should leave his old slumber and switch on to new electric arc			
furnace etcetera			
The potter to electric wheels and others 			
In the social background improving the sta 			
 status of women uh depends mostly on literating the			
woman 			
It helps in warding off the superstition and other social evils too			
Woman it helps a woman in tracing her identity and strength			
and weakness herself 			
No more she is what we say in Sanskrit Koop Manduke			
 that's the frog in the well 			
And even in the political situation the voting right of a person			
is denied that is because a person is illiterate 			
And if a person is literate he ca he			
cannot be deceived by the politi 			
political parties or the politicians 			
They can fight for the rights to a greater extent 			
Thus literacy in a sense is not a dose which can produce instant			
and dramatic results 			
It can it's an absract weapon through though			
powerful which gradually trains and equips some human mind and prepares			
it increasingly for eventual change 			
These few words of mine add up to the inevitability of total			
literacy for a countries all round development 			
Thank you 			
My dear ladies and gentleman 			
I would like to speak on the relevance of English education 			
andbeyond 			
In fact uh I am not going to deal with the			
beyond 			
I am going to speakonly on The relevance of 			
English education 			
Uh let me start with the background			
There was a time when The sun did not set from			
the British Empire 			
That is the Empire spread almost all over the world 			
Along with the Empire the English language also spread all over the			
world 			
Now the sun almost does not arise on the British Empire 			
But the English language has now become an			
international language known all over the world 			
What is more it is the intelligentia of the world language			
Now less than half of the globe speaks English as its			
native speaker native language 			
They are the inhabitants of Great Britain U.S.A. Canada			
 Australia New Zealand the Caribbean and South Africa 			
And this accounts for three hundred million speakers 			
In the rest of the world Englishis used in various other			
parts either as foreign language or a second language including			
in the U.S.S. R.			
However restricted in its way 			
Roughly there are three major speech communities 			
spoken all over the world 			
First The native speakers second 			
 Second language speakers and third 			
Foreign languagespeakers 			
The predominant position of English in the world had something			
to do with two factors 			
One is the colonisation of British Empire among otherminor			
European powers towards the end of nineteenth century and stabilized			
in the year twentieth century until the outbreak of 			
south wo Second World War			
And secondly The independence from the British colonies from			
the end of Second World War which has been on 			
The latest as you know is Hong Kong which will be free in			
nineteen ninety-seven 			
After independence the new countries were confronted			
with theproblem of national language and or official language 			
A few African and Asian countries opted for English			
The transition was not very easy as many factors were			
involved particularly the size of the country and the size of the			
speech communities whether they are mon mono-lingual or			
multi-lingual communities 			
The case of India is a very special one 			
One thing that happened to India after independence was that 			
the number of Princely States thanks to Sardar Patel were 			
integrated into the erstwhile British Provinces 			
Secondly we have already by this time a de			
facto lingua franca in fact two			
 lingua francas if you like English and Hindi			
Now the position of English in India is that at the			
time of independence English was the de facto			
official language but soon after that we decided to accept Hindi as			
our national language as en enshrined in the Indian			
Constitution 			
Along with Hindi we decided to continue with English as an			
Associate Official Language for fifteen years from the 			
commencement of the Indian Constitution in nineteen fifty up to			
nineteen sixty-five 			
In the meantime wedecided to cultivate and develop Hindi to			
take over from English in the hope that it would be relegated to			
the position of foreign language that is for restrictive			
functions 			
And Hindi would take over fully not only as a national language			
 but also as the official language and as the lingua			
franca of the pan-Indian language 			
However during the period of fifteenyears something seems			
to have gone wrong 			
Perhaps because of one of the uh factors that is the			
 creation of Linguistic States the position of Hindi seems to have			
suffered a setback and we had to continue English as an associate			
official language indefinitely 			
So at the moment our national language is Hindi our+			
official language is English and our lingua franca			
 link language seems to be divided			
 broadly speaking English and Hindi 			
These link languages cut across the two regions north and south			
 on the one hand and the two sections of society all over the country			
English as second language in India 			
It might be useful to remember at the backof our mind the			
concept of Second Language before we go on 			
 Second language by definition fulfills 			
four important functions namely instrumental regulative			
 interpersonal and imaginative 			
In India the main instrumental and regulative functions are			
 fulfilled by education and administration respectively 			
The interpersonal function is fulfilled by one of the link			
languages that is English 			
It is in fact a linklanguage between the regional language 			
speakers especiallythose who do not understand Hindi or even if they			
 knowHindi will prefer it to English 			
Finally the imaginative function is fulfilled by a large body of			
 well established literature namely Indian writing in			
English next only to native English literatures such as			
British American Australian Canadian and other literatures			
 The ups and downs in the position of English 			
We can discern two phase phases in post independent			
era of English inIndia 			
The first up to nineteen sixty-five and the second after that			
Even before independence the medium of instruction at regional			
language at the secondary schools and English as second languages			
 was taught in all such schools 			
There were of course certain English medium schools also			
And the medium of instruction was uh English throughout			
post-school level			
As early as nineteen forty nine The University			
Education Commission recommended a gradual change over of 			
mediu medium of instruction+ from English to Indian languages			
 at the higher stage at the also 			
The three languages regional federal presumably Hindi			
 and English are to be studied at seco at higher			
secondary and university stages 			
In the year nineteen fifty-one fifty-two The			
Secondary Education Commission recommended that the study of			
English should be given importance in secondary schools and			
facilities shouldbe made available at the middle school stage for			
its study on an optional basis 			
Thus English was taught as a main second language at			
the school system in all the stages and in all the States			
It was taughtfor anything between four to seven years 			
partly or wholly as a compulsory subject 			
The report of the Official Language Commission nineteen			
fifty-six made a clear cut distinction between lan			
 English language and English literature 			
Hitherto English literature was taught even with			
 at the school stage but now the regional			
languages had already become the medium of instruction throughout the			
secondary schools and gradually it was being used as a medium of			
 certain faculties even at the university stage 			
Under the circumstances the position of English has undergone a			
great change 			
Inthe words of the report uh I quote 			
English has to be taught hereafter as a language of comprehension			
rather than as a literary language unquote 			
After the creation of the Linguistic States we witnessed one of			
the most controversial issue issues in Indian			
Education that is the place of English in our educational set up 			
From angrezi hatao 			
Downwith English at one extreme to English as the			
sole medium of education at the other 			
were widespread unrest and riots all over the country			
It is in this context that The Three Language formula			
 was proposed 			
It was subsequently modified in the Kothari Commission Report			
 nineteen sixty-four sixty-six 			
 The three language formula sought I quote			
 to establish equally equality 			
with regard to the study of language between Hindi and non-Hindi 			
speaker speaking areas 			
It recommended that as against the third language Hindi			
 along uh another lan another Indian			
language besides Hindi and English should be studied by			
 pupils in Hindi speaking area unquote 			
This almost amounts to punishment 			
There was no motivation whatsoever for the Hindi speaking pupil			
 to learn another modern Indian language modern 			
English Indian language 			
Thus The three language formula seems to			
have failed 			
In the meantime the role of English has undergone change			
As we have mentioned earlier instead of English literature 			
we have sought to cultivate English language 			
Pioneering work has been undertaken by the Central Institute of			
English C.I.E. Hyderabad created in nineteen fifty-eight 			
English began to be considered as second language and the			
appropriate methods of teaching English were proposed			
In course of time several other institutions like the Regional			
Institute of English R.I.E. State Institute of English S.I.E and			
so on spread 			
And on the whole the overall educational facilities had tremendously			
increased			
Not only in school level but also at the college and university			
levels 			
The latest All India Education Commission Kothari			
Commission Report has advocated the study of English 			
on an optional basis at the primary level that is from fifth			
to seventh and on secondary basis at the secondary level that is			
 eight to ten and again optional basis higher secondary			
level that is uhm eleven to twelve in its scheme of seven			
 uh twelve year school and three year degree course for the			
entire country that is ten plus two plus three 			
And the position of English has been prescribed sorry 			
described as a library language 			
Today English is English in India is an			
important if not compulsory secondary language at all stages of			
education 			
Now let me uhm look at The National			
Policy of Education and Plan Action 			
Two decades of intense planning and implementation of mass			
education that is quantitative improve improve 			
improvement the government of India hasnow turned to the qualitative			
improvement of uhimprovement of educational facilities 			
In the year nineteen eighty-six the national policy of education			
and plan of action popularly known as NPE 			
and POA modified in nineteen ninety-two were			
launched 			
It then reviewed the National Policy from nineteen sixty-eight to			
nineteen eighty-six and noted that there have been slow progress			
in the implementation of these recommendations and emphasised the need			
for a dynamic approach 			
As far as the development of language is concerned the medium of			
instruction at the university stage has been unsatisfactory on			
account of two factors ( a) the preparation and production of these text			
books has not synchronised with the universities decision to switch			
over to modern English modern Indian 			
languages 			
And ( b) secondly second uhm uhm university teacher 			
having received education through English find it difficult to teach			
through their English language in Indian languages 			
More importantly the universities are reluctant to change their			
medium ofinstruction in regard to Indian languages because the lack			
of employment opportunities to those who have studied in those languages 			
There is no special mention of medium of instruction in the chapter			
on higher education in this document 			
However the development of English language trained 			
 uh training institution is encouraged 			
+ centres have been set up for imparting training to			
English language teacher at school stage and have trained			
one point five lakh of English teachers 			
Now among other things the NPE suggests the			
delinking of degree requirement for employment wherever feasible			
One of themost important measures taken in respect of 			
qualitative improvement of the Engl education was the creation of			
 institutes institutions of excellence uh 			
Navodaya Vidyalaya 			
Since nineteen eighty-six Navodaya 			
Vidya Vidyanagar Vid Vidyalayas were set up in two			
hundred and eighty districts spread over twenty-nine States and			
Union Territories of Territories for children who are			
potentially high achiever 			
 Acharya Rammurthi CommissionReport notes 			
that in the name of qualitative improvement of education the			
National Policy of Educationand Programme of Action have been			
criticised for the reclu uh exclusion of the poor 			
from the educational process and he decries elitism 			
The relevance of English education 			
We have now to ask a question how relevant English			
education is in our country ? 			
 I've been asked to make a statement not only about the			
relevance of English education butalso beyond it 			
But first let me make certain statements of the			
first part How relevant English education is ?			
You will find from the fifth uh fifth All India			
Education Survey of the NCERT nineteen ninety-two compiled			
in nineteen eighty-six that is ten years ago there were two major			
language medium uh medium schools all over the country 			
One Hindi medium Hindi medium schools			
 and two English medium schools 			
Apart from these there were several Indian language medium			
schools particularly mother tongue languages language			
schools which were minor ones 			
All put together there were six point four lakh			
 of schools in the country at all levels primary upper			
primary and secondary 			
Out of these the majority of English medium schools account for			
two point four four lakhs of schools followed by			
 uhm zero point nine nine lakh that is less than one			
 lakh of Hindi medium schools 			
That is to say that all the media of instructions in the whole			
of India there were six point four lakh of schools 			
outof which English medium schools account for four two point			
four four lakhs 			
That is more than one third of all the schools in the entire			
country 			
What is more interesting is that the English medium			
schoolswere much more both in the urban and the ural uh the			
rural sections 			
In the rural areas there were seventy-five thousand Hindi			
medium schools as against two lakh of English medium			
schools that is two and a half time 			
Similarly in the urban sector there were only twenty-four			
thousand Hindi medium schools as against uh forty-nine thousand English			
medium schools that is as much as double the number 			
In that there were more number of English medium schools in			
rural areas than in urban ones 			
These statistics perve pertaining 			
 to the prevailing year nineteen eighty-six 			
Today in the year nineteen ninety-six what that is 			
ten year after that what is the real situation ? 			
We do not know the statistics now but we can project			
it on an impressional uh impressionistic basis for example			
 a small town my own place Kolhapur 			
Let me start with some quotations 			
One As far as laws of mathematics refer to reality			
 they are not certain 			
As far as they are certain they do not refer to reality			
 			
This is by Albert Einstein 			
 Introduction of exactness in mathematics and			
logic is artificial and forced 			
All traditional logic assumes that precise symbols are			
employed 			
It is therefore not applicable to this terrestrial life 			
but only can imaginal imaginary celestial			
existence 			
That is Burtrend Russell 			
 As the complexity of the system increases our ability			
to make precise and yet significant statements about its			
behaviour diminishes 			
Until a threshold is reached beyond which precision and			
significance become mutually exclusive characters 			
This is Lotsizadeh the founder or discoverer of Fuzzy			
sets 			
The first is a physicist scientist 			
The second is a philosopher mathematician logician 			
And the third is a technocrat 			
So 			
What was his name ?			
Lotsizadeh L O T S I Z A D E H B B writing			
 			
The scientist philosophers and technologist are unanimous			
 on one point Mathematics falls far short of their			
expectations in coping with reality 			
Let us probe a little deeper 			
Consider the following three questions 			
Question one What will be the distance of the planet			
Neptune from Earth on March twenty-eight two thousand and one			
 ?			
Question two Who will win maximum world medals in the			
forth coming Olympics ?			
Question three Will the world be better to live			
in by the turn of the century ?			
The first question the question about distance			
 is precise and is and it is possible to			
give a reasonably precise answer 			
In some cases a precise answer may not be possible at the			
present level of technological development but there is a general			
consensus about the theoritical existence of such answers 			
The questions of this type can be handled with admirably			
adequate efficiency by present day mathematics 			
The second question about the medals falls in the			
different category 			
Though the question is precise the precise answer is not			
possible till the event actually takes place 			
These are speculating questions 			
And there probablistic answers can be given with the help of			
 statistical theory 			
However it is the third type of question which is of primary			
importance to me in my today's talk 			
 Will the world be a better place to live in by the turn			
of the century ?			
Such type of questions cover very vast areas of our cognition			
Most of the real life problems belongs to this category 			
The formulation of these types of question is in a			
very vague language 			
The meaning of the question may change not only from			
person to person but from time to time for the same person and			
yet the question is quite meaningful 			
All of us will agree that this world needs much to be			
desired 			
But the prescription of the better 			
betterment of the world changes from person to person 			
 Will everybody be happy if he or she is rich 			
 ?			
Let us not labour on happiness 			
Philosophers have written volumes on the state of happiness 			
and the ways to achieve it 			
But nobody seems to have been benefitted from the reading			
 of those books except their publishers and possibly their			
authors 			
But what about the richness ?			
The word richness has many shades 			
But I'm using it in a very mundane earthly sense 			
How much wealth one should amass so that one is called rich			
Rockfeller is rich so is Ford an average Indian is not			
rich 			
So I think there is some standard on which all of			
us agree 			
But such agreement does not last long 			
A person whom I consider very rich may be an average			
middle class commoner in the sense of Rockfeller 			
Thus the concept of richness seems to be highly subjective			
 relative or self referential 			
Besides who should be call rich ?			
One whose annual income is say five million 			
And if the answer is affirmative what about the one 			
whose income is little less than that ?			
Say forty-five hundred thousand 			
And this argument will continue till a stage is reached 			
where one cannot decide whether a person getting the specific amount			
would be placed in the category of rich persons or not 			
For one may seek any threshold for deciding the richness			
 but a person earning little less than the limit need not be			
considered non-rich 			
Thus the so called threshold is not only highly arbitrary			
 but extremely foggy and indiscernible 			
And still the question is meaningful 			
Most of the questions of real world are of this nature 			
They are fuzzy 			
So what causes fuzziness ?			
There are several factors which contribute to fuzziness 			
Let me mention some of them 			
Natural language the first and foremost among the causes			
of fuzziness is the intrinsic weakness of natural languages 			
Again it is very much debatable whether it is a			
 the strength or the weakness 			
But there are no two opinions that there is some one			
word vagueness in all natural languages 			
Consider for example the following adjectives uh			
 tall fellow an intelligent lady			
 a handsome youth or for that matter			
 the following sentences 			
 If you work a little harder you will get much			
more 			
Heavier vehicle should be driven more cautiously 			
The more they change the more they are the same			
 			
Though all these are very much meaningful sentences their			
meaning is never precise 			
The second factor contributing to fuzziness is 			
subjective preferences 			
Added to intrinsic fuzziness of a language there is some			
subjective element related to the user 			
The same word may have different meanings at different			
places to different persons at different times and in different			
circumstances 			
A young man of twenty-five year will consider a fifty year old			
 man a old man but if you ask the opinion of the fifty			
year old on the same question he will say that he's			
 quite young and energetic 			
Uh there is a very beautiful story about uh this in			
 Vedas 			
Well it is not written here uh completely 			
Prajapati the sup the supreme			
 Creator was once approached by humans god and			
monster 			
Prajapati created them all but they were unhappy in his			
world 			
So they asked him to advise them 			
Prajapati said C C C I mean capital			
 C 			
The human thought that they were greedy 			
They wanted everything for themselves that must be the cause			
of their grief 			
So Prajapati must have told them to show charity 			
Charity starts with C 			
 G god thought that they			
were pleasure seekers they all the time sitting in the heavens 			
drinking nector and engaged in sensual pleasure 			
So god uh the Prajapati asked them to control			
themselves and not to allow their passions to take better			
of them 			
Monsters thought that they were cruel and unkind 			
They did not care for miseries of others 			
That must be the cause of their own misery 			
So Prajapati asked them to show compassion 			
Thus C became charity for men control for god 			
compassion for monsters 			
Well let us assume that in this type of questions some			
psychological factors are in involved 			
So let us consider the problem of controlling warmness of			
water in shower bath 			
Here the concept of warmness depends on the particular person 			
particular time particular place particular season and above all the			
particular mental or physical condition of the user 			
Note that this problem unlike the earlier one is not			
of academic interest but of economic interest of manufacturers of shower			
bath equipments 			
And hence for control engineers 			
The third factor that contributes to fuzziness is inadequacy of			
information 			
Many a time there is no sufficient knowledge of the			
system 			
For example scientist is always aware that he knows			
no final truth 			
He may be sceptic even about well established theory 			
On the frontiers of knowledge he is always on slippery ground			
If in addition the data is ana 			
inadequate everything becomes a matter of guess work			
Then all he has to rely upon is a working hypothesis 			
based on state of the aa knowledge and unprovable basic			
assumptions 			
These assumptions can be a matter of verbal 			
perceptions as in medical and social problems 			
Sometimes one has to infer not only from insufficient data			
 but also from information which is not wholly reliable 			
For example if you are working with strategies in the			
battlefield 			
Next factor that contributes to fuzziness is			
interdependence of concepts 			
A cyclical behaviour of natural phenomena is a very 			
favourite concept of Indian a ancient			
Indian philosophers 			
And cycle has no cut points 			
The seeds of decay for an Indian philosopher are present 			
in the growth itself 			
The transformation of growth into decay is so subtle that			
you cannot put a demarcation line between them 			
Or let us be more plain 			
If the demand of certain commodity increases its price 			
rises 			
But the rise in price results in decrease in the demand 			
The end affects the means and the means affect the end 			
To win elections a political party has to take some			
populist measures 			
But such measures result into deficient deficit			
financing and causes inflation 			
And prices rise 			
If the prices rise it is difficult to win in the elections			
This interdependents of concepts causes fuzziness in decision			
In complex systems like human body or national ec			
 economy the effects of this fuzziness can be 			
very easily observed 			
Complexity of the system is one more cause of fuzziness 			
In many real life problems specially where human element is			
involved the system is so complex that it is impossible to control or			
even to take into account all the affecting factors 			
Then it becomes a matter of personal choice to decide which			
factors are to be considered and which are to be ignored 			
And such a choice in general is not easy 			
Then cost effectiveness 			
Many a time it is theoritically possible to quantify 			
all the parametres of the system 			
But the cost involved in doing so is so huge that 			
it is more profitable to ignore certain factors and the choice of			
relevant factors depends many times on personal preferences 			
This causes fuzziness 			
Fuzziness of concept is an open invitation to paradoxes			
Here are some of them 			
Suppose we have a small heap of stones 			
small italics 			
 Smallness is a fuzzy concept 			
If we uh remove stones from heap then of course it will be			
a smaller heap 			
But even if we add a stone to a small heap it will remain			
small 			
Now let us start with the heap of a single stone 			
which is definitely small 			
Since addition of the stone does not affect the smallness of			
the heap one can go on adding a stone 			
One stone at a time 			
And still continue to get a small heap this leads to the			
paradoxical situation where every heap is small 			
Another uhm paradox which I am going to state here is			
 Bonkare paradox 			
We all know that real numbers are totally ordered 			
In this order they are so densely close to each other that			
 it is impossible to separate consecutive real numbers 			
One can easily observe that if A 			
and B are two real numbers however close to each			
other there is a number A plus B			
 by two that lies between them 			
In fact they're there are uncountably many of them			
lying between A and B 			
Real numbers can be represented as points on an infinite			
continual uh a straight line 			
Any two adjacent points on the con on			
the continuum are so indistinguishable from each other 			
that they almost overlap 			
The last universalist Henry Bonkare described this			
situation by the following formula 			
 A is equal to B 			
 B is equal to C 			
But A is not equal to C 			
Uh an analogy of this mathematical contridiction may be			
 described in the following way 			
Suppose we have a whole spectrum of different shades of			
colours say red anything arranged in order 			
of lightness of or the percentage of the redness 			
The change in two consecutive shades is so minute and			
gradual that even a trained eye can not distinguish them 			
If S one S two S three are three			
neighbouring shades then S one cannot be separated			
from S two nor can S two from S three			
 			
However S one can be separated from			
 S three 			
And in this sense S one is equal to 			
S two S two is equal to S three			
 but S one is not equal to S three			
 			
Finally I talked of Bonkare paradox 			
This is an ancient paradox 			
Also know as a paradox of a lier 			
 Etimonised Etimonised who himself a			
 Cretin says that all cretin are liers 			
Now if Etimonised statement is true then being a			
lier himself his statement is fuzz 			
On the other hand if his statement is fuzz then he not being a			
lier may say true statement 			
Thus the statement is true if and only if it is fuzz 			
These paradoxes are the results of our attempt to put in			
precisely expressed concepts into the rigour of Aristotlian logic 			
The classic case of fitting a square pet in the round hole			
Naturally there is an unbridgeable gap between the two			
The deductive method that we employ to derive theorems in			
mathematics and logic is based on the following three basic Aristotlian			
laws 			
 Law of Identity 			
 A proposition is what it is or in symbols 			
 S is X 			
The second law Law of Excluded Middle 			
 A proposition is either true or false X			
 is either Y or not Y			
 			
 The Law of Contridiction 			
No proposition can be both true and false X			
 can not be Y and not Y			
 			
Just as in a soap opera a character is all good or all bad we			
have in our above logic either whole truth or the whole untruth			
There is no room for partial truth 			
For this reason Aristotlian logic is called two valued logic			
 			
Uh now before I go on to the way 			
Indian writing in English got a new lease of life in the 			
in the in the seventees uh it it got a new lease of life by			
being a part of whatever you call Commonwealth Literature			
 			
I mean I want to talk about that a little later 			
But before that I want to say one or two things about 			
present critical responses to Indian writing in English 			
 certain trends and possibilities you see 			
I read a paper on this some time ago and I thought uh 			
some of the things that I mentioned in the paper are relevant to our 			
discussion in Indian writing in English 			
Uhm in this paper first I take three poles 			
I mean I say that we can uh uh arrange a critical			
responses according to the three poles that are in Indian writing in			
English 			
One is related to the term Indian the			
other is related to the term English and the third			
is related to the term writing 			
So I say let's first concentrate our attention on			
the pole of English and survey the area of responses centred upon			
it 			
The early British responses are to be understood I think in the			
context of the colonial situation that existed at that time 			
characterised by the master-slave relationship tempered by the			
teacher-student relationship of of uh liberal encouragement and			
patronage 			
You all know about the concept of The white 			
man's burden 			
The question is whether the British attitude was really 			
what David McCutchion thought it was that of patronising approval 			
And with David McCutchion who talks about Indian writing in English			
and what the British thought of Indian writing in English 			
 He he his uh he saw he thought that uh 			
there is always a patronising approval there is a patronising attitude			
 uh We are astonished he says not that it is			
done well but that it is done at all 			
Uh I'm sure David McCutchion judges his			
Victorian eh uh compatriots like Edmund Gosse then M A H A L Fisher			
 Arthur Symons Laurence Binyon and young W B Yeats rather			
ungenerously attributing to them an attitude of superfluous 			
superiority 			
These are these were the people who talked about Indian writing			
in English 			
Uh uh you know Edmund Gosse wrote about uh uh Toru			
Dutt poetry 			
And he has referenced it to all these people who uh uh liked			
Indian writing in English for one reason or another 			
I do not think that Gosse was patting on Toru Dutt's 			
back out of uh adulterated kindness born of parental			
superiority 			
If you look at what uh Gosse wrote about Toru Dutt he don't			
uh find this uh this kind of patting it is genuine criticism 			
Now this is what Gosse wrote to Toru Dutt Literature			
has no honours which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl 			
who at the age of twenty-one and in language separated from her own 			
by so deep a chasm had produced so much of lasting worth 			
When the history of literature of our own country comes to be			
written there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile 			
exotic blossom of songs 			
Of course I mean uh he likes her for what she has written 			
and also with the word that term exotic is important 			
That she has a place in the history of English literature 			
And uh he also likes her because of uh the the the			
exoticism that she brings in through her poetry 			
This surely is not a patronising approval 			
It is uh serious criticism expressed with certain generosity			
 without falsifying the truth of his judgement 			
Now the second example that I give for such genuine kind			
of uh response uh without any offence of pat 			
 patronage uh or one word is that of 			
Yeats's appreciation of Tagore's Gitanjali 			
If you read uh I refer to this yesterday if you read uh			
 Yeats's uh uh preface to Tagore's Gitanjali			
 we find that uh this appreciation uh of Tagore his			
appreciation of Tagore throbs with a singular sincerity of			
response 			
I quote The work of a supreme culture they			
yet appear as mu as much the growth of			
the common soil as the grass and the rushes 			
A whole people a whole civilization immeasurably strange			
to us 			
Once again the the note of exoticism immeasurably strange to us 			
 seems to have been taken up into this imagination and			
yet we were moved because of the strangeness but because we have			
 met our own image as though we had walked in Rossetti's 			
 Willow wood or heard perhaps for the first time			
in literature our voice as in a dream unquote 			
What we had to accept is the sincerity and genuineness of			
critical response in tune with the literary tradition to which the			
critics belonged 			
I don't see any exaggerated and patronising praise in for			
example Graham Green's comparison of uh uh R K Narayan			
 with Chekov or Herbert Read's faith in Shankar Mokashi			
 Punekar's poetry or Milton Brown's comparison of			
the chronicles of Kedaram with Main Street and Cranford 			
The tradition of enthusiastic appreciation of Indian works in			
English by western critics they include the Australian critics as well			
 is a continous phenomenon which has to be accounted for I think 			
phase-wise taking into consideration the changing context of Indian			
writing in English 			
The early phase was coloured by a certain self confessed 			
generosity I mean we should agree 			
Even though it is genuine there is a certain amount of self			
conscious generosity 			
And uh there was no question of misreading our Indian			
Indo-English literature since it was well within the traditions of			
English poetry with which they were familiar 			
The so called exotic element in it might have cast a little spell			
 but it was never blinding or binding so as to distort their			
critical sense 			
After Independence Indian writing in English			
 achieved its identity as a viable body of literature 			
The responses of people like Graham Greene William Walsh E			
M Foster and Laurence Durrel were seized by us with avidity 			
since they helped us in building up our confidence in the valley of			
our literature soon			
Thanks to the rise of uh Commonwealth literature			
 in answer to the new political and cultural needs of the			
erstwhile colonies of England Indian writing in English			
 claimed a place legitimate and illegitimate at the same time			
Legitimate because of the medium and illegitimate from the			
point of view of the centrality of Indian experience uh obtained the			
place in it and it was subjected to scholarly study of western and			
Australian Commonwealth literature experts like Riemenschneider 			
Keith uh uh Carelein Syd Harrex Haydn Moore Williams Dorothy			
Spencer Kai Nicholson etcetera 			
This post nineteen sixty criticism is characterised by a good			
deal of misreading although it was based on well meaning laborous close			
reading 			
They misreading being the result of a lack of cultural			
inwardness 			
These critics trained in uh in the tradition of New			
Criticism discover in our novelist patterns and layers of meaning			
not easily visible to a norman normal Indian			
reader 			
Now I make this uh uhm po point			
 with a reference to William Walsh what he wrote about R K			
Narayan and also what uh uh some Australian critic wrote about			
 Jejuri 			
So Jejuri I mentioned yesterday today I'm going to say			
something that William Walsh's response to R K Narayan's 			
fiction and uh particularly you should r 			
read in his book Commonwealth Literature 			
his uh response to R K Narayan's Guide 			
His response is sincere and subtle no doubt but the question is			
 do the novels of uh R K Narayan really stand this over subtle and			
over enthusiastic scrutiny ?			
But then what is historically important is the western 			
critic's joy of discovery which always colours their perceptions			
In the case of Narayan's or Anand's fiction the			
western reader finds an easy entry through ironic or realistic modes 			
employed in it 			
But it is when they encounter Raja Rao that they are			
baffled 			
David McCutchion for instance confesses frankly the			
Anglo-Saxon mind does not understand India very well he says			
With Aurobindo too they experience an opacity of response			
Walsh for instance finds Aurobindo evasive 			
constantly escaping the grapple of the western mind and			
dismisses him by saying the importance of Aurobindo Ghosh			
belongs rather to the history of ideas and of religion than literature			
 			
The Western critical sensibility loves irony realism			
concreteness conflict and rigidity of form and it gets baffled and			
frustrated when it faces something abstract apparently formless			
 spiritual and mystical 			
In the dialectics of critical process or to use Leacis's			
 phrase in the collaborative effort of literary criticism this			
honest bafflement has a significant role to play 			
It leads to a healthy discussion of a literary and critical			
assumptions and to certain important clarifications 			
The bafflement of the western readers with regard to Raja Rao's			
 fiction for instance particularly Serpent and the Rope			
 and uh one word and Shakespear uh for instance			
inspired Professor Narasimaih and Dr Na M K			
Naik uh Narasimiah and Dr M K Naik's excellent			
analyses of uh Raja Rao's works 			
What is important is the livingness of the critical process 			
which ultimately cannot be dis dissociated 			
 from the process of culture or life in general 			
Thanks to the fact that Indian writing in English			
 is easily accessible to the western English speaking and			
English knowing world because of the medium the western response has			
grown into a tradition to such an extent that the western and Australian			
critics can carry on their dialogue on Indian writing in			
English without reference to Indian critics at all 			
No other Indian literature enjoys this exposure to the outside			
world which therefore tends to equate Indian writing in English with			
Indian literature 			
This has created an anomalous situation 			
In Commonwealth studies literary conferences and festivals 			
it is this Indian writing in English that gets 			
national representation 			
What is of relevance to the uh question we are discussing in			
this seminar is the fact that the western response is a positive factor			
 in the development of Indo-English literature and criticism 			
With its enthusiasm its over estimation with its quest for			
Indianness for Indian philosophical and esoteric speculations for			
Indian sociological pecularities with its bafflements and limitations 			
with its habits of close reading in search of deeper layers of meaning			
 the western response adds a new dimension to our own critical			
awareness which it keeps alive and kicking all the time 			
 Let's now move uh uh to the pole represented			
in term in the term Indian 			
This uh of great signi significance			
 in the context of the critical climate that we have been			
talking about because it is the it is the uh centripetal			
movement towards the roots 			
As far as Indian writing in English is concerned the first 			
uh big uh movement is to be discovered in Sri Aurobindo's 			
criticism of his own poems and his critical remarks on fellow poetic			
poets like Tagore 			
Then I have uh talked about Aurobindo and how I mean during the			
pre-independence period uh he was uh a a a an Indian			
critic very conscious of his Indianess and uh he knew his western			
 poet and western critics uh but still he has uh great faith in			
the kind of uh new uh poetry that he was writing in epics like uh			
 Savitri 			
Uh yesterday I talked about uh this and so I don't want to			
repeat this 			
The attainment of independence was followed by a certain 			
uneasiness towards English and Indo Eng 			
Anglian literature as it was then called 			
Uh a certain ambivalence of attitude towards English still			
continues though Indo-English literature gained gradual acceptance			
during the late fiftees and the sixtees 			
The rise of the Commonwealth the concept of other literatures			
in English uh the multiplication of uh universities and university			
departments of English are some of the factor that changed the climate			
for the development of Indian writing in English 			
Yesterday also I I referred to the the uh the			
multiplication of university departments of English because of which 			
I mean the Indian writing in English uh got a			
special place uh as far as research is concerned 			
The growth of the thesis industry demanded complete			
exploitation of the nearest and the most easily available area of research			
The increase in the U G C and university supported seminars 			
this is one of them uh conferences journals created a suitable			
climate for intense critical activity in the area of Indian writing in			
English 			
The pioneering work of Professor K R Narsimh uh K R Srinivas			
Iyengar uh in this area opened new vistas of critical studies and			
research 			
First the problem of English as a creative medium was thrashed			
out after tremendous warfare of passions and the value of			
Indo-English literature in the new national context of emergent Indian			
literatures in re regional 			
languages was questioned and after a good deal of uh discussion it			
has been accepted to use Professor Narasimaih's words 			
 not in a not as an exotic plant but as an expression of a			
distinctive sensibility which is Indian 			
I am extremely grateful to the Executive Committee of the			
Indian Association for American studies and to my fellow delegates			
 for electing me to preside over the twenty-seventh annual conference			
As the President of the I A A S I deem it			
my previlege to welcome you all distinguished guests from India and			
abroad delegates members fellow academics from the Goa			
University ladies and gentleman to the twenty-seventh annual			
conference 			
American studies in India had a chequered growth during the			
last forty-five years as Indo-U S relations constantly came under			
the clouds caused by the stresses and strains of international cold			
war 			
American studies in a systematic way leaving it mainly to the			
American funding uh funding agencies or the binational agencies like the			
 USEFI and the A S R C 			
However Indian policy makers have not thought it necessary			
do their own bit to promote American study 			
A facile reason sometimes offered for American studies not being			
considered as an area of study is that it does not require study of a			
foreign language 			
Thus in India and America uh thus India and America are			
separated by common language English 			
Hence outside the J N U I doubt whether there is any University			
in India which has a full fledged centre for study of America 			
In University of Bombay for instance American studies were			
sought to be introduced in the early ninety-sixties 			
nineteen-sixties with the help of University of Pennsylvania			
But the conventional departmental boundary was so strong			
 that Readers recruited to study America got scattered amongst			
the department of history politics and literature rather than			
remain as one unit 			
But since then one person specialising on America in each			
department has not even grown into two contrary to Parkinson's			
 Law 			
This is in contrast to study of the erstwhile Soviet Union 			
What the Indian Americanist have offer often 			
 encountered instead is a charge of being a C I A agent 			
However whenever any discussion has taken place on the question of			
increasing contact between the Indian scholars and their American			
counterparts obviously on the American initiative our educational			
bureaucrats have not hesitated to plead that they too be included in			
the academic exchange programme 			
Be that as it may I've always tried to find answers			
to the question why study the U S ?			
Be its politics or history or literature or culture or			
civilisation 			
There are many reasons which could be advanced to answer the			
question 			
One vital reason is that the U S today has emerged as the			
only veto weilding major power in the United Nation with a will			
power to commit its superior military strength for the collective			
good albeit as it sees it 			
To learn about the U S therefore is to remove our own ignorance			
 so as to enable us to make our policies more effective in achieving			
their goals uh their goals 			
Such ignorance galored in our general public and policy			
makers including law makers 			
Public ignorance deserves to be eliminated but its impact			
on our bilateral relations is indirect 			
But ignorance on the part of policy maker can cause avoidable harm			
to the friendly relations 			
To give one example very few of our policy makers are aware of			
the fact that a segmented governmental structure in the U S cannot			
always act or speak without cacophony 			
Thus in nineteen eighty-three when a few legislators along			
with a very low level state departmental official met some Sikh separatist			
outside the committees home the Indian MP's created an uproar			
 alleging the U S government interference in our internal affairs 			
Another reason is that as a developed political system 			
with a continous history of two hundred and sixteen years I feel			
that the U S can offer us some insight as to how to organise 			
our ever evolving political system 			
This is true of our literature to to some extent 			
Most of those who have contributed a great deal to creative			
work in our regional language uh language literature like Marathi or			
Kannada have themselves been teachers of English or more specifically			
 American literature 			
If I do not venture to mention some names of such creative			
writers it is for the simple reason that I do not wish to generate			
 a controversy from those who are left out as well as those included			
In the area of comparative political systems where I can			
claim some expertise I wish to submit that we can search for some			
answers for our own political problems from the American political			
system and experience 			
There is nothing wrong if we look at the American political system			
for answers to our own problem 			
As the American political experience has given to mankind 			
certain unique political concepts to organise sharing of political power			
like federalism and presidential system 			
The countries of South Asian region for instance look to our			
democratic political experience to develop their own democratic			
institutions 			
Today India as an ancient society attempting to build a modern			
political system is facing three major challenges 			
First communalisation of politics second political instability			
 and third as a consequence of the first two challenges a threat to			
national unity and integrity 			
As India has faced many challenges in the past and somehow 			
managed to survive there is a false complacency that we could overcome			
 present challenges as well 			
But it is my considered opinion that we are sitting on the tip			
of a volcano and it might errupt anytime if corrective steps are			
not taken 			
Hence before these challenges go out of control I strongly feel			
that we need to switch over to uh a presidential system of government			
Tinkering with the existing parliamentary system won't help us			
anymore 			
Presidential government need not be a copy of the American system			
But bio by borrowing essential			
from American system and applying modifications to suit changed times 			
our major political problems can be brought under control 			
India is a multi-regional multi- linguistic and multi-religious			
society 			
This diversity and this uh hetrogenity our founding			
fathers tried to hold together in a parliamentary system within a federal			
structure 			
This was imitative of the British parliamentary system as			
introduced by the Government of India Act nineteen thirty-five 			
This is unlike the American experience after their			
independence from the British colonialism Americans though familiar with			
the British parliamentary system created a unique system of presidential			
government within a federal structure to hold together their			
hetrogenous population 			
The parliamentary system can function well only when there is			
a two party system 			
In a more homogenous society as in Britain Parliamentary			
system add political instability whenever the Labour Party face			
splits as in nineteen twenty-four and nineteen twenty-nine 			
Basic problem with the parliamentary democracy in India is one			
of our failure to develop two or three national political parties 			
With the Indian National Congress inheriting the mantle of glory of			
freedom struggle the congress party enjoyed one party dominions			
nationally 			
But by nineteen sixty-seven there were clear signs that All			
India National Congress was loosing its national character and			
emerging as only vote catching and power sharing device in the uh			
 device 			
In the process the congress developed a pluralistic 			
political majority in different states by putting together dominant caste			
and uh minority community based on coalitions like KHAM Kshatriya			
Harijans Adivasis and Muslims in Gujrat 			
The system of appealing for voters selecting candidates			
 appointing man to executive positions on caste and communal uh			
 basis is the congress strategy to begin with 			
This was only vulgarised by V P Singh in his uh effort to			
develop an alternative to the congress 			
He started with uh MAJGAR Muslims Ahirs Jath Gurjars			
and uh Rajputs coalitions 			
And later tried to expand it by adding the O B C by announcing			
the acceptance of uh recommendations of Mandal now uh Mandal			
Commission 			
The B J P answered it by taking up Mandir Masjid issue and			
trying to bring together highly pluralistic Hindus under their political			
banner 			
Today all political parties from the left to the right are			
basically communal as once asserted by former Justice Krishna			
Iyyer 			
Why this communalisation of political process ?			
It is mainly because in the parliamentary system an M P 			
who aspires to lead the nation as the Prime Minister must command a			
sizable following within the party to be the leader of the legislature			
party 			
To do so Indian leaders have found it easy to appeal on caste			
and communal basis and present themselves as protectors of one or the			
other section of the community instead of developing issues uh issue			
and programme based party 			
In this kind of caste and community based politics power			
sharing blatantly come to uh blatantly has come to be on the 			
bas same basis as the stunt of the caste or community in the			
parliament 			
As a result it is better to be a leader of a small party commanding			
loyalties on a communal basis than to the to be a part 			
of issue based political party 			
When uh too many parties get elected forming a stable			
government becomes difficult and a coalition or a minority government 			
becomes inevitable 			
But from the caste or communal angle a cabinet post in a			
coalition is assured to a caste oriented party rather than when the			
particular caste or community follows the national issue based party 			
This has tended to fragment Indian political parties 			
Thus inspite of the Congress and Janata Dal and others wooing			
scheduled castes they have found it necessary to found their own party			
 Bahujan Samaj Party in U P as Jaths from western U P have come 			
out from the Janata Dal after it lost the power in nineteen ninety 			
Today there are thirty-three political parties all fractions in			
 Lo in the Lok Sabha 			
While the first Lok Sabha after fifty-two election			
 had only five political parties 			
In the process no political party has been able to get a			
rolling majority after nineteen eighty-four elections 			
So long this trend of appealing for votes and post on caste and			
communal basis continues fragmentation of political parties is bound to			
continue 			
The result of communalisation of electoral politics has			
been political has been uh political instability both at the			
states and at the centre 			
Instability in state is not a new phenomenon but political			
instability at the centre is a new phenomenon particularly under the			
Congress party dispensation 			
What has brought this thing at the centre ?			
Clearly the absence of a ruling family 			
Mrs Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi cough tried to maintain			
their individual control over the party and the government through			
the iron rule of political instability uh political destabilisation of			
individual Chief Ministers in the Congress party ruled state whenever			
they showed any one word to independant action 			
Since the end of the Nehru-Gandhi family rule the centre has			
seen political instability as well as uh as well on a day to day			
base 			
It is politics all the way 			
Hence the government has no time to govern 			
If in the past non congress efforts to form the government at			
the centre have invariably ended in the political uh in the vertical splits			
in the ruling party Janata Party in nineteen seventy-nine and the Janata			
Dal in nineteen ninety whether the congress party can avoid it is not			
cleared today 			
In contrast to this American presidential system has been able			
to provide a reasonable degree of political stability 			
Reasonable because after constitution imposed a two term 			
on presidential aspirants after Franklin D Roosevelt was elected for a			
fourth term 			
Only two Eisenhover and Reagan where able to complete eight			
years in the office as against it seven presidents were in the White			
House for less than two terms 			
It still appears reasonable stability when we note that			
Carter in his four year term dealt with three Indian Prime Ministers 			
and Bush in four year saw four Indian Prime Ministers 			
This stability this uh stability in the American system 			
is based on the principle of the separation of powers between the			
executive and legislative branches which has made President co-ordinate			
and independant with Congress in respect of term powers functions			
 and one word 			
President thus enjoys a fixed tenure and cannot be removed by			
the Congress except through impeachment which is extremely difficult and			
rare 			
 First read the Abstract of the paper 			
titled development of grammar in animal communication systems			
 and in pidgins 			
This paper comprises three sections Section one and			
two deal with animal communication systems and 			
Section three with human communication systems 			
To study Animal communication system the Washoe			
project in which a chimpanzee learnt American sign language and			
the Lana Project in which a chimpanzee learns rudimentary			
language-type systems are described 			
The studies prove conclusively that chimpanzee separated			
from humans by a mere genetic whisker are unable to grasp syntax 			
the combination of a finite number of signs in an infinite number of new			
way 			
It separates language from other forms of communication 			
such as Vocalisation facial expression gestures which			
are all paralinguistics features 			
Specifically till date we have no evidence of any animal 			
spontaneously evolving true language without anybody to teach it 			
The only animal who does this is man 			
The focus in section three is on human communication systems			
 specifically how communication takes place among speakers of pidgin			
languages 			
Theories which have been propounded to explain the origins of			
language are explored as The single mutation theory 			
the innate propensity theory the social pressure or need theory and			
the contact theory as they have specific relevance to pidgins			
A dozen examples of Vendor's English 			
domestic's English and Shipee English			
 subsumed under the conventional title of Butler			
English an English pidgin spoken in India for over a century			
 recorded from nineteen eighty-two to nineteen ninety-two are listed			
They reveal modest language competence in pidgin speakers 			
at the levels of morphology syntax and lexico-semantics 			
Extracts from Tay Boi a French pidgin spoken in Vietnam are			
listed 			
Similarities between it and Butler English 			
and English pidgin can be deduced 			
This gives credibility to the claim that all pidgins are			
similar should refer to The innate propensity theory 			
 as they are forged in condition where the premium is on			
transmitting facts withour frills it should refer to The			
social pressure or need theory and The contact			
theory 			
Similarities between the chimpanzee's 			
rudimentary language type system and The pidgin 			
speaker's modest language competence have been noted			
and cross referenced 			
A common thread runs through the three sections of this paper 			
that language serves one basic function that of communication 			
At no point is it suggested that the three sections represent			
 a gradual progression 			
No doubt animal communication systems and human communication			
systems are different for example Instinctive and			
interactive and Innate and interactive 			
 but they are also similar for example limited structures and			
innovative structures 			
Finally the basis for any comparison of cross-species communication			
 is in the final analysis compassion for all forms of life			
 Deve recording broken The paper comprises three			
sections Section one and two deal with animal			
communication systems and Section three with			
human communication system 			
I will concentrate only on the animal communication system 			
First of all what is communication? 			
 Hockett in nineteen sixty defined			
communication as An act by which one individual triggers			
the behaviour of another 			
 S. A. Altmann in nineteen sixty-seven stated			
that communication occurs when the behaviour of one individual 			
affects the behaviour of the other 			
Although this definition is widely accepted by researchers 			
dealing with animal communication it suffers from generality 			
Communicative features may be linguistic or non-linguistic 			
verbal or non-verbal vocal or non-vocal 			
Verbal and non-verbal communication do not represent			
discontiguous processes 			
Both are dependent upon similar complex coding and decoding			
cognitive processes and to the extent that these processes are			
comparable between species the abilities of different species to exchange			
information will also be similar 			
Cognitive styles of perceiving and ordering the world are a			
combined function of an organism's innate neurological equipment			
 and his sensory-motor interactions minus emotion which is			
environmental surroundings 			
Speech is a communication system superimposed on a biological			
process that of breathing 			
Communication systems superimposed on two other essential			
biological processes are that of eating and that of sex 			
Now here are some examples of how birds fish and mammals			
communicate 			
Most of the communicative features are non-linguistic 			
non-verbal and non-vocal 			
I am going to specially talk about versatile behaviour 			
and intentional communication 			
Biologists observing animals have noted that they are capable			
of versatile behaviour and intentional communication which lead us			
to the conclusion that animals can think 			
Here are some striking examples of versatile behaviour from			
 The Hindu nineteen ninety-eight 			
The Galapagos finch uses specially shaped twigs to prise			
out grub from a hole 			
The green-backed heron breaks twigs into small pieces and			
floats them on the water 			
Minnows that are attracted to the twigs end up as lunch 			
When the beaver's dam is damaged and it is forced to			
make emergency repairs it discards familiar techniques if they prove			
futile and tries novel strategies 			
 Termite's nests despite hot temperatures outside			
 maintain a certain level of coolness within 			
When two female gobi fish meet in a corner of a coral reef one			
of them changes into a male so that the two can mate 			
 What's more the male fish can reverse back to a female			
 although not so easily 			
The fish opts for a sex change as a long search for a mate 			
puts them at the mercy of a predators 			
 They are not good swimmers says Phillip Munday			
of the James Cook University of North Queensland in Townsville 			
Japanese researchers support these findings 			
Finally wading birds migrate to New Zealand after breeding			
in Alaska a non-stop trip of eleven thousand kilometres 			
Before they migrate they binge till upto fifty-five percent of			
their weight is fat 			
To compensate for the added weight they destroy a part of			
their internal organ like the kidney and the liver by up to			
twenty-five percent 			
When they land they rebuild them again 			
Now Information Technology is perhaps the			
greatest revolution of this century 			
There is the Internet which links people all over the world			
But would you believe that insects too have a similar communication			
system ? 			
Just as we communicate physically and electronically insects			
communicate through sounds light movement and chemicals 			
I am going to give you some striking examples of intentional			
communication from The Hindu in nineteen			
ninety-eight 			
In the insects communication system the chemical used as a			
communicators are called pheromones from Greek			
 pherien to carry and hormaein 			
to excite 			
The quantity of pheromones used their effective distance and			
specificity all play an important part 			
For example a female sex phor 			
 pheromone can attract the			
male from a distance of two miles or more 			
Male moths fly towards the smell zone which increases as the			
male approaches the female 			
Ants use these pheromones to communicate their message 			
As one or two ants identify the source of food they leave an			
invisible line of pheromones called trail marking			
 pheromones on the ground as they move which			
can be sensed by ants following 			
The ant is so meticulous that it chooses the highly specific			
 pheromone which does not evoke responses from ants			
of other species 			
Thus each possesses its own language and higway code 			
Ants produce a pheromone after their death the odour of which			
immediately provokes worker ant to remove the corpse from the nest			
Some pheromones are used to warn friends of			
intending danger 			
If you disturb an insect in an anthill or a beehive the insect			
disturbed sents off alarm phermones which spread panic through			
the nest 			
Dolphins sometimes referred to as monkeys of the sea they too			
communicate 			
They use unique signature whistles to keep in touch with others			
 that are out of sight says British zoologists			
And this is from The Hindu nineteen			
ninety-seven 			
And do fish talk? 			
In a way they do 			
They tell each other how they feel by the way they wiggle and			
blow bubbles 			
Fish which live at the very bottom of the ocean have a special			
way of communicating they glow with a bright light 			
Some light up to startle their prey others just to say hello to

Dr Cyndy Sims Parr of Michigan states that crows' long			
distance caws of which there are fifteen or twenty have different			
meaning determined by their form and rhythm 			
Various vocalizations can mean stay out of my territory 			
watch out someone's after your lunch or help me get this			
predator out of here 			
She says that a string ko-ko-ko-ko-ko-ko 			
means neighbour you're tresspassing 			
In addition there are the many soft sounds crows make when			
talking with family members like gargles coos squawks squeals 			
and plaintive oo-oo's for example 			
squeal means teasing one another and oo-oo's 			
 are cries of hunger from The Hindu

And now I'll conclude with the dance of the honeybee 			
For it is the dance of the honeybee that constitutes one of the			
most elaborate systems of communication C Russell and W M S			
Russell nineteen seventy-one 			
The dance was first noticed by Pastor Ernst Spitz ner			
 Spitzner in seventeen eighty-eight but it was left to			
an Austrian zoologist Karl Von Frisch to interpret the language of the			
honeybees 			
For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize in nineteen			
seventy-three 			
When a Carniolan honeybee discovers a new source of honey 			
within about ten metres of the hive she returns to the hive and			
regurgitates drops of honey which are eagerly drunk by other bees 			
Then she begins to dance round in a circle this is called 			
the round dance 			
During the round dance the bee runs in small circle 			
clockwise and anti-clock-wise alternately 			
The bees who watch her finds the new source of food 			
The round dance therefore tells other bees to search the near			
neighbourhood of the hive and the scent on the dancers body tells			
them what flowers to look for 			
But honeybees have been known to forage for food at distances			
of thirteen kilometres equivalent of thousand miles for a human being			
So when a honeybee finds food say between hundred metres 			
and hun and hun and ten kilometres she returns to			
the hive offers the honey she has found and performs a			
different kind of number called a tail wagging dance 			
In the case of the waggle dance the bee dances tracing a			
 Figure of eight 			
Like the round dance the waggle dance tells the bee that there			
is food available and what flowers to look for 			
But it also tells them exactly how far away the flowers are and			
in exactly what direction 			
The tempo of the dance conveys the distance to the food a			
quick step tempo indicating a relatively nearby food source and a slow			
foxtrot tempo a more distant one 			
Even all this does not exhaust the language of the honeybee dances			
They can also vary in liveliness and total duration 			
They are livelier and longer the sweeter the food the			
easier it is gathered the better the weather 			
Minute details have been left out such as the waggle dance			
making the same angle with the sun as the honeybee's flight-path			
did a complicated piece of geometrical calculation 			
But even from this brief description it can be inferred that			
the system of communication evolved by the honeybees is marvellous indeed			
Thank you
