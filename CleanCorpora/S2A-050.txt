Back to our  discontinued
""
""
And uh  is the second set of the
market 
""
And when we come to this already we have seen  how the real
sector  and the result of which
is 
""
""
""
Now here we come to 
""
The equilibrium  would ultimately give
diagramatically 
""
And why L M as we know well  money
""
""
Now  as we
did in case of I S curve 
""
But initially  that the monitary sector
equilibrium 
money supply 
""
A very simple kind of an identity  take into
account here 
""
Its a situation wherein 
money demand 
""
So this equality between money supply and money demand  is the
condition of equilibrium here 
""
To put  H to indicate supply of money
 and
this we say is the condition of equilibrium 
""
And this will be our first equation 
""
First equation very simple thing 
""
And now you will find that the rest of this analysis when we
progress 
framework 
""
Almost  your explanation of tension
liquidity preference theory of interest 
""
Much of that 
""
So the matters become quite simple for us 
""
For example as we did last time left side 
""
Now what determines the money supply  ?
""
We  when we
discussed tension theory 
""
What determines the money supply  ?
""
""
The state of reputation 
""
""
 the monetary
authority 
""
So money supply is determined by 
""
""
And it is because of this  any
equation 
no set formula for determining money supply at a time 
""
That is just on the basis of the  that
the monetary authority  goes on contracting or expanding the money supply
""
""
One side is open 
""
And therefore now  every emphasis
will be placed on the demand side 
""
Now when you come to the demand side of money  this demand is
determined by 
""
Three motives 
 B B writing
""
""
And we follow this particular line  uh when you
say  say in general say
transactions 
""
Now when you come to the transactions and precautionary motive 
say broadly 
""
Both are combined together 
""
Now when you take into consideration this one  this
transactions motive  that is liquidity preference for transaction motive
""
""
""
Level of 
""
""
Level of income
""
""
Level of income 
""
It depends on level of income 
""
Now 
money 
""
Level of income 
""
Therefore if you would like to put this by way of impression 
means say M-one 
""
M-one 
""
Now this is 
""
So one part of the total money 
""
Then you come to the second part of it  what
comes now  ?
""
""
Speculate
""
""
Speculative demand 
""
Now speculative  this
depends on  ?
""
""
Rate of interest 
""
""
Correct 
""
And therefore you want of this speculative demand is described as
M-two 
""
The notation M-two has been used by Kens  we
put in that M-two  you can use any notation to
indicate function F or K  that is the
third impression 
""
What we are doing here is just using the tension model of liquidity
preference 
""
And 
in order to give us 
""
Now given this two things equations two and three 
what we know  M-one
plus M-two 
""
This is what we know 
""
If that is so  to put this
in 
""
So we can say then 
in 
""
This and this we would be substituting in equation one 
""
Therefore we say money supply is equal to  let us initially put
M money demand  just derivation every step I would like to put before you
""
""
And M D is uhm one plus M-two 
""
And we know that M-one 
""
So instead of M-one 
its a function of Y 
""
And n place of M-two  put K R its function of rate of interest
""
""
So this  that money
supply  plus a function of
rate of interest 
""
This becomes 
""
As we derived  in case of the real sector
equilibrium 
""
And once you come this  L M
curve 
""
This is the equation of L M curve 
""
So in a simple way we have derived these four equations 
""
Just see the stage by which we have progressed 
""
We began with the fact that the equilibrium in the money market or
money sector  at the rate of interest at which
""
""
Money supply is determined by the monetary authority  at any
given time 
""
Money demand 
""
So you will find here the L comes here  and the M comes on the
other side 
""
The right hand side of this equation is all  liquidity feature
""
""
The left hand side is the money feature 
""
And therefore liquidity money  they are the two dimensions which
are used 
""
In case of liquidity 
M-one 
""
So M-one is a function of Y 
""
Whereas the speculative demand for money M-two  depends on R
""
""
And therefore M-two is a function of R 
""
Naturally substitute these two in one  and ultimately you have
come to this part 
""
So as I said 
""
The right part 
""
And therefore 
""
In graphical terms  liquidity
money curve 
""
So again 
because it is nothing but  by and
large 
""
What you teach in the tensus liquidity preference theory 
""
The same part is used  put in terms of four
equations 
""
Now once we have done this basic exercise  then we go to draw
""
""
And since there are four equations by which we are putting this
 the L M
curve 
""
And therefore in this case  suggest you to
take a 
""
The four 
""
As usual we 
anti-clock fashion 
""
And the direction 
you start from diagram one reach to diagram two  then come to diagram
three 
""
Now to begin with in case of uh 
""
We begin with 
""
The first diagram begins with M-two 
""
So on X-axis you measure M-two  speculative
demand for money 
""
And then on Y-axis what would come  ?
""
""
Rate of interest
""
""
Rate of interest 
""
Now  we would follow the same technique as we did last time
""
""
Taking numerical scales  because the matters become very
simple for our understanding 
""
Just 
""
Now again the second stage that we follow is to have  the
vertical and horizontal faint lines 
""
So that the graph sheet would be ready 
""
And we know here  the speculative
demand for money 
""
Is it positive or negative  ?
""
""
Negative 
""
""
Negative
""
""
Negative 
""
So 
""
That is what 
""
If at all you can add this particular no  L
negative function  the
rate of interest 
""
They have a negative relationship 
""
So naturally as usual you find if the rate of interest is suppose
eight percent  the speculative demand can be just hundred
""
""
If it comes down to seven percent the speculative demand will go
up to two hundred 
""
You move to the right  as you come down on
Y-axis  more the demand for speculative
purpose 
""
So rate of interest if it comes down to six percent  you have
demand three hundred 
""
If it comes to five percent demand is four hundred 
""
And if it comes to four percent  say demand is five percent
""
""
And we join these points 
""
Now this curve can be described as a curve for M-two 
""
M- two curve  demand
functions speculative demand function M-two  rate of
interest 
""
So you have taken care of equation number three here  that is
represented well 
""
Now from there you pass on to equation number uh  the diagram
number two 
""
And as you know that  that
whatever is presented on X-axis in diagram number one  will be repeated on
X-axis in diagram number two 
""
And therefore  you will have M-two
represented 
""
So 
transfered to this 
""
And 
""
So here 
""
""
Now this second diagram  equality
identity 
""
But this identity will represent not simply by saying 
Money supply equal to money demand  with
the help of one which was here  is equal to
""
""
And that  part we will be taking money demand equal to M-one
""
""
And here we assume its certain  which
means money supply 
""
Suppose here we assume  which means
money supply also 
rupees 
""
If we presume this  this graph what would come on
the vertical  ?
""
""
""
""
""
No 
""
You have to concentrate only on that equation 
""
If  speculative
demand for money that is M-two  ?
""
""
Rate of interest
""
""
Rate of interest 
""
""
Where comes the rate of interest in this equation  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Its 
""
""
""
""
This has to be understood correctly and properly 
this can be  while drawing the
diagram 
""
Other things would follow very automatically 
interruptions 
""
No income business should be there  no rate of interest should
be there 
""
Supply of money is equal to demand for money  and demand for
money is broken into two parts M-one plus M-two 
""
If one axis takes care of M-two  the other axis must take care
of  ?
""
""
M-one 
""
""
M-one 
""
See how it comes 
""
But let us put this and have  the diagram ready for drawing
this one 
""
Say M-one which represents  now you are coming to equation
number two  uhm
""
And 
which make up the demand for money and which is equal to supply of money 
""
So that identity can be represented this way 
""
Let us first go for this scale 
""
We follow the same 
""
You can use any numbers 
""
But normally I presume in all classes that the students know
number 
""
So that very easy to go with single digits  if at all a class
like yours is there I presume that you know numbers upto hundred 
""
Uh because calculations orally become very easy
""
The whole thing is that  do not
matter  rupees
 rupees
 whatever you can put
into bracket 
""
So how much amount you put in it 
""
So let us have the horizontal line  points
corresponding to 
""
Now let us see how this comes into 
""
We have presumed that total demand for money is five hundred 
""
And this total demand for money is M-one plus M-two 
""
Now  if I give you
""
and find out the value of M-one 
""
Now let us go this way  if M-two is
hundred  what will be M-one ?
""
""
Four hundred
""
""
Four hundred you know subtraction very well 
""
Then  that both
together will make up five hundred 
""
So  M-one
is four hundred 
""
The transactions demand for money
