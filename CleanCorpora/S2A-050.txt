<I>
Back to our I S L M model that we had discontinued
 last week 
And uh a continuation part of it is the second set of the
market and that was the monitary sector equilibrium 
And when we come to this already we have seen how the real
sector reaches to its equilibrium position and the result of which
is the I S curve 
 We've drawn the I S curve also 
Now here we come to this L M curve 
The equilibrium in the monetary sector would ultimately give
diagramatically the L M curve 
And why L M as we know well L is liquidity M is money
Now following almost the same pattern of explanation as we
did in case of I S curve we can very well present this whole thing 
But initially the proposition is that the monitary sector
equilibrium is reached at the rate of interest at which 
money supply equals money demand 
A very simple kind of an identity you can take into
account here 
Its a situation wherein money supply would be equal to 
money demand 
So this equality between money supply and money demand is the
condition of equilibrium here 
To put briefly then M S H to indicate supply of money
 is equal to M D small letter of capital letter and
this we say is the condition of equilibrium 
And this will be our first equation 
First equation very simple thing 
And now you will find that the rest of this analysis when we
progress would be by and large within the Keyntian 
framework 
Almost much closer to your explanation of tension
liquidity preference theory of interest 
Much of that is adopted here 
So the matters become quite simple for us 
For example as we did last time left side right hand side 
Now what determines the money supply ?
We have already given an answer to this when we
discussed tension theory 
What determines the money supply ?
The state of reputation 
 It's the monetary who determines the monetary
authority 
So money supply is determined by the monetary authority 
 B B writing 
And it is because of this we will not be able to get any
equation so far as money supply is concerned because there is 
no set formula for determining money supply at a time 
That is just on the basis of the needs of the time that
the monetary authority goes on contracting or expanding the money supply
One side is open 
And therefore now for the rest of the thing every emphasis
will be placed on the demand side 
Now when you come to the demand side of money this demand is
determined by B B writing by the tension method 
Three motives three motives haan 
 we'll put in general say by the three motives B B writing
 which govern liquiditive preference 
And we follow this particular line cough uh when you
say after three motives we group together say in general say
transactions and precautionary motives 
Now when you come to the transactions and precautionary motive 
say broadly they will be calling it as transactions motive 
Both are combined together 
Now when you take into consideration this one this
transactions motive that is liquidity preference for transaction motive
 depends on 
Level of 
Level of income
Level of income B B writing 
It depends on level of income 
Now in tension language this transactions demand for 
money is indicated by the term M Y 
Level of income is Y 
Therefore if you would like to put this by way of impression 
means say M-one is a function of income 
M-one is a function of income 
Now this is second equation that you are able to get 
So one part of the total money demand is taken care of 
Then you come to the second part of it and that is what
comes now ?
Speculate
Speculative demand 
Now speculative demand for money B B writing this
depends on ?
Rate of interest 
Correct it depends on rate of interest 
And therefore you want of this speculative demand is described as
M-two 
The notation M-two has been used by Kens and therefore we
put in that M-two is a function of you can use any notation to
indicate function F or K anything is a function of R that is the
third impression 
What we are doing here is just using the tension model of liquidity
preference 
And it's mostly that which Hicks and Henson have used 
in order to give us the monetary sector equilibrium 
Now given this two things equations two and three now 
what we know that M D that demand is equal to M-one
plus M-two B B writing 
This is what we know 
If that is so given this therefore we can say to put this
in equilibrium one or this condition of equilibrium 
So we can say then that substituting B B writing 
in substituting two and three in equation one 
This and this we would be substituting in equation one 
Therefore we say money supply is equal to let us initially put
M money demand just derivation every step I would like to put before you
And M D is uhm one plus M-two 
And we know that M-one is a function of Y 
So instead of M-one if you put in or substitute F Y 
its a function of Y that is income 
And n place of M-two put K R its function of rate of interest
So this you're able to get ultimately that money
supply is equa function of Y plus a function of
rate of interest 
This becomes your equation number four 
As we derived fourth equation in case of the real sector
equilibrium 
And once you come this this is the equation of L M
curve B B writing 
This is the equation of L M curve 
So in a simple way we have derived these four equations 
Just see the stage by which we have progressed 
We began with the fact that the equilibrium in the money market or
money sector would be establishd at the rate of interest at which
 money supply is equal to money demand 
Money supply is determined by the monetary authority at any
given time 
Money demand is determined by liquidity preference 
So you will find here the L comes here and the M comes on the
other side 
The right hand side of this equation is all liquidity feature
The left hand side is the money feature 
And therefore liquidity money they are the two dimensions which
are used 
In case of liquidity the transactions demand for money 
M-one is determined by income level 
So M-one is a function of Y income 
Whereas the speculative demand for money M-two depends on R
 rate of interest 
And therefore M-two is a function of R 
Naturally substitute these two in one and ultimately you have
come to this part 
So as I said the left part denotes M money supply 
The right part determines L the liquidity preference 
And therefore this is an equation of liquidity and money 
In graphical terms it is described as L M curve liquidity
money curve 
So again you find that this part is so easy to present 
because it is nothing but a repetition of tension presentation by and
large 
What you teach in the tensus liquidity preference theory 
The same part is used we've put in terms of four
equations 
Now once we have done this basic exercise then we go to draw
 the diagram 
And since there are four equations by which we are putting this
 we again follow the four diagraphic chart for coming to the L M
curve 
And therefore in this case again I'll suggest you to
take a full page for the diagram 
The four diagrams we will be drawing side by side 
As usual we take up one two three four in an 
anti-clock fashion 
And the direction would be the same as we have now notice 
you start from diagram one reach to diagram two then come to diagram
three and from three you come downwards to diagram four 
Now to begin with in case of uh the first diagram 
We begin with the speculative demand for money M-two 
The first diagram begins with M-two 
So on X-axis you measure M-two which means speculative
demand for money B B writing 
And then on Y-axis what would come ?
Rate of interest
Rate of interest R would be there 
Now we would follow the same technique as we did last time
Taking numerical scales because the matters become very
simple for our understanding B B writing 
Just the usual figures perhaps I've taken 
Now again the second stage that we follow is to have the
vertical and horizontal faint lines 
So that the graph sheet would be ready 
And we know here the relationship between the speculative
demand for money and the rate of interest 
Is it positive or negative ?
Negative 
Negative
Negative 
So M-two is negative function of the rate of interest 
That is what we note in this case also 
If at all you can add this particular no E it is L
negative function M-two is a negative function of R the
rate of interest 
They have a negative relationship 
So naturally as usual you find if the rate of interest is suppose
eight percent quite high the speculative demand can be just hundred
 a quite low demand for speculative purposes 
If it comes down to seven percent the speculative demand will go
up to two hundred 
You move to the right on X-axis as you come down on
Y-axis lower the rate of interest more the demand for speculative
purpose 
So rate of interest if it comes down to six percent you have
demand three hundred 
If it comes to five percent demand is four hundred 
And if it comes to four percent say demand is five percent
And we join these points get a curve 
Now this curve can be described as a curve for M-two 
M- two curve and if you wish to write here the demand
functions speculative demand function M-two is a function of rate of
interest 
So you have taken care of equation number three here that is
represented well 
Now from there you pass on to equation number uh the diagram
number two 
And as you know that the usual way of drawing that
whatever is presented on X-axis in diagram number one will be repeated on
X-axis in diagram number two 
And therefore in this diagram you will have M-two
represented on X-axis 
So let's first have the scale of M-two 
transfered to this B B writing 
And let's have the vertical lines drawn 
So here you have the speculative demand or money 
 B B writing transfered here 
Now this second diagram will take care of the equality
identity money supply equal to money demand 
But this identity will represent not simply by saying 
Money supply equal to money demand but that we would be taking with
the help of one which was here money demand was is equal to
 M-one plus M-two 
And that part we will be taking money demand equal to M-one
 plus M-two 
And here we assume its certain total money demand which
means money supply it equals money supply 
Suppose here we assume that money demand which means
money supply also is five hundred crores of 
rupees 
If we presume this then this graph what would come on
the vertical part of this diagram ?
 It's N 
No 
You have to concentrate only on that equation 
If on X-axis you are able and you have taken speculative
demand for money that is M-two what would come ?
Rate of interest
Rate of interest 
Where comes the rate of interest in this equation ?
 One word 
Its two words 
 Laughs 
This has to be understood correctly and properly because 
this can be an accidence for for any any person while drawing the
diagram 
Other things would follow very automatically 
interruptions laughs 
No income business should be there no rate of interest should
be there 
Supply of money is equal to demand for money and demand for
money is broken into two parts M-one plus M-two 
If one axis takes care of M-two the other axis must take care
of ?
M-one 
M-one laughs 
See how it comes I'll explain to you 
But let us put this and have the diagram ready for drawing
this one 
Say M-one which represents now you are coming to equation
number two which is an equation of M-one uhm
And you are bringing in M-one plus M-two both together 
which make up the demand for money and which is equal to supply of money 
So that identity can be represented this way 
Let us first go for this scale 
We follow the same numbers here easy way to put in 
You can use any numbers B B writing 
But normally I presume in all classes that the students know
number upto ten maximum one to ten 
So that very easy to go with single digits if at all a class
like yours is there I presume that you know numbers upto hundred 
Uh because calculations orally become very easy
The whole thing is that what figures you take do not
matter what this hundred means it can be hundred rupees
 it can be hundred crore of rupees
 hundred million of rupees whatever you can put
into bracket 
So how much amount you put in it is immaterial that 
So let us have the horizontal line to get the points
corresponding to X and Y axis 
Now let us see how this comes into 
We have presumed that total demand for money is five hundred 
And this total demand for money is M-one plus M-two 
Now given this M D equal to five hundred if I give you
 an amount equal to M-two I think you can do some subtraction 
and find out the value of M-one 
Now let us go this way that given that if M-two is
hundred what will be M-one ?
Four hundred
Four hundred you know subtraction very well 
Then sub herein comes the first point that both
together will make up five hundred rupees 
So M-two is hundred and therefore remaining is M-one
is four hundred 
The transactions demand for money
