Back to our  discontinued
""
""
And uh  is the second set of the
""
""
""
""
is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But initially  that the monitary sector
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
money demand 
""
""
condition of equilibrium here 
""
""
 and
""
""
And this will be our first equation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
liquidity preference theory of interest 
""
Much of that 
""
So the matters become quite simple for us 
""
""
""
Now what determines the money supply  ?
""
We  when we
discussed tension theory 
""
What determines the money supply  ?
""
""
The state of reputation 
""
""
 the monetary
authority 
""
So money supply is determined by 
""
""
And it is because of this  any
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now when you come to the demand side of money  this demand is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
transactions motive  that is liquidity preference for transaction motive
""
""
""
Level of 
""
""
Level of income
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
means say M-one 
""
""
""
""
""
So one part of the total money 
""
""
""
""
""
Speculate
""
""
""
""
""
depends on  ?
""
""
Rate of interest 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What we are doing here is just using the tension model of liquidity
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
plus M-two 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore we say money supply is equal to  let us initially put
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
rate of interest 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So in a simple way we have derived these four equations 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So you will find here the L comes here  and the M comes on the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And therefore liquidity money  they are the two dimensions which
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Whereas the speculative demand for money M-two  depends on R
""
""
And therefore M-two is a function of R 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So again 
""
large 
""
What you teach in the tensus liquidity preference theory 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And since there are four equations by which we are putting this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As usual we 
""
""
""
you start from diagram one reach to diagram two  then come to diagram
three 
""
Now to begin with in case of uh 
""
We begin with 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rate of interest
""
""
Rate of interest 
""
Now  we would follow the same technique as we did last time
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
demand for money 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Negative 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If it comes down to seven percent the speculative demand will go
""
""
You move to the right  as you come down on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if it comes to four percent  say demand is five percent
""
""
""
""
""
""
M- two curve  demand
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now from there you pass on to equation number uh  the diagram
""
""
""
whatever is presented on X-axis in diagram number one  will be repeated on
""
""
""
represented 
""
So 
""
""
And 
""
So here 
""
""
""
identity 
""
But this identity will represent not simply by saying 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And here we assume its certain  which
""
""
Suppose here we assume  which means
""
""
""
""
the vertical  ?
""
""
""
""
""
No 
""
You have to concentrate only on that equation 
""
If  speculative
demand for money that is M-two  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
this can be  while drawing the
""
""
Other things would follow very automatically 
interruptions 
""
""
be there 
""
""
money is broken into two parts M-one plus M-two 
""
""
of  ?
""
""
M-one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
this one 
""
""
number two  uhm
""
""
which make up the demand for money and which is equal to supply of money 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So that very easy to go with single digits  if at all a class
""
""
Uh because calculations orally become very easy
""
""
matter  rupees
 rupees
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now let us see how this comes into 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and find out the value of M-one 
""
""
""
""
""
Four hundred
""
""
Four hundred you know subtraction very well 
""
Then  that both
together will make up five hundred 
""
So  M-one
is four hundred 
""
The transactions demand for money
