vibrant creative writer
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Telegraph and Postal Department of India 
""
""
adivasis  they are in
""
""
Presently she is concentrating more 
""
And she draws her inspiration and authentic power  that comes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
five books for children 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
adivasis 
""
Her works have been translated in  Gujarati
""
""
And 
""
""
""
Mahasveta Devi  to have this
opportunity to meet you face to face because we have always  enjoyed that
excellent creative vibrant writing of yours  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 read in the introduction of that excellent book of collection
uh  is it the
""
 is a mm major concern of yours ?
""
But you do not believe as I understand in the change of political
 of the
""
""
""
""
""
Would you suggest  ?
""
""
I think it would be more correct to say  that I don't
""
""
""
And it I  what shall I say wishful thinking
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Only thus 
""
And this work must be done along with those  who have suffered
""
""
This work not only  must be done along with those who have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
upbringing  for the downtrodden and the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
changes and ups and downs in my life
""
""
""
""
""
and  the phrase that has really struck me
""
""
""
""
my people  phrase in a very
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 who was tubercular and who
""
rupees 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm I was wondering 
""
""
""
""
a negative uh  situation in our country in society the immoral unethical
""
""
Uhm  you really think it is
""
""
""
""
""
Or do you think it is the duty of these writer  to present the
""
""
I mean is it one of the work of the writer and if he or she fails
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She does
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or  vary todays writings of the Indian
""
""
The India is passing through many phases passing through many
""
""
""
""
Indian society  that the writers have been very
""
""
Also 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Try to  alleviate the misery of the poor and the suffering as
much as they can 
""
I think  better identification with his
""
""
""
""
""
Because 
""
Not only the writers but  say citizens of India
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
Since you are a writer 
""
""
""
""
""
""
must give back not wait for any one to ask it
""
""
""
""
""
I think uh uh  Mahasveta Devi this is very excellent point
""
""
The other thing I wanted to say in this regard  would you say
""
of us are your admirers 
""
What would you suggest for them  ?
""
""
Whoever is uh aware 
""
Wherever one is  his or her
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She has so many children 
""
The advanced amongst them  totally oblivious
of the misery 
""
Everyone should try to do  whatever one can
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But when they come how do you visualise the quality of life
""
""
""
Hitherto what has happened that uh  oppressed as a class
""
""
""
Especially the tribals 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
struggle as part of Indian history 
""
Thus the tribals have always been bypassed 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
earning 
""
""
value it so much 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
expression of happiness when you are talking about your readers who are non-
""
""
""
""
""
""
gratification  and love from them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Chourasia ki Maa

""
Different kind of literature 
""
""
""
""
He not only published my books by going forward travelling to
""
hi 
""
Hindi writers poets  so many people
""
""
It was like a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Hindi introduced me to 
""
I agree this 
""
""
""
""
""
Amongst the Indian writers I have so many friends 
""
For all these things I am very very indebted to the Hindi
literature  very very indebted to Arvind Kumar
""
""
""
""
There is just probably a little time for you to share any
""
""
""
""
important to me 
""
In a remote tribal area of Bengal  twenty years ago there was
""
""
""
""
""
land they had 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 a great one a
""
""
And I always say that school  it will
""
""
I do not know 
""
""
""
""
""
But Karmisuren is a great woman  whose life should be written
