<I>
This morning we have with us Mahasveta Devi the
eminent Bengali writer visiting Delhi 
Mahasveta Devi was born in Dhaka which is now in Bangladesh and
pursued her academic career in Vishwabharati Shantiniketan
 and also later in the Calcutta University
Interestingly she did her M A in English literature 
Mahasveta Devi is a social activist a journalist and a
vibrant creative writer
She has taught at school and college level English literature
Also she has been a roving reporter of two Bengali dailies 
 Vartuman and Yugantur mainly
reporting on the matters related to villages 
She is also a person who has a store house of varied experiences
because she has garner them from the different areas of life 
It is interesting to know for us that she has also worked in the
Telegraph and Postal Department of India 
She has been working clears throat with the 
adivasis of India working with them and they are in
Orissa Bihar and Bengal 
Presently she is concentrating more in Bengal 
And she draws her inspiration and authentic power that comes
from empathy and deep sustained identification and concern for the deprived
and the neglected 
She has to her credit forty-two novels sixteen books of
collected short stories 
A book of plays amongst which we can very happily name the
 uh Hazar Chaurasia's Maa 
five books for children 
She has also received several medals
And it is a big list to go through but let me mention the
 Amrita Puraskaar Jagataruni Medal 
Nikhil Bharat Bang Sahitya Puraskaar Bhuvan Mohini Medal
 and also Padmashree in
nineteen eighty-six for her excellent work with the 
adivasis of India 
Her works have been translated in Malyali Gujarati
 Hindi Telugu Tamil and certainly in English 
And I'm very happy to tell you as far as I know 
her books are used in several universities in Australia and the
United States 
Mahasveta Devi it is great pleasure to have this
opportunity to meet you face to face because we have always enjoyed that
excellent creative vibrant writing of yours and we all welcome you in
 Delhi and to our studio 
Thank you 
Uhm the question that comes to mind right away and which
 I've read in the introduction of that excellent book of collection
uh Apni Godko is it the
transformation in society for survival of the least and the downtrodden
 is a mm major concern of yours ?
But you do not believe as I understand in the change of political
 methods or cha change of the
system by political methods 
What would be your solution for this very pressing problem in our
country this transformation of society ?
Would you suggest it can be done through literary writing ?
I think it would be more correct to say that I don't
think any political system as we see in India would bring 
any revolutionary change for the downtrodden and the oppressed 
And it I it would be very what shall I say wishful thinking
to say that only literary writing could bring some changes 
Of course it will have some effect on the 
litery literary section of the society 
But to bring any transformation efforts should
try should be tried 
You know from the grass root level not from the upper level
And the process will be slow process will be gradual and
there must be concerted efforts to better the condition of the
downtrodden the oppressed 
I don't mean always by government methods 
By voluntary organisations or other dedicated people 
Only thus slowly uh better society can emerge 
And this work must be done along with those who have suffered
This work not only must be done along with those who have
suffered but the initiative also must come from them 
They will work for their own betterment 
Uh how much have you been impressed by your 
Shantiniketan experience in this uh thought for the 
downtrodden the deprived the neglected ?
I wouldn't say that Shantiniketan 
upbringing made me very conscious for the downtrodden and the
oppressed 
I was in Shantiniketan in my childhood when
Tagore was alive 
 I'm very thankful for those childhood days 
 Shantiniketan taught me a great love of
nature love for humanity in general 
But the later phase which is me now it has come after many
changes and ups and downs in my life
And you have had a varied experience in your life 
Please tell us you often use in your writing my people 
and that's the phrase that has really struck me
Because I have come across it several times 
I would like to know what exactly do you mean when you say 
my people you do you use this phrase in a very
particular way or as queens and kings use my people
No the for the queens and kings it would be my
subject 
But for me the suffering bonded labourers of Paramu they are
my people 
 The Times of India report regarding a woman
 three months ago in Madhya Pradesh who was tubercular and who
sold her daughter for as a child labour for hundred 
rupees 
 She's one of my people 
You see my India consists of such people who for whom
still drinking water or right over their land and forest a hut
 two meals a day remains a luxury 
They are my people 
Where I say people I mean they 
And this is your sustained deep identification with this
particular group
Yes 
Uhm I was wondering when you say that you are 
sensitive about the judgement on the writers you have also said that
they are answerable the writers 
I was going to ask you is a writer responsible for the state of
a negative uh situation in our country in society the immoral unethical
values ?
Uhm are do you really think it is
the job of the writer to reflect the society ?
Because we have been saying for ages literature is the
mirror of society 
Or do you think it is the duty of these writer to present the
 picture truthfully but also work for the solution ?
I mean is it one of the work of the writer and if he or she fails
there that she should be ready for judgement ?
What I wanted to say I put it to you as a counter 
 it's not question some thing else 
A writer is a person who lives in the society
She does
A writer receives so much from society but he is also
accountable to the society 
He has also give given that so a 
writer's writing should not lead the society astray 
Or a writer's vary todays writings of the Indian
writers from all over India does it reflect the true India ?
The India is passing through many phases passing through many
changes 
So uh d d do it lit the Indian literature
until and unless becomes the mirror of the Indian changing
Indian society I wouldn't say that the writers have been very
successful 
Also I believe in activism 
I believe in active work 
So I think this these writers also
should be conscious of their res social
responsibilities 
Try to alleviate the misery of the poor and the suffering as
much as they can 
I think this should give him better identification with his
reading public
This is a very very excellent point
Because very few I think feel 
Not only the writers but let's say citizens of India
 that we have received so much from society therefore we are bound to
 them to give back in whatever way we can
And what you are saying as a writer it is one of your duties that
you consider is to get back as much as you can
Yes
Since you are a writer 
So that some wrong impression that we have that because she is
an activist therefore she is always bringing in these subjects is not
such a true picture as the moral and ethical value have as a writer
That a writer as a citizen writer as a taker of social good 
must give back not wait for any one to ask it
Yes
I think uh uh Mahasveta Devi this is very excellent point
and I am happy that you are sharing this with us 
The other thing I wanted to say in this regard would you say
then the readers who read your work really owe it to you because many
of us are your admirers that they also do something actual work 
What would you suggest for them ?
Whoever is uh aware 
Wherever one is he must consider it as his or her
battlefield jo jidher hai wohi unke liye unaka ranakshetra hai
 
One must think of oneself as a soldier 
You see our India is a very poor mother 
She has so many children 
The advanced amongst them should not be totally oblivious
of the misery of her poorer children 
Everyone should try to do whatever one can
Uhm I'm sure we'll remember that 
Mahasveta Devi I wanted to ask you please share with us and I
see in not uh far away future those who you are working for the
 adivasis the neglected the uh forgotten will come into
the mainstream of life 
I can't prophecy when but they will 
But when they come how do you visualise the quality of life
changing atleast beginning to change ?
Hitherto what has happened that uh oppressed as a class
the tribals amongst us have been totally bypassed by the 
mainstre mainstream society 
Especially the tribals 
Great injustice has been done to them
Absolutely 
Indian history of uh freed Indian freedom
history does not include the tribal anti-imperialist uh
struggle as part of Indian history 
Thus the tribals have always been bypassed 
I do not want them to come forward because of mercy from
the main stream 
They must know where they are
They must struggle for their own good and they must 
advance themselves 
Only thus whatever they are that will be his or her own
earning that is she will be able to retain 
If you give someone something yes one may not
value it so much 
 Yes 
Ah this is a very excellent point
I wanted to say that I have noticed that you have a 
expression of happiness when you are talking about your readers who are non-
Bengali readers 
And I know that you are very well known amongst the
 non-Bengali readers through translations 
I wanted to ask you to what do you owe this 
gratification and love from them
 One or two words 
That is one of the turning phases of my life 
Because by the time I had written Hazar
Chourasia ki Maa I had written Jungle 
Ke Jahagirdar 
But those books were not yet translated into Hindi 
Hindi in Hindi plenty Bengali literature was being
translated and published 
But not my books 
Different kind of literature 
Arvind kumar now the director of L B T then he had
 Radhakrishna Prakashan 
He not only published my books by going forward travelling to
Calcutta but introduced me to a people unknown to me hi
hi hitherto 
Hindi writers poets patrakars so many people
I met in Delhi 
It was like a mela 
Whenever I came I met them 
It was like a festive occasion 
On one occasion there was really a mela like
festival around me in Triveni 
Arvind one word and had I not known Hindi 
readers had I not known the Hindi world of literature I would not
have known greater India 
Hindi introduced me to greater India 
I agree this I'm no longer I do no longer feel 
I'm a Bengali writer
I feel I am a Indian writer and I belong to the rest of India
Amongst the Indian writers I have so many friends 
For all these things I am very very indebted to the Hindi
literature very very indebted to Arvind Kumar
So we now see the great value of translation 
There is just probably a little time for you to share any
particular thought that is dear to your heart with your audience 
I will just tell you a very small incident which is very
important to me 
In a remote tribal area of Bengal twenty years ago there was
no school 
And because there was no land available to build a hut for the
school a tribal woman Karmisuren she had very little land she
induced interest upon her son and daughter-in-law to part with whatever
land they had 
This poorest woman in the village gave her all 
An illiterate woman so that a school could could be built 
for others to get education 
 Karmisuren's instance till date is a great one a
pioneering effect to me 
And I always say that school I think it will be it will
be government sanctioned very soon
I do not know 
We are trying hard 
My state government is also trying trying hard 
But Karmisuren is a great woman whose life should be written
 and should reach other parts of India
And I would add let us also act like Karmisuren and
Mahasveta Devi thank you for spending this beautiful time with us 
Thank you so much
