This morning we have with us  the
eminent Bengali writer visiting Delhi 
""
Mahasveta Devi was born in Dhaka which is now in Bangladesh  and
pursued her academic career in  Shantiniketan
 later in the Calcutta University
""
Interestingly she did her 
""
Mahasveta Devi is a social activist  and a
vibrant creative writer
""
She has taught  at school and college level English literature
""
""
Also she has been a roving reporter of two Bengali dailies 
 mainly
reporting on the matters related to villages 
""
She is also a person who has a store house of varied experiences
because she has garner them 
""
It is interesting to know for us  that she has also worked in the
Telegraph and Postal Department of India 
""
She has been working 
adivasis  they are in
Orissa Bihar and Bengal 
""
Presently she is concentrating more 
""
And she draws her inspiration and authentic power  that comes
from empathy and deep sustained identification and concern for the deprived
and the 
""
She has to her credit forty-two novels  sixteen books of
collected short stories 
""
A book of plays  very happily name the
""
five books for children 
""
She has also received several medals
""
And  it is a big list to go through but let me mention the
""
Nikhil Bharat Bang Sahitya Puraskaar  Medal
 in
nineteen eighty-six 
adivasis 
""
Her works have been translated in  Gujarati
""
""
And 
her books are used  in Australia and the
United States 
""
Mahasveta Devi  to have this
opportunity to meet you face to face because we have always  enjoyed that
excellent creative vibrant writing of yours  in
""
""
""
Thank you 
""
""
Uhm the  question that comes to mind right away and which
 read in the introduction of that excellent book of collection
uh  is it the
transformation in society  for survival of the least and the downtrodden
 is a mm major concern of yours ?
""
But you do not believe as I understand in the change of political
 of the
system by political methods 
""
What would be your solution for this very pressing problem in our
country this transformation of society ?
""
Would you suggest  ?
""
""
I think it would be more correct to say  that I don't
think 
any 
""
And it I  what shall I say wishful thinking
to say 
""
Of course it will 
litery 
""
But  should
try 
""
You know  not from the upper level
""
""
And the process will be slow  and
there must be  to better the condition of the
downtrodden the oppressed 
""
I don't mean always by government methods 
""
By voluntary organisations or other dedicated people 
""
Only thus 
""
And this work must be done along with those  who have suffered
""
""
This work not only  must be done along with those who have
suffered 
""
They will work for their own betterment 
""
""
Uh how much have you 
Shantiniketan 
downtrodden the deprived the neglected ?
""
""
I wouldn't say that 
upbringing  for the downtrodden and the
oppressed 
""
I was in  in my childhood when
Tagore was alive 
""
""
""
 a great love of
nature 
""
But the later phase  it has come after many
changes and ups and downs in my life
""
""
And you have had a varied experience in your life 
""
Please tell us 
and  the phrase that has really struck me
""
Because I have come across it several times 
""
I would like to know what exactly do you mean when you say 
my people  phrase in a very
particular way or as  my people
""
""
No  for the queens and kings it would be my
subject 
""
But for me  the suffering bonded labourers of Paramu they are
my people 
""
 report regarding a woman
 who was tubercular and who
sold her daughter 
rupees 
""
""
""
You see my India consists of such people  for whom
still  a hut
""
""
They are my people 
""
Where I say people 
""
""
And this is your sustained  deep identification with this
particular group
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uhm I was wondering 
sensitive about the judgement  that
they are answerable the writers 
""
I was going to ask you  is a writer responsible for the state of
a negative uh  situation in our country in society the immoral unethical
values  ?
""
Uhm  you really think it is
the job of the writer  to reflect the society ?
""
Because we have been saying for ages  literature is the
mirror of society 
""
Or do you think it is the duty of these writer  to present the
 picture truthfully but also work for the solution ?
""
I mean is it one of the work of the writer and if he or she fails
there that she should be ready for judgement  ?
""
""
What I wanted to say 
""
""
A writer is a person who lives in the society
""
""
She does
""
""
A writer receives  but he is also
accountable to the society 
""
He has also 
writer's 
""
Or  vary todays writings of the Indian
writers from all over India  ?
""
The India is passing through many phases passing through many
changes 
""
So  the Indian literature
until and unless  changing
Indian society  that the writers have been very
successful 
""
Also 
""
I believe in active work 
""
So I think  writers also
should be  social
responsibilities 
""
Try to  alleviate the misery of the poor and the suffering as
much as they can 
""
I think  better identification with his
reading public
""
""
This is a very very excellent point
""
Because 
""
Not only the writers but  say citizens of India
 to
 give back in whatever way we can
""
And what you are saying as a writer it is one of your duties that
you consider is to get back as much as you can
""
""
Yes
""
""
Since you are a writer 
""
So that some wrong impression that we have  that because she is
an activist therefore she is always bringing in  these subjects is not
such a true picture as the  moral and ethical value have as a writer
""
That a writer as a citizen 
must give back not wait for any one to ask it
""
""
Yes
""
""
I think uh uh  Mahasveta Devi this is very excellent point
and I am happy that you are sharing this with us 
""
The other thing I wanted to say in this regard  would you say
then  really owe it to you because many
of us are your admirers 
""
What would you suggest for them  ?
""
""
Whoever is uh aware 
""
Wherever one is  his or her
battlefield  jo jidher hai wohi unke liye unaka ranakshetra hai
""
""
One must 
""
You see our India is a very poor mother 
""
She has so many children 
""
The advanced amongst them  totally oblivious
of the misery 
""
Everyone should try to do  whatever one can
""
""
Uhm 
""
Mahasveta Devi I wanted to ask you please share with us  and I
see in not uh  you are working for the
 uh forgotten will come into
the mainstream of life 
""
I can't prophecy when but they will 
""
But when they come how do you visualise the quality of life
changing atleast beginning to change  ?
""
""
Hitherto what has happened that uh  oppressed as a class
the tribals amongst us 
mainstre 
""
Especially the tribals 
""
Great injustice has been done to them
""
""
Absolutely 
""
""
Indian history  Indian freedom
history  uh
struggle as part of Indian history 
""
Thus the tribals have always been bypassed 
""
I do not want  because of mercy from
the main stream 
""
They must know where they are
""
They must struggle for their own good 
advance themselves 
""
Only thus  whatever they are that will be his or her own
earning 
""
If you give someone something  one may not
value it so much 
""
""
""
""
""
Ah this is a very excellent point
""
I wanted to say that 
expression of happiness when you are talking about your readers who are non-
Bengali readers 
""
And I know that you  well known amongst the
""
""
I wanted to ask you 
gratification  and love from them
""
""
""
""
""
That is one of the 
""
Because  Hazar
Chourasia ki Maa 
Ke Jahagirdar 
""
But those books were not yet translated into Hindi 
""
Hindi  was being
translated and published 
""
But not my books 
""
Different kind of literature 
""
Arvind kumar  then he had
""
""
He not only published my books by going forward travelling to
Calcutta  hi
hi 
""
Hindi writers poets  so many people
I met in Delhi 
""
It was like a 
""
Whenever I came 
""
It was like a festive occasion 
""
On one occasion there was really a  like
festival around me 
""
Arvind 
readers  I would not
have known greater India 
""
Hindi introduced me to 
""
I agree this 
I'm  a Bengali writer
""
I feel I am a Indian writer  and I belong to the rest of India
""
""
Amongst the Indian writers I have so many friends 
""
For all these things I am very very indebted to the Hindi
literature  very very indebted to Arvind Kumar
""
""
So we now see the great value of translation 
""
There is just probably a little time for you to share any
particular thought that is dear to your heart with your audience 
""
""
I will just tell you a very small incident  which is very
important to me 
""
In a remote tribal area of Bengal  twenty years ago there was
no school 
""
And because there was no land available to build a hut for the
school  she
induced  interest upon her son and daughter-in-law to part with whatever
land they had 
""
This poorest woman in the village 
""
An illiterate woman 
for others to get education 
""
 a great one a
pioneering effect to me 
""
And I always say that school  it will
be government sanctioned very soon
""
I do not know 
""
We are trying hard 
""
My state government is also trying trying hard 
""
But Karmisuren is a great woman  whose life should be written
 other parts of India
""
""
And I would add let us also act like Karmisuren  and
Mahasveta Devi thank you for spending this beautiful time with us 
""
Thank you so much
