Hello everybody  and I would like to
speak 
""
First we have to know what exactly is Indian Culture  ?
""
Indian Culture  the
spiritual life of a person  spiritual mentality of a person
""
""
Now  with the other
cultures  one of the ancient
and the oldest and the topmost and the critical culture 
""
Now we should know  ?
""
And what exactly is the art  ?
""
Culture  a way of
life 
""
But  totally
we are going in a different concept 
""
That culture  I'm
""
""
 not only
one of the most ancient  most extensive and
varied 
""
Uh  uh throughout the
ages  come
into contact with India or have permanently settled within  her borders
 joining the lines of her children and helping to evolve a distinctive
Indian culture 
""
The key note of which is synthesis on the bases of the eternal
values 
""
Now  that
Indian Culture  more than
four thousand  that is including Indus Valley Civilisation
""
""
Now the Indian culture was laid  and of the China the Buddhist
movements which tried to spread their accumulated spiritual wealth among the
masses 
""
That actually is the foundation of the  uh two great ideals of
India  that is synthesis of culture and spiritual regeneration of a man
""
""
Uh  truely
laid in these early phases from which the future structure of  India's
""
""
As a matter of fact  uhn the great culture of India is basically
a synthesis 
""
You know a synthesis of not only  uh
speech and uh  of
which their different speeches are outward expressions  as well as the
""
spiritual which gives ideologies and determine attitudes and actions 
""
The 
it 
because man in any area any area of the world is the product of  as much
of his geographical and economic environment as of his  racial and
cultural bearings and movings 
""
No culture or civilisation  now this is actually going to be a
important point  whenever we speak of culture this is going to be a very
very important point 
""
No culture or civilisation  have come into being in any country
and at any age in a completed and a perfected form 
""
Like an Athena coming out of full grown and fully armed from the
head of the divinity vision 
""
You know 
""
Now man is for ever becoming  and like all things within and uh
""
""
Uhm  to
India 
""
Uh India some would prefer to describe it in other way  as the
expression of a basic and original  uh what do you call
it as uh  we
can say it as manifestations 
""
This  other way of looking at the matter has something
attractive in it for those who believe in a progressive  uh degeneration
from a golden age of their imagination 
evolution through the ages 
""
But in fact  it is a case
of unity gradually becoming established out of diverse and uh  contending
elements 
""
Uhm and the first human  habitants
 that actually they represented various different
races  whose origins and whose language and basic cultures when started
were different from each other 
""
It was not totally a different uh  altogether from square one
""
""
It is from differnt squares 
""
Now let us come to 
""
Here  the foundation of
this Indian way of life is totally Indian culture 
""
Now the  considering the vast
amount of uh  like your name
in our knowledge of India 
""
In the formative period of our culture  it will not be possible
for us to obtain the full picture  out of a welter of race and movements
 we can only
see dimly the gradual establishment of a way of thought  know and the way
of life that we can associate it with india  uh as a distinct entity among
geographical units 
""
The various races follow each other as a face to sequence  that
is  making ultimately for that richness of life and experience and
thought and spiritual prospective  that are in the civilisation and the
culture and uh 
""
The  neolithical negroids from Africa the protoastroloids and
 and the
mongoloids from Far East 
""
No but  who appear to have
brought  and
Indo-Europeans in their various elements racial and linguistic  all
these things counts a lot 
""
Now Indian way of life as it emerged with a birth of the Indian man
 which took place as the
result of  they say that uh the mythology and uh
""
the mongoloids the ostroids and the dravidians and Indo-Aryans and the
Indo-Europeans 
""
This this is going to be a very 
""
Now  it
was the period of large scale tribal movements and racial 
""
""
In the  I wanted to
tell you one thing  exactly based
on the  Upanishads
""
""
Uh in a well known Rigvedic hymn  describing the
battle fought by the Indo-Aryan king  the confederacy
of ten kings 
""
Actually they were uh 
""
Harikrishna Dev he is one of the well known 
""
""
He said he had suggested with great  plausibility that the
tribes mentioned in the Rigveda were the same as those mentioned in the
Egyptian documents 
""
And uh  external influences from the
near East was not absent even in the ancient period of 
emergence 
""
And uhm  would identify
the farmer with the people known to Egyptians as  the Purasati
who were the same as the 
""
And uh  convincing but nevertheless noteworthy
""
Shatpata Brahman 
""
Now all this  mentioning the Sanskrit
names is totally based on the Indian culture 
""
Indian culture actually  I'm
 its each and every brick of our Indian
culture 
""
Now until recently  it was generally admitted that Vedic
Sanskrit was the oldest Indo-Aryan language as far as the Indian culture was
concerned 
""
Uh 
that uh  of
the language of the Hitites  has brought forth the history of the
Indo-European and the 
visitor 
""
This would make the ancient Greek language interior to the 
Vedic by atleast a couple of countries 
""
So  we can come to a
conclusion  actually it was not brought up on
its own 
through the 
""
That means  before Indian culture
 who have developed
their own cultures  and their own systems and their own way of life and
their own  uh expressing
themselves 
""
Now 
""
Now we should look upon the  pilgrims programmes of humanity as
being essentially one  uh which mankind has
undertaken 
""
Ever since man became conscious of his intellectual heritage 
India in its own way 
in formulating this 
""
From the very fact that  its
genesis as a people I am specifying here  had to take note
of the thoughts  of so many
different people so many 
what we can say that uh  that
would be  all embracing spirit
""
That means  which welcomes all the
cultures and all the concepts 
""
And that is what it has  that is what has given the basic tone
or colour to the  representing a great
synthesis 
""
So this synthesis word actually I have already mentioned  that
Indian culture it is the synthesis 
""
And it is philosophical  as well as spiritual and mystical
synthesis  is the sum
total of the  with the
great ideals of uh  the Vedas and the Upanishads and looming in the
background 
""
The aspiration and the way of life as proposed by this culture and
 the
entire mankind 
""
It can be  form
 from earlier Indian literature
actually I am  from one of the
""
""
It says thus  wise men
speak of it in many ways 
""
Now this  is
one 
""
And uh  to cultivate that
which is good  cultivate
graciousness 
""
Now when we observe 
""
 the
base is very broad  that uh broad
single base  and the
different religions  been constructed that
different philosophies have been constructed and different concepts have been
constructed 
""
Now  we should
look at the  on the development
""
""
Now  the cultural
development of any country  take
it out the general this thing 
""
In studying the cultural development of any country  the
importance of uh  okay it can can hardly be
minimised  early periods of human history geography determine
to a great extent to the  uh activities of the
people as well as their thought and literature 
""
Now  tell you geography shaped history largely than uh
 though in a different manner
""
""
Man has been independent on the physical facts of nature but  he
has not been content to live under these limitation 
""
And he has always driven progressively to break through the
barriers placed by the nature 
""
And uh  to this
point 
""
So this interplay  the
forces of geography and human will 
""
Actually it is uh indeed  and
""
""
Now  what shall we say
evaluate  uh enhance the influence of Indian
geography and the culture  one hand and how the
challenge of geography has also been met on the other 
""
Now let us come to physical facts 
""
Now this physical facts uh  which have uh directly or
indirectly  and it has
been the size of the country and its comparative isolation 
afforded by
