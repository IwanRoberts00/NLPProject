Hello everybody  and I would like to
""
""
First we have to know what exactly is Indian Culture  ?
""
Indian Culture  the
""
""
""
""
cultures  one of the ancient
""
""
Now we should know  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That culture  I'm
""
""
 not only
""
""
""
""
ages  come
""
""
Indian culture 
""
""
values 
""
""
Indian Culture  more than
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
India  that is synthesis of culture and spiritual regeneration of a man
""
""
""
laid in these early phases from which the future structure of  India's
""
""
""
a synthesis 
""
You know a synthesis of not only  uh
speech and uh  of
""
""
""
""
The 
it 
""
of his geographical and economic environment as of his  racial and
cultural bearings and movings 
""
No culture or civilisation  now this is actually going to be a
""
very important point 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now man is for ever becoming  and like all things within and uh
""
""
Uhm  to
India 
""
Uh India some would prefer to describe it in other way  as the
""
""
can say it as manifestations 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that actually they represented various different
""
""
""
It was not totally a different uh  altogether from square one
""
""
It is from differnt squares 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 we can only
""
""
""
""
""
is  making ultimately for that richness of life and experience and
""
""
""
""
""
mongoloids from Far East 
""
No but  who appear to have
""
Indo-Europeans in their various elements racial and linguistic  all
""
""
Now Indian way of life as it emerged with a birth of the Indian man
""
result of  they say that uh the mythology and uh
""
the mongoloids the ostroids and the dravidians and Indo-Aryans and the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
on the  Upanishads
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uhm  would identify
""
who were the same as the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sanskrit was the oldest Indo-Aryan language as far as the Indian culture was
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Indo-European and the 
""
""
""
""
""
So  we can come to a
conclusion  actually it was not brought up on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now we should look upon the  pilgrims programmes of humanity as
""
undertaken 
""
""
India in its own way 
""
""
From the very fact that  its
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
cultures and all the concepts 
""
And that is what it has  that is what has given the basic tone
or colour to the  representing a great
""
""
""
""
""
And it is philosophical  as well as spiritual and mystical
""
total of the  with the
""
""
""
""
""
entire mankind 
""
It can be  form
""
actually I am  from one of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
base is very broad  that uh broad
single base  and the
""
different philosophies have been constructed and different concepts have been
""
""
Now  we should
""
""
""
Now  the cultural
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
people as well as their thought and literature 
""
Now  tell you geography shaped history largely than uh
 though in a different manner
""
""
""
has not been content to live under these limitation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  what shall we say
""
""
challenge of geography has also been met on the other 
""
""
""
Now this physical facts uh  which have uh directly or
""
""
afforded by
