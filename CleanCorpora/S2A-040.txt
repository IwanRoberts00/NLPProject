Hello everybody my name is Ramesh and I would like to
speak about Indian Culture and Indian Art 
First we have to know what exactly is Indian Culture ?
Indian Culture flips the whole and soul of the the
spiritual life of a person or the spiritual mentality of a person
Now when we compare the Indian culture with the other
cultures Indian culture is considered as the one of the ancient
and the oldest and the topmost and the critical culture of the world 
Now we should know what exactly is the culture ?
And what exactly is the art ?
Culture as far as India is concerned is a way of
life 
But the way we are culturing it now that is totally
we are going in a different concept 
That culture is totally apart from the culture what I'm
 going to speak 
 India's cultural heritage actually it's not only
one of the most ancient but it is also one of the most extensive and
varied 
Uh tu it has contributed uh throughout the
ages many races and people uh who have either temporarily come
into contact with India or have permanently settled within her borders
 joining the lines of her children and helping to evolve a distinctive
Indian culture 
The key note of which is synthesis on the bases of the eternal
values 
Now it gives us glimpses of Vedic Civilisation that
Indian Culture which is having a history of four thousand more than
four thousand years ago that is including Indus Valley Civilisation
Now the Indian culture was laid and of the China the Buddhist
movements which tried to spread their accumulated spiritual wealth among the
masses and classes of the country 
That actually is the foundation of the uh two great ideals of
India that is synthesis of culture and spiritual regeneration of a man
Uh it have has been uh truely
laid in these early phases from which the future structure of India's
 culture has been raised 
As a matter of fact uhn the great culture of India is basically
a synthesis 
You know a synthesis of not only blood and race but also uh
speech and uh what uh we can say the ways of thinking of
which their different speeches are outward expressions as well as the
 cultures that is material culture and intellectual culture and 
spiritual which gives ideologies and determine attitudes and actions 
The uh geographical background actually it uh 
it it should also be taken into consideration 
because man in any area any area of the world is the product of as much
of his geographical and economic environment as of his racial and
cultural bearings and movings 
No culture or civilisation now this is actually going to be a
important point whenever we speak of culture this is going to be a very
very important point 
No culture or civilisation have come into being in any country
and at any age in a completed and a perfected form 
Like an Athena coming out of full grown and fully armed from the
head of the divinity vision 
You know that's a actually a story 
Now man is for ever becoming and like all things within and uh
 his affairs are ever in a state of flux 
Uhm now let us come to let us jurisdict ourselves to
India 
Uh India some would prefer to describe it in other way as the
expression of a basic and original univa uni uh what do you call
it as uh the universal uh unity in its various uh uhm we
can say it as manifestations 
This other way of looking at the matter has something
attractive in it for those who believe in a progressive uh degeneration
from a golden age of their imagination rather than in the in uh 
evolution through the ages 
But in fact in the face of the observed facts it is a case
of unity gradually becoming established out of diverse and uh contending
elements 
Uhm and the first human habi habitants
 of India that actually they represented various different
races whose origins and whose language and basic cultures when started
were different from each other 
It was not totally a different uh altogether from square one
It is from differnt squares 
Now let us come to the evolution of Indian way of life 
Here this Indian way of life is totally the foundation of
this Indian way of life is totally Indian culture 
Now the uh as a matter of fact considering the vast
amount of uh uh what literally we say it is uh like your name
in our knowledge of India 
In the formative period of our culture it will not be possible
for us to obtain the full picture out of a welter of race and movements
 and of the ideological exchanges for mens and uh we can only
see dimly the gradual establishment of a way of thought know and the way
of life that we can associate it with india uh as a distinct entity among
geographical units and uh you know human innocence 
The various races follow each other as a face to sequence that
is making ultimately for that richness of life and experience and
thought and spiritual prospective that are in the civilisation and the
culture and uh uh the basic uh ethics of India 
The neolithical negroids from Africa the protoastroloids and
 ostroids people and probably if may know that is from Asia and the
mongoloids from Far East 
No but congeries of Asian peoples who appear to have
brought the dravidian language and culture to India and
Indo-Europeans in their various elements racial and linguistic uh all
these things counts a lot 
Now Indian way of life as it emerged with a birth of the Indian man
 I'm I'm specifing here Indian man which took place as the
result of uhm uhm what uh they say that uh the mythology and uh
 histories of the India at the time of the Aryans that is 
the mongoloids the ostroids and the dravidians and Indo-Aryans and the
Indo-Europeans 
This this is going to be a very very huge list 
Now the second half of the second millenium that is B C it
was the period of large scale tribal movements and racial one word 
 throughout the whole of the near East 
In the as far as Indian culture is concerned I wanted to
tell you one thing that is excuse me that is exactly based
on the the Vedas and the Upanishads
 and uh philosophical concepts of life 
Uh in a well known Rigvedic hymn that is describing the
battle fought by the Indo-Aryan king Surdas with uh the confederacy
of ten kings one word 
Actually they were uh a love people 
Harikrishna Dev he is one of the well known philo 
 philosophers and culturist 
He said he had suggested with great plausibility that the
tribes mentioned in the Rigveda were the same as those mentioned in the
Egyptian documents 
And uh this would suggest that external influences from the
near East was not absent even in the ancient period of India's 
emergence as a characterised cultural unit 
And uhm this person Harikrishna Dev would identify
the farmer with the people known to Egyptians as uhm the Purasati
who were the same as the uh Philistines and Palistines 
And uh that's convincing but nevertheless noteworthy
 in uh these proposals to identify some king mentioned in uh 
Shatpata Brahman 
Now all this all this why I'm mentioning the Sanskrit
names is totally based on the Indian culture 
Indian culture actually these all these names what I'm
 speaking of that is all its each and every brick of our Indian
culture you know it's a dream house 
Now until recently it was generally admitted that Vedic
Sanskrit was the oldest Indo-Aryan language as far as the Indian culture was
concerned 
Uh later finally the Hitite question came before us 
that uh and it is now admitted that the discovery and the reading of
the language of the Hitites has brought forth the history of the
Indo-European and the earl earlier 
visitor 
This would make the ancient Greek language interior to the 
Vedic by atleast a couple of countries 
So by observing all these things we can come to a
conclusion that Indian culture actually it was not brought up on
its own it was brought up through the the influences 
through the the way of thinking of the other cultures 
That means we may come to know that before Indian culture
 there were some more countries who were who have developed
their own cultures and their own systems and their own way of life and
their own uh way of thinking their own way of uh expressing
themselves 
Now we will look at the universal ideals of Indian culture 
Now we should look upon the pilgrims programmes of humanity as
being essentially one in this great question of uh which mankind has
undertaken 
Ever since man became conscious of his intellectual heritage 
India in its own way has made a contri great contribution 
in formulating this contribution of India 
From the very fact that its genesis are the people its
genesis as a people I am specifying here India has had to take note
of the thoughts and ideas and actions and behaviours of so many
different people so many and uh take note of them sympathetic and uh 
what we can say that uh you know uh all embracing spirit that
would be the the better word all embracing spirit
That means it is the spirit which which welcomes all the
cultures and all the concepts all the way of life 
And that is what it has that is what has given the basic tone
or colour to the uh uh culture of India as representing a great
synthesis 
So this synthesis word actually I have already mentioned that
Indian culture it is the synthesis 
And it is philosophical as well as spiritual and mystical
synthesis as well as practical expression of which is the sum
total of the all the philosophy which developed in India with the
great ideals of uh the Vedas and the Upanishads and looming in the
background and uh even forming the basis 
The aspiration and the way of life as proposed by this culture and
 and accepble acceptable to the
entire mankind 
It can be theoritically put in a one word form
 that is uh a few quotations from earlier Indian literature
actually I am taking this uh literature from from one of the
 references 
It says thus That which is is one wise men
speak of it in many ways 
Now this I'm specifying here that which is is
one and wise men speak of it in many ways 
And uh to refrain from all evil to cultivate that
which is good to discipline ones own mind ignore evil cultivate
graciousness develop universal love and do at your good to all 
Now when we observe all these quotations we will get a 
 very very very very clear clear clear 
 cut crystal clear idea that Indian culture it is the
base is very broad very broad and that broadness that uh broad
single base and different buildings have been constructed and the
different religions has have been constructed that
different philosophies have been constructed and different concepts have been
constructed 
Now when we study Indian culture actually we should
look at the geographical influence in the on the development
 and evolution of Indian culture 
Now I will I think that uh in studying the cultural
development of any country not only India I I'll I'll take
it out the general this thing the general country 
In studying the cultural development of any country the
importance of uh its geographical factors okay it can can hardly be
minimised in the early periods of human history geography determine
to a great extent to the that the leads and uh uh activities of the
people as well as their thought and literature 
Now I'll tell you geography shaped history largely than uh
 as it does even today all over the world though in a different manner
Man has been independent on the physical facts of nature but he
has not been content to live under these limitation 
And he has always driven progressively to break through the
barriers placed by the nature 
And uh history of India is uh no exception to this
point 
So this interplay what we call it as interplay of uh the
forces of geography and human will and genius 
Actually it is uh indeed very interesting subject and
Now we'll try to uhm what shall we say
evaluate we'll try to uh enhance the influence of Indian
geography and the culture of its people on the one hand and how the
challenge of geography has also been met on the other 
Now let us come to physical facts 
Now this physical facts uh which have uh directly or
indirectly influenced the history of civilisation of India and it has
been the size of the country and its comparative isolation uh 
afforded by the Himalayas
