Rajamundri east Godavari of Andhra Pradesh  Lok Sabha
""
""
This is her first term as a member of parliament 
""
But 
""
Long before she face the people  life
""
""
Yes 
""
But she is known beyond Andhra as well 
""
Those of us who remember the film 
""
""
But apart from  she
has largely restricted herself 
""
Although she has also acted in Tamil and Kannada films as well 
""
Jamunajee  considering how many films and how films have been
 it must have been smooth sailing for
you isn't it  ?
""
""
Yes of course  uh

""
Because uh as a cinema artist we use to go into the masses  and
uh for shooting  as a social workers also
""
""
We have a lot of contact with uh 
""
So naturally when we have become a  I think
uh 
one or two word  our politician
""
""
When did you actually entered films  ?
""
""
I was so young  I was
just fourteen years 
""
So I entered into the film fray  in the first
picture itself 
""
One  uh
""
""
""
""
""
Uh my first picture was 
Foottillu 
Maike 
""
In nineteen fifty-two  he
introduced me to the film 
""
He hails from 
""
""
So he introduced me to the film 
""
""
We know that you have  played a
leading role 
""
Especially that you have always played a leading actress 
""
How many Hindi films have you made  ?
""
""
So far I have acted uh 
in Hindi

My first Hindi film was uh  Naya Aadmi
""
""
And then  Miss Mary
""
""
Third was 
""
Fourth 
""
Fifth 
 uh
so many films
""
And  recently I
acted with uh 
""
""
Like that so many films I acted 
""
""
Yeah the song that was picturised on you  bol gori bol
tera kaun piya  that was a very famous song
""
""
""
""
That was uh 
""
I received a filmfare award 
 in those
days 
""
I think  the first South Indian star to receive a
filmfare award 
""
""
""
Now that  is
it true that people are now wanting to see more of your old films 
""
""
Yes 
collegues are uh  old films
""
They are asking me  Jamunajee kahan milte hai apke
""
""
How can we get your 
 ?
""
I said I will try to  bring some old films for you
""
I will give it 
""
I was trying to get hold of my old films 
""
 you know that old films are very precious
to get
""
""
Yeah 
""
We also know that you have been active on theatre 
""
Uh  also the president of the Andhra Pradesh
professional theatre group 
""
What are your activities there  ?
""
""
You see as a artist also  I acted more than two hundred
films 
""
We have  unforgetable
roles 
""
Uh even as a  sufferring lady
just like 
""
I did  character in Telugu version
which Nargis did in Hindi version 
""
So 
""
So such 
""
And then 
""
theatre artist 
""
Because cinema is uh  uh
dramas only
""
From dramas only we have become a very famous actors in films you
see 
""
So one should not forget theatre at all 
""
We came from theatre
""
We hail from theatre 
""
We have learnt acting on theatre 
""
So I want to do service to theatre artist  uh
president of AP Professional Artist Theatre Federation 
""
It is uh 
""
 got more than ten
thousand members 
""
And the president for that  while
acting also I was so busy as a artist  uh give lot
of service to the  artist giving
pensions 
""
And uh to improve their art to use to give  a lot of
encouragement 
""
Still I am continuing as a president of Professional Artist Theatre
Federation 
""
""
""
""
Why did you 
yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Naturally after uh  I want to
give full uh 
""
I I don't like to put one leg  in film
field and one leg in politician 
""
I think we can't  performance
""
So I want to give up my film career due to  po
""
""
""
But your family compulsion as well 
""
""
No not much 
""
Because my husband is a very co-operative man 
""
And then  going
my family life also 
""
I have married  Professor
of Zoology 
""
I got 
""
So life is going smoothly 
""
""
They must also be very fond of your old films I am sure
""
""
""
""
""
There is one question about film I wanted to ask you 
""
Do your fans  feel still as the screen image that they have of
you  ?
""
Or do they know that you only act  ?
""
How do they react to you when they see you in person  ?
""
""
Naturally they are uh  very much excited to see as a person
""
Because uh  uh uhm
for example I can say at my Rajmundari constituency I used to go to  to
very rural places 
""
So there  they are worshipping as
a 
""
So after seeing me naturally they  get lot of uh
excitement
""
Some people especially 
""
I have got 
""
So they used to  embrace me and kiss me
""
They said oh Jamunajee  see you
""
""
So we are very happy  and then you
must do good work for those  you should solve our problems
""
I said I had given a promise 
""
So that excitement will be will be there 
""
Not on uh
""
""
Cinema has been contributing 
in the south especially it has been throwing up some very 
uh politicians 
""
Why do you think more and more politicians in the south take to
 ?
""
""
I think as a  citizen has
""
""
Politician means not only a  uhm getting some money or getting
fame 
""
We can do service to the public 
""
As a democratic country we have got  uh every right to every
man and the woman and every citizen of India they got a right to  enter
into the politics there is no restrictions for that 
""
""
But does their screen image really help them  ?
""
""
Sometimes 
that glamour 
""
""
""
""
""
Does it make your canvassing easier  ?
""
""
Not easier 
""
Just like other  canvass because now-a-days
 there
public has uh 
""
Now  there now we can't attract
them with glamour all those things 
""
The glamour will be there  one word
""
""
Otherwise not possible
""
""
In this modern world where we have television we have news
magazines  the role
that he performs is just a role  a simple man like us
""
""
There are still these images that people have 
""
How do they maintain  ?
""
""
The film ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
You see  one
should have certain principles in personal life also 
""
And then he should uh  representing
 rural character
representing poor 
""
Then if uh act uh if he acts like this he can maintain his  uh
good image in film field also long  I
had so many variety characters 
""
""
What kind of screen image did you have  ?
""
""
I had uh  very good image otherwise I think I should not
say myself it shows 
""
Even then I have to say  to public that I am I think I am the
first lady to  as a heroine
 of south Indian screen I can say
""
""
So like that  I got that image in public
""
""
How many of your films have won awards  ?
""
""
Out of two hundreds may be nearly hundred films  state
awards 
""
While national awards  to come to Delhi very
often 
""
And Mrs Gandhi was there  Information and Broadcasting minister
""
""
And then state awards for so many films 
""
""
Which is the highest award  ?
""
""
I think in Hindi film 
""
""
And of course in Andhra Pradesh if we  state awards and best
actress award  continously nine
times I have been elected as a best 
""
""
""
Welcome to the studio and thank you for being with us 
""
First of all when we talk about parallel processing and
super- ?
""
""
Super-computers really  amount of data number it
contains 
""
The good old days about thirty years ago  big two garages will
contain  it control
about ten  of operations
""
Ten 
in  that is super computing
""
""
Why do we need it in India  ?
""
""
We require it for weather modelling  pollution monitering
 variety of things
""
Where ever you need  these things if you
want to look at 
""
Do it 
""
It has a lot of uh  uses in these
""
""
 ko banane mei
kharcha bahut hota hai Rajan saheb 
""
Is this expenditure justified  ?
""
""
 Jyada nahi haan
""
Yeh jo sidhaant mei jo  hoti hai uski
 usse
 agriculture model
 seismic
modelling  safety
""
""
""
So 
""
Iske upar bahut sare uh  se
karne hai  mei hona
chahiye 
""
Abhi kuch das saal ke  Jee saheb ke liye bahut sare
""
karenge  ko itni
tarakki jo 
the computer parallel process 
""
""
""
""
""
We we don't want him to be replaced by
""
""
Oh no no no not remove him  not him
""
""
""
""
""
""
karenge  aur thoda haan tum karo abhi
yeh Tamil mei baat karo nahi to doosre mei baat karo
""
Woh kar sakte hain
""
Woh to  future generation
""
""
""
""
""
And you know since we 
and I are a bit ignorant about 
""
 parallel processing would you like to explain
in in simple 
""
""
""
""
The computer for past thirty years has been doing  do one uh
competition  do one competition put it in a memory
""
It does it very fast but 
""
When we are thinking in terms of tons and 
 that is hundred million two hundred million five hundred million type of
operations  this slows down the process
""
So  many
brains using in harmony 
""
So actually some computer people say  tyranny of the central
memory will be gone 
""
Many many places 
""
So you can handle large amount of data
""
That is parallel processing 
""
It is essential  advance super computer in later stage
""
""
""
Mr Rajan  closely involved in monitoring the
development of uh this technology in India
""
How far away  ?
""
""
Not very far 
""
These works which are taking place in C dot  then
there are the number of parallel processing of course in N A L  Indian
Institute of Science  C M C L they are all doing very
well 
""
I would not like to see in terms of number of years of first and
second two or three 
""
But in terms of one  using the software for various uses
weather forcasting modelling etcetera 
""
As well as for these 
""
They are quite  to the needs of our
country we should be able to meet most of it in the coming years
""
""
How  India's
 technology in this field compare to other countries ?
""
""
Contemporary  in fact this
technology is itself only four five years or seven eight years old 
""
So we are very close to  those things
""
Some of 
""
""
And once  how will you
 ?
""
""
Oh there are number of possibilities say my job is technology
forecasting 
""
There are so many things which can be done whether it is pollution
monitering even heart stimulation 
""
Do anything which you want to look at  before designing a car
""
""
Do the design there 
""
So you can  build a dam you want to look at
safety  without spending any
money 
""
Then you look at it 
""
Many of these things  uh using
it in that form 
""
There are many hundreds of young men and women in the country 
who will use it 
""
""
Mr Rajan one last question 
""
Gaze into your crystal bowl  after the super computer in India
 ?
""
""
Artificial 
""
""
 he can
have hundreds of them 
""
How many other  right
""
""
 obviously excited about the developments
taking place 
""
""
Thank you 
""
""
And we certainly have shared the excitement  Jee saheb
jinhone bataya
