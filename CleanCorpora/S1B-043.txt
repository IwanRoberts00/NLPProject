<I>
Mrs Jamuna is a Congress-I member of Parliament representing
Rajamundri east Godavari of Andhra Pradesh in the Lok Sabha
 
This is her first term as a member of parliament 
But her talent is multifaceted 
Long before she face the people she was facing life
 studio life 
Yes she is a famous film personality of Andhra 
But she is known beyond Andhra as well 
Those of us who remember the film Milan 
 cannot forget her award winning performance as Gauri 
But apart from occasional stories into the Hindi cinema she
has largely restricted herself to Telugu cinema 
Although she has also acted in Tamil and Kannada films as well 
Jamunajee considering how many films and how films have been
 making politicians in the south it must have been smooth sailing for
you isn't it ?
Yes of course because uh being a cine artist uh
we use to are more accustomed to public 
Because uh as a cinema artist we use to go into the masses and
uh for shooting and for for public meeting as a social workers also
We have a lot of contact with uh public in cine life 
So naturally when we have become a uh politician I think
uh it's not much difficult to uh do our service as 
one or two word our politician
When did you actually entered films ?
I was so young I think uh nineteen fifty-two I was
just fourteen years may be 
So I entered into the film fray as a heroine in the first
picture itself 
One one word uh
 One word I'm sorry 
Uh my first picture was the name 
Foottillu that means in Hindi you can say 
Maike 
In nineteen fifty-two one Mr uh late Raja Rao he
introduced me to the film 
He hails from uh Rajamundri constituency which I'm 
 now presenting as a public servant 
So he introduced me to the film as a heroine first 
We know that you have for thirty years played a
leading role in cinema 
Especially that you have always played a leading actress 
How many Hindi films have you made ?
So far I have acted uh nearly twenty twenty films 
in Hindi 
My first Hindi film was uh Naya Aadmi
 and that was superhit film in those days 
And then second picture Miss Mary
 
Third was uh Humrahi 
Fourth Milan 
Fifth Rishte-nate Beti-bete 
 and then Dulhan uh
so many films
And Rajtilak recently I
acted with uh Sanjeev Kumar in Yadgar 
 and uh Naukar Bibi ka 
Like that so many films I acted 
Yeah the song that was picturised on you bol gori bol
tera kaun piya that was a very famous song
 Laughs Yes of course 
That was uh Milan picture 
I received a filmfare award from for 
 Milan best actress award in those
days 
I think I'm the first South Indian star to receive a
filmfare award as a best actress in Milan 
 
Now that you've become a member of parliament is
it true that people are now wanting to see more of your old films 
Yes especially uh become MP all our MP's 
collegues are uh very much interested to see my films old films
They are asking me uh Jamunajee kahan milte hai apke
 films apto bahot purani kalakar hai 
How can we get your Hamarahi Milan 
 ?
I said I will try to bring some old films for you
I will give it as a presentation to everybody 
I was trying to get hold of my old films 
 One or two words you know that old films are very precious
to get
Yeah 
We also know that you have been active on theatre front 
Uh you're also the president of the Andhra Pradesh
professional theatre group 
What are your activities there ?
You see as a artist also I acted more than two hundred
films 
We have acted such a wonderful characters unforgetable
roles 
Uh even as a old lady uh and then uh sufferring lady
just like Mother India 
I did Mother India character in Telugu version
which Nargis did in Hindi version 
So it's a very beautiful motherly character 
So such a types of characters I acted 
And then after that I thought of to 
 do some uh work for uplift of these old indigent 
theatre artist 
Because cinema is uh fundamentally we should act in uh
dramas only
From dramas only we have become a very famous actors in films you
see 
So one should not forget theatre at all 
We came from theatre
We hail from theatre 
We have learnt acting on theatre 
So I want to do service to theatre artist I become a uh
president of AP Professional Artist Theatre Federation 
It is uh uhm state level body 
 I have we have got more than ten
thousand members all over the state Andhra Pradesh 
And the president for that for the last fifteen years while
acting also I was so busy as a artist even then I used to uh give lot
of service to the especially this old indigent artist giving
pensions and then getting house one word for them 
And uh to improve their art to use to give a lot of
encouragement 
Still I am continuing as a president of Professional Artist Theatre
Federation 
 I'm returning to the subject of films 
Why did you discontinued uh your film career 
yeah 
 Film career 
 Laughs 
Naturally after uh becoming a politician I want to
give full uh justice to my uh profession 
I I don't like to put one leg this side one leg in film
field and one leg in politician as a politician 
I think we can't do any justice to our performance
So I want to give up my film career due to uh po
 politics 
But your family compulsion as well 
No not much 
Because my husband is a very co-operative man 
And then sm smoothly going
my family life also 
I have married to my uh my husband is a Professor
of Zoology at Osmania University 
I got uh one son and daughter 
So life is going smoothly 
They must also be very fond of your old films I am sure
 Laughs 
There is one question about film I wanted to ask you 
Do your fans feel still as the screen image that they have of
you ?
Or do they know that you only act perform roles ?
How do they react to you when they see you in person ?
Naturally they are uh very much excited to see as a person
Because uh being a veteran artist for thirty years uh uhm
for example I can say at my Rajmundari constituency I used to go to to
very rural places 
So there they were just like uh they are worshipping as
a goddess 
So after seeing me naturally they will get lot of uh
excitement
Some people especially uh lady character 
I have got lady fans more than uh gents I think so 
So they used to embrace me and kiss me
They said oh Jamunajee we never thought we'll see you
 uh like this 
So we are very happy we'll vote for you and then you
must do good work for those our uh you should solve our problems
I said I had given a promise 
So that excitement will be will be there 
Not on uh
Cinema has been contributing uh to very large extent 
in the south especially it has been throwing up some very interesting 
uh politicians 
Why do you think more and more politicians in the south take to
 uh sorry more and more film personalities in south take to politics ?
I think as a citizen of India every citizen has
 a right to become a politician 
Politician means not only a uhm getting some money or getting
fame 
We can do service to the public 
As a democratic country we have got uh every right to every
man and the woman and every citizen of India they got a right to enter
into the politics there is no restrictions for that 
But does their screen image really help them ?
Sometimes in this that is image is there 
that glamour will add our political 
 In this 
Does it make your canvassing easier ?
Not easier 
Just like other a few words canvass because now-a-days
 uh uh political situation and especially rural masses also there
public has uh got uh political awareness 
Now they are not uh so easily there now we can't attract
them with glamour all those things 
The glamour will be there but one should not work one word
 very hardly then only we will win 
Otherwise not possible
In this modern world where we have television we have news
magazines where they keep telling us that an actor the role
that he performs is just a role he is in fact a simple man like us
There are still these images that people have 
How do they maintain how does a man maintain his image ?
The film ?
Yes 
You see the film uh maintaining the image one
should have certain principles in personal life also 
And then he should uh take good characters representing
 some social problems economic problems with a rural character
representing poor family's character 
Then if uh act uh if he acts like this he can maintain his uh
good image in film field also long long standing image like me I
had so many variety characters 
What kind of screen image did you have ?
I had uh very good image otherwise I think I should not
say myself it shows uh little bit embarassment 
Even then I have to say to public that I am I think I am the
first lady to act in two hundred not two hundred films as a heroine
 thirty years as a leading lady of south Indian screen I can say
So like that I got that image in public
How many of your films have won awards ?
Out of two hundreds may be nearly hundred films state
awards and then national awards 
While national awards one word to come to Delhi very
often 
And Mrs Gandhi was there Information and Broadcasting minister
 a few words 
And then state awards for so many films 
Which is the highest award that you have got ?
I think in Hindi film Milan 
 is uh highest filmfare filmfare award is there for me 
And of course in Andhra Pradesh if we state awards and best
actress award in Telugu films I am the first lady continously nine
times I have been elected as a best actress award 
Welcome to the studio and thank you for being with us 
First of all when we talk about parallel processing and
super-computers what are these things ?
Super-computers really the amount of data number it
contains 
The good old days about thirty years ago big two garages will
contain things with small capability now it comes it control
about ten crore of operations
Ten crores the hundred mega flops you see 
in one second that's type of that is super computing
Why do we need it in India ?
We require it for weather modelling pollution monitering
 variety of things
Where ever you need too fast too big these things if you
want to look at you have to now crunch the numbers very fast 
Do it and then see what it means 
It has a lot of uh uses in these
 Lekin super computer ko banane mei
kharcha bahut hota hai Rajan saheb 
Is this expenditure justified ?
 Jyada nahi haan
Yeh jo sidhaant mei jo development hoti hai uski
 thirty-six crore ki cheez hai aur uska jo usse
 benefit jo hota hai ke agriculture model
 ho water modelling ho seismic
modelling ho aur reactor ki safety
 ho dam ki safety ho 
So itne hain ke woh fed-up ho jayega 
Iske upar bahut sare uh computer software se
karne hai woh itne hojayenge ke pura society mei hona
chahiye 
Abhi kuch das saal ke uh agle Jee saheb ke liye bahut sare
 robot bhi ho sakte hain jo translate 
karenge laughter hopefully so knowledge ko itni
tarakki jo data process karne uhm 
the computer parallel process ki bauchhar hogi 
 Uhm 
We we don't want him to be replaced by
Oh no no no not remove him not him
 Jee saheb has to 
 Jee saheb to bahut sare ka use 
karenge accha aur thoda haan tum karo abhi
yeh Tamil mei baat karo nahi to doosre mei baat karo
Woh kar sakte hain
Woh to future generation
 Accha 
And you know since we you know Jee saheb 
and I are a bit ignorant about technical terms 
 Yeh parallel processing would you like to explain
in in simple uh terms 
 Okay 
The computer for past thirty years has been doing do one uh
competition put it in a memory do one competition put it in a memory
It does it very fast but that has a limit 
When we are thinking in terms of tons and crore 
 that is hundred million two hundred million five hundred million type of
operations per second then this slows down the process
So you do it in a different multiple persons many
brains using in harmony 
So actually some computer people say tyranny of the central
memory will be gone 
Many many places they all do it in parallel 
So you can handle large amount of data
That is parallel processing 
It is essential to advance super computer in later stage
Mr Rajan you're closely involved in monitoring the
development of uh this technology in India
How far away is India from its own super computer ?
Not very far 
These works which are taking place in C dot C tac then
there are the number of parallel processing of course in N A L Indian
Institute of Science D R D O BARC C M C L they are all doing very
well 
I would not like to see in terms of number of years of first and
second two or three 
But in terms of one using the software for various uses
weather forcasting modelling etcetera 
As well as for these 
They are quite in contemporary to the needs of our
country we should be able to meet most of it in the coming years
How far developed how developed is India's
 technology in this field compare to other countries ?
Contemporary I would say not more than in fact this
technology is itself only four five years or seven eight years old 
So we are very close to those things
Some of it's developments 
And once we've the super computers how will you
 Mr Rajan use it ?
Oh there are number of possibilities say my job is technology
forecasting 
There are so many things which can be done whether it is pollution
monitering even heart stimulation 
Do anything which you want to look at before designing a car
 before designing an aircraft you want to see 
Do the design there let it crash and see 
So you can one word build a dam you want to look at
safety anything can be done in the computer without spending any
money 
Then you look at it then you perfect the design 
Many of these things though I myself would not be uh using
it in that form 
There are many hundreds of young men and women in the country 
who will use it and then they will export even the software 
Mr Rajan one last question 
Gaze into your crystal bowl after the super computer in India
 what next ?
Artificial inte intelligence 
 fifth generation computer 
 That's what I meant Jee saheb he can
have hundreds of them 
How many other that's right
 You're obviously excited about the developments
taking place 
Thank you 
And we certainly have shared the excitement Jee saheb
jinhone bataya super computer ke bare mein 
 Haan Deepakji bas mei itna chahata hoon ke 
science technology super computer ka labh hum tak hum aam
logon tak chhoti tabiyat ke logon tak jald se jald pahoonch jaye
 Yehi Rajan saheb aap ko bata rahe the 
Our guest this morning was Mr Y S Rajan adviser in Department
of Science and Technology 
 We've been talking to him about the exciting break
through in the field of parallel processing and super computer development in
India
