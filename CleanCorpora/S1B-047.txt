""
""
""
A legend in his lifetime  known as the greatest gentleman tennis
player of the world
""
Certainly  greatest tennis player ever
""
And right now he is with us in our studios Mr Ramanathan Krishnan
""
""
Mr Krishnan  welcome to our studios and thank you very much for
 being with us
""
""
Thank you Deepak 
""
""
Uh we would like to take you down memory lanes  yeah
 we would like to travel into the past
""
""
""
""
""
Tell us about how you  got involved in tennis ?
""
""
Yes 
""
It all 
""
And he used to be a good player  in his playing days that was
before the war time 
""
And he used them 
""
He was the best player in the south and  he was one of the top
ranking Indian player 
""
So he 
""
And then  into
""
""
""
Who coached you in your earliest days  ?
""
""
My father has been my main 
""
Uh he started coaching me when I was about 
""
That  people used
to consider quite younger that time
""
But today 
""
I started when I was about ten years old 
""
And uh  some
rigorous programmes for me
""
Lot of training and lot of practice sessions and uh  it was hard
work 
""
""
Uhm now the emphasis appears to be on physical fitness as much
as on 
""
And at the time when you were being coached  ?
""
""
Well Deepak it has been the same 
""
I mean if you take tennis for last forty fifty years 
""
And in fact people ask me  How do you compare a champion
of a  ?
""
You know  you know I talked
to people and uh  of todays
""
I think that one common factor 
""
They all had to be 
 who can play this game
well 
""
""
What kind of equipment and facilities did you have when you
started playing tennis  ?
""
""
Well uh 
""
Facilities are much more today 
""
But in my playing days for instance we used to play with wooden
rackets 
""
Now you see 
there're 
""
""
you're 
""
The pace is an advantage for the modern players
""
We didn't had that 
""
But then  take
Rod Laver
""
Uh I mean he played with the wooden rackets
""
And  Lu Hoad or Jack Kramer they hit the ball as hard because
""
""
So  a question of I mean I do agree that the
equipment is better 
""
But you know once you  you know as an athlete who is very
talented 
broomstick he can play tennis well 
""
""
Was it possible to  I'm
 question to you
""
Was it possible to do that ?
""
""
""
""
""
Very interesting question
""
Very good question 
""
And it used to be amateur sports those days 
""
Like I was an amateur player
""
And 
all amateurs 
""
Then they turn professional later on 
""
And uh 
""
In fact those days unfortunately they used to look down  on the
professionals you know
""
So they were very few in number 
""
They used to be under group under Jack Kramer 
""
And uh  in nineteen sixty things have changed
""
And the status of the game has changed now 
""
Now 
""
A full time job and uh  lucrative
""
""
""
Mr Krishnan there is one question that is lot of people have
always wanted to ask you 
""
Forgive me for this question but 
 all of a sudden Ramanathan Krishnan just sort of went away
""
Hang out his racket and he went away 
""
Uh  get interested in coaching you didn't
want to take an active part in  the management of tennis in this country
""
""
""
""
""
Well uh  I didn't hang up my racket quickly
""
I mean I had a pretty long innings 
""
I mean I played for quiet a long time you know I had a long innings
you know
""
""
""
""
""
I played nearly  twenty-five to thirty
years 
""
""
""
""
""
In fact I had three 
""
First I was playing you know  my best playing days is in the
fifties and the sixties 
""
Then I quit for sometime 
""
And uh when Ramesh started improving his tennis 
it's  you know
practice with him which would help him which it did 
""
So I came back in the  seventy-four or
seventy-five around that time
""
And Ramesh was coming up 
""
Then Ramesh was on his own feet  improved and went you know went
the circuit
""
I quit again 
""
And finally in the early eighties  they
introduced a new event called the grand masters  ex-tennis
players 
""
You know 
""
But  compete in regular competition
""
They call it a grand masters events 
""
It was the assembly of 
""
So I was invited to take part in that  in the main in United
States and a few tournaments in Europe 
""
So I competed again  Rod Laver
Kanross Wall all big legendary names you know 
""
I enjoyed it  also
finished now because 
""
New forty-fives are now coming in 
""
You know when I was forty-five
""
 played for nearly nine ten years
""
""
And I 
""
And now the new forty-fives you know  for event like that you
always need some new blood 
""
So the new forty-fives are now coming you know the reason 
""
""
""
""
""
They are already professionals in the rally
""
 but the new
persons are coming in
""
So that event is going on now
""
""
""
""
""
Well this this  senior collegue of mine here is nine
hundred and ninety-five years old and he is going to  learn tennis
 in a little while
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
But there is the question that  that I I want to repeat it
again Mr Krishnan 
""
Why has uh  Mr Krishnan never been available for coaching ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah you asked me that question 
""
You see  the lesson
important like I played the grand masters for eight nine years 
""
Then in between I was  travelling with Ramesh trying to help
him for a few years
""
When he need 
""
And I firmly believe 
it's 
""
This coaching everything is not a quick process you know it takes
years 
""
If I take up  I've
 to live with them be with them right through
""
And I couldn't do anything else 
""
And 
""
I couldn't afford the time
""
And I didn't want to you know  take up
something half-heartedly and leave it in the middle 
""
So this is one of the main reason 
""
And uh  good coaches who teach
the fundamentals of the game alright 
""
Where  when they improve the
tennis 
""
""
We here  that's
""
""
Is there any truth in this ?
""
""
Well uh  in the capital for two reasons
""
""
One is to watch the Davis Cup match  going on
between  India and Korea
""
Which is at a very interesting stage
""
""
In which  brilliantly
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh 
""
I met again dynamic man called Bobby Singh 
""
Who is uh in organising a tennis academy 
""
Uh tennis for tennis academy
""
I believe  in
this area 
""
And uh object is to 
""
And then give them all the opportunities and uh  you know give
them the coaching and training facilities 
""
So that  take a group of some thirty forty boys
and girls 
""
So that out of the  a few good quality player may
be three or four will come out in three years time
""
""
""
So he asked me when I was here last month passing through Delhi
""
""
He Asked me whether I could help them or give them a little 
few few tips and all 
""
So I thought 
I've  lot of things out of
this game 
""
So I said why not give that to game 
""
So  right after the Davis Cup
match 
going to be working with this uh  young children
""
""
Oh wonderful 
""
 de
rahen hain naujawan bacchon ko
""
Ek hafta das din ke liye desh ki rajdhani mei rahenge aur yahan
par ek 
""
Agar aap chahen to 
mai de sakta hoon 
""
""
 mere pas itni
fursat nahin  dekhta
hoon 
""
""
""
""
""
 Usi liye itna wakht lag jata hai aur ab khelne ke
liye  agar panch hazar saal purani haddiyan hain to
""
""
""
""
""
""
 sorry I said he was nine hundred and something
he says  five thousand years old
""
""
 one word
 you know
""
""
Which is very young  five
thousand very young 
""
""
""
""
""
Mr Krishnan what do you consider  which match do you
consider your greatest match ever  ?
""
""
Well as stated earlier I had a long inning
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So  you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think uh  all the listeners
would expect me to say this 
""
The match against Thomas Coss which I played  inter-zonal
final against 
""
That is very important  because I was playing the fifth match
""
It was two match for I was playing the fifth match  and of
course  a marathon match
a deciding match which I happen to win 
""
 very important because that took the country to
the 
""
The challenge for the Davis Cup was there for the first time 
""
You know first time is always very important 
""
And I always take pride in that that I broke that ice 
""
And you know  got to the finals
""
It was a thrilling moments for other players Thomas Coss 
""
And uh 
nearly  twenty-five years ago
""
""
""
""
Yeah  going to mention one or two other
matches that
""
""
This is the main one because you know  a Davis
Cup match 
""
Another one is uh  my matches against
Roy Emerson the quarter final at Wimbledon
""
We played on the central court 
""
I was seeded number seven
""
He was number four 
""
He was a favourite 
""
I played exceptionally well on that day and  I managed to be
in great state  uh which took me to the semi-final of Wimbledon for the
second time 
""
That was a very important match uh  quality wise
""
I played good tennis 
""
And another one which I always remember is  as against Rod
Laver in the opening round the opening match of the  Davis Cup competition
inter-zone finals between India and Australia 
""
We played the match in the United States 
""
You know those days the rules of the games
""
The rules of the Davis Cup competition were such that  you know
the nation that was holding the Cup
""
You know today  not like that
""
Today everybody plays no ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
But those days  the nation which was holding the cup the
holders  they played only one match
""
They played winners of the 
""
So on that that year  I mean United States was holding the Cup
""
""
Which meant we had to play the earlier matches like the inter-zone
finals 
""
""
""
""
""
I played that match in Boston and beat Laver
""
I mean I must confess that Rod Laver was that great
""
He played afterwards with everybody 
""
But even then 
that gave me lot of pressure breathing in because I realise how talented he
was and uh 
""
I always remember that match 
""
""
When you reached  the semi-finals of the Wimbledon for the
first time 
 ?
""
And after you played it what did you do ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 tell you something
""
Looking back  well I know certain things which I shouldn't have
done
""
""
""
Thats what  you know
 you make some mistakes
""
I did make a mistake 
""
Somewhere on I was over awed at that occasion 
""
But I got in the semi-finals at Wimbledon
""
I was over awed 
""
You know  only two matches to win to win the title I
was very close to it 
""
And the people who  I had beaten them here
and there 
""
You know  but
uh  one occasion I lost to Neil Fraser neat serve uh another
occasion  Rod Laver
""
Second level Rod Laver in sixty-one 
""
And you know  I've
""
""
But on that occasion I was over awed  two
of the best out pass two of the left that left handed again its known 
""
It so happened I had to play them on fast grass court
""
This I wouldn't play well and uh  they were the better players
""
But I think if uh  I should have been little more you know it
is  I
played normally
""
I should have done something extra bit you know
""
On an occasion like that  you can't afford to play just normal
tennis and get away
""
 to do something extra
""
Which I didn't do 
""
""
 Deepekji hamesha ki tarah aap meri baat mehmen tak
pahuncha dijiye 
""
Dekhye  jo Bharat
ke puri abadi ke pratinidhi hai mai un sab ki taraf se mehman ka shukriya ada
karta hoon 
""
Mehman ni Bhartiya  ke liye jo kuch kiya
hai

Meri aur  ke doston ki ek chhoti si
khwaish hai 
ya unki sifarish se puri ho jaye

Wimbledon 
""
""
What  ?
""
Do you wish to respond to what he has said  ?
""
""
Uh I understood him 
""
Well as far as 
""
""
If we produce you know 
if we get two or three or four good players  and good tennis
stadium 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That would be nice because you know 
worked very hard in this game 
""
I would like somebody to keep up this game and  you know keep
the flag flying  my
ambition 
""
""
Uh Mr Krishnan coming back to your reputation as a gentleman
tennis player
""
Now you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to
but 
that if there was ever a line called  which the empire awarded in your
favour 
then the next point you would deliberately return the ball into the net 
""
Is that true ?
""
That you would  you would you know equalise
""
""
""
""
""
Well I will tell you the truth now
""
I can afford to tell you the truth now 
I've
