""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 one word
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
consider your greatest match ever  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The match against Thomas Coss which I played  inter-zonal
""
""
""
""
It was two match for I was playing the fifth match  and of
course  a marathon match
""
""
 very important because that took the country to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  going to mention one or two other
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We played on the central court 
""
""
""
""
""
He was a favourite 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And another one which I always remember is  as against Rod
""
inter-zone finals between India and Australia 
""
""
""
You know those days the rules of the games
""
The rules of the Davis Cup competition were such that  you know
the nation that was holding the Cup
""
""
""
Today everybody plays no ?
""
""
""
""
""
But those days  the nation which was holding the cup the
holders  they played only one match
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I mean I must confess that Rod Laver was that great
""
""
""
""
""
was and uh 
""
I always remember that match 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 you make some mistakes
""
I did make a mistake 
""
""
""
""
""
I was over awed 
""
""
""
""
And the people who  I had beaten them here
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This I wouldn't play well and uh  they were the better players
""
""
is  I
""
""
I should have done something extra bit you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
Which I didn't do 
""
""
 Deepekji hamesha ki tarah aap meri baat mehmen tak
""
""
Dekhye  jo Bharat
""
""
""
""
""
""
Meri aur  ke doston ki ek chhoti si
""
ya unki sifarish se puri ho jaye 
""
""
 to hamari woh hasrat puri ho
jaye 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well as far as 
""
""
""
if we get two or three or four good players  and good tennis
stadium 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That would be nice because you know 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
tennis player
""
Now you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to
""
""
favour 
then the next point you would deliberately return the ball into the net 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I can afford to tell you the truth now
