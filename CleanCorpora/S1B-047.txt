<I>
 Recording broken 
A legend in his lifetime known as the greatest gentleman tennis
player of the world
Certainly India's greatest tennis player ever
And right now he is with us in our studios Mr Ramanathan Krishnan
Mr Krishnan welcome to our studios and thank you very much for
 being with us
Thank you Deepak 
Uh we would like to take you down memory lanes yeah
 we would like to travel into the past
 Yeah 
Tell us about how you got involved in tennis ?
Yes uhm see I come from a tennis playing family 
It all my father started the whole thing 
And he used to be a good player in his playing days that was
before the war time 
And he used them 
He was the best player in the south and he was one of the top
ranking Indian player 
So he he put me into tennis 
And then infact he put Ramesh also to into
 tennis 
Who coached you in your earliest days ?
My father has been my main my main coach 
Uh he started coaching me when I was about ten years old 
That was used to be you know that you people used
to consider quite younger that time
But today they start as early as five or six know 
I started when I was about ten years old 
And uh my father went to for some
rigorous programmes for me
Lot of training and lot of practice sessions and uh it was hard
work 
Uhm now the emphasis appears to be on physical fitness as much
as on proficiency in the game 
And at the time when you were being coached ?
Well Deepak it has been the same 
I mean if you take tennis for last forty fifty years 
And in fact people ask me How do you compare a champion
of a nineteen twenties or thirties ?
You know I've not seen them but you know I talked
to people and uh champions of todays
I think that one common factor that is physical fitness 
They all had to be phy physically 
 very fit and uh it is only athletes who can play this game
well 
What kind of equipment and facilities did you have when you
started playing tennis ?
Well uh you can't compare it with todays 
Facilities are much more today 
But in my playing days for instance we used to play with wooden
rackets 
Now you see no rackets of graphite and aluminium and uh 
there're so many varieties of rackets now 
 It's an improvement because with uh less effort 
you're able to get more pace 
The pace is an advantage for the modern players
We didn't had that 
But then we're good players of the time like take
Rod Laver
Uh I mean he played with the wooden rackets
And Lu Hoad or Jack Kramer they hit the ball as hard because
 they had a very good timing 
So it's a question of I mean I do agree that the
equipment is better 
But you know once you you know as an athlete who is very
talented I mean you you give my him 
broomstick he can play tennis well 
Was it possible to make a living out of tennis I'm
 sorry to put such a material no no question to you
Was it possible to do that ?
 No no 
Very interesting question
Very good question 
And it used to be amateur sports those days 
Like I was an amateur player
And Rod Laver in his earlier days and Lu Hoad they're 
all amateurs 
Then they turn professional later on 
And uh it was a mainly an amateur sports 
In fact those days unfortunately they used to look down on the
professionals you know
So they were very few in number 
They used to be under group under Jack Kramer 
And uh in nineteen sixty things have changed
And the status of the game has changed now 
Now it's a professional sport 
A full time job and uh luc lucrative
 career for the top players 
Mr Krishnan there is one question that is lot of people have
always wanted to ask you 
Forgive me for this question but having reached the peak 
 yeah all of a sudden Ramanathan Krishnan just sort of went away
Hang out his racket and he went away 
Uh you you didn't get interested in coaching you didn't
want to take an active part in the management of tennis in this country
 Yeah 
Well uh I didn't hang up my racket quickly
I mean I had a pretty long innings 
I mean I played for quiet a long time you know I had a long innings
you know
 Laughs 
I played nearly yeah twenty-five to thirty
years 
 Yeah 
In fact I had three life's in tennis 
First I was playing you know my best playing days is in the
fifties and the sixties 
Then I quit for sometime 
And uh when Ramesh started improving his tennis I thought 
it's a good idea to you know compete with him and uh you know
practice with him which would help him which it did 
So I came back in the seventies seventy-four or
seventy-five around that time
And Ramesh was coming up 
Then Ramesh was on his own feet improved and went you know went
the circuit
I quit again 
And finally in the early eighties around eighty-two they
introduced a new event called the grand masters meant for ex-tennis
players 
You know who've done well in the earlier years 
But they're too old to compete in regular competition
They call it a grand masters events 
It was the assembly of ex-champions ex-tennis players 
So I was invited to take part in that in the main in United
States and a few tournaments in Europe 
So I competed again again against people like Rod Laver
Kanross Wall all big legendary names you know 
I enjoyed it and uh it was lot of fun and that's also
finished now because you know the reason 
New forty-fives are now coming in laughter 
You know when I was forty-five
 I'm fifty-four now played for nearly nine ten years
And I we had lot of fun and we had good competition 
And now the new forty-fives you know for event like that you
always need some new blood ah 
So the new forty-fives are now coming you know the reason 
 Ah 
They are already professionals in the rally
 We're not professional yes but the new
persons are coming in
So that event is going on now
 Yes 
Well this this senior collegue of mine here is nine
hundred and ninety-five years old and he is going to learn tennis
 in a little while
 Ah ha 
Ah ha
But there is the question that that I I want to repeat it
again Mr Krishnan yeah 
Why has uh Mr Krishnan never been available for coaching ?
 Yeah 
Yeah you asked me that question 
You see as I said that I kept playing uh the lesson
important like I played the grand masters for eight nine years 
Then in between I was travelling with Ramesh trying to help
him for a few years
When he need when he needed it 
And I firmly believe that in this game you know 
it's uh it's a long process 
This coaching everything is not a quick process you know it takes
years 
If I take up two or three boys or four boys and I've
 to live with them be with them right through
And I couldn't do anything else 
And it's a long process 
I couldn't afford the time
And I didn't want to you know takes stuck take up
something half-heartedly and leave it in the middle 
So this is one of the main reason 
And uh in this country we've good coaches who teach
the fundamentals of the game alright 
Where we're lagging behind is when they improve the
tennis they're a bit directionless 
We here a little dicky bird a little rumour that's
 Ramanathan Krishnan is now going to go in for coaching 
Is there any truth in this ?
Well uh yes I'm in the capital for two reasons
One is to watch the Davis Cup match that's going on
between India and Korea
Which is at a very interesting stage
In which in which your son played brilliantly
 My son played very well 
 He's been good yesterday 
And uh I'm here also for another important reason 
I met again dynamic man called Bobby Singh 
Who is uh in organising a tennis academy 
Uh tennis for tennis academy
I believe he's going to have it in the capital in
this area 
And uh object is to unearth talents tennis talents 
And then give them all the opportunities and uh you know give
them the coaching and training facilities 
So that you know take a group of some thirty forty boys
and girls 
So that out of the quantity a few good quality player may
be three or four will come out in three years time
 It's a very good idea 
So he asked me when I was here last month passing through Delhi
He Asked me whether I could help them or give them a little 
few few tips and all 
So I thought it's a good idea and uh you know 
I've did away lot pressure out of game lot of things out of
this game 
So I said why not give that to game in some small way 
So I said I agreed and uh right after the Davis Cup
match I think around the nineth or tenth or a week I'm 
going to be working with this uh young children
Oh wonderful 
 Jee saheb ab Krishnan saheb training de
rahen hain naujawan bacchon ko
Ek hafta das din ke liye desh ki rajdhani mei rahenge aur yahan
par ek tennis coaching camp lag raha hai 
Agar aap chahen to aap ke liye recommendation 
mai de sakta hoon 
 Deepakji pehli baat to yeh hai ke mere pas itni
fursat nahin ah mai dekhye mai match dekhta
hoon aur mujhe maza ajata hai aur mai gum hojata hoon 
 Ah 
 Usi liye itna wakht lag jata hai aur ab khelne ke
liye after all agar panch hazar saal purani haddiyan hain to
 kahin satak hi na jayen 
 Laughs 
 I'm sorry I said he was nine hundred and something
he says he's five thousand years old
 You'll have to be very young to one word
 this game and play this game you know
Which is very young laughs he's five
thousand very young 
 Laughs 
Mr Krishnan what do you consider which match do you
consider your greatest match ever ?
Well as stated earlier I had a long inning
Yeah
So I had to mention two or three of them you know
 Alright 
I think uh I would always I mean all the listeners
would expect me to say this laughter 
The match against Thomas Coss which I played inter-zonal
final against Brazilian Davis Cup competition nineteen sixty-six 
That is very important because I was playing the fifth match
It was two match for I was playing the fifth match and of
course out on grass court which tend out to be a a marathon match
a deciding match which I happen to win 
 That's very important because that took the country to
the final position they used to call it a challenge you know 
The challenge for the Davis Cup was there for the first time 
You know first time is always very important 
And I always take pride in that that I broke that ice 
And you know we've got to the finals
It was a thrilling moments for other players Thomas Coss 
And uh well uh that's about thirty years ago 
nearly laughter twenty-five years ago
 Laughs 
Yeah then you're going to mention one or two other
matches that
This is the main one because you know it's a Davis
Cup match 
Another one is uh I always remembered my matches against
Roy Emerson the quarter final at Wimbledon
We played on the central court 
I was seeded number seven
He was number four 
He was a favourite 
I played exceptionally well on that day and I managed to be
in great state uh which took me to the semi-final of Wimbledon for the
second time 
That was a very important match uh quality wise
I played good tennis 
And another one which I always remember is as against Rod
Laver in the opening round the opening match of the Davis Cup competition
inter-zone finals between India and Australia 
We played the match in the United States 
You know those days the rules of the games
The rules of the Davis Cup competition were such that you know
the nation that was holding the Cup
You know today it's not like that
Today everybody plays no ?
Yeah
But those days the nation which was holding the cup the
holders they played only one match
They played winners of the rest of the world 
So on that that year I mean United States was holding the Cup
Which meant we had to play the earlier matches like the inter-zone
finals yeah in the United States 
 Yeah 
I played that match in Boston and beat Laver
I mean I must confess that Rod Laver was that great
He played afterwards with everybody 
But even then he was the Wimbledon finalist and uh 
that gave me lot of pressure breathing in because I realise how talented he
was and uh I won in four serve 
I always remember that match 
When you reached the semi-finals of the Wimbledon for the
first time yeah before went to play that match 
 yeah what did you do ?
And after you played it what did you do ?
 You knew that you've beaten 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Ah yeah I'll tell you something
Looking back well I know certain things which I shouldn't have
done
 It's too late 
Thats what happened in happens you know
 in all walks of life you make some mistakes
I did make a mistake 
Somewhere on I was over awed at that occasion 
But I got in the semi-finals at Wimbledon
I was over awed 
You know it's only two matches to win to win the title I
was very close to it 
And the people who I'm playing I had beaten them here
and there 
You know it's not that they had always beaten me but
uh I've one occasion I lost to Neil Fraser neat serve uh another
occasion Rod Laver
Second level Rod Laver in sixty-one 
And you know it's interesting to know that I've
 not lost to Lord Laver until then 
But on that occasion I was over awed and they were two two
of the best out pass two of the left that left handed again its known 
It so happened I had to play them on fast grass court
This I wouldn't play well and uh they were the better players
But I think if uh I should have been little more you know it
is one word a little more ambitious and you know I
played normally
I should have done something extra bit you know
On an occasion like that you can't afford to play just normal
tennis and get away
 You've to do something extra
Which I didn't do 
 Deepekji hamesha ki tarah aap meri baat mehmen tak
pahuncha dijiye 
Dekhye morning show ke lakho dost jo Bharat
ke puri abadi ke pratinidhi hai mai un sab ki taraf se mehman ka shukriya ada
karta hoon 
Mehman ni Bhartiya tennis ke liye jo kuch kiya
hai woh nai khiladiyon ko hamesha rasta dikhata rahega 
Meri aur morning show ke doston ki ek chhoti si
khwaish hai ho sakta hai woh mehman ki koshish se unki saakh se 
ya unki sifarish se puri ho jaye 
Is mahan desh ke kisi bhi ek saher main ek shandar
 tennis stadium ban jaye to hamari woh hasrat puri ho
jaye jo Australian Open French Open ya 
Wimbledon ko dekh kar hamare dil mei paida hoti hai 
What ?
Do you wish to respond to what he has said ?
Uh I understood him ahn 
Well as far as I'm concerned I'll be 
 rewarded and rewarded and very happy 
If we produce you know large country like India 
if we get two or three or four good players and good tennis
stadium yeah tennis court and everything 
 Ahn 
 Yes yes 
 And good tennis stadium 
That would be nice because you know we've 
worked very hard in this game 
I would like somebody to keep up this game and you know keep
the flag flying and uh I would like to again grow that's my
ambition 
Uh Mr Krishnan coming back to your reputation as a gentleman
tennis player
Now you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to
but I've heard again from your comtemporaries yeah 
that if there was ever a line called which the empire awarded in your
favour but you thought that it belong to the to your opponent 
then the next point you would deliberately return the ball into the net 
Is that true ?
That you would you would you know equalise
 Yeah 
Well I will tell you the truth now
I can afford to tell you the truth now laughter that 
I've close my tennis year
