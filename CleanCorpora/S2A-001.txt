<I>
For the introduction very kind of you 
A lot of work has uh gone on for long distance and particularly
uh
 as we noticed in the infield area
But uh there is a a little scope left for improvement
in
the outfield because that wasn't quite uh a part of football
occasion
Uhm the toss 
Not immediately clear who won but uh the two captains
Mohammad
Azharuddin leading the Indian Eleven and Amir Malik 
the wicket
keeper one of the few experienced boys in the
Pakistani Eleven 
Yeah 
 It's unfortunate that we haven't uh had the
pleasure of the to be say final of the Pakistan Eleven 
for this
match 
But there are a number of other matches coming in India and
of
course in Sharjah later so that uh a lot of people are
keeping things in
reserve can't blame them for that 
This after all is primarily a benefit one-day match and
the
two beneficiaries former Ranjit trophy stars from
Hyderabad 
Jyotiprasad and Habib Khan for whom of course this must be
a very big
occasion Ravi
Yeah 
True there is a lot of very good cricket coming up in
Sharjah back in India and of course down under for a few
month 
The Indian Eleven led by Mohammad Azharuddin Ravi Shastri
Shrikant will be seen back Dilip Vengasarkar Kapil Dev who
 has 
such a scintillating performance in the past five days
Everybody must be looking forward to see him perform again 
Manjrekar and Tendulkar the dynamic duo from Maharashtra
Manoj Prabhakar Kirmani is back but unfortunately he
doesn't
find a place in the Indian twenty-two announced yesterday
Arshad Ayub and Venkatpathi Raju providing the local 
flavour 
And one of the many fine buildings Hyderabad can be proud
of
Legislative Assembly 
So we would be seeing it during the match very often 
But here is the Pakistani Eleven led by Amir Malik 
wi wicket keeper Jahur Ilahi young
brother of
Mansur 
Mansur Rana who happened to be the son of Shakur Rana one
of
the leading umpires of Pakistan
Shahid Saeed Gafar Kazmi Mansur Ilahi another very
experienced player Suheil Fazal Javed Hayat Zakir
Khan and Tanvir
Mehadi will wear the brunt of the medium pace bowling and 
Sajjad 
Akbar 
The drop man Mujahir Jamshid who did very well in the under
nineteen sometime ago 
There was some delay in knowing the exact uh content of the
Pakistan Eleven but we are glad that all the players are now
here though some
of them have arrived very late
But uh of course cricket loving public of Hyderabad and of
India in general are glad that uh the full contingent
has arrived in
time 
Mansur Ilahi getting a liitle bit of batting in 
And uh near at the V I P stand 
A lot of hard work has gone in to make sure that this match
was held 
Ravi I believe Mohammad Azharuddin won the toss and has
elected to field 
So we will see some Pakistani batting first 
Mansur Ilahi would be looking forward to give another
scintillating
display 
I remember couple of performances in the Middle East where he
did
 uh exceedingly well some years ago 
But uhm thereafter I think he has been sort of in and out
really 
Yeah 
So he is a very explosive batsman and a very useful medium
pacer because I think one day cricket has given rise to uh 
to uh an
increasing number of alrounders where if you fail with one
 then you
can certainly try and uh get into the limelight with the
other 
Charu I think
I hear a section of the crowd still picking up actually
still early in the day but thats by mid-day we do hope to see a
a stadium
 full 
Here are the two umpires doing duty for the match 
Ramaswamy nearer us and behind him Shivram 
The capacity of the stadium is around uh twenty-five
thousand
ordinarily but I think it has been uh bolstered a bit by uh
additional stand 
So yes we do have a full house we can expect upto
thirty-five
thousand people 
Both the teams were earlier introduced to the Chief Minister
with the chief guest Mr N Janardan Reddy a very staunch
supporter of
sports 
And in his uh tenure already we had some very major events
in
Hyderabad particularly as you were mentioning earlier Ravi
the pre-
olympic football tournament two months ago 
And as you had mentioned the stadium received a complete 
face-lift 
And the facility is added particularly for the players and
uh
 others nearer the pavilion are now almost world
class
Which is very good for any venue really 
True and being from Hyderabad I can only add that the A P
government has left no stone unturned to make sure that uh the
finest
possible facilities uh have been incorporated into the
stadium 
Which had been languishing for a number of years I think it was
uh a basically in the year nineteen sixty-one or thereabout 
and since
then not much had been done
So the pre-Olympic Football was a big boon for sportslover in
Hyderabad 
See because unfortunately although we have the benefit of this
beautiful breeze that you just mentioned I think uh further
down in the
ground it may not be uh particularly heavy at this point of
time
So it would be very hard through the day
And October is uhm not the coldest month in Hyderabad 
It can get awfully hot but if the cloud cover does take up
bit
during the day then in fact in the later half we will get
better playing
conditions 
True
To remind you once again this will be a forty-five over a side
match 
The timings are uh well nine thirty really but I guess 
it's about to begin 
There will be a forty-five minute lunch break and the match will
resume at one fifteen till the end of play 
The Indian team taking the field Arshad Ayub at front 
led
of course by the captain Azharuddin who had a very
successful season
 for Derbyshire in the English county cricket league 
Most of the Summer
No he is a batsman for all seasons I don't think there is any
search of any occasion were uh 
The batting being open for Pakistan by their captain Amir Malik
also very useful opener and to his right in the green cap
 a county
cricket cap Jahur Ilahi who is Mansur's younger
brother 
And to remain in contention for the match fourteen 
at
this age is really a very fitting tribute to his uh 
physical prowess
 and of course his speed and effective diving behind the
wicket but 
like I mentioned earlier its a trifle disappointing in
one way to not
see him in the twenty-two probable announced yesterday 
Uhm and I am sure he must be very disappointed particularly 
The selection is is not an easy job at any time and I am
sure
the selectors must know what they are doing
 Meri khyal hai 
I think Kirmani is at an age almost where he might
qualify as a selector 
 Jee haan 
Jahur Ilahi all set 
He will be the non-striker 
And to open the innings Jahur
Amir
Amir Malik beg your pardon who is also the captain
And to open the Indian bowling Manoj Prabhakar 
Only one slip to begin with Dilip Vengasarkar 
Slightly dangerous way to begin that edge carrying 
quite
safely the second slip which of course didn't exist 
The ball stopped at the boundary by Kanwaljit Singh
who is also now a Hyderabad Ranji regular 
And two runs to Amir 
Manoj Prabhakar seeing the necessity of the second slip 
brings
one on 
There we have Kirmani behind the stumps 
Vengasarkar as uh first slip Venkatpathy Raju being
brought in as a second slip 
Arshad Ayub seen here with Manoj Prabhakar Ayub is at
mid
off 
 That's a nice ball 
A very useful swing bowler Manoj Prabhakar particularly
proving himself in Pakistan sometime ago 
And a very good run 
Another out swinger all four yes swinging out 
Ravi if I am not mistaken I think uh uh Manoj's 
important weapon is his inswinger which he swing by a yard
on occasions
uh in keeping that in a bit of check right now 
It has been 
Yes like on that occasion 
Wide of the crease a little faster action and quite a
classic inswinger 
Of course that one didn't swing too much 
That is record twenty-eight years old not a young been taken any
more 
Debut way back eight years ago 
End of a useful over 
A quiet beginning two run from the board for the Pakistan
Eleven 
The two men in for Pakistan Amir Malik their captain and
wicket keeper and Jahur Ilahi the younger brother of Mansur
 who will
now take strike against Kapil Dev 
I think the media has been full of praise for Kapil 
Dev's
 uh incredible performance in the Irani trophy 
Of course it is uh a team game so the whole team should get
the
credit but Kapil Dev is bringing out yet another magnificient
performance
with the ball and with the bat 
Ravi were you there in Faridabad when this was going on 
Yes same as old
And a hundred and seventy-five brilliant runs uh way back
in the world cup 
Zimbabwe unnees sau triyasi 
True and we were 
 Jab Bharat ne vishwa cup jeeta
 
We have got some very low score for five when he went in
 resolute thirty or some such thing
Quite an incredible fight like that
Five for forty-three is his best bowling performance 
Thirteen years of International cricket 
Now that is a very loose loose enough way down the leg
side 
But even Kapil Dev uh can have situations like
that
Kirmani I think caught by surprise having to try way to his
left 
Just about collected the ball 
So a wide one more to the Pakistani Eleven 
I think the laces may be to blame them tying them again
And Kanwaljit Singh an offspinner for the Hyderabadi
Ranji squad 
For Kapil Dev also two slip 
Dilip Vengasarkar maintaining first slip position and 
captain Azharuddin at the second 
I think that one was not a milimetre away from the central
stump because played well forward so no danger 
In the second over the Pakistani Eleven three for no
loss
Back foot into the covers Shrikant 
Jahur Ilahi opens his account with a break 
Manoj at third man gives only a single and that
brings Amir Malik onto the strike 
Amir Malik on two Jahur Ilahi on two one wide 
and
the total five 
I beg your pardon Jahur Ilahi has three to his credit 
A bit of lift on that ball and Amir seeing it well in
time let it go through 
And Kapil Dev too sort of angling through his first over 
Two slip another young Hyderabadi doing some duty for
the fielding side Noel David is now brought in at
third place 
Little change in the fielding Shrikant moved to point man
in the covers Kanwaljit Singh mid on 
Down the leg side and Kapil completes his first over 
Gentle nothing spectacular especially one as a who in
one is a battle squad thirty-two 
Yeah 
The field for Manoj Prabhakar two slip four men on the
off side third man point cover and mid off and
three men on
the on mid on mid wicket and fine leg 
Oh gone for four 
I think Jahur played inside the line expecting may be uh uh a
bigger swing but the ball pass straightning up the just a
bit and
catching the off stump 
Jahur Ilahi the first casualty for Pakistan and Ravi here
it
is again 
 In Hindi 
Its here in the loudspeaker on here somewhere laughter
But a very good ball 
And uh Jahur Ilahi I think more just beaten by the pace 
very
quick ball 
Next man in Mansur Rana 
Its right up Mansur gets the thirty-sixth outside
edge I don't think that was plan to go but it did 
I beg your pardon that's a Gaffar Kazmi we
had Mansur Rana in our list 
So that is Gaffar Kazmi now at the non-striker end 
having got in a single off the first ball he played 
Amir Malik minor change in field placing Venkatpathy
Raju
being brought in at third slip 
That well guided Kanwaljit is third man and Amir
gets single 
 That's a real inswinger but uh way out way down
the leg side so not much scope for damage there 
But the kind of the the amount of swing that we were talking
about earlier I mean he quite did it 
Slightly unusual in one day cricket we have three slips 
Uh that's a crackling drive of the front foot through
the
covers four runs 
We will have to beg your pardon one more time that is the
Pakistani paceman Zakir Khan in the green cap on the left now
Credited with that for now uh you will have to excuse us the
Pakistanis did come in at a very late stage and this is not
exactly their
regular eleven 
But as the match goes on I am sure uh we will all be far
more
comfortable about players 
Twelve for one at the completion of three overs 
Kapil Dev coming in again 
For him now two slip 
Noel David back at point little point 
Amir Malik 
Malik picks the quick single inspite Noel David rushing in
Still early in the inning so thats some good understanding
and
good running 
Thats Noel David youngster now becoming a teacher in the
Hyderabad Ranji team 
Azharuddin lot of responsibility in his shoulders
 on his shoulders in the coming months
So far uh declared captain for the Sharjah and the
India
Pak one day series to be held in India 
Later in uh when does it begin now November isn't it ?
Yeah 
Zakir Khan carefully to midoff and I think Zakir will
get uh to his own stuff when they go into ball 
One heard a lot about him in in in 
uh for the year having gone by but uh he hasn't really
become a
regular feature of the Pakistani squad so far 
 Iska matlab Imran Khan Wasim Akram Salim
Jafar Waqur Yunus 
 Waqur Yunus 
Waqur Yunus 
Lot of despair 
Aquib Javed 
True a run from fine leg 
Ayub doing fielding 
Arshad incidently has done a lot of organisational work in this
match 
Yeah 
I think some credit that this match is being held must go to
Arshad 
In and out of the Indian team for the past few years
unfortunately
 particularly for his uh region or fans in Hyderabad
Out good work by Kirmani diving way to his right 
picked up the ball from the front of uh 
First slip
First slip and Amir Malik trudging back to the pavilion
The second wicket down for the Pakistani Eleven with
just
about what's the score now ?
Fourteen
Fourteen runs on the board
