""
""
For the introduction 
""
A lot of work has uh gone on for long distance and particularly
uh
 in the infield area
""
But uh  a a little scope left for improvement
in
the outfield because that wasn't quite uh  a part of football
occasion
""
""
Uhm 
""
Not immediately clear who won but uh  the two captains
Mohammad
Azharuddin 
the wicket
keeper  boys in the
Pakistani Eleven 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 had the
pleasure of the 
for this
match 
""
But there are a number of other matches coming  in India and
of
course in Sharjah later so that uh  a lot of people are
keeping things in
reserve 
""
This after all is  and
the
two beneficiaries  from
Hyderabad 
Jyotiprasad and Habib Khan  for whom of course this must be
a very big
occasion Ravi
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
True there is a lot of very good cricket coming up  in
Sharjah  for a few
month 
""
The Indian Eleven led by Mohammad Azharuddin  Ravi Shastri
Shrikant will be seen back  Dilip Vengasarkar Kapil Dev who
""
such a scintillating performance in the past five days
""
Everybody must be looking forward to see him perform again 
""
Manjrekar and Tendulkar  the dynamic duo from Maharashtra
""
Manoj Prabhakar  Kirmani is back but unfortunately he
doesn't
find a place in the  Indian twenty-two announced yesterday
""
""
Arshad Ayub and Venkatpathi Raju 
flavour 
""
And one of the many fine buildings Hyderabad can  be proud
of
Legislative Assembly 
""
So we would be seeing it during the match very often 
""
But here is the Pakistani Eleven 
""
wi  young
brother of
Mansur 
""
Mansur Rana who happened to be the son of Shakur Rana  one
of
the leading umpires of Pakistan
""
Shahid Saeed  Mansur Ilahi another very
experienced player  Zakir
Khan and Tanvir
Mehadi will wear the brunt of the medium pace bowling and 
Sajjad 
Akbar 
""
The drop man Mujahir Jamshid  who did very well in the under
nineteen sometime ago 
""
There was some delay in knowing the exact uh  content of the
Pakistan Eleven but we are glad that all the players are now
here though some
of them have arrived very late
""
But uh of course  cricket loving public of Hyderabad and of
India in general  the full contingent
has arrived in
time 
""
Mansur Ilahi 
""
And uh near at the V I P stand 
""
""
A lot of hard work has gone in to make sure that this match
was held 
""
""
Ravi I believe Mohammad Azharuddin won the toss and has
elected to field 
""
So we will see some 
""
Mansur Ilahi would be looking forward to give another
scintillating
display 
""
I remember couple of performances in the Middle East where he
did
""
""
But uhm  thereafter I think he has been sort of in and out
really 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So he is a very explosive batsman and a very useful medium
pacer because I think one day cricket has given rise to uh 
to uh  an
increasing number of alrounders  where if you fail with one
 then you
can certainly try and uh  get into the limelight with the
other 
""
""
Charu I think
""
""
I hear a section of the crowd  still picking up actually
still early in the day but thats by mid-day we do hope to see a
a stadium
""
""
Here are the two umpires 
Ramaswamy nearer us 
""
The capacity of the stadium is around uh  twenty-five
thousand
ordinarily but I think it has been uh  bolstered a bit by uh
""
additional stand 
""
So  yes we do have a full house we can expect upto
thirty-five
thousand people 
""
Both the teams were earlier introduced to the Chief Minister
""
with the chief guest Mr N Janardan Reddy  a very staunch
supporter of
sports 
""
And in his uh  tenure already we had some very major events
in
Hyderabad  particularly as you were mentioning earlier Ravi
the pre-
olympic football tournament two months ago 
""
And as you had mentioned the stadium received a complete 
face-lift 
""
And  the facility is added particularly for the players and
uh
 almost world
class
""
Which is very good for any venue really 
""
True and being from Hyderabad I can only add that the A P
government has left no stone unturned to make sure that uh the
finest
possible facilities  uh have been incorporated into the
stadium 
""
Which had been languishing for a number of years I think it was
""
uh a basically in the year nineteen sixty-one or thereabout 
and since
then not much had been done
""
So the pre-Olympic Football was a big boon for sportslover in
Hyderabad 
""
See because unfortunately although we have the benefit of this
""
beautiful breeze that you just mentioned I think uh  further
down in the
ground it may not be uh  particularly heavy at this point of
time
""
So it would be very hard  through the day
""
And October is uhm 
""
It can get awfully hot  but if the cloud cover does take up
bit
during the day then in fact in the later half  we will get
better playing
conditions 
""
""
True
""
""
To remind you once again this will be a forty-five over a side
match 
""
The timings are uh 
it's 
""
There will be a forty-five minute lunch break and the match will
resume at one fifteen 
""
The Indian team taking the field 
led
of course by the captain  who had a very
successful season
""
""
""
Most of the Summer
""
""
No he is a batsman for all seasons I don't think there is any
search of any occasion were uh 
""
The batting being open for Pakistan by their captain Amir Malik
also very useful opener and to his right  in the green cap
 a county
cricket cap  younger
brother 
""
And to remain 
at
this age is really a 
physical prowess
 and of course his speed and effective diving behind the
wicket but 
like I mentioned earlier its a trifle  in
one way to not
see him in the twenty-two probable announced yesterday 
""
Uhm and I am sure he must be very disappointed particularly 
""
The selection is is  not an easy job at any time and I am
sure
the selectors  must know what they are doing
""
""
""
""
""
I think Kirmani is at an age  where he might
qualify as a selector 
""
""
""
""
""
Jahur Ilahi 
""
He will be the non-striker 
""
And to open the innings  Jahur
""
""
Amir
""
""
Amir Malik beg your pardon  who is also the captain
""
And 
""
Only one slip 
""
Slightly dangerous way to begin 
quite
safely the second slip 
""
The ball stopped at the boundary  Kanwaljit Singh
""
who is also now a Hyderabad Ranji regular 
""
And two runs to 
""
Manoj Prabhakar seeing the necessity of the second slip 
brings
one on 
""
There we have Kirmani behind the stumps 
""
Vengasarkar as uh  Venkatpathy Raju being
brought in 
""
Arshad Ayub  Ayub is at
mid
off 
""
""
""
A very useful swing bowler  particularly
proving himself in Pakistan sometime ago 
""
And a very good run 
""
Another out swinger 
""
Ravi if I am not mistaken I think uh uh 
important weapon is his inswinger  which he swing by a yard
on occasions
uh 
""
""
It has been 
""
""
Yes like on that occasion 
""
Wide of the crease  and quite a
classic inswinger 
""
Of course that one didn't swing too much 
""
That is record twenty-eight years old not a young been taken any
more 
""
Debut way back eight years ago 
""
End of a useful over 
""
A quiet beginning  two run from the board for the Pakistan
Eleven 
""
The two men in for Pakistan  Amir Malik their captain and
wicket keeper and Jahur Ilahi  the younger brother of Mansur
 who will
now 
""
I think the media has been full 
Dev's
""
""
Of course it is uh a team game so  the whole team should get
the
credit but Kapil Dev is bringing out yet another magnificient
performance
with the ball 
""
Ravi were you there in Faridabad when this was going on 
""
""
Yes same as old
""
""
And a hundred and seventy-five brilliant runs uh  way back
in the world cup 
""
""
Zimbabwe 
""
""
True 
""
""
 jeeta
""
""
""
We have got some  very low score for five when he went in
 thirty or some such thing
""
Quite an incredible fight like that
""
Five for forty-three is his best bowling performance 
""
Thirteen years of International cricket 
""
Now that is a very loose  way down the leg
side 
""
But even  situations like
that
""
""
Kirmani I think caught by surprise having to  try way to his
left 
""
Just about collected the ball 
""
So a wide 
""
I think the laces may be  tying them again
""
""
And Kanwaljit Singh  for the Hyderabadi
Ranji squad 
""
For Kapil Dev also two slip 
""
Dilip Vengasarkar 
captain Azharuddin 
""
I think that one was not  a milimetre away from the central
stump 
""
In the second over  three for no
loss
""
""
Back foot into the covers 
""
Jahur Ilahi opens his account 
""
Manoj  and that
brings Amir Malik onto the strike 
""
Amir Malik on two 
and
the total 
""
I beg your pardon Jahur Ilahi 
""
A bit of lift on that ball  seeing it well in
time let it go through 
""
And Kapil Dev too sort of angling through his first over 
""
Two slip  doing some duty for
the fielding side Noel David  at
third place 
""
Little change in the fielding Shrikant moved to point  man
in the covers 
""
Down the leg side and Kapil completes his first over 
""
Gentle  especially one as a who in
one 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
The field for Manoj Prabhakar two slip  four men on the
off side  and
three men  on
the on 
""
""
Oh gone for four 
""
""
I think Jahur played inside the line expecting may be uh uh a
bigger swing  but the ball pass straightning up the just a
bit  and
catching the off stump 
""
Jahur Ilahi  the first casualty for Pakistan and Ravi here
it
is again 
""
""
""
""
""
Its here in the loudspeaker on here somewhere  laughter
""
""
But a very good ball 
""
And uh Jahur Ilahi I think more just beaten by the pace 
very
quick ball 
""
Next man in 
""
Its right up  outside
edge I don't think that was plan to go but it did 
""
I beg your pardon  we
had Mansur Rana in our list 
""
So that is Gaffar Kazmi 
having got in a single off the first ball he played 
""
Amir Malik  Venkatpathy
Raju
being brought in 
""
That well guided  and Amir
gets single 
""
 way down
the leg side so not much scope for damage there 
""
But the kind of  the the amount of swing that we were talking
about earlier 
""
Slightly unusual in one day cricket we have three slips 
""
Uh  a crackling drive of the front foot through
the
covers 
""
We will have to beg your pardon one more time that is  the
Pakistani paceman Zakir Khan in the green cap on the left now
""
""
Credited with that for now uh you will have to excuse us the
Pakistanis did come in at a very late stage and this is not
exactly their
regular eleven 
""
But as the match goes on I am sure uh  we will all be far
more
comfortable about players 
""
Twelve for one 
""
Kapil Dev coming in again 
""
For him now two slip 
""
Noel David back at point 
""
Amir Malik 
""
Malik picks the quick single  inspite Noel David rushing in
""
""
Still early in the inning  so thats some good understanding
and
good running 
""
Thats Noel David  youngster now becoming a teacher in the
Hyderabad Ranji team 
""
Azharuddin  in his shoulders
 in the coming months
""
""
So far uh  and the
India
Pak one day series to be held in India 
""
Later in uh  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Zakir Khan  carefully to midoff and I think Zakir will
get uh 
""
One heard a lot about him 
""
uh  he hasn't really
become a
regular feature 
""
""
 Salim
Jafar 
""
""
""
""
""
Waqur Yunus 
""
""
Lot of 
""
""
Aquib Javed 
""
""
True 
""
Ayub 
""
Arshad incidently has done a lot of organisational work in this
match 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
I think some credit that this match is being held must go to
Arshad 
""
In and out of the Indian team for the past few years
unfortunately
 region or fans in Hyderabad
""
""
Out 
picked up the ball from the front of uh 
""
""
First slip
""
""
First slip  and Amir Malik trudging back to the pavilion
""
""
The second wicket  with
just
about  ?
""
""
Fourteen
""
""
Fourteen runs on the board
