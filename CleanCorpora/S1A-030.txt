<I>
How do you like the place Prabha 
I like it fine the only thing it doesn't agree with my
constitution with weather 
Yes I too find it uh little bit chill 
What about you Uma 
No I think when I came here initially I wasn't well 
Now I think I got accustomed to this climate and other thing 
How about you 
No initially it didn't affect me but I think uh now my
resistance is much less uhm and I have got sore
throat cold
 Uhm 
Uhm I think it must be also because that you are away from
your son
Yeah ah 
By the way how old is your son 
He is twelve and he is in ninth standard 
Twelve and in ninth standard
Yes
But it is very early I think in school
I I too think so 
He is very young for the class 
How many kids do you have 
I have uh just one 
What about you Uma
I have got two 
Got a son in fifth standard ah and a daughter 
she is admitted in KG in one word 
 Ah 
Won't they miss you
Definitely 
I have written to my son
And my husband also has written to me saying that he miss me a lot
What about you Prabha
Haven't you received any letter from home
I have written to them
 I'm expecting a reply from
How many kids you have
Two kids
Both girls I have never left them alone till now
Which class are they
Fifth and Sixth
Girls in yes the problem of platting the hair
washing the hair
I don't know what they are doing at home
 Yes 
My husband must be just keeping the cooker and they must be
eating just daal and rice
When you go
Your husband is a good cook I think
No he not I don't say he is a good cook but he will manage
somehow I think
Yeah yeah
Know when we go back no I think we'll get a rosy
welcome home welcome there 
 Yes laughter 
Everybody would have missed us a lot no 
Perhaps they will understand our value better then 
All the work which we did then
Yeah 
Sometime this parting is necessary no yeah 
temporary parting 
Especially one or two words 
 Yeah 
Yeah we'll also realise their importance and 
they'll also one word 
Ah yes
Especially my son's case no he is very much
attached 
I feel uh that this separation will help him to uh get
 uh become a little bit independent 
But the only thing I'm bothered is regarding his studies
no 
Because I help him a lot with his studies 
Now of course he's got to get the help of his
father or grand parents or someone else 
 Uhm 
 Ayyo my daughters were saying you know 
 yeah before I left they were saying how will we study
 Yeah 
Because I'm the one who coaches them 
My husband comes at very late from work 
And he doesn't have much time to attain to their studies 
So all their studying the home work part and all that they feel as
if no like it's like even though I would they would have
felt uh mummy is not letting us play and all so long 
Now that uh strictness is removed from them they I think 
they'll feel a bit insecure 
So they were asking me
My son too needs me 
Otherwise he won't touch the book 
I don't know what he he is doing in my absence 
May be he's cutting his tution classes and uh
just whiling away the time 
But he is with your parents no
Yes a few words pamper pamper him a lot 
 It's okay just for a month 
For a change let him get pampered then he will change back to his
normal routine 
How about your hobbies and all 
What do you do during your
I I I play with my son yeah 
He doesn't like chess because he has to use his brain
 Yeah 
 Brain well
He like shuttle cock better than that 
 So I play 
 No even for shuttle cock you have to use your
brain
You have to one or two words 
 No one or two words maybe that 
kind of 
 Kind of but it would be better than an indoor
game no 
No it's an indoor game only 
Uhm
Oh shuttle cock 
But I play it as an outdoor game 
Of course when it's very windy we can't do that 
And he expects me to run about just like uh 
uhm young girl uhm which I'm not able to do
So very often he wins and I lose 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Only you lost to your little son 
What about you 
What do you do during your spare time
 My hobby is tailoring and uh some
painting 
 A few words 
 Do you sing 
Do you sing 
Sing I like to sing but where is the time except in the
bathroom or in the kitchen laughter 
But you learn music 
Uh I learnt when I was young I learn
Ah 
I love singing in fact I want to learn along with my
daughters
I want to uh join them in a music class and I also want to
learn 
But at present there is no time and no energy also 
What about you 
I spent my time reading a lot of fiction one or two
words 
There is time for all that one or two words 
 A few words no somehow I do it I read
 half an hour a day
 It's a wonder 
I get books from the library no 
So naturally I'm forced to return it within a week 
Somehow uhm I get the time somehow and read it
 Uhm 
My I never manage to read a story book during my school days
you know
Ah
I have joined a lending library but I enjoy 
and take a book only in the month of May
 One or two words 
Uh 
Only in the month of May I'll take 
About ten to twenty books I'll read that's 
all
I never I can never resist a book somehow 
 But I 
 Here also go to library 
 As far as I can never resist a book 
 Yeah it's nice to have that habit 
But somewhere at the dining table uhm 
somewhere when everybody is watching TV uhm I will go and
sit and read
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
No I have a very bad habit
If there is a story book I won't do anything else till I 
 yeah finish the story book once I started
 Yeah 
I know that that's not possible 
So while while the milk is boiling I just stand there with
the book in my hand and one or to words and I read the book 
See somehow I manage to finish the book 
Very difficult once the school starts na
 uhm very difficult 
 Uhm 
I don't know how I'm going to get back into that
routine you know now
Uhm 
Quite relaxed I'm now then I'll have to
go and whatever I do now whatever time I take just to get ready 
 I'll have to cook get my children ready and I've to get

No intendent intention of going 
 See you can go in vacation and come 
You know what what Madras is hot and there

experience you can go and see the life style of the people
there 
 Or maybe to one word 
I don't like to leave to India 
No no you can see what is costly what is cheap over there
 laughter and you can come here and relate your
experience 
 Everything is costly 
Yeah everything is costly
But I think for a non-veg it will be cheaper
I heard that you get camels meat and all in large quantities
No but I don't eat camel's meat laughter 
You can get used to eating it but it is very tasty 
Only vegetarian food is costly over there 
Vegetables don't grow there I think know

Ah but you think lots of teaching teaching
 job
 Teaching

There is scope for teaching
 A few words 
See many of they
 No I told you I don't like it 
 The teachers are very well paid 
I don't like to leave India
Nearly fifteen thousand rupees per month you
know that 
Whatever it is I'm not very much attracted by those
jobs
Uhm 
Because I feel secure when I'm in India
 That's right 
And in case there is some uh problem there 
uhm both of us will have to come back and we won't have anything
stable in India
 Uhm 
Brothers and sisters you have

atleast one or two words with the neighbours 
I don't know what they must be thinking of me but of course I
Even I I live in a flat

So naturally when there are forty-eight flats
there yeah flats there and so inspite of that just I won't be
able to talk for even five minutes with my neighbour uhm 
Means hardly five minutes I spend with them no
Just while going to school I'll just say hello and
then in the evening by this all uhm 
Nothing at all no time to go and talk
 Flats there
