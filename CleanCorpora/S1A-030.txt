constitution with weather

""
Now I think I got accustomed to this climate and other thing 
""
How about you 
""
""
No initially it didn't affect me but I think  uh now my
resistance  sore
throat  cold

""
""
""
""
Uhm  I think it must be also because that you are away from
your son

""
Yeah ah 
""
""
By the way how old is your son

eating just  and rice
""
""
When you go
""
""
Your husband is a good cook I think
""
""
No he not I don't say he is a good cook but he will manage
somehow I think
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""

welcome home 
""
""
""
""
""
Everybody would have missed us a lot no 
""
""
Perhaps they will understand our value better then 
""
All the work which we did then
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Sometime this parting is necessary no 
temporary parting 
""
Especially 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
they'll 
""
""
Ah yes
""
""
Especially my  he is very much
attached 
""
I feel  uh get
""
""
But the only thing  bothered is regarding his studies
no 
""
Because I help him a lot with his studies 
""
Now  got to get the help of his
father or grand parents or someone else 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 how will we study
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because 
""
My husband comes at very late from work 
""
And he doesn't have much time to attain to their studies 
""
So all their studying the home work part and all that they feel as
if no  even though I would they would have
felt 
""
Now that uh strictness is removed from them 
they'll 
""
So they were asking me
""
""
My son too needs me 
""
Otherwise he won't touch the book 
""
I don't know what he 
""
May be  uh
just whiling away the time 
""
""
But he is with your parents no
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
For a change let him get pampered then he will change back to his
normal routine 
""
""
How about your hobbies and all 
""
What do you do during your
""
""
I I 
""
He doesn't like chess because he has to use his  brain
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
He like 
""
""
""
""
 shuttle cock you have to use your
brain
""
You have to 
""
""
""
kind of 
""
""
 but it would be better than an indoor
game no 
""
""
No 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Oh shuttle cock 
""
""
But I play it as an outdoor game 
""
Of course when 
""
And he expects me to run about 
uhm  not able to do
""
""
So very often he wins 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Only you lost to your little son 
""
""
What about you 
""
What do you do during your spare time
""
""

painting 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Do you sing 
""
""
Sing  I like to sing but where is the time except in the
bathroom or in the kitchen 
""
""
But you learn music 
""
""
Uh I learnt when I was young I learn
""
""
Ah 
""
""
I love singing  in fact I want to learn along with my
daughters
""
I want to  uh join them in a music class and I also want to
learn 
""
But at present there is no time and no energy also 
""
""
What about you 
""
""
I spent my time reading a lot of fiction  one or two
words 
""
""
There is time for all that 
""
""
 I read
 half an hour a day
""
""
""
""
""
I get books from the library no 
""
So naturally 
""
Somehow  I get the time somehow and read it
""
""
""
""
""
My I never manage to read a story book during my school days
you know
""
""
Ah
""
""
I have joined a lending library 
and take a book only in the month of May
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Only in the month of May 
""
About ten to twenty books 
all
""
""
I never I can never resist a book somehow 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But somewhere at the dining table 
somewhere when everybody is watching TV  I will go and
sit and read
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No I have a very bad habit
""
If there is a story book I won't do anything else 
 once I started
""
""
""
""
""
I know that 
""
So while  I just stand there with
the book in my hand and 
""
See somehow I manage to finish the book 
""
""
Very difficult  na

experience  of the people
there 
""
""
""
""
""
I don't like to leave 
""
""
No no you can see what is costly  what is cheap over there
 you can come here and relate your
experience 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah everything is costly
""
""
But I think for a non-veg it will be cheaper
""
I heard that you get camels meat and all in large quantities
""
""
No but I don't eat 
""
""
""
You can get used to eating it but it is very tasty 
""
""
Only vegetarian food is costly over there 
""
""
Vegetables don't grow there I think know
""
""
Yeah
""
""
They have to 
""
Everything has to be imported

""
""
""
""
""
See many of they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I don't like to leave India
""
""
Nearly fifteen thousand  per month you
know that 
""
""
Whatever it is  not very much attracted by those
jobs
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Because  in India
""
""
""
""
""
And in case there is some 
uhm  we won't have anything
stable in India
""
""
""
""
""
Brothers and sisters you have 
""
""
Yes  I have two brothers and two sisters
""
""
Oh all are in India 
""
""
All are in Madras  except my elder sister
""
She is in Pondecherry 
""
""
""
""
""
What about you 
""
""
I have got only one brother  and he is employed in Madras
""
""
My parents stay quite close by 
""
So I visit them almost every evening 
""
My daughter stays with them 
""
Only my son stays with me
""
""
What about you 
""
""
I have  they are all in Thiruvangal
""
""
""
""
""
Oh in Madras only 
""
""
I have one sister 
""
""
So  or so you go and meet them
""
""
""
""
""
Where is the time 
""
We never go 
""
Only my poor  parents will only come
""
""
""
""
""
Oh
""
""
I never stir out of the house 
""
In fact I don't even know who my neighbours are 
""
Of course I know them  I don't mean it literally
""
""
No I know 
""
""
Where is the time to talk  day today events with them
""
""
Yes
""
""
I think  a waste of time no
""
Once we enter the house if we talk to the neighbours uh
""
""
I don't know my  friend he manages to spent
atleast 
""
I don't know what they must be thinking of me  but of course I
""
""
""
Even I I live in a flat
""
""
Not 
""
""
So naturally when there are forty-eight  flats
there  just I won't be
able to talk for even five minutes with my neighbour 
""
Means hardly five minutes I spend with them no
""
Just while going to school  just say hello and
then in the evening by this all 
""
Nothing at all no time to go and talk
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And they are so helpful  because we are away most of the
day no
""
""
She is also  working
""
""
Yeah when that uh 
 sometime empty gas cylinders and all we have to leave down
""
All this my husband talk with them 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 when
""
""
""
No you have no other go  to do it
""
""
Because  uh no my
neighbours are not very close
""
""
Uhm  so
""
""
But my son makes up for it 
""
There is a little boy there  so my son goes and
plays with that boy 
""
And they very thick friends
""
Only we elders we don't have much time to  converse and talk
and all
""
""
""
