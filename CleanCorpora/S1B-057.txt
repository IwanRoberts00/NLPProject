Emerging optimism  is basically
because of the policies of the government 
""
A response 
""
The Indian community has a great sense of patriotism and tolerance
""
""
Our late 
Indiraji Gandhi has said  strength never comes from
the comfort of smooth path  of the efforts
""
""
Honourable President in his address there are sixth state situation
in Jammu and Kashmir I think
""
That is quite sufficient 
United States  interfere in the
matters of Jammu and Kashmir 
""
And not to teach us 
""
It is that I must say  a minor national minorities
finance development corporation has been set up 
crores 
""
And a new  nineteen ninety-three
will definitely help 
""
""
With this 
 employment
assurance scheme 
Safai Karmacharya  in
the development of our 
""
Let us be proud of all the men and women who are doing their best
in building our nation 
""
We are approaching twenty-first century  and twenty-first
century will be of  the honesty the integrity the accountability the
productivity 
""
And we intend to pursue all our efforts to produce 
more electricity  and more of the
basic needs of our people 
""
Our government and our political system 
technologically and otherwise  to be
mortgaged outside by an outside funds 
""
So friends we must come  together we should march ahead for the
self-reliance 
""
We should call little operation forward 
""
""
Shri Pawan Kumar Bansal 
""
""
Sir  and
lack of self-confidence  when the
present government 
""
It was a doubting task  particularly as a minority government
 in situations that least settled
""
""
Rejuvenate the economy  and regain
 that was its lowest at
its lowest ebb then 
""
In June nineteen ninety-one  there was a frightening question
mark 
""
A resolute endeavour  was steadly transforming that into a ray
of hope  on sixth of December
nineteen 
communal 
""
With the fall of  dangers of equating democracy
 ascerting or claiming to act on behalf of
the majority 
""
This 
honour 
""
Clouds of uncertainity started hovering  for the economic
reforms 
""
The foreign investors  disability
""
communal 
""
It was  unpleasant prospect
""
""
The deliberate  and concerted effect from forces from within
and across the borders  only strengthen
the resolve of the prime minister  with greater vigour
""
""
The people also extended support 
""
Sir today  attaining
majority in this house  which we have witnessed
over the last two and a half years  a friend on the
other side some false hopes 
""
And the subsequent event 
""
The prime  and
about the 
""
With the brightening up of  the investment climate in our
country  are pouring in faster than never
before 
""
The government on its part 
 tinkle with the
basic postulates of a mixed economy 
would be adversely affected thereby 
""
Fears and strength on behalf of the workers  a few
words  seem to be only stimulated for
critical purposes 
""
All ventures are rather intended to create greater 
opportunities for the people to improve 
""
Sir  the sober and mature leadership
provided to the country by Shri P V Narasimha Rao  has dealt that our
stock has risen in the international community 
""
A position that Kashmir  is
once again appreciated by a 
Pakistans'  to rake up the matter in the international meet
""
""
So the president has unequivocally  expressed the feeling of
the issue  of
the nation 
""
When we take over  a
feeling of most cordial relations  with
whom we have much in common 
""
We hold our ground firmly on issues like Kashmir  non-
proliferation treaty  as a need to face the United Nation Security
Council 
""
Terrorism  has been met
remarkably in  and the government is determined to fight it
""
""
Donning the robes of  Shri Jaswant Singhji
 and he was uncredible using the word charge
again and again sir 
""
He charged the government for not raising Hazrat Bal shrine  so
that  with which the government dealt with the
issue 
""
And who can deny the perceptible improvement in the situation
thereafter 
""
Sir but it causes agony  because it has
deprived them  cake
""
""
Sir  intends
to take India 
""
And our confidence  eminent from our
""
""
We are proud of our past  and have duplicit faith in the future
""
""
We believe 
""
We believe  should be addressed to
""
""
Sir  which
dominate our thinking on every score  certain goals which
we wish to achieve  struggle
in achieving those would become a little adverse one  and if it becomes
adverse  Narasimha Raoji
""
""
He would remain unflinching in his determination  to achieve
those goals 
""
""
""
Indrajit Gupta 
""
""
We were discussing the budget just now 
""
With the great uh  incentives which have been provided
by the finance minister for the  of the
private sector  both domestic private sector as well as foreign investors
""
""
I am afraid this growth of black money  will be further
accelerated 
""
This is a sort of encouragement to what we should call financial
criminality 
""
Corruption is too 
""
In some countries it is referred to it as financial criminality 
""
That is what is being fostered now in our country 
""
The 
consciously or unconsciously I don't know whoever prepared the address 
obviously did it consciously  all reference to this
 and has given no indication of the type of people
who are indulging  in this kind
of 
""
So on the twenty-nineth of January  news item
 The
Statesman 
""
Giving a list of forty-two  belonging to different
parties 
""
I  who had uh
""
Hizbul Mujahideen  Bomblasts
""
""
I don't know what is the political connection I can't uh 
easily find it out 
""
But anyway  this is a case there in the Supreme Court now
pending 
""
Their names are given in this news item along with  the amounts
of money which they are alleged to have received 
""
Among that  number of people come from the
 the
""
 fewer fewer
""
""
""
Sir these are all honourable gentlemen 
""
Most of them are members of parliament some have been ministers
some are presently minister 
publishes this kind of  should either be
proceeded against by way of defamation proceedings  in the court which has
not been done 
""
Or atleast the people who are named among these forty-two 
should have come out publicly with some 
which has not been done 
""
I neither know whether this allegations are correct or can be
correct or not 
""
But what is surprising me is you see a news report like this 
had created quite a lot of  and pendomonium among the
public who read these papers 
""
But no contradictions denials or  defamation case or anything is
coming 
""
So this is very curious 
""
And I want to draw the attention to this house that  the
honourable members concerned  should really be more serious about this
and take uh 
""
But nothing has been done 
""
So my point is  these
cases will go on multiplying 
""
Not because of any individuals  proclamities because of what I
said there is a economic and social forces are operating 
""
Black money is at the root of it  and black money is leading to
proliferation of this 
""
And the more that spreads  people are thinking that well so many
people  whether MPs or ministers or anybody else
 also got something to do with this corruption
""
Is that good for the future of our country  ?
""
So I am saying that this is a matter which everybody  should
take seriously 
""
The  say anything about
these things
""
It doesn't  say anything
""
It doesn't even mention 
last year  which was the scam
""
""
Is it just a small trivial matter  ?
""
Is there no mention about it  ?
""
You could say that such a thing happened we set-up a  joint
parliamentary committee  two words
 prime
minister has assured parliament that  a follow up action will be taken
against people who are guilty and all that 
""
There is no mention of the fact 
crores 
some people say 
""
The Bofors is chicken feed compare to this 
""
Bofors was only some sixty sixty-five 
""
Eight thousand to twelve thousand 
which was 
""
Why do public put money in the banks  ?
""
Because they believe that it is in safe custody when it is in the
banks 
""
In small people also pensioners  small people put money in the
banks 
""
But if  rupees
""
banks' 
bankers  and so many types of people who are in nexus
with each other
""
That money is funnelled out 
""
In order to go and  put money in the hands of these
speculators on the 
""
Is it a small matter ?
""
Such a thing never happened in our country before 
 affected mainly the public sector banking
system 
""
The nationalised banks  about which Indira Gandhi has spoken
at the time of nationalisation  that these are going to be the real
commanding heights of the economy 
""
Now what what is happening  ?
""
So 
address
""
So how can I thank him for this address I don't know  which
completely 
""
And what fate will other committees have  ?
""
If the J P C 
""
When the debate took place here in this house  some people were
doing their best to  such a report to dilute it and to say
which is not of much consequence 
""
So what will be the fate of other committees ?
""
What will be the fate of these uh  uh standing committees
which are now operating 
""
What will happen to their reports and their  recommends
""
""
No body will bother about 
""
See  part of our system isn't it ?
""
""
""
It all depends how you look at it how much you  respect those
 carry out what they say
or not 
""
We are in a parliamentary form of government
""
If you want to have some other form of government of course it is
different matter 
""
But so long as this country has been commited to the parliamentary
democracy form of government multi-party system based on adult franchise 
so long you cannot escape what is called parliamentary accountability 
""
 biggest and only surviving super
power in the world today  fish in troubled
waters  and their spokesman have been coming out with so
many statements which are patently  anti-Indian
sovereignity 
""
I believe Mr Chavan has said something quite 
right  about this yesterday
""
If 
""
And uh  President's
""
because I want to point out one thing it is not correct that will be wrong to
think  that what they what the Americans are raking up is only a question
of human rights 
""
""
""
They are talking about a civil war  they say civil war is
going on 
""
In his  to the General
Assembly of the United Nations the President Clinton has said it  that
conditions of civil war 
""
Civil war is a term which has a
