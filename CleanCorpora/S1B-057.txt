 Dr Vasant Pawar 
Emerging optimism and this optimism is basically
because of the policies of the government 
A response by the people of our country 
The Indian community has a great sense of patriotism and tolerance
 and we have to struggle hard 
Our late prime minister our leader Smt 
Indiraji Gandhi has said I quote strength never comes from
the comfort of smooth path but from the most sterness of the efforts
 unquote 
Honourable President in his address there are sixth state situation
in Jammu and Kashmir I think
That is quite sufficient a warning to the Pakistan and the 
United States of America not to fear interfere in the
matters of Jammu and Kashmir 
And not to teach us the human rights 
It is that I must say that a minor national minorities
finance development corporation has been set up and five hundred 
crores are kept for the development of minorities 
And a new Wakf Bill nineteen ninety-three
will definitely help in deciding the matters of wakf 
With this the development of the poor by way of 
 Jawahar Rozgar Yojna for I R D P employment
assurance scheme Mahila Samrudhi Yojna 
Safai Karmacharya they are the main milestones in
the development of our poor and down-trodden people 
Let us be proud of all the men and women who are doing their best
in building our nation 
We are approaching twenty-first century and twenty-first
century will be of the honesty the integrity the accountability the
productivity and the quality also 
And we intend to pursue all our efforts to produce more oil 
more electricity more fertilisers more foodgrains and more of the
basic needs of our people 
Our government and our political system are strong enough 
technologically and otherwise not to allow our self- reliance to be
mortgaged outside by an outside funds 
So friends we must come together we should march ahead for the
self-reliance 
We should call little operation forward faster and forward 
Shri Pawan Kumar Bansal 
Sir in an ambience of widely present chaos and
lack of self-confidence that permeated the national thought when the
present government took over the responsibility 
It was a doubting task particularly as a minority government
 to rebuild brick by brick in situations that least settled
Rejuvenate the economy that was in a shamble and regain
 practice in the comedy of nations that was its lowest at
its lowest ebb then 
In June nineteen ninety-one there was a frightening question
mark mocking at us about the future of India 
A resolute endeavour was steadly transforming that into a ray
of hope when suddenly a cataclysmic event on sixth of December
nineteen ninety-two threw the nation in the throes of 
communal two words 
With the fall of the mosque dangers of equating democracy
 with the tyranny of group ascerting or claiming to act on behalf of
the majority religious communities became real 
This cast a telling impacts not only on India's 
honour but also our economy 
Clouds of uncertainity started hovering for the economic
reforms initiated one word by the present government 
The foreign investors grew doubtful about the disability
 of investing in a country which was in the whirlpool of 
communal unrest 
It was with this uncertain and unpleasant prospect
 that we entered the year under review 
The deliberate and concerted effect from forces from within
and across the borders to destabilise the country only strengthen
the resolve of the prime minister to fight that with greater vigour
The people also extended support in ample measure 
Sir today with Congress attaining
majority in this house these reckless moves which we have witnessed
over the last two and a half years and which gave a friend on the
other side some false hopes have been given a fitting burial 
And the subsequent event has started getting results 
The prime minister's recent visit to Germany and
about the Switzerland was a resounding success 
With the brightening up of the investment climate in our
country offers for economic tie-up are pouring in faster than never
before 
The government on its part has made it a two words 
 but the changes under way do not and will not tinkle with the
basic postulates of a mixed economy and that none in the country 
would be adversely affected thereby noise 
Fears and strength on behalf of the workers a few
words two words seem to be only stimulated for
critical purposes 
All ventures are rather intended to create greater 
opportunities for the people to improve their living conditions 
Sir a natural outcome of the sober and mature leadership
provided to the country by Shri P V Narasimha Rao has dealt that our
stock has risen in the international community 
A position that Kashmir is an integral part of India is
once again appreciated by a very large number of countries and 
Pakistans' efforts to rake up the matter in the international meet
 have been tactfully one word and defeaed 
So the president has unequivocally expressed the feeling of
the issue as also a determination to safeguard the integrity of
the nation and our preparedness to meet two words 
When we take over we at the same time do wish to express a
feeling of most cordial relations with the people of Pakistan with
whom we have much in common 
We hold our ground firmly on issues like Kashmir non-
proliferation treaty as a need to face the United Nation Security
Council 
Terrorism and tenets of the factionalism has been met
remarkably in Punjab and the government is determined to fight it
 resolutely in any part of the country 
Donning the robes of a prosecutor Shri Jaswant Singhji
 charged the government and he was uncredible using the word charge
again and again sir 
He charged the government for not raising Hazrat Bal shrine so
that the tact and patience with which the government dealt with the
issue has been applauded all over the world 
And who can deny the perceptible improvement in the situation
thereafter 
Sir but it causes agony to our friend there because it has
deprived them of an opportunity to bake the political cake
 on the fire of communal frenzy 
Sir we have today charted a boat which would intends
to take India to the forefront of international community 
And our confidence our faith in doing so eminent from our
 one word to change with continuity 
We are proud of our past and have duplicit faith in the future
We believe in honouring difference of opinion 
We believe that national issues should be addressed to
 in a spirit of understanding and co-operation 
Sir if it is narrow political considerations which
dominate our thinking on every score I am afraid certain goals which
we wish to achieve may not become unachievable but our struggle
in achieving those would become a little adverse one and if it becomes
adverse the government headed by Shri Narasimha Raoji
 would remain undeterred 
He would remain unflinching in his determination to achieve
those goals 
 A few words 
Indrajit Gupta 
We were discussing the budget just now 
With the great uh uh incentives which have been provided
by the finance minister for the uh unrestricted growth of of the
private sector both domestic private sector as well as foreign investors
I am afraid this growth of black money will be further
accelerated leading to more and more corruption 
This is a sort of encouragement to what we should call financial
criminality 
Corruption is too mild term 
In some countries it is referred to it as financial criminality 
That is what is being fostered now in our country 
The President's address madam has consciously 
consciously or unconsciously I don't know whoever prepared the address 
obviously did it consciously has blacked out all reference to this
 spreading cancer and has given no indication of the type of people
who are indulging or who are in the position to indulge in this kind
of financial criminality 
So on the twenty-nineth of January a front page news item
 has appeared in one of our leading dailies namely The
Statesman 
Giving a list of forty-two people belonging to different
parties who are alleged to have been funded 
I the same people the same group of people who had uh
 been used by the ISI to fund the 
Hizbul Mujahideen and the accused in the Bombay Bomblasts
I don't know what is the political connection I can't uh 
easily find it out 
But anyway this is a case there in the Supreme Court now
pending 
Their names are given in this news item along with the amounts
of money which they are alleged to have received 
Among that uh major number of people come from the
 Congress party than uh from also from the
 BJP also from the Janata Dal 
 also from the Janata Dal Samajwadi fewer fewer
 the bulk of the names are from the Congress party 
Sir these are all honourable gentlemen 
Most of them are members of parliament some have been ministers
some are presently minister and uh I think that a paper which 
publishes this kind of serious type of allegation should either be
proceeded against by way of defamation proceedings in the court which has
not been done 
Or atleast the people who are named among these forty-two 
should have come out publicly with some denial or some contradiction 
which has not been done 
I neither know whether this allegations are correct or can be
correct or not 
But what is surprising me is you see a news report like this 
had created quite a lot of uh sensation and pendomonium among the
public who read these papers 
But no contradictions denials or defamation case or anything is
coming 
So this is very curious it seems to me 
And I want to draw the attention to this house that the
honourable members concerned should really be more serious about this
and take uh whatever necessary action they feel they should take 
But nothing has been done 
So my point is interruption that these these
cases will go on multiplying 
Not because of any individuals proclamities because of what I
said there is a economic and social forces are operating 
Black money is at the root of it and black money is leading to
proliferation of this type of corruption 
And the more that spreads people are thinking that well so many
people two words whether MPs or ministers or anybody else
 must have got also got something to do with this corruption
Is that good for the future of our country ?
So I am saying that this is a matter which everybody should
take seriously 
The President's address doesn't say anything about
these things
It doesn't say anything
It doesn't even mention a big event which took place in 
last year in ninety-three a very big event which was the scam
 the banking scam 
Is it just a small trivial matter ?
Is there no mention about it ?
You could say that such a thing happened we set-up a joint
parliamentary committee the joint parliamentry committee two words
 do it they have uh submitted their report and the uh prime
minister has assured parliament that a follow up action will be taken
against people who are guilty and all that 
There is no mention of the fact that eight thousand 
crores or may be more twelve thousand crores 
some people say 
The Bofors is chicken feed compare to this 
Bofors was only some sixty sixty-five crores 
Eight thousand to twelve thousand crores 
which was public's money deposited in the banks 
Why do public put money in the banks ?
Because they believe that it is in safe custody when it is in the
banks 
In small people also pensioners small people put money in the
banks 
But if thousands of crores of rupees
 you see is goes away from the back door the 
banks' one word virtue of a nexus between brokers 
bankers the businessmen and so many types of people who are in nexus
with each other
That money is funnelled out siphoned out from the bank 
In order to go and put money in the hands of these
speculators on the stock market stock exchange 
Is it a small matter ?
Such a thing never happened in our country before and it 
 is has affected mainly the public sector banking
system 
The nationalised banks about which Indira Gandhi has spoken
at the time of nationalisation that these are going to be the real
commanding heights of the economy 
Now what what is happening ?
So there is no mention in the President's 
address
So how can I thank him for this address I don't know which
completely avoids any mention of these things 
And what fate will other committees have ?
If the J P C is report is dealt with like this 
When the debate took place here in this house some people were
doing their best to denigrate such a report to dilute it and to say
which is not of much consequence 
So what will be the fate of other committees ?
What will be the fate of these uh uh standing committees
which are now operating which are also formed on an all-party basis 
What will happen to their reports and their recommends
 recommendations 
No body will bother about 
See it's part of our system isn't it ?
 It's part of our parliamentary system 
It all depends how you look at it how much you respect those
 institutions and how far you are prepared to carry out what they say
or not 
We are in a parliamentary form of government
If you want to have some other form of government of course it is
different matter 
But so long as this country has been commited to the parliamentary
democracy form of government multi-party system based on adult franchise 
so long you cannot escape what is called parliamentary accountability 
 Thats' the big biggest and only surviving super
power in the world today is deliberately trying to fish in troubled
waters in Kashmir and their spokesman have been coming out with so
many statements which are patently anti-Indian anti-Indian
sovereignity 
I believe Mr Chavan has said something quite was 
right about this yesterday
If I'm correct then I congratulate him for that 
And uh it would have been better if the President's
 address had also you see included something about this 
because I want to point out one thing it is not correct that will be wrong to
think that what they what the Americans are raking up is only a question
of human rights violation of human rights 
 That's only one aspect of it 
They are talking about a civil war they say civil war is
going on in Kashmir 
In his addressed address to the General
Assembly of the United Nations the President Clinton has said it that
conditions of civil war are developing in Kashmir 
Civil war is a term which has a specific meaning
