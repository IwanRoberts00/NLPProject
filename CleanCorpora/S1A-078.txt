The teaching of English in the schools is extremely faulty
True 
So can you identify the areas where basically the problem
lies with students of English in the schools ?
In in the area of pronunciation sir I have 
Uh is okay
Laid down on many problems that uh one is that 
they don't maintain the length of the vowels and they shift 
there is a phonemic alternation 
In place of one vowel they use uh the other vowel 
Like uh in uh while saying the word zero some of my
students say jero 
Some will say zero but the others will say jero 
So there is phonemic alternation 
Some will say amit but some will say omit some will
say oomit 
Some will say for example obedience obedience some
will say abedience obedience 
So faulty pronunciation I feel it it travels into
their uh uhm their whole career 
And uh from the very beginning we have got a faulty
pronunciation 
Ah now look at one thing my problem basically with
teacher of English is not so much phonemic 
I have a very serious doubt about the grammar
 the lack of really grammar which the students have
For instance even at the M Phil level I've come
across cases of students mixing up the tenses in the same sentence
I mean the present tense past tense and in one case
 I discovered all the three tenses used in a long sentence 
And I said you have left out nothing absolutely 
So that's one problem 
And I think much greater attention needs to be paid towards
 grounding 
I am not talking of I mean the traditional grammar but
atleast the modern approaches to grammar should atleast be given to
the students 
And what I find is probably this is a deficiency which
later on becomes incurable 
Because what you are trying doing to do 
is what you do at the the school level and what is going to be
confirmed at the undergraduate level is what will survive eventually at
the postgraduate level you see 
 Really 
 They use present and past and 
 Even 
 Basics of basics of English language is 
Sir don't you think they 
 So that is the structure 
Don't you think this deficiency lies some to some extent
 uh with the teachers 
Exactly
They cannot impart uh the good in a pro 
 Exactly exactly that of course is one part of it
That I mean it's like the blind leading the blind in many
cases I mean 
The students themse the teachers themselves are not aware
 of the rules of grammar they are themselves violating and
 naturally that is the violation they are passing on to the students
For instance I came across some books I mean written
for students I mean grammar I mean general English for students of B
A one and B A two by a group of professors of various colleges three
four of them joining hands writing 
And I discovered the essays which were written one is
ungrammatical English 
And I marked out certain portions in which there were howlers I
mean and I said if this is the essay the student is going to read and in
many cases commit to memory what sort of English is the student
eventually going to learn from there cough 
 I'll give just one example 
I forget which one are they but because some teachers gave and
gave me those copies I mean complimentary copies
And I said one word let me glance through it said
 aap ki bacchi bhi padthi hai so but my daughter was in B
A two or three at that time so she will be of in need of some of them 
So we are leaving these copies
Alright but let me go through them and let me see are they in the
right sort of English
And I discovered and I infact told one of them sir you
are an M Phil and is this the sort of English you your 
yourself writing 
What better English will the students write if this is the sort of
 ungrammatical English you are writing 
So this is the basic fault
I find two basic problems with students who come to my
department for instance one is the grammar lack of grammar
The second is lack of I mean what I would say vocabulary
Vocabulary is sometime so deficient that if I try to convey
something I have to look through these basic English virtually at time
 cough 
Is that your Michael West I made use of yes at two
different stages 
One when I was editing a play of Shakespeare for students 
Secondly when I was teaching at a place which is in a very 
backward area of Punjab Bhatinda 
So there people told me that here in English people are very
very deficient and they use a Hindi terms for it angrezi mei
haath bada tang hai 
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 Haan haan 
So I mean I said
Typical Punjabi 
 Ah yes yes 
And they said Saxena saab you'll have to
teach English for a change in Hindi and Punjabi 
I said at the master's level you expect uh there
is no help for it you will find it impossible to convey anything to them
I said don't worry I will not come down to Hindi or
Punjabi 
 I'll teach them in English of course I'll 
have to be very careful in the choice of words that I am going to use
 
And that was the second time I made use of the Service List of
Michael West 
And what I did is gradually I would introduce everyday 
of course it it involved lot of labour seven
or eight new words 
And that was also graded I mean these are the words
 I'm introducing today these are words I am introducing tomorrow 
And my effort was an every month it should be around
two hundred words I should be able to increase in their vocabulary 
And I discovered their vocabulary was almost doubled by the
time they completed the first session I did it you see 
And naturally they would understand English better 
So what I find is that these are the two basic deficiencies 
Phonetics is yes it is deficiency 
But phonetics does not pose such a major problem
You know why ? cough 
Because perhaps you have read also that there is now a
consensus I mean atleast that English can be pronounced slightly
differently in different parts of the world I mean 
I mean Australians pronounced it differently 
Canadian pronounce it differently America pronounce it
differently 
English that is to say the Queen's or the King's 
English is differently pronounced 
But then even in England there is variation in pronunciation
 It is being 
 America 
Regional variation 
Regional variations that fairly wide regional variations I
mean even in England 
So that's what I find
Phonetics is important in it's own way but that's
 not the be all and end all of teaching of English mind you 
What is more significant for the students is teaching of elementary
rules of grammar 
And what I find is there is a very small book I came across
published by Times London at two words 
The name of that book is in fact that's a series of books
maybe Pushpinder I sho sho showed you those books I mean 
 A grammar in sixty minutes that's the
title of that book I mean grammar in sixty minutes 
We have one or two such titles in our department I think they got
them from there 
Now maybe not in sixty minutes but that book of grammar
which gives the essential rules of grammar can be inculcated in the
students in about a month's time 
And even that would be in a series 
So that's what I found out
Yes
I don't know whether you came across that book 
But I keep on hunting for it not at my I am basically not
concerned with teaching of language 
But I am concerned of course with correctness of language 
So it's in that context I hunted out those books in
Delhi 
Maybe it could be some information for you also 
 Laughs 
So it's something about the vocabulary why don't
you elaborate ?
Means as far as your student is concerned or your
teachers are concerned ?
 Sir two words 
Vocabulary true it's it lacks people lack
vocabulary 
And uh sometimes even students they know the answer
sometimes but they don't find words to express themselves 
And uh of course teachers help them and we are
 even even if
 word in Hindi 
He he talks about dictionary 
Yeah 
 That's uh 
The dictionary habit
 One word 
And that is what students seriously lack I tell you
For vocabulary
They have to be made to look up the dictionary and that
should be the habit with I mean I one word that my
student 
 Every child should have
If you are ten percent doubt consult the
dictionary 
Don't presume this is the meaning because what you presume is
 it's normally wrong
 One word dictionary with him 
Normally wrong 
Go to a dictionary and what I normally tell the students
is have a big dictionary on your desk
A desk dictionary whether it is C O D or whether you've
 Chambers depends on whether you know phonetics or you don't know
phonetics one of these two 
But keep a small dictionary always in your pocket in the case
of girls they can in their 
Yeah purse 
 I mean purses I mean a small one whether it
is Little Oxford Dictionary yeah or Collin's Gem
Dictionary because the problem with students many times is they are
lazy
They would not like to go from one place to the other to lift
the dictionary 
That is the hassel they won't like to do 
If it is right in their pocket then perhaps they will
bring it out 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 But if they have if they have 
it in their bags they will just take it out and find 
 Yes it will become easier for them to consult
at time 
 That's what I have been telling my students again
and again 
 I always encourage them to bring
dictionaries cough everyday 
Another book
And uh 
Which I would mention and I may be it's of some
use to you that is Elements of Style by
Strung and White 
Have you seen it ?
We have six copies in our departmental department
 in the main library
And I find it has hardly been issued for so many years
You see that's of course an older edition
I have a new edition revised edition because the original was
written by Professor Strung it has been revised by E D White 
You see that's not in paper back also 
But paper back is also quite costly 
But what I suggest is atleast the teachers who are
interested can consult them Elements of Style
 
 Elements of Style 
You know why because Fowler is formidable in
 it's length 
Not everybody likes to consult or read it 
But that Element of Style is just
ninety-eight pages 
I mean not very difficult to simplify it 
And I find I gave it some of my M Phil students who had
problems with usage and all that and they said it has been useful 
And interestingly I discovered Pushpinder I was reading a
column in this uh Times of India Sunday and
it there was an article by Nissim Ezekiel who said he was using this very
book for his M A students Elements of Style I
mean that's what happened before this Nissim
retired last year from uh that Bombay University so it is very good
for his students 
 Yeah 
 A By just a matter of chance I
discovered in that article that I mean the same thing I have been using also
 for my students 
I think you tell the professor about your plans for
further work or 
Yeah 
About your teaching 
Teaching is more or less over you can talk of what are your
plans for further work research if you are doing or publishing or
anything else 
Sir I'll think of publishing it and revise it
 and uh put in all your suggestions that quantitative analysis of
the data I'll take up and I'll get it published
You know the problem is many students in fact I would
say majority of students once they have got their Ph D I mean and
they think well
They go and sleep laughs 
We have reached the destination laughs nothing
more is I mean we have got our degree
We can write doctor with our name and that's the end of
it
It happened with one of my scholar though 
It was my first research one word he was a school teacher
also 
When he came I said what exactly is your provocation
for registering for the Ph D I said do you think you
stand to get anything by getting a Ph D in English 
He gave a very curious reply to me 
He said sir when my daughter gets married I want
to issue the card which carries my name as doctor laughter
 the reason for it haan
