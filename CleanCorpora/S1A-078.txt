The teaching of English in the schools  is extremely faulty
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
lies with students of English in the schools  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Like uh  some of my
""
""
Some will say zero 
""
""
""
""
say oomit 
""
""
will say abedience 
""
""
their uh 
""
""
pronunciation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For instance  come
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
And I think  much greater attention needs to be paid towards
""
""
I am not talking of  I mean the traditional grammar but
""
""
""
And what I find is  which
""
""
Because what you are trying 
""
confirmed at the undergraduate level  is what will survive eventually at
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
cases I mean 
""
The students  the teachers themselves are not aware
""
 naturally that is the violation they are passing on to the students
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
eventually going to learn from there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
right sort of English
""
And I discovered and I infact told one of them  sir you
""
yourself writing 
""
""
""
""
So this is the basic fault
""
I find  who come to my
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
different stages 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
haath bada tang hai 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Punjabi 
""
""
have to be very careful in the choice of words  that I am going to use
""
""
""
""
""
And what I did is 
of course  seven
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I discovered  their vocabulary was almost doubled by the
""
""
And naturally they would understand English better 
""
So what I find is that these are the two basic deficiencies 
""
""
""
""
""
You know why 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
differently 
""
English that is to say the 
English 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Regional variations that fairly wide regional variations I
""
""
""
""
Phonetics is important in  that's
""
""
""
""
""
""
published by 
""
""
""
""
""
title of that book I mean 
""
We have one or two such titles in our department I think they got
them from there 
""
Now  but that book of grammar
""
students in about a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
concerned with teaching of language 
""
But I am concerned 
""
""
Delhi 
""
Maybe it could be some information for you also 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
teachers are concerned  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
vocabulary 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And that is what students seriously lack  I tell you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 should have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Go to a dictionary  and what I normally tell the students
""
""
""
 whether you know phonetics or you don't know
""
""
""
of girls they can in their 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
is Little Oxford Dictionary  Gem
""
lazy
""
""
the dictionary 
""
""
""
""
bring it out 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it in their bags they will 
""
""
""
at time 
""
 again
""
""
""
""
dictionaries 
""
""
Another book
""
""
""
""
""
""
use to you  by
""
""
""
""
""
 in the main library
""
""
""
""
""
""
I have a new edition revised edition  because the original was
""
""
You see 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not everybody likes to consult or read it 
""
But that  is just
""
""
I mean 
""
""
problems with usage and all that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think you tell the professor about your  plans for
further work or 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
plans for further  or publishing or
anything else 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
more is I mean we have got our degree
""
""
it
""
""
""
It was my first research  he was a school teacher
""
""
When he came  what exactly is your provocation
for registering for the Ph D  do you think you
""
""
""
""
""
to issue the card which carries my name as doctor  laughter
