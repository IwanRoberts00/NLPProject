The teaching of English in the schools  is extremely faulty
""
""
""
True 
""
""
So can you identify the areas  where basically the problem
lies with students of English in the schools  ?
""
""
In 
""
""
Uh  is okay
""
""
Laid down on many problems 
they don't maintain the length of the vowels 
there is a phonemic alternation 
""
In place of one vowel 
""
Like uh  some of my
students say jero 
""
Some will say zero 
""
So there is phonemic alternation 
""
Some will say  some will
say oomit 
""
Some will say  some
will say abedience 
""
So  it travels into
their uh 
""
And uh  from the very beginning we have got a faulty
pronunciation 
""
""
Ah now look at one thing  basically with
teacher of English is 
""
I have  the grammar
 grammar which the students have
""
For instance  come
across cases of students mixing up the tenses  in the same sentence
""
I mean  tense past tense and in one case
""
""
And I said you have left out nothing 
""
So 
""
And I think  much greater attention needs to be paid towards
""
""
I am not talking of  I mean the traditional grammar but
atleast  the modern approaches to grammar should atleast be given to
the students 
""
And what I find is  which
later on becomes incurable 
""
Because what you are trying 
is  and what is going to be
confirmed at the undergraduate level  is what will survive eventually at
the postgraduate level 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir 
""
""
""
""
""
Don't you think this deficiency lies some  to some extent
""
""
""
Exactly
""
""
They cannot 
""
""
 is one part of it
""
""
That I mean  like the blind leading the blind in many
cases I mean 
""
The students  the teachers themselves are not aware
 and
 naturally that is the violation they are passing on to the students
""
For instance  written
for students I mean  general English for students of B
A one and B A two  group of professors of various colleges three
four of them joining hands writing 
""
And I discovered  the essays which were written one is
ungrammatical English 
""
And I marked out certain portions  in which there were howlers I
mean and I said if this is the essay the student is going to read  and in
many cases commit to memory  what sort of English is the student
eventually going to learn from there 
""
""
""
I forget which one are they but because some teachers gave  and
gave me  those copies I mean complimentary copies
""
And I said  said
 B
A two or three at that time 
""
So we are leaving these copies
""
Alright but let me go through them and let me see are they in the
right sort of English
""
And I discovered and I infact told one of them  sir you
are an M Phil 
yourself writing 
""
What better English will the students write if this is the sort of
""
""
So this is the basic fault
""
I find  who come to my
department for instance one is  lack of grammar
""
The second is  I mean what I would say vocabulary
""
""
Vocabulary is sometime so deficient  that if I try to convey
something  I have to look through these basic English virtually at time
""
""
Is that your Michael West I made use of  at two
different stages 
""
One when I was editing a play of Shakespeare 
""
Secondly when I was teaching at a place 
backward area of Punjab 
""
So there people told me that here  in English people are very
very deficient and they use a Hindi terms for it  angrezi mei
haath bada tang hai 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  I mean I said
""
""
Typical 
""
""
""
""
And they said Saxena  have to
teach English for a change in Hindi and Punjabi 
""
I said at the  there
is no help for it you will find it impossible  to convey anything to them
""
""
I said  I will not come down to Hindi or
Punjabi 
""
""
have to be very careful in the choice of words  that I am going to use
""
""
And that was the second time I made use of the Service List of
Michael West 
""
And what I did is 
of course  seven
or eight new words 
""
And that was also  these are the words
""
""
And my effort was  it should be around
two hundred words I should be able to increase in their vocabulary 
""
And I discovered  their vocabulary was almost doubled by the
time 
""
And naturally they would understand English better 
""
So what I find is that these are the two basic deficiencies 
""
Phonetics 
""
But phonetics does not pose such a major problem
""
You know why 
""
Because perhaps you have read also that there is now  a
consensus I mean atleast  slightly
differently in different parts of the world I mean 
""
I mean Australians 
Canadian  America pronounce it
differently 
""
English that is to say the 
English 
""
But then even in England  there is variation in pronunciation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Regional variation 
""
""
Regional variations that fairly wide regional variations I
mean 
""
So  what I find
""
Phonetics is important in  that's
""
""
What is more significant for the students is teaching of elementary
rules of grammar 
""
And what I find is  there is a very small book I came across
published by 
""
""
The name of that book is in fact  a series of books
maybe Pushpinder I 
 the
title of that book I mean 
""
We have one or two such titles in our department I think they got
them from there 
""
Now  but that book of grammar
which gives the essential rules of grammar  inculcated in the
students in about a 
""
And even that would be in a series 
""
So  what I found out
""
""
Yes
""
""
I don't know whether you came across that book 
""
But I keep on hunting for it  I am basically not
concerned with teaching of language 
""
But I am concerned 
""
So  hunted out those books in
Delhi 
""
Maybe it could be some information for you also 
""
""
""
""
""
So  vocabulary why don't
you elaborate  ?
""
Means as far as  is concerned or your
teachers are concerned  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Vocabulary true  people lack
vocabulary 
""
And uh  the answer
sometimes 
""
And uh  we are
 if
""
""
""
""
""
He he talks about dictionary 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
The dictionary habit
""
""
""
""
""
And that is what students seriously lack  I tell you
""
""
For vocabulary
""
""
They have to be made to look up the dictionary  and that
should be the habit  my
student 
""
""
 should have
""
""
If you are ten percent  the
dictionary 
""
Don't presume this is the meaning  because what you presume is
 normally wrong
""
""
""
""
""
Normally wrong 
""
""
Go to a dictionary  and what I normally tell the students
is  on your desk
""
A desk dictionary whether it is C O D  you've
 whether you know phonetics or you don't know
phonetics one of these two 
""
But keep a small dictionary always in your pocket  in the case
of girls they can in their 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 a small one whether it
is Little Oxford Dictionary  Gem
Dictionary because  they are
lazy
""
They would not like to  go from one place to the other to lift
the dictionary 
""
That is the hassel they won't like 
""
If it is  right in their pocket then perhaps they will
bring it out 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it in their bags they will 
""
""
 easier for them to consult
at time 
""
 again
and again 
""
""
 bring
dictionaries 
""
""
Another book
""
""
And uh 
""
""
Which I would mention and I  of some
use to you  by
Strung and White 
""
Have you seen it  ?
""
We have six copies in our  department
 in the main library
""
And I find  for so many years
""
""
You see  of course an older edition
""
I have a new edition revised edition  because the original was
written by Professor Strung 
""
You see 
""
But paper back is also quite costly 
""
But what I suggest is  who are
interested  Elements of Style
""
""
""
""
""
""
You know why  formidable in
""
""
Not everybody likes to consult or read it 
""
But that  is just
ninety-eight pages 
""
I mean 
""
And I find  who had
problems with usage and all that 
""
And interestingly I discovered Pushpinder  I was reading a
column in  and
it there was an article by Nissim Ezekiel who said he was using this  very
book  I
mean  this Nissim
retired last year from  so it is very good
for his students 
""
""
""
""
""
 just a matter of chance I
discovered in that article that I mean the same thing I have been using also
""
""
""
I think you tell the professor about your  plans for
further work or 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
About your teaching 
""
Teaching is more or less over you can talk of  what are your
plans for further  or publishing or
anything else 
""
""
Sir  and revise it
 that quantitative analysis of
the data  get it published
""
""
""
You know the problem is  many students in fact I would
say majority of students  I mean and
they think well
""
""
They go and sleep 
""
""
We have reached the destination  nothing
more is I mean we have got our degree
""
We can write doctor with our name and  the end of
it
""
It happened with one of my scholar though 
""
It was my first research  he was a school teacher
also 
""
When he came  what exactly is your provocation
for registering for the Ph D  do you think you
stand to get anything by getting a Ph D in English 
""
He gave a very curious reply to me 
""
He said  I want
to issue the card which carries my name as doctor  laughter
