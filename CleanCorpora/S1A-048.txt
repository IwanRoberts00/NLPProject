Hi

So what are we talking about 
""
""
 how do
you pronounce your name 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  my name is not pronounced Alma
""
It is Elma 
""
""
Alma 
""
""
Elma 
""
""
What is it the  Malyalam way of
pronouncing 
""
""
 English name
""
""
It is 
""
""
It is and  it
means nourishing it means fostering 
""
""
How come most of this Keralites have name  English names
especially
""
""
Something like Shirley and Elma and  Mary
and all that
""
""
""
""
""
Mary is not uh English name you see

Surely English name  one
word 
""
 very ordinary name we make
""
""
""
""
""
It is something I heard for the first time Mary 
""
""
Mary
""
""
Yeah I mean it sounds more Christian  not exactly
""
""
Yeah I always used to
""
""
Not  only some chose the Christian
""

When I hear these names I think they are Anglo-Indian names

Some Christian name or something  then I have
to  you are not an Anglo-Indian
