The one who are uh born and brought up there know they are
rather conservative 
We get lot of ruffians here 
Yeah I know Bangalore I'm

Nothing of the sort 
You should see at the way they behave in buses and all that
 Alma

Yeah 
The only thing is that their hair is long

And you know no one can question a person about it 
why you are growing your hair 
He has put a pony he didn't put a shabby 
The problem is when you see them in the back you know
Yeah 
They will be wearing jeans even seniors wear jeans and
T-shirts and you can't make out the like that way know
