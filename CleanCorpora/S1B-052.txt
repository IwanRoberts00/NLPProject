Then now the discussion that we are having  really become
""
""
In the other house 
that is the ruling party has won 
""
Won means inspite of their  with their contrast
majority  was
unable to found hard 
""
I just have known that  be long to come
""
""
But let us take the fact 
""
It is because they are still there 
""
We have discussed their budget 
""
It is their budget 
""
It is not the budget of the country 
""
It is the budget of the Congress Party 
""
But 
party's 
""
Only one speaker 
talks on the 
finished their speech  and through the
Prime Minister 
""
In that  one or two words
 what is more
revealing  that
introspectable  that in this country for the last forty
years 
""
And now 
with the blessings  from the
region of Tirupathy or  at least in that stage
""
""
Today he is a  one or two
words 
""
This is certain thing that party is supposed to stand before 
for which that they  and from which they draw
sustenance 
""
From the name of Gandhiji  from the
name of Sardar Patel 
""
The Rajiv Gandhi of 
""
So within these 
this ninety-one period 
""
So all at  I don't know what will happen
at Amethi 
""
That is their internal affair 
""
But is  is the idealogical foundation of the
ruling party of the great country 
""
 unto the total population of the country
""
""
It is nice to break  almost by the
dual 
""
And now  even on which
""
""
Then the question is  we
should be thankful 
""
Either Dr Manmohan Singh or P V Narasimha Rao  if the budget
that has been presented 
""
That ensures  which we didn't
afford  or net loan
through other syndicates 
""
In the history of the world perhaps 
acknowledgement  of the building up of foriegn reserves and things like
that  what do we found
 ?
""
That these  went
""
""
one or two words 
""
And what else could he do  ?
""
He went 
""
Under the pressure of 
under the threat of this super three hundred one  regarding which some
""
""
In order  proposal
""
where Duncan proposals will be finalised 
""
What you mean then  ?
""
Our import duties had been reduced 
and services have been reduced  in order
to make 
""
To capture our market to victimise  our indigenous
industry 
""
Therefore  it may be looked into
 unequivocal
condemnation
""
I shall oppose 
""
V Narayanswamy 
""
""
Yes madam please
""
""
 honourable Finance Minister
""
""
 but he was not using
""
""
While referring to  birth situation on
the economic scenario  made very clear and categorical assertion in his
majesty 
enlight your  enlighten the honourable members who are on the other side
""
""
""
""
""
Madam  very rapidly
 at northern place and also more complicated
""
""
Other developing countries are successfully transforming themselves
""
""
We cannot afford afford to stay out of this problem which appear to
be awkward 
""
This 
""
Therefore madam the finance minister was very clear  in his mind
that with the 
changing 
""
Liberation is taking place 
and not only that  should become
competitive  in the field of production of various items including the
infrastructure industry  and India should be in a
position to export  various items
""
In the International field India also should become  competent
""
""
And also competitive  to
balance our economic situation 
""
Therefore madam several liberal liberal measures  for
 and which has
been taken by the present government 
""
But that is the  and steps that
has been taken by the government  for the purpose of recouping the economy
""
started 
""
 balance of
payments position 
""
eighty-eight thousand eight hundred to eight hundred twenty-eight 
crores 
""
""
On borrowed money 
""
""
No it is not borrowed money
""
The borrowed money goes to investment  which which one has to
accept 
""
Madam it is also a fact that  our
limit of five point 
we have not achieve
""
One has 
""
Therefore madam the government has taken 
for the purpose of improving the economy 
""
And the finance minister  to
bring reform 
""
Madam the thrust has been given for agriculture  in the in the
present budget by the finance minister 
""
And the outlay for the  agriculture
""
considerably 
""
The reason is that madam  the agriculture is the poor sector
 the vital for the purpose of development of any country
especially 
""
Madam then the government brought liberalisation as far as the 
the  the agro-based
industries 
""
The agriculture  and also
support 
""
Therefore madam that the name  that
has been proposed 
and the  to
come into this country in the rural areas 
employment to the rural persons who are living in this country 
""
Madam the industrial recession 
in this country 
""
And not only the industrial recession in this country  it has
been throughout the world 
""
The  both the consumer items and also the infrastructure
industries 
""
Even in the other country  there is
recession total recession  and therefore the goods could not be marketed
""
""
Therefore madam  some changes have been brought by this
government  and also especially in the
infrastructure side  boost to the infrastructure
industry 
""
Madam in the banking sector 
a few lines 
""
Uh the it is a 
""
Now  in
the security scam 
""
Several banks have been involved 
""
Several 
one or two words  and also some of the officers have been arrested
""
""
And C B I is  investigating into the
matter 
going into the security scam 
""
Madam though it was initially felt it is about five thousand 
two hundred 
""
Madam this  the
banking system in this country 
""
And that the banks  in
that say scam  without the approval of the government
""
""
And also  and thereby
the finance minister has to undertake  crores
 the
manufacturing bank 
""
Madam the honourable  minister for banking is also
sitting here 
""
Then who is affected today  ?
""
It is the farmer who is affected 
""
It is the farm industrial products who are affected  not the
 it is only the people
who are genuinely working for the development of this country  they are
affected 
""
And the 
""
Even madam see  when the previously when Congress government
there  there was a scheme for the purpose of giving loan to the people
loans 
""
And it was giving benefit to the 
and also schedule caste and schedule tribe people 
""
And 
""
Today what is happening  they are not in a position to go to the
bank 
""
The reason is that 
""
They have completely closed the door 
""
Thereafter  security scam after security
scam  they are not allowing the agriculturists
to enter into the bank 
""
This is a very serious matter Mr minister 
""
The Indira Gandhi our honourable former Prime Minister has taken up
 is only for the purpose of giving benefit
to the poor people  schedule caste and schedule tribe
agriculture 
""
And madam  method
""
""
In the banking division 
people there honestly repay the amount 
""
It is the big industrialist  who have siphoned out ten thousand
 who have not paid that
money 
""
But it is only the agriculturists who are paying the money  and
those people 
""
And not only that  small-scale
industrialists  the reason is that
the banks banks have completely closed down
""
They have not  allowed the small scale industries also to come
for the working capital 
""
They say  the security scam is being
investigated 
""
Therefore they will not give you the loan 
""
Therefore madam the production in the small-scale  sec
""
""
Madam small scale sector is contributing twenty-two percent of the
export in this conutry 
""
It is not the big industry it is not the  middle
industry  for
large export in this country that is going to be killed by the banking sector
""
""
Therefore the honourable  minister Venkatrajan minister who is
sitting here  call all the
""
""
Normal banking activity should start  otherwise our production
in this country 
""
And also the people who are in the agriculture sector they will be
suffering 
""
The another area there  honourable finance minister has to
concentrate 
""
More than eighty thousand 
rupees 
""
Madam that black money has to be brought down 
""
Which should be brought out which is now hidden 
""
That is to be done  then
they bringing fund from Madras  the government will not ask the account
""
""
Now where was scheme that we brought  ?
""
What is the total amount if you have  recovered if you have
brought out of it  ?
""
It is not even  out of eighty
thousand  not even seven percent of the money has come
out 
""
What is the scheme you have  ?
""
So that the inflation will not be there  and there will be a
balance economy  and and and the people and the budget which you have been
presenting in the 
""
Madam the  novel provision is for the
small scale industry  who'll
 and it is a
laudable measure that has been taken 
""
And madam in our state though it is small state  having more
than 
""
In in our  four
hundred small units  which
are to be sold one  and even a common man goes and
gets it and he is using it 
""
And there are madam  is working in
this country  for the simple reason that
these  see that these
industries are closed 
""
Madam the  government has taken a
decision  and the turnover
has been increased to 
""
It is a right decision has been taken by the government  on the
representation given by those people 
""
But madam the lobby that is working the multinational  who who
are in this country 
""
And madam that is giving in a small place it is giving employment
to more than 
""
The the people who are involved in the production  people who
are involved in the marketing  ten thousand people are getting the benefit
""
Not only that  a few words
""
""
Therefore madam  I feel that it is a growth
oriented budget
