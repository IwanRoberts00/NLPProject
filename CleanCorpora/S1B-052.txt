 Prof Sarin 
Then now the discussion that we are having really become
 ritually a few words 
In the other house already the budget has got through 
that is the ruling party has won 
Won means inspite of their minority with their contrast
majority only because the total of the opposition was
unable to found hard on that contrast majority to break it through 
I just have known that one or two words be long to come
But let us take the fact as they are kept at the moment 
It is because they are still there 
We have discussed their budget 
It is their budget 
It is not the budget of the country 
It is the budget of the Congress Party 
But the very truly I feel with that party is this 
party's culture spins us around personality cult 
Only one speaker whether I I can agree with him or not 
talks on the one or two words but all others have 
finished their speech with one or two words and through the
Prime Minister and Finance minister in the bracket 
In that one or two words with that of one or two words
 during the entire speech and I think what is more
revealing in this house such self-analysis that
introspectable vioable that in this country for the last forty
years we have been groping in the dark through a known path 
And now a doctor has appeared with a magic lantern 
with the blessings of the Prime Minister who hails from the
region of Tirupathy or one or two words at least in that stage
Today he is a one or two words self one or two
words 
This is certain thing that party is supposed to stand before 
for which that they one or two words and from which they draw
sustenance 
From the name of Gandhiji from the name of Nehru from the
name of Sardar Patel and all other freedom fighters 
The Rajiv Gandhi of of whom they will now talk so much 
So within these forty years forty or as in free 
this ninety-one period 
So all at one or two words I don't know what will happen
at Amethi 
That is their internal affair 
But is such bretheren is the idealogical foundation of the
ruling party of the great country 
 That's a woe unto the total population of the country
It is nice to break one or two words almost by the
dual one or two words it has no right 
And now by inheriting that if demolishing it even on which
 on the foundation on which they stand 
Then the question is Mr vice chairman what for we
should be thankful to the new mens era 
Either Dr Manmohan Singh or P V Narasimha Rao if the budget
that has been presented what is that what that ensure 
That ensures that our foriegn exchange which we didn't
afford I M F loan or World Bank loan or A G B loan or net loan
through other syndicates 
In the history of the world perhaps such shameless 
acknowledgement of the building up of foriegn reserves and things like
that and showing it to be a strength of the economy what do we found
 ?
That these and of late our finance minister went
 in the one pack jumborie in order to ensure three hundred 
 crores of dollor one or two words for what 
one or two words our all one or two words 
And what else could he do ?
He went a few words policy only involved that you know 
Under the pressure of U S A one or two words 
under the threat of this super three hundred one regarding which some
 a few words takes place now and then 
In order to one or two words the Duncan proposal
 in order to steal ourselves for that one or two words 
where Duncan proposals will be finalised 
What you mean then ?
Our import duties had been reduced one or two words 
and services have been reduced or totally done away with in order
to make import from advanced countries to developed countries 
To capture our market to victimise of our indigenous
industry 
Therefore from whatever point of view it may be looked into
 it enlarge unqualified proposition and unequivocal
condemnation
I shall oppose oppose this budget tooth and nail 
V Narayanswamy 
Yes madam please
 one or two words honourable Finance Minister
 A few words but he was not using
While referring to the present day birth situation on
the economic scenario made very clear and categorical assertion in his
majesty which I like to put only two or three sentences to 
enlight your enlighten the honourable members who are on the other side
 A few words 
Madam he says the a few words very rapidly
 becoming more integrated at northern place and also more complicated
Other developing countries are successfully transforming themselves
 to meet these challenges 
We cannot afford afford to stay out of this problem which appear to
be awkward 
This a few words 
Therefore madam the finance minister was very clear in his mind
that with the with the birth the economic situation is changing 
changing changing rapidly 
Liberation is taking place even in the communist country 
and not only that they one or two words should become
competitive in the field of production of various items including the
infrastructure industry consumer industry and India should be in a
position to export to other countries various items
In the International field India also should become competent
And also competitive to get not the foriegn exchange to
balance our economic situation 
Therefore madam several liberal liberal measures for
 to sort out on one or two words and which has
been taken by the present government for the last two years 
But that is the the the new schemes and steps that
has been taken by the government for the purpose of recouping the economy
 that was established in the year nineteen ninety-one beginning 
started yielding good results 
 Ma Madam the balance of
payments position which was left at two thousand crores 
 by the previous government now it has come up to the level of 
eighty-eight thousand eight hundred to eight hundred twenty-eight 
crores 
On borrowed money 
No it is not borrowed money
The borrowed money goes to investment which which one has to
accept 
Madam it is also a fact that the the our our
limit of five point nine million as our foriegn exchange reserve 
we have not achieve
One has I have to admit on that point and that aspect 
Therefore madam the government has taken various measures 
for the purpose of improving the economy 
And the finance minister who has taken a bold decision to
bring reform in in the in the agriculture side 
Madam the thrust has been given for agriculture in the in the
present budget by the finance minister 
And the outlay for the one or two words agriculture
 si side has been increased 
considerably 
The reason is that madam the agriculture is the poor sector
 which is the vital for the purpose of development of any country
especially our country India 
Madam then the government brought liberalisation as far as the 
the bringing the industries in the rural areas the agro-based
industries 
The agriculture to be given all the emphasis and also
support by the by the budget 
Therefore madam that the name new agriculture policy that
has been proposed by the government is going to give a thrust to it 
and the it will pay therefore lot of agro-based industries to
come into this country in the rural areas for the purpose of creating 
employment to the rural persons who are living in this country 
Madam the industrial recession was there in the last year 
in this country 
And not only the industrial recession in this country it has
been throughout the world 
The both the consumer items and also the infrastructure
industries the production was less 
Even in the other country but the there is
recession total recession and therefore the goods could not be marketed
 anywhere in our country and also abroad 
Therefore madam some changes have been brought by this
government for the purpose of investment and also especially in the
infrastructure side so that to give boost to the infrastructure
industry 
Madam in the banking sector which I would like to say only 
a few lines 
Uh the it is a one word the nation 
Now several lakhs of rupees have been in
the security scam 
Several banks have been involved 
Several the executives of the banks have been 
one or two words and also some of the officers have been arrested
And C B I is one or two words investigating into the
matter and not only that our parliamentary committee is also 
going into the security scam 
Madam though it was initially felt it is about five thousand 
two hundred crores 
Madam this this security scam has only shaken the the
banking system in this country 
And that the banks have indiscriminately invested in the in
that say scam one word without the approval of the government
And also bring the one or two words and thereby
the finance minister has to undertake ten thousand crores
 for the purpose of the giving the
manufacturing bank 
Madam the honourable the minister for banking is also
sitting here 
Then who is affected today ?
It is the farmer who is affected 
It is the farm industrial products who are affected not the
 one or two words not the stock brokers it is only the people
who are genuinely working for the development of this country they are
affected 
And the loan are loans are not being given to them 
Even madam see when the previously when Congress government
there there was a scheme for the purpose of giving loan to the people
loans one word scheme was there 
And it was giving benefit to the small people agriculturist 
and also schedule caste and schedule tribe people 
And and also from labourers 
Today what is happening they are not in a position to go to the
bank they are not able to enter into the bank today 
The reason is that that the B J P government came here 
They have completely closed the door 
Thereafter one or two words security scam after security
scam the banking officials they are not allowing the agriculturists
to enter into the bank 
This is a very serious matter Mr minister 
The Indira Gandhi our honourable former Prime Minister has taken up
 Nationalisation of the bank is only for the purpose of giving benefit
to the poor people downtrodden schedule caste and schedule tribe
agriculture a few words agriculturists 
And madam I feel there is a one or two words method
In the banking division we don't one or two words 
people there honestly repay the amount 
It is the big industrialist who have siphoned out ten thousand
 crores of rupees who have not paid that
money 
But it is only the agriculturists who are paying the money and
those people a few words 
And not only that for only capital small-scale
industrialists who are who are suffering today the reason is that
the banks banks have completely closed down
They have not allowed the small scale industries also to come
for the working capital 
They say one or two words the security scam is being
investigated they have not received any direction from the government 
Therefore they will not give you the loan 
Therefore madam the production in the small-scale sec
 sector is going down 
Madam small scale sector is contributing twenty-two percent of the
export in this conutry 
It is not the big industry it is not the middle middle
industry it is only small scale industry that is contributing for
large export in this country that is going to be killed by the banking sector
 because they are not providing loans to them 
Therefore the honourable minister Venkatrajan minister who is
sitting here I request him to deal with seriously call all the
 bank banking officers give a direction to them 
Normal banking activity should start otherwise our production
in this country will go down 
And also the people who are in the agriculture sector they will be
suffering 
The another area there honourable finance minister has to
concentrate is black money 
More than eighty thousand crores of 
rupees is in the form of black money interruption 
Madam that black money has to be brought down 
Which should be brought out which is now hidden 
That is to be done various schemes have been brought then
they bringing fund from Madras the government will not ask the account
Now where was scheme that we brought ?
What is the total amount if you have recovered if you have
brought out of it ?
It is not even more than seven percent out of eighty
thousand crores not even seven percent of the money has come
out 
What is the scheme you have to bring the black money out ?
So that the inflation will not be there and there will be a
balance economy and and and the people and the budget which you have been
presenting in the country is imperfect 
Madam the only madam the novel provision is for the
small scale industry especially the people who are who'll
 be having small industry have been given the benefit and it is a
laudable measure that has been taken 
And madam in our state though it is small state having more
than only ten lakh population 
In in our town limit alone we have more than four
hundred small units which are manufacturing one word which
are to be sold one rupee and even a common man goes and
gets it and he is using it 
And there are madam it's a big lobby is working in
this country to curtail that industry for the simple reason that
these giants and multinationals they are trying to see that these
industries are closed 
Madam the the one word government has taken a
decision low duty duty will be imposed on this item and the turnover
has been increased to thirty lakhs 
It is a right decision has been taken by the government on the
representation given by those people 
But madam the lobby that is working the multinational who who
are in this country they are trying to kill those industry 
And madam that is giving in a small place it is giving employment
to more than ten thousand people 
The the people who are involved in the production people who
are involved in the marketing ten thousand people are getting the benefit
Not only that the people who are using it are a few words
Therefore madam this budget I feel that it is a growth
oriented budget it is a common man's budget
