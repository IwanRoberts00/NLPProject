Now go to the  second
""
""
Second 
""
The second thesis is  Congress
Party and Peasant Movement in Maharashtra 
thirty to nineteen hundred and fifty 
""
Uh in this thesis  the
interaction between the Congress party and the different peasant movements
 to nineteen
fifty 
""
Uh there was a very close connection between the  growth of
Congress party  movements that were launched
by peasants 
""
So the peasants played  peasant leaders played a very important
role 
""
Uh the leaders of  joined Congress in
nineteen thirty 
""
In nineteen thirty-seven thirty-eight Keshav Rao Jede  become
the  became the President of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee
""
""
So there was a close interaction between the peasant leaders and
the Congress party 
""
And there was a conflict 
and uh Congress party bosses 
and Balasaheb Kher 
""
In this thesis 
first and second Kher ministry
""
The first 
under the leadership of Balasaheb Kher  from nineteen thirty-seven to
nineteen thirty-nine  uh
legislations  or
implementation of certain land reforms 
""
The second Kher ministry took over 
""
The performance of Kher ministry from nineteen forty-six to
nineteen fifty is also discussed 
""
During that period the Kher  Kher government has
passed this important  uh the land reforms
legislation that is land to the tiller 
""
And uh  there was a close competition between the rural congress
leader 
""
And because of that there was a conflict 
and Mr Keshav Rao Jede and because of that conflict ultimately  there was
a split in the congress party in nineteen forty-eight
""
And a  party was established
""
So all these things are discussed by  uh Mr Jadhav in his thesis
""
""
Now we can 
""
So R V 
""
""
One minute

""
""
""
""
""

His name was also excluded in that 
""

""
""
Uhn 
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
Congress party
""
""
Uhn Congress party  and Rajshekharaiah will be good for
 this theory
""
""
""
""
""
So then 
""
""
These three uh 
""
""
There addreses 
""
""
No 
""
The next 
""
One student has submitted synopsis for  one or two
""
""
Two students have 
""
""
 for the registration of
Ph D 
""
Now one is Dinkar Patil the other is 
""
Both the Patils again 
""
Uh now Patil  Dinkar Patil wants to do on political leadership
of  Vasantdada Patil special reference to his role as
chief minister of Maharashtra from seventy-seven to 
""
Now the guide is 
""
First one reserve it 
""
""
N R Patil 
""
""
N R Patil 
""
""
So it is forwarded by you  so that is why
you have signed
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn yes yes 
""
""
""
how far the guide has taken into consideration the various  done
""
""
Jamadar has submitted dissertation 
""
""
Uh previous works have been concentrated on uh  the
cooperative movement 
""
As a chief 
""
""
He wants he wants 
""
""
As a role of a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
But then you have 
included a chapter on  Vasant Dada Patil
""
""
""
""
""
Vasant  role in pre-independent period
nineteen seventeen to forty-six 
""
Vasant  political activity involvement in forty-six
to fifty-one
""
So this is all before becoming the chief minister 
""
Vasant  in nineteen fifty to
seventy-one 
""
Then comes 
""
""
That everybody know that he was a chief minister
""
""
Vasant 
""
""
""
That has to be done 
""
""
Chapter two Vasant 
chief minister 
""
That is alright 
""
Chapter three Vasant Dada  role as chief
minister
""
""
No the title concerned with  political leadership no
""
""
""
""
""
""
With special reference to chief  role
affair
""
""
But the content is 
""
""
Which also as a backdrop you want to  tell it as a
""
""
""
""
""
""
As a historical  background
""
""
""
""
""
In the introductory chapter 
""
""
Introductory chapter he should uh  he should
""
""
Vasant 
""
""
Introduction 
""
""
So all the chapters are 
Dada's  the
period that is 
dates have been given 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Seventy-seven to  five
""
""
Eighty-six eighty-five
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then the last chapter
""
""
You concentrate on that only  seventy-seven to eighty-five
""
""
Lot of materials are there
""
""
""
""
""
Ten years is enough 
""
""
Ten years is enough 
""
""
And if 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
We will record that also 
""
See the problem would 
language again  do in English or not
""
""
Then afterwards 
 asking that
all materials are kept in Marathi and so he would submit it in Marathi and
all 
""
""
Actually it is going to be very difficult 
most of the students are writing in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I think 
""
That he may be allowed for registration 
""
But the first chapter has to  we feel that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No no again how 
""
""
Look men  role
as pre-independence
""
You can just give a biography 
""
""
Finish 
""
""
Up to  sixth chapter is not
necessary
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Sixth chapter 
""
""
From seventy-seven to eighty-five 
""
""
Uhn you just put  the title
""
""
Instead of eighty-nine there should be eighty-five 
""
""
Political  Vasant Dada
Patil  with special reference to his role as a chief minister of
Maharashtra  seventy-seven to
""
""
Wait
""
""
Nineteen eighty-five 
""

""
""
""
""
The changes recommended 
""
Now what will be the changes recommended 
""

""
""
I think he has included in chapter one all those things 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Pre-independence to a period 
political activities 
""
His role other than as a chief minister 
""
""
Sir 
""
""

""
So I don't think there is a need of recommendation
""
""
No you change the 
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""

Uhm
""
""
The last two chapters 
""
""
Now we go to another synopsis which has been submitted by
""
""
N R Patil 
""
""
N R Patil on 
""
""
Hindustan Latex Limited 
a Government of India undertaking 
""
""
What exactly he wants to do  ?
""
Laxminarayan as a guide you better tell us 
""
""
Hindustan Latex 
""
""
""
One one synopsis 
""
If he reads 
""
""
Okay 
""
""
Tell us 
""
""
Hindustan Latex Limited 
""
If you read out 
""
""
""
with uh 
""
The title is 
District Belgaum  within its
parenthesis
""
A case study of the 
""
So the title indicates that the candidate is studying 
admitted to an organised outside of this undertaking  public undertaking
""
""
In his  in his synopsis he mentions that there were just five
""
twenty-nine  which has risen
to one hundred and eighty-six undertakings  with a total investment of
worth 
""
This indicates that public sector undertakings are getting
momentum in India 
""
But uh 
sector undertakings in the country some are 
""
Some are only dealing profit making 
""
And this actually this  this Hindustan Latex
Limited Kanagala was established by  Central Health and Family Welfare
ministry on March nineteen eighty-seven 
""
So till today it is hardly  eight or
less than that 
""
This factory is now producing condom  Mala-N
etcetra and transporting such goods to Madras  Bombay Calcutta Surat Delhi
""
""
Objective of the study  to study
the organisation in administrative problems of the Hindustan Latex Limited
Kanagala  it is very essential to understand this study from its
perspective of  growth of public sector undertakings in India in general
""
""
In this context  the study tries to understand the origin and
growth of this public sector with reference to the public undertakings in
India 
""
The major coordination  the personnel and
financial problem  as well as problems concerning labourers will be
studied 
""
It also studies the production capacity  cost of production and
transporting goods to outside the country as well as within 
is 
""
For this purpose 
""
It it says that the study based on empirical research 
""
The primary data will be collected by using photo  one word
""
""
And candidate also argue that he intend to use questionnaire and
interview technique for official  as well as the workers
""
""
To obtain as clear a view as possible we try to include the
Governmental 
cost and transportation in relative problems 
""
Minutes of the meetings will be used for the purpose of
understanding 
""
Apart from this primary data secondary data will be collected by
using annual report  journals periodicals and other published materials
relevant to the subject
""
So  data and matter are the subject undertaken by the
candidate
""
He feels that 
two words  Ph D
degree
""
And the continuous chapterisation given by the candidate one is
introduction  third is
administrative organisation  fifth is
personnel administration 
""
So it seems that the candidate wants to  comprehend the
organisation working of the 
certain broad areas  personnel
administration 
""
I think the candidate can  work in the
prescribed time limit
