 Under the and the first item on the agenda we have
 uh two submissions 
Now these two submissions are for the award of Ph D degree
Uh one is submitted by Shri S L Jadhav
Now he has submitted a dissertation on the 
Congress Party and the Peasant Movements in Maharashtra from nineteen thirty
to nineteen fifty 
And the other dissertation has which has 
 been submitted that is by S D Pawar on Social and
Political Thought of Acharya Jawadekar 
Now we have to appoint referees as far as the 
external referees are concerned 
Uh I'd like uh the guide of the research Dr S
Chousalkar to just shed some light on the work done and uh 
then we'll discuss the excerpts 
Then we may appoint the three three experts on each of these
 dissertation
I think six of the 
Six six six experts on each of the dissertations 
And as the rule goes the names will be submitted to 
the Vice-chancellor and the Vice-chancellor will prepare a list 
of the preferences to whom they will be referred 
Now I shall I request Dr Chousalkar to just throw some
light on the work done by his two students 
Sir two synopses submitted the first is by Mr S D
Pawar on Social and Political Thought of Acharya Jawadekar
 
In his thesis he has studied uh social and political thought of
Acharya Jawadekar uh to historical perspective 
And in his thesis he has tried to throw light on contributions
that are made by Acharya Jawadekar 
Uh as far as understanding modern Indian political uh history
is concerned as far understanding socialism is concerned as far as uh
understanding of uh democracy is concerned 
So and he has expounded his own concept of satyagraha
 in socialism 
So Acharya Jawadekar's contribution uh to political
science is uh discussed in this book in this thesis
And I think uh uh persons who are specialised in this
subject should be appointed 
So we have to recommend six names sir

Now go to the second
Second 
The second thesis is uh related to the Congress
Party and Peasant Movement in Maharashtra from nineteen hundred and 
thirty to nineteen hundred and fifty 
Uh in this thesis Mr Jadhav has studied the
interaction between the Congress party and the different peasant movements
 that were launched in Maharashtra from nineteen thirty to nineteen
fifty 
Uh there was a very close connection between the growth of
Congress party and different political movements that were launched
by peasants 
So the peasants played peasant leaders played a very important
role important in Maharashtra after nineteen thirty 
Uh the leaders of Bahujan Samaj joined Congress in
nineteen thirty 
In nineteen thirty-seven thirty-eight Keshav Rao Jede become
the became the President of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee
So there was a close interaction between the peasant leaders and
the Congress party 
And there was a conflict between the peasant leaders 
and uh Congress party bosses like Shankar Rao Dev Vallabh Bhai Patel 
and Balasaheb Kher 
In this thesis uh Mr Jadhav discusses the performance of 
first and second Kher ministry
The first ministry was formed in nineteen thirty-seven 
under the leadership of Balasaheb Kher from nineteen thirty-seven to
nineteen thirty-nine the Kher ministry uh passed many uh
legislations regarding the abolition of rural indebtedness or
implementation of certain land reforms 
The second Kher ministry took over in nineteen forty-six 
The performance of Kher ministry from nineteen forty-six to
nineteen fifty is also discussed 
During that period the Kher minis Kher government has
passed this important uh the legislation that uh the land reforms
legislation that is land to the tiller 
And uh there was a close competition between the rural congress
leader and the congress bosses 
And because of that there was a conflict between Mr Kher 
and Mr Keshav Rao Jede and because of that conflict ultimately there was
a split in the congress party in nineteen forty-eight
And a Shetkari Kamgar party was established
So all these things are discussed by uh Mr Jadhav in his thesis
Now we can recommend certain names as related to

So then another 
These three uh 
There addreses we'll have to bring 
No one word no problem no problem 
The next uh thing is that this one 
One student has submitted synopsis for one or two
Two students have submitted 
 Submitted synopsis for the registration of
Ph D 
Now one is Dinkar Patil the other is N R Patil 
Both the Patils again 
Uh now Patil Dinkar Patil wants to do on political leadership
of Shri Vasantdada Patil special reference to his role as
chief minister of Maharashtra from seventy-seven to eighty-nine 
Now the guide is guidance of Rasam madam uhm 
First one reserve it 
N R Patil 
N R Patil one word 
So it is forwarded by you uhm so that is why
you have signed
 Uhm 
Uhn yes yes laughs 
 One word we have to know whether 
how far the guide has taken into consideration the various works done
Jamadar has submitted dissertation 
Uh previous works have been concentrated on uh the
cooperative movement not on Vasant Dada Patil 
As a chief minister's work has not been done 
He wants he wants to purely concentrate on 
As a role of a chief minister 
 As of chief minister accha 
But then you have but that I think he uh 
included a chapter on Vasant Dada Patil
 But that 
Vasant Dada's role in pre-independent period
nineteen seventeen to forty-six 
Vasant Dada's political activity involvement in forty-six
to fifty-one
So this is all before becoming the chief minister 
Vasant Dada's role as an M L A in nineteen fifty to
seventy-one 
Then comes that is 
That everybody know that he was a chief minister
Vasant Dada's role as an immigration 
 irrigation minister 
That has to be done 
Chapter two Vasant Dada's Patil uh role as 
chief minister 
That is alright 
Chapter three Vasant Dada Patil's role as chief
minister
No the title concerned with political leadership no
 
 That is in consideration 
With special reference to chief minister's role
affair
But the content is 
Which also as a backdrop you want to tell it as a
 Want to pass 
As a historical background background
 Background 
In the introductory chapter 
Introductory chapter he should uh he should
Vasant Dada's 
Introduction 
So all the chapters are or based on Vasant 
Dada's Patil role as chief minister and the
period that is different periods are given specific 
dates have been given actually 
 Chief minister 
 Different periods 
Seventy-seven to eighty five
Eighty-six eighty-five
 Eighty-five 
 Eighty-five 
Then the last chapter
You concentrate on that only seventy-seven to eighty-five
Lot of materials are there
 Haan 
Ten years is enough 
Ten years is enough 
And if and if if chief as chief minister 
Yes 
We will record that also 
See the problem would you have be 
language again whether you will be able to do in English or not
 laughs 
Then afterwards you may again sub require to 
 submit a an application asking that
all materials are kept in Marathi and so he would submit it in Marathi and
all 
Actually it is going to be very difficult uhn 
most of the students are writing in Marathi 
 Uhn 
 Marathi 
So I think tentatively in principle we accept it 
That he may be allowed for registration uhm 
But the first chapter has to undergo as we feel that
 Uhm 
 We'll put it in the introductory part 
No no again how one or two words 
Look men don't even mention Vasant Dada's role
as pre-independence
You can just give a biography 
Finish 
Up to uh this one word sixth chapter is not
necessary
Uhm 
Sixth chapter 
From seventy-seven to eighty-five 
Uhn you just put the title
Instead of eighty-nine there should be eighty-five 
Political leadership of Shri Vasant Dada
Patil with special reference to his role as a chief minister of
Maharashtra from seventy-seven to
Wait
Nineteen eighty-five 
Nineteen eighty-five and uh
There are only uh there are breaks
 It's alright 
But then the changed synopsis making certain changes in
chapter one 
To this we'll have the P G section to write to
him accordingly
Yeah 
 We'll refer to the synopsis again 
The changes recommended 
Now what will be the changes recommended 
Changes that is from period from seventy nineteen
seventy-seven to
Eighty-five 
I think he has included in chapter one all those things 
 no which you recommended 
 No 
Pre-independence to a period Vasant Dada's 
political activities and involvement in nineteen forty-six 
His role other than as a chief minister 
Sir we'll conclude 
 Everything has been included in the
introduction 
So I don't think there is a need of recommendation
No you change the this 
 We'll change only the last chapter 
Say introduction
Delete the last chapter 
No let the chapter one be there 
Let it be Vasant Dada a biography itself 
Uh bio 
Biographical profile
Profile
Profile
And you want them to include but don't mention these 
subtitles
Uhn 
Historical Biography whatever it might be 
Biographical 
Biographical profile
Profile haan 
Uhm
The last two chapters ommited 
Now we go to another synopsis which has been submitted by
N R Patil 
N R Patil on 
Hindustan Latex Limited Kanagala District Belgaum 
a Government of India undertaking a case study of one word 
What exactly he wants to do ?
Laxminarayan as a guide you better tell us 
Hindustan Latex Limited is a 
 If you write out 
One one synopsis 
If he reads I will write it out later on don't worry 
Okay 
Tell us 
Hindustan Latex Limited 
If you read out 
 I'll read out the synopsis of the student 
with uh some omissions and commissions 
The title is Hindustan Latex Limited Kanagala 
District Belgaum a Government of India undertaking within its
parenthesis
A case study of the one word organisation is working 
So the title indicates that the candidate is studying 
admitted to an organised outside of this undertaking public undertaking
In his in his synopsis he mentions that there were just five
 public undertakings with a total investment of rupees 
twenty-nine crores in nineteen fifty-one which has risen
to one hundred and eighty-six undertakings with a total investment of
worth twenty thousand crores by nineteen eighty 
This indicates that public sector undertakings are getting
momentum in India 
But uh as a guide I should say that number of public 
sector undertakings in the country some are no profit no loss basis 
Some are only dealing profit making 
And this actually this undertaking this Hindustan Latex
Limited Kanagala was established by Central Health and Family Welfare
ministry on March nineteen eighty-seven 
So till today it is hardly some eight years old eight or
less than that 
This factory is now producing condom Mala-D Mala-N
etcetra and transporting such goods to Madras Bombay Calcutta Surat Delhi
Objective of the study the candidate argues that to study
the organisation in administrative problems of the Hindustan Latex Limited
Kanagala it is very essential to understand this study from its
perspective of growth of public sector undertakings in India in general
 and Karnataka in particular 
In this context the study tries to understand the origin and
growth of this public sector with reference to the public undertakings in
India 
The major coordination administration the personnel and
financial problem as well as problems concerning labourers will be
studied 
It also studies the production capacity cost of production and
transporting goods to outside the country as well as within India 
is has also undertaken 
For this purpose he has mention his one methodology 
It it says that the study based on empirical research 
The primary data will be collected by using photo one word
 techniques such as interview and questionnaire method 
And candidate also argue that he intend to use questionnaire and
interview technique for official one word as well as the workers
To obtain as clear a view as possible we try to include the
Governmental official about the problem of raw materials for factory 
cost and transportation in relative problems 
Minutes of the meetings will be used for the purpose of
understanding crucial problems concerning this public sector 
Apart from this primary data secondary data will be collected by
using annual report journals periodicals and other published materials
relevant to the subject
So the data and matter are the subject undertaken by the
candidate
He feels that he can manage the subject within uh 
two words three years or four years which is required for Ph D
degree
And the continuous chapterisation given by the candidate one is
introduction second is the profile of the factory third is
administrative organisation fourth is production and finance fifth is
personnel administration sixth is conclusion and recommendation 
So it seems that the candidate wants to comprehend the
organisation working of the this public undertaking with reference to 
certain broad areas like administrative organisation personnel
administration finance production etcetera 
I think the candidate can manage the work in the
prescribed time limit in parts
