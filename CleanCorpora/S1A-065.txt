<I>
""
""
My name is Vina Menezes I am from Goa 
""
""
Hello Vina I am Charu from Pilani Rajasthan
""
""
Oh 
""
""
 really indeed very nice we all
have come so far from our different places to this place to attend this
programme 
""
And it is really nice that  so close
here together 
""
""
 and so friendly we
became here 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So you tell me now something about Pilani 
""
Like uh you know the climate and uh on the on the ways of dressing
of 
""
""
 clears
her throat 
""
""
""
""
""
 uh very varying because you
know  desert area
""
""
Oh
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
And what about monsoon
""
""
Monsoon we rarely get any rains  uh say say in September
 when the monsoon is receding from India then we get rains for four or
five days 
""
""
 hope it was the
case in Goa also
""
""
You have heavy rains
""
""
Yeah Goa  raining very heavily and you can't go
anywhere out also  uhm
""
""
Yeah that is there in Goa also
""
""
Even when you go to school or anywhere  you
have to face a lot of problems  standing because of rain
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And all the water would get clogged  and
there
""
Even traffic and all is getting jammed  then
you have to wait there  clear and all
""
""
And what about the summers
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Summers are 
""
I don't suppose you have so hot summers in Goa because
""
""
Yeah Goa is not that very hot
""
You know summer I think that is the right time you can enjoy in Goa
""
""
We have lot of social activities  uh cultural activities that
time you 
""
That is the right time I think if you come to Goa you will enjoy
 will not advise
any one to come  in rainy season
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
In Pilani  just the reverse you know what is rainy
season for others it is pleasant  for us
""
""
""
""
""
So you must be enjoying that season
""
""
That season yeah
""
September and October we enjoy a lot
""
""
Uhm
""
""
But  really
horrible  the temperatures shoot up nearly to fifty
""
""
So it is just the opposite
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Just the opposite exactly
""
""
Even in winters  so very much cold in Pilani no
""
And summers are so hot temperature goes to nearly fifty
""
Winters temperature go in minus
""
Again because  desert no
""
So so high variation of temperatures 
""
In Goa you won't have so  cool winters no
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah we didn't have 
""
""
Cool winter 
""
Very nice 
""
So much 
""
""
Will you come to Goa 
""
""
Yes of course I will come sometimes if god sends me  and
you too have to come
""
""
God sends me means what  you have you can come no like that
""
""
Yeah that depends
""
""
When
""
""
Of course I  to I want to come
""
""
""
""
""
You should try
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Very soon 
""
""
And when are you planning to come to my place
""
""
Ah 
""
After another 
""
""
So long
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
Why
""
""
There are some plans behind that 
""
""
May I know those plans
""
""
Uh 
laughter 
""
""
""
""
Okay  how and when do you write letters
to

""
""
""
""
Yes social life is there but  uh there are not so many parties
 uh as I suppose you have in Goa right

You can really enjoy life in Goa you know

Our government is not showing difference like that
""
""
Okay
""
""
Yeah that is one thing is nice 
""
""
Uh
""
""
And then their festivals like Ganesh 
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
Yeah Holi also we have
""
""
Uh

""
""
""
""
Not much but I enjoy 
""
""
And what about  Diwali
""
""
""
""
""
Diwali also
""
 we
go to their place
""
Even if we don't go to their places they make it a point to get
the sweets in the school or wherever it is otherwise  pack it
and they will give you yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
They used to yeah
""
""
""
""
And  all illuminations and all everything is there
""
""
Yeah yeah yeah
""
""
Light lamp everything
""
""
Yeah yeah yeah
""
""
It looks beautiful
""
""
Beautiful yeah
""
Specially in the cities if you go no  you can
really have fun
""
""
""
""
""
And what do you do on your festivals 
""
""
Yeah I know we are having  like
uh uh town-wise or village-wise  each club is organising
dances beach shows and all you know
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So you can have your choice
""
Otherwise even on the  yeah
we are having different beaches and all no people go on the beaches and they
enjoy
""
""
""
""
""
Uh like we have have 
""
""
We don't remain in the houses
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
And houses no  pooja
 and all these kind of things
""
""
""
""
""
Ah we do all that
""
""
And then you go to church or any other
""
""
Yeah after prayer
""
""
Home
""
""
Yeah
""
We go the church and all mass  and then after
that we go for discos 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Religious part is first and then the other things  laughs
""
""
""
Yes
""
For us no  we have to do
all the  and all
""
""
Yeah that is religious you have to do that first
""
""
Yeah  and I think that
is that occupies our most of the time
""
""
""
""
""
Ahm
""
""
Particularly in Diwali days  Laxmi
pooja  and all that
""
""
Uhm there
""
""
So so really if you started seven till nine  pooja
 and decoration and everything
""
""
That you must do previous day 
""
""
No previous day we never do
""
""
No
""
Because the decoration and all 
""
Same day you all do
""
""
I think uh because
""
""
No No in Goa we play we do the preparations  much in
advance 
""
""
 that we have probably because
people are  now in service no
""
So they can't do  before hand
""
So only the day of Diwali and all we we don't get so many holidays
in between no one or two days 
""
We have major holidays in winters and summer because of extreme
climates
""
""
""
""
""
Like for example we have 
""
""
Ten days we have 
""
You know we divide the days
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Cleaning of the house or decoration of the house 
 uhm
""
""
Everything we do like this systematically and see that you are
very much free on that day 
uhm  like that yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For us no we get two days on uh Diwali one Diwali day and the
next day same must 
holiday and next day 
""
Otherwise we don't get any 
""
So one day  that very day you get holiday so whole day cleaning
up and everything then preparing sweets
""
""
""
""
""
Okay how you will prepare the sweets means only your family
members prepare take part in your preparation  or some
neighbours  help
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We make ours neighbour makes theirs
""
And now a days  uh most of the people going in for buying
sweets  by readymade
""
""
""
""
""
Even that is the  style now
""
""
So do you think all 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  the problem
""
""
Life is now becoming too much  busy and
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  right
""
""
Earlier too my mother used to make everything at home
""
She never bought anything from out
""
""
Now it is not possible  because you know
every one is working 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay tell me something about your school where you go and uh
""
""
Okay my school no is very far from my 
place
""
I have to get up early in the morning  and by
six I have to be on the bus 
""
And then  three four buses I have to change
""
 tiresome journey
""
I'll  when the school gets over also after
coming  by four
""
""
You must not be facing that problem you must be staying somewhere
close
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
Small campus  and everthing is very much closely packed there
 that
everything comes within that area
""
Nearly in two kilometers area whole campus  has been made
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  to our
Institute we have to go either we go walking or we have bicycle
""
""
So nice it is yeah
""
""
Very nice
""
""
We can't do that because you know mine is government school
no
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So even if I have to ask transfer I have to ask transfer in
uh government school
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Private schools are there many
""
""
Yeah
""
""
But uh they are of no use for me because I can't take
transfer in the government school in the private school
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I have to take in the government school because 
uhm  it is government school
""
""
""
""
""
So it will take some time  transfer and
all
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah and government schools I think are better than private
schools  right
""
""
They say but in Goa they have different view
""
""
""
""
""
Their opinion is different
""
""
Oh yes it means  uh because
for studying point of view I think  uh
""
""
It depends everything on the headmaster you know
""
If the head is good everything is good
""
""
Yeah that is there
""
""
Because if the headmaster or the principal is very lenient
then the teachers are also  very lenient they do
what they want and then naturally it affects the students
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
So if he is good then I think everything goes smooth 
""
""
So your  like
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Uhm very nice 
""
In our Pilani no
""
""
""
Uh but  and nothing is so much controlled by our
Director
""
""
Director
""
""
We have Director
""
Yeah 
""
""
Even we have in Goa 
""
""
So teachers it depends lot on teacher how 
handles his 
""
So we have particular hours allotted to us
""
""
""
""
""
We have to go there 
""
""
Finally okay everything is regulated by the Director and all
the staff authorities but 
 we have to produce good results
because finally it reflects by  no how you
were teaching
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
But sometimes I feel that in schools that kind of 
mentality is not
""
""
See I will tell you  you are teaching in the school is
better
""
 teaching in the college is better
than  the school
""
Because in school  lot of responsibilites are
there
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
In the in the college I think there is not  much
responsibility as such
""
""
Responsibilities like
""
""
In the sense see you have to do your  duty well teach and
go like
""
""
Uhm okay
""
""
Prepare or teach and go
""
But in the school what happens you have to see that  these
students learn
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Otherwise  the headmaster will pounce on you
""
""
Uhm
""
""
However that the parents also come and complain 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You can't teach in your own ways you know like you know if
they don't know you should tell everything in English they don't understand
you have to use mother tongue
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And if you use mother tongue  they they
understand but the thing is that your language English language is going down
""
You get used to that language you know
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
I don't like to teach in school I prefer in the college only
""
""
Uhn
