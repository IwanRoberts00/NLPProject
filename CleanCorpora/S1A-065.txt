Hello Vina I am Charu from Pilani Rajasthan
Oh it's nice to meet you here in the

And it is really nice that all of us has come so close
here together 
 Yeah and we met each other and so friendly we
became here 
Yeah
So you tell me now something about Pilani 
Like uh you know the climate and uh on the on the ways of dressing
of 
 O okay about climate first of clears
her throat 
 Yeah 
 Pilani's climate is uh very varying because you
know it's a desert desert area
Oh
So summers are too hot too hot 
 Hot 
And what about monsoon
Monsoon we rarely get any rains uh say say in September
 when the monsoon is receding from India then we get rains for four or
five days and that too very slightly 
 So nice you know like that hope it was the
case in Goa also
You have heavy rains
Yeah Goa it's raining very heavily and you can't go
anywhere out also uhm
Yeah that is there in Goa also
Even when you go to school or anywhere out you
have to face a lot of problems yeah standing because of rain
 here there and all 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
And all the water would get clogged here and
there
Even traffic and all is getting jammed uh uh then
you have to wait there till it get ah ha clear and all
And what about the summers
 Ah 
 Uh uh 
 Ah ah 
Summers are well they are very hot 
I don't suppose you have so hot summers in Goa because
Yeah Goa is not that very hot
You know summer I think that is the right time you can enjoy in Goa
We have lot of social activities uh cultural activities that
time you know 
That is the right time I think if you come to Goa you will enjoy
 uh uh and not rainy season I don't will not advise
any one to come laughs in rainy season
 Uhn 
 Uh uh 
Yeah 
In Pilani it's just the reverse you know what is rainy
season for others it is pleasant season for us
 Yeah 
So you must be enjoying that season
That season yeah
September and October we enjoy a lot
Uhm
But summers are June and May and June it's really
horrible because the temperatures shoot up nearly to fifty
 degrees 
So it is just the opposite
 One word 
 Ah 
Just the opposite exactly
Even in winters it's so very much cold in Pilani no
And summers are so hot temperature goes to nearly fifty
Winters temperature go in minus
Again because it's desert no
So so high variation of temperatures 
In Goa you won't have so no cool winters no
 No 
Yeah we didn't have 
Cool winter 
Very nice yaar 
So much one word

You can really enjoy life in Goa you know
 Uh 
Yeah
Yeah and you must come with only one thing that you know
What it is
 laughter 
And you must have nice company yeah 
Yeah dancing and 
 Yeah yeah yeah drinking it's very
westernised you know
Ha 
Highly influence like
 Accha which is the major religion in Goa
Uh Hindu 
Hindus are more yeah than Christians
 Yeah 
Hindu
Uh Christians uhm and Muslims they are few
 Uhm 
Few
Muslims very few are there
Uhm these two are
Uhm
So uh do you do the Hindus and muslims look uh
 one word and Christians one word live close by and like
they have is there association
 Close by 
Yeah yeah yeah 
 There's no differance as such you know
Oh yeah
And we have different festivals of Christians festivals and
Hindus festival in which we take part you know
Yeah you take part 
 You don't feel that differenc here
They take part in our functions uhm our festivals
and we take in theirs
What I know you no 
 Uhm 
 What are the festivals 
Ours Christmas Easter New Year 
These are the three main
Uhm
So they all come and celebrate
Yeah we have holidays for our fe festivals and
for their festivals also we have holidays
Oh I see
Our government is not showing difference like that
Okay
Yeah that is one thing is nice 
Uh
And then their festivals like Ganesh 
 Chaturthi and 
 Chaturthi yeah and then 
uh Diwali
Diwali yeah
Holi do you have
Yeah Holi also we have
Uh 
So you like Holi
Yeah of course why not 
 You play 
Not much but I enjoy laughs looking at them 
And what about and Diwali
 And 
Diwali also
 They invite us and all no and we
go to their place
Even if we don't go to their places they make it a point to get
the sweets in the school or wherever it is otherwise they'll pack it
and they will give you yeah
 Do you one word 
 Uhm 
Yeah that's two words 
They used to yeah
 Distribute them 
And uh all illuminations and all everything is there
Yeah yeah yeah
Light lamp everything
Yeah yeah yeah
It looks beautiful
Beautiful yeah
Specially in the cities if you go no uhm you can
really have fun
 Uhm 
And what do you do on your festivals 
Yeah I know we are having uh uh different clubs like
uh uh town-wise or village-wise and each club is organising
dances beach shows and all you know
 Uhm 
Uhm
So you can have your choice
Otherwise even on the accha yeah
we are having different beaches and all no people go on the beaches and they
enjoy
 Accha 
Uh like we have have cer 
We don't remain in the houses
Yeah yeah
And houses no yeah we have pooja
 and all these kind of things
 Yeah 
Ah we do all that
And then you go to church or any other
Yeah after prayer
Home
Yeah
We go the church and all mass uhm and then after
that we go for discos and enjoy 
 Uhm 
 Go and enjoy 
Religious part is first and then the other things laughs
Yes
For us no what happens is first of all we have to do
all the pooja and all
Yeah that is religious you have to do that first
Yeah haan and I think that
is that occupies our most of the time
 Haan 
Ahm
Particularly in Diwali days they have to do Laxmi
pooja and all that
Uhm there
So so really if you started seven till nine pooja
 and decoration and everything
That you must do previous day na 
No previous day we never do
No
Because the decoration and all 
Same day you all do
I think uh because
No No in Goa we play we do the preparations much in
advance not on the same day 
 What happens that we have probably because
people are now in service no
So they can't do uh before hand
So only the day of Diwali and all we we don't get so many holidays
in between no one or two days 
We have major holidays in winters and summer because of extreme
climates
 Uh 
Like for example we have uh holidays for christmas no 
 uhm 
Ten days we have 
You know we divide the days
 Uhm 
Uhm
Cleaning of the house or decoration of the house 
 oh yes making sweets and then for the tailor day uhm
Everything we do like this systematically and see that you are
very much free on that day uhm festival day 
uhm like that yeah
 Oh yes 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
For us no we get two days on uh Diwali one Diwali day and the
next day same must one or two words holi Diwa 
holiday and next day uh 
Otherwise we don't get any 
So one day that very day you get holiday so whole day cleaning
up and everything then preparing sweets
 Uhm 
Okay how you will prepare the sweets means only your family
members prepare take part in your preparation uh or some
neighbours come to no help
 Uh 
 No 
We make ours neighbour makes theirs
And now a days uh most of the people going in for buying
sweets yes by readymade
 Yes 
Even that is the style now
So do you think all a few words 
 A few words 
Yeah that's the problem
Life is now becoming too much very busy and
 Very 
Yeah that's right
Earlier too my mother used to make everything at home
She never bought anything from out
Now it is not possible yeah because you know
every one is working 
 Yeah 
 Accha 
Okay tell me something about your school where you go and uh
Okay my school no is very far from my uhm 
place
I have to get up early in the morning uhm and by
six I have to be on the bus stand 
And then three four buses I have to change
 It's very you know oh tiresome journey
 and by the time I reach to school uhm you know what 
I'll be and then after when the school gets over also after
coming from that also I reach very late uh uh by four
 O'clock like that 
You must not be facing that problem you must be staying somewhere
close
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Oh 
 Uhm 
 Uh uh 
Yeah in Pilani we have a campus 
Small campus and everthing is very much closely packed there
 uhm like so everything is so organised no that
everything comes within that area
Nearly in two kilometers area whole campus has been made
 Uhm 
 Everything is there 
 Haan so one word 
And uhm everything is close by you just go to our
Institute we have to go either we go walking or we have bicycle
So nice it is yeah
Very nice
We can't do that because you know mine is government school
no
Yeah
So even if I have to ask transfer I have to ask transfer in
uh government school
Uhm
Private schools are there many
Yeah
But uh they are of no use for me because I can't take
transfer in the government school in the private school
Yeah
I have to take in the government school because 
uhm it is government school
 Uhm 
So it will take some time uhm transfer and
all
 Uhm 
Yeah and government schools I think are better than private
schools that's what atleast everyone says right
They say but in Goa they have different view
 Laughs 
Their opinion is different
Oh yes it means uh in north India atleast uh because
for studying point of view I think private schools are better but uh
It depends everything on the headmaster you know
If the head is good everything is good
Yeah that is there
Because if the headmaster or the principal is very lenient
then the teachers are also uh uhm very lenient they do
what they want and then naturally it affects the students
 Uhm 
Yes
So if he is good then I think everything goes smooth 
So your headmaster's like
Ah he's very nice to me 
Uhm very nice 
In our Pilani no
 It's a private institution 
Uh but uh uhm and nothing is so much controlled by our
Director
Director
We have Director
Yeah 
Even we have in Goa two or three words 
So teachers it depends lot on teacher how how he 
handles his class and all 
So we have particular hours allotted to us
 Manages 
We have to go there 
Finally okay everything is regulated by the Director and all
the staff authorities but we have so much uh like consciousness 
 yeah means we have to do good we have to produce good results
because finally it reflects by on us that's no how you
were teaching
 Yeah 
 Yeah yeah 
Yeah
But sometimes I feel that in schools that kind of uh 
mentality is not
See I will tell you you are teaching in the school is
better
 I'm sorry uh teaching in the college is better
than uhm the school
Because in school there's lot of responsibilites are
there
 Uhm 
Yeah
In the in the college I think there is not much
responsibility as such
Responsibilities like
In the sense see you have to do your duty well teach and
go like
Uhm okay
Prepare or teach and go
But in the school what happens you have to see that these
students learn
Uhm
Otherwise the headmaster will pounce on you
Uhm
However that the parents also come and complain 
Yeah
You can't teach in your own ways you know like you know if
they don't know you should tell everything in English they don't understand
you have to use mother tongue
Uhm
And if you use mother tongue uh they they
understand but the thing is that your language English language is going down
You get used to that language you know
 Uh 
Uh so because of that way lot of you know difference 
I don't like to teach in school I prefer in the college only
Uhn
