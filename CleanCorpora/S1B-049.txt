In all good ever hope to be 
""
That then what they conventional wisdom 
""
Until beginning nineteen eighty-seven  All India Radio undertook
a series of broadcast  a new experiment in integrated social
broadcasting  of a style magnitude and complexity unprecedented anywhere
in the world 
""
These broadcasts have been a spectacular success 
""
The credit for this goes to the vision  the
committment and the leadership 
""
His name 
""
His job  Director General of All India Radio
""
And right now as you can see he is with us in our studio 
""
Mr Shinde sir thank you very much for joining us in the studios of
the morning show 
""
Now you began with the series on social forestry in nineteen
eighty-seven 
""
Then you moved on to method of science to  Jeevan Saurabh
 to radio date and so on
""
What is the  origin of this idea ?
""
How did you decide that  radio should now play some kind of a
more active role  ?
""
""
After the 
uh in fact we in broadcasting  the professionals were little disturbed
because the listening 
""
And because one factor was 
""
The programme pattern of radio  to
the listeners 
""
Secondly the television the new media which was  progressing in
this country and expanding  was able to
provide a lot of entertainment  good entertainment quiet good
entertainment 
""
So we were worried that how  shift our programme
pattern in such a way  and
keep our uh 
""
In search of this  arranged many seminars and
workshop at different places 
""
I have moved from places to places I have discussed uh  the
problems with professionals 
""
And uh  to the
conclusion especially  form
 especially programmes for the rural audiences
""
""
That if we go in for subjects and programmes  which are
directly concerned to a listener  need of some
information  and where they
are 
""
I think that area if we adopt  and feel what the listeners see
in that programming  achieve the
success desired 
""
And the first experiment we started  at A I R Bangalore in
nineteen eighty-seven 
""
The programme series was known as 
social forestry 
""
And this programme was planned in  collaboration and
cooperation with this uh  Forest Department of Karnataka
government 
""
And we worked out thirteen episodes 
""
And uh  those thirteen episodes were evolved after discussing
with various  taking a tryst in
the field 
""
Total of programmes we took in the field
""
And uh  and impact of
the programme on the listeners 
""
And then we 
""
And we thought we should 
to be more effective 
""
And that is what we adopted
""
And it proved very successful 
""
This particular programme was subsequently  introduced on all
India basis 
""
And for that purpose we invited applications  from our listeners
to register 
""
So response was our 
lakh 
""
But the response was so tremendous as we got hundred and forty
thousand 
we requested the listeners 
""
So that was the uh response in the beginning 
""
Then after the completion of the series
""
 series we got number of letters and it was
""
""
And we conducted open  to just assess
""
""
How 
""
It is not only that 
""
But whether  acquired this and
retained it 
""
And through these open examinations  we observed that more than
seventy-five 
registered listeners appeared for the open book examination 
""
And their degree of  knowledge was about
seventy-three percent correct 
""
And large number of of  prizes were given
to the first  into the new format
""
""
""
Uhm  laughs
 this revolutionary series of broadcast
 ?
""
""
Yes of course because 
there is always a tendency that we always uh want to glorify the past 
""
And uh  there is always a resistence for new ideas new
experiments 
""
And it was there 
""
And people thought but who is going to  and suggest
after all 
""
They are for years together they know about forest
""
What new things 
""
And it is a very cumbersome thing with no achievement about it 
""
But 
""
Let us see how we get this one 
we will never know whether we are going correctly or not correctly
""
Or whether we should pursue this particular format or not 
""
And after the efforts were done the series was introduced and
concluded 
""
We found it was the most successful format  good
""
""
""
 ne ye
abhiyan kiya jisse  ka
nam diya hai  the
actual name for 
""
""
Uh 
education
""
""
Right
""
Now  you did this in thirty episode which is the largest radio
series of its kind anywhere in the world 
""
Uh what  prompted you to go in for this ?
""
What have been your  experiences ?
""
What were the shortcomings if any that you noticed ?
""
And what is your assessment  ?
""
""
""
""
""
See uh  we always lookout for some
area and subjects 
""
And any problem we come across  we always want to see from the
angle of whether we can  for programming and we can
""
information 
""
Uh it is actually I myself was a chain smoker 
""
For ten years I was smoking fifty cigars per day 
""
And nineteen sixty-two I left it  one or
two words 
""
One day I was coming from uh  Malaysia via Singapore
""
At the airport I saw  one word
""
""
And within two minutes I found she started smoking and the whole
""
""
And that struck me whether  this particular subject we should
take in 
""
Because uh 
""
You can sell tobacco anywhere and talk to anybody 
""
There is no control of smoking 
""
Any person from child five years  to ninety years smokes no
control over it 
""
No restriction on the place of smoking 
""
There is restriction 
""
There are dry areas
""
But for tobacco  consumption there is no restriction no law at
all 
""
So I thought this is area which is 
spread over this  or what can
say addiction
""
So radio can play very important role  because the reach of
radio 
""
And uh  so we thought we
should work out on these bases 
""
But how to work out how to go about it 
""
So we actually  to
whether they can help us  information
whether we can  uh work out
""
And then in collaboration with this 
""
We evolved this series 
because they adviced that that we should also include  and uh
 as a part of the whole series
""
And 
""
And we involved number of experts who have done lot of research
work  in tobbaco areas
""
And it was found  every druggist or alcoholic
person has graduated from smoking 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
He initially  and
then he has gone to that level 
""
So  that this
series must be taken very seriously and we should do 
and contribute something substantial  one
word 
""
And thats how this we started working on it 
""
And then thereafter 
""
And same methodology adopted 
""
First we 
we prepared prototypes 
""
Took the  and
came back
""
And whatever the deficiencies we found out 
""
During the testing they were removed 
""
And then final programme was 
""
And the same technique was adopted
""
We invited application 
""
Because we wanted that our listeners should be  the same
listener throughout the series
""
And he should be seriously involved 
""
And we were happy to know that  were listener
""
""
And the impact was so tremendous  number
of people who wrote to us 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Yes
""
Now I C M R is conducting  at
Bangalore and Calcutta 
""
That those people who wrote to us  and they gave up the smoking
or drug addiction 
""
What is happening to them thereafter  ?
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So that was the 
""
""
As a television person uh  my heart is with television
""
""
You will appreciate that 
""
My mind agrees with what you were saying sir 
""
But now this experience that  gained from this
earlier series on methods of science  jeevan sourabh jo aapane kiya
aur ab radio date ka aapane jikar kiya
""
To jo aapko tajurba huwa anubhav huwa hain  uske aadhar par ab
aap kya karne lage hain  ?
""
""
""
human evolution 
""
Ye  serial
 dunya mei aise vishay par itna
lamba 
vikas ka jo hissa hain 
one word  institution
 bhi isme
 this National Council
of Science and Technology also been involved 
""
Some eminent scientists are involved  and some
persons 
""
And we have worked out the  now doing last one
and half year we were working on this project 
""
 ho chuka
hain 
""
Aur is  wohi hain
""
""
""
communication 
""
Two-way communication technique 
""
Aur uske baad  survey
conducted 
""
To see the impact 
""
The whole object appears our object is to  generate a
scientific temper 
""
""
""
Ek aadat ban jaaye ki har cheej ko ye aisa aisa kyo hota hain  ?
""
Kaise hota hain ?
""
Manushya kin kin awastha se kyo gujara hain ?
""
Uska  mein ye parivartan kaisa aaya
 ?
""
Why that  ?
""
And  to this stage ?
""
And what is next  ?
""
Where are you going ahead  ?
""
So this kind of the different of facets  of the human evolution
""
""
""
Within a particular series like this one on human  uh
evolution  ?
""
""
That subject we discussed with various 
""
And also we conducted surveys
""
And we try  which are
the areas where the information is required more 
""
And where are the areas where the information is very less
available 
at his level in the villages or interior areas 
""
So that kind of information we want to see
""
It is vital information 
""
And without that information the further information which we are
going to give to them 
""
So so that we have to link up  and see that
there is no gap of information 
""
As well as information which is needed  is
given 
""
""
Uhm 
""
Let me be the 
yeah 
""
 demonstrated
beyond the shadow of doubt that radio  is still a very effective medium
for social education and social change 
""
Then what about uh family welfare family planning 
""
""
""
""
""
That is another aspect  telling you
""
Because  putting out more
than six thousand programmes every month 
""
And there also the success is so great  latest
surveys all the surveys which have been conducted  for different places
 first source of information
on family welfare 
""
""
Uhm  all right
""
Now on the table in front of us  Mr Director General there are
 these little kits lying
""
Would you like to tell us what they are  ?
""
""
So this was the kits which were 
method of science 
""
So these kits were  is
there
""
""
Let me
""
""
It is on do  yourselves
""
I can just show you  this
""
This 
""
Now these are the lenses which were supplied 
""
Because  uh lessons were there
""
And certain experiments were shown  to the listener
""
The kits were  to one
lakh forty thousand 
""
And this is the stone 
""
So that  try this experiment at
home 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And we also provided a chart  a big huge chart was shown
to them 
""
This type
""
""
Which one is it  ?
""
Is it the chart ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
This is it 
""
You can see this is a chart of uh 
""
See here
""
""
Here 
""
""
So every thing was available in advance  with the
listeners
""
""
I see
""
""
And that before the days programme was started they had to
read this particular portion  and also the questions were raised
""
What kind of uh 
""
And when they listen the programme and then write to us and
experiment with this kit 
""
""
Uhm this is obviously a new concept in distance education
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
Uh  ek sawal aur uthta hain ki jo baaki
antarashtriya 
""
Jo aapne abhiyan kiya hain aur shandaar aapko safalta mili hain un
hone isme kuchh dilchaspi prakat ki  ?
""
""
 iske baareme hamne baat ki thi pichhle dino
 meeting
""
""
Wahan par iske upar kafi charcha hui thi  aur khaas taur se jo
vikas sheel desh hain  unhone hamse iske baareme
kafi 
experiment 
 ki hum kis tarahse
 communal
broadcasting uh  hui
thi usmein bhi ispar kafi charcha hui 
""
Aur woh log hairat me hain ke 
""
And uh how it is possible without the visual aids  ?
""
Merely if  a stromg medium we are able to go ahead
""
""
""
Well the Director General gave us a peep into the future
""
What comes after the serial on human evolution  ?
""
""
See 
""
And we are conducting some surveys to find out which are the areas
where  want
""
""
Because we want to be very sure  this
particular area needs 
""
And then we identify the subjects and then we work on this basis
""
""
But our aim will be 
""
""
Well sir thank you  very much for having been with us on
the  morning show
""
As uh 
""
As you do this on radio
