In all good ever hope to be 
""
""
""
""
a series of broadcast  a new experiment in integrated social
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now you began with the series on social forestry in nineteen
""
""
Then you moved on to method of science to  Jeevan Saurabh
""
""
What is the  origin of this idea ?
""
How did you decide that  radio should now play some kind of a
""
""
""
""
""
because the listening 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we were worried that how  shift our programme
""
keep our uh 
""
In search of this  arranged many seminars and
workshop at different places 
""
""
problems with professionals 
""
And uh  to the
conclusion especially  form
""
""
""
""
directly concerned to a listener  need of some
information  and where they
""
""
I think that area if we adopt  and feel what the listeners see
""
success desired 
""
And the first experiment we started  at A I R Bangalore in
nineteen eighty-seven 
""
""
""
""
""
cooperation with this uh  Forest Department of Karnataka
""
""
And we worked out thirteen episodes 
""
""
with various  taking a tryst in
the field 
""
Total of programmes we took in the field
""
""
the programme on the listeners 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
India basis 
""
""
to register 
""
So response was our 
""
""
But the response was so tremendous as we got hundred and forty
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But whether  acquired this and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
seventy-three percent correct 
""
And large number of of  prizes were given
""
""
""
""
Uhm  laughs
""
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And people thought but who is going to  and suggest
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Let us see how we get this one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
nam diya hai  the
""
""
""
""
education
""
""
""
""
""
series of its kind anywhere in the world 
""
""
""
""
""
What were the shortcomings if any that you noticed ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh it is actually I myself was a chain smoker 
""
""
""
""
two words 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You can sell tobacco anywhere and talk to anybody 
""
There is no control of smoking 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I thought this is area which is 
""
say addiction
""
So radio can play very important role  because the reach of
radio 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we actually  to
""
""
""
""
""
We evolved this series 
""
 as a part of the whole series
""
""
""
""
work  in tobbaco areas
""
""
person has graduated from smoking 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
then he has gone to that level 
""
So  that this
series must be taken very seriously and we should do 
""
word 
""
And thats how this we started working on it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
came back
""
And whatever the deficiencies we found out 
""
During the testing they were removed 
""
""
""
And the same technique was adopted
""
""
""
""
""
""
And he should be seriously involved 
""
""
""
""
And the impact was so tremendous  number
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now I C M R is conducting  at
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You will appreciate that 
""
""
""
""
""
aur ab radio date ka aapane jikar kiya
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 dunya mei aise vishay par itna
""
vikas ka jo hissa hain 
""
 bhi isme
""
of Science and Technology also been involved 
""
""
persons 
""
And we have worked out the  now doing last one
""
""
""
hain 
""
""
""
""
""
communication 
""
Two-way communication technique 
""
""
conducted 
""
""
""
""
scientific temper 
""
""
""
Ek aadat ban jaaye ki har cheej ko ye aisa aisa kyo hota hain  ?
""
Kaise hota hain ?
""
Manushya kin kin awastha se kyo gujara hain ?
""
Uska  mein ye parivartan kaisa aaya
 ?
""
Why that  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this kind of the different of facets  of the human evolution
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That subject we discussed with various 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And where are the areas where the information is very less
""
""
""
""
""
It is vital information 
""
""
going to give to them 
""
So so that we have to link up  and see that
there is no gap of information 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
Let me be the 
""
""
 demonstrated
beyond the shadow of doubt that radio  is still a very effective medium
""
""
Then what about uh family welfare family planning 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because  putting out more
""
""
""
surveys all the surveys which have been conducted  for different places
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now on the table in front of us  Mr Director General there are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So these kits were  is
there
""
""
""
""
""
It is on do  yourselves
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And certain experiments were shown  to the listener
""
The kits were  to one
lakh forty thousand 
""
And this is the stone 
""
""
home 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Which one is it  ?
""
""
""

""
""
""
You can see this is a chart of uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And that before the days programme was started they had to
""
""
""
""
""

Uhm this is obviously a new concept in distance education

Wahan par iske upar kafi charcha hui thi  aur khaas taur se jo
