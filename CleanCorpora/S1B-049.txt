In all good ever hope to be 
That then what they conventional wisdom 
Until beginning nineteen eighty-seven All India Radio undertook
a series of broadcast in India a new experiment in integrated social
broadcasting of a style magnitude and complexity unprecedented anywhere
in the world 
These broadcasts have been a spectacular success 
The credit for this goes to the vision the dedication the
committment and the leadership of one man 
His name Amrit Rao Shinde 
His job Director General of All India Radio
And right now as you can see he is with us in our studio 
Mr Shinde sir thank you very much for joining us in the studios of
the morning show 
Now you began with the series on social forestry in nineteen
eighty-seven 
Then you moved on to method of science to Jeevan Saurabh
 to radio date and so on
What is the origin of this idea ?
How did you decide that radio should now play some kind of a
more active role in social broadcasting ?
After the introduction of colour television in India 
uh in fact we in broadcasting the professionals were little disturbed
because the listening has shifted to television 
And because one factor was dominating 
The programme pattern of radio was not very attractive to
the listeners 
Secondly the television the new media which was progressing in
this country and expanding uh with a great speed was able to
provide a lot of entertainment good entertainment quiet good
entertainment 
So we were worried that how we can shift our programme
pattern in such a way where we can attract the listeners and
keep our uh uh listening to the optimum 
In search of this we have arranged many seminars and
workshop at different places 
I have moved from places to places I have discussed uh the
problems with professionals 
And uh we come came to the
conclusion especially in the light of success of radio form
 forum especially programmes for the rural audiences
That if we go in for subjects and programmes which are
directly concerned to a listener and where they are in need of some
information or where they are in need of some guidance and where they
are uh looking for more kind of education 
I think that area if we adopt and feel what the listeners see
in that programming I'm sure this uh we can achieve the
success desired 
And the first experiment we started at A I R Bangalore in
nineteen eighty-seven 
The programme series was known as Nisarg Sampada 
social forestry 
And this programme was planned in collaboration and
cooperation with this uh one word Forest Department of Karnataka
government 
And we worked out thirteen episodes 
And uh those thirteen episodes were evolved after discussing
with various communicators experts and at taking a tryst in
the field 
Total of programmes we took in the field
And uh we assessed the success of the and impact of
the programme on the listeners 
And then we made some changes in the formats 
And we thought we should use two-way communication system 
to be more effective 
And that is what we adopted
And it proved very successful 
This particular programme was subsequently introduced on all
India basis in fifteen languages 
And for that purpose we invited applications from our listeners
to register forest one word 
So response was our plan was to register about one 
lakh listeners throughout the country 
But the response was so tremendous as we got hundred and forty
thousand and we felt that it is important for us to one word 
we requested the listeners the register has stop 
So that was the uh response in the beginning 
Then after the completion of the series
 Duri come series we got number of letters and it was
 unmanageble for us 
And we conducted open book examination to just assess
 how much our programme has been successful 
How much information the listener has retained 
It is not only that it they listen it 
But whether have they have acquired this and
retained it that is very important factor 
And through these open examinations we observed that more than
seventy-five persons percent of the 
registered listeners appeared for the open book examination 
And their degree of infor knowledge was about
seventy-three percent correct 
And large number of of exa the prizes were given
to the first and that was the how we got into the new format
Uhm uh sir did you face any kind of scepticism laughs
 when you decided to launch this revolutionary series of broadcast
 ?
Yes of course because uh among we professionals 
there is always a tendency that we always uh want to glorify the past 
And uh there is always a resistence for new ideas new
experiments 
And it was there 
And people thought but who is going to attain and suggest
after all people know about it 
They are for years together they know about forest
What new things you are going to impart 
And it is a very cumbersome thing with no achievement about it 
But I said Let us try and do it 
Let us see how we get this one because unless we try 
we will never know whether we are going correctly or not correctly
Or whether we should pursue this particular format or not 
And after the efforts were done the series was introduced and
concluded 
We found it was the most successful format that's good
 to a listeners beyond our expectations 
 Pichhle sal All India Radio ne ye
abhiyan kiya jisse jis karyakram ko aap ne Radio Date ka
nam diya hai Date standing for uh what what's the
actual name for 
Uh Radio Date Date drug alcohol tobacco 
education
Right
Now you did this in thirty episode which is the largest radio
series of its kind anywhere in the world right 
Uh what prompted you to go in for this ?
What have been your experiences ?
What were the shortcomings if any that you noticed ?
And what is your assessment of this experiment ?
 Right 
See uh as a broadcaster we always lookout for some
area and subjects 
And any problem we come across we always want to see from the
angle of whether we can use this subject for programming and we can
 use our uh technique of communication for the wider uh 
information and acceptance 
Uh it is actually I myself was a chain smoker 
For ten years I was smoking fifty cigars per day 
And nineteen sixty-two I left it once for all for one or
two words 
One day I was coming from uh Malaysia via Singapore
At the airport I saw a very good looking charming one word
 air-hostess was sitting there 
And within two minutes I found she started smoking and the whole
 her uh uh facial expression that whole thing has changed 
And that struck me whether this particular subject we should
take in 
Because uh tobacco as you know there is no control 
You can sell tobacco anywhere and talk to anybody 
There is no control of smoking 
Any person from child five years to ninety years smokes no
control over it 
No restriction on the place of smoking 
There is restriction for the drinking 
There are dry areas
But for tobacco consumption there is no restriction no law at
all uhm 
So I thought this is area which is common so commonly 
spread over this ha ha habit or what can
say addiction
So radio can play very important role because the reach of
radio is very much high and interior area especially 
And uh among the underprevileged classes so we thought we
should work out on these bases 
But how to work out how to go about it 
So we actually uh approached the I C C M R uh to
whether they can help us with this research and uh information
whether we can uh work out
And then in collaboration with this 
We evolved this series like Radio Date 
because they adviced that that we should also include drugs and uh
 uhm alchohol also as a part of the whole series
And that's how we started the series 
And we involved number of experts who have done lot of research
work in tobbaco areas
And it was found that the every druggist or alcoholic
person has graduated from smoking 
 Uhm 
Uhm
He initially smoking smoked and
then he has gone to that level 
So everybody was con uh convinced that this
series must be taken very seriously and we should do uh something 
and contribute something substantial for the improvement of this one
word health and over all atmosphere 
And thats how this we started working on it 
And then thereafter we worked out the format 
And same methodology adopted 
First we we conducted a workshop in fifteen languages 
we prepared prototypes 
Took the one word in the field tested them and
came back
And whatever the deficiencies we found out 
During the testing they were removed 
And then final programme was gone mass production 
And the same technique was adopted
We invited application called the registrations 
Because we wanted that our listeners should be the same
listener throughout the series
And he should be seriously involved 
And we were happy to know that everybody were listener
 who registered himself was communicating with us 
And the impact was so tremendous that there number
of people who wrote to us that they've given up smoking 
Uhm 
Yes
Now I C M R is conducting a post broadcast research at
Bangalore and Calcutta 
That those people who wrote to us and they gave up the smoking
or drug addiction thing 
What is happening to them thereafter ?
Uhm 
So that was the impact of this particular series 
As a television person uh my heart is with television
 laughs 
You will appreciate that 
My mind agrees with what you were saying sir 
But now this experience that you've gained from this
earlier series on methods of science jeevan sourabh jo aapane kiya
aur ab radio date ka aapane jikar kiya
To jo aapko tajurba huwa anubhav huwa hain uske aadhar par ab
aap kya karne lage hain ?
 Ab hamne ek naya serial uh kiya hain 
human evolution manushya ka vikas 
Ye serial ek kaafi lamba serial
 hoga abhi tak mere khayalse kisi dunya mei aise vishay par itna
lamba serial banaya nahin gaya aur manushka 
vikas ka jo hissa hain we were one word much of the 
one word isme bhi hamane bahutse institution
 ko liya hai Tata Fundamental Research bhi isme
 involve hain aur uh this National Council
of Science and Technology also been involved 
Some eminent scientists are involved Dr S R Rao and some
persons 
And we have worked out the one word now doing last one
and half year we were working on this project 
 Aur ab ye saara complete ho chuka
hain do June se hum ye shure kar rahe hain 
Aur is serial ka bhi technique wohi hain
 ke registration of the listeners 
 Aur uske baad listener se 
communication 
Two-way communication technique wohi tarika hoga 
Aur uske baad in between we are going to have survey
conducted 
To see the impact of the series 
The whole object appears our object is to generate a
scientific temper 
 Ki log har cheej ko vaigyanik drishti se dekhe 
Ek aadat ban jaaye ki har cheej ko ye aisa aisa kyo hota hain ?
Kaise hota hain ?
Manushya kin kin awastha se kyo gujara hain ?
Uska behaviour mein ye parivartan kaisa aaya
 ?
Why that one word changing ?
And we have come from where to this stage ?
And what is next ?
Where are you going ahead ?
So this kind of the different of facets of the human evolution
 are going to be discussed in this series 
Within a particular series like this one on human uh
evolution the sub-subject how do you decide then ?
That subject we discussed with various uh experts 
And also we conducted surveys
And we try we to assess ke which are
the areas where the information is required more 
And where are the areas where the information is very less
available or the common listener has no access for that information 
at his level in the villages or interior areas or in uh rural areas 
So that kind of information we want to see
It is vital information 
And without that information the further information which we are
going to give to them will not be relevant 
So so that we have to link up those areas and see that
there is no gap of information 
As well as information which is needed to the listeners is
given 
Uhm 
Let me be the devil's advocate for a moment 
yeah 
 Ye ye your experience obviously has demonstrated
beyond the shadow of doubt that radio is still a very effective medium
for social education and social change 
Then what about uh family welfare family planning 
 Yeah 
That is another aspect I'm telling you
Because family planning I think we are putting out more
than six thousand programmes every month 
And there also the success is so great that the latest
surveys all the surveys which have been conducted for different places
 have been uh uhn shown that the first source of information
on family welfare was radio 
Uhm all right
Now on the table in front of us Mr Director General there are
 these little kits lying
Would you like to tell us what they are ?
So this was the kits which were one or two words 
method of science 
So these kits were where you find the one word is
there
Let me
It is on do you it yourselves
I can just show you this
This 
Now these are the lenses which were supplied 
Because there was some certain uh lessons were there
And certain experiments were shown to the listener
The kits were provide provided to one
lakh forty thousand uh people all the registered 
And this is the stone covering that particular experiment 
So that the listener can himself try this experiment at
home how the things work 
Ah 
And we also provided a chart a big huge chart was shown
to them 
This type
Which one is it ?
Is it the chart ?
Yeah 
This is it 
You can see this is a chart of uh mega of science 
See here
Here 
So every thing was available in advance with the
listeners
I see
And that before the days programme was started they had to
read this particular portion and also the questions were raised
What kind of uh uh questions they can raise it 
And when they listen the programme and then write to us and
experiment with this kit 
Uhm this is obviously a new concept in distance education
Yes yes
Uh sir ek sawal aur uthta hain ki jo baaki
antarashtriya radio sansthaye hain 
Jo aapne abhiyan kiya hain aur shandaar aapko safalta mili hain un
hone isme kuchh dilchaspi prakat ki ?
 Ye iske baareme hamne baat ki thi pichhle dino
 Asia Basic Broadcasting Organisation ki meeting
 hui thi Singapore mein 
Wahan par iske upar kafi charcha hui thi aur khaas taur se jo
vikas sheel desh hain jo uske sadsya hain unhone hamse iske baareme
kafi material manga hain aur usse uh doosara 
experiment jo hamne pahle kiya tha uske liye hamare paas bhi 
 Ghana se log aaye the yaha dekh neke liye ki hum kis tarahse
 one word kar rahe hain kaise ja rahe hain aur communal
broadcasting uh association ki jo meeting hui
thi usmein bhi ispar kafi charcha hui 
Aur woh log hairat me hain ke radio can do so much 
And uh how it is possible without the visual aids ?
Merely if it's a stromg medium we are able to go ahead
Well the Director General gave us a peep into the future
What comes after the serial on human evolution ?
See uh we are thinking on some social uh areas 
And we are conducting some surveys to find out which are the areas
where because without the input from the research we do not want
 to going go ahead 
Because we want to be very sure ke this
particular area needs the radio has to play a role 
And then we identify the subjects and then we work on this basis
But our aim will be only to take up the social issues 
Well sir thank you very much for having been with us on
the morning show
As uh they say more power to your lungs 
As you do this on radio
And we in television will be watching carefully somewhat enviously
but we will be watching nevertheless
Thank you very much Mr Director General for having been with us
Our guest this morning was Shri Amritrao Shinde Director General
of All India Radio and we have been talking to him about this spectacular
unprecedented experiment in terms of social integrated social
broadcasting that have been carried out by All India Radio for the first time
 in the world
