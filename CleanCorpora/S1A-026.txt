""
""
""
""
College English teacher  uh Bijapur branch
""
""

""
""
And uh  constituted mostly by my own students
""
""
For my retirement in nineteen eighty-nine  they got together
 uh a function to felicitate me
""
""
Uh
""
""
And as part of that uh felicitation function  they brought
out this collection of my radio talks 
""
""
It is really great 
""
""
One more that is uh  of course I could have done some more
work  but being an administrator
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I have been an administrator for more than twenty years 
""
For nearly twenty-five years I had been a principal of one college
and another 
""
I have headed three colleges 
""
Uh  as teacher and
administrator both
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
But because of uh administrative work  I have not been able
to do much 
""
Much of reading
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh  uh follows as a consequence
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah  attending to the
T V R I should say 
""
""
""
""
""
Though I  though I have worked as both teacher and an
administrator  a
teacher  at the graduate
level 
""
Uh I taught 
""
And uh  in that branch
of uh English studies  around there
""
""
In your place
""
""
Uh yeah 
""
And uh my  again
were middle English 
""
So after teaching uh literary criticism for a year or two  uh I
thought my notes  got up as a preparation for my class
teaching  could be published in book form
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
So  here and there
""
""
I could uh  bring them all in book form
""
""
You are thinking of a second edition 
""
""
No it has uh  one
or two words 
""
Of course this uh  I
made some addition  practical
criticism  practical
""
""
A new observation anyway 
""
""
And one chapter I added on the new critics 
""
At the insistance of a friend 
English Department at Karnataka University
""
Yeah she happens to be an old student of mine 
""
And then again I had a post script to do one of the chapter 
""
So this way it was uh 
""
So rather than reprinting as it is  I use to add something more
to the book
""
""
Sure 
""
""
Uh when it goes for third printing 
""
And what about you ?
""
Have you 
you are  experienced in printing and outsetting
""
""
""
""
""
It reminds me one thing 
""
Once only in my life as I am not a teacher  I tried to publish
a small book on  grammar
""
""
Grammar
""
""
Actually  for uh in
general for the students at the S S L C level and  this for final level
""
""
But it is  because of so many problems
""
""
That kind of progress  has been in my mind too
""
""
Oh yes 
""
of course so many books 
like it
""
""
""
""
""
But uh we don't have a book 
or useful to children 
""
So I I  especially
with regard to the uh examples 
""
Examples  but then it didn't work
""
Anyway I brought out a small 
it's  most uh efforts
""
""
Yeah  true
""
""
Printing some thing and I  once I thought of leaving
everything  uh finished it but then it was not
satisfactory
""
Then my aim I mean  uh I was uh I
wanted to be a teacher
""
""
Uh
""
""
But uh  and when
I did get the chance  and
now atleast
""
""
Oh so you didn't get a chance
""
""
Yeah a chance and
""
""
""
""
""
Uh go for some other job and now I am working as an officer
steno 
""
And uh  uh uh I
mean coming again to teaching 
""
And I took my 
English 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn
""
""
And now I am  doing my research in one of the topic in
English 
""
""
Good  very good
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I have no other I mean prospectus nor tried for because it
was late now I am age forty  so I
expect 
""
""
""
""
""
 to change the line and go back to
teaching after all
""
""
Of course I tried in many ways  after my
S S C  which I was doing was trying many fields
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn
""
""

one-word  and I studied for seven years
""
""
I studied uh some western music also  and I can play very well
""
Dynamora  forum
""
""
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
And uh I was the  the church choir being a
christian 
""
Well I tried many way  my
star was not bright I think
""
""
""
""
""
I see yeah
""
""
So I couldn't succeed
""
Anyway I joined here 
""
Anyway I am 
""
""
You seem to be versatile man with varied interests
""
""
Thank you 
""
""
I  from
""
""
""
""
""
Tried it
""
""
Tried it of course 
""
You see uh  abilities are not written
on his face anyway 
""
""
Oh yes yes
""
""
But then uh
""
""
It is uh  it versatile
because  we know how
little we actually know 
""
Accepted 
 I mean BA that
was in economics 
""
I simply  take the programme of teach
for a  without any reference or preparation I mean
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
But uh after taking my MA  without
preparation because 
""
""
No doubt
""
""
Means that uh when we go deep into a thing  then only we
know how less we do 
""
Then we have to prepare uh well
""
""
One has to recollect one stops on  uh
how we teach 
""
Before one  that is
literature 
""
No doubt for uh on every reading  possibly see the
new meaning in it  one see something new
""
""
""
""
""
Oh
""
""
 read the poem or
prose piece once again carefully before we  give a talk on it
