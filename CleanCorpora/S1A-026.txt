<I>
Let me introduce myself Dr Joseph 
 I'm G B Sajjan from the depot of Karnataka 
How long have you been teaching ?
No I am not a teacher I'm 
I see 
 I'm an officers steno working in a bank as a Junior
Secretary 
Uhm I'm myself a teacher 
I have uh worked as a teacher for more than uh three
decades I see at college level 
Uh I retired in nineteen eighty-nine 
Then took over as principal of a new one word college
near Bijapur
 I see 
Oh 
Well are you married ?
Yes I am married 
 Can I ask the question ?
Sure sure 
I am married I've got a child 
She is seven years old studying
Studying
Studying in uh second standard
Ah 
And my wife is a teacher teaching in a high
school in Kerala
I see 
She is also a school teacher
Yeah 
I have three children myself 
The eldest is a daughter 
She has completed her MBBS course and uh only recently
she is uh appointed as a tutor in the college where she studied
 That's fine 
My son is doing his Diploma course he is in the second
year 
And the younger daughter uh completed her PUC only last March
Well my elder daughter is not married yet 
Ah you said your uh your child is a son or a daughter ?
Daughter
Daughter so in what standard is she studying ?
Second standard 
Second standard 
Uh well tell something about uh your your field office
 that's I mean your hobbies or something like that 
Well my hobby is reading
Reading 
And nothing else nowadays 
I have given up seeing even movies
I don't see
Uhm I sort of create have created my own world
Yes
And it is reading and writing writing and reading
Yeah
Of course most of it is uh writing letters or letter uh
letter writing
Uh ha 
Uh I have published a book or two
Is it ?
Yeah I have written a book for uh B A English major
students
Ah ha that is something one word 
It is entitled Literary Criticism An Introduction
Ah ha 
And another book is a collection of my radio talks 
Oh you participated in radio talks also
Yeah
 That's good 
I kept uh about twenty talks 
Oh that is fine
And some fourteen or fifteen them fifteen of
them are collected uh brought together uh in a book
form
Oh 
And the book is entitled A Board Block
Ah ha 
And that was published by an association called 
Busset 
 A few words 
College English teacher uh Bijapur branch
Bijapur 
And uh it is uh constituted mostly by my own students
For my retirement in nineteen eighty-nine they got together
 uh a function to felicitate me
Uh
And as part of that uh felicitation function they brought
out this collection of my radio talks 
It is really great 
One more that is uh of course I could have done some more
work but being an administrator
Uhm
I have been an administrator for more than twenty years 
For nearly twenty-five years I had been a principal of one college
and another uh ha 
I have headed three colleges 
Uh in the thirty-seven years career as teacher and
administrator both
 Uh ha 
Ah ha 
But because of uh administrative work I have not been able
to do much 
Much of reading
Uhm 
And uh writing of course uh follows as a consequence
 and uh 
 But you didn't get enough time 
Ah I much of my time is wasted in uh attending to the
T V R I should say 
 Accha 
Though I though I have worked as both teacher and an
administrator I had more satisfaction as a administrator than as a
teacher because I did enjoy my teaching at the at the graduate
level uh especially teaching made in English 
Uh I taught one word for a number of years 
And uh I was the only so to say specialised in that branch
of uh English studies around there
In your place
Uh yeah 
And uh my specialities one or two words again
were middle English and uh literary teaching 
So after teaching uh literary criticism for a year or two uh I
thought my notes which I got up as a preparation for my class
teaching could be published in book form
Ah ha 
So uh after resigning one word here and there
I could uh bring them all in book form
You are thinking of a second edition 
No it has uh gone through a second edition also one
or two words now it is due for uh reprint again 
Of course this uh while it was printing the second time I
made some addition uh I had a chapter on uh this practical
criticism and I called it tentative notes for practical
A new observation anyway one word 
And one chapter I added on the new critics 
At the insistance of a friend who is now head of the 
English Department at Karnataka University
Yeah she happens to be an old student of mine 
And then again I had a post script to do one of the chapter 
So this way it was uh the second edition of the book 
So rather than reprinting as it is I use to add something more
to the book
Sure 
Uh when it goes for third printing 
And what about you ?
Have you done anywhere since you are 
you are experienced in printing and outsetting
 Ha yeah 
It reminds me one thing 
Once only in my life as I am not a teacher I tried to publish
a small book on grammar
Grammar
Actually that's functional grammar for uh in
general for the students at the S S L C level and this for final level
But it is one word because of so many problems
That kind of progress uh has been in my mind too
Oh yes I thought uh one or two word 
 specially in our state it's in Kerala we brought uh 
of course so many books borrowed from Andhra they one-word 
like it
 One-or-two-words 
But uh we don't have a book which is really meant for 
or useful to children one or two word 
So I I uh like to publish a small book especially
with regard to the uh examples 
Examples one-word but then it didn't work
Anyway I brought out a small one-word a book and 
it's uh printing material and it's most uh efforts
Yeah it's true
Printing some thing and I once I thought of leaving
everything uh but uh anyway I uh finished it but then it was not
satisfactory
Then my aim I mean it was my wish always uh I was uh I
wanted to be a teacher
Uh
But uh that's the only thing I couldn't and when
I did get the chance and uh if I got I missed it anyhow and
now atleast
Oh so you didn't get a chance
Yeah a chance and
 That's why you had to 
Uh go for some other job and now I am working as an officer
steno 
And uh I am still rethinking of teaching uh uh I
mean coming again to teaching 
And I took my PG degree in three subjects in 
English Malyalam and politics 
 I see 
 I see 
Ahn
And now I am doing my research in one of the topic in
English 
Good and very good
 And 
 I'm doing this course 
 That's only for Inter 
I have no other I mean prospectus nor tried for because it
was late now I am age forty oh I have been late so I
expect in that things 
 Oh 
 Now you want to change the line and go back to
teaching after all
Of course I tried in many ways uh after my
S S C uhm which I was doing was trying many fields
 Uh 
 Uhm 
Ahn
I tried some banks and I knew Kuchipudi and 
one-word Bharatnatyam oh and I studied for seven years
 and I studied Carnatic music also 
I studied uh some western music also and I can play very well
 some southern musical instruments and I participated in 
Dynamora one- word forum
 Oh 
Ah
And uh I was the one-word the church choir being a
christian 
Well I tried many way but uh luck as if my
star was not bright I think
 Oh you did 
I see yeah
So I couldn't succeed
Anyway I joined here as per my interest 
Anyway I am hopeful I fought for the best to come 
You seem to be versatile man with varied interests
Thank you laughter 
I couldn't have guessed as much from
 I did try it 
Tried it
Tried it of course 
You see uh cough man's abilities are not written
on his face anyway 
Oh yes yes
But then uh
It is uh call call it versatile
because my experience is when ever we go deep investing we know how
little we actually know 
Accepted I can feel that that from from 
 my own experience after simply taking a degree I mean BA that
was in economics 
I simply uh showed courage to take the programme of teach
for a wrestler without any reference or preparation I mean
Ahn 
But uh after taking my MA I will now try without
preparation because that's 
No doubt
Means that uh when we go deep into a thing then only we
know how less we do 
Then we have to prepare uh well
One has to recollect one stops on uh that's uh
how we teach literature 
Before one uh has to do any talking on that is
literature 
No doubt for uh on every reading once possibly see the
new meaning in it one see something new
 Sure sure 
Oh
 It's always better to read the poem or
prose piece once again carefully before we give a talk on it
 Yes 
Sure 
You know I used to have uh some other interest too
I used to be a sportsman at school 
And then college of course I my interests uh were
 tape recorded ultimately it's only books uh that
have remained my first and last interest
Uh
You may even call it my first and last love I'm 
the complete bookworm so to say
Yeah 
But then to deserve that affiliation that name
either kam dand one word 
Uhm uhm
Which I've not 
Then one's administration cuts into one's 
 time which I would like to devote to books
Well your major parts of your life was connected with a
lot of administration and all
Yeah that has to be yeah uh into most of my
time 
Moreover even uh managing the household
 Yeah 
Yes yes that familiar thing
 Yeah that takes a lot out of us 
 Yes 
Yes
Uh my Mrs is not a highly educated
Oh 
And uh so I have to take on most uh most of the burden
of the uh seeing to the childrens education sure their
requirements
 Sure 
Universal
Their upbringing
Yeah 
You know one-or-two-words 
 One-or-two-words 
My Mrs can't be of much help to me in my profession 
rather I have to be of some help to her
Oh
In fact in the household work
Yes 
So it's like that
So even that have claims over my time
Oh 
Which I wish could have been spent to my which I
might have devoted to reading and writing
Reading and writing
Yes 
 It's always the problem with we people 
 I've admired and been suffered with uh mine has been
a chequered career uhm I for studied in three
colleges I have taught in four colleges
 Uhm 
Uhm that's something great you have the
experience of teaching in different colleges
 And uh 
Again one or two words I had to to be without
any employment for six months uh I suffered uh break of service
And that told upon my one-word also 
I suffered a great loss in terms of one- word 
But uh none of that has been able to uh darken the
horizon of my mind 
You really you have the presence of mind to fetch the
boundary 
Yeah
Yeah that's uh one uh has to do 
Say then I just only remember for telling these night and
day dispute but never be defeated that these are the credit to our
 one-word 
One of these setbacks
Ah sure
Uh I have been able to tell upon my one-word 
tell upon my outlook on life 
I have always sought healthy thoughts 
And uh never looked back 
To
Especially in anger 
Never Look Back in Anger 
Ah not in anger 
Oh sure you not you should not
Regret uh regreting the steps I have taken
Yes
The buses that that I had missed
Ah ha 
The wrong turnings I have taken in life
Ah right 
 That's why I never looked back
Ah I see 
And uh had any regrets for whatever I myself
done or decided upon with my eyes open
Oh 
So life has it's ups and downs
Oh sure
