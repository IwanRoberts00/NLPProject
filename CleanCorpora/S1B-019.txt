Better you have your seat here 
""
No I will not sit 
""
Close the door 
""
Shakil don't play with handkerchief 
""
Okay what I intend to do today yesterday whatever I have taught you
regarding magnet 
""
Instead of giving class work to you today I will repeat the same
""
""
Okay let us start with  magnetism
""
What is magnetism  ?
""
Ravi  ?
""
What is magnetism  ?
""
""
Magnetism is uh  magnets attract
""
""
Magnet attracts  attracting pieces of iron is called
magnetism
""
Ajay  ?
""
""
So the magnet is called as  a substance which attracts uh
which has the quality of attracting other substances to it 
""
""
Other substances  ?
""
""
Iron is 
""
""
Who attracts iron  ?
""
""
Magnet 
""
""
Magnet
""
So this  magnetic
substances is called 
""
So we begin with magnetism 
""
What are the properties of  ?
""
Avinash  ?
""
Properties of a magnet 
""
Yes Avinash I am talking to you 
""
Uhm  uhm ?
""
""
Magnet attracts iron
""
""
Magnet always attracts iron and also magnetic substance is
called 
""
What is the second property Vikas ?
""
""
A freely suspended magnet always comes to rest pointing north
direction
""
""
What is a freely suspended magnet ?
""
Subhash  ?
""
 do you mean by freely
suspended  ?
""
Mahesh  ?
""
""
The magnet is tied to a  string and is left to suspend
""
""
We will have to take a stand 
hang it 
""
It will go on moving go on rotating for some time and after that
 always the same direction called north
and south 
""
Now this north pole of the magnet is actually the south pole of the
 earth
""
The south pole of the magnet is actually the north pole of the
earth
""
Can you tell me why ?
""
Ranjana  ?
""
 are they different ?
""
""
Because  unbalanced pole of the suspended and right pole of
the 
""
""
But we have only one magnet here 
""
We are talking about one magnet 
""
Uhm  ?
""
""
north pole of the magnet that is the geographical south is attracting 
magnetic north pole 
""
And am I talking about two magnets or one magnet ?
""
""
One magnet 
""
""
Yes Divya ?
""
""
You are talking about one magnet
""
""
Only one magnet Jayanti ?
""
""
You are talking about two magnets
""
""
Which is the other magnet  ?
""
""
Earth is the other magnet
""
""
Yes our earth is the 
""
Our earth also behaves like a  magnet
""
Therefore  earth's
""
""
I am sorry
""
What is actually the north pole of the earth that is the magnetic
south pole  and what is in reality the north pole of the earth that is the
south pole of the magnet 
""
Okay let us go to the third property of magnet
""
Kavya  ?
""
Third property of a magnet 
""
Any property that you know 
""
Roopa  ?
""
""
Like poles repel each other
""
""
Like poles repel each other  and unlike poles attract each
other
""
Naveen what do you mean by like poles  ?
""
Please be seated 
""
What do you mean by like poles  ?
""
What is a pole  ?
""
Sachin  ?
""
What is a pole ?
""
""
End of a magnet  more power
than 
""
""
Miss miss the end of the magnet is uh  attracts the maximum
 it has maximum uh
""
""
Power of attraction 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rather you can say that pole is a place of maximum attraction
""
Don't say end 
""
The place in a magnet which has maximum power of attraction that is
called a pole 
""
How many poles are there Shruti  ?
""
""
There are two poles
""
""
Two poles are there
""
Mohit what are they  ?
""
""
North pole and south pole
""
""
North pole and south pole 
""
So there are two poles in a magnet
""
But when we bring two magnets together  how do they behave ?
""
Tripti  ?
""
When we bring two magnets together  ?
""
They attract each other 
""
How  ?
""
How do they attract each other  ?
""
""
They 
""
""
Okay  ?
""
Yes  ?
""
Girish  ?
""
Girish you try 
""
How do two magnets behave when we bring them together  ?
""
Divya  ?
""
Uhm
""
""
Likely poles repel and
""
""
Yes when we bring them together we will always find that
north and north will repel  and south of one magnet will attract the north
pole of the other 
""
So this is how they behave on coming together 
""
Then next property of a magnet 
""
Yes Ajay ?
""
""
The magnet is having maximum attraction at its poles
""
""
The magnetic attraction is greatest at its two poles  and
is lesser in the middle 
""
Have you ever heard about magnetic field  ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
 ordinary playground or a field
""
Have you heard of magnetic field  ?
""
Mahesh what is that ?
""
""
Earth is a magnet
""
""
Earth is a magnet 
""
So whole earth is a field  ?
""
""
No 
""
""
Field of magnet  ?
""
Anybody else  ?
""
Why don't you try  ?
""
Uhm 
""
Please sit down 
""
""
Because the earth behaves like a magnet
""
""
Because the earth behaves like a magnet
""
Ranjana  ?
""
""
The two ends of a magnet when uh rest against and when the
object enters the magnetic field it gets attracted to  that
""
""
It gets attracted to that 
""
So we can define magnetic field is that region upto which a magnet
can affect 
""
And that field is again limited one
""
It can't  a very long distance
""
That area upto which a magnet can exert its attraction  towards
the magnetic substance 
""
A smaller magnet has a small magnetic field  a huge magnet will
have a bigger magnetic field 
""
Similarly earth also has a magnetic field 
""
Next property of magnet which we have not discussed so far  ?
""
Yes Sanjeevani  ?
""
Any other property  ?
""
Deepti  ?
""
""
Magnet is called a loadstone
""
""
Loadstone is 
""
And magnets are basically made up of 
""
That is not the property 
""
Yes Asha  ?
""
""
In the  in a magnet
""
""
Yes why a bar of iron and a bar magnet they behave in a
different manner  ?
""
Why an iron bar is unable to attract another piece of iron  ?
""
If we just see the internal structure of a magnet  that is a
bar magnet and a bar of iron we do find  there is a difference
""
Why there is a difference  ?
""
Because of molecules 
""
The arrangement of molecules in a bar magnet and a bar of iron
they are totally different 
""
In case of  bar of
iron  ?
""
What change do you find in bar of iron and bar magnet  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Arrange in what  ?
""
Arrange in what fashion  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  ?
""
Pratap is not there  ?
""
Yes Avinash you try 
""
Please sit down 
""
What about the pattern of arrangement of molecules in both the
things ?
""
""
In iron the molecules are not arranged uh  in proper
manner 
arranged  in proper manner
""
""
What do you mean by that proper manner ?
""
""
 north of
""
""
""
Santosh don't play with it 
""
Okay let us try to analyse 
""
In case of bar of iron 
any manner they like  or zig-zag
arrangement 
""
But in case of bar magnet  the same molecules are arranged in a
line  in a line or in a row and that too with all their north poles
facing one side  the other side
""
Therefore we find maximum attraction  on one side of the
magnet due to all north facing domains are on one side  all south facing
domains are on the other side 
""
Now what are these domains ?
""
These domains are nothing but  the other name for the molecules
""
""
Why a magnet gains the property of attraction ?
""
This is because of a specific arrangement of  its domains or
molecules  in a particular fashion
""
They are all arranged in a row that attributes or that gives the
property 
""
Now if by some force or some artificial means if we can arrange
those molecules  ?
""
Mohit  ?
""
Can we change a bar of iron into a magnet by  making the
molecular arrangement  ?
""
""
By making it same
""
""
Same  ?
""
How can we do so  ?
""
""
By rubbing 
""
""
By rubbing 
""
How this rubbing should be done  ?
""
Santosh you can try  ?
""
Santosh  ?
""
A bar of iron with a magnet and get  ?
""
""
Rub straight
""
""
What do you mean by  ?
""
Triveni  ?
""
""
We should rub in the same direction
""
""
No we should begin with one pole and start rubbing the magnet
 again start
rubbing it and lifting  rubbing and lifting the magnet
""
magnet 
""
What do you call this kind of magnet ?
""
A permanent magnet or a temporary magnet  ?
""
Please be seated 
""
What do you call this kind of magnet you have made by rubbing  ?
""
Prabhakar  ?
""
Yes Hemant you try ?
""
""
Temporary
""
""
We call it a temporary magnet 
""
Abhay what do you mean by temporary magnet  ?
""
""
A temporary magnet is a magnet  uh loses its
property after sometime  but the moment uh
""
""
Gradually lose their arrangement power or they 
get again the same  zig-zag they get arranged in the zig-zag manner and
they lose it 
""
What are permanent magnets  ?
""
What are permanent magnets  ?
""
""
They do not lose 
""
""
They do not lose
""
They also lose their  a very very
long period of time
""
Yes Harish ?
""
""
""
""
""
Permanent magnets are magnets which  the
power after many years and uh like they 
""
""
Okay  are those which lose their
power after a long period of time 
""
Have you heard about electro-magnets ?
""
""
Yes
""
""
Yes
""
""
What are electro-magnets  ?
""
How can we make electro-magnets  ?
""
Jayanthi  ?
""
""
Electro-magnet is passed through electricity 
""
""
Yes if we take any metallic wire and  some how pass
electricity through it  all over
it  gains the property
of  and it starts attracting pieces of iron
""
That is  when we pass electric current through a piece of the
metal 
electro-magnets
""
Yes Harish ?
""
""
Generally  we make electro-magnets with the instrument of
iron
""
""
Generally we make electro-magnets with the help of iron 
by coiling copper wire on iron
""
""
Formulate the electro or uh the 
""
""
That is if we wrap  wire on aluminium yes that
can also be converted into electro-magnet 
""
Can you just yes Ranjana  ?
""
""
Electro magnet is one which 
""
""
Yes you are  this kind of
electro-magnet we can convert big big pieces into magnet 
quick purpose 
""
But in case of rubbing you have to have  very big magnet and
again  it is
possible only with the help of small piece of blade or a safety pin or a 
small object 
""
But when we want to make big magnet  electro-magnets are used
 in many other places
""
So that is the best method  though it is again a temporary
""
The moment we switch off electric current  again the same
piece of iron 
""
No more a magnet
""
""
Miss can we make uh  one or two
words 
""
""
No no we can't 
""
Only iron we can rub and convert it into temporary magnet 
""
Now what are the uses of magnet  ?
""
What are the uses of magnet in our daily or day-to-day life  ?
""
Vikas  ?
""
""
Magnets are used in the boxes and uh  electric current
""
""
In pencil boxes for what purpose ?
""
""
For 
""
""
Yes for closing the box 
""
We need not put much of effort just leave it  because of the
attraction it get tightly  closed
""
Yes Divya  ?
""
""
In door
""
""
In 
""
""
Door
""
""
Door
""
They are also used as door closers automatic door closers
""
You leave the door  because
of attraction  the door gets closed
""
In  stuck to it
because of the magnetic force 
""
Ravi  ?
""
""
In the dia diaphragm
""
""
Diaphragm of a speaker and in 
""
Next Santosh  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Speak loudly 
""
It is used by navigators in order to know  the direction and
for that matter they use  magnetic needle or
magnetised needle  watch like thing we call it a
compass 
""
With the help of this compass needle they can come to know the
direction in which they are  moving
""
So they help the navigators to know  the direction in which
they are sailing or moving 
""
Ranjana  ?
""
""
In iron factories
""
""
Yes in iron factories where lot of scrape iron is produced
due to 
""
That scrape iron can again be melt  melted and re-used
therefore  to pick up that scrape iron from the land or from the soil or
from the broken pieces  cranes fitted with the magnet
which can 
""
Mahesh  ?
""
Girish ?
""
""
Magnet is used in referigerator
""
""
They are used in refrigerators I have told
""
Kavya  ?
""
""
In generators
""
""
In generators for what  ?
""
""
Miss miss 
""
""
Let her answer
""
Yes  ?
""
Electricity 
""
Have you read it somewhere  in
generating electricity 
""
Yes Kavya  ?
""
Have you read it somewhere  ?
""
I don't think anywhere we are using magnets to generate
electricity 
""
Ravi ?
""
What do you say  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Where  ?
""
""
In generator 
""
""
That is where  ?
""
""
In the middle of copper wire 
""
""
That day also he has told us  that in the middle of the
copper wire we put a  magnet
""
Then  ?
""
""
""
""
""
By the copper wire and thats how it is transmitted 
""
So we are generating electricity but we are unable to  tell
where and how  ?
""
You must know
