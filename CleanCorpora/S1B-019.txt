<I>
Okay please be seated 
Kindly sit down 
 Haan I know
I know 
Dipti will you be sitting here ?
Not I
Okay now you take this seat 
That is not better
That is not good
Better you have your seat here 
No I will not sit 
Close the door One or two words 
Shakil don't play with handkerchief 
Okay what I intend to do today yesterday whatever I have taught you
regarding magnet that we will begin today once again 
Instead of giving class work to you today I will repeat the same
 thing 
Okay let us start with magnetism
What is magnetism ?
Ravi ?
What is magnetism ?
Magnetism is uh magnets attract
Magnet attracts attracting pieces of iron is called
magnetism
Ajay ?
So the magnet is called as a substance which attracts uh
which has the quality of attracting other substances to it 
Other substances do you mean non-magnetic also ?
Iron is one or two words 
Who attracts iron nickel cobalt ?
Magnet 
Magnet
So this force of attraction of magnet towards magnetic
substances is called magnetism or magnetic force 
So we begin with magnetism 
What are the properties of a magnet ?
Avinash ?
Properties of a magnet 
Yes Avinash I am talking to you 
Uhm don't raise your hands uhm ?
Magnet attracts iron
Magnet always attracts iron and also magnetic substance is
called load-stone nickel cobalt and some varieties of steel 
What is the second property Vikas ?
A freely suspended magnet always comes to rest pointing north
direction
What is a freely suspended magnet ?
Subhash Subhash ?
 What what do you mean by freely
suspended ?
Mahesh ?
The magnet is tied to a string and is left to suspend
We will have to take a stand tie it with a thread and 
hang it and just move it 
It will go on moving go on rotating for some time and after that
 it will come to rest that is always the same direction called north
and south 
Now this north pole of the magnet is actually the south pole of the
 earth
The south pole of the magnet is actually the north pole of the
earth
Can you tell me why ?
Ranjana ?
 Why why are they different ?
Because unbalanced pole of the suspended and right pole of
the 
But we have only one magnet here 
We are talking about one magnet 
Uhm Harish ?
 I'm telling south pole of the earth is attracting 
north pole of the magnet that is the geographical south is attracting 
magnetic north pole 
And am I talking about two magnets or one magnet ?
One magnet 
Yes Divya ?
You are talking about one magnet
Only one magnet Jayanti ?
You are talking about two magnets
Which is the other magnet ?
Earth is the other magnet
Yes our earth is the collection of magnetic substance 
Our earth also behaves like a magnet
Therefore what is actually real north pole is the earth's
 south pole and what is actually 
I am sorry
What is actually the north pole of the earth that is the magnetic
south pole and what is in reality the north pole of the earth that is the
south pole of the magnet 
Okay let us go to the third property of magnet
Kavya ?
Third property of a magnet 
Any property that you know 
Roopa ?
Like poles repel each other
Like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each
other
Naveen what do you mean by like poles ?
Please be seated 
What do you mean by like poles ?
What is a pole ?
Sachin ?
What is a pole ?
End of a magnet which attracts more more power
than 
Miss miss the end of the magnet is uh attracts the maximum
 it has maximum uh
Power of attraction that is called a pole 
 A pole 
Rather you can say that pole is a place of maximum attraction
Don't say end 
The place in a magnet which has maximum power of attraction that is
called a pole 
How many poles are there Shruti ?
There are two poles
Two poles are there
Mohit what are they ?
North pole and south pole
North pole and south pole 
So there are two poles in a magnet
But when we bring two magnets together how do they behave ?
Tripti ?
When we bring two magnets together how do they behave ?
They attract each other 
How ?
How do they attract each other Shilpa ?
They A few words 
Okay anybody else ?
Yes ?
Girish ?
Girish you try 
How do two magnets behave when we bring them together ?
Divya ?
Uhm
Likely poles repel and
Yes when we bring them together we will always find that
north and north will repel and south of one magnet will attract the north
pole of the other 
So this is how they behave on coming together 
Then next property of a magnet 
Yes Ajay ?
The magnet is having maximum attraction at its poles
The magnetic attraction is greatest at its two poles and
is lesser in the middle 
Have you ever heard about magnetic field ?
Yes ma'am 
 What's just like ordinary playground or a field
Have you heard of magnetic field ?
Mahesh what is that ?
Earth is a magnet
Earth is a magnet 
So whole earth is a field ?
No 
Field of magnet ?
Anybody else ?
Why don't you try ?
Uhm 
Please sit down 
Because the earth behaves like a magnet
Because the earth behaves like a magnet
Ranjana ?
The two ends of a magnet when uh rest against and when the
object enters the magnetic field it gets attracted to that
It gets attracted to that 
So we can define magnetic field is that region upto which a magnet
can affect or can exert its power of attraction on the object 
And that field is again limited one
It can't extend to a very long distance
That area upto which a magnet can exert its attraction towards
the magnetic substance that is called magnetic field 
A smaller magnet has a small magnetic field a huge magnet will
have a bigger magnetic field 
Similarly earth also has a magnetic field 
Next property of magnet which we have not discussed so far ?
Yes Sanjeevani ?
Any other property ?
Deepti ?
Magnet is called a loadstone
Loadstone is magnetic substance 
And magnets are basically made up of loadstone only 
That is not the property 
Yes Asha ?
In the one or two words in a magnet
Yes why a bar of iron and a bar magnet they behave in a
different manner ?
Why an iron bar is unable to attract another piece of iron ?
If we just see the internal structure of a magnet that is a
bar magnet and a bar of iron we do find there is a difference
Why there is a difference ?
Because of molecules 
The arrangement of molecules in a bar magnet and a bar of iron
they are totally different 
In case of ir bar ir bar of
iron what do you find ?
What change do you find in bar of iron and bar magnet ?
 A few words 
Arrange in what ?
Arrange in what fashion ?
 A few words 
Uh that boy Pratap ?
Pratap is not there ?
Yes Avinash you try 
Please sit down 
What about the pattern of arrangement of molecules in both the
things ?
In iron the molecules are not arranged uh in proper
manner uh in magnet it's it is arranged 
arranged in proper manner
What do you mean by that proper manner ?
 That's north uh north uh north north of
Santosh don't play with it 
Okay let us try to analyse 
In case of bar of iron the molecules are arranged in a 
any manner they like that is hap-hazard arrangement or zig-zag
arrangement 
But in case of bar magnet the same molecules are arranged in a
line in a line or in a row and that too with all their north poles
facing one side and south poles facing the other side
Therefore we find maximum attraction on one side of the
magnet due to all north facing domains are on one side all south facing
domains are on the other side 
Now what are these domains ?
These domains are nothing but the other name for the molecules
Why a magnet gains the property of attraction ?
This is because of a specific arrangement of its domains or
molecules in a particular fashion
They are all arranged in a row that attributes or that gives the
property of attraction to a magnet whereas a bar of iron lacks it 
Now if by some force or some artificial means if we can arrange
those molecules can a bar of iron be changed into a magnet ?
Mohit ?
Can we change a bar of iron into a magnet by making the
molecular arrangement ?
By making it same
Same how ?
How can we do so ?
By rubbing by rubbing 
By rubbing 
How this rubbing should be done ?
Santosh you can try ?
Santosh how can we rub a magnet ?
A bar of iron with a magnet and get get an another magnet ?
Rub straight
What do you mean by straight ?
Triveni ?
We should rub in the same direction
No we should begin with one pole and start rubbing the magnet
 and then again lift it and again bring the same pole again start
rubbing it and lifting so by repeated rubbing and lifting the magnet
 we can also convert a piece of blade or a bar of iron into a 
magnet 
What do you call this kind of magnet ?
A permanent magnet or a temporary magnet ?
Please be seated 
What do you call this kind of magnet you have made by rubbing ?
Prabhakar ?
Yes Hemant you try ?
Temporary
We call it a temporary magnet 
Abhay what do you mean by temporary magnet ?
A temporary magnet is a magnet which uh loses its
property after sometime but the moment uh
Gradually lose their arrangement power or they are 
get again the same zig-zag they get arranged in the zig-zag manner and
they lose it 
What are permanent magnets ?
What are permanent magnets Sachin ?
They do not lose 
They do not lose
They also lose their property but after a very very
long period of time
Yes Harish ?
 A few words 
Permanent magnets are magnets which lose the the
power after many years and uh like they 
Okay permanent magnets are those which lose their
power after a long period of time 
Have you heard about electro-magnets ?
Yes
Yes
What are electro-magnets ?
How can we make electro-magnets ?
Jayanthi ?
Electro-magnet is passed through electricity 
Yes if we take any metallic wire and some how pass
electricity through it by coiling around an electric wire all over
it we find that same ordinary piece of metal gains the property
of attraction and it starts attracting pieces of iron
That is when we pass electric current through a piece of the
metal it becomes a magnet and such magnets are referred to as 
electro-magnets
Yes Harish ?
Generally we make electro-magnets with the instrument of
iron
Generally we make electro-magnets with the help of iron 
by coiling copper wire on iron
Formulate the electro or uh the 
That is if we wrap alumin wire on aluminium yes that
can also be converted into electro-magnet 
Can you just yes Ranjana ?
Electro magnet is one which a few words 
Yes you are you are right but this this kind of
electro-magnet we can convert big big pieces into magnet for our 
quick purpose 
But in case of rubbing you have to have very big magnet and
again rubbing will take a very very long time and it it is
possible only with the help of small piece of blade or a safety pin or a 
small object 
But when we want to make big magnet electro-magnets are used
 in many other places
So that is the best method though it is again a temporary
The moment we switch off electric current again the same
piece of iron becomes an ordinary thing 
No more a magnet
Miss can we make uh other metal from the one or two
words 
No no we can't 
Only iron we can rub and convert it into temporary magnet 
Now what are the uses of magnet ?
What are the uses of magnet in our daily or day-to-day life ?
Vikas ?
Magnets are used in the boxes and uh electric current
In pencil boxes for what purpose ?
For 
Yes for closing the box 
We need not put much of effort just leave it because of the
attraction it get tightly closed
Yes Divya ?
In door
In 
Door
Door
They are also used as door closers automatic door closers
You leave the door because of attraction yes because
of attraction the door gets closed
In refrigerator also you leave it it gets stuck to it
because of the magnetic force 
Ravi ?
In the dia diaphragm
Diaphragm of a speaker and in motors 
Next Santosh ?
 A few words 
Speak loudly 
It is used by navigators in order to know the direction and
for that matter they use a special type of magnet magnetic needle or
magnetised needle that is fitted in a watch like thing we call it a
compass 
With the help of this compass needle they can come to know the
direction in which they are moving
So they help the navigators to know the direction in which
they are sailing or moving 
Ranjana ?
In iron factories
Yes in iron factories where lot of scrape iron is produced
due to cutting or due to sawing of the bars 
That scrape iron can again be melt melted and re-used
therefore to pick up that scrape iron from the land or from the soil or
from the broken pieces we make use of cranes fitted with the magnet
which can go on collecting this scrape iron 
Mahesh ?
Girish ?
Magnet is used in referigerator
They are used in refrigerators I have told
Kavya ?
In generators
In generators for what ?
Miss miss 
Let her answer
Yes for generating what ?
Electricity 
Have you read it somewhere that magnets are used in
generating electricity 
Yes Kavya ?
Have you read it somewhere ?
I don't think anywhere we are using magnets to generate
electricity 
Ravi ?
What do you say ?
 A few words 
Where ?
In generator 
That is where ?
In the middle of copper wire 
That day also he has told us that in the middle of the
copper wire we put a magnet
Then ?
 A few words 
By the copper wire and thats how it is transmitted 
So we are generating electricity but we are unable to tell
where and how ?
You must know where and how it is being generated
