sensational debut of the year

Two  for dedicated
contribution to cinema  and of course the twelve popular awards finalised

Firstly to arrive at a set of five nominations  under each
category  were asked
to vote

The top five under each category was then presented  to an all
India panel of judges

By now you must be familiar  with the list of nominees under
each category 
immediately after the polling forms

They did not know  or who

and judges opinion
