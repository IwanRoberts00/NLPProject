<I>
 St's college from Madras university and yet 
still deciding on what topic we would like to talk on 
I am Padma doing my Ph D here in literature teaching
I am Srilata doing my Ph D here 
I am Subalakshmi doing PGM here 
I am Swarnalatha doing by MA in English literature 
I am Ramkumar doing my M Phil in English literature 
I am Louis doing my MA here 
Well we have decided to talk uh on women's 
liberation to begin with and we may move on to other topics later 
What do you think of women's liberation Louis 
 Women's liberation is basically uh a noble
concept but but the whole question is the ball is actually in the
 women's court I would say 
If I think woman should be a lot more assertive then what they
are now 
And I think they are allowing themselves to be more
conditioned than it is more that they condition themselves then men
conditioning them 
I object to what Louis said 
No doubt question of the woman being conditioned the society
which plays a major role in fact the society doesn't give a woman a
chance to prove her abilities 
She sort of repress and any attempt of a woman to liberate
herself is met is met with strong disapproval 
So I think the ball is in the men's court because 
No but somehow I think you are contradicting yourself in
some ways 
Uh as you said it's not actually men or women 
that's not the question at all
You yourself said that it is the society that controls
Society made both men and women 
So uhn I think we when we talk of women's liberation
we immediately the association is that it is anti-men 
Uh I would like to question that definition first 
No but India is mostly a patriarchal society
So it's men who play a more important role right in
all your decision making and what about this however modern we may
get to but still the same 
We haven't broken up from our ancient roots 
 That's what we call 
I would like to object to the first statement that she made
 that society conditions a woman 
I don't belive in society as such
I think the individual is superior to society 
I don't understand why uh individual should allow society to
dominate over his his or her individuality 
So the question of women's liberation is not that 
society suppresses a woman 
It is just that the woman refuses to do anything that
could alleviate her suffering 
I think the speaker is talking about about an utopian
society which can never exists 
Because the individual is very much a part of the society
He can't alleviate himself from the society 
What I feel is only the education and the economical
status makes a woman to feel very liberated 
So every woman must be educated and must be employed 
Then only they can be free taking decisions
Economically they will feel so 
What do you feel about it 
Well I feel uh now uh we have been given equal chances
with men and uh almost in all uh position even women are have
been working 
I mean only thing we have to utilise the chances properly and
 get into proper positions and make woman come up somewhere
Educate them basically and then make them also come up and
 be one with men 
I totally disagree that the women they are not taking up
any initiatives 
See for the last two or three decades as or so we find that
women they've reached a real good status to over the men
 in each and every field that they have participated 
Say now we find that that women they
are given a voice 
They are given a platform rather to voice their own opinions
 in each and every field be in press be in writing fiction 
writing poetry they have come up in a great way
But don't you think that that is more an exception than a rule
How many women assert themselves 
If you take an average Indian woman you take an average Indian
woman I think the Indian woman does not think more than marriage
and settling down in life 
An Indian women's ultimate objective in life is to marry
and settle down
 You take you take an educated Indian
woman in a Indian society
She might have done her MA or Ph D but what is ultimate
objective she wants to get married 
This marriage is the ultimate ideal of society or an individual
It cannot be this
No but marriage is just a part of uh life
you know but when we're getting ourselves educated there is no point
sitting at home as such doing Ph D's and all that hey
you can just sit with your BA or 
 No that is not the opinion of 
 That's what I'm saying it's 
more an exception than a rule 
It is more an exception than a rule 
Perhaps a few of you who are doing a Ph D think that way 
How many come to the MA classes by the way 
No no this is the situation I mean it's bad
 but the situation seems to have taken a change over the
past
 I challege that 
 They've but far to far to gradual to have
any any impact on society
But I still feel that there is a percent of change 
As she said our's is a patriarchal society and to
move away from the patriarchal society it takes some time
 It's not so easy 
Exuse me you are talking about marriage it's necessary
you do because there is no sec security for a single woman 
She is not respected that's a fact
No but I think his point was 
 I I'm not I'm not advocating
 uh I'm not advocating a woman being a spinster okay 
 You've got me wrong 
I am not trying to say that 
But what I'm I am only taking the exception to a 
woman's ultimate objective being marriage 
That is wicked of the society that's what 
I've been trying to tell you
No but I have one question to ask what is you 
 Why should it be why should it be 
You you have been educated you should learn to be independent
Now one second 
But who gives that kind of notion that that's going to be
your objective 
 It's a mother it's a father it's a
brother at home
Yeah
Or you know you you are taught even when a child is born 
look at all that the advertising that we listen to 
The bank says you save save money for your son's 
education and save for your daughter's marriage 
 Marriage 
You are talking 
So its there
You you are talking you're talking of
conditioning of a person okay 
A person an ess essential an individual
An individual should assert himself
No that as you say is a very utopian concept
No no I I strongly disagree 
 Because an individual can not exist 
Please do not dismiss it as a utopian I strongly disgree
with that view 
It is not utopian
 It's very much practical only we refuse to be
practical that is all
What you say a woman should does not talk about it don't look
at her objective point of her
I am not I'm not being objective 
Good going I think we'll have a change in the
topic now uh we will talk of the examination system uh to which all
of us are agreed to 
Yes why don't you begin 
Exam system what do you feel that uh you are getting
your rights the exam present kind of exams
No ma'am I feel examination should be abolished
I mean at specially at your graduate under graduate level 
post graduate level 
I mean they don't help the students in any way 
Infact they sort of hamper the pleasure one receives
from learning 
You don't learn for pleasure you learn for marks 
So it should be done away
Does everyone subscribe to this view
What would you like to say Ramkumar
No what I still feel is there should be some way in
which the lecturer should be in a position to gauge the performance of the
students
And one good way is examination 
But what I still feel is the continuous assessment system 
will work out in a better way rather than having a three hour examination
Yeah 
Say at the fag end of the session to evaluate the students
No don't you think uh that the question of a teacher
 gauging a students performance is utilatarian 
That is a high utilitarian concept you are prostituting knowledge
No not at all 
How do you claim
Why why do you want to gauge a students performence 
students knowledge you learn a few words 
 A few words 
 You've to place a student where 
where he stands 
 That's equally important because at the higher
studies 
 As I feel 
As I feel that is what I am saying it is a highly utilatarian
concept
You want to test the students so that you know whether you sit
for this whether you sit for this whether you sit for this 
 That's it 
Whether he is qualified for any promotion or not will
have to be determined by the lecturer 
Listen examinations don't don't examinations
really do not uh speak of their real ability as such 
Your abilities are quite different from what you something
that you take for harassment 
 Well I am 
 That's about the evaluation system 
Yes one shade of the ability is that the lecturers 
they test when they evaluate the students 
 What you know is from the nature 
 Whether from a guide simply use it
He may not really get the spirit of 
 That's not I mean to say 
The continuous assessment system is far better of than having
an examination at the end of the year or at the end of couple of
years
No no there so many problems in continuous
assessment that have come out now
 Even if the 
I don't think students really feel confident 
 It's again putting them into a kind of uh modern
slavery to the department concerned 
And that has also been uh pointed out by many and
not every teacher can be really made objective 
 No what I really wanted is to make the 
objective elements of the teacher comes into play then 
But what I still feel is you've different means and
methods by which you can evaluate the students to continue the assessment 
You can say introduce a seminar pattern the panel
discussion group discussion ask the students speak out in class 
regularly and then assess the student instead of asking him to sit
for a three hours examination 
And then assess him on that basis 
 Yeah in comparision yes
In comparision yes 
No but uh when you are taking a seminar or something
like that no one or two students from the class only uh read the
others you cannot say all of them are listening in the class
No he should have been given a topic to the before
the class 
 I mean but when you are asked I mean when you
are asked to write an exam all of us have to write
No each one of the student is asked to present a
paper 
 Should be given then
Yeah obviously 
But then we have other uh difficulties as well 
Say the class strength is massive you can't uh expect
each and every student to present in a seminar 
Or ask each and every student to participate in a group discussion
Especially in general English classes where the strength is
over seventy 
So the case is whether examination should be conducted at all
 or they shouldn't be conducted at all 
Now I suppose we've boiled down to that level
No that's a basic question
But ultimately in practice I think it is used more as a screening
 for employer to select
You know they give prescribe qualifications and that
provide the kind of uh screening for them 
Know some kind of uh proof that they have selected somebody
with certain certain qualification
Yeah its very
Whether that qualification really uh matters and
whether it really gives them the skills that are necessary for the job is not
all
Yeah only for government coughs employment 
But when you go to the pr private sector it so
happens that they have their own means and methods of testing the
students 
See normally they take for example if it's going to
be a salesman's job what they do is they have a group
discussion they have an interview
No even then there is a basic qualification
Basic qualification is always there 
Some where somehow somewhere you'll have to 
scren screen test 
 Screen 
But do we always feel that uh you know uh we are a mixed
ability group normally in the classroom 
Uh with different backgrounds and all all that
 I've always felt that uh the differentiation between
a mediocre student and a good student never really emerges from the
system that we have at present 
You now the ma it is very marginal 
The difference is very marginal 
I don't know how uh you react to it 
 It's a maybe we're more
interested in having a national syllabus
And merging each and every type of institution into one 
like the CD CIS Tamil Nadu state
No that is structuralising knowledge you can't we can't
accept that 
That is that is something very 
Rigid 
Yeah 
You can't structuralise something and say you compartmentalise
 you can't compartmenatalise knowledge it's unethical
Because you don't give license no you don't give 
give a student access to other branches of knowledge when you
compartmentalise knowledge
 Give license 
This is not compartmentalising knowledge what you mean to say
is that see we've different systems as the central board of
secondary education ICSE then we've the state board
Each and every state having its own uh curricular like
you know or syllabi 
Now once you merge have one syllabus for each and
 for every student who studies in India then may be we were in
better position to evaluate students performence 
No but Ramkumar what what you find in the syllabus is not
a guarantee to what is done in the classroom
