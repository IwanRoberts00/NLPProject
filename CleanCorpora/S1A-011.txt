I am Srilata doing my Ph D here 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well we have decided to talk 
""
""
What do you think of 
""
""
 a noble
""
""
""
""
are now 
""
""
conditioned than  men
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No but somehow I think you are  contradicting yourself in
some ways 
""
""
that's  not the question at all
""
You yourself said that it is the society that controls
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh I would like to question that definition first 
""
""
No but India is mostly a  patriarchal society
""
So  in
""
get to but still the same 
""
""
""
""
""
""
I would like to object to the first statement that she made
""
""
I don't belive in society as such
""
""
""
I don't understand why  uh individual should allow society to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
""
""
Economically they will feel so 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
any initiatives 
""
""
""
""
""
Say now  women they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How many women assert themselves 
""
If you take an average Indian woman  you take an average Indian
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
objective 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sitting at home as such doing  hey
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How many 
""
""
""
""
past
""
""
""
""
""
 have
""
""
""
""
""
As she said  to
""
""
""
""
""
Exuse me  necessary
you do 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I've  been trying to tell you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You you have been educated  you should learn to be independent
""
""
Now one second 
""
""
""
""
""
brother at home
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
education 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No no I 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What you say a woman should does not talk about it don't look
at her objective point of her
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
your rights  the exam present kind of exams
""
""
""
""
""
""
post graduate level 
""
""
""
Infact they sort of hamper the  receives
""
""
You don't learn for pleasure you learn for marks 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
will work out  in a better way rather than having a three hour examination
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is a high utilitarian concept you are prostituting knowledge
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
where 
""
 at the higher
""
""
""
""
""
As I feel  that is what I am saying it is a highly utilatarian
concept
""
You want to test the students so that you know  whether you sit
for this whether you sit for this whether you 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Listen  examinations
""
""
""
that you take for harassment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
they test 
""
""
""
""
""
 simply use it
""
He may not 
""
""
""
""
""
an examination  or at the end of couple of
""
""
""
""
assessment that have come out now
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh modern
""
""
And that has also been  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
But what I still feel is  different means and
""
""
You can  the panel
""
""
for a three hours examination 
""
And then assess him 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No but  taking a seminar or something
""
""
""
""
""
the class 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But then we have other 
""
""
each and every student to present in a seminar 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But ultimately in practice I think it is used more as a screening
 to select
""
""
""
""
""
with certain  certain qualification
""
""
Yeah its very
""
""
Whether that qualification really  and
""
all
""
""
Yeah only for government 
""
""
""
students 
""
""
""
""
""
""
No even then  there is a basic qualification
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ability group normally in the classroom 
""
""
""
 the differentiation between
""
""
""
""
""
The difference is very marginal 
""
I don't know how uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
compartmentalise knowledge
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
secondary education ICSE  the state board
""
""
""
""
Now once you merge  for each and
""
better position to evaluate students performence 
""
""
""
""
