still deciding on what topic we would like to talk on 
""
""
I am Padma doing my  in literature teaching
""
""
""
I am Srilata doing my Ph D here 
""
""
I am Subalakshmi doing PGM here 
""
""
I am Swarnalatha doing by MA in English literature 
""
""
I am Ramkumar doing my M Phil in English literature 
""
""
I am Louis doing my MA here 
""
""
Well we have decided to talk 
liberation to begin with and we may move on to other topics later 
""
What do you think of 
""
""
 a noble
concept but  the ball is actually in the
""
""
If  I think woman should be a lot more assertive then what they
are now 
""
And  more
conditioned than  men
conditioning them 
""
""
I object to what Louis said 
""
No doubt question of the woman being conditioned  the society
which plays a major role in fact the society doesn't give  a woman a
chance to 
""
She sort of  repress and any attempt of a woman to liberate
herself 
""
So I think the ball is in the 
""
""
No but somehow I think you are  contradicting yourself in
some ways 
""
Uh as you said 
that's  not the question at all
""
You yourself said that it is the society that controls
""
Society made both men and women 
""
So uhn  liberation
we immediately 
""
Uh I would like to question that definition first 
""
""
No but India is mostly a  patriarchal society
""
So  in
all your decision making and  however modern we may
get to but still the same 
""
We haven't broken up from our ancient roots 
""
""
""
""
I would like to object to the first statement that she made
""
""
I don't belive in society as such
""
I think the individual is superior to society 
""
I don't understand why  uh individual should allow society to
dominate over his 
""
So the question of 
society suppresses a woman 
""
It is just that the woman  that
could alleviate her suffering 
""
""
I think the speaker is talking about  about an utopian
society 
""
Because the individual is very much a part of the society
""
He can't alleviate himself from the society 
""
""
What I feel is  economical
status makes a woman to feel very liberated 
""
So 
""
Then only they can be  taking decisions
""
Economically they will feel so 
""
""
What do you feel about it 
""
""
Well I feel  been given equal chances
with men  have
been working 
""
I mean only thing we have to utilise the  chances properly and
 woman come up somewhere
""
Educate them basically and then  come up and
""
""
""
I  totally disagree that the women they are not taking up
any initiatives 
""
See for the last two or three decades as  we find that
women  a real good status to over the men
""
""
Say now  women they
are 
""
They are given a platform  rather to voice their own opinions
""
writing poetry they have come up  in a great way
""
""
But don't you think that that is more an exception than a rule
""
""
How many women assert themselves 
""
If you take an average Indian woman  you take an average Indian
woman I think the Indian woman  marriage
and settling down in life 
""
An Indian  ultimate objective in life is to marry
and settle down
""
 an educated Indian
woman  in a Indian society
""
She might have done her MA or Ph D  but what is ultimate
objective 
""
This marriage is the ultimate ideal of society  or an individual
""
It cannot be  this
""
""
No  uh life
you know but when  getting ourselves educated there is no point
sitting at home as such doing  hey
you can just sit with your BA or 
""
""
""
""
""
""
more an exception 
""
It is more an exception than a rule 
""
Perhaps 
""
How many 
""
""
No no this is the situation  bad
 over the
past
""
""
""
""
""
 have
any  any impact on society
""
""
But I still feel that there is a percent of change 
""
As she said  to
move away from the patriarchal society  it takes some time
""
""
""
""
Exuse me  necessary
you do 
""
She is not respected  a fact
""
""
No but I 
""
""
 not advocating
""
""
""
""
I am not trying to say that 
""
But what 
woman's 
""
""
That is wicked of the society 
I've  been trying to tell you
""
""
No but I have one question to 
""
""
""
""
You you have been educated  you should learn to be independent
""
""
Now one second 
""
But who gives that kind of notion that  going to be
your objective 
""
 a
brother at home
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Or you know you you are taught even when a child is born 
look at all that the advertising that we listen to 
""
The bank says you save 
education 
""
""
""
""
""
You are talking 
""
""
So its there
""
""
You you are talking  talking of
conditioning of a person okay 
""
A person an  essential an individual
""
An individual should assert himself
""
""
No that as you say is a very utopian concept
""
""
No no I 
""
""
""
""
""
Please do not dismiss it as a utopian  I strongly disgree
with that view 
""
It is not utopian
""
 only we refuse to be
practical  that is all
""
""
What you say a woman should does not talk about it don't look
at her objective point of her
""
""
I am not 
""
""
Good going  have a change in the
topic now  uh to which all
of us are agreed to 
""
Yes why don't you begin 
""
""
Exam system what do you feel that  uh you are getting
your rights  the exam present kind of exams
""
""
No  examination should be abolished
""
""
I mean at specially at your 
post graduate level 
""
I mean they don't help the students in any way 
""
Infact they sort of hamper the  receives
from learning 
""
You don't learn for pleasure you learn for marks 
""
So it should be done away
""
""
Does everyone subscribe to this view
""
What would you like to say Ramkumar
""
""
No what I still feel is  some way in
which the lecturer should be in a position to gauge the performance of the
students
""
And one good way is examination 
""
But what I still feel is 
will work out  in a better way rather than having a three hour examination
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Say at the fag end of the session to evaluate the students
""
""
""
No don't you think  the question of a teacher
""
""
That is a high utilitarian concept you are prostituting knowledge
""
""
""
No not at all 
""
How do you claim
""
""
Why why do you want to gauge a students performence 
students knowledge you learn 
""
""
""
""
""
where 
""
 at the higher
studies 
""
""
""
""
As I feel  that is what I am saying it is a highly utilatarian
concept
""
You want to test the students so that you know  whether you sit
for this whether you sit for this whether you 
""
""
""
""
""
Whether he is qualified for any promotion or not  will
have to be determined by the lecturer 
""
Listen  examinations
really do not 
""
Your abilities are quite different from what you  something
that you take for harassment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes one shade of the ability is 
they test 
""
""
""
""
""
 simply use it
""
He may not 
""
""
""
""
The continuous assessment system  is far better of than having
an examination  or at the end of couple of
years
""
""
No no  in continuous
assessment that have come out now
""
""
""
""
""
I don't think students really feel confident 
""
 uh modern
slavery to 
""
And that has also been  and
not every teacher can be really made objective 
""
""
""
objective elements of the teacher comes into play then 
""
But what I still feel is  different means and
methods by which you can evaluate the students to continue the assessment 
""
You can  the panel
discussion 
regularly  instead of asking him to sit
for a three hours examination 
""
And then assess him 
""
""
 in comparision yes
""
""
In comparision yes 
""
""
No but  taking a seminar or something
like that no one or two students from the class only  the
others you cannot say all of them are listening in the class
""
""
No he should have been given a topic  to the before
the class 
""
""
 I mean when you
are asked to write an exam all of us have to write
""
""
No each one of the student  present a
paper 
""
""
 then
""
""
Yeah obviously 
""
But then we have other 
""
Say the class strength is  uh expect
each and every student to present in a seminar 
""
Or ask each and every student to participate in a group discussion
""
""
Especially in general English classes where the strength  is
over seventy 
""
So the case is  whether examination should be conducted at all
""
""
""
Now I suppose  that level
""
""
No  a basic question
""
But ultimately in practice I think it is used more as a screening
 to select
""
You know they give prescribe qualifications  that
provide the kind of uh screening for them 
""
Know some kind of  uh proof that they have selected somebody
with certain  certain qualification
""
""
Yeah its very
""
""
Whether that qualification really  and
whether it really gives them the skills that are necessary for the job is not
all
""
""
Yeah only for government 
""
But when you go to the  it so
happens that  they have their own means and methods of testing the
students 
""
See normally  going to
be a  they have a group
discussion  they have an interview
""
""
No even then  there is a basic qualification
""
""
Basic qualification is always there 
""
Some where somehow somewhere 
scren 
""
""
""
""
""
But do we always feel that uh  you know uh we are a mixed
ability group normally in the classroom 
""
Uh with different backgrounds and all  all that
""
 the differentiation between
a mediocre student and a  from the
system that we have at present 
""
You now the 
""
The difference is very marginal 
""
I don't know how uh 
""
""
 more
interested in having a national syllabus
""
And merging each and every 
like the CD CIS Tamil Nadu state
""
""
No that is structuralising knowledge you can't we can't
accept that 
""
That is 
""
""
Rigid 
""
""
Yeah 
""
You can't structuralise something and say  you compartmentalise
 unethical
""
Because you don't 
give a student access to other  branches of knowledge when you
compartmentalise knowledge
""
""
""
""
""
This is not compartmentalising knowledge what you mean to say
is that  as the central board of
secondary education ICSE  the state board
""
Each and every  like
you know or syllabi 
""
Now once you merge  for each and
 then may be we were in
better position to evaluate students performence 
""
""
No but Ramkumar what  what you find in the syllabus is not
a guarantee to what is done in the classroom
