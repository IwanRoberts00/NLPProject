Sir in this matter the prosecution has examined 
prosecution has examined in all five witnesses to prove the charge
 against the accused who is charged under section three nought two
 that is for committing the murder of his wife 
The presecution case in brief is that on eleventh of September
nineteen ninety-two at about four thirty there was a quarrel
 between the present accused and his wife 
The quarrel was on the ground that the accused wanted
 his wife to assist him in the job of his alleged job of
pick-pocketing
Joint venture
Joint venture 
And since she refused to do do that there was a quarrel
It has further that she poured kerosene on herself to teach a
lesson to him and the accused threw a lighted match stick on
her set her on fire 
Thereafter the accused goes away from that place and
this burnt lady is taken to the hospital by one of her
neighbours 
There the entire case is on circumstantial evidence in as much
as there is no direct eye witness in this matter 
Yes
The prosecution has relied upon dying declarations 
namely the first dying declaration made before the special executive
magistrate that is P W one 
Yes
Then the second dying declaration is in the form of
the F I R which is recorded by the officer and obtained her signature
Now since she is dead this F I R will become a dying
declaration 
And then the third dying declaration which should be oral 
is alleged to have been made to her mother who had gone 
immediately to the hospital on being informed about the alleged
incident 
 In Marathi 
The first dying declaration that is which is
alleged to have been made or have been accorded by the S C M that is
deposed by P W one who is the S C M himself who has stated that on
eleven nine ninety-two he recorded the dying declaration in K E M hospital at
about na eight p m 
That declaration was made by one Mrs Binaka Bakat who
is deceased in this particular matter 
She was in a possession to make her dying declaration 
He asked a questions and she replied 
Now if Your Honour takes a look at exhibit five which is the
dying declaration which is recorded by the S C M P W one it is in form
of question and answers 
Written in question an answer form and it bears the thumb
impression of this deceased 
It was after it was duly read uh recorded it was read over to
her and then her thumb impression is obtained 
Now it would be argued by my learned friend that there is
no endorsement of the doctor on the uh alleged dying declaration to
which my submission would be that P W three and P W four 
specially P W four who is the doctor who had first treated this patient 
has said that the patient was in a condition to speak 
That would show that the patient was never unconscious and
therefore coupled with that
P W number
P W number is four is Miss Ram who has 
treated this patient 
She she has deposed that the patient was conscious was
in a condition to speak 
Then sir if Your Honour sees the cross examination of P W one 
that is the S C M 
Sir a question has been asked to him that and he has answered
 I did not obtain permission in writing from the doctor before
recording this dying declaration 
But then no other questions have been asked to this S C M 
as to why he has not done it or was it his duty to do it 
Such questions have not been asked or no explanation has been
sought from the S C M regarding this fact 
The evidence of
The evidence of P W four
Yes yes P W four has also stated P W three has
also stated and
P W number three 
The doctor who has perform the postmortem 
He has given his opinion that with fifty-six percent superficial
burns the patient will be in a condition to speak 
Then
And if Your Honour sees the evidence of P W four fourth
line the pa the deceased Binaka Bakat had fifty to
fifty-five percent burn injuries 
The patient was in a condition to speak 
P W four in the examination in chief the fourth line 
Then the other most important witness to this fact would be 
P W two who is the mother of the deceased 
Who was had gone immediately to the
hospital on receiving the information and the deceased has told
her told her about the incident 
Then
Then sir
Was patient speaking to P W number two
Yes yes yes 
I will come to that evidence 
But P W one there is no suggestion to the S C M that the
patient was unconscious 
There is no suggestion or n no cross examination
to the effect that the patient was unconscious 
P W number one and
To P W number one yes
She herself told uh
Told her about the incident and as to how she got burnt
So there is no suggestion to P W two also 
Sir as far as P W number two is concerned her evidence is to
the effect that on eleven nine ninety-two at about four thirty she was in the
house 
At that time the accused came to her accused came to her 
that is P W number two who is the mother of the deceased 
Accused came to her told her about that her daughter is
burnt 
And then and then at that time accused told her that he
would bring money for medicine 
And then he does not come back to the hospital 
That is the conduct of the accused
He told that P W number two 
reported about the incident and asked her to bring money no no
 and
 He 
 Two that 
 No no 
He said that he would bring money 
He would bring money 
 Money to the hospital for medicine
But he does not come back to the hospital 
That is the conduct of the accused 
Yes
That Your Honour will find on P W number two page 
Your Honour will find it on the very first page paragraph one uh
sorry 
Yes 
Page the first page of uh P W number two 
paragraph three 
Your Honour has got on eleven nine 
P W number
Two that is Maibai 
Yes para
Para number three on eleven nine ninety-two at about four
thirty p m I was in my hut 
At that time accused came to me and informed me that your daughter
is burnt and he admitted her in a hospital 
I immediately came to K E M Hospital 
At that time accused told me that he would bring money for medicine
He did not return to the hosptal 
At that time my daughter was in a position to talk 
Now further 
Yes
The next page I asked her as how she sustained burn
injuries
She replied Accused was demanding money for uh drinking
alcohol 
She req refused to give money
to him 
He started beating her and told her to assist him in
pick-pocket business 
So that two words 
Yes so that will show
Her position she was in a position she had people talk
Yes 
Incident two so this is the second dying declaration 
Again again if Your Honour sees she noticed the burn
injuries on her part below the chest 
On page number first page itself on the first page last line
Earlier page
Your honour is seeing paragraph three the earlier
 earlier page earlier page 
The last line I noticed burn injuries on her part below the chest
That would show that this part is alright
There is no burn injuries and doctor are 
is when I come to that evidence I will point out to Your Honour
that those burns were superficial 
They are not those deep burns where the patient would be 
uh sort of coma or unconscious 
It is not the case 
Then this witness has also given the her in her evidence
 as to how this uh her daughter was burnt 
She has said that yes she poured kerosene on herself and
the accused throw lighted match stick 
There is no improvement if she wanted to improve she would have
said that the accused threw the kerosene and set herself on fire 
This is the most natural conduct of this witness of coming before
the court and deposing the truth 
The truth which has taken place and whi 
 which she has heard from the deceased 
Yes 
The cross examination is nothing much to the effect to
distort her evidence and there is no suggestion to her that
 the her daughter was unconscious 
Then
Then sir the next witness is P W three Doctor Ramesh
 Ba Bane who
performed the post mortem 
Yes 
He says that it was a case of homicided death 
Page uh paragraph two the very first line 
Due to burn injuries 
Then immediately the next line I noticed following
external in uh in uh injured injuries 
 on the dead body superficial to deep thermal burns over the uh
various parts 
Yes
Then internal examination fa noticed the
following injuries 
Cause of death was due to the complications following fifty-six
percent superficial to deep thermal burns 
Then the next next page would be i 
important that is I notice burn injuries over dead
body from the chest to abdomen 
The injuries were fifty-six percent burn injuries nerves ends
were damaged of the dead body 
In the given case though the patient sus 
sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn injuries she will
be in a position to talk 
Yeah 
Then the cross examination 
Even the patient sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn
injuries she can survive except if there is no toxamia developed 
In this case toxamia had developed 
Both the hands of the deceased were burnt 
I cannot say both palms of the patient were burnt or not 
That has been clarified by P W four 
In this case toxamia had developed 
Yes 
Yes
If no toxamia had developed she would have survived
Survived
Yes here he has stated that toxamia has developed 
Then the next witness is P W four Doctor Maya Ram 
 who was who's the doctor who
had first treated this deceased 
Then
She has stated as I pointed out the patient was in a
condition to speak the fourth line 
Yes
Then she has proved cer 
certain case papers of the indoor papers she has fairly stated
that certain papers should not conversant with the writing or 
she'll know does not know whose writing it is 
That portion has been marked X 
But the portion which she has said or which she had accepted 
uh it is written by the Registrar and there her signature or initials are
there 
So this doctor uh in the cross examination has stated in
the last line left upper limb had zero percent burn 
The last line 
Where ?
The right uh uh the line above that the right upper limb
of the patient have five percent burn injuries 
Sir this was asked with the purpose that the thumb impression
which is on the F I R the thumb impression which is on the dying
declaration because of suggestion was put to the S C M that that is not
then the thumb impression 
In order to uh support the defence story this question was
asked which the doctor has opined that there were no burns or zero
percent 
Therefore the thu thumb 
impression is of the deceased 
It is of her mark the S C M has obtained or the
Yes yes on the dying declaration
On the dying declaration
As well as on the uh F I R 
Yes 
Then we come to the evidence of P W five the 
investigating officer who has recorded the F I R and drawn the scene
of offence panchanama that is exhibit eight 
Now Sir he has stated that he was on duty then on
receiving the telephone message he he had left to K E M Hospital 
Thereafter he called the S C M that S C M recorded the uh 
dying declaration and then he himself again recorded her statement which
he has treated as an F I R where he has obtained the endorsement of
the Doctor that the patient was in a condition to speak 
That is exhibit fourteen given by Doctor Khubchandani
 
Doctor Khubchandani's e 
 endorsement has been proved through Doctor Ram P W
four who's conversant with the uh uh handwriting of Doctor 
Khubchandani 
It is endorsed by 
By P W four whose conversant with the handwriting and
signature of Doctor Khubchandani and who has stated whereabouts
of Khubchandani is not known 
Yes
Then sir on the F I R the endorsement is after the
 uh body of the F I R is written thereafter the endorsement is written
 to which the officer has given an explanation and that explanation is
on page eleven 
The Doctor was very much present while the complaint was being
recorded 
Since the Doctor was very much present while the complaint was
being recorded thereaf therefore I
have not obtained the endorsement of the outside of the complaint but at the
end of the complaint 
There is no challenge to that effect by my learned friend that
 this endorsement has been subsequently obtained to that effect
