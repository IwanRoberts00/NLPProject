Sir in this matter 
prosecution has examined in all  to prove the charge
 who is charged under section three nought two
""
""
The presecution case in brief is  that on eleventh of September
nineteen ninety-two  there was a quarrel
""
""
The quarrel was  the accused wanted
 job of his alleged job of
pick-pocketing
""
""
Joint venture
""
""
Joint venture 
""
And since she refused to do  there was a quarrel
""
""
It has further that  she poured kerosene on herself to teach a
lesson to him  a lighted match stick on
her 
""
Thereafter  and
this  by one of her
neighbours 
""
There the  entire case is on circumstantial evidence in as much
as there is no direct eye witness in this matter 
""
""
Yes
""
""
The prosecution has relied upon 
namely  the first dying declaration made before the special executive
magistrate that is P W one 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Then  is in the form of
the F I R  which is recorded by the officer and obtained her signature
""
""
Now since she is dead  a dying
declaration 
""
And then the third 
is 
immediately to the hospital  about the alleged
incident 
""
""
""
""
""
The  which is
alleged to have been made  that is
deposed by P W one who is the S C M himself  who has stated that on
eleven nine ninety-two he recorded the dying declaration in K E M hospital at
about 
""
That declaration was  who
is deceased in this particular matter 
""
She was in a possession to make her dying declaration 
""
He asked a questions 
""
Now if Your Honour takes a look at exhibit five  which is the
dying declaration which is recorded by the S C M P W one  it is in form
of question and answers 
""
Written in question an answer form  the thumb
impression of this deceased 
""
It was after it was duly read  uh recorded it was read over to
her 
""
Now  that there is
no endorsement of the doctor on the  to
which my submission would be that 
specially P W four who is the doctor who had first treated this patient 
has said that the patient was in a condition to speak 
""
That would show that the patient was never unconscious  and
therefore  coupled with that
""
""
P W number
""
""
P W number 
treated this 
""
She she has deposed  was
in a condition to speak 
""
Then sir if Your Honour sees the cross examination of P W one 
that is the S C M 
""
Sir a question has been asked to him that  and he has answered
 I did not obtain permission in writing from the doctor before
recording this dying declaration 
""
But then 
as to why he has not done it 
""
Such questions have not been asked  or no explanation has been
sought from the S C M 
""
The evidence of
""
""
The evidence of P W four
""
""
Yes  P W three has
also stated  and
""
""
P W number three 
""
""
The doctor who has perform the postmortem 
""
He has given his opinion that with fifty-six percent superficial
burns 
""
""
Then
""
""
And if Your Honour sees the evidence of P W four  fourth
line  had fifty to
fifty-five percent burn injuries 
""
The patient was in a condition to speak 
""
P W four 
""
Then 
P W two who is the mother of the deceased 
""
Who  gone immediately to the
hospital  has told
her told her about the incident 
""
""
Then
""
""
Then sir
""
""
Was patient speaking to P W number two
""
""
Yes 
""
I will come to that evidence 
""
But P W one there is no suggestion to the S C M  that the
patient was unconscious 
""
There is no suggestion  no cross examination
to the effect that the patient was unconscious 
""
""
P W number one and
""
""
To P W number one  yes
""
""
She herself told uh
""
""
Told her about the incident  and as to how she got burnt
""
""
So there is no suggestion to P W two also 
""
Sir as far as P W number two is concerned  her evidence is to
the effect that on eleven nine ninety-two at about four thirty she was in the
house 
""
At that time the accused came to her 
that is P W number two who is the mother of the deceased 
""
Accused came to her  daughter is
burnt 
""
And then  that he
would bring money for medicine 
""
And then he does not come back to the hospital 
""
That is the conduct of the accused
""
""
He 
reported about the incident and asked her to bring money  no no
 and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He said that he would bring money 
""
""
He would bring 
""
""
 for medicine
""
But he does not come back to the hospital 
""
That is the conduct of the accused 
""
""
Yes
""
""
That Your Honour will find on 
Your Honour will find it  uh
sorry 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Page 
paragraph three 
""
Your Honour has got on eleven nine 
""
""
P W number
""
""
Two 
""
""
Yes para
""
""
Para number three  on eleven nine ninety-two at about four
thirty p m I was in my hut 
""
At that time accused came to me and informed me that your daughter
is burnt 
""
I immediately came to K E M Hospital 
""
At that time accused told me that he would bring money for medicine
""
""
He did not return to the hosptal 
""
At that time my daughter was in a position to talk 
""
Now 
""
""
Yes
""
""
The next page  as how she sustained burn
injuries
""
She replied  Accused was demanding money for uh drinking
alcohol 
""
She  to give money
to him 
""
He started beating her  and told her to assist him in
pick-pocket business 
""
""
So that 
""
""
Yes  that will show
""
""
Her position  she was in a position she had people talk
""
""
Yes 
""
Incident two 
""
Again  she noticed the burn
injuries on her part below the chest 
""
On page number first page itself  on the first page last line
""
""
Earlier page
""
Your honour is seeing  earlier
""
""
The last line I noticed burn injuries on her part below the chest
""
""
That would show that  alright
""
There is no burn injuries 
is  when I come to that evidence I will point out to Your Honour
that those burns were superficial 
""
They are not those deep burns 
uh sort of coma or unconscious 
""
It is not the case 
""
Then this witness has also given  her in her evidence
""
""
She has said that  yes she poured kerosene on herself and
the accused throw 
""
There is no improvement if she wanted to improve she would have
said that the accused threw the kerosene and set herself on fire 
""
This is the most natural conduct of this witness of coming before
the court and deposing the truth 
""
The truth 
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
The cross examination is nothing much to the effect  to
distort her evidence  that
""
""
""
Then
""
""
Then sir the next witness is P W three  Ramesh
 who
performed the post mortem 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
He says that 
""
Page 
""
Due to burn injuries 
""
Then  I noticed following
external 
 the uh
various parts 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Then  noticed the
following injuries 
""
Cause of death was due to the complications following fifty-six
percent 
""
Then the next 
important  I notice burn injuries over dead
body from the chest to abdomen 
""
The injuries were fifty-six percent burn injuries  nerves ends
were damaged of the dead body 
""
In the given case though the patient 
sustained  she will
be in a position to talk 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Then 
""
Even the patient sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn
injuries 
""
In this case toxamia had developed 
""
Both the hands of the deceased were burnt 
""
I cannot say both palms of the patient were burnt or not 
""
That has been clarified by P W four 
""
""
In this case toxamia had developed 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Yes
""
""
If no toxamia had developed  she would have survived
""
""
Survived
""
""
Yes 
""
Then the next witness is P W four 
 the doctor who
had first treated this 
""
""
Then
""
""
She has stated as I pointed out the patient was in a
condition to speak 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Then she has 
certain  papers she has fairly stated
that 
she'll 
""
That portion has been marked X 
""
But the portion which she has said or which she had accepted 
uh it is written by the Registrar and there  her signature or initials are
there 
""
So this doctor  has stated in
the last line 
""
The last line 
""
""
Where  ?
""
""
The right  uh uh the line above that the right upper limb
of the patient have five percent burn injuries 
""
Sir this was asked with the purpose  that the thumb impression
which is on the F I R  the thumb impression which is on the dying
declaration  because of suggestion was put to the S C M that that is not
then the thumb impression 
""
In order to  uh support the defence story this question was
asked  or zero
percent 
""
Therefore the 
impression is of the deceased 
""
""
It is of her mark  the S C M has obtained or the
""
""
Yes yes on the dying declaration
""
""
On the dying declaration
""
""
As well as on the uh 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Then we come to the evidence of P W five the 
investigating officer  and drawn the scene
of offence 
""
Now Sir  then on
receiving the telephone message he he had left 
""
Thereafter he called the S C M 
dying declaration  and then he himself again recorded her statement which
he has treated as an F I R  the endorsement of
the Doctor that the patient was in a condition to speak 
""
That is exhibit fourteen  Khubchandani
""
""
Doctor 
 P W
four 
Khubchandani 
""
""
It is endorsed by 
""
""
By P W four  whose conversant with the handwriting and
signature of Doctor  and who has stated whereabouts
of 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Then sir  the endorsement is after the
 thereafter the endorsement is written
 and that explanation is
on page eleven 
""
The Doctor was very much present while the complaint was being
recorded 
""
Since the Doctor was very much present while the complaint was
being recorded  I
have not obtained the endorsement of the outside of the complaint but at the
end of the complaint 
""
There is no challenge to that effect  by my learned friend that
""
""
