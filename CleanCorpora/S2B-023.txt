In the recent elections 
Sociologists 
have become 
""
This is a welcome  rationalization
of social life  increasing
recognisation of the need  before certain
decisions are  future prospects
of a 
""
This is very important  the
size of the population 
crores 
""
And 
but we must ascertain  public opinion at regular intervals on a number of
issues 
""
Now 
for making decisions 
regarding implementation of 
due to 
""
We need  as to what
 concerning their
interests 
""
Of course elections are held 
the decision makers  what exactly is to be done under
""
 one
word 
""
In other words  more and more
important these days  before certain
policies are made 
""
And students of social sciences  especially those of sociology
 must know what social
surveys are 
""
Today we are going to discuss  the broad outlines of what social
surveys are 
""
In our social surveys  a representative sample of the
population  we want to make
""
""
They are interviewed 
""
The data  the representative sample of
the population is 
""
These tables are uhm  a report
is given 
""
When we want to do research on a topic  topic is
divided into aspects 
""
These sectors are further analysed into variables  and when we
want to do  we have first of all to identify the
relevant variables 
""
After identifying these variables  we have to do social surveys
""
""
That is social surveys are started 
releve 
in a problem have already been identified 
""
Social surveys are done 
or how small 
""
That is 
""
Then  the
relationship between  uhm
formulate  hypothesis
 as
also  uh and which of
these is to be rejected  and which of these can be modified in order to
come 
""
Now the question arises  ?
""
Let me explain it 
""
Suppose 
prevalent in uh 
""
This is our problem for analysis that is  social tensions in
India 
""
Now  dimensions or
aspects 
""
And these may be due to  factionalism
 another factor uh factor of social
tensions  inter-caste
rivalries 
""
Still another factor of social tensions  for example
""
""
Now 
inter-caste tensions  these can be said to
be the three factors  social
tensions in India 
""
Each of these factors  or can be
analysed into a number of 
""
And these variables  may be for
example  or
may be for example  mass media and so on and so forth
""
""
Therefore  and
factors can be further analysed into 
""
The task of social surveys is  after we have identified these
variables to find out their magnitude  and
if possible whether they are closely connected or not
""
The  participant
observation for this purpose 
""
And some others may use the  case study method for this purpose
""
""
Then social surveys are done  the
survey method is not suitable for ascertaining the cause and effect
relationship between variables 
""
For that 
perform experiments in order to ascertain the 
cause and effect relationship between variables and to say  uh certainly
that certain variables precede  invariably
""
the 
""
That is 
then  uh we must be able to produce evidence with the experimental method
that X  invariably precedes Y and X and Y cannot occur unless X occurs
""
""
In other words  the
experimental method which is used to ascertain the cause and effect 
relationship between variables  case
study method or the method of participant observation which is used to 
identify the relevant variables involved in a problem 
""
A social survey  uhm but then
 or the most important
method 
""
And  this is one of the several methods used in
social sciences 
""
Be sure this is  not the only method but the most
important method of social surveys 
""
As I said earlier  with the help of
a  or the universe under study
""
""
What do we do  ?
""
We  an interview
schedule  and either we
sent  to a representative sample of the
population properly selected by using statistical  we
go ourselves or send our  interviewers to interview these people on the
spot  with the help of an interview
schedule 
""
In the western countries 
more and more frequently more and more often 
""
But in India 
surveys can hardly be done  except
""
and the problem is such  that interviews with those uh who possess
telephones are 
""
In practice  with the help of
interview schedules 
""
A researcher  two
thousand uhm  known as
respondents 
""
Now  in a proper
manner 
""
Since  make general
statements  people what we have to do
is to ask them the same questions 
 that not only the wording
of the question is standardized  not only the sequence in which the
questions are asked is standardized  but also the situation in which these
uh  that
all the respondents all the persons being studied  have been asked the
same 
""
After the interviewers  have
filled in the interview schedules  these are sent back to the institution
""
""
The data from the interview schedules are coded on  code
sheets  or otherwise
transferred to a computer readable medium  uhm magnetic tape or
like a floppy disk 
""
These are fed into the computer 
""
The computer  and
prints out 
""
These tables are then uh  or by
applying certain statistical measures  like the Chi-square or several
other types of 
""
And then  are put
together 
""
The research report provides us  to the questions
 we started with
""
That is  to
which  as well as the
sponsor that is the person  or has
financed  made
it possible for the researcher  operations and take
all the trouble of  preparing the
research design  collecting the required data with the help of an
interview schedule  and uh
""
""
The research report  for
example  coming
elections  ?
""
In other words  more and more
important these days  before
certain policies are made and in order to implement  these decisions make
the implementation of these decisions  and
""
""
The survey method  the most important method of
social research
