In the recent elections we have seen that 
Sociologists are those people who forecast election results 
have become even more important than astrologers 
This is a welcome sign because it speaks of rationalization
of social life and a an increasing
recognisation of the need to ascertain public opinion before certain
decisions are made regarding the life and future prospects
of a number of persons living in a country 
This is very important in a country like India where the
size of the population is uh going to exceed a hundred 
crores soon 
And it is not enough that we have elections every five years 
but we must ascertain public opinion at regular intervals on a number of
issues 
Now decision makers require a lot of information 
for making decisions regarding planning of social change 
regarding implementation of accepted policies and moreover 
due to increasing democratisation of social life 
We need from time to time more and more data as to what
 people think on a number of issues concerning their
interests 
Of course elections are held every five years but then 
the decision makers must know what exactly is to be done under
 situations certain situations by doing social service or 
 resorting resorting to what they say is one
word or the measurement of public opinion 
In other words social surveys are becoming more and more
important these days uh in order to make decisions before certain
policies are made 
And students of social sciences especially those of sociology
 political science economics etcetera must know what social
surveys are and how they are done 
Today we are going to discuss the broad outlines of what social
surveys are and how they are done 
In our social surveys a representative sample of the
population or the universe uh about which we want to make
 general statement is taken 
They are interviewed in a proper manner 
The data thus collected from the representative sample of
the population is tabulated 
These tables are uhm interpreted and then a report
is given showing the results of the social survey 
When we want to do research on a topic this uh topic is
divided into aspects or dimensions or sectors 
These sectors are further analysed into variables and when we
want to do research in a subject we have first of all to identify the
relevant variables 
After identifying these variables we have to do social surveys
That is social surveys are started only if the 
releve relevant dimensions and variables 
in a problem have already been identified 
Social surveys are done in order to ascertain how big 
or how small the effect of these variables is 
That is what is the magnitude of these variables 
Then social surveys also enable us to ascertain the
relationship between these variables and also to uhm
formulate or to and to test uh hypothesis
 about the relationship between these uh uhm uhm variables as
also which of these hypothesis is to be accepted uh and which of
these is to be rejected and which of these can be modified in order to
come to certain conclusions with a known degree of confidence 
Now the question arises what a variable is ?
Let me explain it with uh an example 
Suppose we are doing research on social tension 
prevalent in uh many parts of India 
This is our problem for analysis that is social tensions in
India 
Now there can be several uh sectors dimensions or
aspects of social tensions in India 
And these may be due to the due to factionalism
 one factor of social tensions another factor uh factor of social
tensions may be uh religious inter-religious and inter-caste
rivalries 
Still another factor of social tensions may be for example
 uh widespread unemployment 
Now factionalism inter-religious and uh 
inter-caste tensions and thirdly unemployment these can be said to
be the three factors of the problem under study that is social
tensions in India 
Each of these factors is further composed of or can be
analysed into a number of variables 
And these variables may be for example age may be for
example gender may be for example rural urban background or
may be for example uhm exposure to mass media and so on and so forth
Therefore a problem can be analysed into factors and
factors can be further analysed into variables 
The task of social surveys is after we have identified these
variables to find out their magnitude their mutual relations and
if possible whether they are closely connected or not
The social anthropologists often use participant
observation for this purpose 
And some others may use the case study method for this purpose
Then social surveys are done but be sure that the
survey method is not suitable for ascertaining the cause and effect
relationship between variables 
For that we have to go beyond the survey method to 
perform experiments in order to ascertain the uhm relations 
cause and effect relationship between variables and to say uh certainly
that certain variables precede certain other variables invariably
 and some vari uh and the relationship between 
the these variables is asymetrical 
That is when we want to say that X is the cause of Y 
then uh we must be able to produce evidence with the experimental method
that X invariably precedes Y and X and Y cannot occur unless X occurs
In other words social surveys like between uh the
experimental method which is used to ascertain the cause and effect 
relationship between variables and on the other hand the case
study method or the method of participant observation which is used to 
identify the relevant variables involved in a problem 
A social survey cannot do all these things uhm but then
 the survey method is the grant trunk road or the most important
method or the raajpath of social research 
And it can uhm this is one of the several methods used in
social sciences 
Be sure this is the not the only method but the most
important method of social surveys 
As I said earlier social surveys are done with the help of
a representative sample of the population or the universe under study
What do we do ?
We formulate or we prepare a an interview
schedule or a questionnaire or an interview guide and either we
sent the questionnaire by post to a representative sample of the
population properly selected by using statistical criteria or we
go ourselves or send our interviewers to interview these people on the
spot in a face to face situation with the help of an interview
schedule or an interview guide 
In the western countries telephone surveys are being used 
more and more frequently more and more often 
But in India since many people do not own telephones 
surveys can hardly be done with the help of uh telephones except
 on a few problems where the upper middle class is being studied 
and the problem is such that interviews with those uh who possess
telephones are enough 
In practice most surveys are done with the help of
interview schedules 
A researcher uh sends his interviewers to say two
thousand uhm persons around the country these are known as
respondents and the interviewers ask them a number of questions 
Now an interview schedule has to be prepared in a proper
manner 
Since we have to make generalisations make general
statements about a large number of uh people what we have to do
is to ask them the same questions in the same situa 
 in the same sequence ensuing that not only the wording
of the question is standardized not only the sequence in which the
questions are asked is standardized but also the situation in which these
uh questions are asked is standardized so that we can be sure that
all the respondents all the persons being studied have been asked the
same question and not a slightly different question 
After the interviewers or the research assistants have
filled in the interview schedules these are sent back to the institution
 or the university department where the researcher is situated 
The data from the interview schedules are coded on uh code
sheets then these are punched on code cards or otherwise
transferred to a computer readable medium like a uhm magnetic tape or
like a floppy disk 
These are fed into the computer 
The computer enables us to process these data and
prints out uhm a number of tables 
These tables are then uh interpreted by inspection or by
applying certain statistical measures like the Chi-square or several
other types of statistical methods 
And then these interpretions pretations are put
together in the form of a research report 
The research report provides us answers to the questions
 we started with
That is uh the questions which are to to
which answers are needed by the researcher as well as the
sponsor that is the person who or the institution who have uh or has
financed the conducting of this uh survey and has uh made
it possible for the researcher to perform all the operations and take
all the trouble of going through from the process of preparing the
research design collecting the required data with the help of an
interview schedule processing the data analysing the data and uh
 uh writing the research report 
The research report may provide us answers as to for
example what is going to be the outcome of the coming
elections ?
In other words social surveys are becoming more and more
important these days uh in order to make decisions before
certain policies are made and in order to implement these decisions make
the implementation of these decisions easier and and
 so on and so forth 
The survey method is as I said the most important method of
social research
