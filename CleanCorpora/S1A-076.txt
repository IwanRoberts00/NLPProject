So you had  education where
""
""

Oh mine I told you  my village is very small and we had
education only upto fourth standard

So then after fourth standard when I was nine years so  I had to
go to a nearby town Taluka place
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
So  that is about five kilometres everyday
we used to walk in the morning and return back in the evening like 
that 
""
And sometimes 
fifth standard sixth standard seventh standard eighth standard like that 
""
So all of us together 
 stay there
""
And turn wise  everday some persons were coming back to village
and collecting our tiffin and bringing there 
""
So that kind of living
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it was of course  sort of cooperative
""
""
Oh yeah yeah 
""
""
Living together 
""
""
No it is very funny  my life
""
""
So uh  I I cannot forget it

After finishing your secondary education 
""

Uhm uh after secondary education  the college was uh
available only  in Bagalkot
""
""
Uhm

So that was about thirty miles away from my place
""
""
Uhm

""
So 
""
And another place was Dharwar 
""
So Dharwar was bit away  I did my

""
""
""
""
And where did you stay in Bagalkot
""
""
Bagalkot uh  I I had
felt home sickness
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So only because of for the first time I left my family  and
all that 
""
So in fact  I didn't want to continue my college and I wanted to
go back 
""
And I went back to my village 
""
And then my father was so much interested in education  though
he was uneducated 
""
And he wanted me to educate 
""
And uhm  I was okay and I was considered to be somewhat
intelligent and as well as  so my mother actually came with me
 and for one year she stayed with me
""
""
She stayed with you yeah
""
""
And  so after one year
passed you know afterwards I  acquainted with with the
""
""
""
""
""
Got  to living in Bagalkot
""
""
""
""
""
Then then I started staying in some 
pri 
""
""
Okay

And basically we are agriculturists 
""
And my middle brother he was a school master 
""
And very recently he retired as a head master of a  primary
school
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And my two sisters they are married to some uh  village
people and they are alright after all 
""
""
Did you do your M Sc also from Bagalkot
""
""
No there

""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So I had to go to 
""
""
There also you stayed in the hostel 
""
""
Yeah I stayed  uh in the hostel
""
""
And immedietly after your M Sc you  took up teaching
""
""
""
 so
there was  for some of the students they
used to give 
""
Uh that minor research we used to call 
""
So in the second year of M Sc I was given  a piece of research
work and I was assigned to one Professor Dr Rajgopal
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh so I worked with him 
""
And uh  in that year I came in very close contact with Dr
Rajgopal 
""
So after completing my M Sc I joined Dr Rajgopal sir for Ph D 
""
""
Do you get any scholarship for doing 
""
""
""
to start with 
""
And after two years I got this U G C fellowship 
""
And then after completing my Ph D  I stayed in nineteen
sixty-seven I got my Ph D degree 
""
And I stayed there  uh since I was married at the age of
twenty-one only  uh
because she was almost ailing
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And uh so 
 otherwise I would have gone to some other place outside
the state Poona like that 
""
Uhn so  after uhm after getting my Ph D in nineteen sixty-seven
I got  senior fellowship C S R senior
fellowship  another I I T senior fellowship from Kanpur
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I would have gone to Kanpur and made a very good career 
but uh because of marriage I couldn't go 
""
So I had to
""
""
Stay 
""
""
""
""
And for two years I was there sixty-seven to sixty-nine as a 
two words 
""
And later on you know with great difficulty because  I'm
 I
entered the university as a demonstrator 
""
And three years I was a demonstrator
""
Then with great difficulty I  Lecturer's
""
""
And I was sent to Gulbarga 
""
And after that I had no problem
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah on your own
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And 
""
""
Uh  this is my third visit to Kolhapur
""
And uh 
""
And once uh  to participate in a conference which was organised
by the chemistry department of this university
""
And now this is third time 
""
""
Do you understand Marathi 
""
""
A little bit 
""
Because uh 
the Bombay Karnataka
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So  there are quite a number of people speaking Marathi
""
""
And uh as I know Hindi 
""
And so  there are many common words in Hindi and Marathi so I
can understand uh  Marathi
""
""
""
""
""
No how did 
""
""
So Hindi it was compulsory for us  in uh
""
""
In the school
""
""
Yes yes in the school
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And I passed the 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Out of my own  interest
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So  I felt I
should
""
""
You can read Hindi 
""
""
Oh yes sir
""
""
Means 
""
""
 Hindi also
""
""
So Marathi and Hindi 
""
""
Oh yes  I can read
Marathi without any problem
""
And I can understand also
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But uh 
""
""
Tell us something about Gulbarga 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
And how big is the city 
""
""
Gulbarga is quite big 
""
And it is a divisional place
""
And uh  three point
five to four 
""
And uh  uh uhm there in that part of
Karnataka uhm there is no  other big city
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And uh  and educationally
uhm  that is a very well developed this I can say
""
And there is a Medical college 
""
And there are two Engineering colleges 
""
And there are so many 
""
""
 government colleges
""
""
Yeah both of them are private colleges  and uh
""
""
And the Medical college also is a private college 
""
""
Medical college also a private college  and uh Engineering
college one of the Engineering college they started long back and it is 
uh I think it has got grant  though it is a private college
""
""
And there are several Pharmacy colleges 
""
And uh  college like that
educationally I think uh uhm 
""
""
When when was the  university in Gulbarga was established
""
""
Yeah it started as a post graduation centre in nineteen
seventy-one
""
""
Of 
""
""
""
""
And initially they started 
Kannada English uh  all
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And later in this nineteen seventy-two they added uh  some
more departments  this uh Mathematics
department were added 
""
So I went in nineteen seventy-two 
""
So we were uh
""
""
So Gulbarga has been a university for the last twenty-five
years
""
""
No no  upto eighty it was part of
Karnataka university as a post 
""
""
""
""
""
So only in nineteen eighty it became another university 
along with Mangalore university 
""
""
So Mangalore and uh 
""
""
 are of the same age
""
""
Were established as  same year
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah same year 
""
""
So  a only a fifteen years old university
""
""
Yeah fifteen years old 
""
""
Now  have departments
like uh 
Bio-technology
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
Sir we have  the the the
Master of Computer  uh uh I think M C A course
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So that is there and our Vice-chancellor since  he is the
uh person from Mathematics and Computer  so he our present Vice-chancellor
 and
M C A course is there
""
And we have got Bio-technology course also 
""
And uh Nuclear Physics  uh there is this department
""
And there is a separate Applied Electronics department 
""
So in Physics department  I don't think they have Nuclear
Physics 
""
So they have solid state physics and 
""
""
""
 how big are your Physics and Chemistry
departments 
""
""
Chemistry is very big
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So we have uh  about twenty-one staff members
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Twenty-one staff members 
""
And we are educating every years fifty students 
""
We have got five branches  Physical
 and Medical and Pharmaceutical
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And also for each branch we are admitting about ten students
""
""
So in all we are admitting fifty students 
""
So  fifty second
fifty 
""
 a very big department
""
""
And what is the procedure of admission in  Gulbarga
university 
""
""
Sir the admission procedure is uh  uh uhm
government type of procedure 
""
Sir we strictly go by merit and uh  one word
""
""
And uh we conduct the entrance examination 
""
So uh 
""
""
 even students from your own university
have to appear for the 
""
""
""
""
""
 and uh
""
""
""
""
""
Sir mostly you know the  post
graduate seats are  this uh students of affiliated
colleges
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Outside the university students hardly one or two seats will
be 
""
""
""
""
""
So most of the seats are for only  affiliated college
students 
""
So uhm immedietly after their undergraduate examination B A or B
Sc or B Com 
""
And uh  evolved a formula
""
""
Uhm
""
""
About seventy-five percent weightage is given to their  uh
first class degree 
""
And twenty-five percent weightage is given to  entrance
examination 
""
So both together we 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 list
""
""
And then  we
allot seats 
""
""
Is the medium of instruction 
English or Kannada
""
""
Uh as I know  there is no medium of
Kannada  in the
science
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And uh in Arts I think 
""
""
In 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
And uh students are allowed to write uh  uhm either in Kannada
or English
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And even in science also that provision is there 
""
But none of the students they write in Kannada 
""
""
 so they will answer in English
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
English 
""
And how many students in all are there in your university 
""
""
Uh I thought there
""
""
But it is not a constituent colleges
""
I am talking about  post graduate uh department
""
""
""
 uh
college uh  run by the university
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So  only the uhm the P G
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Uh courses are run by the university 
""
And I think uh  that must be somewhere around fifteen hundred
 uh students
""
I don't know the exact strength
""
""
Uhm
""
""
But it is uh  somewhere around fifteen to fifteen hundred
to two thousand 
""
So in that range
""
""
Yeah 
gives all the grants  and the U G C also gives the grants
""
""
Yeah  so
""
""
But  are there
other agencies which also fund the  in the university
""
""
""
 Hyderabad
Karnatak uh uh  uhm the the Karnataka state
in order to develop that Hyderabad karnataka
