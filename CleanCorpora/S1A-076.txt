<I>
So it's a kind of Marathi influence on me
So you had uh how did you begin your education where
Oh mine I told you my village is very small and we had
education only upto fourth standard 
So then after fourth standard when I was nine years so I had to
go to a nearby town Taluka place
Uhm uhm 
So three miles that is about five kilometres everyday
we used to walk in the morning and return back in the evening like 
that 
And sometimes so we were nearly twenty persons uh uh 
fifth standard sixth standard seventh standard eighth standard like that 
So all of us together we we were going to take a room 
 uhm and uh on rental basis stay there
And turn wise everday some persons were coming back to village
and collecting our tiffin and bringing there 
So that kind of living
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
So it was of course sort of cooperative
Oh yeah yeah laughter 
Living together 
No it is very funny so it enlightened my life
 in the primary and uh high school 
So uh I I cannot forget it
So 
 And after that 
After finishing your secondary education 
Uhm uh after secondary education the college was uh
available only in Bagalkot
Uhm
So that was about thirty miles away from my place
Uhm
So naturally I had to go to Bagalkot 
And another place was Dharwar 
So Dharwar was bit away so I had to go to I did my
this uh
 So you did it in Bagalkot 
And where did you stay in Bagalkot
Bagalkot uh in the beginning uh you know I I had
felt home sickness
Uhm 
So only because of for the first time I left my family and
all that 
So in fact I didn't want to continue my college and I wanted to
go back 
And I went back to my village 
And then my father was so much interested in education though
he was uneducated 
And he wanted me to educate 
And uhm I was okay and I was considered to be somewhat
intelligent and as well as and uh so my mother actually came with me
 and for one year she stayed with me
She stayed with you yeah
And that's how then uh so after one year
passed you know afterwards I became acquainted with with the
 Became 
Got accustomed to living in Bagalkot
 Accustomed 
Then then I started staying in some hostel and some 
pri private apartments like that 
Okay 
And how many brothers and sisters you have
Uh I have that uh two brothers 
So including me we are three 
And uh two sisters 
So I'm the youngest I am the youngest one
 Youngest 
Uhm
And uh my eldest brother is uh taking care of this uh uh
uh 
Agriculture 
Yeah 
And basically we are agriculturists 
And my middle brother he was a school master 
And very recently he retired as a head master of a primary
school
Uhm 
And my two sisters they are married to some uh village
people and they are alright after all 
Did you do your M Sc also from Bagalkot
No there M Sc cannot uh we in Karnataka you know 
the P G is only at the university centre
Uhm 
So I had to go to Dharwar for M Sc 
There also you stayed in the hostel 
Yeah I stayed uh in the hostel
And immedietly after your M Sc you took up teaching
 Yeah I uh in while doing M Sc so
there was uh uhm a special provision for some of the students they
used to give uh uhm uhm a a piece of research work 
Uh that minor research we used to call 
So in the second year of M Sc I was given a piece of research
work and I was assigned to one Professor Dr Rajgopal
Uhm 
And uh so I worked with him for minor research 
And uh in that year I came in very close contact with Dr
Rajgopal so I promised him to continue Ph D with him only 
So after completing my M Sc I joined Dr Rajgopal sir for Ph D 
Do you get any scholarship for doing the Ph D 
 Yeah I got uh C S R some two words 
to start with 
And after two years I got this U G C fellowship 
And then after completing my Ph D I stayed in nineteen
sixty-seven I got my Ph D degree 
And I stayed there uh since I was married at the age of
twenty-one only because my mother wanted to see me married uh
because she was almost ailing
Uhm
And uh so because of that I had to set up in Dharwar 
 otherwise otherwise I would have gone to some other place outside
the state Poona like that 
Uhn so after uhm after getting my Ph D in nineteen sixty-seven
I got three fellowships one U G C senior fellowship C S R senior
fellowship another I I T senior fellowship from Kanpur
 Uhm 
Uhm
I would have gone to Kanpur and made a very good career 
but uh because of marriage I couldn't go 
So I had to
Stay back in Dharwar 
 Stay in Dharwar yeah 
And for two years I was there sixty-seven to sixty-nine as a 
two words 
And later on you know with great difficulty because I'm
 coming from a agriculture background and no godfather so I
entered the university as a demonstrator 
And three years I was a demonstrator
Then with great difficulty I got a Lecturer's
 post 
And I was sent to Gulbarga 
And after that I had no problem
 I'm coming up from my own laughs 
 Lecturer 
Yeah on your own
Yeah 
And how many years you have been visiting Kolhapur 
Uh this is my third visit to Kolhapur
And uh once I came here for examination work 
And once uh to participate in a conference which was organised
by the chemistry department of this university
And now this is third time 
Do you understand Marathi 
A little bit 
Because uh i i it's uh I'm from 
the Bombay Karnataka
Uhm
So there are quite a number of people speaking Marathi
And uh as I know Hindi uhm which I can speak 
And so there are many common words in Hindi and Marathi so I
can understand uh though I may not speak uh in Marathi
 Uhm 
No how did how did you learn Hindi 
So Hindi it was compulsory for us in uh
In the school
Yes yes in the school
Uhm 
And I passed the Rashtrabhasa 
Uhm 
Out of my own interest
Uhm 
So since it's a national language I felt I
should
You can read Hindi 
Oh yes sir
Means you can read Marathi also 
 Yes Hindi I can read Hindi also
So Marathi and Hindi 
Oh yes script they are the same I can read
Marathi without any problem
And I can understand also
 As the one word same 
Uhm 
But uh speaking is a problem and uhm 
Tell us something about Gulbarga 
Uh Gul 
And how big is the city 
Gulbarga is quite big 
And it is a divisional place
And uh the population I think somewhere around three point
five to four lakhs 
And uh uhm because of this uh uhm there in that part of
Karnataka uhm there is no other big city
Uhm
And uh there are several colleges and educationally
uhm that is a very well developed this I can say
And there is a Medical college 
And there are two Engineering colleges 
And there are so many colleges 
 Private colleges or uh government colleges
Yeah both of them are private colleges and uh
And the Medical college also is a private college 
Medical college also a private college and uh Engineering
college one of the Engineering college they started long back and it is 
uh I think it has got grant uh this though it is a private college
And there are several Pharmacy colleges 
And uh Science colleges and Women's college like that
educationally I think uh uhm 
When when was the university in Gulbarga was established
Yeah it started as a post graduation centre in nineteen
seventy-one
Of Karnataka university 
 Karnataka yeah yeah Karnataka university 
And initially they started uh two or three departments 
Kannada English uh that's all
Uhm 
And later in this nineteen seventy-two they added uh some
more departments Chemistry department then uh this uh Mathematics
department were added 
So I went in nineteen seventy-two 
So we were uh
So Gulbarga has been a university for the last twenty-five
years
No no seventy to eighty upto eighty it was part of
Karnataka university as a post graduate centre 
 Centre uhm 
So only in nineteen eighty it became another university 
along with Mangalore university 
So Mangalore and uh Gulbarga 
 Yeah Gulbarga are of the same age
Were established as university in the same year
 Yeah in the same 
Yeah same year 
So it's a only a fifteen years old university
Yeah fifteen years old 
Now do uh does the university have departments
like uh Nuclear Physics or Computer Science yeah 
Bio-technology
 Yeah 
Yeah 
Sir we have uhm uh almost all departments the the the
Master of Computer uh uh I think M C A course
Uhm
So that is there and our Vice-chancellor since he is the
uh person from Mathematics and Computer so he our present Vice-chancellor
 he's invested lot of one word Computer Science and
M C A course is there
And we have got Bio-technology course also 
And uh Nuclear Physics uh there is this department
And there is a separate Applied Electronics department 
So in Physics department I don't think they have Nuclear
Physics 
So they have solid state physics and one word 
 How how big are your Physics and Chemistry
departments 
Chemistry is very big
Uhm 
So we have uh about twenty-one staff members
Uhm
Twenty-one staff members 
And we are educating every years fifty students 
We have got five branches Organic Inorganic Physical
 and Medical and Pharmaceutical
Uhm 
And also for each branch we are admitting about ten students
So in all we are admitting fifty students 
So that's a very and first year fifty second
fifty we have got quite a number of Ph D M Phil and P G students 
 It's a very big department
And what is the procedure of admission in Gulbarga
university 
Sir the admission procedure is uh almost uh uhm
government type of procedure 
Sir we strictly go by merit and uh following the one word
 system 
And uh we conduct the entrance examination 
So uh university 
 So even even students from your own university
have to appear for the entrance examination 
 Oh yeah definitely 
 Definitely and uh
 One word 
Sir mostly you know the the seats for uhm post
graduate seats are mainly allotted to this uh students of affiliated
colleges
Uhm 
Outside the university students hardly one or two seats will
be uh available for the year 
 Yes 
So most of the seats are for only affiliated college
students 
So uhm immedietly after their undergraduate examination B A or B
Sc or B Com sir we conduct the entrance examination 
And uh so we have evolved a formula
Uhm
About seventy-five percent weightage is given to their uh
first class degree performence 
And twenty-five percent weightage is given to entrance
examination 
So both together we uh prepare a merit list 
 Uhm 
 Entrance examination 
 Merit list
And then according to the one word system we
allot seats 
Is the medium of instruction at the graduate level 
English or Kannada
Uh as I know in the science uh there is no medium of
Kannada in uh in almost all colleges it will be only English in the
science
Uhm
And uh in Arts I think 
In one word and Arts it is Kannada 
 One word and Arts 
Yeah they use Kannada 
And uh students are allowed to write uh uhm either in Kannada
or English
Uhm
And even in science also that provision is there 
But none of the students they write in Kannada 
 They're since they are taught in English 
 uhm so they will answer in English
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
English 
And how many students in all are there in your university 
Uh I thought there
But it is not a constituent colleges
I am talking about the post graduate uh department
 Oh yeah so yeah we don't have any uh
college uh run by the university
Uhm
So only the uhm the P G
Uhm
Uh courses are run by the university 
And I think uh that must be somewhere around fifteen hundred
 uh students
I don't know the exact strength
Uhm
But it is uh somewhere around fifteen to fifteen hundred
to two thousand 
So in that range
Yeah and uh government of uh Karnataka 
gives all the grants and the U G C also gives the grants
Yeah so
But beside these two funding agencies are there
other agencies which also fund the programmes in the university
 Yeah there is one uh this Hyderabad
Karnatak uh uh development fund they have uhm the the Karnataka state
in order to develop that Hyderabad karnataka area so
