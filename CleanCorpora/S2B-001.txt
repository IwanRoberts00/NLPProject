The U S Secretary of State Mr Baker said that four Allies of the
Second World War should give serious consideration on issues relating to
German reunification 
But it is argued that this forum should take decisions only

It is our view that Germany must not be singled out 
Thus many issues of significance interest to us here 
we'll require consultation and decision in other more inclusive
forum

the international scene

reports 
If the development of art can be traced to the evaluation of
human consciousness then every object of art reflects a social mileau

 love for beauty and nature much of which he expressed through his
paintings 
Traditional styles of painting have withered the ravages of time

two category 
The hundred metre long track has speed breakers jumps and
obstacles 
The trasmitters of the participants had range of under hundred
feet 
And the participant guided his car from a specially
constructed platform 
But like all pioneering events this one to encounted problems
As for rules atleast six participants take part in one round of a
rally and a person who completes the maximum number of lapse in five
minutes is adjudged the winner 
But in this rally most of the transmitters had the same
frequency 
Therefore to avoid jamming of one participants car by another
 the format of the race had to be changed 
The participants ran their cars individually and the person
recording the fastest time for three lapse was adjudged the winner 
Before the actual rally a concourse was held to judge the best
maintained car 
With extra points the self assembled car 
At first sight it may looks like childs play

challenging as a regular car rally

point two and Bombay twenty-seven point two degrees celcius
