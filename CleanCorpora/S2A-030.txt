In English studies  module two
 teaching literature in English
 ?
""
What are the emergent areas in literature in English ?
""
What are the research possibilities  ?
""
So 
module three 
module three  research areas in English studies what are the new critical
tools evolved by the more recent critical method schools  ?
""
What are the trends in contemporary criticism  ?
""
What are the new approaches to research in linguistics stylistic
etcetera  ?
""
So it is hoped that some of the things that I  speak to you
about will 
""
Of the two lectures  auchitya
""
literary assessment 
""
Yesterday  listing the eight
major theories 
""
And the first of these 
rasa 
""
Today I am taking up 
""
""
I have a  a select
bibliography of books and articles on the application of  Indian literary
theory classical Indian literary theory 
 uh to modern writings
""
""
So you will get a list  I
won't be commenting on that list today  comment
on this yesterday we didn't have the  today we have
something which is not quite so black but  be able to use
that 
""
The 
which is like uh teaching science in the 
""
Imagine this is a test tube  because in the laboratory they
didn't have a real test tube  the work of
imagination 
""
But today I think I will  draw the diagram which is provided by
 that two
triangles  of
the eight 
""
Uh there are some college who would  theory to
the other theory  I have a attitude that each theory has its
own 
""
No single theory  will explain the
whole of the literary process 
""
And the relevance of the theory depends on how 
how critically 
""
What can a poor theory do 
imaginative enough to apply it 
""
So 
rasa 
anumiti waad 
""
These three are linked together  auchitya
""
""
That is without 
dhwani  anumiti
""
""
Everything has to be  that applies to
the application of any literary theory as well 
""
The blind application of any theory  help us in
appreciating or understanding or interpreting literature 
""
The smaller  guna
""
riti 
""
And I have given the  major critics who
have advocated this 
""
And linking  riti
 which will represent
""
""
For most of these translations are available in English but as I
said  their
kind of English  uh the translations may not satisfy
the requirements of 
""
But it is good if teachers of English can  take kindly to some
of these tools of research  in the complete
confidence that  we are free to interpret any theory we handle and we
ought to do that not merely 
""
So unless you breathe new life into these these are not going to
help us 
""
We have to deal with modern literature  we have to deal with
literature written in a foreign language 
""
And uh we have the gap of  atleast two
thousand years perhaps 
""
So we have to take these into account  and uhm what we get from
these texts is only the insights 
""
Some  by a people so long ago
 which in fact defies
understanding 
""
No  musician will explain to us everything about
his own art 
""
Musicians are most tongue tied in this you know you sit and listen
to me 
""
It is a musicologist who will talk about it  and he can do that
because his 
""
There are many things which cannot be 
which cannot be diverged which cannot be even apprehended by the performers
""
""
So  is an element of
mystery and we have  eight different ways of probing into the mysteries of
literary 
""
We will take up  theory
today  Sophocles
Edipus  which is cutting
across  not because the Greeks
had come here 
uh there is a common ground 
""
The humanist  certain
common grounds but you have to dig deep 
""
At the appropriate level you will find the connections  just as
we can discover that we are related to  way if
we go back 
""
The whole paper has been written out  uhm and you will get
copies 
""
So I will 
""
Now scholars from the time of Bharata  have been conscious of
this principle of 
""
It was Shemendra of the eleventh century  who devoted a whole
treaties  and thereby raised it to the level of a
basic requisite of all successful literary creations 
""
Bharata thinks of it as a principle that ensures  guna
""
doshas 
""
According to him the Bharata  auchitya
 of some kind or other might be responsible for any one of the ten
""
""
That doesn't mean that there are only ten blemishes or ten kinds of
blemishes 
""
Ten have been identified  uh list
all possible types of 
""
That we do in modern times also 
""
The concept of  is employed in Bharatas
prescriptions 
""
Although the word  might not have been
used by him 
""
In the same way Bharata then  Vamana Anandvasna
""
""
But it was left to Shemendra as I said the earlier  to project
the view that  and
that all other qualities will fail to have their effect if this principle is
ignored 
""
So  will
not work  he list them
all 
""
Shemendra has identified  twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects
or areas in which 
""
Now we must remember that these are  these texts have come to
us in a mangled form  and the works of many
scholars have totally disappeared 
abstract names 
""
Uh but what what has been saved or salvaged  gives us some idea
of what can be done with some of these tools 
""
These may be brought under five or six broad heads  these
twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects which he has listed  under names for
instance  list
of uh these items and their translations 
""
I think  English translations also you
know  is
called uh  at the discourse level
""
""
Then  guna
alankara  that is uh under metaphor
""
uh like  so
 if it
is in the wrong place 
""
On the other hand 
by itself  used with
""
""
Yesterday we pointed out that uh 
and uh  may
be considered  not in somebody
elses 
""
So there is a kind of  uh a justification on the basis of the
appropriateness of the whole thing to the 
""
Under  which is the major concern of
these uh  linga
vachana visheshana upsarga nibhava 
or uh words level  the appropriate
gender has to be used
""
I will  I will
comment on some of these 
""
Uh the use of number  use of adjective the use of preposition
 appropriateness
in all this grammatical features as well 
""
But perfect works are rare and therefore you will be able to 
identify violations of these  which is called
""
""
Under  as I said
yesterday  or
place 
""
And there  you can bring in all kinds of sociological criticism
""
""
If it doesn't  the particular class or race that is
presented in a work
""
For example if the  character the
woodsman character in a play  utterance
you know that will be inappropriate 
""
So  has to be observed in the
kind of characters that is presented 
otherwise it can violate
""
So there is a  sociological criticism to find
its way if this is expanded but unfortunately  uh it had not been done in
ancient India 
""
Then under the 
""
""
""
What is  ?
""
""
""
appropriate behaviour for that man you know
""
If a priest is presented as a character I think he has to 
conduct himself in that way 
""
That  I
think I have every right to use the ancestral property in my own way 
""
And uhm when I have the term 
that's  we
have to get at them implied meaning 
""
Literary criticism is also  interpretation of critical theories
not only 
""
Interpretation of critical works also has to be done  that is
what uh  when he
wrote 
dhavnyaloka  a
creative  Anandvardhana
 centuries until everything
seems to have stopped 
and that is the thread we have to pick up 
""
 to try
to do something which they have not 
""
Uh and the  Indian language teachers are also very reluctant to
do this 
""
They haven't done this apart from discussing the theory they don't
""
""
 discussed in the light of
some of these  we
have failed to do that 
""
And uh  pain you by saying that we haven't done
many of the things  the British were there and we
could not do 
""
An English teacher need not feel that English is the last vistage
of colonialism you know 
""
Teachers of English are not yet to perpetuate  uh western values
but they can  everything from the west provided they are
understood and absorbed into the system in which we operate 
""
Then uh  uh
 the level
of consciousness of  or the intention
 and characterisation which
 substance imagination situation
thought name in the naming of characters 
or benediction 
""
So in every aspect if you take a  you
will find examples of all these  and a a total interpretation of any
single play by using all these insights 
""
Now some of them may not be applicable 
every theory has its  and a theory survives
because of its acceptance of certain limitations 
""
If we recognise the limitation we can make use of it 
""
And uh if doesn't work  and not the
literary work 
""
A theory may not apply because  a theory is a very broad
generalisation 
""
And under  which are not totally listed
""
and  rabatra
 or theme
""
""
So uh if  develop
even as Shemendra 
study 
""
We could  and give it meaning
because 
""
And if you find any one of these not applicable to a 
particular work I think you can reject that or ignore it for the time being
that is how literary criticism is possible
