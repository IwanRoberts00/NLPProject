""
But today I think I will  draw the diagram which is provided by
 that two
""
""
""
Uh there are some college who would  theory to
the other theory  I have a attitude that each theory has its
own 
""
No single theory  will explain the
""
""
And the relevance of the theory depends on how 
how critically

scholars have totally disappeared 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
