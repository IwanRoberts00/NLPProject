In English studies there is unit module two
 unit two point two point three teaching literature in English
 what are the approaches to the teaching of literature in English ?
What are the emergent areas in literature in English ?
What are the research possibilities ?
So a a and also uh 
module three you have uh no I am sorry uh two point three 
module three research areas in English studies what are the new critical
tools evolved by the more recent critical method schools ?
What are the trends in contemporary criticism ?
What are the new approaches to research in linguistics stylistic
etcetera ?
So it is hoped that some of the things that I speak to you
about will inspire one or two to go along these lines 
Of the two lectures first uh on auchitya
 as a cri criterion of 
literary assessment 
Yesterday I distributed a handout listing the eight
major theories not the minor ones eight major theories 
And the first of these which is the most notorious 
rasa theory we discussed yesterday 
Today I am taking up what is listed there as number four 
 auchitya 
I have a for distribution a bibliography a select
bibliography of books and articles on the application of Indian literary
theory classical Indian literary theory to uh litera 
 literary works especially uh to modern writings
 uh which are available in English 
So you will get a list and uh you can you can choose I
won't be commenting on that list today but I shall like to comment
on this yesterday we didn't have the black board today we have
something which is not quite so black but we'll be able to use
that clearing the throat 
The BB writing these diagram I mention briefly 
which is like uh teaching science in the in some of the old colleges 
Imagine this is a test tube because in the laboratory they
didn't have a real test tube so everything was the work of
imagination 
But today I think I will draw the diagram which is provided by
 Kuppuswamy Shastri as I mentioned yesterday and uh that two
triangles and two circle indicate the relative importance of
the eight fold system 
Uh there are some college who would prefer one theory to
the other theory but I I have a attitude that each theory has its
own specific application 
No single theory not even from the west will explain the
whole of the literary process 
And the relevance of the theory depends on how liberally 
how critically how meaningfully we apply this theory 
What can a poor theory do if the user of the theory is not 
imaginative enough to apply it intelligently 
So we have the three major theories dhwani 
rasa and anumana or anumiti 
anumiti waad or anumanaya inference 
These three are linked together by auchitya
 
That is without auchitya neither 
dhwani nor rasa nor anumiti
 by itself can deliver the goods 
Everything has to be used in a proper way that applies to
the application of any literary theory as well 
The blind application of any theory will not help us in
appreciating or understanding or interpreting literature 
The smaller triangle guna a guna
 theory the alankara theory and 
riti theory these are of different schools 
And I have given the names of the people major critics who
have advocated this with the basic texts 
And linking guna alankara and riti
 we have the uh smaller circle which will represent
 vakrokti 
For most of these translations are available in English but as I
said translations were made by Sanskrit scholars who knew their
kind of English and therefore uh the translations may not satisfy
the requirements of teachers of English 
But it is good if teachers of English can take kindly to some
of these tools of research and develop them in the complete
confidence that we are free to interpret any theory we handle and we
ought to do that not merely borrow them wholesale 
So unless you breathe new life into these these are not going to
help us 
We have to deal with modern literature we have to deal with
literature written in a foreign language 
And uh we have the gap of thousands of years atleast two
thousand years perhaps 
So we have to take these into account and uhm what we get from
these texts is only the insights 
Some evidence of efforts made by a people so long ago
 to understand the literary process which which in fact defies
understanding 
No poet no musician will explain to us everything about
his own art 
Musicians are most tongue tied in this you know you sit and listen
to me I won't talk 
It is a musicologist who will talk about it and he can do that
because his mastery is comparatively limited 
There are many things which cannot be uh talked about 
which cannot be diverged which cannot be even apprehended by the performers
So ther there is an element of
mystery and we have eight different ways of probing into the mysteries of
literary creativity 
We will take up this auchitya theory
today and uhm I will try to apply it to Sophocles
Edipus Rex Edipus the king a Greek play which is cutting
across uh not only time but also space not because the Greeks
had come here at the time of the Chanakya serial but because 
uh there is a common ground 
The humanist outlook says that there must be certain
common grounds but you have to dig deep may not be on the surface 
At the appropriate level you will find the connections just as
we can discover that we are related to the Eskimos in some way if
we go back far behind in history clearing the throat 
The whole paper has been written out uhm and you will get
copies before it appears in some book 
So I will read it out with some comments here and there 
Now scholars from the time of Bharata have been conscious of
this principle of auchitya 
It was Shemendra of the eleventh century who devoted a whole
treaties to its discussion and thereby raised it to the level of a
basic requisite of all successful literary creations 
Bharata thinks of it as a principle that ensures guna
 or qualities and eschews or removes blemishes or 
doshas 
According to him the Bharata the violation of auchitya
 of some kind or other might be responsible for any one of the ten
 identified doshas 
That doesn't mean that there are only ten blemishes or ten kinds of
blemishes 
Ten have been identified because uh you can't uh list
all possible types of blemishes we categorise 
That we do in modern times also 
The concept of auchitya is employed in Bharatas
prescriptions for the successful staging of plays 
Although the word auchitya might not have been
used by him 
In the same way Bharata then one word Vamana Anandvasna
 have all recognised the importance of auchitya 
But it was left to Shemendra as I said the earlier to project
the view that auchitya is a fundamental principle and
that all other qualities will fail to have their effect if this principle is
ignored 
So rasa without auchitya will
not work that is called rasa auchitya he list them
all 
Shemendra has identified twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects
or areas in which auchitya can be perceived 
Now we must remember that these are these texts have come to
us in a mangled form parts are missing and the works of many
scholars have totally disappeared they are only remembered as 
abstract names 
Uh but what what has been saved or salvaged gives us some idea
of what can be done with some of these tools 
These may be brought under five or six broad heads these
twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects which he has listed under names for
instance pada vakya prabandha uh I have a list
of uh these items and their translations 
I think I'll read the English translations also you
know the the auchitya at the sentence level is
called uh vakya auchitya auchitya at the discourse level
 is called prabandharth auchitya 
Then we have items under kavya shastra guna
alankara and rasa that is uh under metaphor
 kavya shastra and under poetics we have certain items 
uh like rasa auchitya alankara auchitya guna auchitya so
 guna by itself will not be a guna if it
is in the wrong place if it is not used with propriety 
On the other hand what may be called a dosha 
by itself may become a guna if it is used with
 auchitya 
Yesterday we pointed out that uh jugupsa 
and uh bibhatsa which we find in uhm uhm Naipaul may
be considered gunas in his type of work not in somebody
elses kind of work 
So there is a kind of uh a justification on the basis of the
appropriateness of the whole thing to the literary context 
Under vyakarna which is the major concern of
these uh scholars we have pada kriya karaga linga
vachana visheshana upsarga nibhava and kala 
or uh words level verb level case gender the appropriate
gender has to be used
I will in my comment on uhm Sophocles play I will
comment on some of these 
Uh the use of number use of adjective the use of preposition
 the use of article use of tense there should be appropriateness
in all this grammatical features as well in a perfect work 
But perfect works are rare and therefore you will be able to 
identify violations of these auchitya which is called
 auchitya bhanga 
Under loktantra Shemendra lists as I said
yesterday desa kula and vrata or
place race and conduct 
And there you can bring in all kinds of sociological criticism
If it doesn't suit the particular class or race that is
presented in a work
For example if the nishada character the
woodsman character in a play speaks a high level Sanskrit utterance
you know that will be inappropriate 
So propriety or appropriateness has to be observed in the
kind of characters that is presented and that was the idea 
otherwise it can violate
So there is a chance for sociological criticism to find
its way if this is expanded but unfortunately uh it had not been done in
ancient India 
Then under the title under the section kavi 
 or the poet we have a tatva 
What is vrata vratasan ?
 Vrata is conduct behavior 
appropriate behaviour for that man you know
If a priest is presented as a character I think he has to 
conduct himself in that way 
That that's the meaning I give to it you know uh uh I
think I have every right to use the ancestral property in my own way 
And uhm when I have the term loktantra and 
that's kula and vrata I think we
have to get at them implied meaning 
Literary criticism is also interpretation of critical theories
not only critical works I mean creative works 
Interpretation of critical works also has to be done that is
what uh Abhinav Gupta did to Anandvardhana when he
wrote Lochana as a commentary on uh 
dhavnyaloka it's an explication it's a
creative expansion of the basic ideas of Anandvardhana
 which had continued for uh centuries until everything
seems to have stopped with Jagannath Pandit and Appaya Richir 
and that is the thread we have to pick up 
 It's very un palatable to English teachers to try
to do something which they have not done thirty forty years ago 
Uh and the Indian language teachers are also very reluctant to
do this 
They haven't done this apart from discussing the theory they don't
 seem to apply this to any modern novel 
 Premchand's novels could be discussed in the light of
some of these a total interpretation of Tagore is possible but we
have failed to do that 
And uh I am here to pain you by saying that we haven't done
many of the things and explanation is the British were there and we
could not do 
An English teacher need not feel that English is the last vistage
of colonialism you know 
Teachers of English are not yet to perpetuate uh western values
but they can accept everything from the west provided they are
understood and absorbed into the system in which we operate 
Then uh tatva satva we have the uh
 clearing the throat the the principles observed the level
of consciousness of satva abhipraya or the intention
 swabhava or character and characterisation which
 is becomes uh very important substance imagination situation
thought name in the naming of characters in aashirwad 
or benediction 
So in every aspect if you take a play for instance you
will find examples of all these and a a total interpretation of any
single play by using all these insights 
Now some of them may not be applicable to certain works 
every theory has its built-in limitation and a theory survives
because of its acceptance of certain limitations 
If we recognise the limitation we can make use of it 
And uh if doesn't work throw away the theory and not the
literary work this is the basic principle 
A theory may not apply because a theory is a very broad
generalisation it's only a model 
And under kavyangas which are not totally listed
 three have been uh identified patra prameya 
and sandarbha characterisation or rabatra
 or patra and prameya or theme
 and sandarbha or context 
So uh if a uh good interpreter of this theory can develop
even as Shemendra discussed this theory in a book one word 
study in the eleventh century 
We could elaborate each of these and give it meaning
because it's a part of a total scheme 
And if you find any one of these not applicable to a 
particular work I think you can reject that or ignore it for the time being
that is how literary criticism is possible
