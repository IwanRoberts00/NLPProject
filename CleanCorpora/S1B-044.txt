<I>
Newly elected A I A D M K member of parliament from
Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu Mr Shekhar is an advocate by profession and 
he's a party's district secretary 
Mr Shekhar welcome to our studio 
Thank you 
Tell us Mr Shekhar ah how do you 
attribute the right of regional po parties 
 in India's body politics 
 Ah 
You see in India there is uh plenty of languages 
and uh plenty of uh re regional 
 I just like that 
Even though in this uh type of uh our nation because we
 are having many differences and many communal individual parties
We refuse to save integration and to our India 
Then this is you see many peoples are there peoples living or
having many languages and uh many cultures like that 
This way the only regional parties which are reflecting the
 regional peoples culture and their uh uh cultures and their 
views through that regional parties only gain 
And so the regional party is having just a close relationship which
is basically with that uh people the regional peoples 
You know now-a-days you see that only the Congress have 
such much of approach to the uh uh throughout
national vein 
No other party is rather having that much of approach 
Anyhow our A I A D M K Anna D M K which is led by our 
puratchithalaivi Ms Jayalalitha or Madam 
Uh is having the party in uh yes and many states in Andhra
 Karnataka in Pondicherry as well as now in uh our capital
New Delhi itself 
So that not only the regional parties are developing in other
states our other regions 
Uh they're also having the confidence of the regional 
 pe peoples that uh they're 
reflecting that uh views and angles 
So only the regional parties can built the uh views and the
imagines or anything you've to take of the
peoples opinion 
Uh so uh the regional parties are in our country just like
our country democratical country we're giving the freedoms
to regional parties in one way
 In From another angle the regional
parties are uh uhm uh united itself and give a democratical set-up to our
nation
But do you think that regional parties have the same vision
 as the national party ?
Certainly because they're having the same
interest of uh uh national uh national parties interest 
You know that our M G R our beloved leader in the time of war
war time of China he donated he's the first it was the 
man who donated such a huge amount just like a thing it was more than a
 lakh uh to our late Prime Minister Pandit
 Jawaharlal Nehru 
He donated a huge amount
Nobody under at that time nobody 
donated such amount 
 Whereas he was in the regional party under this he
donated uh too much of high amount to our Prime Minister for integration
But do you think that the regional party is they you know
integrate the federal structure
Certainly because regional party is having the same view
on one word there
Reflecting there mo their culture their mother tongue
such like that but they want integration of the India 
 They've definitely work for it they've definitely
 uh stood in front for their integration of the country our nation 
But do you think that the rise of regional parties is a
temporary phenomenon or it is a permanent feature of our politics
 It's permanent uh feature
Because nobody can uh uh divert our divert the 
regional culture or regional languages you see 
So uh this is because this is biggest uh our nation 
have many languages and many regions 
So this is the permanent one
Nobody can uh uh that's why nobody can uh close
this angle 
This is the only thing only angle the permanent unity 
because whenever the regional parties have developed 
Then uh the national development no doubt at all 
Mr Shekhar you were I believe totally associated with the late
M G R who was a very charismatic leader
Yeah
Tell us something more about him
M G R is uh uncomparable leader 
He has fight fought for the poor people
and down downtrodden peoples 
Uh in not only his cine his film not only come through cine 
cine or such one word yes because he was a big donor 
Uh uh even though he was asked this he donated uh uh a huge
amount by his hard work 
Whatever he earned he donated all the money to the people
And after his death he donated the uh his wealth
to his people
Now-a-days it is said he donated his house and uh our
properties to the poor peoples 
Just when you see and that uh our Madam our Puratchi
 Jayalalitha uhm is true follower or the true leader after M G R
How is she carrying on the legacy of M G R 
Yes uh even those in the life life of M G R M G R chose
 that only Ms Jayalalitha she'll give the she'll 
be the future uh in your leader 
He uh put to our Madam in our propoganda secretary at a
propoganda secretary 
After M G R she's the true heir to M G R uh uh to
the party and had a beloved leader 
She placed uh now she's the only biggest leader 
from Tamil Nadu 
Uh 
But how is she ?
I mean how's she carrying on what M G R had done ?
In all political policies and political activities uh
see even though in M G R's life there is uh like this you see 
she was trained and she she was has come
through only by M G R
And M G R choose she'll be the successor for the party
And now uh uh that he is going has gone 
 she is doing you see all problems of uh by-elections and all other
things 
She is always with the poor people just like M G R
 She's fighting for the poor people for downtrodden people
 uh as in by election manifesto she has declared all things to the favour
and one word but without any other parties uhm see in the
election manifesto she gave one word sort of manifesto
It is prepared only for the poor people
I can see that you've pinned photograph of Ms
Jayalalitha yes any particular reason for that ?

That trains the students not only in political activities 
they must be after aw awareness of the

Now Karnataka Maharashtra Pondicherry benifitted
But the Tamil Nadu people those uh are are utilised its water
Majority uh must have their proper right because it's

Just as it enters and go to some other areas
But there're there is an hydel project where they
must uh our M G R and Devrajan the chief Minister of Karnataka have
discussed about putting a hydel project in one word a very big

also Ravindranath Tagore they always remembered him uhm uhm
And also uh as per the political relations they were

 Uhm uhm 
Do uh uhm did you feel that uh uh enough or at
least some people from Panama Costa Rica etcetera are also uh
visiting India as tourists or were they uh uh were they keen to acquire
 knowledge or information about India our country our culture ?
Yes actually after my uh turn there as ambassador
 Panama also sent a woman ambassador to India 
 Also during my time there was some uh uh there
were two ladies they were sent to India in this uh to be trained in
the institute of tute of mass communication
 One word 
I see I see 
Also I was enjoying my time 
Uh is it uh uh correct presumption that you were the
first uh person from Naga to have served in the Indian Foreign
Service ?
And to have been an ambassador representing our country ?
Yes in uh in Nagaland uh as far as Naga
 Nagaland is concerned I was the first one uh
still I am the first one from the Nagaland to join the Indian Foreign
Service
And how many years did you serve there ?
I think about twenty years
Oh then do you believe now that your years in the Foreign
Service have been rewarding for you ?
Well it was very interesting wherever I went I made
friends and specially for india 
And only that uh when I had gone to Brussels ah ha
 eh uh Rome and Washington D C and Shri Lanka 
 Ah ha 
I believe Miss Haralu that uh your board has a varied
activities 
Uh we would like to hear from you about some of your
activities projects initiatives in different areas 
You see we have a welfare extension projects 
And this projects have this projects have five centres
And you know in Nagaland we've seven districts 
And in six districts we have got these projects centres and
these are in border areas of Nagaland state
And for these areas you know because it has rural and remote areas
 so in in those centres we have a maternity and child welfare centres
we have put up 
And in these centres we have a dai and a
 gramsevika and one word instructor 
What are the activities you are engaged on these days
 ?
Uh we are mainly implementing the schemes of the centre
 central social welfare board
And these are uh social uh social social economic
programme 
There are for uh in that programme we extend uh financial
assistance to the some registered societies for piggery which is very
popular and weaving and knitting and dairy 
And uh we've other programmes like holiday home camps for
children for the tribal from the age of nine to fourteen years
And this is very also very popular 
Usually these are conducted in winter and uh the children
are encouraged in this uh in this those are mainly for four children or
four people you know
And then uh the purpose is to give them a chance to uh see
places and also conducting the camps for that to uh to develop 
leadership training like that 
And then uh we've one word course for those
women 
This mainly for the women who are the dropped 
drop outs uh from schools
Then we give them stipend for years year course or two
years course
Then we have vocational training for women for uh one or
two word of women and this is for to train them in tailoring uh
knitting or even typing and other vocational training so that they will be
able to get a self self-employment or a get some employment also
Now tell me uh something about uh uhm the status of
women in uh Nagaland uh particularly uh vis a vis men and your
interface with society 
And do do you think that uh the Naga women have progressed a
lot ?
And what are your hopes for the future ?
I think the when you uh think of in term of the
literacy rate the female literacy rate is very high 
Uh I think one of the highest one of the highest in think
in india also
And in Nagaland the women are given the girls are given
equal opportunity uh equal appoi appointment
 employment and also few of girls have almost reached it if
I consider top
Uh we have a couple of IAS officers 
And also in addition uh uh all the departments we have
directors like that
But still our rural women are in majority and I must say
that I am glad to say that this panchayat teer rajasthani
 and I think that they were </-. give a a real opportunity
to women because a women has two things we have not still
achieved that is inheritance and then women have no place in the 
 municipality or in the Assembly 
So I think that the panchayati raj will give
them a opportunity to come up in that
Because the deci decision 
making is they are not they are not involved in that and I think that
 to have a society uh uh a progressive society or developed
society we need a participation of cipation of the women also 
Uh what is your day like ?
Would you like to tell us 
Well first of all to tell you honestly I do begin
with a two cups of tea 
And then I start going to the garden because I love gardening 
Then gardening uh most of one word is done in the
morning after tea
And then uh I come in and may be I watch TV uh the the
news 
And after that may be sometime I cook 
Then I rush to get ready to go to the office 
And I go to the central welfare board 
I mean our our office uh in the town 
Then the whole day I'm there 
But most of the time I also travel uh to all the districts 
Then in the evening of course no one in the evening I come
back and I read
Or sometime may be I watch uh TV and sometime I read Holmes
And then in evening I watch one word after the
news I go to bed
Uh Miss Haralu do you mind if I ask a personal question
Uh I was wondering how come an attractive like 
lady like you is still single 
Uh thank you 
But you know I'm always uh very interested in career
And I wanted to do so many things and I still want to do so
many things
So I had no time to laugh
