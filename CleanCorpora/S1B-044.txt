Newly elected A I A D M K member of parliament  from
Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu 
he's 
""
Mr Shekhar welcome to our studio 
""
""
Thank you 
""
""
Tell us Mr Shekhar 
attribute the right of regional 
""
""
""
""
""
""
You see in India 
and uh 
""
""
Even though in this  because we
 having many differences and many communal individual parties
""
""
We refuse 
""
Then this is you see  many peoples are there peoples living or
having many languages 
""
This way the only regional parties  which are reflecting the
""
views 
""
And so the regional party is having just a close relationship which
is basically 
""
You know now-a-days you see that only the Congress have 
such  uh uh throughout
national vein 
""
No other party is rather having that much of 
""
Anyhow our A I A D M K Anna D M K 
puratchithalaivi 
""
Uh is having the party  in Andhra
 our capital
New Delhi itself 
""
So that not only the regional parties are developing in other
states our other regions 
""
Uh 
""
reflecting that uh 
""
So only the regional parties can built the  uh views and the
imagines or anything  the
peoples opinion 
""
Uh so  in our country just like
our country democratical country  freedoms
to regional parties  in one way
""
 the regional
parties are  uh uhm uh united itself and give a democratical set-up to our
nation
""
""
But do you think that regional parties have the same vision
 as the national party ?
""
""
Certainly  having the same
interest of uh 
""
You know that our M G R our beloved leader  in the time of war
war time of China 
man  who donated such a huge amount just like a thing it was more than a
 Pandit
""
""
He donated a huge amount
""
Nobody 
donated such amount 
""
 he
donated uh too much of high amount  to our Prime Minister for integration
""
""
But do you think that the regional party is  they you know
integrate the federal structure
""
""
Certainly because  regional party is having the same view
on  there
""
Reflecting there  their mother tongue
such like that 
""
 definitely
""
""
""
But do you think that the rise of regional parties is a
temporary phenomenon or it is a permanent feature of  our politics
""
""
""
 uh feature
""
Because nobody can uh 
regional 
""
So 
have many languages and many regions 
""
So this is the permanent one
""
Nobody can uh  close
this angle 
""
This is the only thing 
because whenever the regional parties have developed 
""
Then uh 
""
""
Mr Shekhar you were I believe totally associated with the late
M G R who was a very charismatic leader
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Tell us something more about him
""
""
M G R 
""
He has  for the poor people
and 
""
Uh in not only his cine his film not only come through cine 
cine or such 
""
Uh uh even though he was asked this he donated  uh uh a huge
amount by his hard work 
""
Whatever he earned  to the people
""
And after his death  uh his wealth
to his  people
""
Now-a-days it is said  our
properties to the poor peoples 
""
Just when you see and that  Puratchi
 uhm is true follower or the true leader after M G R
""
""
How is she carrying on the legacy of M G R 
""
""
Yes uh even those in the life life of M G R  M G R chose
""
be the future uh in your leader 
""
He uh  put to our Madam in our propoganda secretary at a
propoganda secretary 
""
After M G R  uh uh to
the party and had a beloved leader 
""
She placed 
from Tamil Nadu 
""
Uh 
""
""
But how is she ?
""
I mean  what M G R had done ?
""
""
In all political  uh
see even though in 
she was trained and she  come
through  only by M G R
""
And M G R choose  be the successor for the party
""
""
And now uh 
 you see all problems of uh by-elections and all other
things 
""
She is always with the poor people just like M G R
""
 fighting for the poor people for downtrodden people
 uh as in by election manifesto she has declared all things to the favour
and  uhm see in the
election manifesto  sort of manifesto
""
It is prepared only for the poor people
""
""
I can see that  pinned photograph of Ms
Jayalalitha  any particular reason for that ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yes she is our  she is the only leader after M G R
""
""
She is a true follower 
""
 proud of having her as our leader
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
Uhn  not only the poor
people but also the women  also
""
""
""
Uh  such a brilliant
such a uh  uh
 and welfare to the
poor  just like M G R
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Tell us Mr Shekharan something you attempt 
""
 been naturally involved in students politics also
""
""
Uh do you think there has been a criminalisation of students
politics in the country over the years ?
""
""
""
""
""
No no no 
""
Student activities not a criminal in politics not a criminal
activity  uh in student
activities in our dravidian movement  like our
Annavar Periyar  dravidian movement
""
That trains the students 
they must be after  of the
political that is our  uh political situation in Tamil Nadu
""
Or as well as in India international 
""
Uh to save their culture and their 
""
So 
that's  not a criminalisation
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
Uh what is the specific problem in your constituency in Dharmapuri
 ?
""
""
Dharmapuri you know is in now a days the Cauvery water dispute
is the major problem 
""
Our Madam also recommended our 
""
There is our recommended facts to send it to a tribunal 
""
Uh now 
""
""
Assuming that this problem is solved amicably  how will it
affect your constituency and Tamil Nadu as a whole ?
""
""
I I want to solve this for  welfare of all states

But the Tamil Nadu people those  uh are are utilised its water

constituency  that
Cauvery is well actually they gained a gateway  only through my
parliamentary constituency

But even in my parliamentary constituency  even though Cauvery
enters  we never got a drop of water for drinking facilities or irrigation
facilities 
""
Just as it enters and go to  some other areas

But  hydel project where they
must uh  have
discussed about putting a hydel project in  a very big
tourist centre

And in six districts we have got these projects centres  and
these are in border areas of Nagaland  state

And for these areas you know because it has rural and remote areas
 maternity and child welfare centres
we have put up 
""
And in these centres we have a  and a
""
""
""
What are the activities you are engaged  on these days
 ?
""
""
Uh we are mainly implementing the schemes  of the centre
 central social welfare board

And these are  social economic
programme 
""
There are  that programme we extend uh financial
assistance to the  for piggery which is very
popular

And uh  other programmes like holiday home camps for
children  fourteen years

And this is very also very popular

Usually these are conducted in winter  the children
are encouraged in this uh  in this those are mainly for four children or
four people you know

places and also conducting the camps for that to 
leadership training like that
