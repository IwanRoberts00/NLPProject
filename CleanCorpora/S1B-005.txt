The development of painting in India interruption 
on page number three hundred ninety-two 
As far as paintings are concerned here comes the role of frescos
Today the colours are much faded 
But it is of its own kind 
Another type of frescos we find at Barhat in Bihar 
And luckily Ajanta paintings are in Maharashtra 
The line used by the Ajanta artist is unique unparalleled 
Though I have mentioned the example of Barhat in Bihar but
 Ajanta frescos are are of its own type of its own class 
Depicting various stories in the life of Buddha 
In northern India the frescos at Bhag also 
The Mughals brought with them the traditions of Persian painting
Can we call it Indo-Islamic school of painting or art ?
Anyone of you ?
Can we call it Indo-Islamic school of painting in art ?
It can be called as it can be called Indo-Islamic
It can certainly be called because of fusion 
 Aini Akbari mentions a number
of artists Abdul Samad Mir Sayyed Ali Miskin Dasvant 
Dasvan Mukand 
So some of the famous names of the painters of the then times 
have been mentioned here 
Now page number three hundred ninety-four 
 Sir ninety-four 
Jahangir was a great patron of painting 
Patron means supporter helper 
One who helps us like a father is a patron 
One who helps us like mother is matron 
And original words they are from Sanskrit coming to Latin 
and then in modern Indian languages like English 
So original word is Pitro and Matro
 
Jahangir was a great patron of painting 
Was Akbar also a great patron of hist uh painting ?
Or only of painting ?
Wilson Smith has mentioned in his book on Akbar that Akbar was
a patron of all fine arts 
And I will include literature also in it 
So foundational work of the development in painting was
already done during the period of Akbar 
From second battle of Panipat fifteen fifty-six 
Closing year of Akbar's life sixteen hundred and five
So foundational work was done 
But his son who took the name Jahangir came to the
throne in sixteen hundred and five and died in sixteen twenty-seven 
So during this period of twenty-two years Indian fine art
 specially painting got tremendous stimulation and
boost 
So painting in India both of miniature type and mural
type have been developed during the period of Jahangir's
 special 
But only to be a patron not knowing anything about the art
Is it possible ?
Anyone of you ?
No sir no sir 
Why not ?
Now raise your hands 
Yes 
Without knowledge how can we draw our various things and
ideas can not possible
Correct 
So a man who knows the work can only get the work done 
from others 
 That's why rigorous training is imparted in
India to the cadet who become officers in future 
So he must had have a fair idea about
any type of work 
Then only he can get it done from others 
That is he can command perfectly 
Hotel de matol must be a good cook himself otherwise
holding that post in five- star Hotel at Bombay or any other international
centre is not a joke 
So not only we see but quite profeciency in any branch of work
 or discipline is a must 
Specially painting and various schools of art in painting
developed during the period of Jahangir mainly for a reason that he was
master of the art himself that he has mentioned 
Then Nadir Murad Bhishandas Manohar Govardhan 
Mansoor and Faruk Baig they all got help from emperor
himself 
Darashiko was a patron of painting 
Who was this Darashiko ?
Eldest son of Shajahan 
Youngest son of 
Eldest son of Shajahan was Darashiko 
What is the speciality about Darashiko ?
Can you mention one point in one sentence 
First stand and then give the answer 
 He was a the greatest 
Yes ?
Sit down
Yes ?
He practised what he preached 
 Haan 
You please explain that 
Means uh he never ignore for interested in art so
that he get man and what he told he would himself 
Yeah 
I would give the answer to this question myself like this 
He was a liberal minded man 
He was a follower of Sufism 
He was tolerant to all religions and therefore he was a patron
of all schools of arts 
All types of religions wherever he found some sort of spark 
he was always ready to run there as a patron to help it 
So all types of artist got encouragement from him
It was not that only the Muslims got it Hindus were in
majority 
Perhaps this might not have been liked by Aurangzeb and may
be because of that Darashiko was disposed off 
Even put to death 
And the rule which Aurangzeb afterwards introduced was full of
fanaticism too full of debauchery 
That may be the reason Darashiko is a great personality 
He got many and various books of Sanskrit translated into
Persian 
Such type of liberal man 
Can he encourage arts in India ?
Raise your hands and answer because my next question
will be please explain 
Yes ?
He was learned scholar and free views on others means 
Yes but 
Such type of man who is a you can say a saintly type of man 
Can he encourage the arts ?
Perhaps 
No not so 
Sit down
Yes ?
As he was in interested in painting therefore he
 used to encourage 
 Accha was he encourage uh uh was he
interested only in painting
No he was interested in literature
He translated many book of that Indo-Persian books and he
used to read them 
Yeah 
So literature painting 
Was he intersted in architecture ?
No 
Anyone raise the hands 
No 
Jahangir was specially interested in painting exclusively
And therefore this book which is the publication of N C E R T
has specially mentioned the name of Jahangir here though 
Darashiko in with his limitation has previously tried to
encourage various arts 
The most important schools of painting emerged where the 
Rajasthani and Pahari Schools 
 Pahari 
What is this Pahari School ?
If anybody knows 
Sir it is One word Pahari School
Anyone else ?
You ?
It is from pahad 
 Haan pahari work comes from 
pahad 
 It's pahadi so pahadi da
 is many times pronounced as ra 
So in mountainous region in the Himalayas various
schools of art developed 
In painting also 
So all of them put together are known as pahari
 paintings 
What is this Rajasthani painting ?
Sir desert desert 
Yes ?
Developing in Rajasthan
Developing in Rajasthan 
It has got nothing to do with desert because mainly the
paintings in Rajasthan are about life of Shri Krishna 
And the period of the early life and afterwards desert period
 was around Mathura and then in Gujarat because the new city
which he established can you tell the name of that city which was
established by Shri Krishna ?
Dwarka
Dwarka which has now seen the bottom of the 
ocean 
 Ocean 
Please sit down 
It has been unearthed by one word noise
 Haan under the supervision of him it
has been located now 
So it is a very good proof about all descriptions which
you find about that city in Mahabharat 
Sit down 
Then languages and literature 
Two main groups of languages the Indo-European or Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian 
Why he has said Indo-European and Indo-Aryan ?
Because Aryans came from Aryavarta 
No I would like to suggest you one method 
Yes Soman ?
Because Aryans came from the north uh northern
track of Asia and they have got their own language 
Yes ?
The Aryans came from the region of Caspian Sea 
Yes 
Around the Caspian Sea from Central Asia 
Some of the tribes went to Europe some of them 
reached in India 
But they are included in the Indo-European group 
So Indo-Europeans or Indo-Aryans 
Why this uh word Indo comes there ?
Sir they came to India 
 India 
River Indus 
Means that tribes of the Aryans who came to India 
can they be called Indo-Europeans ?
If they centralised form of culture of India
If they can be called as Indo-Europeans then what is the
 need for the use of word Indo uh uh Indo-Aryans ?
You think and answer 
Not just your guess 
Because they are the Aryans now settled in India
Then only you call them Indo-Aryans 
Then nothing about Indo-Europeans at all 
Because they come neither from Europe nor from India 
They come from Central Asia 
So Indo-European what do you understand by the word
Indo-Europeans ?
Europeans coming in India
Europeans settled in India 
Europeans settled in India
Never 
There is no record because Indo- European is a false language
 Indo-Aryans is correct 
And Aryans who settled in Europe 
What word he has used for that ?
Indo-Aryans 
Aryans who settled in Europe ?
 Indo- Europeans 
 Europe 
It looks simple but it is not simple 
So now finally last question 
To what branch do we belong today ?
Indo-Aryans 
Dravidians 
Dravidians 
Anyone else ?
Indo-Aryans
Indo-Aryans 
If we are Indo-Aryans and one boy said Dravidian then what
is the difference between Indo- Aryans and Dravidians ?
Now burden will fall on your shoulders 
Dravidians were in India 
Yes ?
They were 
They were original inhabitants of India 
They were original inhabitants of India before coming of
whom ?
Aryans 
Before coming of Indo-Europeans or Aryans
 Aryans 
Or Indo-Aryans 
Where do they live even today ?
Southern part of India
What is this method ?
Means what part of India ?
Southern part of India
Southern part of India only 
Then those who have settled in forest because of the onslaught
of the Aryans original inhabitants of India as you have just now said 
who were defeated by the Aryans 
History records that they ran away into the deep jungles and
forests 
What are you going to call them 
You say you uh Dravidians are settled only in South India
 That's why this question I am putting up ?
Before coming of the Aryans all the people they who were living in
India according to your definition are original inhabitants of India 
Did all of them run to South ?
Nobody ran to the East North or West ?
Ran
Ran 
Then what are they ?
What are you going to call them ?
Are they there today or not ?
Yes sir 
Then what is their names ?
Tribes
Schedule tribe
Tribes 
Whom we have scheduled in the constitution
So we call them scheduled tribes 
Now my final question 
Those Dravidians who you say that are in South India can you
call them scheduled tribes ?
No
No sir 
Why not ?
Just now you gave the definition I am only clearing your ideas
Yes ?
These are minorities that is they referred they have
been a few words 
Then ?
From there Orissa 
Imparts yes ?
There have been means uh Indo-Aryans sir Indo-Aryans then
 some of these split into 
Dravidians 
Then what is the use of calling them Dravidians 
They are not called as Dravidians 
You see the reason is like this Aryans came 
conquered India defeated the original inhabitants
But all this drama was played in North India 
Or such a long period Aryans just could not come to the south 
for two reasons 
First thing north India is not a small place 
It is very big area 
Thus they would be going by slope only 
If they come across the mountains naturally they are going to
avoid that side or direction 
So their journey was Eastwards till the conquest of 
modern Bengal Assam Arunachal Pradesh
That is upto uh uh Jaintia Patkoi hills 
and Patkoi hills
 Patkoi hills 
Sir hills
Garo Khasi
Patkoi Patkoi
Then they would turn to the South 
So it took a very long time for them to defeat the people who
were already settled in South and who had developing 
developed their special culture and they had developed their
languages with the different scripts
This is important 
Cultural heritage is mainly this 
So Kannada Andhra and was Telugu Malyalam and
Tamil is basic languages of the original inhabitants of the country
 or of Dravidian nature 
But they were not misplaced 
They were not disorganised they continued to prosper and
develop their own way of life which is known as culture 
So Dravidian culture is mainly in south India in that sense 
Sanskrit was a language of the Indo- Aryans 
Does it mean Sanskrit was not the language of the Dravidian group
 ?
Yes sir
But it might 
Pointed question you think and answer 
Last boy ?
No 
No 
No 
 One or two words 
Dravidians people may have learnt that language from the Aryans
From the Aryans only ?
Because Yes sir 
 Unless 
Ah unless the Aryans penetrate into the south they can
not understand nor they can come in the contact of uh Indo-Aryans
 language that is Sanskrit 
Can there be a language without grammar ?
No 
No then what is first grammar or language ?
Grammar
Language 
Follow one method 
What will take first ?
What will come into being first Grammar or the language ?
The language and 
First language 
First language only will come 
The child who imitates the parents and tries to speak doesn't know
anything about grammar 
But once that pattern is set then someone had to bring it into
rules 
Then once the rules are framed all the things or writings 
or your way of speak is not according to those rules
Then we say this is not correct grammar 
But is it a language ?
Yes it is
It is a language 
So Sanskrit language Aryans brought with them only from
Central Asia 
But the period is early the people were in the form of tribes
War type of warriors better conquerers 
But once they settled on the permanent footing in the 
Sapta Sindhu areas that is Punjab then someone must give
some rules also 
To consolidate it to classify it to make it classical one
 Panini did that work
