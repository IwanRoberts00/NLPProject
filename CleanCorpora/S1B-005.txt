The development of painting in India 
on page number three hundred ninety-two 
""
As far as paintings are concerned  here comes the role of frescos
""
""
Today 
""
But it is of its own kind 
""
Another type of frescos we find at Barhat 
""
And 
""
The line used by the Ajanta artist is unique 
""
Though I have mentioned the example of Barhat  but
""
""
Depicting various stories 
""
In northern India 
""
The Mughals brought with them the traditions of Persian painting
""
""
Can we call it  ?
""
Anyone  ?
""
Can we call it  ?
""
""
It can be called as  it can be called Indo-Islamic
""
""
It can certainly be called 
""
 mentions a number
of artists 
Dasvan 
""
So some of the famous names of the painters of the then times 
have been mentioned here 
""
Now page number three hundred 
""
""
""
""
""
Jahangir was a great 
""
Patron means 
""
One who helps us like a father 
""
One who helps us like mother 
""
And original words they are 
and then in modern Indian languages like English 
""
So original word is  Matro
""
""
Jahangir was a great 
""
Was Akbar also a great patron of  ?
""
Or only of painting  ?
""
Wilson Smith has mentioned in his book on Akbar  that Akbar was
a patron of all fine arts 
""
And I will include literature also in it 
""
So foundational work of the development in painting  was
already done during the period of Akbar 
""
From 
""
Closing year of  sixteen hundred and five
""
""
So foundational work was done 
""
But his son  came to the
throne in sixteen hundred and five 
""
So during this period  Indian fine art
 and
boost 
""
So painting in India  of miniature type and mural
type  Jahangir's
""
""
But only to be a patron  not knowing anything about the art
""
""
Is it possible ?
""
Anyone of you ?
""
""
No sir no sir 
""
""
Why not  ?
""
Now raise your hands 
""
Yes 
""
""
Without knowledge how can we draw our  various things and
ideas can not possible
""
""
Correct 
""
So a man who knows the work 
from others 
""
 in
India 
""
So he must  a fair idea about
any type of work 
""
Then only he can get it done from others 
""
That is he can command perfectly 
""
Hotel de matol must be a good cook  otherwise
holding that post in five- star Hotel at Bombay or any other international
centre 
""
So not only we see but quite profeciency in any  branch of work
""
""
Specially painting  and various schools of art in painting
developed during the period of Jahangir  mainly for a reason that he was
master of the art himself 
""
Then Nadir Murad 
Mansoor  emperor
himself 
""
Darashiko 
""
Who was this Darashiko ?
""
""
Eldest son of Shajahan 
""
""
Youngest son of 
""
""
Eldest son of Shajahan 
""
What is the speciality about Darashiko ?
""
Can you mention one point 
""
First stand 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  ?
""
Sit down
""
Yes ?
""
""
He practised what he preached 
""
""
""
""
You please explain that 
""
""
Means uh  so
that he get man 
""
""
Yeah 
""
I would give the answer to this question myself like this 
""
He was a liberal minded man 
""
He was a follower of Sufism 
""
He was tolerant to all religions  and therefore he was a patron
of all 
""
All types of religions 
he was always ready to run there as a patron 
""
So  artist got encouragement from him
""
It was not that only the Muslims got it  Hindus were in
majority 
""
Perhaps this might not have been liked by Aurangzeb  may
be because of that 
""
Even put to death 
""
And the rule which Aurangzeb afterwards introduced  was full of
fanaticism 
""
That may be the 
""
He got many and various books  translated into
Persian 
""
Such type of liberal man 
""
Can he  ?
""
Raise your hands  my next question
will be please explain 
""
Yes  ?
""
""
He was learned scholar and free views on others 
""
""
Yes but 
""
Such type of man who is a you can say 
""
Can he encourage the arts  ?
""
""
Perhaps 
""
""
No 
""
Sit down
""
Yes ?
""
""
As he was  he
""
""
""
 uh uh was he
interested only in painting
""
""
No he was interested in literature
""
He translated many book  and he
used to read them 
""
""
Yeah 
""
So literature 
""
Was he intersted in architecture  ?
""
""
No 
""
""
Anyone raise the hands 
""
No 
""
Jahangir was specially interested  exclusively
""
""
And therefore  this book which is the publication of N C E R T
has specially mentioned the name of 
Darashiko  to
encourage various arts 
""
The most important schools of painting emerged where the 
Rajasthani 
""
""
""
""
""
What is this  ?
""
If anybody knows 
""
""
Sir it is  School
""
""
""
Anyone else  ?
""
You ?
""
""
It is from 
""
""
""
pahad 
""
 da
""
""
So in mountainous region  various
schools of art developed 
""
In painting also 
""
So all of them put together  pahari
""
""
What is this Rajasthani painting ?
""
""
Sir desert 
""
""
Yes ?
""
""
Developing in Rajasthan
""
""
Developing in Rajasthan 
""
It has got nothing to do with desert  because mainly the
paintings in Rajasthan are 
""
And the period of the early life and afterwards  desert period
 because the new city
which he established  which was
established by  Krishna ?
""
""
Dwarka
""
""
Dwarka 
ocean 
""
""
""
""
""
Please sit down 
""
""
It has been unearthed by  noise
""
""
""
 it
has been located now 
""
So it is a very good proof  which
you find about that city in 
""
Sit down 
""
Then languages and literature 
""
Two main groups of languages  the Indo-European or Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian 
""
Why he has said Indo-European and Indo-Aryan ?
""
""
Because Aryans came from 
""
""
No I would like to suggest you one method 
""
Yes Soman  ?
""
""
Because Aryans  northern
track of Asia 
""
""
Yes  ?
""
""
The Aryans came from the region of Caspian Sea 
""
""
Yes 
""
Around the Caspian Sea 
""
Some of the tribes 
reached in India 
""
But they are included in the 
""
So Indo-Europeans or Indo-Aryans 
""
Why this uh  ?
""
""
Sir they came to 
""
""
""
""
""
River Indus 
""
""
Means that 
can they be called Indo-Europeans  ?
""
""
If they centralised form of culture of India
""
""
If they can be called as Indo-Europeans  then what is the
 ?
""
You think and answer 
""
Not just your guess 
""
""
Because they are the Aryans now settled in India
""
""
Then only you call them Indo-Aryans 
""
Then nothing about Indo-Europeans at all 
""
Because they come neither from Europe nor from India 
""
They come from Central Asia 
""
So Indo-European  what do you understand by the word
Indo-Europeans  ?
""
""
Europeans coming in India
""
""
Europeans settled in India 
""
""
Europeans settled in India
""
""
Never 
""
There is no record  because Indo- European is a false language
""
""
And 
""
What word he has used for that  ?
""
""
Indo-Aryans 
""
""
Aryans who settled in Europe  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It looks simple but it is not simple 
""
So now finally last question 
""
To what branch do we belong today  ?
""
""
Indo-Aryans 
""
""
Dravidians 
""
""
Dravidians 
""
""
Anyone else  ?
""
""
Indo-Aryans
""
""
Indo-Aryans 
""
If we are Indo-Aryans  then what
is the difference between Indo- Aryans and Dravidians  ?
""
Now 
""
""
Dravidians were in India 
""
""
Yes ?
""
""
They were 
""
""
They were original inhabitants of India 
""
""
They were original inhabitants of India  before coming of
whom ?
""
""
Aryans 
""
""
Before coming of  or Aryans
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or Indo-Aryans 
""
Where do they live even today  ?
""
""
Southern part of India
""
""
What is this method  ?
""
Means what part of India  ?
""
""
Southern part of India
""
""
Southern part of India only 
""
Then those who have settled in forest  because of the onslaught
of the Aryans 
who were defeated by the Aryans 
""
History records that they ran away into the deep jungles and
forests 
""
What are you going to call them 
""
You say  you uh Dravidians are settled only in South India
""
 ?
""
Before coming of the Aryans all the people they who were living in
India 
""
Did all of them run to South  ?
""
Nobody ran to the East  ?
""
""
Ran
""
""
Ran 
""
Then what are they ?
""
What are you going to call them  ?
""
Are they there today or not ?
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Then what is their names  ?
""
""
Tribes
""
""
Schedule tribe
""
""
Tribes 
""
Whom we have scheduled in the constitution
""
So we call them scheduled tribes 
""
Now my final question 
""
Those Dravidians who you say that are in South India  can you
call them scheduled tribes  ?
""
""
No
""
No sir 
""
""
Why not  ?
""
Just now you gave the definition  I am only clearing your ideas
""
""
Yes ?
""
""
These are minorities  they have
been 
""
""
Then ?
""
""
From there Orissa 
""
""
Imparts yes ?
""
""
There have been means uh Indo-Aryans  sir Indo-Aryans then
""
""
""
Dravidians 
""
Then what is the use of calling them Dravidians 
""
""
They are not called as Dravidians 
""
""
You see 
conquered India  defeated the original inhabitants
""
But all this drama was played in North India 
""
Or such a long period Aryans just could not come to the south 
for two reasons 
""
First thing 
""
It is very big area 
""
Thus they would be going by slope only 
""
If they come across the mountains naturally they are going to
avoid that 
""
So their journey was Eastwards 
modern  Arunachal Pradesh
""
That is 
and Patkoi hills
""
""
""
""
""
Sir hills
""
""
Garo Khasi
""
""
Patkoi Patkoi
""
""
Then 
""
So it took a very long time for them  to defeat the people who
were already settled in South and who had 
developed  and they had developed their
languages with the different scripts
""
This is important 
""
Cultural heritage is mainly this 
""
So  and
Tamil is basic  of the original inhabitants of the country
""
""
But they were not misplaced 
""
They were not disorganised  to prosper and
develop their own way of life 
""
So Dravidian culture is mainly in south India in that sense 
""
Sanskrit was a language of the Indo- Aryans 
""
Does it mean Sanskrit was not the language of the Dravidian group
 ?
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
But it might 
""
""
Pointed question 
""
Last boy  ?
""
No 
""
""
No 
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
Dravidians people may have learnt that language from the Aryans
""
""
""
From the Aryans only  ?
""
""
Because 
""
""
""
""
Ah  they can
not understand  Indo-Aryans
""
""
Can there be a language without grammar  ?
""
""
No 
""
""
No  ?
""
""
Grammar
""
""
Language 
""
""
Follow one method 
""
What will take first  ?
""
What will come into being first Grammar or the language  ?
""
""
The language and 
""
""
First language 
""
""
First language only will come 
""
The child who imitates the parents and tries to speak doesn't know
anything about grammar 
""
But once that pattern is set  then someone had to bring it into
rules 
""
Then once the rules are framed 
or your way of speak  is not according to those rules
""
Then we say this is not correct grammar 
""
But is it a language ?
""
""
Yes it is
""
""
It is a language 
""
So Sanskrit language  with them only from
Central Asia 
""
But the period is early  the people were in the form of tribes
""
""
War type of warriors 
""
But once they settled 
Sapta  must give
some rules also 
""
To consolidate it  to make it classical one
""
