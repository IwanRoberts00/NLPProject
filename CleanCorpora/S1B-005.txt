The development of painting in India 
""
""
As far as paintings are concerned  here comes the role of frescos
""
""
""
""
But it is of its own kind 
""
Another type of frescos we find at Barhat 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The Mughals brought with them the traditions of Persian painting
""
""
Can we call it  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Dasvan 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Jahangir was a great 
""
Patron means 
""
""
""
One who helps us like mother 
""
And original words they are 
and then in modern Indian languages like English 
""
So original word is  Matro
""
""
Jahangir was a great 
""
""
""
Or only of painting  ?
""
Wilson Smith has mentioned in his book on Akbar  that Akbar was
""
""
And I will include literature also in it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But his son  came to the
throne in sixteen hundred and five 
""
So during this period  Indian fine art
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why not  ?
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in
""
""
""
""
""
Then only he can get it done from others 
""
""
""
""
""
centre 
""
So not only we see but quite profeciency in any  branch of work
""
""
""
developed during the period of Jahangir  mainly for a reason that he was
master of the art himself 
""
Then Nadir Murad 
""
himself 
""
Darashiko 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Eldest son of Shajahan 
""
""
""
""
""
First stand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that he get man 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He was a follower of Sufism 
""
""
of all 
""
""
""
""
""
""
It was not that only the Muslims got it  Hindus were in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fanaticism 
""
""
""
""
Persian 
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
Such type of man who is a you can say 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
""

Anyone raise the hands 
""

Rajasthani 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If anybody knows 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In painting also 
""
""
""
""
What is this Rajasthani painting ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Developing in Rajasthan
""
""
""
""
It has got nothing to do with desert  because mainly the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Dwarka
""
""
""
ocean 
""
""
""
""
""
Please sit down 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
has been located now 
""
So it is a very good proof  which
""
""
""
""
""
""
Two main groups of languages  the Indo-European or Indo-Aryan
""
""
Why he has said Indo-European and Indo-Aryan ?
""
""
Because Aryans came from 
""
""
""
""
Yes Soman  ?
""
""
Because Aryans  northern
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
Around the Caspian Sea 
""
Some of the tribes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why this uh  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Means that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not just your guess 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because they come neither from Europe nor from India 
""
They come from Central Asia 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Europeans settled in India 
""
""
Europeans settled in India
""
""
Never 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Aryans who settled in Europe  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Anyone else  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Indo-Aryans 
""
""
is the difference between Indo- Aryans and Dravidians  ?
""
Now 
""
""
Dravidians were in India 
""
""
Yes ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Southern part of India
""
""
What is this method  ?
""
""
""
""
Southern part of India
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
History records that they ran away into the deep jungles and
""
""
What are you going to call them 
""
You say  you uh Dravidians are settled only in South India
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Nobody ran to the East  ?
""
""
Ran
""
""
""
""
Then what are they ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Then what is their names  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Tribes 
""
""
""
""
""
Now my final question 
""
""
call them scheduled tribes  ?
""
""
No
""
""
""
""
""
""
Just now you gave the definition  I am only clearing your ideas
""
""
Yes ?
""
""
These are minorities  they have
""
""
""
""
""
""
From there Orissa 
""
""
""
""
""
There have been means uh Indo-Aryans  sir Indo-Aryans then
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You see 
""
""
But all this drama was played in North India 
""
Or such a long period Aryans just could not come to the south 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If they come across the mountains naturally they are going to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir hills
""
""
Garo Khasi
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
were already settled in South and who had 
developed  and they had developed their
""
""
This is important 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
develop their own way of life 
""
""
""
""
""
Does it mean Sanskrit was not the language of the Dravidian group
""
