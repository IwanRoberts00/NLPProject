This is All India Radio Bombay 
It is nine thirty 
We shall now hear a talk entitled Random Thoughts
 by Dr Usha Thakkar 
Questions before us are baffling and issues around us are
overwhelming 
When I start thinking about them I get taken over by their
variety and volume 
And these different strands are woven together and the emerging
picture becomes clear and grim 
And I start wondering what is happening to us as individual
 as society as a nation 
Crisis seems to have penetrated everywhere 
Is it political economic cultural or the crisis of life
itself ?
We see many young children begging on streets and working
in dangerous conditions 
We hear many incidents about young women being burnt for
dowry 
Innocent persons getting imprisoned in the trap of bonded
labour 
And the youth going astray due to lack of direction 
We read about many massacres in cities and villages 
We know many persons who exchange their ethics and ideals for
money 
We are aware of many cases of bribery and forgery 
Our attention is often drawn to scandal in educational
institutions the citadels of learning 
And nothing happens to us 
Have we lost our sensitivity the very core of human life ?
We preach morality to children and we talk of values to all 
but we do not hesitate in compromising when it comes to personal gain 
We see nothing wrong in seeking personal favours for
gratification 
Is this in accordance with what we say ?
And what impact is it going to have on the young generation who
get bewildered and confused by this discrepancy between action and
preaching 
Corruption seems to have penetrated in all spheres of life 
and worse then that it seems that we have accepted that it has come
to stay 
Work culture gets adversely affected by this 
Demands for rights are put forward without due consideration to
duties 
Previleges are sought without fulfilling obligations 
Consumerism and hedonism dominate our time 
Pursuit of comfort mixes get oblivious of the means adopted for
the same 
The importance of money is accepted unchallenged 
Everything starts getting measured in terms of money and then
 values are turned in prices 
People get to use Henry Millers' expression 
 Protected by money learnt by money dulled by money 
New inventions advance in technology and wonders of
computers have certainly opened new vistas for human beings 
But we'll not go in ahead without values and ideals 
pushes into an age of despair and destruction 
Emerson had said that The true test of civilization is 
not the census not the size of cities nor the crops 
No but the kind of man the country turns out 
Unfortunately today we see men surrendering their ideals to
expediency and yielding their sensitivity to the pressure of power 
Respect for human value and constraints on human greed 
and lust were never more important than they are today 
Gandhi had pointed out that hankering after riches forces
one to exploitation in some form or other 
The modern civilization with its emphasis on materialism 
and its basis of exploitation of the weak is equivalent to darkness and
disease 
True civilization consists not in accumulation of commodity 
but in a deliberate and voluntary reduction of one 
Politics bereft of religion is a death trap because it
kills the soul 
Unfortunately today we are at such junction in history where
the line between good and evil often gets blurred and consequently
the distinction between heroes and villains also often gets blurred 
The practice of putting profits before prudence and the
instinct of putting I before we 
have eroded the foundation of human values 
If humanity itself is lost would a human being be a human 
or a mere robot ?
In that case what about future ?
One undoubtedly is in agreement which the Russian poet Andrei
Muroyiv when he said that I am not interested in the twenty-first
century if it will be only robots 
It can happen but it will be death 
We will be alive but dead 
We start enumerating the advantages and gains profits and
pay-offs and neglect human values and human emotions 
We ignore the highways and start getting lost in lanes and
by-lanes where paths become narrower and narrower 
As a nation we are going through rough times 
Nationalism often becomes synonym with factitious 
politics and this gives boost to destabilizing and destructive forces
Ugly forces of communalism fundamentalism regionalism 
and terrorism rock the tranquility of the country 
Instances of communal riots and political violence provide
material for headlines to media 
Events and happening in the field of politics indicate
clearly that politics is the game of power 
The game of ruthless strategies the game of selfish interest
 where moral norms and high ideals are pushed aside and where
credibility and accountability become meaningless words 
Problem of poverty has assumed grave dimension due to illiteracy
Basic needs of food shelter and clothing of the people have
yet to be fulfilled 
Rising prices inflation and unemployment bring
unprecedented pressures on the common man 
Today problems are many and solutions are not simple 
We have to accept the fact that ours is a plural society 
where diversity in religion caste community and language is
overwhelming 
This plurality cannot be hidden under the clock of concensus
 nor can they be blinded branded as
confrontation 
Aspirations and grievances of various ethnic religious 
linguistic and minority groups demand special attention to cultural
ethos and recognition to diversity 
As the noise over Masjid-Mandir 
employment and social justice ethnic diversity and minority rights is
getting louder law and order situation is worsening 
The weak and the underprevileged sections of the society still
suffer from discrimination 
Here I would like to focus on the status of women 
Even now after so many years of Independence women suffer
problems of inequality and discrimination dependant and domination
Some individual women have achieved stupendous success in some
fields such as education and politics 
The Constitution has granted equality and some progressive laws
are enacted 
But the majority of women are lost in the darkness of ignorance 
The literacy rate among women is only thirty-nine point
forty-two percent 
The fact to remind that India is a nation where people
belonging to different religions live and practice their own way of
life 
The Constitution did not establish a common civil code and the
personal laws of different communities remain operative 
It is unfortunate that in a democratic and secular state like
ours all the women are not on equal footing 
Women of different religions and communities suffer under
oppressive personal laws 
Traditional norms of behaviour and inequality have taken deep roots
in our social system 
Revival of religious fundamentalism intensifies the threat to
 women's equality 
It is sad to note that social evils like dedication of
girls to temple polygamy and seclusion of women
 have thrived in the name of religion 
There are some laws which provide protection to women but
the cunning and conniving do not take long to find the loop holes 
Moreover the process is long painful and expensive 
The question remains how many women would muster courage and
resources to fight discrimination ?
Bigamy is still not extinct 
The provision regarding the age of marriage gets frequently
violated 
 Women's access to rights of property 
maintenance inheritance divorce alimony and custody of children
 get limited 
Many laws lose their meaning in the absence of proper
implementation 
Though it is one of the duties of an Indian citizen to
renounce all practices derogatory to the dignity of women women are
often subjected to atrocity like grave or physical assault 
Trade in human flesh is still prevalent 
Rape victims suffer from tremendous trauma and damage to their
personality 
Crimes against women continue to rise 
There were more than six thousand reported victims of rape in
nineteen eighty-seven and more than fifteen hundred dowry deaths 
including burning 
The declining sex ratio is an issue causing grave concern 
The nineteen ninetey-one census shows only nine hundred and
twenty-nine women against thousand man 
This is an issue not just of number but a pointer at our social
reality 
Neglect at every stage is the fate of the women 
Survival itself becomes difficult as is evident from the misuse
of the sex determination test 
Age specific death rate indicate higher rates for female
children and women upto thirty-five years of age 
The discrimination against the women in economic arena still exist
The provisions of labour laws and equal pay for equal work do
not reach all women and provisions are not properly implemented 
Almost ninety percent of women workers are engaged in
unorganized sector 
Studies clearly show that modernisation and mechanisation tend
to marginalise women in many sectors 
The fact remains that there cannot be division of women into
groups of working women and non-working women 
Women work but their work goes unnoticed 
Invisible hands of women are always at work but the data
system with respect to women's work is imperfect 
Estimates of the average hours of unpaid work done by women
 outside their homes vary from six to seven hours per day with some
women working upto ten hours or more 
Apart from the domestic duty women are engaged in agricultural
operation for an average of twelve hours a day 
They have to keep themselves and their families alive 
In rural areas thirty to thirty-five percent of household 
are headed by women still there access to ownership of land and
property is negligible 
Women find it extremely difficult to enter the male dominated
field of politics 
The crucial fact is that women find themselves being judged
 and often judging themselves by two different standards 
One standard is of traditional role of the private world which
regards her as homebound nurturing submissive and emotional 
The other standard is of her changed role in the public world
 which expects her to be ambitious rational progressive and
competetive 
This private public divide bring severe pressures on her 
Other deterrants in her way are approach of political parties
 prohibitive election expenses demands of home and family and
fear of character assassination 
Still we have a long way to go 
Democratic notions of equality and liberty have to percolate
in her day-to-day life 
Journey of democracy is never static or uneventful 
Today realities are hard and challenges are tough but we the
people of India have to give a positive response
