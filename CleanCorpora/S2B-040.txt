This is All India Radio Bombay 
""
It is nine thirty 
""
We shall now hear a talk  Random Thoughts
""
""
Questions before us are baffling  and issues around us are
overwhelming 
""
When I start thinking about them  I get taken over by their
variety and volume 
""
And these different strands are woven together  and the emerging
picture becomes clear and grim 
""
And I start wondering  as individual
""
""
Crisis seems to have penetrated everywhere 
""
Is it political  cultural or the crisis of life
itself  ?
""
We see many young children  and working
in dangerous conditions 
""
We hear many incidents  being burnt for
dowry 
""
Innocent persons  getting imprisoned in the trap of bonded
labour 
""
And the youth going astray 
""
We read about many massacres 
""
We know many persons  who exchange their ethics and ideals for
money 
""
We are aware of many cases of bribery and forgery 
""
Our attention is often drawn  to scandal in educational
institutions 
""
And nothing happens to us 
""
Have we lost our sensitivity  ?
""
We preach morality to children 
but we do not hesitate in compromising 
""
We see nothing wrong in seeking personal  for
gratification 
""
Is this in accordance  ?
""
And what impact is it going to have on the young generation  who
get bewildered and confused  by this discrepancy between action and
preaching 
""
Corruption seems to have penetrated 
and worse then that  that it has come
to stay 
""
Work culture gets adversely affected by this 
""
Demands for rights are put forward  without due consideration to
duties 
""
Previleges are sought without fulfilling obligations 
""
Consumerism and hedonism dominate our time 
""
Pursuit of comfort  mixes get oblivious of the means adopted for
the same 
""
The importance of money 
""
Everything starts getting measured in terms of money  and then
""
""
People get 
""
""
""
New inventions  and wonders of
computers have certainly opened new vistas for human beings 
""
But 
pushes into an age of despair and destruction 
""
Emerson had said that 
not the census 
""
No 
""
Unfortunately today we see  men surrendering their ideals to
expediency 
""
Respect for human value 
and lust were never more important 
""
Gandhi had pointed out  forces
one 
""
The modern civilization 
and its basis of exploitation of the weak  is equivalent to darkness and
disease 
""
True civilization consists 
but 
""
Politics  it
kills the soul 
""
Unfortunately today we are at such junction in history  where
the line between good and evil  and consequently
the distinction between heroes and villains also often gets blurred 
""
The practice of putting  and the
instinct of putting 
have eroded the foundation of human values 
""
If humanity itself is lost 
or a mere robot  ?
""
In that case  ?
""
One undoubtedly is in agreement  which the Russian poet Andrei
Muroyiv when he said  I am not interested in the twenty-first
century 
""
It can happen but it will be death 
""
We will be alive 
""
We start enumerating  profits and
pay-offs 
""
We ignore the highways  in lanes and
by-lanes where paths become narrower and narrower 
""
As a nation 
""
Nationalism often becomes synonym 
politics  to destabilizing and destructive forces
""
""
Ugly forces of communalism 
and terrorism rock the tranquility of the country 
""
Instances  of communal riots and political violence provide
material 
""
Events and happening  indicate
clearly that politics 
""
The game of ruthless strategies  the game of selfish interest
 and where
credibility and accountability 
""
Problem of poverty has assumed grave dimension due to illiteracy
""
""
Basic needs of food  and clothing of the people have
yet to be fulfilled 
""
Rising prices  bring
unprecedented pressures on the common man 
""
Today problems are many and solutions are not simple 
""
We have to accept the fact 
where diversity in religion  and language is
overwhelming 
""
This plurality  cannot be hidden under the clock of concensus
 as
confrontation 
""
Aspirations and grievances of various ethnic 
linguistic  to cultural
ethos and recognition to diversity 
""
As the noise over 
employment and social justice  is
getting louder 
""
The weak and the underprevileged sections of the society still
suffer from discrimination 
""
Here I would like to focus on the status of women 
""
Even now  women suffer
problems  dependant and domination
""
""
Some individual women have achieved  stupendous success in some
fields such as education and politics 
""
The Constitution has granted equality  and some progressive laws
are enacted 
""
But the majority of women are lost in the darkness of ignorance 
""
The literacy rate among women  is only thirty-nine point
forty-two percent 
""
The fact to remind  where people
belonging to different  their own way of
life 
""
The Constitution did not establish a common civil code  and the
personal laws of different communities 
""
It is unfortunate  that in a democratic and secular state like
ours 
""
Women of different  religions and communities suffer under
oppressive personal laws 
""
Traditional norms of behaviour and inequality have taken deep roots
in our social system 
""
Revival of religious fundamentalism  intensifies the threat to
""
""
It is sad to note that social evils like  dedication of
girls to temple  seclusion of women
""
""
There are some laws  but
the cunning and conniving 
""
Moreover 
""
The question remains  how many women would muster courage and
resources  ?
""
Bigamy is still not extinct 
""
The provision regarding the age of marriage gets frequently
violated 
""
""
maintenance  alimony and custody of children
""
""
Many laws  lose their meaning in the absence of proper
implementation 
""
Though it is one of the duties  to
renounce all practices  women are
often subjected to atrocity 
""
Trade in human flesh is still prevalent 
""
Rape victims suffer from tremendous trauma  and damage to their
personality 
""
Crimes against women 
""
There were more than six thousand reported  victims of rape in
nineteen eighty-seven 
including burning 
""
The declining sex ratio 
""
The nineteen ninetey-one census  shows only nine hundred and
twenty-nine women against 
""
This is an issue  not just of number but a pointer at our social
reality 
""
Neglect at every stage 
""
Survival itself becomes difficult  as is evident from the misuse
of the sex determination test 
""
Age specific death rate indicate  higher rates for female
children 
""
The discrimination against the women in economic arena still exist
""
""
The provisions of labour laws and equal pay for equal work  do
not reach all women and 
""
Almost  are engaged in
unorganized sector 
""
Studies clearly show  that modernisation and mechanisation tend
to marginalise women in many sectors 
""
The fact remains  that there cannot be division of women into
groups of working women and non-working women 
""
Women work 
""
Invisible hands of women are always at work  but the data
system with respect to 
""
Estimates of the average hours of unpaid work  done by women
 with some
women working upto ten hours or more 
""
Apart from the domestic duty  women are engaged in agricultural
operation 
""
They have to keep themselves and their families alive 
""
In rural areas 
are headed by women  and
property is negligible 
""
Women find it extremely difficult  to enter the male dominated
field of politics 
""
The crucial fact is  that women find themselves being judged
""
""
One standard is of traditional role of the private world  which
regards her as homebound 
""
The other standard is  of her changed role in the public world
 progressive and
competetive 
""
This private public divide bring severe pressures on her 
""
Other deterrants in her way are  approach of political parties
 and
fear of character assassination 
""
Still we have a long way to go 
""
Democratic notions of equality and liberty  have to percolate
in her day-to-day life 
""
Journey of democracy 
""
Today realities are hard and challenges are tough  but we the
people of India have to give a positive response
