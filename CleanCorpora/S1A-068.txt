<I>
""
""
Uh this morning I was talking to you about  uh anxiety and
 uh my doctor has diagnosed uh anxiety uh neurosis
""
""
Yeah
""
Anxiety neurosis
""
""
Yes  uh be
really very difficult no
""
When there is an event  ahead of me like a journey or something
 it builds up
""
And any other certainty or any worry you know figures it out
""
And uh one doctor friend said something about the autonomic system
""
""
And  he
will conduct on me a thyroid test 
""
""
Yes
""
""
So what is that 
""
""
Actually doctor  anxiety nerosis is not very
uncommon disease
""
I would say  very common but it is not uncommon
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And  particularly influences everybody easily
is 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Whether they are physically weak whether they are  uh
travelling in a
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So  to get certain amount of worry and what the term we use
of that you set a 
""
So 
""
And the best way to succumb to it 
""
""
""
""
""
I see
""
""
And to avoid it the best reason I will give is that  you
should think yourself 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Just as last night I said that  get down at
Parliament Street at eleven  what will happen to me
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And then immedietly I questioned myself what can happen to me
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Nothing 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
 get a cab
""
See and go
""
""
Uhm
""
""
The best thing to avoid it that you reason it out
""
""
Like
""
""
Then after all what will be the result of this anxiety 
""
""
""
 the worst comes then
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And this  only increase your anxiety
""
But if you will reason it out 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
That these are the possibilities that can happen 
""
Okay I am prepared for it
""
""
Uh  uh
""
""
You know that a woman she is  apprehensive about
many things
""
What one can take from me
""
""
Yes
""
""
Oh this my small 
case it can go I won't worry about it
""
""
Yeah go and
""
""
You want my watch no okay
""
""
Gold chain I won't wear
""
""
No I won't wear
""
I I will not wear anything because physical hurt
""
Okay if  give it to him
""
""
Uhm
""
""
That is the best way
""
""
So  one way of avoiding
""
""
One way of avoiding
""
But if you have got this is functional anxiety
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
But if you have really some  uh medical problem that is to
be checked
""
For example that  thyroid
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Say for example  hyper thyroid people
""
""
Uhm
""
""
They get particular  anxiety and for that they do certain
tests of mainly that  T three T four
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Thyroid distribulating harmones in fractions  uhm
""
""
So those who have got the defiency of thyroid they will have more T
F H
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Means that their pituary body is going to  uh some extra
factor by producing more thyroid stimulating harmones
""
""
I see 
""
""
T three and T four are less  better indicator but T F H is
 to diagnose early T F H see T three and T four they
are directly related with hyper thyroid 
""
""
So it can have a physiological correlater as well as a
psychological one
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So  uh you have told me the way to fight the psychological
fear
""
""
 my way
""
""
And  uh the physiological thing will require some kind of
pathological test 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So I should go in for that 
""
""
Well if you feel that you really may have thyroid problem you
should go
""
But 
""
One is that loss of weight 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Number two is
""
""
Steep loss of weight
""
""
Yeah steep loss of
""
""
I have maintained my weight from 
""
""
 blood cell
""
""
""
 means hundred twenty
""
""
Yeah
""
Upper limit of the blood cell
""
""
So  I have neither of these symptoms
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
My I mean I have less weight but it has been constant for ten
years  like this
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Or around the sixty-three  uh kgs
""
""
Or maybe  less I don't remember but it is constant
""
""
""
""
""
And
""
""
And Dr Shastri you have seen me I don't think uh you notice
much 
""
""
""
""
""
 then there are other things that find
 in the finger
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
And then the 
 they are late symptons
""
""
I see
""
""
But early is the indication of the thyroid  rise in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
So actually 
I had a cardiac kind of uh thing so
""
They made me  test
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And they said  which means you
know there is some error somewhere twice I did it
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And 
and 
""
Maybe 
pain in my chest
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
So this might be atypical  uh when I sort of run
 So I am
a sort of that you know my breathing rate increases  otherwise there is no
problem and it comes down 
""
So  uh do you think I really have a problem there
""
""
This is I cannot anwer
""
""
Uh yeah
""
""
Say for example after the age of forty or forty-five  you
are arrested to  rise uh
 or running or
strenous exercises common people heart is taking more strength that is 
two words 
""
""
""
""
""
I see
""
""
And  so we diagnose it as a cardiac problems
""
You don't have to wait for angina
""
But if  is tested
""
circulation problem
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Only a minor degree of
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And then you are regulating the life  uh life in a better
way
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Mild exercises if you really  that vital
 capacity
""
You doesn't do as your doctor suggests
""
I will never say that  what your
cardiologist said is
""
""
 Yeah
""
You see 
""
""
Yeah
""
He suggested these tests he said first thyroid test 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
For this anxiety thing  one
word 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Then he said another test we will take
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And if necesary we will do angiography
""
""
Yeah 
""
Angiography is the last thing
""
I won't advice you to go through 
""
""
Lightly means
""
""
I know you will see the all process of that you are really a
cardiac patient to go through the  uh angiography
""
""
So that will depend on the kind of uh 
results that the  tests show
""
""
""
""
""
I hope so
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I am not a cardiologist  general
knowledge of a medical doctor
""
Something a methodologist I know a little more than uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Other discipline
""
""
The  uh intriguing think is that doctors don't
look at the  one
word 
""
They just look at the summary given by
""
So  uh and that doesn't show where the narrowing is
""
""
No that doesn't figure in the narrowing is
""
And you know that  test when a patient is really
prominent 
uhm  so that you can see can sometimes specifically in the angina when you
know might have cardiac effect
""
""
and in fact
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As a result of the effect
""
""
As a result of effect but that occurs only in those who have
got a serious 
""
""
""
""
""
 in a person
who has got minor problems
""
And then there are indicators that the doctor will ask you
immedietly to stop 
""
""
Yes of course
""
""
No no further tests should be  on him or her
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
He was uh  was present and he
monitored 
""
So I think we have several monitors like heart rate and blood
pressure and
""
""
Definitely 
""
""
But I overheard saying you know if change back to normal very
quickly
""
""
How is it
""
""
Like 
uh the mill 
""
If  uh twelve minutes thing
""
""
So I think  uh six seven minutes you know I was getting
restless 
""
""
""
""
""
You see on that question normally uh uh experts the
cardiologist should decide but for me  not tell you straight way
""
""
I see
""
""
See we have not don't being a cardiologist I hope so that I
am fully fit to answer this big question 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Uh if I am faithful to myself  getting
this question and it should come back to normal I would say that  a few
words 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You have got mild
""
""
Yeah
""
""
General common sense you can say
""
""
Right
""
You see 
""
""
See these days we are  getting more and more tests than
""
""
Well it is good that it is diagnosed it 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Because this should be done when and where the  one word
""
""
""
Well you could perhaps you know get back to diabetes  uh I am
a little affected  uh repeat I mean uh problem that
justification of that  for both of us
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
Actually my diabetes is under control
""
In the beginning I had no concept of calories and so on 
""
The usual notion given 
""
Now  uh you know for a year I I joined a diabetic clinic which
is exclusive for diabetics 
""
And the doctor you know uh  say he didn't say this like I
gathered from end to end so that I was not a serious case and  also allows
to  because the gap between
dinner and the breakfast is to be very long 
""
So the whole thing is that  uh you should control the quantity
of calories that you take 
""
So this is under control but I think over the years I have 
developed all kinds of psychological hangups and fears 
""
And this anxiety thing for  adrenil or something you
know
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Is discharge of its own 
""
And once or twice I had to cancel my air journey 
""
And uh once it so happened you know that kind of fun as you might
have to go to this university to pick up the 
""
And I said you know I am going to take an early morning flight to
Madras and then from Madras I have to take a plane to Tirichinapally and 
""
I don't want to do all these and  you know this builds up high
""
and panting and all that 
""
My son became nervous and around ten pm  there came a phone
call saying 
""
In those days the airlines people were a some kind of go slow or
non-coperation thing 
""
They said the flight is likely to be  uh delayed indefinitely
""
""
I see
""
""
I said 
""
He said 
""
I said 
""
He said 
""
And immedietly 
""
""
This is
""
""
All my anxiety 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn doctor I think that you should consult a psychiatrist 
 but in my own way I will say that psychiatrists create more
problems than solution
""
""
""
""
""
I know
""
""
More solution
""
So I said that you try to reason out within yourself that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
 getting a little psychological also
""
""
Is it psychological 
last month  I was told that I had to go to Japan
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
 and uh I was an invitee
of Japan government
""
I my passport has expired 
""
I had to get a visa and all that 
""
So in my you know  I
developed some pain 
""
And uh I thought it was my being kidney thing because diabetics
are likely to get  kidney and I had no time to go the
hospital because I had to go to the passport office
""
And I noticed that on fourteenth of  when the
passport was handed over to me at six pm that pain 
disappeared immedietly
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uh
""
But you  to Japan then
""
""
Ah I went to you know because you know I got executive class
ticket  uh Madras uh Hyderabad Madras Madras Singapore Singapore uh Tokyo
and then back to Singapore I made a stop over in Singapore 
""
In uh Tokyo myself and Nihalani presented they told me  deputy
chairperson
""
So I presided most of the sessions 
""
For two weeks and my contribution was valued and all that 
""
So I really enjoyed it
""
But this anxiety thing occur occasionaly there also
""
""
""
