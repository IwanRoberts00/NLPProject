<I>
Uh this morning I was talking to you about uh anxiety and
 uh my doctor has diagnosed uh anxiety uh neurosis
Yeah
Anxiety neurosis
Yes uh I am prone to worrying and uh it can uh be
really very difficult no
When there is an event ahead of me like a journey or something
 it builds up
And any other certainty or any worry you know figures it out
And uh one doctor friend said something about the autonomic system
And uh my cardiologist says that uh when I have time he
will conduct on me a thyroid test 
Yes
So what is that 
Actually doctor Gup anxiety nerosis is not very
uncommon disease
I would say it's very common but it is not uncommon
Uhm
And this's particularly influences everybody easily
is you will feel that you are vulnerable to the evil 
Uhm uhm
Whether they are physically weak whether they are uh
travelling in a
Uhm 
So to get certain amount of worry and what the term we use
of that you set a uh of small small things uh um 
So it's not uncommon 
And the best way to succumb to it is not to succumb to it 
 Uh um 
I see
And to avoid it the best reason I will give is that you
should think yourself that after all what is going to happen to me 
Uhm 
Just as last night I said that I'll get down at
Parliament Street at eleven O'clock what will happen to me
Uhm 
And then immedietly I questioned myself what can happen to me
Uhm 
Nothing 
Uhm
 I'll get a cab
See and go
Uhm
The best thing to avoid it that you reason it out
Like
Then after all what will be the result of this anxiety 
 one word 
 What'll be the worst comes then
Yeah
Yeah
And this only increase your anxiety
But if you will reason it out 
Yeah 
That these are the possibilities that can happen 
Okay I am prepared for it
Uh uh
You know that a woman she is a apprehensive about
many things
What one can take from me
Yes
Oh this my small attache e-acute 
case it can go I won't worry about it
Yeah go and
You want my watch no okay
Gold chain I won't wear
No I won't wear
I I will not wear anything because physical hurt
Okay if I've got the cash I'll give it to him
Uhm
That is the best way
So that's one way of avoiding
One way of avoiding
But if you have got this is functional anxiety
Ah ha
But if you have really some uh medical problem that is to
be checked
For example that thyroid
Yeah
Say for example hyper thyroid people
Uhm
They get particular anxiety and for that they do certain
tests of mainly that T three T four
Uhm
Thyroid distribulating harmones in fractions uhm
 and T F H 
So those who have got the defiency of thyroid they will have more T
F H
 Uhm 
Ah ha
Means that their pituary body is going to uh some extra
factor by producing more thyroid stimulating harmones
I see 
T three and T four are less better indicator but T F H is
 good indicator to diagnose early T F H see T three and T four they
are directly related with hyper thyroid 
So it can have a physiological correlater as well as a
psychological one
Yeah and most of the time it is psychological 
So uh you have told me the way to fight the psychological
fear
 That's my way
And uh the physiological thing will require some kind of
pathological test 
Yeah 
So I should go in for that 
Well if you feel that you really may have thyroid problem you
should go
But for thyroid problem there are one two indications 
One is that loss of weight 
Uhm
Number two is
Steep loss of weight
Yeah steep loss of
I have maintained my weight from first 
 And uh rise in one word blood cell
 One word means hundred twenty
Yeah
Upper limit of the blood cell
So I have neither of these symptoms
Yeah 
My I mean I have less weight but it has been constant for ten
years uhm like this
 Uhm 
Yeah
Or around the sixty-three uhm for uh kgs
Or maybe it's less I don't remember but it is constant
 Uhm 
And
And Dr Shastri you have seen me I don't think uh you notice
much difference 
 
 No no no difference 
 And then then there are other things that find
 one word in the finger
Ah ha
And then the one word falling here the pro 
 one word of one word they are late symptons
I see
But early is the indication of the thyroid rise in the
 I see a few words 
 I see 
Uhm uhm 
So actually uh I have been a diabetic and uh uhm 
I had a cardiac kind of uh thing so
They made me do the uh this one word test
Yeah 
And they said it's positive which means you
know there is some error somewhere twice I did it
Uhm uhm
And uh my physicain wants to do it again An 
and maybe I am mixing up several symptoms 
Maybe that's not serious because I don't get any 
pain in my chest
Uhm uhm
So this might be atypical but uh when I sort of run
 for example yesterday I had to run a bit to catch a bus So I am
a sort of that you know my breathing rate increases otherwise there is no
problem and it comes down uh after sometime 
So uh do you think I really have a problem there
This is I cannot anwer
Uh yeah
Say for example after the age of forty or forty-five you
are arrested to just uh this is sort of breath like rise rise uh
 and get getting up by stairs uhm or running or
strenous exercises common people heart is taking more strength that is 
two words 
 Uhm 
I see
And so we diagnose it as a cardiac problems
You don't have to wait for angina
But if you've two times your two words is tested
 two words which means that you've a minor degree of 
circulation problem
Ah ha
Only a minor degree of
Yeah
And then you are regulating the life uh life in a better
way
Yeah
Mild exercises if you really two words that vital
 capacity
You doesn't do as your doctor suggests
I will never say that you don't do what your
cardiologist said is
 Yeah
You see 
Yeah
He suggested these tests he said first thyroid test 
Uhm
For this anxiety thing one word one
word 
 Yeah 
Uhm
Then he said another test we will take
Uhm uhm
And if necesary we will do angiography
Yeah 
Angiography is the last thing
I won't advice you to go through lightly 
Lightly means
I know you will see the all process of that you are really a
cardiac patient to go through the uh angiography
So that will depend on the kind of uh yeah 
results that the one word tests show
 Yeah 
I hope so
Yeah
I am not a cardiologist but I have a general
knowledge of a medical doctor
Something a methodologist I know a little more than uh 
 But they do 
Yeah
Other discipline
The set of uh intriguing think is that doctors don't
look at the the the fregment test uh you know print out very one
word you know 
They just look at the summary given by
So uh and that doesn't show where the narrowing is
No that doesn't figure in the narrowing is
And you know that regular test when a patient is really
prominent one word of narrowing the process 
uhm so that you can see can sometimes specifically in the angina when you
know might have cardiac effect
 A a and uh in faction uhm 
and in fact
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
As a result of the effect
As a result of effect but that occurs only in those who have
got a serious two words 
 I think 
 They will not ordinarily occur in a person
who has got minor problems
And then there are indicators that the doctor will ask you
immedietly to stop 
Yes of course
No no further tests should be done on him or her
 Yeah 
Yeah
He was uh an M D young and and he was present and he
monitored 
So I think we have several monitors like heart rate and blood
pressure and
Definitely 
But I overheard saying you know if change back to normal very
quickly
How is it
Like they accelerate the pace of the yeah 
uh the mill 
If it's twenty hours twenty uh twelve minutes thing
So I think uh six seven minutes you know I was getting
restless and then uh they slowed it down 
 Yeah 
You see on that question normally uh uh experts the
cardiologist should decide but for me I'll not tell you straight way
I see
See we have not don't being a cardiologist I hope so that I
am fully fit to answer this big question 
Yeah
Uh if I am faithful to myself but if I am getting
this question and it should come back to normal I would say that a few
words 
Yeah
You have got mild
Yeah
General common sense you can say
Right
You see 
See these days we are getting more and more tests than
Well it is good that it is diagnosed it 
Yeah
Because this should be done when and where the one word
 expect 
 
Well you could perhaps you know get back to diabetes uh I am
a little affected Uhm if you can uh repeat I mean uh problem that
justification of that one word uh one word for both of us
Yeah 
Actually my diabetes is under control
In the beginning I had no concept of calories and so on 
The usual notion given two words sweet 
Now uh you know for a year I I joined a diabetic clinic which
is exclusive for diabetics 
And the doctor you know uh say he didn't say this like I
gathered from end to end so that I was not a serious case and also allows
to uh go two words go and prepare because the gap between
dinner and the breakfast is to be very long 
So the whole thing is that uh you should control the quantity
of calories that you take rather than uh actual items 
So this is under control but I think over the years I have 
developed all kinds of psychological hangups and fears 
And this anxiety thing for adra adrenil or something you
know
Yeah
Is discharge of its own 
And once or twice I had to cancel my air journey 
And uh once it so happened you know that kind of fun as you might
have to go to this university to pick up the one or two words 
And I said you know I am going to take an early morning flight to
Madras and then from Madras I have to take a plane to Tirichinapally and 
I don't want to do all these and you know this builds up high
 raised height of anxiety and the second that I start booming 
and panting and all that 
My son became nervous and around ten pm there came a phone
call saying Are you travelling to Madras tomorrow 
In those days the airlines people were a some kind of go slow or
non-coperation thing 
They said the flight is likely to be uh delayed indefinitely
I see
I said Can I cancel it 
He said Yes 
I said Do I have to pay any charge 
He said no 
And immedietly immedietly this thing was over 
This is
All my anxiety was over 
 
 Ah 
 Laughs 
Uhn doctor I think that you should consult a psychiatrist 
 uhm but in my own way I will say that psychiatrists create more
problems than solution
 Uhm 
I know
More solution
So I said that you try to reason out within yourself that 
 yeah after all why should you have this 
 Yeah 
Yeah
 It's getting a little psychological also
Is it psychological uh and uh like uh 
last month I was told that I had to go to Japan
 Uh 
Uhm
 It's a rare opportunity and uh I was an invitee
of Japan government
I my passport has expired 
I had to get a visa and all that 
So in my you know uh waist on the right hand side I
developed some pain laughter 
And uh I thought it was my being kidney thing because diabetics
are likely to get uh kidney and I had no time to go the
hospital because I had to go to the passport office
And I noticed that on fourteenth of this June when the
passport was handed over to me at six pm that pain dis dis 
disappeared immedietly
 Uh 
Uhm uh
But you go went to Japan then
Ah I went to you know because you know I got executive class
ticket uh Madras uh Hyderabad Madras Madras Singapore Singapore uh Tokyo
and then back to Singapore I made a stop over in Singapore 
In uh Tokyo myself and Nihalani presented they told me deputy
chairperson
So I presided most of the sessions uh 
For two weeks and my contribution was valued and all that 
So I really enjoyed it
But this anxiety thing occur occasionaly there also
 Uh
