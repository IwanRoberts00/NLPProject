Uh this morning I was talking to you about  uh anxiety and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
really very difficult no
""
""
 it builds up
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uncommon disease
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  to get certain amount of worry and what the term we use
of that you set a 
""
""
""
And the best way to succumb to it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
should think yourself 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Just as last night I said that  get down at
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then after all what will be the result of this anxiety 
""
""
""
 the worst comes then
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
many things
""
What one can take from me
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
case it can go I won't worry about it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
That is the best way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
But if you have really some  uh medical problem that is to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
factor by producing more thyroid stimulating harmones
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are directly related with hyper thyroid 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  uh you have told me the way to fight the psychological
fear
""
""
""
""
""
And  uh the physiological thing will require some kind of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well if you feel that you really may have thyroid problem you
""
""
But 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 blood cell
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
My I mean I have less weight but it has been constant for ten
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And
""
""
""
much 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in the finger
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But early is the indication of the thyroid  rise in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They made me  test
""
""
""
""
""
""
know there is some error somewhere twice I did it
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
""
and 
""
Maybe 
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
""
 So I am
""
problem and it comes down 
""
""
""
""
This is I cannot anwer
""
""
""
""
""
""
are arrested to  rise uh
 or running or
""
two words 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Only a minor degree of
""
""
""
""
""
""
way
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I will never say that  what your
""
""
""
""
""
You see 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
word 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then he said another test we will take
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And if necesary we will do angiography
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I know you will see the all process of that you are really a
""
""
""
So that will depend on the kind of uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I am not a cardiologist  general
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
look at the  one
""
""
They just look at the summary given by
""
So  uh and that doesn't show where the narrowing is
""
""
No that doesn't figure in the narrowing is
""
""
""
uhm  so that you can see can sometimes specifically in the angina when you
know might have cardiac effect
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
got a serious 
""
""
""
""
""
 in a person
who has got minor problems
""
""
immedietly to stop 
""
""
Yes of course
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I think we have several monitors like heart rate and blood
pressure and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh the mill 
""
""
""
""
""
restless 
""
""
""
""
""
""
cardiologist should decide but for me  not tell you straight way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
words 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You have got mild
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
justification of that  for both of us
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In the beginning I had no concept of calories and so on 
""
""
""
Now  uh you know for a year I I joined a diabetic clinic which
is exclusive for diabetics 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this is under control but I think over the years I have 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I said you know I am going to take an early morning flight to
""
""
I don't want to do all these and  you know this builds up high
""
""
""
""
call saying 
""
