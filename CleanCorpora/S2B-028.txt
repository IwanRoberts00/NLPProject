 Music 
 Music this is the most essential factor in
the very existence of man 
But what is music ?
Dictionary defines music as the art of
expression in sound in harmony and melody 
So music is not mere noise it is a series of melodious and
harmonious sounds very pleasing to the ear 
So melodious and harmonious sounds very pleasing to the ear
 make music 
These melodious sounds also have rhythm in it 
Music must have been born even before the language 
When man came into being on this earth he must have heard many
melodious sounds around him The rippling sound of water 
waves of sea chirping of birds rustling of leaves 
all these sweet sounds probably gave him the knowledge of musical note
He must have later on given names to these musical notes 
Every human being is born with an ear for music and loves
to sing singing 
Little children illiterate adivasis village women and
all those who sing but have never made a proper study of music are
hardly aware that the sweet melodious sounds that they are producing 
are composed of seven musical notes 
Folk songs devotional songs film music gazal 
thumri classical music even western music all these different
types of music are composed of seven basic musical notes 
Call them do re mi pha so la ti or
 sa re ga ma pa dha ni 
Whether it is Eastern music or Western music these seven
musical notes are universally accepted 
After the completion of these seven notes the second octave
begins 
Let us talk about Indian music sa re ga 
ma pa dha ni are basic seven notes called
 shudha swaras 
There are five more notes in between these basic notes 
called komal and tivra notes 
Thus all music has these twelve basic notes 
Let us take an example of a very popular but very simple
 bhajan that every Indian can sing Raghupati
Raghav Rajaram 
How many of us know of what musical notes this simple
 bhajan is composed of ?
Let us see bhajan 
Let us hear the same tune now on guitar guitar being
played 
The same musical notes are either vocally produced or they
are played on the instrument to produce the same tune 
It is indeed very interesting to know who created these musical
notes 
About the origin of music and the seven musical notes there
are many stories all different stories in different countries 
different languages and different religion 
Hindus believe that Brahmadeva created music gave this
art to Shankar who handed it over to Saraswati who is considered 
as the goddess of fine arts 
Later Narad did penance or tapascharya and
received the art of music from Saraswati 
Narad then taught music to Gandharvas Kinnaras and Apsaras
Bharatmuni the great sage is responsible for bringing music
on this earth 
Even in the oldest of scriptures we find the mention of music
According to one European story this world was originally
created without music 
This world was dry drab and very uninteresting 
Man and woman were unhappy and could not make love in this
atmosphere 
So God created seven beautiful melodious musical notes to
make this world enchanting and lovable 
In Arabian history it is believed that music originated 
from the bird bulbul 
According to the African sage Ifari man and woman were
bathing in a beautiful lake and their movements in the water created
lovely sweet sounds 
These melodious sounds created in the water are the origin of
music 
Well known musicologist Rinsobols also believed that
musical notes have originated from melodious sounds created in
the ripples of water 
The Japanese scholar Shikoba says in his book that
music is has originated in heaven not on
this earth 
When man and woman were created by the god they already had the
knowledge of music 
So music is always considered to be divine 
The Western scholar Freud always believed that origin of
music has its base in the psychology of human being sounds
The sounds uttered by the child sounds 
crying laughing shouting are learnt by the child
itself 
Nobody teaches the child to cry or to laugh 
Similarly the musical notes are created by the man himself 
when he was feeling happy and relaxed sound 
Another Western historian says that man has created music 
through his wisdom and intelligence 
Man has always been searching different ways to entice the
woman 
So he has tried to attract her by creating different
sweet melodious sounds and thus music came into being 
Well known Indian scholar Damodar Pandit says that the seven
notes of music are created by imitating the sounds of different birds
and animals 
The basic note sa is taken from peacock
 re from chatak ga from
sheep ma from kraunch or crane pa
 from koel dha 
from frog and ni from elephant 
It is also believed that as seven colours are emitted by
sunlight so the seven musical notes are emitted from Om
 
 Om is one letter word containing three
letters a oo and ma 
These three letters symbolise energy 
 A symbolises creation or creator Brahma
 Oo symbolises protector Vishnu and
 Ma symbolises destroyer Mahesh 
All these three energies together form the trinity or
Trimurti Parameshwar 
The basic original sound used in Vedas is Om
 
The vibration produced by the correct utterance of this word
 Om are very very powerful and the correct
utterance of Om can awaken the latent energy of the
man 
The seven musical notes emanate from this one letter word
 Om 
And the correct utterance and repeatedly utterance of
 Om and the pursuit of Om can
give the enlightenment of music 
In Indian music the seven musical notes are called 
Shadaja rishabha gandhar madhyam pancham dhaivat and
nishad 
Who gave these names to these seven musical notes is really a
mystery 
 Shadaja means creator of six notes 
The vocal singer fixes his basic note sa
 according to the capacity of his vocal cords and from this
basic sa he gives the ascent in ascending order 
the next six notes re ga ma pa dha 
and ni 
Before fixing the position of the seven notes one believed in
twenty-two shrutis 
Sounds useful to create music were first called 
shrutis 
From the twenty-two shrutis in one octave 
seven were chosen and names were given to them 
 Shadaja madhyam and pancham 
 have four shrutis each nishad gandhar
 have two shrutis each 
 Rishabha and dhaivata have
three shrutis each 
During the vedic period only three musical notes were used
 they were called udaatta anudaatta and 
swaritta or prathama dwitiya and 
tritiya 
They were equivalent to gandhara rishabha 
and shadaja 
A little later one more note a little higher than these
notes was used while chanting the Vedas 
It was equivalent to madhyam 
Later on three more notes equivalent to pancham 
dhaivata and nishad were added 
During Panini's time these seven shudhha
 musical notes were already accepted 
Later on five more notes were added 
They were in between these seven notes 
No new names were given to them but they were called 
 re komal ga komal ma tivra dha komal and 
ni komal 
Thus these twelve music notes were accepted and all
music is composed of these twelve musical notes 
They are little lower or little higher than the shuddha
 notes 
So today we have these twelve basic musical notes 
Music is normally composed of three octaves each containing
twenty-two shrutis 
The middle octave is called madhya saptak the
lower octave is called mandra saptak and the higher
octave is called tivra saptak 
Different permutations and combinations of these musical notes 
produce different moods different ragas different
music all very pleasing to the ear 
Musical notes are like flowers in a garden 
Each flower has a different colour different aroma 
different beauty and different splendour 
Each flower is beautiful 
One can choose different flowers from this garden of musical notes
 and form thousands of varieties of beautiful bouquets 
This music bestows upon the human mind the heavenly bliss 
and creates a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere for which the human
being strives music
