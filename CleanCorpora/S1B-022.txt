The last phases of the election campaign  coming
""
""
It has been a tragic election in a way 
""
Introductive tragically 
""
""
""
""
With uh 
""
""
 The Times Of India
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or do you think  ?
""
""
""
""
I think the current election is perhaps the most sensitised
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
intended to take 
""
And make sure that the country would get the election which it is
""
""
And as far as  concerned anything which comes in the
""
""
""
If unfortunately that produces controversy  say
""
""
""
Well I think Dileepji wanted to raise the question of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
entire political class seems to be  ranged against the election
commissioner 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh is it because uh  to take
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh Dileep I  must apologise for not responding to the
""
system 
""
""
will say  is a certain
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
you are perfectly right in saying that I  tried to put right whatever was
""
""
""
Uh at a rather faster phase then what the system could digest 
""
""
constitutional the representation of the people  clothed the
election commission 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But I don't always wait and stand until the guidance is fully
""
""
""
""
""
ability
""
""
""
""
""
Belief has ended with broader  rot which has set
""
""
""
to remove any obstacle in the free and fair elections 
""
But what it counts  around now after your various action
postponing the election counter manding the election 
""
It seems you have assigned to yourself the role of a  supreme
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Correct but they hear everything
""
""
No no no  not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
power not to hear anybody ?
""
""
No no  I was not suggesting
""
""
little mere time when it is justified 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that if the time is available
and the oppurtunity is available  the courses of natural justice must all
be followed
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then  it is not always possible to go through hearings and what
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This counter manding decisions are not taken against any candidate
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Implications are serious 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No  that
if booth capturing happens the election commission  and if I may say so
""
""
""
""
After hearing the party
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I do not want to disagree with you at any stage 
""
That a right of ordinary justice natural justice demands that
""
""
But in that case somebody might even argue if I countermand the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Mr Seshan you are trying to set up conventions 
""
Which are 
""
""
You are creating political instability by  deciding
decision one  taking
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh the fact that you said  you counteremanded X number of uh
""
""
Alright elections in these constituencies 
""
Later you came round to say 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the other  uh that has been raised by a number
""
 the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
available 
""
Whether it is uh  officers at higher level officers at the
""
stations 
""
""
level 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But which they are not those of  if I may use very bad word
""
""
""
""
""
checks and balances built-in  in order to ensure that somebody say so if
""
""
This is as far as it concern
""
""
Now you raise the other question you countermanded  and
then you are hearing people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the election commission  is in two minds about its own decisions
""
As far as I am concerned  those five counteremanding decisions
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No  I I don't concede that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Look here  chief election commissioners office in the
state
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I am mentioning again 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I have sent out three hundred central officers 
""
Now you might well ask what is this enormous waste of resources
and money to sent three hundred observers 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They sent all the time
""
""
""
""
""
""
They were
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
throughout the country 
""
""
""
""
""
""
after deploying three hundred
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
they were smooth in Madhya Pradesh  they were smooth in Andhra Pradesh
except for minor cases here and there 
""
""
""
""
""
Now you come to the core area of U P and Bihar 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
listenning to a particular  political group
""
""
No no  look I have mentioned again and let me again submit
""
""
