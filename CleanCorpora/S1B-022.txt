<I>
The last phases of the election campaign are coming
upon us very soon 
It has been a tragic election in a way 
Introductive tragically 
And we are now approaching the last phases 
 phase of the election 
With uh me this evening is a very interesting panel 
We have our the chief election commissioner Mr Seshan and
 we've Dileep Padgaonkar editor of The Times Of India
 and we have Prabhu Chawla a great one word of
 Indian Express and I'm Nihal Singh a
columnist 
Uh Mr Seshan if I might ask a rather genuine question to
begin with 
You have proved to be the most controversial chief election
commissioner in India's history 
Uh do you think it is because of the prevailing political
climate ?
Or do you think it is because of your personality ?
Or do you think it's the combination of both ?
I think my good fortunes are related to several factors 
I think the current election is perhaps the most sensitised
election as I've been saying for the last two three months of
all the election that have been held in this country 
Uh certain things have improved certain things have not
improved 
Of course you ask the question which I'm a little at a
loss of word to answer am I controversial ?
I remember telling somebody very recently and I would like to
repeat that that I was not intending to be a very soft aids weapon of
doing this work 
I had uh cautioned everybody that the election commission
intended to take it's work seriously 
And make sure that the country would get the election which it is
entitle to which is a fair and free election 
And as far as I'm concerned anything which comes in the
way of a fair and free election it's a good object to be
satisfied 
If unfortunately that produces controversy I'll say
 two words I've sinned 
Well I think Dileepji wanted to raise the question of the
abruptness of some of the decision no I how they were taken
 ?
 No I 
No I I did want to take off from where you left 
To say that uh we have here a situation where the 
entire political class seems to be ranged against the election
commissioner 
And I I have been trying very hard to find out how he's
 achieved this remarkable feat in this remarkable period of time
Uh is it because uh not just that you wanted to to take
this election seriously but also that the rot in the electoral process
that stretch in such a long time ago
Did you expect to stand it in one go so to speak ?
Uh Dileep I must apologise for not responding to the
statement you made about what did you say the rot which is set into the
system 
In my own rather limited way I've been saying and I
will say that what had happened as I mentioned before is a certain
loss of credibility in the election systems spread all over the country 
And it's loss merely is not a question of losing faith in
election in one small part of the country or the other 
The entire system's credibility is at stake 
Now you put it in stronger language I am by training and
otherwise not accustom to using harsh language 
So my answer to your question would be that uh uh may be
you are perfectly right in saying that I tried to put right whatever was
in my view not right or whatever is in the country's view not right
Uh at a rather faster phase then what the system could digest 
But all that I can tell you is that the founding fathers in the
constitutional the representation of the people rank clothed the
election commission with an abundance of powers 
Which the lordships in the supreme court repeatedly replace it
until these are power 
As one set of lordship once said it is not as if the
election commission so one word in a difficult situation hold
its hands and fold in prayer and say good Lord give me guidence what to
do 
Yet I do even now pray to god for guidence very often 
But I don't always wait and stand until the guidance is fully
available in writing 
I should act 
This I have made clear and I have acted to the best of my
ability
No Mr Seshan I am raising a different question all together
Belief has ended with broader question of rot which has set
into the system 
But I rightly put in the beginning that you were determined to 
to remove any obstacle in the free and fair elections 
But what it counts around now after your various action
postponing the election counter manding the election 
It seems you have assigned to yourself the role of a supreme
court judge of India 
Where you don't hear anybody 
You deliver justice without telling anybody what are the cause
for delivering this particular kind of justice
 You're giving a judgement saying you're 
hang 
When somebody protest then you say come here and 
I'll hear you 
What is now that is trying the credibility of situation is your
one sense sided decision making 
You have not heard anybody 
You see in a political democracy dialogue is an 
ess essential ingre ingredient 
 of a political system 
And you're just sacrificing the dialogues at all 
Well uh Prabhu all the time I say is that I indoubtely
agree with you
You said you're a supreme court judge doing
various things 
 I'm equated to a supreme court
Correct but they hear everything
No no no I'm not
 You're not hearing like supreme court
No no no I'm not denying in the least that the right
 natural right of justice of being heard ought to be available 
But I can only go by the rule book which parliament has handed
me down 
In certain places what does it say for example if I may at the
risk of uh of of of wasting listeners time mention in fact
Yes you have to waste listeners time
No I I
No no no no
I am not
No no no
I was not suggesting that you
Let me complete first because you have been when you are
quoting the parliament 
 Is the has the parliament given you
power not to hear anybody ?
No no please no I was not I was not suggesting
 in the least that your question was a waste of time I said I'm
 going to quote a section of law which could tantamount to spending a
little mere time when it is justified 
It says if the election commission is satisfied it can
do so and so so and so in appropriate place 
Now I don't want to get into again a legal argument for the
question
 You're perfectly right that if the time is available
and the oppurtunity is available the courses of natural justice must all
be followed
I have no disagreement with that at all 
But if you had to take a decision which have to be taken 
 in within hours if not less than hour 
Then it is not always possible to go through hearings and what
not 
Number two is that where the proof is abstractedly available
 without necessarily listening to but it is not
For example you refer to counter manding 
This counter manding decisions are not taken against any candidate
It is against the state or place in a particular constituency 
 A few words 
But does it what are the implications of counter manding
Implications are serious 
But
If you cannot hear the party
No parliament in nineteen eighty-nine decided that
if booth capturing happens the election commission and if I may say so
with great respect it doesn't say election commission may it says
 the election commission shall countermand the election 
After hearing the party
No he says not hearing the party 
 No no 
Let me again mention this to you that where a situation has
produced evidence adequate enough to say that hearing is not necessary I
feel it called upon I feel called upon to take a decision 
I mean I don't disagree with you
I do not want to disagree with you at any stage 
That a right of ordinary justice natural justice demands that
somebody should be heard who is likely to be affected 
But in that case somebody might even argue if I countermand the
election in a particular constituency I should hear all the people 
Why only the candidates ?
If I countermand the election in constituency X then 
surely I should hear all the people in that and not merely the twenty thirty
forty candidates who have filled up I I mean who have been nominated
by the
Mr Seshan you are trying to set up conventions 
Which are creat which are creating 
 more problem
You are creating political instability by deciding
decision one taking one decision in the morning taking
some other decisions two days later
 May I may I put it more
specifically this point 
Uh the fact that you said you counteremanded X number of uh
 consitituencies
Alright elections in these constituencies 
Later you came round to say well I'm 
reconsidering my decisions 
Now that leaves you open to a lot of criticism and also it 
 it intr introduces instable 
instability in the political set-up 
That is one point
And the other is uh that has been raised by a number
of parties is that you are supposed to have told one delegation that
 as far as election officer's reports are concerned the
days those days are over now that is how it's been
reported 
Maybe you would like to answer this question 
 Well let me answer the second part first 
And uh I I I'll come up to a little later as far as
the question of total dependability of the official heirarchy of
officers to be impartial in all that they do is regretably no longer
available 
Whether it is uh officers at higher level officers at the
lower level or one word work reciding in polling offices and polling
stations 
People who work as magistrates and others people at higher
level district election officers and still higher 
I may say with all the humility I possess 
In all the humility I possess that the point of time at which 
one could say without asking any question that this report would be totally
impartial 
Any content mistakes of facts which are genuinely mistakes of fact
But which they are not those of if I may use very bad word
committed people is no longer available 
This I did mention to more than one political party 
But we have tried to make sure that there are enough
checks and balances built-in in order to ensure that somebody say so if
not adequate for taking an action 
This is as far as it concern
Now you raise the other question you countermanded and
then you are hearing people
Yes 
Does this create the instability 
It certainly creates doubts in the minds of people whether
the election commission is in two minds about its own decisions
As far as I am concerned those five counteremanding decisions
were taken with a full sense of responsibility after analyzing the status
and hundreds and hundreds of reports which were received on the twentieth
There was official report they were none of the
official report
No I'm sorry I I don't concede that
statement to you 
I don't concede the fore factual possession to you 
You may be referring to report from a certain set of offices like
Look here chief election commissioners office in the
state
 I'm again mentioning you
 You've the returning officer in the state
 I'm mentioning it you
I have reports of the returning officers 
I have reports of the chief electoral officer
Recommending rec recommending 
 this countermanding 
Look I I I'm sorry
I am not going into individual specifics 
I am mentioning again 
In coming to certain conclusions we are not taking into
account or failing to take into account any kinds of valid information
I will tell you we have returning officers reports 
We have chief electoral officers reports 
I have sent out three hundred central officers 
Now you might well ask what is this enormous waste of resources
and money to sent three hundred observers 
Now what was behind the sending of observer somebody could
have asked this question 
Why do you have to sent central observers and state observers
They sent all the time
Last time we had 
 They are not sent all the time 
They were
Not three hundred but hundred a few words 
 I'm may I mention with all great
respect that last time around a total of seventy-five people were deployed
throughout the country 
This time I deployed three hundred not because I would like supply
to deploy more
Therefore the election has not been smooth even
after deploying three hundred
No no I don't recommend that 
 Election has been 
 I will let me tell you the elections were smooth in
Haryana 
They were smooth in Himachal they were smooth in Rajasthan 
they were smooth in Madhya Pradesh they were smooth in Andhra Pradesh
except for minor cases here and there 
They were good in Andaman they were good in Lakshadweep 
They were largely good in West Bengal 
Now you come to the core area of U P and Bihar 
We get into areas of greater and greater worry 
I won't use any other word 
We get into areas of greater and greater worry 
 That's why there is some charge that you are
listenning to a particular political group
No no look I have mentioned again and let me again submit
to you that if at the thick of the game people get ang 
 angry against the umpire 
I am sorry the umpire will have to put with it
