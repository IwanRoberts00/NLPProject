The last phases of the election campaign  coming
upon us 
""
It has been a tragic election in a way 
""
Introductive tragically 
""
And 
""
""
With uh 
""
We have our  and
 The Times Of India
 of
 a
columnist 
""
Uh Mr Seshan  a rather genuine question to
begin with 
""
You have proved to be the most controversial chief election
commissioner in 
""
Uh do you think it is because of the prevailing  political
climate  ?
""
Or do you think it is because of your personality  ?
""
Or do you think  ?
""
""
I think my good fortunes are related to several factors 
""
I think the current election is perhaps the most sensitised
election as  of
all the election that have been held in this country 
""
Uh certain things have improved  certain things have not
improved 
""
Of course you ask the question which  at a
loss of word to answer am I controversial  ?
""
I remember telling somebody very recently  and I would like to
repeat that that  I was not intending to be a very soft aids weapon of
doing this work 
""
I had uh  that the election commission
intended to take 
""
And make sure that the country would get the election which it is
entitle to which is a fair and free election 
""
And as far as  concerned anything which comes in the
way of a fair and free election  to be
satisfied 
""
If unfortunately that produces controversy  say
""
""
""
Well I think Dileepji wanted to raise the question of the
abruptness of some of the decision  how they were taken
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
No I I did want to take off from where you left 
""
To say that uh 
entire political class seems to be  ranged against the election
commissioner 
""
And I  he's
 period of time
""
""
Uh is it because uh  to take
this election seriously  but also that the rot in the electoral process
that stretch in such a long time ago
""
Did you expect to stand it  one go so to speak ?
""
""
Uh Dileep I  must apologise for not responding to the
statement you made about  what did you say the rot which is set into the
system 
""
In my own  been saying and I
will say  is a certain
loss of credibility in the election systems spread all over the country 
""
And  loss merely is not a question of losing faith in
election in one small part of the country or the other 
""
The entire 
""
Now  I am by training and
otherwise not accustom to using harsh language 
""
So  uh uh may be
you are perfectly right in saying that I  tried to put right whatever was
in my view not right or whatever is in the  view not right
""
""
Uh at a rather faster phase then what the system could digest 
""
But all that I can tell you is  that the founding fathers in the
constitutional the representation of the people  clothed the
election commission 
""
Which the lordships in the supreme court repeatedly replace it
until these are power 
""
As one set of lordship once said  it is not as if the
election commission  in a difficult situation hold
its hands and fold in prayer and say good Lord  give me guidence what to
do 
""
Yet 
""
But I don't always wait and stand until the guidance is fully
available in writing 
""
I should act 
""
This I have made clear and I  have acted to the best of my
ability
""
""
No Mr Seshan I am raising a different question all together
""
""
Belief has ended with broader  rot which has set
into the system 
""
But I rightly put in the beginning that you were determined to 
to remove any obstacle in the free and fair elections 
""
But what it counts  around now after your various action
postponing the election counter manding the election 
""
It seems you have assigned to yourself the role of a  supreme
court judge of India 
""
Where you don't hear anybody 
""
You deliver justice  without telling anybody what are the cause
for delivering this particular kind of justice
""
""
hang 
""
When somebody protest then you say 
I'll 
""
What is now that is trying the credibility of situation is  your
one 
""
You have not heard anybody 
""
You see 
ess 
""
""
And 
""
""
Well uh  Prabhu all the time I say is that I indoubtely
agree with you
""
You said  a supreme court judge doing
various things 
""
 equated to a supreme court
""
""
Correct but they hear everything
""
""
No no no  not
""
""
 not hearing like supreme court
""
""
No no no  not denying in the least that the right
""
""
But  I can only go by the rule book which parliament has handed
me down 
""
In certain places what does it say for example if I may  at the
risk of uh of of of wasting listeners time  mention in fact
""
""
Yes you have to waste listeners time
""
""
No I I
""
""
No no no no
""
""
I am not
""
""
No no no
""
""
I was not suggesting that you
""
""
Let me complete first because you have been  when you are
quoting the parliament 
""
 parliament given you
power not to hear anybody ?
""
""
No no  I was not suggesting
 I'm
 which could tantamount to spending a
little mere time when it is justified 
""
It says  it can
do so and so so and so 
""
Now  I don't want to get into again a legal argument for the
question
""
 that if the time is available
and the oppurtunity is available  the courses of natural justice must all
be followed
""
I have no disagreement with that at all 
""
But if you had to take a decision 
""
""
Then  it is not always possible to go through hearings and what
not 
""
Number two  is that where the proof is abstractedly available
 without necessarily listening to but it is not
""
For example you refer to counter manding 
""
This counter manding decisions are not taken against any candidate
""
""
It is against the state or place in a particular constituency 
""
""
""
""
""
But does it  what are the implications of counter manding
""
""
Implications are serious 
""
But
""
""
If you cannot hear the party
""
""
No  that
if booth capturing happens the election commission  and if I may say so
with great respect  it says
""
""
""
After hearing the party
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
""
Let me again mention this to you that where a situation has
produced evidence adequate enough  to say that hearing is not necessary I
feel it 
""
I mean I don't disagree with you
""
I do not want to disagree with you at any stage 
""
That a right of ordinary justice natural justice demands that
somebody should be heard who is likely to be affected 
""
But in that case somebody might even argue if I countermand the
election in a particular constituency I should hear all the people 
""
Why only the candidates  ?
""
If I countermand the election in constituency X 
surely I should hear all the people in that and not merely the twenty thirty
forty candidates who have filled up  been nominated
by the
""
""
Mr Seshan you are trying to set up conventions 
""
Which are 
 more problem
""
You are creating political instability by  deciding
decision one  taking
some other decisions two days later
""
""
 put it more
specifically this point 
""
Uh the fact that you said  you counteremanded X number of uh
 consitituencies
""
Alright elections in these constituencies 
""
Later you came round to say 
reconsidering my decisions 
""
Now 
""
instability 
""
That is one point
""
And the other  uh that has been raised by a number
of parties is  one delegation that
 the
days  been
reported 
""
Maybe you would like to 
""
""
""
""
And uh  come up to a little later as far as
the question of  total dependability of the official heirarchy of
officers to be impartial in all that they do  is regretably no longer
available 
""
Whether it is uh  officers at higher level officers at the
lower level or  work reciding in polling offices and polling
stations 
""
People who work as magistrates and others  people at higher
level 
""
I may say with all the humility I possess 
""
In all the humility I possess that the point of time at which 
one could say without asking any question that this report would be totally
impartial 
""
Any content mistakes of facts which are genuinely mistakes of fact
""
""
But which they are not those of  if I may use very bad word
committed people 
""
This I did mention to more than one political party 
""
But  that there are enough
checks and balances built-in  in order to ensure that somebody say so if
not adequate for taking an action 
""
This is as far as it concern
""
""
Now you raise the other question you countermanded  and
then you are hearing people
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Does this create the instability 
""
""
It certainly creates doubts in the minds of people whether
the election commission  is in two minds about its own decisions
""
As far as I am concerned  those five counteremanding decisions
were taken with a full sense of responsibility  after analyzing the status
and  hundreds and hundreds of reports which were received on the twentieth
""
""
""
There was official  they were none of the
official report
""
""
No  I I don't concede that
statement to you 
""
I don't concede the fore factual possession to you 
""
You may be referring to report from a certain set of offices like
""
""
Look here  chief election commissioners office in the
state
""
""
 again mentioning you
""
""
 the returning officer in the state
""
""
 mentioning it you
""
I have reports of the returning officers 
""
I have reports of the chief electoral officer
""
""
Recommending 
""
""
""
Look  sorry
""
I am not going into individual specifics 
""
I am mentioning again 
""
In coming to certain conclusions  we are not taking into
account  or failing to take into account any kinds of valid information
""
""
I will tell you we have returning officers reports 
""
We have chief electoral officers reports 
""
I have sent out three hundred central officers 
""
Now you might well ask what is this enormous waste of resources
and money to sent three hundred observers 
""
Now what was behind the sending of observer  somebody could
have asked this question 
""
Why do you have to sent central observers and state observers
""
""
They sent all the time
""
Last 
""
""
""
""
They were
""
""
Not three hundred but hundred 
""
""
 may I mention with all great
respect that last time around a total of seventy-five people were deployed
throughout the country 
""
This time I deployed three hundred not because I would like supply
to  deploy more
""
""
Therefore the election  even
after deploying three hundred
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
""
 let me tell you the elections were smooth in
Haryana 
""
They were smooth in Himachal they were smooth in Rajasthan 
they were smooth in Madhya Pradesh  they were smooth in Andhra Pradesh
except for minor cases here and there 
""
They were good in Andaman 
""
They were largely good in West Bengal 
""
Now you come to the core area of U P and Bihar 
""
We get into areas of greater and greater 
""
I won't use any other word 
""
We get into areas of greater and greater worry 
""
""
 why there is some charge that you are
listenning to a particular  political group
""
""
No no  look I have mentioned again and let me again submit
to you that if 
""
""
I am sorry the umpire will have to put with it
