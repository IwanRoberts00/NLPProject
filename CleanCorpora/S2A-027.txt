<I>
I prepared it just uh in case we need to refer to
something common which we have in our hand 
Uh and I'll keep the tone of this talk uh quite
informal 
So in case you want to sort of place some questions 
uhm it's better to postpone them till the end of the talk
But uh in case you feel that uh you have a very strong
impulse to ask something you can stop me you know and you know sort of
uh there is no problem 
Well I've termed this the the title of this as 
 Language in Poetry 
 It's very uh very often we talk of language of
poetry or the poetic language 
And uh I think there are two ways of looking at it 
One is the what we call the classical traditional 
approach to poetic language 
That there is a special specially marked group of
words which are highly poetic in nature the classical and the
neo- classical way of writing poems 
Uh this is exemplified in my first example the notion
of poetic diction 
Uh you must have heard of Banabhatt the seventh century
 Sanskrit writer the writer of the piece called
 Kadambari the first formal narrative uh
very elaborate narrative in Sanskrit in prose 
The supreme example of classical prose style cough
 in Sanskrit 
 It's also the supreme example of what an ornamental style
is like ornamental prose style 
And it is said what I want to illustrate uh to this is 
you see this work was incomplete there is a myth about uh this
work called Kadambari 
The work was incomplete when he was about to die 
He called to one of his shisyas and also
 his son was there 
Uh just to test who would who who would be able to
complete the work in case he is not able to complete and then 
And he you know he pointed to a withered tree and uh 
asked what is it ?
And I have given the two responses one of Bana's 
disciple who said shusko vrikshaha tishthati agre agre
 in front of us agre shuskai dried up
withered vriksha is tree tishathati 
is standing 
Now Bana asked his son what about you what is that ?
And he said neeras taruhu iha vilasati puratha
purataha is again uh uh that's almost the same as
 agre 
Okay but uh it is more poetic to say 
purataha than to say agre 
It highly prosaic to say agre vilasati 
 instead of tishathati uh you have heard of the
word vilas where you can you know vilasati
 in that sense taruhu instead of 
vrikshaha iha is uh neeras instead of
 shuska it is neeras 
So these are some of the dimension of a poetic 
diction 
Modern poets and modern critic uh particularly post nineteenth
century post symbolist don't believe in this approach at all 
In fact modern poetry has revolted against this kind of thing
in fact 
The the revolt began with in the West with the
nineteenth century romantic poets 
Wordsworth wanted to write the language of men okay
The the common commonly used language not the specially
used specially concocted poetical diction or poetic diction 
But what it it uh does perhaps this kind of an
approach is to draw your attention to draw our attention to the
element of choice involved in all poetry 
The element of choice in diction that is in vocabulary 
element of choice involved in structures their arrangements choice of
metre or non-metre everything is a matter of choice and it is a choice
 in language
And that is why I say It is language in poetry 
You have to uh uh poetry happens in language 
See again the traditional view that language is the dress
 is the ornament for content is the soul is quite misleading 
Even without taking the extreme organical stand that you know 
language and thought language and content are organically related
Even without going into that kind of an extreme position we can
still say that poetry is something which happens in language cough
 which emerges out of language you can't think of poetry without
thinking of language 
You can't say that poetry uh somehow exist somewhere outside
language 
This language which limits it as Wilkin Cine had said 
uh the limits of our language are the limits of our experience 
In that sense the limits of our language are the limits of uh
poetry which get written in that language in a sense 
But it is only uh metaphor I am using because those limits are
extendable those limits are in fact being uhm uh changed and shifted
 by the poets themselves okay
So this is uh my first point uh that it there is 
we need not think in terms of false dichotomies like language Vs
literature most students and teachers of literature are uh tend to
look at it in uh in that particular fashion
Language Vs literature I think it's a it's 
absolutely a false dichotomy this is it's a false opposition 
popularized by those who were uh well who who don't want to make the
necessary effort to you know uh uhm look at the language of
poetry carefully 
Uh so one of the most fascinating aspects of reading and
studying literature and poetry to explore its relation to language 
Now what I want to now look at is see in the
twentieth century the Swiss linguist Ferdinand Sassuare first
 gave us this particular notion that language is a system of
sign
The first semiotic motion okay which has shaken
the intellectual world which has shaped it in a new way many many
different disciplines including anthropology including sociology
including psychology structuralism and semiotics have played 
a crucial role in literature in language certainly 
Now what is it mean to say that language is a system of signs what
are the implications of this okay 
 It's a semiot to to give language as a semiotic system 
Uh let me tell you that Sassuare though he was the first
twentieth century linguist in the West to look at language in this
particular fashion language as a system bu and emphasis
the systemic systemic aspect of language 
Uh this approach in classical times uh goes back
to say Panini okay 
The whole theory of Sanskrit grammar which Panini developed
 has it has been called structuralist it has been called generative
Now apart from those terms I am not going to elaborate
those terms but certainly language and its structure have fascinated
people 
People have had a lot of theories about it 
We shall selectively use a part of that theory in order to
see how what happens to language in poetry 
Just as we see what happens how poetry happens in language
I want to see how what happens to language in poetry 
And this can be seen at four levels four basic levels of
linguistic structuring which linguists have identified 
Language for a linguist is essentially spoken 
So it is cough phonological as they call 
phonological
Phonology is the study of the systems of sounds 
Languages select certain sounds arbitraly and start
 organizing them in certain systematic way 
There are infinite number of sounds which a human vocal
organism can produce in itself as you can see from a child babling 
All kinds of sounds are produced 
But certain sounds are identified as functionally relevant sounds
 and are structured 
So this is called the phonological level of structuring 
linguistic structure 
These sounds come together to form certain level of higher
abstractions that is you can have a syllable and you can have
certain clusters of consonants certain clusters of vowels
So vowels consonants and higher levels of organizations
into syllables 
This is one level 
Further you develop into the level of word word which
is called morphology word and formation of words 
A still higher level of organization by higher I mean 
larger and larger units of organization is the syntactic level 
And through syntax you communicate meaning the meanings
are also structured in language
So Sassuare was trying to explore the nature of the linguistic
sign which on the one hand relates certain sounds to certain
words uh to certain meanings 
So sounds on the one hand meanings on the other what Sassuare
called a relation between the signifier and the signified the
sounds and images sounds and meanings etcetera
And these four levels of structuring what Sassuare developed
 and what modern linguistics has developed is a certain way of
describing the structure of a language 
Describing the norm which governs language behaviour ordinary
 linguistic behaviour ordinary speech behaviour 
What are the rules ?
Okay 
This is what lead us to 
Now obviously when you have a rule there is also a
possibility of breaking that rule of deviating from the rule 
And to begin with I would say that poetry is some kind of
a purposeful deviation from the norm of usage from the normal usage
you deviate purposefully 
Now I don't want to bring in problems of intentionality and so on
 on the poe on the part of the poet
I don't want to go into the poet's psychy to ask the
questions what did this poet actually mean when when he wrote this 
For me it is enough if we can reconstruct some kind of a poet
within the poem 
 That's enough for me I don't have to go and verify
from the poet did you mean really this or something else 
 That's not that's not my approach 
that's may be a relevant approach for a psycho-analyst for a
biographer but not for say a literary critic 
A literary critic would be interested in the text how text
 uh become in the texuality of the text okay 
How these text makes construct meaning with
the help of whatever norm if that is available with the help of one
word 
So that's why I put in norm and deviation 
 I'll come to examples a little later 
Let me go on to the third point in my synopsis 
Modern linguistics has not stop at the consideration of
 structure of language 
It has also to say something about the functions of language
 particularly uh the European school of analysis
See the after Sassuare Sassuare was a Swiss linguist 
writing in French around nineteen hundred and twelve he delivered
between nineteen nine and nineteen twelve he delivered a series of
lectures which have now come to the uh come to be recognized as
revolutionary lectures in the form of a course 
They were published as a book uh Sassuare never intended
to write it as a book but uh lecture notes were uh expanded and
published in the form of a book Course in General Linguistics
 by students and it has shaped our notions of language 
Uh though Sassuare didn't write anything about literature his
views of language have been same as very crucial in our dealing with 
poetic language 
One at the structural level the American linguist took
over took took off from that point and developed theories of
structure 
One whole school came into being called American structuralism lead
by Leonard Brumfield uh culminated in the work of Charles Hawkins
After that there was again a a reaction against that and
 uh from M I T Chomsky has been developing his theory of Generative
Grammar nineteen fifty-seven onwards 
So this has been the line of printing the generative grammar
the structuralist grammar in the field of description of linguistic
structure 
The other line was followed by the European linguists 
particularly linguists of the France school 
And there is one linguist who who has remained the link
between language literature European tradition American tradition and
has sort of you know uh has been able to combine the various uh
traditions in the western world and something which can be called a western
tradition of linguistics uh symbolized by Roman Jocobson the work of
Roman Jacobson 
Uh who was part of the Russian formalists part of the
France school part of the uh American scene after the sixties 
And the functions that I have enumerated uh have been
proposed by Jacobson very simply 
Again there is a specially poetic function which he
identified but these are not functions which are mutually exclusive 
every speech act for the linguists of France school for Roman
Jacobson has six different directions 
It can have these potentially it has the six different elements
and these six different directions 
They are sort of orientations of the speech act 
One is you can you can say I am very unhappy
 
This is self-expression 
The speaker is attracting attention to himself or herself and
trying to tell people what is happening to him or her 
This is called the expressive function of language
Please notice that unlike the romantic or the expressive
theories in the West Jacobson does not equate this kind of
self-expression with the poetic language 
Language of poetry is not language of self- expression 
Second you can orient it to the receiver of your message 
in a poetic act you can say please open the door 
I am not expressing my feelings about it I am simply 
persuading you requesting you trying to influence you to do something 
This can be called connotive or uh emotive persuasive 
use of language 
This is an orientation and please notice that poetry can
be expressive but that is not its central function
Poetry can be emotive persuasive for example take
patriotic poetry can be vey highly emotive and persuasive but that's
 not its function according to Jacobson 
The third is I can straight refer to the environment because there
is a context to our entire uh speech act 
And I can say well uh It's rather hot today
 which serves to refer to an internal or external factor
in the communicative act
This can be called a referential function of language
 I'll describe it 
Referring to something specific in the environment in the
context of the speech act this is called the uh referential
function or the des descriptive function
of language 
This also is part of literary language part of poetic language
descriptive poetry 
For example in novels you get a lot of descriptions you can
 you have evocative language you have you have expressive
language and so on okay
