<I>
""
""
I prepared it just  refer to
something 
""
Uh  tone of this talk uh quite
informal 
""
So 
uhm  better to postpone them till the end of the talk
""
But uh  you have a very strong
impulse to ask something you can stop me you know  and you know sort of
uh 
""
Well 
""
""
 very often we talk of language of
poetry 
""
And uh 
""
One is the 
approach to 
""
That there is a  group of
words  the classical and the
neo- classical 
""
Uh  the notion
of poetic diction 
""
Uh you must have heard of  the seventh century
 called
 uh
very elaborate narrative in Sanskrit 
""
The  cough
""
""
 also the supreme example of what an ornamental style
is like 
""
And it is said 
you see  this
work called 
""
The work was incomplete when he was 
""
He called to one of his  and also
""
""
Uh just to test  who would be able to
complete the work in case he is not able to complete 
""
And he you know 
asked  ?
""
And I have 
disciple  agre
 dried up
withered 
is standing 
""
Now  ?
""
And he said  taruhu iha vilasati puratha
purataha  almost the same as
""
""
Okay 
purataha 
""
It 
 uh you have heard of the
word  vilasati
""
vrikshaha  instead of
""
""
So these are some of the 
diction 
""
Modern poets and modern critic  uh particularly post nineteenth
century post symbolist 
""
In fact modern poetry has revolted against  this kind of thing
in fact 
""
The the revolt began  in the West with the
nineteenth century romantic poets 
""
Wordsworth  okay
""
""
The  the specially
used 
""
But  perhaps this kind of an
approach is to draw your attention to  the
element of choice involved in all 
""
The element of choice in diction 
element of choice involved in structures  choice of
metre or non-metre everything is a matter of choice  and it is a choice
 in language
""
And that is why I say 
""
You have to 
""
See again the traditional view that  dress
""
""
Even without taking the extreme organical stand that you know 
language and thought language and content are  organically related
""
Even without going into  that kind of an extreme position we can
still say that poetry is something which happens  cough
 without
thinking of language 
""
You can't say that poetry  uh somehow exist somewhere outside
language 
""
This language which limits it as 
uh the limits of 
""
In that sense the limits of our language are the limits of  uh
poetry which get written in that language 
""
But it is only uh metaphor I am using because  those limits are
extendable those limits are  uhm uh changed and shifted
 okay
""
So this is 
we need not think in terms of false dichotomies  Vs
literature most students and  uh tend to
look at it in uh  in that particular fashion
""
Language Vs literature I think 
absolutely a false dichotomy this is 
popularized by those who were  uh well who who don't want to make the
necessary effort to you know  the language of
poetry 
""
Uh  fascinating aspects of reading and
studying 
""
Now  in the
twentieth century  first
 that language is a system of
sign
""
The first  which has shaken
the intellectual world  which has shaped it in a new way many many
different disciplines  sociology
including 
a crucial role 
""
Now what is it mean to say that language is a system of signs what
are the implications of this 
""
""
""
Uh let me tell you that  though he was the first
twentieth century linguist  in the West to look at language in this
particular fashion  and emphasis
the systemic 
""
Uh  goes back
to say 
""
The whole theory of Sanskrit grammar  which Panini developed
 it has been called structuralist it has been called generative
""
Now  going to elaborate
those terms but certainly language and its structure  have fascinated
people 
""
People have 
""
We shall selectively use  in order to
see how 
""
Just as we see  how poetry happens in language
""
""
I want to see 
""
And this can be seen at  four basic levels of
linguistic structuring 
""
Language 
""
So 
phonological
""
Phonology is the study of 
""
Languages  and start
""
""
There are infinite number of sounds which a human  vocal
organism can produce 
""
All kinds of sounds 
""
But certain sounds are identified as functionally relevant sounds
""
""
So this is called the phonological level of structuring 
linguistic structure 
""
These sounds come together to form certain level  higher
abstractions that is  and you can have
certain clusters of consonants certain clusters of vowels
""
So vowels  higher levels of organizations
into syllables 
""
This is 
""
Further  word word which
is called morphology 
""
A still higher level 
larger and larger units 
""
And  communicate meaning the meanings
are also  structured in language
""
So Sassuare was trying to  explore the nature of the linguistic
sign  to certain
words 
""
So sounds on the one hand  meanings on the other what Sassuare
called  the
sounds and images  etcetera
""
And these four levels of structuring  what Sassuare developed
 a certain way of
describing 
""
Describing the norm which governs language behaviour  ordinary
""
""
What are the rules  ?
""
Okay 
""
This is 
""
Now obviously when you have a rule  a
possibility of breaking that rule 
""
And  is some kind of
a purposeful deviation from the norm of usage  usage
you deviate 
""
Now I don't want to bring in problems of intentionality and so on
 on the part of the poet
""
I don't want to go into the  psychy to ask the
questions 
""
For me it is enough if we can  reconstruct some kind of a poet
within the poem 
""
 go and verify
from the poet did you mean really this 
""
""
that's  for a
biographer 
""
A literary critic would be interested in  how text
""
""
How these text  with
the help of whatever norm  one
word 
""
So 
""
""
""
Let me go on to the third point in my 
""
Modern linguistics has not stop at the  of
""
""
It has also to say something about  the functions of language
 analysis
""
See the 
writing in French  he delivered
between nineteen nine  he delivered a series of
lectures which have  come to be recognized as
revolutionary lectures in the form of a course 
""
They were published as  uh Sassuare never intended
to write it as a book but  uh expanded and
published in the form of a book  Course in General Linguistics
""
""
Uh though Sassuare didn't write anything about literature  his
views of language have been 
poetic language 
""
One  took
over  took off from that point and developed theories of
structure 
""
One whole school came into being called American structuralism lead
by Leonard Brumfield  Charles Hawkins
""
""
After that  a a reaction against that and
 uh from M I T Chomsky has been developing his theory of Generative
Grammar 
""
So this has been the line of printing  the generative grammar
the structuralist grammar  description of linguistic
structure 
""
The other line was followed by the European linguists 
particularly 
""
And there is one linguist who  who has remained the link
between language  European tradition American tradition and
has sort of you know  uh
traditions in the western world and something which can be called a western
tradition of linguistics  the work of
Roman Jacobson 
""
Uh  part of the
France school 
""
And  uh have been
proposed by Jacobson 
""
Again there is  a specially poetic function which he
identified but 
every speech act  Roman
Jacobson 
""
It can have these potentially it has the six different elements
and these 
""
They are sort of orientations of the speech act 
""
One is  I am very unhappy
""
""
This is 
""
The speaker is attracting attention to himself or herself  and
trying to tell people 
""
This is called the expressive function of language
""
Please notice  the romantic or the expressive
theories in the West Jacobson does not equate  this kind of
self-expression with the poetic 
""
Language of poetry is not language of self- expression 
""
Second 
in a poetic act 
""
I am not expressing 
persuading you requesting you 
""
This can be called connotive 
use of language 
""
This is an orientation and please notice that  can
be expressive  but that is not its central function
""
Poetry can be emotive  for example take
patriotic poetry can be vey  that's
""
""
The third is I can straight refer to the environment because there
is a context to our 
""
And I can say well uh  rather hot today
 to refer to an internal or external factor
in the communicative act
""
This can be called a referential function of language
""
""
""
Referring to something specific  in the environment in the
context of the speech act  uh referential
function or the  function
of language 
""
This also is part of literary language part of poetic language
descriptive poetry 
""
For example in novels you get a lot of descriptions  you can
 expressive
language and so on
