<I>
""
""
So when did you come  ?
""
""
I came today morning at seven 
""
And I reached here  Express
from Delhi
""
First from Amritsar I took 
and from there I have to take another train which is this  Dakshin
""
""
And I don't know how 
laughs 
""
""
There is more than the first class 
""
""
""
""
""
It was a pleasant experience but also very tiring
""
This train is 
""
And there is a faster train  Andhra Express which takes just
twenty-four hours 
""
But the timing doesn't suit
""
""
Uhm how things are moving in Punjab now-a-days  ?
""
""
Punjab is much better now 
""
And 
eighty percent of the problem is solved 
""
It is really solved because 
""
""
But twenty percent problem is there 
""
""
Twenty percent means that you don't feel it
""
You see 
""
So you can say  some extortionist some terrorist whatever may be
there 
""
But for  I mean when the life was
disturbed  that thing was not there
""
""
What do you think about this Ayodhya problem now  ?
""
""
I think  whatever has happened
""
""
And 
 also think
""
The silent majority thinks 
""
I mean this is exactly what happened in Punjab you know  when
""
""
""
""
uh something wrong
""
""
Yeah will they be in favour of BJP  ?
""
""
No they think 
""
Because 
""
Uh they started listening to people who were not within the party
 uh modern things that worsened the terrorists
or whatever
""
So now  has taken orders from uh
 uhm
yes
""
So they don't face the same problem  what I feel that it could
turn out to be that way 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh so it may  turn out like a boomrang
""
""
Yes  because you see
 majority of the people they are
aware of all this now 
""
Even the  they want to live
in peace 
""
And all this disturbs peace 
""
""
Some 
and because of  be benefitted
""
""
""
""
These are all political stunts I think 
""
""
Oh well are you happy here  Satyam ?
""
""
""
fine 
""
And 
laughter 
""
And uh I think it should be fine and  I had long desired to come
here because  English
""
""
""
""
""
""
You you don't have mosquitoes there in your home  ?
""
""
No  we have mosquitoes there
""
But 
""
""
I mean that what you told 
""
""
Uh you see the mosquitoes are there  mosquito curtains are
not there and uh 
""
""
No you see we  it's
 very cold
there now 
""
So when 
severe  die
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm so they are only some 
""
""
So you are free from mosquitoes 
""
""
Not throughout the year  and here you
see the mosquitoes are well bred  uhm yes so there they
die  come up
""
""
And then they attack 
""
""
But 
""
I mean in uh  uh during the mosquito season in
like Amritsar and many cities  say
some good colonies 
""
So if the muncipality of Hyderabad
""
""
So what would be the reason then  ?
""
""
I think  the
mosquitoes
""
We won't have them in the campus
""
""
Simple reason is  if you want to control you can control if
you don't  and
""
""
So 
""
laughs 
""
""
""
""
""
So after 
uhm  you want
to do  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See actually I came here  of course
""
""
For refresher course  all right
""
""
To get refreshed 
""
""
And uh a friend of mine says  Hyderabad is
famous for pearls 
""
He has given me some money to buy some 
""
So  up to look out for somebody who knows what pearls
are because I don't know what they are 
""
""
And there are a lot of uh artificial uh sellers 
""
So I will have to buy some pearls for a friend of mine  and uh
 a museum they say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh Salarjung
""
""
And uh a fort 
""
""
""
""
And I also told Dr Prakasham  to arrange something for atleast
people from outside
""
""
Yes
""
""
I mean  you are an outsider
""
""
Yes yes 
""
Though of course you must have seen everything because you have
been staying here 
""
But still there are many 
or a few of them so
""
""
They have made the programme very tight 
""
""
""
""
""
And they treat us as 
""
""
""
They they can have the same number of sessions same number of
speakers  one and
half hours  and with teacher there also he just
keeps
""
""
Would you would you like to come out with 
when we find something is  above
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Then people accept it as it is 
""
And 
""
""
Uh yes
""
""
They don't want
""
""
They say the UGC says so many working hours
""
""
Uhm sometimes the UGC says  uh what goes
in political circle
""
""
So I think what ever you think in academic also 
""
""
I think what they should do is  they should make it from
""
""
One hour is added there 
""
Cut off Saturday  and adding one hour means missing one hour
 you will
naturally cut it short
""
""
No in Maharashtra what they say 
adeshraj  when something comes from
above  whether it is rational or irrational
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm see 
""
""
No that 
""
""
 little
""
""
I requested them why not to  turn some of the sessions
into library sessions
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And then all of us could have got benefitted
""
""
What is this project  ?
""
""
You can have any project  of your choice
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
If  project means we can you have to say have particular
topic
""
You have to work on that topic  and this is the way the thing
could be done dealt 
""
This is what you have to 
""
""
""
""
""
You know synopsis of the project
""
""
What is it ?
""
""
No they don't give
""
""
""
""
""
They don't give you have to have a  data
""
""
Uhm
""
""
For uh  yes if you have a problem
""
""
Uhm uhm and then you work on that
""
""
Then you work on that either in the library or  field or
whatever  it maybe
""
""
So  just like writing of the paper
""
""
 all
""
""
""
""
Suppose I want to  ?
""
""
Oh yes 
""
Why two ?
""
""
One one one yes that is  but thay are
also saying that you have to present a paper at the end
""
""
That is the same work 
""
When you work on a particular  say a
""
""
 they were talking about two
different things  on
something  and then several others
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Definitely 
""
""
 compulsory for all ?
""
""
No that ten minutes business is compulsory
""
""
""
""
""
So that again a paper and project is again a paper 
""
""
No both in all you have
""
""
Faster than  that will be for every
body
""
""
That is for everybody right 
""
And the project  you have to
present that also
""
""
You have half an hour choice
""
""
Half an hour
""
""
And then discussion
""
""
Discussion is also going to be about cross question and all
what we have so  I think the four speaker is going to be just this
""
""
That is a just 
""
""
Uh first ten minutes talk 
by the participants 
""
""
See for pretty long time that practice teaching  sessions
are there 
""
And still we find they are not ready to come out of that 
""
So here also 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And as we find  we are
there 
""
""
It is uh it is going to be you you are going to have B Ed
teaching
""
""
No, not I 
""
Actually see  one months time is it possible for you
to present a really something that can be called the research paper  ?
""
""
Yeah on that project  way
research take here 
""
""
See  get some grant from UGC or something
like that then you have to present something 
""
""
Uhm Uhm
""
""
In one form or the other 
""
""
No but I don't think  uh this must be the case in other
refresher courses
""
""
Might not be
""
""
This is a kind of thing
""
""
In other refresher courses what atmosphere you find 
atleast you find here  there are no
afternoon sessions 
""
I did my first at Pune  no refresher
 so no afternoon sessions nothing like that
""
""
 done one
""
""
Only from nine to 
""
""
Now they were I think about five  uh different refresher
courses now  this
""
""
Yes one is uh one is at Jaipur  uh at yes
""
""
Vishakapatnam
""
""
No no Trivandrum Shimla 
""
My catchment area was Simla 
""
Uh but I didn't want to go there  from cold Amritsar to
colder Simla say 
""
The freezing point 
""
So I wanted to come to number  number one of course Hyderabad
 be nice here
""
""
In my case what happened  we were at the Ulakh Vidyanagar
""
""
And Shriraman is the  co-ordinator
here 
""
So why not uh why don't you come to  Hyderabad
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay  alright
""
""
""
laughter 
""
""
And  hundred and five
applicants
""
""
Yes  what
""
""
You were of course very fortunate very fortunate  laughter
""
""
But what  what must be the criterion for this ?
""
""
One criterion he has mentioned 
""
""
That is the one
""
""
 right
""
""
That is the one  right
""
""
So one he has mentioned
""
""
No but what I must be find  the other
things are there  I'm
 on there correspondence department
""
""
Oh you think you are
""
""
Only 
that's 
""
""
That way I was lucky to know Dr Prakashan also  laughter
 uh what you said
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He is a very practical man
""
 ah
""
""
He was there in the department called Anthropological linguistic
""
""
That department was started by this  professor called professor
Ranjit Gill 
""
He is in JNU in  uh
department of English
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Technologist I think  school of language
""
""
School of language
""
""
He is a professor there 
""
He had started all that department 
""
And Dr Kasiwal was also there 
""
And he taught us  and I know him
since then 
""
And  very
""
""
""
""
""
But uh
""
""
So what what is  no what is applicable to me
""
""
""
