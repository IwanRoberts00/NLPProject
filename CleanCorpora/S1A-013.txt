So when did you come  ?
""
""
I came today morning at seven 
""
And I reached here  Express
""
""
First from Amritsar I took 
""
""
""
""
laughs 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And there is a faster train  Andhra Express which takes just
""
""
But the timing doesn't suit
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And 
""
""
It is really solved because 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
there 
""
But for  I mean when the life was
disturbed  that thing was not there
""
""
What do you think about this Ayodhya problem now  ?
""
""
I think  whatever has happened
""
""
""
""
""
The silent majority thinks 
""
I mean this is exactly what happened in Punjab you know  when
""
""
""
""
uh something wrong
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh they started listening to people who were not within the party
""
""
""
So now  has taken orders from uh
""
yes
""
""
turn out to be that way 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
aware of all this now 
""
""
in peace 
""
And all this disturbs peace 
""
""
Some 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh I think it should be fine and  I had long desired to come
""
""

You you don't have mosquitoes there in your home  ?

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then they attack 
""
""
""
""
I mean in uh  uh during the mosquito season in
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

So  up to look out for somebody who knows what pearls
