<I>
So when did you come ?
I came today morning at seven O'clock 
And I reached here I came by Dakshin Express
from Delhi
First from Amritsar I took a train and I came by AC fare 
and from there I have to take another train which is this Dakshin
 Express and uh I took second AC there 
And I don't know how they're going to pay me now 
laughs 
There is more than the first class laughs 
 It's a pleasant experience 
It was a pleasant experience but also very tiring
This train is uh it takes thirty-six hours 
And there is a faster train Andhra Express which takes just
twenty-four hours 
But the timing doesn't suit
Uhm how things are moving in Punjab now-a-days ?
Punjab is much better now 
And as you must have read in the papers as they say 
eighty percent of the problem is solved 
It is really solved because one can lead a normal life now 
But twenty percent problem is there 
Twenty percent means that you don't feel it
You see I mean crime is always there 
So you can say some extortionist some terrorist whatever may be
there 
But for uh for practical purposes I mean when the life was
disturbed that thing was not there
What do you think about this Ayodhya problem now ?
I think it's a bad thing whatever has happened
And uh I think the educated Hindu people 
 they they also think
The silent majority thinks that it's a wrong thing 
I mean this is exactly what happened in Punjab you know when
 the Akalis 
 Do Punjabi's think is it's 
uh something wrong
Yeah will they be in favour of BJP ?
No they think it's wrong 
Because a similar thing happened with the Akalis 
Uh they started listening to people who were not within the party
 like that Bindrawala or uh modern things that worsened the terrorists
or whatever
So now BGP BJP has taken orders from uh
 sadhus and sanyasis uhm
yes
So they don't face the same problem what I feel that it could
turn out to be that way 
 Sadhus and sanyasis 
Oh so it may turn out like a boomrang
Yes it I think it will be like that because you see
 uh people majority as I said majority of the people they are
aware of all this now 
Even the uneducated people many of them they want to live
in peace 
And all this disturbs peace 
Some people feel that there is a kind of new awareness 
and because of that BJP is likely to be benefitted
 There's no awareness 
These are all political stunts I think 
Oh well are you happy here Satyam ?
 It's too early to say that but so far it's 
fine 
And uh I've to be careful of the mosquitoes here 
laughter 
And uh I think it should be fine and I had long desired to come
here because uh it is the what you say Mecca for uh English
 English 
You you don't have mosquitoes there in your home ?
No we have mosquitoes there
But mosquitoes of CIEFL are famous laughter 
I mean that what you told 
Uh you see the mosquitoes are there mosquito curtains are
not there and uh 
No you see we in Amritsar there's it's
 an extreme weather ah ha I mean it's very cold
there now and it will be hotter than what is here now 
So when it's severe cold mosquitoes will die out and 
severe wint uh summers they'll again die
 Ah ha 
 Mosquitoes are there 
Uhm so they are only some laughter 
So you are free from mosquitoes 
Not throughout the year but of course and here you
see the mosquitoes are well bred laughs uhm yes so there they
die and then again they have to come up
And then they attack 
But I don't know why they can't control it 
I mean in uh when I'm uh during the mosquito season in
like Amritsar and many cities especially in uh let's say
some good colonies the municipalities they spray 
So if the muncipality of Hyderabad
So what would be the reason then ?
I think uh there should be a spray in the campus the
mosquitoes
We won't have them in the campus
Simple reason is if you want to control you can control if
you don't laughter and
So if CIEFL is doing such good work in languages 
 ah it should do this little work of killing mosquitoes also 
laughs 
 Ah 
So after uh hearing so much about uh CIEFL 
uhm and coming over here uhm uh what exactly you want
to do ?
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
See actually I came here of course
For refresher course that's all right
To get refreshed laughter 
And uh a friend of mine says uh the Hyderabad is
famous for pearls 
He has given me some money to buy some 
So I've up to look out for somebody who knows what pearls
are because I don't know what they are haan 
And there are a lot of uh artificial uh sellers uhm 
So I will have to buy some pearls for a friend of mine and uh
 I will visit uh there's a museum they say
 Haan 
 Uhm 
Uh Salarjung
And uh a fort 
 That's why I wanted five days a week 
And I also told Dr Prakasham to arrange something for atleast
people from outside
Yes
I mean you're you are an outsider
Yes yes 
Though of course you must have seen everything because you have
been staying here 
But still there are many could be many people who haven't 
or a few of them so
They have made the programme very tight 
 It's very correct 
And they treat us as uh school children laughter 
 because they don't allow or they dont give any time to 
They they can have the same number of sessions same number of
speakers and uh with uh one lecture say if it's one and
half hours make it one hour and with teacher there also he just
keeps
Would you would you like to come out with uh your idea 
when we find something is impo imposed from above
Uhm uhm
Then people accept it as it is 
And 
Uh yes
They don't want
They say the UGC says so many working hours
Uhm sometimes the UGC says and we find uh what goes
in political circle
So I think what ever you think in academic also 
I think what they should do is they should make it from
 let's say five-thirty to six-thirty everyday 
One hour is added there 
Cut off Saturday and adding one hour means missing one hour
 because laughter ) when the programme is too long you will
naturally cut it short
No in Maharashtra what they say that there is 
adeshraj uhm and as when something comes from
above it could not be challenged whether it is rational or irrational
 accept it and act upon it 
 Uhm 
Uhm see that's on paper you see 
No that laughter so 
 so little
I requested them why not to turn some of the sessions
into library sessions
Yeah
And then all of us could have got benefitted
What is this project that they are talking about ?
You can have any project ah of your choice
 Ah 
Uhm
If project means we can you have to say have particular
topic
You have to work on that topic and this is the way the thing
could be done dealt 
This is what you have to 
 Achha so you just uh 
You know synopsis of the project
What is it ?
No they don't give
 Haan 
They don't give you have to have a data
Uhm
For uh yes if you have a problem
Uhm uhm and then you work on that
Then you work on that either in the library or field or
whatever it maybe
So it's just like writing of the paper
 That's all
 That's all 
Suppose I want to work on two novels will it do ?
Oh yes 
Why two ?
One one one yes that is nei but thay are
also saying that you have to present a paper at the end
That is the same work 
When you work on a particular say a
 Nei nei they were talking about two
different things that everybody has to speak for about ten minutes on
something and then several others
 Nei once you have a project 
Uhn
Definitely you've to present a paper 
 Nei but that's compulsory for all ?
No that ten minutes business is compulsory
 It's that is compulsory 
So that again a paper and project is again a paper 
No both in all you have
Faster than One or two words that will be for every
body
That is for everybody right 
And the project the problem that you work on you have to
present that also
You have half an hour choice
Half an hour
And then discussion
Discussion is also going to be about cross question and all
what we have so I think the four speaker is going to be just this
That is a just 
Uh first ten minutes talk and then half an hour talks 
by the participants 
See for pretty long time that practice teaching sessions
are there 
And still we find they are not ready to come out of that 
So here also it's a kind of practice teaching 
Yeah 
And as we find these things are not there we are
there laughter 
It is uh it is going to be you you are going to have B Ed
teaching
No, not I but see paper reading comes to that 
Actually see in uh one months time is it possible for you
to present a really something that can be called the research paper ?
Yeah on that project that's that's way
research take here that's right 
See when you get some grant from UGC or something
like that then you have to present something 
Uhm Uhm
In one form or the other 
No but I don't think uh this must be the case in other
refresher courses
Might not be
This is a kind of thing
In other refresher courses what atmosphere you find 
atleast you find here after noon sessions are there there are no
afternoon sessions 
I did my first at Pune and what atmosphere no refresher
 so no afternoon sessions nothing like that
 Achha you've done one
Only from nine to one and then completely free 
Now they were I think about five uh different refresher
courses now this
Yes one is uh one is at Jaipur uh Pune uh at yes
Vishakapatnam
No no Trivandrum Shimla 
My catchment area was Simla 
Uh but I didn't want to go there and from cold Amritsar to
colder Simla say laughter 
The freezing point 
So I wanted to come to number number one of course Hyderabad
 uh and I wanted to come and also that it'll be nice here
In my case what happened we were at the Ulakh Vidyanagar
 Shriraman and myself uhm uhm 
And Shriraman is the co-ordinator co-ordinator
here 
So why not uh why don't you come to Hyderabad
 Uhm uhm 
 Co-ordinator 
Okay it's alright
 That's how I'm in Hyderabad 
laughter 
And we've only six from out of hundred and five
applicants
Yes that's what
You were of course very fortunate very fortunate laughter
But what what must be the criterion for this ?
One criterion he has mentioned laughter 
That is the one
 That's right
That is the one that's right
So one he has mentioned
No but what I must be find even for that the other
things are there I brought my English from one word now I'm
 on there correspondence department
Oh you think you are
Only not because uh he knows me and I know him 
that's not the thing 
That way I was lucky to know Dr Prakashan also laughter
 you know how it is particularly what I like uh what you said
 A few words in Sanskrit 
 He's a very laughter 
He is a very practical man
 He's uh I did my M Phil from Patiala ah
He was there in the department called Anthropological linguistic
 oh 
That department was started by this professor called professor
Ranjit Gill 
He is in JNU in what is that department of uh uh
department of English
 Ah 
 Oh 
Technologist I think school of language
School of language
He is a professor there uhm 
He had started all that department 
And Dr Kasiwal was also there 
And he taught us phoenetics that time and I know him
since then 
And very
 Uhn 
But uh
So what what is appli no what is applicable to me
 the same thing is applicable to him also laughter 
Hey you Prakash laughter
