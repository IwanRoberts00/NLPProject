Hello my name is 
""
""
Hello 
""
And we are having a discussion on todays children 
""
So sir what you feel about uh  todays children how they are in
Maths  ?
""
""
Uh childrens are okay 
""
""
Coach means they should be coached from  when they are in
nursery U K G itself 
""
The basic  means they
should be taught 
""
They should be introduced to the numbers 
""
So that  uh good in Maths
when they 
""
""
Uh then it became this 
""
So then it became nice only otherwise  didn't
follow 
""
""
No means uh  they
should be taught the basics of Maths
""
Now I teach in  sixth seventh standard
maths 
""
The children are not quite good in Maths 
""
But why they are not quite good  ?
""
What do you think  something else should be done
""
""
""
Uh suddenly it will be 
""
So 
""
And even home 
""
If they be in always that this is 
""
""
""
No means they don't know
""
""
No here I will not  uh that think that students are very
weak 
""
Actually they are good only 
""
Uh if suppose sometimes if they will not  get good
""
""
""
I see what actually I feel
""
""
All the types only 
""
""
But even the bases  write in numbers
 standard
even  they don't
know even the basics 
""
""
""
""
""
So  some students
having different different I Q 
""
So some some of them if you told one time 
uh understand quick and some of them 
""
""
For three years sir they are going in the same programme 
say from first second third fourth 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And till four years  take any
normal child  and
ten thousands and 
""
Atleast  that is why
 do the eighth
ninth and tenth standard sums 
""
Addition subtractions are the basics 
""
So what do you think about that  ?
""
What else efforts should be done  ?
""
No  asking you because
""
""
Uhn that means here  actually they must do more practice
""
""
By doing more  so
they  to improve
""
""
""
""
""
For example take seventh standard 
""
 but I take each and every sum
on the board
""
I make the students do the sum on the board  I
finished my portion 
""
I take revision 
""
So you being a higher  asking you
 guidence on how should I
prepare the students for Maths  ?
""
Because  taking fifth sixth seventh for the first time
Maths  guidence so that
""
""
I teach my best  each and every sum on the
board I make them solve on the board I take tests also I take revision also
""
""
What else should I do  ?
""
One week I go on with only four to five lessons I have done 
""
So what guidence 
""
""
 we can improve
otherwise only that one time it is not possible 
""
""
Means what else should I take  ?
""
""
""
I have to take make them  competitions
between the girls and the boys also
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah so 
""
So you can take out there again 
""
All type of students  uh
extraordinary 
""
The extraordinary they are going to 
""
And uh 
""
And you join with that one that uh  brilliant one that medium
 and so they are going to that means one by one they are going to discuss
""
""
And suddenly they are going to improve 
""
And we must do  uh like before that you told that regarding
competition 
""
""
""
""
""
No because I take competition between girls and the boys
""
I make one boy solve if he doesn't no I make one girl solve 
""
Let the competition spirit be between the both
""
But even though in for having such a lot of efforts on them 
still  might be my paper was hard
""
""
""
Ah now 
""
""
And I don't trust in giving the paper sums for revision 
""
""
Papers we can't say hard only  because they already taught
that same 
""
""
No same matter I have taught only just I have  I jumbled up
the numbers here and there 
""
All the sums were there in the text book itself  but still they
have not done 
""
Now what else guidence should I 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In that case you must improve their 
""
Writing and 
""
""
 they do the same exercise in classwork
they do the same exercise at homework 
""
They do it on the board also 
""
Means what do you think that the basic itself is not  good or
""
""
""
No by doing these all  test
and uh that  this way they are going to improve and we can't say within
that one month either 
""
""
 now two to three months have
become the school has started we finished our first unit test also 
""
""
No afterwards that they are  going to improve
suddenly 
""
""
Our fifth standard also is giving problem 
""
Do you know even they write 
""
""
Not even that fifth standard  even
higher classes also the same problem 
""
Even if 
and if once  soon
they are going to understand 
""
When after that 
 because that means uh
""
""
""
""
""
Then
""
""
Uh repetition is not there
""
When we left  it
is 
""
""
But how come we will be every time doing the same thing 
""
We have to complete our portion within time  ?
""
And again hammering the same and same and same sums we should
complete our portion also
""
We should have 
""
How is it possible sir  ?
""
""
So in only one week 
on that all exercise 
""
""
Sir we are having only half an hour period sir how come its
 having
seven period of maths  ?
""
""
Uhn
""
""
And in seven period atleast we should complete two to three
excercises 
""
One exercise  teaching and doing the excercises and their
homework and their classwork 
""
And completing this much is impossible sir
""
Everytime to do one exercise one sum  of
each exercise 
""
""
Even it is not possible by even  in school also
""
But in home parents 
""
""
That is the main thing  that
would again the main thing that they don't take at all  interest in the
""
""
If both husband and wife are working husband should do 
""
""
No both not only husband
""
""
He should help 
""
He should help 
""
""
 they must
do both 
""
And it is not possible  one side only
""
""
Either husband or  who is getting that
""
""
But no sir when
""
""
Time
""
""
When both of them reach home okay  the first thing is the
wife should get up and make tea for her husband why  ?
""
""
""
""
 not rule
""
""
No no no
""
""
No
""
""
""
""
Never a husband says that  make a cup of tea
okay you sit  never he says everytime
a wife should get up and make 
""
Both works same hours  isn't it ?
""
Both of them are uh earning  both of them are
earning for the same house
""
""
""
""
""
Okay it depend upon that even that wife also 
""
If she did no smoothly one time two time he is going to observe
 I'm
 if she started like that only
saying then he will never do 
""
Husband no  prepare it
""
If she 
prepare he is going to say that 
""
It depend upon their that uh 
""
""
But I don't think that any husband is  willingly
saying that  okay you sit for
a while 
""
Indian husbands don't  so
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh not Indian husband that  one
word 
""
""
No no 
""
It also depends upon the atmosphere in which they live 
because when  husbands don't see their fathers working they also don't
work in the house 
""
My husband doesn't work at all 
""
He never prepares a cup of tea he never does anything 
""
Sir sir you prepare tea  ?
""
""
Oh yes yes  I prepared as
""
""
So your wife is quite lucky  having you as
a husband sir 
""
""
No that uh here was that  uhm understand between both the
""
""
And even she is helping that all at my 
""
""
In what  ?
""
""
Uh that uh in home even  she is also
engaged in that uh  this way
""
""
""
 even now
 the
boys  doesn't work at all
""
And then he gets married 
""
And that time the in-laws start blaming that ahn when you get
married you start working this and that and he stops 
""
Like that is also they do 
""
""
It may 
""
""
No but why do the  ?
""
""
They never change 
""
""
They change sir how come you say like that 
""
When everytime  no it is not possible for your
husband okay  to do the work
""
He is also tired we are also tired isn't it  ?
""
So for this we say sometime 
""
I don't think that  yes come on
""
""
Some once in a while  once in a blue moon they help they say
that  but regularly a woman
have to work  isn't it ?
""
""
Actually that is Indian concept what you say that  uh uh
that  that
""
""
Okay okay 
 isn't it ?
""
She should cook she should look after the children 
alright 
""
But even if they women  working
as much as a man  as a
man itself 
""
Then why should he not work at home  ?
""
Isn't it the ego of the  trying
to 
""
""
""
""
""
 working both the
side  getting the same equivalent to him
""
""
And there is no difference between a husband and wife because that
""
""
""
But they don't think  Indian society never
thinks that man and woman are equal 
""
Ninety-nine percent of them say that women even if she works for
the whole day  laughs
""
""
""
But don't you think that they are uh 
""
This is changing
""
""
That only  only sir
 or the in-laws
say that 
""
""
See for example  I mean
I do a lot of cooking  all
""
""
But then now that  <{3
 I feel it is difficult to do
""
See I do my  uh I do my
work 
""
And when I feel very tired I may even sleep 
""
So now 
""
But then you know when I was young  uh I
mean my wife she does not work 
""
She has not work 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
