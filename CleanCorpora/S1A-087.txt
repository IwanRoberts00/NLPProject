<I>
Hello my name is uh Biradar 
Hello I'm Mrs Mamta Raybage 
And we are having a discussion on todays children and Maths 
So sir what you feel about uh todays children how they are in
Maths ?
Uh childrens are okay depends upon there coach 
Coach means they should be coached from when they are in
nursery U K G itself 
The basic of maths should be taught to them means they
should be taught in a funful way about the numbers 
They should be introduced to the numbers 
So that they'll make make might be uh good in Maths
when they go in the higher classes 
Uh then it became this uh good 
So then it became nice only otherwise they'll didn't
follow what is Maths 
No means uh I wanted to say that uh they
should be taught the basics of Maths
Now I teach in fourth fifth and sixth seventh standard
maths 
The children are not quite good in Maths 
But why they are not quite good ?
What do you think what more something else should be done
 so that there Maths will become perfect 
Uh suddenly it will be become perfect only 
So it depend upon that uh their environment 
And even home did condition also 
If they be in always that this is one word there are 
 not improve no improvement only 
No means they don't know
No here I will not uh that think that students are very
weak 
Actually they are good only 
Uh if suppose sometimes if they will not ge get good
 uhm diagrams or 
I see what actually I feel
All the types only 
But even the bases uhm for example write in numbers
 write in figures which they are taught from first standard
even uhm still they reach the fifth standard they don't
know even the basics 
 Uhm 
So what we call to it here uh I Q some students
having different different I Q 
So some some of them if you told one time they are going to 
uh understand quick and some of them 
For three years sir they are going in the same programme 
say from first second third fourth 
Ah 
And till four years a child normal child take any
normal child if he doesn't know the difference between thousand and
ten thousands and crore 
Atleast the basic should be good of maths that is why
 if the basics are not at all proper how can they uh do the eighth
ninth and tenth standard sums 
Addition subtractions are the basics 
So what do you think about that ?
What else efforts should be done ?
No I'm asking you because
Uhn that means here actually they must do more practice
By doing more uhm either sums either that uh writing so
they are going to improve
 No uh 
For example take seventh standard 
 I'm teaching there Maths but I take each and every sum
on the board
I make the students do the sum on the board but uh I
finished my portion in ten to fifteen days earlier 
I take revision but still there are failures in Maths 
So you being a higher uh this teacher I'm asking you
 you give me a the guidence on how should I
prepare the students for Maths ?
Because I'm taking fifth sixth seventh for the first time
Maths so you give me a the guidence so that
 na let the number of student failing be less 
I teach my best because I take each and every sum on the
board I make them solve on the board I take tests also I take revision also
What else should I do ?
One week I go on with only four to five lessons I have done 
So what guidence you may give for that 
 No by doing more practice we can improve
otherwise only that one time it is not possible 
Means what else should I take ?
 I'll take tests also 
I have to take make them I keep I competitions
between the girls and the boys also
 Ah ha 
 I 
Ah so if it uh if you teach that is in one day 
So you can take out there again give the same sums 
All type of students some normal medium and uh
extraordinary 
The extraordinary they are going to take up quick only 
And uh med medium class they can't understand soon 
And you join with that one that uh brilliant one that medium
 and so they are going to that means one by one they are going to discuss
And suddenly they are going to improve 
And we must do uh like before that you told that regarding
competition uhm that is essential competition that 
 Uhm 
No because I take competition between girls and the boys
I make one boy solve if he doesn't no I make one girl solve 
Let the competition spirit be between the both
But even though in for having such a lot of efforts on them 
still in their paper they have done nil might be my paper was hard
 because I didn't 
Ah now 
And I don't trust in giving the paper sums for revision 
Papers we can't say hard only because they already taught
that same 
No same matter I have taught only just I have I jumbled up
the numbers here and there 
All the sums were there in the text book itself but still they
have not done properly in the exam 
Now what else guidence should I give because 
 this week 
 Ah that 
 In that case we 
In that case you must improve their writing only 
Writing and uh uh exercise 
 Means they do the same exercise in classwork
they do the same exercise at homework 
They do it on the board also 
Means what do you think that the basic itself is not good or
 now they are getting interest in maths 
No by doing these all uh that means taking uh test
and uh that this way they are going to improve and we can't say within
that one month either this two month they are going 
 Not one month now two to three months have
become the school has started we finished our first unit test also 
No afterwards that they are impro going to improve
suddenly laughs so step by step 
Our fifth standard also is giving problem 
Do you know even they write one word 
Not even that fifth standard so all the side even
higher classes also the same problem 
Even if we've given many times they can't understand 
and if once one time if they understood they are going to tell soon
they are going to understand 
When after that one week either two weeks leave they can't 
 again the excercise because that means uh
 They'll have one word 
Then
Uh repetition is not there
When we left other that four five days we even that it
is uh we can't tell express our views one word 
But how come we will be every time doing the same thing 
We have to complete our portion within time isn't it ?
And again hammering the same and same and same sums we should
complete our portion also
We should have all the revision also 
How is it possible sir ?
So in only one week daily we must do one one sum 
on that all exercise 
Sir we are having only half an hour period sir how come its
 uh possible to do because in one week time we're having
seven period of maths isn't it ?
Uhn
And in seven period atleast we should complete two to three
excercises in seven period 
One exercise teaching and doing the excercises and their
homework and their classwork then assignments are also there 
And completing this much is impossible sir
Everytime to do one exercise one sum na of
each exercise 
Even it is not possible by even in school also
But in home parents they must take interest 
That is the main thing na here that
would again the main thing that they don't take at all interest in the
 their children at all 
If both husband and wife are working husband should do 
No both not only husband
He should help na laughs 
He should help in their 
 Because if they are working both they must
do both 
And it is not possible uhm either that uh one side only
Either husband or wife who who is getting that
But no sir when
Time
When both of them reach home okay the first thing is the
wife should get up and make tea for her husband why ?
 It's not like that that 
 No that is not rule
No no no
No
 It's like that sir 
Never a husband says that I'll make a cup of tea
okay you sit I'll make a cup of tea never he says everytime
a wife should get up and make 
Both works same hours isn't it ?
Both of them are uh earning ah both of them are
earning for the same house
 Ah I 
Okay it depend upon that even that wife also 
If she did no smoothly one time two time he is going to observe
 and why if she she prepared and she can't give that daily I'm
 preparing this way that way uh if if she started like that only
saying then he will never do 
Husband no I'll do I'll prepare it
If she told and uh suddenly no with you so I'll 
prepare he is going to say that 
It depend upon their that uh 
But I don't think that any husband is willingly
saying that that I'll come to okay you sit for
a while I'll uh prepare a cup of tea for you 
Indian husbands don't think like that you see so
 No no it depend upon that 
 No no don't don't two words 
Uh not Indian husband that depend upon that uh one
word woman 
No no 
It also depends upon the atmosphere in which they live 
because when husbands don't see their fathers working they also don't
work in the house 
My husband doesn't work at all 
He never prepares a cup of tea he never does anything 
Sir sir you prepare tea ?
Oh yes yes laughter I prepared as
So your wife is quite lucky na having you as
a husband sir laughs 
No that uh here was that uhm understand between both the
 husband and wife 
And even she is helping that all at my 
In what ?
Uh that uh in home even uh one word she is also
engaged in that uh regarding home uh uh two words this way
 so we two we help in that she is also get relax 
 No but they say na even now
 for example take that the husband doesn't work at all okay the
boys one word doesn't work at all
And then he gets married okay and he works 
And that time the in-laws start blaming that ahn when you get
married you start working this and that and he stops 
Like that is also they do 
It may depend upon their parents 
No but why do the uh husbands again change a lot ?
They never change 
They change sir how come you say like that 
When everytime you're no it is not possible for your
husband okay to do the work
He is also tired we are also tired isn't it ?
So for this we say sometime to do something 
I don't think that he says generally yes come on
 I'll do it 
Some once in a while once in a blue moon they help they say
that okay okay I'll do but regularly a woman
have to work in the kitchen isn't it ?
Actually that is Indian concept what you say that uh uh
that you'll that man that one word that
Okay okay Indian culture says that women should work 
 yeah isn't it ?
She should cook she should look after the children it's 
alright 
But even if they women is are working
as much as a man she is earning the same uh monthly saving as a
man itself 
Then why should he not work at home ?
Isn't it the ego of the man in which I'm trying
to one word 
 Yeah 
 No he must work if they are working both the
side both husband and even she is getting the same equivalent to him
And there is no difference between a husband and wife because that
 that two are equal weight only 
But they don't think na Indian society never
thinks that man and woman are equal 
Ninety-nine percent of them say that women even if she works for
the whole day she has to look after the kitchen only alone laughs
But don't you think that they are uh changing now 
This is changing
That only I'm saying sir but not uh only sir
 might be in a society seventy-eight percent sir or the in-laws
say that two words 
See for example uh my wife uhm I mean
I do a lot of cooking uhm I enjoy it that's all
But then now that I've become a little old <{3
 uhm I feel it is difficult to do
See I do my one word in the department uh I do my
work and when I come back in the evening 
And when I feel very tired I may even sleep 
So now I'm sixty-five sixty-two now 
But then you know when I was young I used to go uh I
mean my wife she does not work 
She has not work but she had four children 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm
