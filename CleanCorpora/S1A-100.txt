That is for the state they have prepared in nineteen
ninety-three 
Ah ha
About that they want to finalise 
Ah ha 
And they have identified some people 
Ah ha
Uh in each department
Ah ha
And uh they wanted uhm that this person
should go through the D O A draft which they have prepared at S C R T 
 yeah and then to the governments and uh whatever additions
deletions will be there ah ha they should make it and then
hand it over 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Ah ha 
Thats all 
Thats all
 Haan 
And for that probably I think we did a kind of honorary
job uhm uh but the new syllabus and new programme of
action and whatever we decide ultimately ah ha will be the
final one and should reach entire state 
And the all the direction and all the ah ha
 uh schools ah ha will be impleminting this particular
kind of new contents that all we suggest the thing
 Uhm 
 Ah ha 
 Ah ha 
 Ah ha 
I see
Otherwise you know the programme of action actually what to do
 ah ha that we have to suggest to them
 Ah ha 
Ah ha 
They are keeping a book in the sense 
It is in the book for
No no programme of action nahi nahi you

I see
You may recommend for preparation of new contents 
 ah ha a new methodology new approaches new A T or I T

action will be permitted 
 Ah ha

Uh from our college uh because that day I was there I
gave all the names of our college first
Ah ha 
Uh Mrs Katon
Ah ha 
For minorities and or something like that I ask her
Ah ha 
Probably she must have been given minorities and only
accepting that kind of strategy ah ha even that several
 two words ah ha 
Then myself 
 Ah ha 
 Ah ha 
I see
And for English uh Sharma
Ah ha 
Dr Sharma 
Ah ha 
And then uh uh Professor Venkateshwar Rao for Telugu
Ah ha 
And then uh like that quite a good number of people are
drafted
Ah ha 
Uh professor Anwar Jahan for administration
Ah ha 
Is there any chapter on science education also sir ?
Science education is there that was given to you 
No sir they have given 
 There are measurement problems 
Evaluation means ah evaluation measurement
 Ah 
Yeah evaluation measurement must have been given
You are you are dealing with education research also perhaps 
 ah ha that's why
 Ah ha 
Sir before going to the meeting shall I read something and go
or uh 
 Nahi nahi not not necessary because
content point of view ah ha there will be absolutely nothing
 Ah ha 
So need for pre no need preparation
 No need 
No need 
I see
Well you just go
Yeah
And uh you can discuss and prepare a kind of plan
 for action
Uhm uhm 
What we should do ?
You know they they want to know uhn what shall we
do first of all
 Uhn 
Yes sir 
And this these are the things which we you should do 
that you are going to tell them 
Right sir 
And uh while telling uh that you will be uh
already you have prepared a kind of draft or some directons they have given
That is not uh open and one that is almost a special one 
Right sir 
Uh for the structure you have to give final consent 
Right sir
That you know this you should do this we should not do and
ultimately you can say that this can could be taken up this could be
 not be taken up etcetra
I see 
Now that you can complete that way 
Today I have taken leave sir after taking first pay
I know I know I understand I 
As a first pay you know
Infact somebody told me
Ah ha ha 
 That's why uh I was just asking you know 
 ah what your tommorrow's programme ?
 Ah 
Yeah 
By the by a very interesting information yesterday have you
seen Eenadu ?
Yes yes we have discussed already
About Telegu University judge
 We've discussed it we've discussed
I want to go to the court today 
You ?
Yeah myself or uh someone uh who is known to us 
 ah and we want to collect that judgement copy
 Ah 
Yes yes yes
Yes 
That we can manage
Yes because they conducted interviews during elections
 uhm so judgement gave in favour of uh not in favour
of university 
 Uhm 
 That's okay but anything uh 
 It's very positive point
No which one which one is it conducting these elections
are important ah or issuing the orders are important ?
 Ah 
Uh 
Issuing the orders is the main thing isn't it ?
Yeah
That they should note out ah 
Ah
That part they have to stress not conducting the
interview 
Interview you can conduct at any time there's no problem
Ah ha 
That is that are for that also there are some restrictions
 Nahi but you know we don't fall in that 
in that provision that's all
Because this is in September
November and September yes 
Elections uh held in November uh December
Uh elections elections were last month November
Uh December sir 
Yes
December first and December fifth 
No no 
They are telling
No the elections notification came on first or second
November isn't it ?
Right sir
Since 
 Haan 
Uh this uh as far as the severe circumstance
they won't come under the perview of ah ha this category
 Ah ha 
But uh it seems Eiliah told to Tirupat that they
should not no organisation should conduct interviews before three
months 
That we don't know because ah ha from the
date of notification is of course we know
 Ah ha 
I see
Uh date of notification came at what time ?
Ah ha 
Was it in September ?
Notiification came in the month of July 
No no no no
 Haan 
This notification must have come somewhere in the month of
October or so
Ah ha
Exact dates you know 
Ah ha
Our first time elections were held in Andhra Pradesh 
 yeah yeah that kind of notification 
 Yeah yeah 
And primarily you know the the issue orders were issued
on fifth that is on the election day itself 
 That is wrong 
That is wrong
That is wrong
 Haan that is wrong 
On the election day they should not issue 
Yeah 
And specially these elections the orders should not be
given
Uhm 
Because the candidates if they are if they belong to
a particular community or category or uh political party they the
what you call the wave reaction will be there isn't it ?
Uhm 
A ripple of it 
Yes sir 
And the ripple of it goes to larger communities and then they
begin claims and vote for this a particular section 
Yeah yeah
Thats how
Uhm 
These election orders also should not be given
Ah 
But they may argue they will say on first we have not given
because ah on first uh the election in the city was there
 Ah 
Right sir 
When they only ripple in the but in the Telangana region was
there anywhere 
Yeah yeah in entire north Telangana ah uh
there was a that was election day
 Ah 
Uh then it is alright 
And then we you have a chance
Yeah 
Because uh north Telangana means Osmania jurisdiction 
one or two 
Yes sir 
Nizamabad
Yeah 
Ah ha then its alright
Yes 
Nizamabad comes under Osmania isn't it ?
Yeah yeah 
Not Kakatiya 
Yes sir
Okay then we can take it up
Yes sir 
Its okay then that part is that way
Yes sir 
Today what are your plans sir today ?
Are you coming ?
No somebody is coming ah ha at two thirty
 Ah ha 
 Accha 
 I'll wait for them Shrinivas is here now
Ah ha 
And then you could have
 That's great
No now he has come back 
Ah ha 
I think uh he understood things
Ah ha 
He went to Namrata institution and was saying it all that
Now he realised 
A little bit not fully 
Still uh of course its okay we'll slowly console
him
Uhm yes sir
Sometimes some consolation should be given to him
Yes sir
And already one project is there in hand
Yeah yeah C I R
From that I can divert the funds to him
Yes sir 
Already he has done some amount also
Yeah yeah of course there is uh only five or six thousand
Yeah 
Other thing also we can give what is there we've 
the amount together yes but then unfortunately that thing
is not working thats all 
 Yes 
Yeah yeah
Uhn
Yeah
He needs money 
Yeah yeah
He is a brilliant boy but uh somehow ah ha
 psycologically he is upset 
 Ah ha 
Ah ha 
Thats the point
Ramakrishna has come today ?
No he is on leave today 
Ah ha Ramakrishna is on leave
I think so because he has not applied ah ha
 he may apply tomorrow
 Ah ha

giving his application
