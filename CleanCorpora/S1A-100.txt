 ?
""
""
The dealing 
""
""
The same type of
""
""
That some of it are to be changed
""
""
Okay sir
""
""
Because  that is from my point of view
""
requirements and needs perhaps  and probably I think uh
you have to  ah ha
 about your own
grievences or whatever fresh points are there  that we
have to put it down and then write isn't it ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
Sir about that Chaya I received a letter from uh  the director
of uh  could you
tell me something about it sir  ?
""
Even I don't know anything about it 
""
""
""
""
""
See 
""
""
Ah
""
""
The nineteen eighty-six 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
 I mean that
New Education Policy is there isn't it ?
""
""
""
""
""
Right sir 
""
""
National policy of Education
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uh  uh programme of action
 for the state
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is for the state they have prepared in nineteen
ninety-three 
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
About that they want to finalise 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
And they have identified some people 
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Uh  in each department
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
And uh  that this person
should go through the D O A draft which they have prepared at S C R T 
 and then to the governments and uh whatever additions
deletions will be there  they should make it and then
hand it over 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Thats all 
""
""
Thats all
""
""
""
""
""
And for that  probably I think we did a kind of honorary
job  but the new syllabus and new programme of
action and whatever we decide ultimately  will be the
final one 
""
And the all the  ah ha
 will be impleminting this particular
kind of  new contents that all we suggest the thing
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see
""
""
Otherwise you know the programme of action actually what to do
 that we have to suggest to them
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
They are keeping a book in the sense 
""
It is in the book for
""
""
No no programme of action  you
can you can recommend for preparation of new books 
""
""
I see
""
""
You may recommend for preparation of new contents 
""
 whatever you suggest
 then the
action will be permitted 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

Evaluation means  evaluation measurement

You are you are dealing with education research also perhaps 
 why
""
""
""
""
""
Sir before going to the meeting shall I read something and go
or uh 
""
""
 not necessary because
content point of view  there will be absolutely nothing
""
""
""
""
""
So need for  preparation
""
""
""
""
""
No need 
""
""
I see
""
""
Well you just go
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And uh  plan
 for action
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
What we should do ?
""
You know they they want to know  what shall we
do first of all
""
""
""
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
And this these are the things which we 
that you are going to tell them 
""
""
Right sir 
""
""
And uh  uh
already you have prepared a kind of draft or some directons they have given
""
That is not uh open and one that is almost a special one 
""
""
Right sir 
""
""
Uh for the structure you have to give final consent 
""
""
Right sir
""
""
That you know this you should do this we should not do and
ultimately you can say that  be
 etcetra
""
""
I see 
""
""
Now that you can complete that way 
""
""
Today I have taken leave sir after taking first pay
""
""
I know I know I understand I 
""
""
As a first pay you know
""
""
Infact somebody told me
""
""
Ah ha ha 
""
""
""
 programme ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
By the by a very interesting information  yesterday have you
seen Eenadu  ?
""
""
Yes yes we have discussed already
""
""
About Telegu University  judge
""
""
 discussed
""
""
I want to go to the court today 
""
""
You  ?
""
""
Yeah myself or uh 
 and we want to collect that judgement copy
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes yes
""
""
Yes 
""
""
That we can manage
""
""
Yes  because they conducted interviews during elections
 not in favour
of university 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 very positive point
""
""
No which one which one  is it conducting these elections
are important  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Issuing the orders is the main thing isn't it ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
That they should note out ah 
""
""
Ah
""
""
That part they have to stress  not conducting the
interview 
""
Interview you can conduct at any time  no problem
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
That is  that are for that also there are some restrictions
""
""
""
in that provision  all
""
""
Because this is in September
""
""
November and September yes 
""
""
Elections uh held in November uh  December
""
""
Uh elections  November
""
""
Uh December sir 
""
""
Yes
""
""
December first and December fifth 
""
""
No no 
""
""
They are telling
""
""
No  the elections notification came on first or second
November isn't it ?
""
""
Right sir
""
""
Since 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh this  circumstance
they won't come under the perview of  this category
""
""
""
""
""
But uh  that they
should not  before three
months 
""
""
That we don't know because  from the
date of notification is of course we know
""
""
""
""
""
I see
""
""
Uh date of notification came  at what time ?
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
Was it in September  ?
""
""
Notiification came in the month of July 
""
""
No no no no
""
""
""
""
""
This notification must have come somewhere in the month of
October or so
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Exact dates you know 
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Our first time elections were held in Andhra Pradesh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And primarily you know  the the issue orders were issued
on fifth that is on 
""
""
""
""
That is wrong
""
""
That is wrong
""
""
""
""
On the election day they should not issue 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And specially these elections  the orders should not be
given
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Because  if they belong to
a particular community or category or uh  the
what you call  ?
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
A ripple of it 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
And the ripple of it goes to larger communities and then they
begin claims and vote for this 
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
Thats how
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
These election orders also should not be given
""
""
Ah 
""
""
But they may argue they will say on first we have not given
because  the election in the city was there
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right sir 
""
""
When they only ripple in the but in the Telangana region was
there anywhere 
""
""
Yeah yeah in entire north Telangana  uh
there was a  that was election day
""
""
""
""
""
Uh then it is alright 
""
And then we you have a chance
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Because 
one or two 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Nizamabad

""

""
""
Ah ha then its alright
""
""
