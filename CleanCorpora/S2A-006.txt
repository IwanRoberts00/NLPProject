<I>
 It's uh time now to begin the last journey
 from Teen Murti where he has been lying still 
Twenty second afternoon 
And here Shakti Sthal ten kilometres 
the banks of the Yamuna next to his mother 
On the night of this twenty first May the laugh of her life
 was brutely snatched away making a reality of a worst tragedy 
Most often she was by his side whether rain or shine 
 but not too strong 
This time noise life at Teen Murti 
and around the country fly half mast 
Grief stricken people have been queing for hours and through the
night since that fateful night of the twenty first to pay homage
 to a young and vigorous leader with a boyish smile and a jaunty
step that endeared him to so many 
Still and silent now 
Swollen crowds wear a mute testimony to the closing chapter
He leaves his wife and two children bereft and the nation
plunged in destiny 
The scene of twenty years of his life 
 Teen Murti has recorded the joys and trivia 
his ecstasies and the agonies of three generations of his time 
A large number almost forty of visiting dignitories from
around the world attending today pay tribute to this young leader 
who was a charming and versatile diplomat a loving father a good
friend of his country 
The state funeral with full military honour begins in a short
while from now 
The gun carriage the guest and slouch carries to
the scene for a one word 
Rajiv Gandhi the son of Indira Gandhi and grandson of
Jawaharlal Nehru bore the mantle of political responsibility easily
 if with a certain reluctance 
Once he did so he threw himself heart and soul into the role
He was in a hurry for change and progress 
A driving force into the twenty-first century which 
he will now never see 
Priyanka consoling her mother 
Priyanka consoling her mother 
Losing a husband losing a father a loving friend whose
smile could charm a heart of stone 
For them he was not a leader or Prime Minister or politician
He was papa 
The funeral procession will be led by Major General S C Kashyap
 General Officer commanding Delhi area 
Two platoons of the army one of the Navy and two of the Airforce
 accompany the gun carriage 
Immediately behind the gun carriage comes a firing party 
which will be followed by the chief mourners 
The mourners in uniform and those not in uniform 
Forty officers of the three services of the rank of Major
General or Brigadier have maintained continuous vigil from two 
O'clock on the twenty second till now 
 Teen Murti is at the moment a novice of
the quite with the chanting people outside the world and stretching
 the heart right down the route of the Shakti Sthal
 
Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar shouting in the background
And for us the people of India we have many bleeding hearts to
heal 
We have yet another scar on the fabric of our country 
A one word of another assassination 
We have to struggle once again for that political maturity
 that will allow the voice of democracy to be heard unhindered 
When leaders do not have to fall at the altar of our
insecurity 
From around the world international leaders have expressed
their shock grief hurt indignation and today many of them
have come or sent their representatives to pay their last respects 
I never thought I would have to witness this scene again 
within a span of six and a half years 
A day of tragedy a day of shame 
He played the game in a stupendous drive of energy and committment
He went from state to state knowing the people with a tireless
drive 
Now a martyr to democracy 
And why ?
Why the best reluctant politician who sacrificed his
professional flying career to join his mother after his brother's 
death ?
Why that this dynamic young man who took success and defeat in
a stride have to be struck down when he was playing the game according
to the rule ?
Now still silent shattered forever suspended in
a tragedy in a nightmarish act that defies all norms of justice and
fairplay 
The childhood years of Rajiv Gandhi were spent here happy
years 
Where now his body lies in one word cold and
still 
Fate and assassin have claimed the lives of the
mother and her two sons in a span of a little over one decade
 shouting in the background 
Too young to die too young to be a martyr too full of
life and plans for the future to be struck down so brutally 
Apart from close friends and relatives the main three pall
bearers will be the chiefs of the Army Navy and Airforce 
General S F Rodrigues Admiral L Ramdas and Airchief
Marshall S K Mehra 
Helicopter patrolling the sky security 
As they lift him from what was home for twenty years to
bring him out to the gun carriage 
Till eleven O'clock this morning the crowds were here 
paying their last respects and then there were moments of privacy
The helicopter showering petals as the body is brought out
As the helicopter showers petals on the gun carriage he
is now handed over to the people 
Moments to be recorded in history memories to be engraved
on our hearts 
They called him one of the brightest and bravest sons of India
They called it a blow to Indian politics 
They called out a shock nation 
 Now in slow march the procession begins 
And so he leaves Teen Murti for the last
march to the banks of the Yamuna 
We capture it on film 
We give him the ceremony but there are no words to
express the heinousness of this crime 
Too young to die 
 Now 
Our next live telecast will be when the gun carriage 
and the procession arrives at Cannaught Circle 
In between recorded excerpts from supporting camera crew 
will be brought to you from Vijay Chowk and India Gate 
We now return you from Teen Murti to the
studios of Doordarshan 
 I'm now speaking to you from the studios of 
Doordarshan 
These are the scenes captured by our supporting camera crew as
the funeral procession moves towards Vijay chowk 
It is now moving on towards Cannaught Circle 
The people have been waiting at Vijay Chowk from noon 
unmindful of the scorching heat just to catch a final glimpse 
of their beloved leader 
Perhaps Summer afternoon with the temperature in there 
forty the crowds braving the May heat waiting along the routes 
to catch final glimpse 
The funeral procession winding its way at snail pace 
towards Shakti Sthal on the banks of the Yamuna 
The route is long ten kilometres from Teen Murti
 to Shakti Sthal 
Mortal remains of the ex-Prime Minister move slowly down 
to its final destination 
People rushing breaking the cordon to have a last glimpse 
With full military honours the tunes of the Army the
Navy and the Airforce precede the gun carriage 
The funeral procession is lead by the General Officer commanding
Delhi area Major General S C Kashyap 
Braving the scorching heat they give vent to their grief
 shouting in the background 
And now down Rajpath 
The procession had left Teen Murti around one 
thirty and is making very slow progress as the people impede
 the route shouting in the background 
We have recorded these scenes because it is not possible to have a
continuous microwave uplink at all spots along the route 
So the next live telecast will be from Cannaught Circle 
Honours for a young leader cut down in his prime 
Leaders around the world had expressed their indignation 
 We are filled with indignation over the appaling and
heinous crime 
He was a personal friend of ours Mr Gorbachov 
The long route to eternity showered with petals 
Chanting of mantras at the background 
 We're now waiting for the funeral procession to
arrive 
The funeral cortege carrying the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi
on route to this place has been passing through the streets and avenues
of Delhi with surging crowds thronging the routes bidding farewell to a
beloved leader with tears and emotions in memory to someone who we've
 tragically lost forever 
And it's a sad and depressive moment as we await the
arrival of the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi here at a spot close to
 Shakti Sthal where they will be confined to flames 
Close by this spot where our former Prime Minister Mrs Indira
Gandhi Mr Rajiv Gandhi's mother was cremated less then seven
years ago 
Mrs Gandhi had fallen to the assassins bullets at her residence one
Safdarjang road New Delhi 
Today as we await the arrival of the mortal remains of Rajiv Gandhi
 it still seems impossible to come to terms with the enormity of this
ghastly and unbelievable tragedy 
A bad despicable moment a bad night when Rajiv Gandhi was
brutally killed 
Our hearts are filled with anguish and sadness 
Perhaps the hundreds of millions that make up this vast and
vibrant country it is a moment for us to hang our heads in utter shame 
There is toll of gloom only broken by the recital of devotional
songs 
The atmosphere steep in this sorrow of the appaling tragedy that
left behind pain and grief and inspeakable faith after this abolutely
shameful and dasterdly crime 
As many of here saint says and eyes brimming with tears and 
many left numb by the senseless tragedy 
We have many world leaders here represented in large numbers 
at Mr Rajiv Gandhi's funeral with over sixty delegations from
the world over who've been coming in since yesterday to pay
their last respect to the departed leader 
Large crowds have gathered here today outside the cordons area
oblivious of the heat and the dust and scortching winds 
All here to mourn the loss of our former Prime Minister whom they
loved and cheered 
A leader whom they showered their love on and who in turn returned
their affection and warmth in his untiring attempt to keep the interests
of the common man closest to his heart 
Today the spot where Mr Rajiv Gandhi's life last rites
are to be performed was chosen by his daughter Priyanka who visited the
site day before yesterday and then a couple of times thereafter to see how
the arrangements were progressing 
Not too far away are the spots where Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr
Sanjay Gandhi were cremated 
And today the mortal remains of Rajiv Gandhi are consigned to
the flames
It will be a time that'll echo as the last few days
have some of the bleakest darkest and most depressing moments of our
history 
In a span of eleven years three members of the Gandhi family 
victims of violence tragic and untimely end 
Those in their last journeys to this vicinity on the banks of the
river Yamuna 
Now the family the immediate close family Priyanka and Mrs
Sonia Gandhi placing sandalwood atop the funeral Pa pa

Here we can see Prime Minister Chandrasekhar next to him is

And the whole world still time almost stopping by to mourn
the going away of one of the greatest leader's of our time 
Rajiv you're going to remain in our hearts and in our
memories as an indelible part of Indian and world history 
Our images of you will never fade till memory 
India prays for you and may the prayers of each and every
person who loves you as your soul rests in peace 
India will miss you
