""
 to begin the last journey
""
""
Twenty second afternoon 
""
And here 
the banks of the Yamuna 
""
On the night of this twenty first May  the laugh of her life
""
""
Most often she was by his side 
""
""
This time 
and around the country fly half mast 
""
Grief stricken people  have been queing for hours and through the
night  to pay homage
 with a boyish smile and a jaunty
step 
""
Still and silent now 
""
Swollen crowds  to the closing chapter
""
""
He leaves his wife and two children bereft  and the nation
plunged in destiny 
""
The scene of twenty years of his life 
""
""
his ecstasies 
""
A large number  of visiting dignitories from
around the world attending today 
who was a charming and versatile diplomat  a good
friend 
""
The state funeral with full military honour  begins in a short
while from now 
""
The gun carriage  carries to
the scene 
""
Rajiv Gandhi the son of  Indira Gandhi and grandson of
Jawaharlal Nehru  easily
""
""
Once he did so  he threw himself heart and soul into the role
""
""
He was in a hurry for change and progress 
""
A driving force 
he will now 
""
Priyanka 
""
Priyanka 
""
Losing a husband  a loving friend whose
smile could charm a heart of stone 
""
For them  he was not a leader or Prime Minister or politician
""
""
He was papa 
""
The funeral procession will be led by Major General S C Kashyap
""
""
Two platoons of the army one of the Navy and two of the Airforce
""
""
Immediately behind the gun carriage 
which will be followed by the chief mourners 
""
The mourners in uniform 
""
Forty officers of the three services  of the rank of Major
General or Brigadier 
O'clock 
""
 a novice of
the quite  and stretching
 Shakti Sthal
""
""
Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar  shouting in the background
""
""
And for us the people of India  we have many bleeding hearts to
heal 
""
We have yet another scar 
""
A 
""
We have to struggle once again  for that political maturity
""
""
When leaders  at the altar of our
insecurity 
""
From around the world  international leaders have expressed
their shock  and today many of them
have come or sent their representatives 
""
I never thought I would have to witness this scene again 
within a span of six and a half years 
""
A day of tragedy 
""
He played the game in a stupendous drive of energy and committment
""
""
He went from state to state  knowing the people with a tireless
drive 
""
Now 
""
And why  ?
""
Why the best reluctant politician  his
professional flying career to join his mother after his 
death  ?
""
Why that this dynamic young man  who took success and defeat in
a stride have to be struck down  when he was playing the game according
to the rule  ?
""
Now still  in
a tragedy  in a nightmarish act that defies all norms of justice and
fairplay 
""
The childhood years of Rajiv Gandhi were spent here  happy
years 
""
Where now his body lies in  and
still 
""
Fate  of the
mother  of a little over one decade
""
""
Too young to die  too full of
life and plans for the future 
""
Apart from close friends and relatives  the main three pall
bearers 
""
General S F Rodrigues  and Airchief
Marshall S K Mehra 
""
Helicopter patrolling the sky 
""
As they lift him  to
bring him out to the gun carriage 
""
Till eleven 
paying their last respects  there were moments of privacy
""
""
The helicopter showering petals  as the body is brought out
""
""
As the helicopter showers petals  he
is now 
""
Moments to be  memories to be engraved
on our hearts 
""
They called him  one of the brightest and bravest sons of India
""
""
They called it 
""
They called out 
""
""
""
And so he leaves  for the last
march 
""
We capture it on film 
""
We give him the ceremony  to
express 
""
Too young to die 
""
""
""
""
""
Our next live telecast 
and the procession arrives at Cannaught Circle 
""
In between 
will be brought to you from Vijay Chowk and India Gate 
""
We now return you from  to the
studios of 
""
""
Doordarshan 
""
These are the scenes captured by our supporting camera crew  as
the funeral procession 
""
It is now moving on towards Cannaught Circle 
""
The people have been waiting at Vijay Chowk 
unmindful of the scorching heat 
of their beloved leader 
""
Perhaps 
forty 
to catch final glimpse 
""
The funeral procession winding its way 
towards 
""
The route is long  Teen Murti
""
""
Mortal remains of the ex-Prime Minister 
to its final destination 
""
People rushing breaking the cordon to have a last glimpse 
""
With full  the
Navy 
""
The funeral procession is lead by the General Officer commanding
Delhi area

Braving the scorching heat  to their grief
""
""
And now down 
""
The procession had left 
thirty  impede
""
""
We have recorded these scenes because it is not possible to have a
continuous microwave 
""
So the next live 
""
Honours for a young leader 
""
Leaders around the world had expressed 
""
 over the appaling and
heinous crime 
""
He was a personal friend of ours 
""
The long route to eternity 
Chanting of 
""
""
 now waiting for the funeral procession to
arrive 
""
The funeral cortege carrying the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi
on route to this place  has been passing through the streets and avenues
of Delhi with surging crowds thronging the routes  bidding farewell to a
beloved leader with tears and emotions  we've
""
""
And  a sad and depressive moment as we await the
arrival of the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi  here at a spot close to
""
""
Close by this spot where our former Prime Minister Mrs Indira
Gandhi  mother was cremated less then seven
years ago 
""
Mrs Gandhi had fallen to the assassins bullets at her residence one
Safdarjang road New Delhi 
""
Today as we await the arrival of the mortal remains of Rajiv Gandhi
 it still seems impossible to come to terms with the enormity of this
ghastly and unbelievable tragedy 
""
A bad despicable moment  a bad night when Rajiv Gandhi was
brutally killed 
""
Our hearts are filled with anguish and sadness 
""
Perhaps the hundreds of millions that make up this vast and
vibrant country it is a moment for us to hang our heads in utter shame 
""
There is toll of gloom only broken by the recital of devotional
songs 
""
The atmosphere steep in this sorrow of the appaling tragedy that
left behind pain and grief  and inspeakable faith after this abolutely
shameful and dasterdly crime 
""
As many of here saint says and eyes brimming with tears and 
many left numb by the senseless tragedy 
""
We have many world leaders here represented in large numbers 
at Mr Rajiv  with over sixty delegations from
the world over  been coming in since yesterday to pay
their last respect to the 
""
Large crowds have gathered here today outside the cordons area
oblivious of the heat and the dust and scortching winds 
""
All here to mourn the loss of our former Prime Minister whom they
loved and cheered 
""
A leader whom they showered their love on and who in turn returned
their affection and warmth in his untiring attempt  to keep the interests
of the common man 
""
Today the spot where Mr Rajiv  life last rites
are to be performed  was chosen by his daughter Priyanka who visited the
site day before yesterday and then a couple of times thereafter to see how
the arrangements were progressing 
""
Not too far away are the spots where Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr
Sanjay Gandhi were cremated 
""
And today the mortal remains of  Rajiv Gandhi are consigned to
the flames
""
It will be  echo as the last few days
have  some of the bleakest darkest and most depressing moments of our
history
