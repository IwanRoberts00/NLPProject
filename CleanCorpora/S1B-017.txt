""
""
Well  that
I  have already started
""
Do you know  to
""
""
""
Malefactor Malefactor
""
""
Malefactor  right
""
""
And I do hope that  by now all of you might have read the lesson
""
""
Right  ?
""
The first question that we are going to raise today for discussion
 ?
""
Do you justify the title of the story  ?
""
I mean you  ?
""
Would you  ?
""
 ?
""
""
Sir the chapter raise the 
 criminal but uh like
 he opens the
screw unknowingly
""
Right he doesn't know that it is really a crime 
""
Actually he does it unknowingly 
""
""
So what you mean that he is not a criminal  ?
""
""
No he isn't
""
""
Right 
""
Yes please what do you have to say  ?
""
""
That the title Malefactor  uh
 Denis because he is not a
criminal and he doesn't uh  commit the act knowingly
""
He just  tells the judge also
that he had done  a professional
criminal
""
""
Okay if we turn the pages of our  text we will find that he
knows  that unscrewing of the nuts may lead to the rail
accident 
""
If you see the line 
we know that it may lead to the train accident  why we don't
unscrew all the nuts 
""
""
Sir he doesn't  say that we know that accident will occur
as a result so he says that we know that  the nut holds the railway track
""
""
Right
""
""
Sir he says that nuts cannot cause an accident
""
""
No not that one
""
But he does  that if we unscrew all the nuts
 causing the loss of life and
property 
""
He does know 
""
What are the other clues by that you can justify the title  ?
""
You can't say that here  not
""
""
""
Sir first thing he said that he was  very poor man
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
It was when that he said 
uh uh on the street  so he was
 very poor man
""
So  pluck out nut from the track
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
Perhaps you would  mean to say that while judging him as a
criminal we must 
""
The circumstances 
""
We find that he is such a poor man  that he is not in a
position to buy the  as he is
pleading again and again that  did unscrew the nuts only to
""
""
Perhaps his financial condition is not so that he may buy the 
other thing 
""
Isn't so  ?
""
Anything else that you have to say  ?
""
Yes 
""
Anything  ?
""
You wanted to tell something  ?
""
No 
""
Then  ?
""
Is there any other clue  whereby you can prove that he is not a
criminal  ?
""
The one thing that you have clarified is that 
demand of the circumstances or he is pressed by the circumstances  that's
 the nuts
""
Anything else  ?
""
""
The criminal was not an educated 
""
""
He is not an educated one
""
""
Educated man and even he doesn't know  anything about the
 track anything that it can cause accident by plucking out of the lines
""
""
Right 
""
May be accepted 
""
""
Sir lot of whole society 
but an individual cannot be termed  unscrewed the nut
 rules of the society is also there
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
There 
when  other people of the community are also doing the
same thing 
""
""
Sir he doesn't hide the name of anyone  but he tells two or
three names more to the judge
""
""
Right
""
""
This shows that he was not a criminal 
""
""
But one thing is there  suppose if the majority of the
people are doing the same thing 
it's  ?
""
Can you  ?
""
If  does it means
uh  it is not a crime
because the large number of people are doing so 
""
So how can we accept this one that because not only Denis but other
fellows are also doing 
""
Other members of the community are also doing  why
""
""
""
It is a 
""
""
Sir it is a crime 
""
""
It is a ?
""
""
Crime 
""
""
If it is a crime then you might be justifying the punishment
too  given to him
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Denis does qualify as a criminal with one more reason because
 committer does the crime knowingly
""
""
And so he did it do it knowingly 
""
Right
""
""
It was stated in the law 
""
""
Means the gravity of the punishment should also  take care
of whether something is done knowingly 
""
What is the intention of the  person doing a particular offence
 uh
taken care of 
""
So  ?
""
""
No 
""
""
Was there any bad intention ?
""
""
No sir
""
""
No 
""
So  rail
accident  then he must not be given that
much severe punishment 
""
He should not be levelled as a criminal 
""
Why  ?
""
Because he did it without knowing 
""
So if we sum up the things we can say  that it
is the  that made him
to 
""
Second thing is that  his intention is not bad
""
He is doing it unknowingly 
""
There is no any bad intention of  causing the rail accident
 no intention
""
Anything else  ?
""
On the ground of that you can say that he doesn't deserve that much
severe punishment 
""
Is there any more points  ?
""
Can you recollect  ?
""
Yes 
""
Can you  ?
""
""
No 
""
""
No 
""
Anybody else 
thereby who can say that the title  Malefactor is not
appropriate one  ?
""
Yes ?
""
""
The society around him  that
they made him 
""
But the role 
""
""
That is the  ?
""
""
The whole world of the 
depend on society 
""
""
How the society is responsible  ?
""
""
Because he says that  wise men and the
uh 
""
""
Right 
""
""
It means that from the childhood he is  made to do the
same thing 
""
""
Now that we have already taken  that is more number of the
people do the same thing that is  an offence
""
We cannot say that it is not an offence 
""
Sit down please sit down 
""
Yes anything else 
""
So  in your view the title of the story is not appropriate one
 ?
""
""
No sir
""
""
Can you think of  can you substitute any other appropriate
title to the story ?
""
If this one is not appropriate  give any
appropriate title to the story  ?
""
Can you think of any new title to the story  ?
""
""
Sir poverty is great crime 
""
""
Poverty create crime 
""
""
Poverty  ?
""
""
Create crime 
""
""
Poverty creates crime and  why only poverty ignorance is
also with that  ?
""
""
Sir 
""
""
Innocent criminal 
""
Then the title suggested is  Innocent
Criminal 
""
What is your  to it ?
""
""
Sir  cannot be
called innocent no 
""
The criminal cannot be 
innocent  he is a criminal sir but sir he is a
""
""
""
""
""
Sir but sir he is innocent 
""
""
Sir he is little bit innocent 
""
""
Yes sit down 
""
Okay  one
of the merit of the title is to create interest in the story too 
""
If it is an innocent criminal  then perhaps you will be
interested to learn 
""
It may create some interest too 
""
Can you think of similar title  ?
""
On the same line can you  ?
""
Okay if not  according to you what type of punishment does he
deserve 
""
In case 
""
""
""
""
""
In case he is not a criminal one  but he has done
something wrong you know 
""
Knowingly  whatever is there but he has done
something wrong and he has been caught 
""
What type of punishment  ?
""
Yes  ?
""
""
He has to reveal the plan 
that they are but not the individual particular in society  to be taught
as  they had
deliberately done 
""
""
""
""
""
Then one thing perhaps you want to say  that we will take
this one as a feedback  and educate the society
""
Tell the people  they
must not do 
""
He must be  instructed like that one and should be released or
any other punishment  ?
""
""
He should be 
""
""
Yes please  ?
""
""
He should be let off with a warning or at the most he should
be imprison for one or two months 
""
""
He should be given  ?
""
""
Imprisonment at the most for one or two months  not too
much 
""
""
Right 
""
Not more than one or two months 
""
Anything else  ?
""
Vishal  ?
""
You know the  target what is the aim of the
punishment  ?
""
Just to bring improvement 
""
Just to bring the improvement as well as  to check the further
crime too 
""
So  given either a very light
punishment  with some warning
""
""
Another one 
and government or the agency should take it as a feedback  tell
or educate the other people regarding the  that they should
not do it 
""
Right  ?
""
They should be told they should be  that it
is something wrong  very wrong it may lead to severe punishment and they
should not do 
""
Right  mass awakening
""
Anything else  ?
""
Anything else  in the capacity of a magistrate that you would
like to  ?
""
""
Sir  the presence of that many people in the village as
petty according to famous man also do uh  make that uh net so he wants
more nut in that
""
So  mass awareness is needed to educate all the
village and warn them  that they had to do no more plucking of the nut
from track site
""
""
Right 
""
I do agree with you  such a
 should not be given a very severe punishment
""
Atleast one or two chances must be given to him to improve himself
""
""
And 
shown 
""
I think that such honest fellows if given the chance they will
improve 
""
They will realise the 
""
Understood  ?
""
You know  Denis doesn't understand that
what for he is being sent to prison 
""
Till the very end he doesn't understand that what for he is being
sent to the prison 
""
Right  ?
""
Why  ?
""
He is punished  given a very severe punishment
""
""
He doesn't know  he couldn't understand it
""
Why  ?
""
Or  what are the
crimes in his eyes  ?
""
According to him  ?
""
""
He thinks that 
""
""
He thinks that unscrewing a  nut from the rail track is
not a crime at all 
""
Then what are the crimes in his eyes ?
""
Yes  ?
""
""
That his brother was not paying the tax 
""
""
He thinks 
""
""
His brother was not paying the tax
""
""
And he is being sent to for his  crime
""
""
He thinks that those who fight they must be punished and he hasn't
""
""
Right 
""
Yes  ?
""
""
Denis uh says stealing
""
""
Stealing is punishable 
""
So  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Don't you think  ?
""
""
""
""
""
He has done unknowingly 
""
""
He did it unknowingly 
""
Right 
""
""
He is not stealing the tax 
""
""
He
""
""
Not stealing tax
""
""
 he
deserves the punishment 
""
Right  ?
""
""
Sir coming for judgement
""
""
What  ?
""
""
Sir there is one thing that he never 
""
""
Please sit down 
""
Yes  ?
""
So I think  and he
thinks that 
""
He has not fought with anyone  he has paid his taxes
""
""
So he doesn't deserve the  punishment
""
Understood  ?
""
 why till the very end he couldn't convince himself
""
""
Though he was found criminal in the eyes of the law  but he
couldn't convince himself that he is a criminal 
""
Okay 
""
So is there any confusion  ?
""
""
""
""
""
No sir 
""
""
Or is there any other questions that  got in
your mind  ?
""
Anyone
