""
""
Well  that
""
""
Do you know  to
""
""
""
""
""
""
Malefactor  right
""
""
And I do hope that  by now all of you might have read the lesson
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I mean you  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 criminal but uh like
""
""
""
""
""
Actually he does it unknowingly 
""
""
So what you mean that he is not a criminal  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That the title Malefactor  uh
""
criminal and he doesn't uh  commit the act knowingly
""
""
""
criminal
""
""
Okay if we turn the pages of our  text we will find that he
""
accident 
""
""
we know that it may lead to the train accident  why we don't
unscrew all the nuts 
""
""
Sir he doesn't  say that we know that accident will occur
""
""
""
Right
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
property 
""
""
""
What are the other clues by that you can justify the title  ?
""
You can't say that here  not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  pluck out nut from the track
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Perhaps you would  mean to say that while judging him as a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
criminal  ?
""
The one thing that you have clarified is that 
demand of the circumstances or he is pressed by the circumstances  that's
""
""
""
""
""
The criminal was not an educated 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 rules of the society is also there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
three names more to the judge
""
""
Right
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
because the large number of people are doing so 
""
""
fellows are also doing 
""
""
""
""
""
It is a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
too  given to him
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Means the gravity of the punishment should also  take care
of whether something is done knowingly 
""
""
""
""
""
So  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
""
""
""
to 
""
Second thing is that  his intention is not bad
""
""
""
""
 no intention
""
""
""
""
severe punishment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Can you  ?
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
Anybody else 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is the  ?
""
""
The whole world of the 
depend on society 
""
""
How the society is responsible  ?
""
""
Because he says that  wise men and the
uh 
""
""
Right 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  in your view the title of the story is not appropriate one
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
appropriate title to the story  ?
""
Can you think of any new title to the story  ?
""
""
Sir poverty is great crime 
""
""
Poverty create crime 
""
""
""
""
""
Create crime 
""
""
""
also with that  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Innocent criminal 
""
""
Criminal 
""
What is your  to it ?
""
""
""
called innocent no 
""
""
innocent  he is a criminal sir but sir he is a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of the merit of the title is to create interest in the story too 
""
If it is an innocent criminal  then perhaps you will be
""
""
""
""
""
""
On the same line can you  ?
""
Okay if not  according to you what type of punishment does he
""
""
In case 
""
""
""
""
""
""
something wrong you know 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
as  they had
deliberately done 
""
""
""
""
""
Then one thing perhaps you want to say  that we will take
""
""
Tell the people  they
""
""
He must be  instructed like that one and should be released or
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
be imprison for one or two months 
""
""
He should be given  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not more than one or two months 
""
""
""
Vishal  ?
""
""
punishment  ?
""
""
""
Just to bring the improvement as well as  to check the further
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
or educate the other people regarding the  that they should
not do it 
""
""
""
""
""
should not do 
""
""
""
""
""
""
like to  ?
""
""
Sir  the presence of that many people in the village as
""
more nut in that
""
""
village and warn them  that they had to do no more plucking of the nut
from track site
""
""
Right 
""
""
 should not be given a very severe punishment
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think that such honest fellows if given the chance they will
""
""
They will realise the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why  ?
""
Or  what are the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He thinks that unscrewing a  nut from the rail track is
""
""
Then what are the crimes in his eyes ?
""
Yes  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
His brother was not paying the tax
""
""
And he is being sent to for his  crime
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
He is not stealing the tax 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
deserves the punishment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  ?
""
""
thinks that 
""
He has not fought with anyone  he has paid his taxes
""
""
So he doesn't deserve the  punishment
""
""
""
 why till the very end he couldn't convince himself
""
""
Though he was found criminal in the eyes of the law  but he
couldn't convince himself that he is a criminal 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No sir 
""
""
""
""
""
""
