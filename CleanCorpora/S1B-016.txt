Hydrogen can occur in which two states  ?
""
""
""
""
We get the atom in the free state
""

Give the example where  where it is occuring in the free
""

Rakesh  in the other state give me the examples ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
minerals and what else ?
""
""
Tissues 
""
""
Tissues of ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
Give me some 
prepare  ?

Teacher  in water gas

preparation
""
While these what you mention now were for gas 
""
""
down
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What are they  ?
""
What are they ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Active metals how do you know they are active metals  ?
""
Sameer ?
""
""
""
""
""
They react violently so  ?
""
""
They are active metals
""
""
""
""
""
Okay they react I know but how do you come to know they are
""
""
Yes Sheetal ?
""
""
From the activity series of metals
""
""
""
""
They are present at the  they are present at the
""
""
""
""
""
""
Top of the ?
""
""
""
""
""
So those metals which are at the top of series  in the
""
""
So  active metals like potassium sodium and calcium react with
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay  now explain the process of reaction of potassium
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How does potassium react 
""
""
""
""
""
Ajit  ?
""
""
""
Do you know the equation  ?
""
""
""
""

Hydrogen

""
Hydrogen 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Three uh
""
""
""
 reacting with water
""
""
""
""
""
One product isotope will be  hydrogen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Potassium hydroxide
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now tell me the process completely 
""
That is the whole process which you wrote in an  eq
""
""
Yes Hemant ?
""
""
It is not used
""
""
""
""
But if you add it to water it will show some reaction
""
""
""
""
""
""
Endothermic  ?
""
""
It is an endothermic 
""
""
What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic

""
What about endothermic  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Do you follow or no  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What happens to the heat that is evolved ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How does cold water react with sodium metal  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because its 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
One product is hydrogen because you are using it to prepare
hydrogen only 
""
""
sodium it will be 
calcium hydroxide 
""
""

Kiran  ?
""

Thats 
""
""
""
""

What does it do or what do you understand by amalgam or
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So you have to  mercury
""
""
to do  ?
""

Wrap it in a

Wrap it in a  okay
