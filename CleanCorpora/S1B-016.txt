What is the difference between H and H two ?
Difference between H and H two ?
Raise your hands if you know 
 name of student 
No he was sitting in the ninth standard 
Okay 
What is the difference between H and H two ?
Nobody ?
One is uh 
Yes yes
H is the one atom of hydrogen and H two is the one
molecule of hydrogen
Yes
That is this particular H stands for the atomic symbol of
hydrogen while H two is the formula or molecular formula of
 hygrogen noise 
What is it H stands for ?
 Atomic symbol while H two stands for
 the molecular formula 
 Atomic symbol 
 The molecular formula 
Okay what is the relative atomic mass of hydrogen ?
Relative atomic mass raise your hand
One point zero zero eight
One point zero zero eight 
 Eight 
Okay
Isotopes of hydrogen ?
Isotopes of hydrogen ?
No ?
Rahul ?
Molecules of hydrogen
Stand up and say 
Molecules noise of horn 
Kiran ?
 A few words 
 A few words 
Now when you put that one word one and one what does
this means ?
Which isotope is this indicate ?
 Noise 
What does this particular symbol indicate or this
representation indicate ?
Yes Savita ?
It is uh
It is ?
The one word 
 Noise 
So what will one H one stand for ?
 Procium 
 Procium okay
Now tell why do you guess or first tell me what is this
subscript stand for and the superscript stand for ? Noise 
Subscript stands for ?
Atomic number
Atomic number 
Nupur subscript stand for what ?
Mass number
Mass number
Mass number
Atomic number
Atomic number
So okay what does this particular subscript stand for ?
Mass number
Mass number 
Why are they written mass numbers here ?
Or what will show the formula one or two words 
 Because there is a difference there are different numbers
of neutrons 
Because there is difference in the number of 
neutrons 
 Neutrons 
And neutrons or mass number means ? Noise 
Mass number means ?
Number of protons
Number of 
Protons 
Number of protons plus number of neutrons 
 Neutrons 
Present in the
The nucleus of an atom
 The nucleus of an atom 
 The nucleus of an atom 
All right okay
Then next we go to about the occurance of hydrogen 
Hydrogen can occur in in which two states ?
Hydrogen can occur in which two states ?
Jivan ?
We get the atom in the free state
Give the example where where it is occuring in the free
state
In sun
In ?
Sun 
Sun and ? noise and ?
Atmosphere
Atmosphere of 
Earth
Earth and 
Sun 
Sun okay
Rakesh in the other state give me the examples ?
Rocks and minerals 
In the rocks and minerals
See so hydrogen occurs in two different states in the
free state and in the combined state
In the free state it is specially present in the atomsphere of
the sun and in the other stars of the universe
And in the combined state it can be present in the rocks and
minerals and what else ?
Tissues 
Tissues of ?
Animals and plants
Okay next is about the preparation of hydrogen 
Now you can prepare hydrogen by two words 
noise 
There are some general methods of preparation of hydrogen isn't it
 ?
Give me some names you can prepar 
prepare hydrogen from ?
Sejal
Cold water
From cold water okay 
Then ?
Boiling water
Boiling water and ?
Alkali noise 
Alkali 
Alkali any more ?
Any more ?
 That's all 
Teacher in water gas
From that is found after the industrial or
the commercial production 
 Industrial or the commercial production 
These all are mentioned here are the general methods of 
preparation
While these what you mention now were for gas 
This industrial process of preparation of hydrogen okay sit
down
Now give me one example for preparation of hydrogen from cold
water ?
Yes Sachin ?
Potassium calcium 
What are they ?
What are they ?
 Potassium calcium 
 Active metals 
They are ?
Active metals
Active metals how do you know they are active metals ?
Sameer ?
They react violently 
They react violently so ?
They are active metals
They react with uh cold water and produce uh 
Okay they react I know but how do you come to know they are
 active metals ?
Yes Sheetal ?
From the activity series of metals
From the activity series of metals 
They are present at the sit down they are present at the
 ?
Top 
Top of the ?
Series
So those metals which are at the top of series in the
active series are called as the active metals
So active metals like potassium sodium and calcium react with
 cold water to produce hydrogen 
 Hydrogen 
Okay now explain the process of reaction of potassium
with cold water ?
Replacement one word 
How does potassium react with cold water ?
 Noise 
How does potassium react ? student name 
How does potassium react with cold water ?
When potassium ash is added to cold water what happens ?
Ajit ?
No do not know how they react ?
Do you know the equation ?
Do you know the equation or no ?
The reactions ?
No
Potassium with water will give you what ?
 One word 
You are preparing what is that ?
What are you preparing ?
Hydrogen
So one product is going to be ?
Hydrogen 
K O 
Teacher 
Three uh
Okay so we were discussing about potassium
 reacting with water
 Potassium 
One product isotope will be hydrogen hydrogen
 Hydrogen 
So what will be the other product ?
K O H
K O H that is what ?
Potassium
Potassium hydroxide
Potassium hydroxide 
 Hydroxide 
Now tell me the process completely in detail 
That is the whole process which you wrote in an eq
 equation involved in it 
Yes Hemant ?
It is not used
I want the process it is not used I know 
But if you add it to water it will show some reaction
The the reaction will be violent and and and 
endo endothermic 
Endothermic ?
It is an endothermic Noise 
What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic
 ?
What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic ?
Teacher
Teacher teacher 
Come on come on hurry up 
In the endothermic it is revolved and in exothermic it is
evolved
No noise 
Anybody else ?
Exothermic is reactions in which heat is evolved 
Exothermic
Alright that was right
What about endothermic ?
No heat is evolved ?
Heat is
Heat is absorbed 
Do you follow or no ?
So when potassium reacts with water what happens ?
It reacts violently and it is an exothermic reaction
What else any other point left ?
Any other point left ?
What happens to the heat that is evolved ?
Ignites 
It
Ignites the hydrogen gas
Yes it ignites the hydrogen gas that is formed 
Next is what happens with sodium ?
How does cold water react with sodium metal ?
Tanuja ? Noise 
Hurry up 
Reaction with sodium is evolved uh with
More thing is 
And it reacts with one word and sod 
 sodiumness forming slowly reacts with the 
probably revolved above the water
Ah and when it revolves in water what happens ?
It noise 
To obtain the noise 
I am not asking that when it is revolving in water what
happens ?
Why is it revolving in water ?
Because its 
Reacting with water to give you hydrogen
 hydrogen gas and 
 Hydrogen 
 A few words 
In sodium hydroxide noise 
The active metals like potassium sodium calcium react 
One product is hydrogen because you are using it to prepare
hydrogen only and the other is always the product found in hydroxide 
If it is potassium it will be potassium hydroxide if it is
sodium it will be sodium hydroxide if it is uh calcium it will be 
calcium hydroxide 
Alright sit down
Now if you want to obtain a steady flow of hydrogen gas
 from while preparing it from sodium metal what do you have to do to
obtain a steady flow from the gas ?
Of the gas ?
Kiran ?
Sodium metal is amalgamated 
Is amalgamated means what is it done ?
Amalgamated what is the meaning of the term amalgamated ?
Thats one word 
No that is the different term totally noise
What does it do or what do you understand by amalgam or
amalgamated ?
Its an alloy
Miss an alloy of metal with mercury
Yes it is an alloy of a metal with mercury
So you have to amalgamate sodium with mercury
And what else do what else do you have
to do ?
That is the only thing you have to do teacher to
obtain the steady flow of the gas 
Savita ?
 Teacher 
Wrap it in a wire box 
Wrap it in a wire box okay
So you what will happen then you will get a steady flow
of the hydrogen gas that is evolved 
Then next we go to calcium 
How does water reacts with calcium ?
I already gave you the answer before itself 
How does calcium react with water ?
If you have listened to me carefully you will know what it is 
 One word 
The first thing we said about potassium 
We said what ?
The reaction is one word violent 
rigorous and exotherm 
 One word 
After that we place sodium because it is less vigorous than
 potassium okay
And thirdly now we have to come at calcium 
So now it will be ?
Hydrogen potassium and sodium
Draw back to both sodium and potassium 
 Potassium 
Alright now what is it left ?
Or why cannot we use calcium in ?
 Noise 
Why cannot we use calcium 
Why can't we use calcium in the production of hydrogen ?
Hydrogen 
Why cannot we use calcium in the production of hydrogen ?
Minaz 
Because it is an expensive method
Because it is an expensive method 
 Method 
Okay now how do we collect the hydrogen that is formed in
all these above cases ?
By downward method
How do we collect the hydrogen gas that is formed ?
Rakesh ?
By downward downward displacement
of
By downward displacement of water 
Aftab tell me why do you have to collect it by downward
displacement of water only ?
 A few words 
Why do we collect with by downward displacement of water 
what is the reason ?
Because it is slightly soluble in water
Slightly soluble in slightly soluble in a
Slightly soluble in water
Slightly soluble in water and what else ?
What is the other reasons ?
And lighter than air 
And lighter than air 
 Air 
So you collect it by the downward displacement of 
water 
 Water 
Then next is about preparation of hydrogen from boiling
water
Which metals react with boiling water to give you hydrogen ?
 noise 
Amit which metals react with boiling water to give you
hydrogen ?
 A few words 
No it's not so
Magnesium
Magnesium only magnesium zinc 
Iron iron 
Zinc and there is one more metal 
Iron 
Iron 
Iron okay 
So magnesium reacts with ?
 One word 
So these magnesium zinc and iron are ?
Less active metals
Less active metals than potassium sodium and calcium 
They react with water now a bit differently than
 what uh than how the sodium potossium and calcium were
reacting
What is the difference ?
None ?
The intention is to prepare hydrogen only or to be burnt
hydrogen when the reactor is boiling water 
But what is the difference between the other two process the
other one word 
Are you following the question or no ?
No
Both these metal or all these metals these three metals
 the active metals potassium calcium and sodium are reacting with
water to give you hydrogen and something else what is that ?
The hydroxide of those metals right
Here these metals magnesium zinc and iron which are less
active than potassiun sodium and calcium are reacting with water to give
you hydrogen but they are giving you some other product what is that ?
