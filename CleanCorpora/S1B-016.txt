What is  ?
""
Difference between H and H  ?
""
Raise your hands if you know 
""
""
""
""
No he was sitting in the ninth standard 
""
Okay 
""
""
What is the difference between H and H  ?
""
Nobody  ?
""
""
One is uh 
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
H is the one atom of hydrogen and H  is the one
molecule of hydrogen
""
""
Yes
""
That is this particular H stands for the  of
hydrogen  formula or molecular formula of
""
""
What is it  H stands for ?
""
""
 stands for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay what is  ?
""
Relative atomic mass raise your hand
""
""
One point zero zero eight
""
""
One point zero zero 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay
""
Isotopes of hydrogen  ?
""
Isotopes of hydrogen  ?
""
No  ?
""
Rahul  ?
""
""
Molecules of hydrogen
""
""
Stand up and say 
""
""
Molecules 
""
""
Kiran  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now when you put that  one and one what does
this means  ?
""
Which isotope is this indicate  ?
""
""
""
""
""
What does this particular symbol indicate or this
representation indicate  ?
""
Yes Savita ?
""
""
It is uh
""
""
It is  ?
""
""
The 
""
""
""
""
""
So what will one H one stand for  ?
""
""
""
""
""
 okay
""
Now tell why do you guess or first tell me  what is this
subscript stand for and the superscript stand for 
""
Subscript stands for  ?
""
""
Atomic number
""
""
Atomic 
""
Nupur  subscript stand for what ?
""
""
Mass number
""
""
Mass number
""
""
Mass number
""
""
Atomic number
""
""
Atomic number
""
So  okay what does this particular subscript stand for ?
""
""
Mass number
""
""
Mass number 
""
Why are they written mass numbers here  ?
""
Or what will show 
""
""
""
 Because there is a difference there are different numbers
of neutrons 
""
""
Because there is difference in the number of 
neutrons 
""
""
""
""
""
And neutrons or mass number means 
""
Mass number means  ?
""
""
Number of protons
""
""
Number of 
""
""
Protons 
""
""
Number of protons plus number of 
""
""
""
""
""
Present in the
""
""
The nucleus of an atom
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All right  okay
""
Then next we go to about the occurance of hydrogen 
""
Hydrogen can occur in  ?
""
Hydrogen can occur in which two states  ?
""
Jivan ?
""
""
We get the atom in the free state
""
""
Give the example where  where it is occuring in the free
state
""
""
In sun
""
""
In  ?
""
""
Sun 
""
""
Sun and  ?
""
""
Atmosphere
""
""
Atmosphere of 
""
""
Earth
""
""
Earth and 
""
""
Sun 
""
""
Sun okay
""
Rakesh  in the other state give me the examples ?
""
""
Rocks and minerals 
""
""
In the rocks and  minerals
""
See  two different states in the
free state and in the  combined state
""
In the  free state it is specially present in the atomsphere of
the  universe
""
And in the combined state it can be present in the  rocks and
minerals and what else ?
""
""
Tissues 
""
""
Tissues of ?
""
""
Animals and plants
""
""
Okay next is 
""
Now you can prepare hydrogen 
noise 
""
There are some general methods of preparation of hydrogen isn't it
 ?
""
Give me some 
prepare  ?
""
Sejal
""
""
Cold water
""
""
From cold water okay 
""
Then ?
""
""
Boiling water
""
""
Boiling water  and ?
""
""
Alkali 
""
""
Alkali 
""
""
Alkali  ?
""
Any more  ?
""
""
""
""
Teacher  in water gas
""
""
From  industrial or
the commercial production 
""
""
""
""
""
These all are mentioned here are the general methods of 
preparation
""
While these what you mention now were for gas 
""
This industrial process of preparation of hydrogen  okay sit
down
""
Now give me one example  for preparation of hydrogen from cold
water  ?
""
Yes Sachin ?
""
""
Potassium calcium 
""
""
What are they  ?
""
What are they ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They are ?
""
""
Active metals
""
""
Active metals how do you know they are active metals  ?
""
Sameer ?
""
""
They react violently 
""
""
They react violently so  ?
""
""
They are active metals
""
""
They react with 
""
""
Okay they react I know but how do you come to know they are
 ?
""
Yes Sheetal ?
""
""
From the activity series of metals
""
""
From the activity series of 
""
They are present at the  they are present at the
 ?
""
""
Top 
""
""
Top of the ?
""
""
Series
""
""
So those metals which are at the top of series  in the
active series are called as the active metals
""
So  active metals like potassium sodium and calcium react with
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay  now explain the process of reaction of potassium
with cold water  ?
""
""
Replacement 
""
""
How does potassium react with  ?
""
""
""
How does potassium react 
""
How does potassium react with cold water  ?
""
When potassium ash is added to cold water what happens  ?
""
Ajit  ?
""
No  do not know how they react ?
""
Do you know the equation  ?
""
Do you know the equation or no  ?
""
The reactions  ?
""
""
No
""
""
Potassium  ?
""
""
""
""
""
You are preparing what is that  ?
""
What are you preparing  ?
""
Hydrogen
""
So one product is going to be  ?
""
Hydrogen 
""
K O 
""
""
Teacher 
""
""
Three uh
""
""
Okay so  potassium
 reacting with water
""
""
""
""
""
One product isotope will be  hydrogen
""
""
""
""
""
So what will be the other product ?
""
""
K O H
""
""
K O H that is what  ?
""
""
Potassium
""
""
Potassium hydroxide
""
""
Potassium 
""
""
""
""
""
Now tell me the process completely 
""
That is the whole process which you wrote in an  eq
""
""
Yes Hemant ?
""
""
It is not used
""
""
I want the process 
""
But if you add it to water it will show some reaction
""
""
The the reaction will be violent and and 
endo 
""
""
Endothermic  ?
""
""
It is an endothermic 
""
""
What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic
 ?
""
What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic  ?
""
""
Teacher
""
""
Teacher teacher 
""
""
Come on come on hurry up 
""
""
In the endothermic it is revolved and in exothermic it is
evolved
""
""
No 
""
Anybody else  ?
""
Exothermic 
""
""
Exothermic
""
""
Alright that was right
""
What about endothermic  ?
""
No heat is evolved  ?
""
""
Heat is
""
""
Heat is absorbed 
""
Do you follow or no  ?
""
So when potassium reacts with water what happens  ?
""
It  reaction
""
""
What else any other point left  ?
""
Any other point  ?
""
What happens to the heat that is evolved ?
""
""
Ignites 
""
""
It
""
""
Ignites the hydrogen gas
""
""
Yes it ignites the hydrogen gas that is 
""
Next is what happens with sodium  ?
""
How does cold water react with sodium metal  ?
""
Tanuja 
""
Hurry up 
""
""
Reaction with sodium is evolved uh with
""
""
More thing is 
""
""
And it reacts with 
""
probably  revolved above the water
""
""
Ah and when it revolves in water  ?
""
It 
""
""
To obtain the 
""
""
I am not asking that  when it is revolving in water what
happens  ?
""
Why is it revolving in water  ?
""
""
Because its 
""
""
Reacting with water  hydrogen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In sodium hydroxide 
""
The active metals like potassium sodium calcium react 
""
One product is hydrogen because you are using it to prepare
hydrogen only 
""
If it is potassium it will be potassium hydroxide  if it is
sodium it will be 
calcium hydroxide 
""
Alright sit down
""
Now  hydrogen gas
 to
obtain a steady flow from the gas  ?
""
Of the gas  ?
""
Kiran  ?
""
""
Sodium metal is amalgamated 
""
""
Is amalgamated means what is it done  ?
""
Amalgamated  what is the meaning of the term amalgamated ?
""
""
Thats 
""
""
No  noise
""
""
What does it do or what do you understand by amalgam or
amalgamated  ?
""
""
Its an alloy
""
""
Miss an alloy of metal with mercury
""
""
Yes it is an alloy of a metal with  mercury
""
So you have to  mercury
""
And  you have
to do  ?
""
That is the only thing you have to do  to
obtain the steady flow of the gas 
""
Savita  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Wrap it in a 
""
""
Wrap it in a  okay
""
So  what will happen then you will get a steady flow
of the 
""
Then next we go to 
""
How does  water reacts with calcium ?
""
I already gave you the answer before itself 
""
How does calcium react with water  ?
""
If you have listened to me carefully you will know what it is 
""
""
""
""
""
The first thing we said about potassium 
""
We said what  ?
""
The reaction is 
rigorous and 
""
""
""
""
""
After that we place sodium because it is less vigorous than
 okay
""
And thirdly now we have to come at calcium 
""
So now it will be ?
""
""
Hydrogen potassium and sodium
""
""
Draw back to both sodium and 
""
""
""
""
""
Alright  ?
""
Or why cannot we use calcium  in ?
""
""
""
""
""
Why cannot we use 
""
""
Why can't we use calcium in the production of hydrogen  ?
""
""
Hydrogen 
""
""
Why cannot we use calcium in the production of hydrogen  ?
Minaz 
""
""
Because it is an expensive method
""
""
Because it is an expensive 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay  now how do we collect the hydrogen that is formed in
all these above cases ?
""
""
By downward method
""
""
How do we collect the hydrogen gas that is formed  ?
""
Rakesh  ?
""
""
By  displacement
of
""
""
By downward displacement of 
""
Aftab tell me why do you have to  collect it by downward
displacement of water only  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Why do we collect with by downward displacement of water 
what is the reason  ?
""
""
Because it is slightly  soluble in water
""
""
Slightly  slightly soluble in a
""
""
Slightly soluble in water
""
""
Slightly  ?
""
What is the other reasons  ?
""
""
And lighter than air 
""
""
And lighter than 
""
""
""
""
""
So you collect it by the downward displacement of 
water 
""
""
""
""
""
Then next is about  preparation of hydrogen from boiling
water
""
Which metals react with boiling water to give you hydrogen  ?
""
""
Amit  which metals react with boiling water to give you
hydrogen  ?
""
""
""
""
""
No  not so
""
""
Magnesium
""
""
Magnesium 
""
""
Iron iron 
""
""
Zinc and 
""
""
Iron 
""
""
Iron 
""
""
Iron 
""
So magnesium reacts with  ?
""
""
""
""
""
So these magnesium  ?
""
""
Less active metals
""
""
Less active metals than potassium sodium and calcium 
""
They react with water now  than
 the sodium potossium and calcium were
reacting
""
What is the difference  ?
""
None  ?
""
The intention is to prepare hydrogen only  or to be burnt
hydrogen when the reactor is boiling water 
""
But what is the difference between the other two process  the
other 
""
Are you following the question or no  ?
""
""
No
""
""
Both these metal or all these metals  these three metals
 sodium are reacting with
water to give you hydrogen and something else what is that  ?
""
The hydroxide of those metals  right
""
Here  magnesium zinc and iron which are less
active than  potassiun sodium and calcium are reacting with water to give
you hydrogen but  ?
""
