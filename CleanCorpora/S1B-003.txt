""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The upper portion 
""
""
""
Ventricles 
""
""
""
are  whereas the
ventricles are very muscular 
""
Each side of the  auricles and ventricles they are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now these  which
""
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
diagram you can see 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Similarly the right auricle  is again
""
""
""
These valves are very strong and made up of  muscular tissues
 ventricular side
""
""
collisentinel 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
aperture is guarded by bicuspid valve  right side of the
""
""
""
The two auricles act as a  which
""
of the 
""
""
""
""
ventricle when it contracts it 
""
This is the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
From the  it goes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

In this diagram 
""

Which is that  ?
""
That day I have told you about it 
""
""
Pulmonary 
""
""
Pulmonary vein 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the 
""
But these carry  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now which are these two  ?
""
Which is here  superior and inferior venacava
""
end 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
De-oxygenated 
""
""
""
""
""
These two aortas open into the right auricle 
""
Then when the auricle contracts 
ventricle 
""
Then from ventricle when it ventricle contract  the blood goes
""
""
From right auricle  BB-Work
""
""
""
Pulmonary vein  pulmonary artery
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Which  lungs for purification
""
""
""
blood from the lungs 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
they contract  at at
""
""
""
I have just explained you 
""
""
""
Both the ventricles 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Auricles first 
""
How many times this contraction takes place  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Can you measure it  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Miss what is the meaning of electrocardio 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That function of E T P radiocardiam 
""
""
""
""
""
count these lub and dub sound 
""
Lub and dub sound 
""
""
""
""
""
""
can 
""
""

""
""
Pulse yes 
""
""
I 
""

""
Here it is  thumb side
""
""
""
""
Now the  one more is
""
BB-Work 
""
What do you mean by the portal  vein ?
""
Why not it is simple vein  ?
""
Portal vein  ?
""
Because this vein  but
it goes through 
""
There it gets filtered on the  amonic
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
BB-Work  that is nitrogeneous material
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So in this way  and different
""
""
""
""
""
It will come to which auricle  ?
