 BB-Work 
So the last time we had studied the external structure of heart
Mammalian heart 
Today we are going to study about internal internal
structure BB-Work 
 Internal 
As you know that the mammalian heart it is four
chambered BB-Work 
Can any one tell me which which are these chambers 
are ?
Auricles and ventricles 
Yes very correct 
Two auricles
Two auricles BB-Work two auricles and two
ventricles 
Which chambers are called as auricles ?
Say clearly 
The upper portion 
Which are the auricles ?
Upper portions are auricles
Yes very correct 
The upper portion the upper chambers are auricles 
 BB-Work and the lower ones are ventricles
Ventricles 
In the same way these auricles auricles are usually 
are very thin wall structures BB-Work whereas the
ventricles are very muscular 
Each side of the auricles and ventricles they are
interconnected the left side and the right side 
Now they are interconnected by an aperture common aperture 
which are known as auricular-ventricular aperture BB-Work 
It is internal effecting through auricles
No auricles auricles and ventricles
 noise 
 Auricles 
 Auricles and ventricles 
Now these auricles are guarded by valves which
 prevent prevents the blood flowing again
 on the same side or going back into the ventricles or auricles
Or you can say that that it prevents
the back flow of the blood 
The left side auricular-ventricular aperture here in this
diagram you can see 
It is guarded by a valve which is known as bicuspid valve
Bicuspid BB-Work bicuspid valve or you can 
call it as a mitral valve also BB-Work 
What is it function what
To prevent the back flow of the blood from auricles to
ventricles 
Similarly the right auricle and the ventricle is again
guarded by a valve which is known as tricuspid valve tricuspid
valve BB-Work 
These valves are very strong and made up of muscular tissues
 which open into the of course of ventricular side
 and to keep it there keep the flap as it is it is
 held up by some tissue chords which are known as 
collisentinel collisentinel BB-Work 
So this is the internal structure
Now how does working of the heart takes place ?
By left and right ventricle aperture they may be 
Left side takes the bicuspid and right side the tricuspid
Auriculars 
Auricular-ventricular aperture 
Left side this side entering
That means that left side auricular-ventricular 
aperture is guarded by bicuspid valve and the right side of the
auricular-ventricular aperture is guarded by tricuspid valve BB-Work
The two auricles act as a reservoir of the blood which
 collected from the side of the all sides
of the body 
It comes and get stored in the auricles 
From auricles then it goes to the ventricles and then
ventricle when it contracts it gets closed into the vessels 
This is the general working of the heart 
BB-Work 
Auricles when the auricles contract the blood flows
into the ventricles and when the ventricles contract the blood flows
into the vessels 
Which are these vessels can any one tell me ?
 BB-Work 
From the le left side from the left it goes
to the pulmonary pulmonary vessels BB-Work 
What do you mean by pulmonary ?
Going towards lungs BB-Work 
Then what about systematic arteries ?
 BB-Work 
Systematic artery are the main vessels which supply blood
to the body organs different body organs 
Now these vessels also as it opens into the ventricles of
their own side in the vessel itself it also contains or it also based on
that which are known as cellulilar glands BB-Work 
In this diagram here see this is the in 
systematic this is pulmanory and this is described here 
Now the blood which comes to the right auricle it
comes from different parts of the body
That means it should be definitely veinal blood 
What do you mean by vienal blood ? BB-Work 
Into the 
De- oxygenated de-oxygenated 
BB-Work 
 Oxygenated 
This is a degenated 
Pardon me 
Degenated 
De 
Genate 
De-oxygenated blood because it will go for purification to
the lungs 
Except one vein which brings purified blood
Which is that ?
That day I have told you about it 
Pulmonary 
Pulmonary vein 
Though it is called as vein but it brings oxygenated blood
 because the direction of flow is towards the heart 
But it carries oxygenated blood 
In the same way the pulmonary artery which is going away from
the heart that other aor this aorta 
But these carry veinal blood why ?
Or these carry de-oxygenated blood 
Why ?
Can you tell me ?
Then why the name has been given as aor aorta ?
Only because the direction of flow is towards the body organs
Away from the heart 
Now which are these two veinal blood systems are ?
Which is here this blue one superior and inferior venacava
 BB-Work begins superior inferior venacava BB-Work
end 
The superior venacava brings de-oxygenated blood from the
 upper portion or head region of the body BB-Work 
Head ante anterior against these 
De-oxygenated 
And inferior means from the lower portion of the body
 BB-Work 
These two aortas open into the right auricle 
Then when the auricle contracts it goes to the right 
ventricle 
Then from ventricle when it ventricle contract the blood goes
 into the vessel 
From right auricle which vessel it will go ? BB-Work
Pulmonary vein pulmonary artery
Pulmonary 
Artery
Artery yes 
Which will take the blood to the lungs for purification
In the same way left auricle receives blood purified
blood from the lungs 
As it contracts the left auricle oxygenated blood
then goes to the left ventricle 
And the ventricle after contraction it takes blood
through the vessels to to the different parts of the body 
or main systematic arteries BB-Work 
But aorta and uh sorry uh auricles and the ventricles 
they contract together or the auricles they will contract at at
the time 
So the working of left and the right auricle will be going as
I have just explained you 
Ventricles also contract at the same time 
Both the ventricles 
 And the working 
 And they are undertaking 
No no two two together 
Auricles first then ventricles 
How many times this contraction takes place ?
Seventy two uh 
 Seventy-two uh good 
 Seventy-two times 
Seventy-two times 
Can you measure it ?
Know there is some instrument 
Electrocard iogram 
Stethescope BB-Work which helps in 
Miss what is the meaning of electrocardio gram 
 Counting the sounds of this contraction
Miss what is the main function of electrocardiam 
That spinal 
That function of E T P radiocardiam 
That is electron 
How to count these in the first medical you have to first
count these lub and dub sound BB-Work 
Lub and dub sound 
Lub 
And if you want to count it by your finger tips you
can 
There is pulse rate 
Pulse yes pulse rate you can just near the thumb 
I mean the pulse is 
No no I mean
 Left hand 
Here it is this count near the thumb thumb side
portion this is BB-Work 
Now there are two types of these veins also
Now the ephatic portal vein and the one more is
there portal vein renal portal ephatic portal 
BB-Work 
What do you mean by the portal vein ?
Why not it is simple vein ?
Portal vein ?
Because this vein is not directly going to the heart but
it goes through some one of the organs 
There it gets filtered on the nitrogenous amonic
material and from there then the simple way to go to the heart 
from heart then it goes to the lungs for purification 
So there are two portal veins hepatic portal vein and
the renal-portal vein 
 Hepatic portal vein goes to the liver 
BB-Work liver for filtration that is nitrogeneous material
And renal- portal the filtration takes place in kidney
 for amonic material 
Again that would be the procedure only 
So in this way there are two portal veins and different
types of veins in the body which help in collecting the different 
veinal blood and then getting stored in the auricle 
Which auricle ?
It will come to which auricle ?
Main vein 
Right auricle
Right auricle correct

correct 
 Experiment 
Then just I will read the lesson loudly Teacher
starts reading 
 P C Ray 
The neighbours did not know what to make of the young man 
That he was a college lecturer and scientist they knew 
And he did experiments in small laboratory he had set up at his
house 
But what scientific purpose could he hope to serve by dumping on
terrace sackfuls of cattle bones he had got from the local butcher 
They had put up with the odours that had often been wafted to them
by breeze from his laboratory 
But the stench from rotting bone and flesh was unbearable 
Crows had also been littering houses all around with bones picked
up from te terrace 
After several days of this they could stand it no longer 
They told the young man to take away the bones 
If he did not they would call the muncipal authorities 
At this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 
He had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house 
end of reading 
 Yeah 
 Starts reading 
At this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 
He had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house and the
 bones could be dumped there 
That was done and one evening when he found that the bones had
been well dried by the sun the young man made a bonfire of them 
There was trouble again 
Policemen attracted by the fire arrived and he had a hard time
convincing them that he was no murderer destroying evidence and
that it was not human bones that were being burnt 
The next morning he took the ashes of the bones to his laboratory
and treated with them sulphuric acid 
When the superphosphate of lime thus produced was mixed with soda
 a solution of phosphate of soda was formed 
The solution was then put into large basin and boiled 
This produced lumps of phosphate of soda crystals 
The young man took a lump and chewed it 
He smiled happily 
He had converted the waste cattle bones into a medicinal compound
from which nerve tonic could be made 
The young man began to produce the tonic on a large scale 
It was cheaper than the imported product available in the market
and was as effective 
In the beginning druggist were not ready to keep this desi
 medicine but doctors who knew the young man and the
effectiveness of the tonic canvassed it and it became popular 
This was the modest beginning of the Bengal Chemical and
Pharmaceutical Works now one of the biggest chemical firms in the country
 and the young man was Prafulla Chandra Ray
Today Ray is recognised as the father of India's chemical
industry 
And he not only developed centres of research in chemistry and
trained brilliant young chemists but also by original research placed
India in high position in the world of chemistry end of reading 
Now read the lesson silently for three to four minutes
