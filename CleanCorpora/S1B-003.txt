So the last time we had studied  the external structure of heart
""
""
Mammalian heart 
""
Today we are going to study about  internal
structure 
""
""
""
""
""
As you know that  four
chambered 
""
Can any one tell me 
are  ?
""
""
Auricles and ventricles 
""
""
Yes very correct 
""
""
Two auricles
""
""
Two auricles  and two
ventricles 
""
Which chambers are called as auricles  ?
""
Say clearly 
""
""
The upper portion 
""
""
Which are the auricles ?
""
""
Upper portions are auricles
""
""
Yes 
""
The upper portion 
 ventricles
""
""
Ventricles 
""
""
In the same way these auricles 
are  whereas the
ventricles are very muscular 
""
Each side of the  auricles and ventricles they are
interconnected 
""
Now they are interconnected by 
which are known as 
""
""
It is internal  effecting through auricles
""
""
No  auricles and ventricles
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now these  which
 flowing again
 into the ventricles or auricles
""
""
Or you can say  it prevents
the 
""
The left side  auricular-ventricular aperture here in this
diagram you can see 
""
It is  a valve which is known as bicuspid valve
""
""
Bicuspid 
call it as a mitral valve also 
""
""
What is it function  what
""
""
To prevent the back flow of the blood  from auricles to
ventricles 
""
Similarly the right auricle  is again
guarded by  tricuspid
valve 
""
These valves are very strong and made up of  muscular tissues
 ventricular side
 it is
""
collisentinel 
""
So this is the internal structure
""
Now how does  ?
""
""
By left and right ventricle aperture they may be 
""
""
Left side takes the bicuspid  and right side the tricuspid
""
""
""
Auriculars 
""
""
Auricular-ventricular aperture 
""
""
Left side  this side entering
""
""
That means that 
aperture is guarded by bicuspid valve  right side of the
auricular-ventricular aperture is guarded by tricuspid valve  BB-Work
""
""
The two auricles act as a  which
 all sides
of the 
""
It comes and get 
""
From auricles then  and then
ventricle when it contracts it 
""
This is the 
BB-Work 
""
Auricles  the blood flows
into the  and when the ventricles contract the blood flows
into the 
""
Which are these vessels can any one tell me  ?
""
""
""
From the  it goes
to the 
""
What do you mean by pulmonary  ?
""
Going towards 
""
Then what about systematic  ?
""
""
""
Systematic artery are the main  supply blood
to the 
""
Now these vessels also  of
their own side  in the vessel itself it also contains or it also based on
that 
""
In this diagram 
systematic 
""
Now the blood  it
comes from  different parts of the body
""
That means it should be 
""
What do you mean by vienal blood 
""
""
Into the 
""
""
De- 
BB-Work 
""
""
""
""
""
This is a degenated 
""
""
Pardon me 
""
""
Degenated 
""
""
De 
""
""
Genate 
""
""
De-oxygenated blood  because it will go for purification to
the 
""
Except one  purified blood
""
Which is that  ?
""
That day I have told you about it 
""
""
Pulmonary 
""
""
Pulmonary vein 
""
Though it is called as vein but it brings  oxygenated blood
""
""
But it carries 
""
In the same way the pulmonary artery  which is going away from
the 
""
But these carry  ?
""
Or these carry 
""
Why  ?
""
Can you tell me  ?
""
Then why the name has been given as  ?
""
Only because the direction of flow is towards the  body organs
""
""
Away from the heart 
""
Now which are these two  ?
""
Which is here  superior and inferior venacava
 BB-Work
end 
""
The superior venacava  from the
""
""
Head 
""
""
De-oxygenated 
""
""
And inferior means  lower portion of the body
""
""
These two aortas open into the right auricle 
""
Then when the auricle contracts 
ventricle 
""
Then from ventricle when it ventricle contract  the blood goes
""
""
From right auricle  BB-Work
""
""
""
Pulmonary vein  pulmonary artery
""
""
Pulmonary 
""
""
Artery
""
""
Artery yes 
""
Which  lungs for purification
""
""
In the same way  purified
blood from the lungs 
""
As it contracts  oxygenated blood
then goes to the left 
""
And the ventricle  takes blood
through the vessels 
or 
""
But aorta and uh 
they contract  at at
the time 
""
So the working of left and the right auricle will be going  as
I have just explained you 
""
Ventricles also contract 
""
Both the ventricles 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No no two 
""
Auricles first 
""
How many times this contraction takes place  ?
""
""
Seventy two uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Seventy-two times 
""
Can you measure it  ?
""
Know there is some instrument 
""
""
Electrocard 
""
""
Stethescope 
""
""
Miss what is the meaning of electrocardio 
""
""
 of this contraction
""
""
Miss what is the main function of electrocardiam 
""
""
That 
""
""
That function of E T P radiocardiam 
""
""
That is electron 
""
How to count these in the  you have to first
count these lub and dub sound 
""
Lub and dub sound 
""
""
Lub 
""
""
And if you want to  you
can 
""
""
There is pulse rate 
""
""
Pulse yes 
""
""
I 
""
No no I mean
""
""
""
""
""
Here it is  thumb side
portion 
""
Now there are two types of these  also
""
Now the  one more is
there portal vein 
BB-Work 
""
What do you mean by the portal  vein ?
""
Why not it is simple vein  ?
""
Portal vein  ?
""
Because this vein  but
it goes through 
""
There it gets filtered on the  amonic
material 
from heart then it goes to the lungs for purification 
""
So there are two portal veins  portal vein and
the 
""
""
BB-Work  that is nitrogeneous material
""
""
And renal- portal  kidney
""
""
Again that would be the procedure only 
""
So in this way  and different
types of veins in the body which help in collecting the 
veinal blood 
""
Which auricle  ?
""
It will come to which auricle  ?
""
""
Main vein 
""
Right auricle
""
""
Right auricle correct 
""
""
""

Page number sixty-eight 
scientist acid gas burner and flask
""
You have already told the those names here 
""
Now 
""
What is this a picture of  ?
""
""
""
""
""
P C Ray 
""
""
P C Ray because they have already mentioned there
""
Name is given there P C Ray 
""
Now what is the scientist doing there ?
""
""
Experiment 
""
""
Not in all
""
Only group wise 
""
The scientist is doing  experiment
correct 
""
""
""
""
""
Then just  Teacher
starts reading 
""
""
""
The neighbours did not know what to make of the young man 
""
That he was a college lecturer and scientist 
""
And he did experiments in small laboratory he had set up at his
house 
""
But what scientific purpose could he hope to serve by dumping on
terrace 
""
They had put up with the odours that had often been wafted to them
by breeze from his laboratory 
""
But the stench from rotting bone and flesh was unbearable 
""
Crows had also been littering houses all around with bones picked
up from 
""
After several days of this 
""
They told the young man 
""
If he did not they would call the muncipal authorities 
""
At this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 
""
He had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house 
end of reading 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
At this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 
""
He had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house and the
""
""
That was done and one evening  when he found that the bones had
been well dried by the sun 
""
There was trouble again 
""
Policemen attracted by the fire  arrived and he had a hard time
convincing them that he was no  and
that it was not human bones that were being burnt 
""
The next morning he took the ashes of the bones to his laboratory
and treated with them 
""
When the superphosphate of lime thus produced was mixed with soda
""
""
The solution was then put into large basin and boiled 
""
This produced lumps of phosphate of soda crystals 
""
The young man took a lump and chewed it 
""
He smiled happily 
""
He had converted the waste cattle bones into a medicinal compound
from which nerve tonic could be made 
""
The young man began to produce the tonic on a large scale 
""
It was cheaper than the imported product available in the market
and was 
""
In the beginning druggist were not ready to keep this  desi
 young man and the
effectiveness of the tonic canvassed it and it became 
""
This was the modest beginning of the Bengal Chemical and
Pharmaceutical Works  now one of the biggest chemical firms in the country
 and the young man was Prafulla Chandra Ray
""
Today Ray is recognised as the father of  chemical
industry 
""
And he not only developed centres of research in chemistry and
trained brilliant young chemists  placed
India in high position in the world of chemistry 
""
Now read the lesson  for three to four minutes
