Uhm uhm
But uh some of the RPs that they have trained does not
 uh of of your calibre they does not 
not all of them are one of them 
 Such conditions have happened by and large
But most of them are good 
Any thing is there produced uh materials which uh do
not require much uh resource personnel 
Uhm uhm

country 
So those differences are bound to be there 
Now I wonder how many people from the north east also were trained
Uhm
There are there are many from west side 
There are many from west side
Dominantly south and north
Why was it may be people didn't apply or uh
No they applied uhm mainly they didn't
qualify

Oh I see accha otherwise
they chose again 
 They conducted because of conducted 
Ha ha
That they didn't have time and the number of applications
were of course I
 Accha so you mean to say eh they didn't
short list people for interviews
