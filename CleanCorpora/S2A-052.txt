It is commonly believed that the only way to cook kabab
 is in a tandoor or on a grill 
Nothing could be farther from the truth 
There are several ways to cook kabab and there
are many kabab which can be cooked in several ways 
To cite an example the tikka of kid or lamb can
be roasted in the tandoor cooked on a grilled 
shallow fried on a girdle or in the Rajastani style cooked in a 
hundi or pot 
There is another fine example where tikka or fish
 or can be grilled in the tandoor or as in the case
of uh Amritsari machali deep fried in a kadhai
 which is a one word of worth 
Moreover let me assure you that kabab cooked on
grills with those and in kadhai are as popular as those
roasted in the tandoor 
Yet it is the tandoori kabab especially 
tandoori chicken which helped Indian cuisine build its
international reputation 
Based upon the success Indian masters not only gave a
gastronomic accent to the rustic kabab but created
delicacies so sublime and subtle that they expand best selling
restaurants which made curry places curry houses look ordinary in
comparison
At least as far as the bottom line was concerned
