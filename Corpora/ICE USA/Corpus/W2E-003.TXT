<ICE-USA:W2E-003#1:1> <h> Here Come the Eager Beavers</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#2:1> Liberals, thinking government is a scalpel, are hot to operate on

the body politic George F. Will James Carville, Bill Clinton 's Clausewitz,

talks like an Uzi, in bursts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#3:1> He should do the president-elect a final favor by firing off for him

the story of the traffic lights on Florida Street in Baton Rouge, Louisiana

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#4:1> A decade ago, Carville helped elect as mayor of that city a man

who promised to synchronize the traffic lights on the main drag, Florida

Street.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#5:1> By God, said the candidate, using a rhetorical trope then fashionable,

if we can put a man on the moon, we can smooth out the herky-jerky

stop-and-start nonflow of traffic.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#6:1> So the new mayor straightaway turned to Carville and said: Get it

done.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#7:1> Carville called the city 's traffic engineer and said: Make it happen.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#8:1> The engineer said: OK.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#9:1> But it will cost bushels of money.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#10:1> The computers will have to be jiggered.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#11:1> And there will be these problems with left-turn lanes.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#12:1> And, besides .. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#13:1> The traffic on Florida Street still does not flow </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#14:1> But even if Carville tells this cautionary tale to Clinton and to

the swarms of eager beavers now bearing down on Washington it probably will

not do a lick of good.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#15:1> Washington had better brace itself for the arrival of a lot of

liberals who really believe that government is a sharp scalpel, and who can

hardly wait to operate on the body politic.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#16:1> Or, to change the metaphor, they are eager to go marching as to war

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#17:1> The Cold War is over, but the governmental hubris that the war

engendered lingers on.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#18:1> Liberals, who often have faulted U.S. foreign policy for its alleged

bellicosity, are enamored of 'wars' on the home front.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#19:1> Burton Yale Pines, a leading conservative, believes the Cold War gave

rise to a misplaced confidence in Washington 's capacity to do things not

related to the Cold War, but which were called 'wars' anyway.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#20:1> The powers Washington acquired to run containment of Communism seemed

to give Washington legitimacy as architect of ambitious domestic

undertakings.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#21:1> Washington declared 'wars' on poverty, crime, drugs and AIDS, spoke

of a " Marshall Plan" for the cities and a " Manhattan project" for

education.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#22:1> The language of war lent spurious plausibility to the idea that the

government 's skills in foreign policy could be as successfully applied to

solving the social problems of an individualistic, pluralistic society </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#23:1> Actually, the importation of martial language into domestic

governance began before the Cold War.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#24:1> Franklin Roosevelt, in his first Inaugural Address, said he might ask

Congress for " broad executive power to wage war against the emergency as

great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a

foreign foe."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#25:1> Eight months before that, FDR had told the Democratic convention that

the nation should resume the " interrupted march along the path of real

progress."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#26:1> The 12-year interruption had been the interval of Republican rule

between Woodrow Wilson - a war leader - and FDR, domestic 'commander in

chief' treating a domestic difficulty as the moral equivalent of war.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#27:1> Wilson, who disliked the Founding Fathers' purposes in designing the

separation of powers, was impatient with institutional inhibitions on

government 's freedom to alter the balance between " the power of the

government and the privileges of the individual."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#28:1> Before Clinton surrenders to the siren call of the Wilsonian

presidency, read Terry Eastland 's 'Energy in the Executive: The Case for a

Strong Presidency.' Eastland traces some problems of the modern presidency to

Wilsonian grandiosity in the conception of the president 's duties.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#29:1> Wilson, writes Eastland, was the first holder of the office to

believe " that Presidents are to lead the people ever onwards and upwards -

to an unknown destination only history can reveal, but which, as the decades

have passed, inevitably seems to have required larger and more costly

government whose reach extends more deeply into the states and the private

sector."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#30:1> <quote/> Wilson declared that <quote_> " the size of modern democracy

necessitates the exercise of persuasive power by dominant minds in the

shaping of popular judgments."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#31:1> Thus began the inflation of the presidential function: The president

as the public 's tutor, moral auditor and cheerleader </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#32:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#33:1> <h> " Salvation by society"</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#34:1> Clinton, who will be the sixth Democratic president since Woodrow

Wilson, leads a party still awash with Wilsonian liberalism 's desire to

conscript the individual into collective undertakings.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#35:1> Wilson presided over the 'war socialism' of modern mobilization.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#36:1> Walter Lippmann and other 'progressives' thought war could be a

healthy antidote to America 's excessive 'individualism' and " the evils of

localism."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#37:1> The public, properly led by a " dominant mind" at the pinnacle of the

executive branch of the central government, could be nationalized and

homogenized and made into good raw material for great undertakings.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#38:1> The greatest of these was to be what Peter Drucker calls " salvation

by society" - society, controlled by government, would perfect individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#39:1> Hence, Lyndon Johnson.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#40:1> One of his aides, Harry McPherson, described how LBJ envisioned the

nation as a patient whose pathologies were to receive presidential

ministrations: " People were [ seen to be] suffering from a sense of

alienation from one another, of anomie, of powerlessness.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#41:1> This affected the well-to-do as much as it did the poor.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#42:1> Middle-class women, bored and friendless in the suburban afternoons;

fathers, working at 'meaningless' j 'ms, or slumped before the television set;

sons and daughters desperate for 'relevance' 'rell were in need of community,

beauty, and purpose, all were guilty because so many others were deprived

while they, rich beyond their ancestors' dreams, were depressed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#43:1> What would change all this was a creative public effort ..."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#44:1> It is a wonder we did not wind up with a Department of Meaningful

Labor and an Agency for Friendly Suburban Afternoons.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#45:1> LBJ promised a Great Society " where the city of man serves not only

the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty

and the hunger for community."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#46:1> Today Americans would settle for cities where the basic needs of the

body ( such as protection from bullets) and the rudimentary requirements of

commerce ( order; adequate education and transportation) are provided </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#47:1> Clinton 's eager beavers should ponder that, perhaps during a

herky-jerky drive down Florida Street </p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#48:1> <h> Europe, Our Former Ally</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#49:1> The bitter trade dispute reveals isolationism is growing on both

sides of the Atlantic Robert J. Samuelson We call the Europeans our 'allies'.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#50:1> This reference is an increasingly outdated relic of the cold war.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#51:1> The bitter trade dispute now raging between America and Europe merely

captures a larger reality: Western Europe is so self-absorbed that it 's

aggravating the conflicts of the post-cold-war world.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#52:1> An alliance presumes common goals.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#53:1> In practice, Europe gives only lip service to the common goals we

supposedly share </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#54:1> Ever since World War II, Americans have correctly favored greater

European unity.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#55:1> The Common Market spurred economic recovery and helped subdue the

hatreds of two world wars.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#56:1> But the latest exercise in unity - embodied in the 1991 Maastricht

Treaty - no longer deserves our admiration or support.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#57:1> It aims to create a single European currency by 1999 and to remake

the European Community ( EC) into something of a superstate.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#58:1> These foolish ambitions are bad for Europe, bad for the United States

and bad for the world.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#59:1> They inhibit Europe from playing a constructive role in international

affairs </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#60:1> Everyone knows the basic problems of the post-cold-war era.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#61:1> The first is to help Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union

establish prosperous and democratic societies.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#62:1> The second is to nurture cooperative mechanisms that enable countries

to maintain peace, healthy world trade and a cleaner environment.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#63:1> And the third is to foster strong global economic growth.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#64:1> On every count, Europe has been unhelpful </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#65:1> It has been unimaginative and stingy in dealing with the former

Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#66:1> It has been totally ineffectual in Yugoslavia.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#67:1> Its heavy farm subsidies threaten the global trading order: precisely

the type of cooperative framework that 's now needed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#68:1> As for the economy, Europe 's slump is self-inflicted and is hurting

the rest of the world.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#69:1> The slowdown resulted from poor economic policies - rigid European

exchange rates and high interest rates - adopted to cope with German

reunification </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#70:1> Europe aspires to join the United States as a superpower.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#71:1> The trouble is, Europe provides no practical or moral leadership.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#72:1> Building a more grandiose Europe serves as an all-purpose excuse to

shirk global responsibilities.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#73:1> Europe 's message to everyone else is: be selfish like us </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#74:1> Consider the current trade dispute.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#75:1> In 1962 the EC eliminated its tariff on soybeans.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#76:1> As soybean imports rose, the EC sought to stem the tide by massively

subsidizing its own farmers to grow competing oilseeds: sunflower seeds and

rapeseed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#77:1> Europe 's oilseed production jumped from 1.5 million metric tons in

1976 to 11.7 million in 1991.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#78:1> Meanwhile, its imports of oilseeds ( mainly from the United States)

dropped from 7.6 million tons to 6.3 million tons over the same period.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#79:1> In effect, the EC 's subsidies revoked the 1962 tariff concession.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#80:1> That violates the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

GATT) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#81:1> In 1989 Washington complained to GATT.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#82:1> The GATT twice ruled in our favor.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#83:1> The Europeans refused to remedy their violation.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#84:1> Only after long negotiations did we retaliate: 200 percent tariffs to

be imposed on

&dollar;300 million worth of European food imports ( mainly wine) in December </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#85:1> Global leadership requires the capacity to identify larger

international interests - consistent, to be sure, with a nation 's own

interests - and pursue them, even at some immediate domestic political cost.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#86:1> This has been the hallmark of postwar U.S. leadership.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#87:1> We helped Europe and Japan rebuild after World War II, kept a strong

military and maintained relatively open trade policies.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#88:1> It is precisely this capacity that Europe lacks </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#89:1> Irrelevant goals: On trade, perhaps the worst calamity - a

breakdown of GATT - will be avoided.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#90:1> By threatening Europe with real penalties, the tough U.S. retaliation

may prompt a settlement of the soybean dispute and the broader GATT talks.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#91:1> Even if this occurs, though, Europe seems fated to remain

self-absorbed by the impractical and irrelevant goals of the Maastricht

Treaty </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#92:1> Take a common European currency, which would replace national

ones, like the French franc.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#93:1> In the United States, a single currency works because, among other

reasons, people migrate from a region of economic weakness to one of

strength.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#94:1> Europe, divided by language and culture, lacks our flexibility.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#95:1> It 's hard to create an economic policy that suits all countries.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#96:1> The bad experience after German reunification confirms that </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#97:1> Even if a common currency could work, it is irrelevant to

Europe 's immediate needs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#98:1> If Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union slide into chaos, it

won't matter whether or not Western Europe has a common currency.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#99:1> The economic and social effects of this anarchy - unwanted

immigration, perhaps more strife as in Yugoslavia - will be overwhelming.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#100:1> But Western Europe focuses on Maastricht instead of the more

critical problems in the East </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#101:1> Europe cannot be made into a nation: it is a permanent cluster

of nationalities.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#102:1> The unrealistic effort to do so is increasingly unpopular.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#103:1> The Danes rejected Maastricht, the French approved it by 2

percentage points.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#104:1> People fear being submerged by a faceless EC bureaucracy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#105:1> To overcome hostility, Europe 's leaders pander to local interests.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#106:1> They are insensitive to outsiders, including us.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#107:1> Farm policy is one area where we' 'vesuffered; Airbus - Europe 's

subsidized commercial jet maker - is another </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#108:1> What Europe should do, as columnist William Pfaff writes in the

International Herald Tribune, is follow its " past model of progress through

pragmatic economic integration."
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#109:1> Specifically, it should bring Eastern countries into its market as

quickly as possible </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#110:1> The Persian Gulf crisis showed that Europe needs us.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#111:1> But we also need Europe as a superpower.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#112:1> All nations are looking inward, perhaps ( as after World War I)

dangerously so.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#113:1> Americans won't make the sacrifices for global leadership unless

other rich nations do likewise.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#114:1> Unfortunately, the Europeans won't play.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#115:1> They merely want to advance their own agenda.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#116:1> Their isolationism feeds ours.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#117:1> Down that path lies a world without superpowers </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-003#118:1> This Economy Won't Walk Yup.
<ICE-USA:W2E-003#119:1> But it may not be quite as crippled as you 've been led to believe

</p> </I>
