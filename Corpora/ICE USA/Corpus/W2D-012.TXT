<ICE-USA:W2D-012#2:1> How to Fish</h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#3:1> <h> If You are a Beginner at Fishing, Here is How to Fish</h> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#4:1> New to fishing?
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#5:1> Trying to learn how to fish?
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#6:1> Here are links to lots of information on beginner fishing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#7:1> Use this information to get you started. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#8:1>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#9:1> <h> Learning to Fish: What a beginner needs to know</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#10:1> Okay, so you decided you want to learn to fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#11:1> And you need to know who, what, where, when, and why on just about

every aspect of fishing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#12:1> There are a number of ways to learn, not the easiest of which is

trial and error, although that method has a more lasting effect on your

knowledge base. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#13:1> If you are looking at saltwater fishing, there are some ways to

ease your way into the sport, and painlessly learn the ropes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#14:1> If I were advising someone who was just beginning, here is where I

would point him or her: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#15:1> We are assuming that you have opted out of paying for one-on-one

lessons and that you have not hooked up with a friend willing to give of his

time to teach you one-on-one.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#16:1> Given these criteria, we will proceed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#17:1> <h> Step One</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#18:1> Go out and buy a package of seasick medicine.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#19:1> Nothing can ruin your day more than seasickness.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#20:1> You would be amazed at how easy a novice on the water can become ill.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#21:1> My recommendation is Bonine.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#22:1> It has worked in every case for the people I take fishing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#23:1> If it 's going to be a particularly rough day with heavy seas

offshore, I have been know to take some myself.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#24:1> <h> Step Two</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#25:1> Buy a reference book for beginners.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#26:1> Fishing for Dummies is a good start and is available on all the

online bookstores.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#27:1> It gives you simple instructions, terms, definitions, and generally

points you in the right direction.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#28:1> Read the book!
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#29:1> There may be things you don't understand, but read the book anyway!
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#30:1> Learn to tie several of the knots they will show you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#31:1> Contrary to popular belief, a double granny knot will not work with

fishing line.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#32:1> <h> Step Three</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#33:1> Spend the money to go on a party/head boat.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#34:1> These are boats that carry from twenty to as many as seventy anglers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#35:1> They provide everything - - bait, rod and reel, hooks, sinkers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#36:1> They even help you fish and take the fish off your line for you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#37:1> They will spot you if you are new and one of the mates will stay

close to you to help.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#38:1> They will do this partly out of customer service, but also wanting to

keep an eye on their rod and reel that they fear may accidentally go

overboard.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#39:1> Remember the seasick medicine.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#40:1> This is where you will use it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#41:1> Take a pill before you go to bed the night before and one when you

wake up.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#42:1> Then take one as you board the boat.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#43:1> Trust me, you will thank me for this reminder.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#44:1> Head boats run from

&dollar;30 to

&dollar;60 a day, and you get to keep your fish! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#45:1> Compared to the cost of a boat, fishing equipment, gas, and bait,

it is a bargain for the beginner.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#46:1> You walk on empty handed and walk off with fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#47:1> What a concept! </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#48:1> <h> Step Four</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#49:1> Assuming you have acquired the ability to operate a rod and reel

from step three, you need to find a fishing pier.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#50:1> Most coastal cities have at least one public or pay-to-fish pier that

goes out into the ocean.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#51:1> Some even have a pier that goes into a bay or river.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#52:1> These piers will often rent tackle.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#53:1> They do sell bait and terminal tackle ( that 's the hooks and sinkers

and the like) and will help you rig the rod and reel if you did not learn

either from step two or three above.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#54:1> From that point you may feel like you are on your own.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#55:1> But fear not; help abounds.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#56:1> If you ask nicely and appear to be struggling on the pier, there are

any number of pier anglers that will jump in to help you and give you advice.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#57:1> They are a special breed of angler and some of the friendliest folks

around.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#58:1> That 's a major reason for sending you to a pier in this step.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#59:1> <h> Summary</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#60:1> At this point I would repeat steps three and four several times

to make sure you are getting the hang of things.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#61:1> Up to this point you have probably been fishing with what we call a

conventional reel and a boat rod.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#62:1> Conventional reels are the ones that wind the line on the spool of

the reel similar to a winch.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#63:1> These are designed for heavy use and abuse.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#64:1> That 's why the head boats use them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#65:1> You may want to consider other sizes and types of reels and rods at

this point. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#66:1> Hopefully you have made a contact or two or even made friends

with an angler or two who can help with the decision to try another reel.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#67:1> Don't be afraid to ask a tackle shop owner for advice.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#68:1> And don't be afraid to try something new.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#69:1> <h> Two Keys to Success</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#70:1> The key to becoming a successful angler is bound by two parts.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#71:1> The first is knowing the mechanics of the equipment and bait.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#72:1> Believe it or not, this is the easiest part.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#73:1> You can become very proficient at casting, knot tying, baiting, even

without actually going fishing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#74:1> The second part is the hardest and knowing this part can make your

day.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#75:1> The second part?
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#76:1> Simply knowing where to fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#77:1> I use the term simply with tongue in cheek.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#78:1> There are tens of thousands of anglers out there who have the

mechanics down pat.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#79:1> They can cast, retrieve, bait a hook, and tie knots with the best of

them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#80:1> Only a small percentage of these anglers can be considered

successful. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#81:1> <h> Statistics</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#82:1> In almost any organization it can be said with relative assurance

that 20&percent; of the people are responsible for 80&percent; of the results of that

organization.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#83:1> Those same percentages hold true in fishing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#84:1> 20&percent; of the anglers catch 80&percent; of the fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#85:1> And there is a reason for these data.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#86:1> <h> Know the Fish</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#87:1> The successful angler, beginner and pro, know where the fish are

located at any particular time.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#88:1> Most fish move from place to place and back again with the tide and

current.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#89:1> Knowledgeable anglers learn these movements and are able to regularly

catch substantial numbers of fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#90:1> Just wetting a line in any body of water doesn't work. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#91:1> When you understand that the one of the differences between a

weekend angler and a guide who is catching fish is that the guide knows where

the fish are located, you begin to take heart.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#92:1> Now I know I will hear some heat from the guides out there, but

honestly, folks, if you are on the water every day and can keep track of the

fish, you can catch fish when others can't.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#93:1> It 's a simple fact.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#94:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#95:1> If you are planning to learn how to fish, maybe what we discussed

here can help get you started Of course, I can help answer some questions for

you as well along the way. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#96:1> So I ask all you dads and moms, what better or healthier outdoor

activity could you involve your kids in than fishing? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#97:1> You help your overall catch rate by being prepared and knowing

where to fish...</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#98:1> Do you fish the same areas over, and over again?
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#99:1> Those same flats; that same channel cutting through the grass; the

same ledge or wreck; you know all of the places you fish sometimes like the

back of your hand.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#100:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#101:1> You got to know those places over time by being familiar with

them So how can you go to a completely new area and have a chance at catching

fish the first time out?
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#102:1> Try some of these tips to get you started. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#103:1> First of all, buy a good chart of the area If its an inshore

location, you will need it for navigation.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#104:1> If you are going offshore, wreck locations, bottom contours, and GPS

numbers are on lots of fishing maps. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#105:1> Stop at a good tackle shop and ask a lot of questions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#106:1> Don't expect a lot of good answers in the early morning when they

are busy.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#107:1> Come a little later in the morning when bait buying the rush has

slowed, and simply tell the owner you are new to the area and that you would

like his or her help in locating some fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#108:1> They will be eager to help you, because if you are successful, it is

likely they just found a new customer!
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#109:1> They will mark a chart up for you if you buy it from them, and that

chart can end up being the best investment you can make. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#110:1> When you get your chart, sit down one evening and study it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#111:1> Find the cuts and channels.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#112:1> Locate the deeper holes or humps.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#113:1> Find the flats that will empty to a nearby channel at low tide.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#114:1> Chart study of this nature is basically eliminating large expanses

of water rather than finding specific holes or places to fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#115:1> In any given area, there are literally miles of water that are not

worth your while fishing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#116:1> By simply eliminating that water, you can concentrate on more

productive water. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#117:1> Find out what the tides will be on the day you plan to fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#118:1> When you talk to the local tackle shop be sure to ask which tides to

fish. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#119:1> If all else fails and you have the funds available, hire a

guide.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#120:1> One day of fishing with a guide can teach you the areas to fish, the

bait to use, and the tides to fish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#121:1> Granted, the guide may take you to only one location, but you will

at least have that location on which to count.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#122:1> Lots of you guides may get angry at me for suggesting this, but

let 's face it, it 's a paid trip and you'l 'llnly be giving up one location,

not your entire black book! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#123:1> Go to any tackle shop and look at their selection of hooks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#124:1> In a good shop, that selection can be mind boggling to the novice

angler.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#125:1> Online tackle shops can be even more daunting to anglers, because

there is no one to answer questions about certain styles of hooks and their

use.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#126:1> What 's an angler to do? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#127:1> Knowing the sizing and naming conventions of the major

categories of hooks can help make your selection an easier task.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#128:1> Yes, Virginia, the type of hook you select does make a difference,

and hook selection depends on the species of fish being sought. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#129:1> There are five basic parts to a hook: the point, gap.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#130:1> shank, eye, and barb. Each of these parts can and will be different

on the various types of hooks in use today.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#131:1> Shanks can be long or short; eyes can be round, needle, or welded;

and the gap width can vary significantly.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#132:1> All of these parts work together in each hook design, and different

hook designs are made for different fishing applications. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#133:1> There is no clear history on how the current hook sizing came

into existence.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#134:1> The measurements used today use a twofold numbering scheme that

measures from the smallest hook to the largest hook. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#135:1> The smallest hook readily available is size 24.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#136:1> This is a hook with a 1/16 of an inch gap and it 's used for tiny

trout flies.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#137:1> As the size number decreases, the width of the hook gap increases,

all the way to a size 1.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#138:1> A size 1 hook has a gap about 1/2 inch in width.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#139:1> At this point the numbering scheme changes and begins with 1/0 (

" one aught"), which is larger in size than a number 1 and goes all the way

up to 20/0, the largest commercially made hook. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#140:1> Even with this " recognized" sizing method, sizes can vary from

manufacturer and sometimes even within a manufacturer.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#141:1> There is no concrete standard. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#142:1> Hooks are all made from metal.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#143:1> The type and size of the hook is a determinant for which metal.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#144:1> Saltwater hooks are generally made from a corrosion and rust

resistant metal.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#145:1> Stainless steel is often used on the very large hooks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#146:1> Freshwater hooks can be made from wire, as most of the smaller hooks

are, or a cheaper less corrosion resistant metal. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-012#147:1> Do not be totally guided by freshwater or saltwater labels on

hooks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-012#148:1> Many freshwater hooks are used in saltwater, and they work well if

cared for properly. </p> </I>
