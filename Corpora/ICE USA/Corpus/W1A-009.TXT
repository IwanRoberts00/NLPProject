<ICE-USA:W1A-009#1:1> <h> Elementary Education: Action through Nutrition and Physical

Health</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#2:1> Although physical activity is proves to academically benefit

students, good nutrition has also been linked to an improvement in math and

reading scores as well as overall behavior. For this reason it is unfortunate

that 80 percent of children do not obtain the proper amount of fruits and

vegetables or breakfast before school ( School Breakfast Program, para. 4). A

School Breakfast Program began in 1966 and was finalized in 1975 to provide "

federally assisted meal program operating in public and nonprofit private

schools and residential child care institutions" with the intention of

increasing the amount of students who consumed breakfast in the morning (

School Breakfast Program, para. 1).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#3:1> After ten years of this program 's existence, observations were

made regarding any correlation between breakfast consumption and improved

test scores.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#4:1> From 1992-1993, only half of the nation 's elementary school ate

breakfast; whereas, from 1998-1999 more than three quarters of the students

in elementary school ate prior to school.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#5:1> Not only were math and reading scores improved during this time, but

also anxiety and stress levels were lowered ( Fox and Cole, 2004, pg. 9).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#6:1> A study was conducted by observing nineteen students, between age six

and seven, who had to eat breakfast every day consistently for one month.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#7:1> It was found that a couple hours after the students consumed a full

meal in the morning, their " performance on the tests of memory and the

ability to sustain attention were better, fewer signs of frustration were

displayed and initially more time was spent on task when working individually

in class" ( Benton, 2007, pg. 720).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#8:1> These positive behaviors show how proper nutrition can, indeed, assist

academic progress.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#9:1> Thus, elementary school should focus their attention on students'

nutrition to yield high scores in various subjects.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#10:1> Both the nutritional discrepancies—from a lack of fruits, vegetables,

and going without breakfast—impair students' academic excellence, which

explains why students who eat breakfast overall have significant higher

scores than others ( Ehrlich, 2008, slide 7). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#11:1> Many elementary schools who are financially restricted cannot

make changes in their curriculum to better student 's nutritional and physical

health, which forces them to prioritize their educational goals.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#12:1> A school 's mission statement first and foremost emphasizes the

importance of students' academic achievement and promotes empowered learners

to continuously challenge themselves.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#13:1> Additionally, schools would like to achieve the aforementioned goals

in a respectful environment to create well-behaved and healthy US citizens

with strong relationships.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#14:1> Although schools recognize the importance of encouraging good health,

for example, it is not their primary goal as educational institutions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#15:1> Nutritional and physical health are often cut when prioritizing core

classes if the school has limited funding.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#16:1> However, these schools often do not incorporate important everyday

habits that could be easily attainable without spending a cent.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#17:1> Some examples of this could include choosing reading materials

related to health or incorporating nutritional facts in science lessons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#18:1> Part of the problem is that limited action can be taken to ensure

good health in school due to the No Child Left Behind Act ( NCLB).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#19:1> This act is used to assess whether schools are successful or not,

evaluate a school 's ability to make effective changes, and measure students'

achievements through standardized tests.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#20:1> NCLB has caused public schools to narrow their focus on testing in

order to have a 100 percent student-passing rate ( Illinois State Board of

Education, para. 1).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#21:1> When schools meet the expectation of having each student pass, the

government deems them successful and provides them significantly more funding

than to other failing schools ( Illinois State Board of Education, para. 6).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#22:1> Although this act has great intentions, it is implemented poorly and

therefore it negatively affects students' health. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#23:1> Because of the No Child Left Behind Act, many physical and

nutritional health classes are removed from the school curriculum.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#24:1> Additionally, there is a reduction in the instructional time of

Physical Education classes ( Noffsinger, 2005, para. 3).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#25:1> These changes are made because schools feel pressured to allocate

more of their money to academic classes in order to maintain their " passing

school" status and keep the standards high for students. Without maintaining

that status, their funding will be even more limited and harmful to the

school 's future success.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#26:1> Rather than dramatically changing the curriculum to yield more

academic excelling results, often there is a decline academically. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#27:1> One experiment that depicts the harm threatened above was

conducted at the Salk Institute in California where two groups of mice where

observed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#28:1> Mice were used in place of humans for obvious ethical purposes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#29:1> One group was inactive and the other ran a few miles each day.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#30:1> As we can see from this experiment, the brain of the active mice

displayed more growth, especially in the hippocampus.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#31:1> The hippocampus, " [ the] brain region associated with learning and

memory, was twice as large" as compared with the inactive mice ( Dewar, 2008,

para. 3).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#32:1> After using these results to relate to overweight children in

America, it was discovered " that overweight kids found that 40 minutes a day

of aerobic exercise … helps us pay attention, plan, and resist distractions"

( Dewar, 2008, para. 14).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#33:1> When gym classes are cut and students are not given a period to run

around and let off energy, students' ability to retain a long attention and

memory span are impaired.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#34:1> Schools are so interested in shifting their focus to academic

classes, that they not only end up harming their students' health but also

their academic success.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#35:1> For this reason, cutting gym and other wellness classes can be an

unnecessary evil. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#36:1> The biggest problem is that many parents expect schools to take

full responsibility for their child 's nutrition and physical health.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#37:1> Schools do encourage students to get more involved with sports and

exercise, but it is not enough.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#38:1> The school 's ability to maintain healthy students is a goal in

addition to other academic ones.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#39:1> When kids go home and eat meals lacking in nutrition from their

parents, it defeats all the efforts that the schools put in.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#40:1> These empty calories, provided by parents, do not combat nor help the

childhood obesity problem.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#41:1> If parents took more responsibility for their children 's

extracurricular activities and healthy eating habits, then schools would not

face this dilemma of cutting classes, and this would help to alleviate the

funding crisis schools face today.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#42:1> There are many ways that parents can encourage healthy living and

eating at home.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#43:1> Parents should advocate healthy dieting at home, specifically during

meals.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#44:1> At home, it is common to have the television on during dinner.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#45:1> It is a bad habit to keep the TV during meals, however, because "

people are less likely to overeat if the TV is off and the family is focused

on family time" ( Hellmich, 2006, pg. 08d).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#46:1> Therefore, TVs that are on throughout dinner harm children 's health

because they are often unaware of how much they consume and are not paying

attention to their body 's signs of satiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#47:1> As a response, it is important to make dinner a TV-less environment

where the family can focus on their relationships and protect their

children 's overall health. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#48:1> Parents should also get children involved with exercising or

involved with a team sport.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#49:1> Televisions, once again, impair this practice as it has been observed

that, " decreasing the time they are allowed to watch TV or use the computer

will increase their physical activity" ( Hellmich, 2006, pg. 08d).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#50:1> Often parents struggle to reduce TV use among children once they have

already become accustomed to watching it several hours a day.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#51:1> In order to get children to want to be active over watching TV,

parents can " build physical activity into a child 's day by doing things like

walking to school with [ their] child - - in neighborhoods that are safe and

free of traffic congestion.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#52:1> [ Or they can] ask [ their] children what they want to do that 's fun"

( Hellmich, 2006, pg. 08d).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#53:1> These suggestions are ways that parents could help their children

without the school 's help.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#54:1> This is because it is both the school and parent 's responsibility to

improve students' health, which ultimately could prevent the difficult,

life-long condition of obesity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#55:1> Another way that parents can help is by becoming more consistent

to their requests of their children.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#56:1> It has been found that kids often imitate parents' actions as long as

the parents are consistent with their own demand.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#57:1> Similarly, children do not follow directions if the parents request

something without acting upon it themselves.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#58:1> It is imperative for parents, in addition to schools, to provide the

knowledge, skill, and attitude for food choice for children in order to make

good choices and live healthy lifestyles.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#59:1> Seeing as 2 percent of school-age kids do not consume the recommended

daily intake from the five major food groups, it is especially important for

parents to encourage better nutrition consumption for their children and for

themselves ( Forgac, 1999, pg. 49).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#60:1> The New York Times covered a study relating to this debate that

analyzed whether or not vending machines and their unhealthy contents

contributed to the overarching obesity issue that is present among grade

school students.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#61:1> The Center of Disease Control and Prevention conducted an interesting

study from 1999- 2006 on the removal of vending machines in several

elementary schools in Arkansas.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#62:1> This study concluded that over four years the average BMI rates of

students remained steady despite the removal of unhealthy snacks ( Carroll,

2006, para. 9).
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#63:1> This article shows that the presence of vending machine in schools do

not inhibit students' health or contribute to the obesity epidemic among US

children today. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#64:1> Although this study does not show a direct cause of obesity, by

having children select from high-calorie and high-fat food they are at higher

risk for other health risks, such as high blood pressure.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#65:1> It is important for schools to remove or completely revamp vending

machines to indirectly make children healthier.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#66:1> Even though schools often need the funding that popular, brand name

products provide, the school should invest in healthier snacks and sign

contracts with them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#67:1> Although for schools severing contracts will initially create a tight

budget, it allows new contracts to be signed with healthier companies that

will over time offer the same benefits of the unhealthy companies, in

addition to advancing student academic achievement. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#68:1> It is primarily difficult to develop a wellness program in a

grade school struggling to get funded by the state government.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#69:1> This struggle is due to the pressure of meeting NCLB 's Adequate

Yearly Progress requirements.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#70:1> As a result, schools often have to focus on academic classes and

teach students towards various high-stake tests.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#71:1> However, minor changes can always be made to reinforce good health

habits.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#72:1> When a school is pressured to cut physical and nutritional health,

the school needs parental support and cooperation to help reinforce these

healthy lifestyles.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#73:1> School boards spend a lot of their time discussing where they should

invest their limited money, and overall schools prefer to buy new books and

fund new programs than purchase slightly healthier snacks.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#74:1> Instead of having educational programs sponsored by fast-food

restaurants, like McDonald 's, the community libraries or bowling allies could

sponsor them to increase their budget. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-009#75:1> As educators, we could personally influence elementary students

and impact their lifestyles.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#76:1> We need to implement and enforce laws that currently exist and add

informational classes about the importance of nutritional and physical health

into our schools' curriculums.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#77:1> It cannot be assumed that children will understand why we have health

class; rather, the benefits that their choice will have in the future must be

explicitly explained to them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#78:1> By emphasizing the importance of nutrition and physical activity, we

will see improvement in academic performance.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#79:1> Our efforts may in turn not only affect our school, but also all

schools in the district.
<ICE-USA:W1A-009#80:1> This passion can easily spread throughout the nation and finally put

an end to the national obesity issue that exists in the United States of

America.</p> </I> 6
