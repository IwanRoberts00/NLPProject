<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#1:1> General - See inside front cover and pages 8 and 9 of the 1994

annual report to stockholders for information about Union Carbide 's business.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#2:1> On April 27, 1994, stockholders voted to approve the merger of

Union Carbide Corporation ( UCC) into Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics

Company Inc. ( UCC&P).
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#3:1> The merger was effective May 1, 1994.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#4:1> Immediately after the merger, UCC&P had the same consolidated assets,

liabilities and stockholders' equity as UCC.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#5:1> UCC&P has changed its name to Union Carbide Corporation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#6:1> All references to Union Carbide Corporation, the corporation or UCC

after the periods starting May 1, 1994, are a reference to the merged

company. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#7:1> Union Carbide is engaged in the chemicals and plastics business.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#8:1> The chemicals and plastics industry, especially the commodity sector,

is highly cyclical.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#9:1> Union Carbide is a major producer of certain commodity chemicals,

principally ethylene glycol and polyethylene.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#10:1> Consequently, Union Carbide 's results are subject to the swings of

the cycle in those basic chemicals.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#11:1> See pages 4 through 7 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders for a

further discussion. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#12:1> Union Carbide does not produce against a backlog of firm orders;

production is geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and to

projections of future demand.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#13:1> Inventories of finished products, work in process and raw materials

are maintained to meet delivery requirements of customers and Union Carbide 's

production schedules. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#14:1> At year-end 1994, 12,004 people were employed worldwide in

approximately 40 plants, factories and laboratories around the world. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#15:1> Raw Materials, Products and Markets-See information herein and in

the 1994 annual report to stockholders on pages 8 and 9.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#16:1> Unless otherwise indicated, the products of Union Carbide are sold

principally by its own sales force, directly to customers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#17:1> Union Carbide believes it has contracts or commitments for, or

readily available sources of, hydrocarbon feedstocks and fuel supplies to

meet its anticipated needs in all major product areas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#18:1> The corporation 's operations are dependent upon the availability of

hydrocarbon feedstocks and fuels which are purchased from diverse domestic

and international sources, including independent oil and gas producers as

well as integrated oil companies. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#19:1> The availability and price of hydrocarbon feedstocks, energy and

finished products are subject to plant interruptions and outages and to

market and political conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#20:1> Operations and products at times may be adversely affected by

legislation, government regulations, shortages, or international or domestic

events. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#21:1> Union Carbide is not dependent to a significant extent upon a

single customer or a few customers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#22:1> Patents; Trademarks; Research and Development-Union Carbide owns

a large number of United States and foreign patents that relate to a wide

variety of products and processes, has pending a substantial number of patent

applications throughout the world, and is licensed under a number of patents.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#23:1> These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#24:1> Such patents and patent applications in the aggregate are material to

Union Carbide 's competitive position.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#25:1> No one patent is considered to be material; however, the patent

portfolio relating to the UNIPOL polyethylene process technology is, in the

aggregate, considered to be material.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#26:1> Union Carbide also has a large number of trademarks.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#27:1> The UNION CARBIDE, UCAR and UNIPOL trademarks are material; no other

single trademark is material. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#28:1> Essentially all of Union Carbide 's research and development

activities are company-sponsored.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#29:1> The principal research and development facilities of Union Carbide

are indicated in the discussion of Properties ( Item 2) of this Form 10-K

report.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#30:1> In addition to the facilities specifically indicated there, product

development and process technology laboratories are maintained at some

plants.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#31:1> Union Carbide spent

&dollar;136 million in 1994,

&dollar;139 million in 1993 and

&dollar;155 million in 1992 on company-sponsored research activities to develop new

products, processes, or services, or to improve existing ones. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#32:1> Environment - See Costs Relating to Protection of the Environment

on pages 14 and 15 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders and Note 16 on

pages 35 and 36 thereof. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#33:1> Insurance - Union Carbide 's policy is to obtain public liability

insurance coverage at terms and conditions and a price that management

considers fair and reasonable.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#34:1> Union Carbide 's management believes Union Carbide has public

liability insurance in an amount sufficient to meet its current needs in

light of pending, threatened, and future litigation and claims.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#35:1> There is no assurance, however, that Union Carbide will not incur

losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of its insurance.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#36:1> Such insurance is subject to substantial deductibles. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#37:1> Competition - Each of the major products and services areas in

which Union Carbide participates is highly competitive.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#38:1> In some instances competition comes from manufacturers of the same

products as those produced by Union Carbide and in other cases from

manufacturers of different products which may serve the same markets as those

served by Union Carbide 's products.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#39:1> Some of Union Carbide 's competitors, such as companies principally

engaged in petroleum operations, have more direct access to hydrocarbon

feedstocks, and some have greater financial resources than Union Carbide.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#40:1> There are a number of competitors in each of the products and

services areas in which Union Carbide is active.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#41:1> In some of the individual areas in which Union Carbide participates

there are many competitors; in others there are few.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#42:1> Competition is primarily on price, on product performance and on

service to customers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#43:1> Many producers have important industry positions in polyethylene,

and Union Carbide is one of the world 's largest producers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#44:1> Other significant producers are Dow Chemical Company, Chevron

Corporation, Exxon Corporation, Mobil Corporation, Novacor Chemicals Ltd,

Quantum Chemicals Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Phillips

Petroleum Company, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and The British

Petroleum Company p.l.c. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#45:1> Union Carbide is the world 's largest producer of ethylene

oxide/glycol and derivatives.

Company, BASF Aktiengesellschaft, The British Petroleum Company p.l.c.,

Huntsman Corporation, ICI p.l.c., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Hoechst

Celanese Corporation, and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#47:1> In solvents and intermediates and emulsion systems, Union Carbide

has a significant position in many product areas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#48:1> Other significant producers include Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,

Hoechst Celanese Corporation, Rohm & Haas Company, Eastman Chemical Company,

Shell Oil Company, Exxon Corporation, BASF Aktiengesellschaft and Quantum

Chemicals Corporation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#49:1> Union Carbide participates in a wide range of specialty chemical

product/market areas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#50:1> The competitive position varies widely from one product/market area

to another.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#51:1> Competitors include a number of domestic and foreign companies, both

diversified and specialized. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#52:1> Union Carbide is a major marketer of petrochemical products

throughout the world.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#53:1> Products that the corporation markets are largely produced in the

United States, while competitive products are produced throughout the world.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#54:1> In addition, the corporation plans to make significant investments in

joint ventures in 1995.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#55:1> See pages 4 through 7 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders for a

further discussion. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#56:1> Union Carbide 's international operations face competition from

local producers and global competitors and a number of other risks inherent

in carrying on business outside the United States, including risks of

nationalization, expropriation, restrictive action by local governments and

changes in currency exchange rates. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-029#57:1> In management 's opinion, current facilities, together with

planned expansions, will provide adequate production capacity to meet Union

Carbide 's planned business activities.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#58:1> Capital expenditures are discussed on pages 17 and 19 of the 1994

annual report to stockholders. </p>

<ICE-USA:W1B-029#61:1> Most of the domestic properties are owned in fee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-029#62:1> Union Carbide maintains numerous domestic sales offices and

warehouses, substantially all of which are leased premises under relatively

short-term leases.
