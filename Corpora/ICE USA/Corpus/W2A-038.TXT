<ICE-USA:W2A-038#1:1> <H> 1.0 Introduction</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#2:1> The HyperText Markup Language ( HTML) used by the World-Wide Web

has limited markup and structure recognition capabilities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#3:1> Only a small set of text characteristics can be represented, and few

of these have any functional value beyond display capabilities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#4:1> The HTML ANCHOR element supports hypertext links; however, it cannot

retrieve components of a linked document, such as a single glossary entry

from a collection of several thousand entries, without resorting to programs

external to HTML and the Web server.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#5:1> In spite of these limitations, HTML and the Web are key technologies

for libraries.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#6:1> The Standard Generalized Markup Language ( SGML) is a full-

featured, standard markup language.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#7:1> HTML is actually an SGML Document Type Definition.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#8:1> Ideally, it would be possible to retrieve text documents marked up

with the richer SGML tag set via the World-Wide-Web.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#9:1> This technical paper discusses how the Web can be linked to the

PAT system, Open Text 's search engine that supports access to SGML-encoded

documents.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#10:1> This Web-to-PAT Gateway utilizes the Web 's Common Gateway Interface (

CGI) capability and SGML-to-HTML filter programs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#11:1> After briefly overviewing key technical concepts, the paper

explains the operation of the Web-to-PAT Gateway, using several examples of

how it is employed at the University of Virginia Libraries, including access

to text files such as a Middle English collection, the Oxford English

Dictionary, and the Text Encoding Initiative 's Guidelines for Electronic Text

Encoding and Interchange.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#12:1> 2.0 Key Concepts</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#13:1> This approach to using the Web to provide access to complex

textual resources involves many tools and concepts that may be unfamiliar to

the reader.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#14:1> This section provides a very brief overview of these complex topics

and it describes their interrelationships.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#15:1> <H> 2.1 SGML and HTML</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#16:1> Standards and open systems must be an essential part of library

efforts to provide large-scale, wide-area access to textual resources.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#17:1> Textual resources must be reusable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#18:1> Because of the cost of creating texts, it must be possible to use the

texts in a variety of settings with a variety of tools.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#19:1> To that end, a standards-based encoding scheme must be the foundation

of text creation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#20:1> The Standard Generalized Markup Language ( SGML), an

international standard, is such an encoding scheme, and it has proven

extremely valuable in effecting an open systems approach with text. [ 1]
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#21:1> This paper is not the place to present a detailed argument for using

SGML, especially when this has been done so effectively elsewhere. [ 2]
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#22:1> However, in addition to its value as an internationally approved

standard, SGML is ideally suited to supporting text retrieval because it is a

descriptive rather than a procedural markup language.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#23:1> SGML is a language designed to reflect the structure or function of

text, rather than simply its layout or typography.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#24:1> In a text retrieval system, portions of an SGML document can be

searched and retrieved, and functionally different textual elements can be

displayed in accordance with their function.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#25:1> The difficulty of designing an implementation of SGML to meet a

broad range of text processing needs in the humanities has been met by the

Text Encoding Initiative ( TEI) in its Guidelines for Electronic Text

Encoding and Interchange. [ 3]
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#26:1> The application of SGML using the TEI Guidelines will play a central

role in ensuring that textual resources--particularly those important to

textual studies--are produced in a way that make them flexible and of

continuing value.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#27:1> The TEI itself is a collaborative project of the Association for

Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics,

and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#28:1> Its purpose is the promulgation of guidelines for the markup of

electronic text for a variety of disciplines involved in the study of text.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#29:1> In mid-1994, a comprehensive and detailed two volume set of

guidelines was published.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#30:1> The print version of the TEI Guidelines is an absolutely essential

acquisition by libraries; an electronic version has been made available by

the author. [ 4]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#31:1> A central feature of SGML is the DTD ( Document Type Definition).
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#32:1> The DTD is a codification of the possible textual characteristics in

a given document or set of documents.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#33:1> SGML expresses the organization of a document without necessarily

using the file system paradigm ( i.e., discrete files representing the

organizational components of a document).
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#34:1> It expresses textual features ( e.g., footnotes, tables, and

headings) and the building blocks of content ( e.g., paragraphs) using a

descriptive language focusing on the role of the element, rather than some

presumed display value.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#35:1> SGML is not a tag set, but a grammar, with the " vocabulary"--or

tags--of an individual document being articulated in its DTD.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#36:1> Using this rigorous grammar, SGML can both declare information about

the document in a way that can be transported with the document and can

enforce rules in the application of markup by aiding in " parsing" the

document.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#37:1> The HyperText Markup Language ( HTML), which is used with the

Web, is a form of SGML expressed by its own unique DTD.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#38:1> The shape of the HTML DTD has changed significantly since first

articulated by researchers at CERN, and it continues to change with the

demands of the Web. [ 5]
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#39:1> HTML was designed to facilitate making documents available on the

Web, and it expresses a variety of features such as textual characteristics

and hypertext links.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#40:1> These hypertext links are HTML 's most useful capability because they

allow authors to link documents to other resources throughout the Internet,

effectively making the Internet into a large hypertext document.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#41:1> <H> 2.2 CGI and FORM Use</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#42:1> The Web is far more than a server protocol for the transfer of

HTML documents.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#43:1> Among the many resources it offers in facilitating sophisticated

retrieval of information is the Common Gateway Interface ( CGI).
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#44:1> Like HTML, CGI is in transition.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#45:1> However, in its current state, it offers capabilities that allow the

Web to support much more complex documents and retrievals than HTML alone

supports.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#46:1> The Common Gateway Interface is a set of specifications for external

gateway programs to speak to the Web 's server protocol, HTTP.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#47:1> It allows the administrator to run external programs from the Web

server in such a way that requests from the server return a desired document

to the user or, more typically, generate a document on the fly.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#48:1> This capability makes it possible to provide uniform access to data

structures or servers that are completely independent of the HTTP, including

structures such as those represented in SGML documents or Z39.50 servers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#49:1> The CGI specification is available on the NCSA documentation Web

server. [ 6]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#50:1> Closely associated with the CGI is the FORM specification, which

was first introduced with NCSA 's Mosaic Web client.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#51:1> This feature is a client-independent mechanism to submit complex

queries, usually through a graphical user interface.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#52:1> FORM-compliant interfaces such as Mosaic, Lynx ( a UNIX VT100

client), and OmniWeb ( a NeXTStep client) use fill-out forms, check boxes,

and lists to mediate queries between the user and CGI resources.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#53:1> Users respond by making selections that qualify submissions to the

server ( e.g., checking a box to indicate that a search is an author search)

thereby making a complex command-line syntax unnecessary. [ 7]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#54:1> 2.3 Computer Languages and CGI</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#55:1> CGI programs can be written in a variety of languages, including

UNIX shell scripts, C programs, and Perl.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#56:1> In fact, there are few limitations on the type of language that can

be used.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#57:1> Perl is foremost among the options available to most Web

administrators.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#58:1> Largely the work of Larry Wall, Perl can be used to create extremely

fast and flexible programs with no practical limits on the size of the

material it can treat.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#59:1> Perl also has outstanding support for the UNIX " regular expression,"

making it ideal for text systems where one form of markup must be translated

to another. [ 8]</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#60:1> <H> 3.0 The Web-to-PAT Gateway</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#61:1> The modular approach taken in the Web-to-PAT Gateway separates

the operations of retrieval to allow one component ( e.g., an SGML-to-HTML

filter) to be upgraded without affecting other components.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#62:1> It should be emphasized that this separation of operations grew out

of local needs and that other approaches, including an approach that combines

all operations in a single program, are possible.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#63:1> The four steps are:</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#64:1> <H> 1. FORM Handling</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#65:1> Users, with the aid of the FORM, submit a query.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#66:1> <H> 2. CGI Query Handling</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#67:1> The query is received and translated to a PAT search.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#68:1> <H> 3. PAT Result Handling</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#69:1> Information returned from PAT is transformed into lists or

entries that can be selected.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#70:1> <H> 4. SGML-to-HTML Filtering</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#71:1> The richer SGML is transformed into HTML.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#72:1> This multi-stage approach has many advantages.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#73:1> For example, it is possible to use different programming languages or

other software tools for each processing stage, selecting them based on their

utility for particular functions or their ability to comply with local

requirements.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#74:1> In the approach documented here, HTML FORMs, shell programs, C

programs, and Perl programs have been used for the four operations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#75:1> Separating the functions also allows persons with different

responsibilities, skills, or interests to manage the different processes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#76:1> For example, a system administrator might manage the second and third

stages, while someone responsible for more aesthetic issues in the delivery

might manage parts of the first and the fourth stages.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#77:1> At the University of Virginia Library, SGML-to-HTML filters continue

to be enhanced by staff from the Library 's Electronic Text Center in a

process completely separate from the development of other parts of the

interface.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#78:1> <H> 3.1 HTML FORM for Query Submission</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#79:1> The use of an HTML FORM to handle query submission may be simple

or complex.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#80:1> The three examples given here demonstrate that range: the Middle

English FORM supports word and phrase searches; the Oxford English Dictionary

search provides a great deal of information about the areas to be searched

and information to be retrieved; and the TEI Guidelines FORM allows users to

browse the document in a variety of ways, such as by chapter or other

section.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#81:1> ( The Middle English and TEI Guidelines resources are encoded in

SGML.)</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#82:1> <H> 3.1.1 Middle English Query</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#83:1> The FORM created for Middle English materials was deliberately

made simple to allow users to retrieve keywords-in-context ( KWIC) without

knowing commands such as those needed to view search results. [ 9]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#84:1> A search term is requested from the user and registered as the

variable " query." So that neither the user or system is overwhelmed by large

result sets, the size of result sets is limited to 100 items, and an

additional FORM option ( registering the variable " size") is included to

help the user subsequently move through the results 100 items at a time or to

sample 100 items from the entire result set.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#85:1> <H> 3.1.2 OED Query</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#86:1> The richness of the Oxford English Dictionary ( OED) is often

overwhelming even for sophisticated users.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#87:1> Most users do not want keyword-in-context results and would prefer

simple look up capabilities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#88:1> The OED is a complex product designed to facilitate a broad array of

activities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#89:1> Consequently, even simple searches require elaborate query

structures.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#90:1> The OED FORM assists users in submitting many of the most

commonly performed searches, including dictionary entry retrieval with simple

look ups and truncated term look ups ( e.g., " photo" for all words beginning

with this stem). [ 10]
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#91:1> It is also possible to retrieve quotations by the quote 's author (

e.g., retrieval of all quotations authored by Chaucer).
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#92:1> This process includes the following:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#93:1> 1. In the FORM, the user submits a search term which is captured

as the variable " query."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#94:1> 2. The user selects the type of search. Many types of searches

are possible, including traditional look ups, alphabetic browses, full-text

searches, and quotation retrieval.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#95:1> 3. Several other elements are used to limit the size of results.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#96:1> As in the Middle English search FORM, a default of no more than 100

results at a time may be viewed from each search.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#97:1> 4. In addition, a variable called " period" is offered to allow

users to limit quotation searches by century.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#98:1> <H> 3.1.3 TEI Guidelines Query</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#99:1> The structured browsing of the TEI Guidelines adds another

important feature for mediating access to large or complex collections.
<ICE-USA:W2A-038#100:1> Users of the TEI Guidelines are as likely to want to read a chapter

or section as they are to want to search the contents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#101:1> To facilitate this sort of browsing, an initial HTML page is

created containing the titles of the major SGML hierarchical structures of

the TEI Guidelines ( e.g., the DIV0 element), and each of these structures is

linked to an HTML page containing the titles of subsidiary structures ( e.g.,

the DIV1 through DIV4 elements). [ 11]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-038#102:1> For example, the top-level HTML page is linked to the secondary

HTML page for Part I of the TEI Guidelines. [ 12]</p> <&> GRAPH, TABLE,
