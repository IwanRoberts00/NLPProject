<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-025#1:1> The pipeline for geoscience professionals, men and women, begins

well before the first employment and before the first undergraduate college

course.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#2:1> It begins some time during pre-college education.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#3:1> Motivation supporting the choice of geoscience as a career varies from

rocks, fossils, and other collectibles gathered in childhood exploration, to

fascination with abstract concepts of Earth, such as the K/T boundary, plate

tectonics and global-climate change.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#4:1> Yet, for women this often is not enough.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#>To develop that

gleam of interest in earth science into a career, those elements or concepts

must be polished by formal training.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#5:1> But even at the middle- or junior-high level, when most earth-science

courses are taught, only 23 percent of students are exposed at all to earth

science in their academic curriculum.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#6:1> So the problems experienced by women students begin with the dearth of

pre-college experiences in earth science.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#7:1> Females face more problems because they experience science education

in a negative learning environment that may result in diminished self-esteem

and minimal opportunities for experiencing positive role-models.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#>

Studies on the classroom environment have led many researchers to support the

thesis that classroom socialization has a significant impact on the

self-esteem of students.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#8:1> Problems include teacher bias against girls in selection of girls as

activity leaders, equitable treatment in question-and-answer sessions and,

generally, in the low expectations of high-quality performance by girls in

science.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#9:1> Parents of girls also show these biases.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> The term

girl-friendly science describes a learning environment that supports female

students.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#10:1> Some factors contributing to such an environment include individual

and small-group activities, student-directed inquiry, cooperative rather than

competitive student arrangements, equal access to physical tasks ( especially

equipment use), and opportunities for successful learning experiences.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#11:1> The goal is for all students to be encouraged to take part, to

respond, and to encourage each other.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Bud Chipman 's model indicates

participation in higher education is affected mainly by an individual 's

expectation of success, which includes such factors as self-perceived ability

( self-esteem), social stereotypes, and prior experiences.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#12:1> Chipman 's model provides a clear schematic for addressing relevant

factors to improve the educational--or professional--environment.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#>

Another problem is the image of scientists portrayed in science textbooks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#13:1> Surveys, even quite recent ones, show that illustrations of white

male scientists are predominant.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#14:1> Without exposure to women scientists, young women do not usually

perceive themselves in that role.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#15:1> In one study of five major biology texts ( 1983 and 1985) from major

U.S. publishers, illustrations of females were 30 percent, 35 percent, 34

percent, 49 percent, and 32 percent of all depictions ( Kahle & Matyas,

1987).
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#16:1> Note that the percentage of female Ph.D. recipients in biology in

1988 was 35 percent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#17:1> That corresponds closely to the percentages of women shown in the

textbooks, perhaps a positive element for students.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#18:1> Similar studies of geoscience texts have not been reported.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#>

Another analysis compares students' self-perception of their skills to their

grades.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#19:1> Girls usually perceive themselves to be less successful than their

male peers, although their grades indicate that they perform as well as or

better than their male counterparts ( Widnall, 1988).</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Negative

socialization practices are also evident in graduate education, where it may

have its most clearly measured effect on the participation of women in

science.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#20:1> Although standardized text scores indicate that women have superior

achievement in verbal and analytical test areas, and males have superior

achievement in math, surveys indicate that women enter graduate school at a

rate about equal to men relative to their participation in baccalaureate

degrees.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#21:1> The preparedness of women students is also about equal to males as

shown by grade-point average.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#22:1> Yet women seem to have less success at achieving graduate degrees,

particularly doctoral degrees, despite entering the programs as well prepared

as their male counterparts ( Widnall, 1988).</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Anecdotal surveys

suggest that this difference is the result of the poor quality of

interpersonal support of women students by faculty and by men students.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#23:1> Women indicate that they receive less information about internal

processes, such as opportunities for financial and research support,

participation in department meetings and informal news-sharing activities,

and anecdotal information on handling qualifying exams.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#24:1> Also, women students report that they have fewer meetings with thesis

advisers, less useful feedback from faculty, fewer opportunities for

responsibility within a research group, and problems with peer acceptance in

student networks and study groups ( Widnall, 1988).
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#25:1> Many aspects of successful graduate education require mentors, since

learning the non-academic aspects of a profession is based largely in

supportive guidance.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Mildred Dresselhaus, Massachusetts Institute

of Technology, suggests, " If the practices of those departments that have

been most successful at retaining women could be adopted by those

experiencing serious problems, it should be very easy to double the number of

women degree recipients.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#26:1> Good climates for women tend to have more women role models,

well-established equal-opportunity environments, career-development networks,

and, most important, the commitment of their top officers."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-025#27:1> Many of these problems also surface in the professional ranks of

women in geoscience.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#28:1> The lack of female geoscience faculty, particularly at the

full-professor level, has been reported by Maria L. Crawford and others in

several papers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#29:1> Barriers for women academic professionals include many of those for

women graduate students, but also include problems of access to promotion and

tenure, minimal support for family care situations, and even questions of

credibility and quality of work, despite proven track records of research and

publications ( Brush, 1991).
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#30:1> Women geoscientists in other employment sectors reflect similar

problems.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> The chilly climate for women in science is not restricted

to the geosciences, but it does seem more exaggerated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#31:1> A recent survey of starting salaries for baccalaureate geoscientists

shows that women in geoscience have the least equity in compensation ( 68

percent) compared with their male counterparts and with other scientific

disciplines ( Committee on Professionals in Science and Technology,

1990).</p>

<p> Despite the high percentage of women students considering geoscience as a

career, ( as high as 42 percent of freshman/sophomore enrollment) the number

is diminished to a mere 19 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in

geoscience.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#32:1> However, the leaky pipeline is not a hopeless fixture.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#33:1> By reinforcing support across transition points, that is, at high

school-to-college, undergraduate-to-graduate school, and graduate

school-to-professional population, much of this wasted human resource can be

retained.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#34:1> The chief effort must be to improve the quality of the educational

experience.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#35:1> Improving professional opportunities is even more crucial; without

that improvement all other efforts are likely to have little

effect.</p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#><h> FOR OIL: Effects on land, air, and sea </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-025#36:1> Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2,1990.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#37:1> During the eight months that followed, preparing for and conducting

war in the Persian Gulf ( known by Arabs as the Arabian Gulf) region caused

much degradation to the air, land and sea.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#38:1> Environmental impacts on the atmosphere resulted from the burning of

oil wells, on the Gulf water from several oil spills, and on the land from

disturbances of the desert surface.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Wanton explosion of 732 oil

wells resulted in oppressive pollution of the air as it carried chemicals and

soot particles, s well as droplets of unburned oil.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#39:1> Sulfur oxides combined with water to form acid rain that with other

products increased the acidity of soils, suffocated desert plants and locally

caused severe respiratory problems to humans.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Early predictions of

a global meteorological disaster proved wrong.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#40:1> The forecasts of a " nuclear winter" over Europe and the rest of the

world were not based on knowledge of the wind directions in the Gulf region.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#41:1> They also did not take into account the fact that particulates from

the burning wells are too heavy to rise to the stratosphere and spread around

the globe.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#42:1> These particulates remained mostly below 8,000 feet and did not rise

much above 22,000 feet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#43:1> Thus, their effects remained in the region of the Arabian Peninsula

and nearby areas of northwestern India and East Africa.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Thanks to

unprecedented efforts of 27 teams of firefighters, the last oil-well fires

were capped in November 1991.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#44:1> However, trails of the fire plumes remain etched on the desert

surface as a deposit of soot and oil droplets up to two inches thick.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#45:1> These trails betray the prevailing wind direction of the winter and

particularly summer Shamal winds from the north/northwest.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> The

coastal and marine environments of the western Gulf were drastically affected

by oil spills estimated at eight million barrels.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#46:1> The slow counter-clockwise water currents of the Gulf moved the oil

along the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, endangering marine life,

polluting hundreds of miles of coastline and threatening water desalination

plants.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#47:1> Nearly two million barrels of oil were skimmed off the Gulf water at

two locations near Dhahran and Jubail in Saudi Arabia.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> As the light

components of oil evaporated from air exposure and the high temperature of

the Gulf water, heavy components found their way either to coastal areas or

sank to the bottom.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#48:1> At the northern tip of Qatar 300 miles south of Kuwait, more than 10

feet of coastline are covered with heavy oil.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#49:1> In many places, this tarry layer was superimposed on remains of the

1983oil spill that was a result of the Iran/Iraq war.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Skimmed oil

from the coastal water and beaches is stored in large pools or in heaps in

the open desert.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#50:1> One major concern is whether some of it might seep through fractures

to pollute ground-water resources that are used in agriculture.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#>

Effects on the land surface of Kuwait and northeastern Saudi Arabia are even

more serious.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#51:1> In Kuwait, hundreds of oil lakes stud the desert surface.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#52:1> These were formed from wells that were destroyed but did not catch

fire, as well as from burning wells that had to be kept flowing so as to cool

after the fires were put out.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#53:1> These lakes, up to eight feet deep, remain a death trap for insects

and birds, emit noxious gases, and may also seep to pollute the ground

water.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Changes to the contours of the land by building trenches,

berms and other sand walls, and hiding places for military equipment,

personnel, and ammunition, destroyed much of the desert pavement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#54:1> This pavement is usually a one-grain thick layer of pebbles that

protects fine-grained soil from wind action.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#55:1> The disruption of this layer resulted in whirling fine particles as

dust by the Shamal winds, and the accumulation of sand-size particles into

dunes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#56:1> These dunes have already blocked roads in northern Kuwait and their

continued movement threatens farms and other installations in the open

desert.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Efforts have now begun to assess the damage to the region

from the Gulf War and to plan environmental monitoring in the future.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#57:1> As a first step, a joint research project is being planned between

Boston University and the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research to use

satellite imagery to assess the damage, followed by field confirmations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#58:1> It is believed that although the damage to the atmosphere were

short-lived, the impact on the Gulf water may persist for decades and the

effects on the desert surface may last for centuries.</p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#><h><ICE-USA:W2B-025#>SYNTHETIC

QUAKES MODEL FOR LONG-TERM PREDICTION</h><ICE-USA:W2B-025#><h> By Steven N. Ward</h><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#>

Long-term earthquake prediction is one of the major goals of seismologists,

like myself.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#59:1> Long-term predictions are couched in probabilities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#60:1> For example, " There is a 30 percent chance of a magnitude 7 or

greater quake occurring on a certain section of a fault within the next 30

years."
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#61:1> The staple of long-term predictions is, of course, the statistics of

earthquake recur-rence.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> Most simply, the statistics reduce to a

probability function containing two parameters: ( formula), the mean repeat

time of a certain size quake at a given place; and ( formula), the variation

of the recurrence interval about the mean.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#62:1> Naturally, forecasts developed from probability functions are only as

good as the observations that constrain their parameters.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#63:1> In the past, the observations have been restricted almost exclusively

to the repetition intervals of large historical earthquakes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#64:1> Unfortunately, well-documented repetitions rarely number more than

about five, so the fitting of even two parameters to these intervals entails

considerable uncertainty, and confidence in the resulting prediction suffers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#65:1> Consider the pattern of this century 's large earthquakes along the

Middle America Trench in southwest Mexico.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#66:1> From this data, imagine trying to determine(formula) or ( formula) of

the probability function controlling earthquake recurrence at any position

along the coast.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#67:1> It 's nearly impossible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#68:1> Simply, there are not enough samples to say just how regularly or

irregularly earthquakes strike.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-025#> In view of the fundamental

restrictions in sampling earthquake recurrences, it seems to me that

refinements in long-term earthquake prediction will have to spring from more

innovative approaches.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#69:1> Here, computer simulation comes into play.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#70:1> Suppose that I can build a " credible" synthetic model of seismicity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#71:1> If so, the sampling problem would be eliminated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-025#72:1> Synthetic seismicity has an advantage over the real thing in that

computer histories can be extended indefinitely to collect a statistically

significant number of earthquake recurrences, whether it takes 500 computer

years, or 5,000 or 50,000.</p></I> пя
