<ICE-USA:W2E-009#1:1> <h> AS FOR FLIP-FLOPPING, COLIN POWELL IS AS ADEPT AS ANYBODY</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#2:1> The widespread encouragement that Colin Powell is receiving for

making a run for the White House says more about some people 's yearning for a

messiah figure to deliver us from our collective sins, from racism to crime,

than it does about reality.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#3:1> It also says something about our willingness ( and the willingness of

those who want Powell to be president in order to advance their own careers)

to ignore unpleasant truths about the man with the golden image.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#4:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#5:1> For instance, look at the memorandum that House Speaker Newt Gingrich

requested from University of Texas Professor Marvin Olasky on " The Powell I

Could Not Support - And The Powell I Could.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#6:1> " The memo is a triumph of wishful thinking.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#7:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#8:1> Olasky, who has contributed much intellectual substance to the

Republican plan to overhaul welfare, hopes that Powell may not be a closet

liberal and, though pro-choice on abortion, ( ITAL) could ( unITAL) be

persuaded to speak and act in ways that would reduce the number of abortions.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#9:1> He also believes that if Powell were to become president, he might use

the " bully pulpit" and the Department of Education to push abstinence so

that fewer teen-agers would get pregnant in the first place.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#10:1> But a pro-life candidate could do the same with far more conviction.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#11:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#12:1> Why, it must be asked, would voters consider a man untested in

politics to be their president?
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#13:1> If Bob Dole or Phil Gramm announced they wanted to be chairman of the

Joint Chiefs, would anyone take them seriously?
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#14:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#15:1> Five years ago, few outside the Washington foreign policy

community had heard of Colin Powell.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#16:1> He was just another military bureaucrat.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#17:1> The Persian Gulf War changed that, but Powell emerged from that

conflict with more stars than he deserved.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#18:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#19:1> The record shows that in every Gulf planning session, Gen. Powell

raised the possibility of an American blood bath and urged President Bush to

use economic sanctions, not troops, to thwart Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 's

invasion of Kuwait.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#20:1> When Bush overruled him, Powell devised a plan of attack for the U.N.

forces that was vintage World War I " over the top" stuff.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#21:1> Norman Schwarzkopf was so opposed that he threatened to resign if

forced to implement it.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#22:1> Assistant Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger called the Powell

plan the real recipe for an American bloodbath.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#23:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#24:1> In an apparent attempt to cover himself, Powell called in The

Washington Post 's Bob Woodward on the eve of Bush 's fateful moment.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#25:1> He told Woodward of his deep misgivings about the Bush strategy for

repelling Saddam 's aggression and relayed his own belief in economic

sanctions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#26:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#27:1> Schwarzkopf and Bush were vindicated by America 's finest military

hour since World War Two.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#28:1> When Woodward 's book, " The Commanders," was published, it told of

Powell 's opposition to Bush 's military decisions.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#29:1> Worse, we learned that Powell had positioned himself so that he could

have wiggled out of any responsibility should the war have gone badly.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#30:1> It would have been said that Bush overruled the professional advice

of his Joint Chiefs chairman.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#31:1> But to liberals in congress, Powell would have been a hero.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#32:1> By speaking out of turn to Woodward, Powell was disloyal to his

commander in chief.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#33:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#34:1> Liberal journalists see Powell as the anti-revolutionary who could

beat back the voters' intentions expressed in the 1994 election.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#35:1> Powell himself has called the Contract With America " harsh and

punitive.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#36:1> " But who knows where this man who is so adept at flip-flopping

really stands?
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#37:1> As he writes in his book, he started out as a center-leftist.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#38:1> But, after declaring himself pro-choice and for affirmative action

and for the Million Man March, within days he changed to " generally in line

with the Christian right" and questioned the leadership of the march.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#39:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#40:1> Powell could fill an important role as a racial healer while speaking

out for abstinence and personal responsibility.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#41:1> He could do this in the House or Senate, as a governor, a university

president, or in private life.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#42:1> But if he chooses to run for President and appears to be a front man

for convictionless " Rockefeller Republicans," who lack a viable candidate,

he will open himself up to attacks on his record in the military and his

self-serving confessional to Bob Woodward.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#43:1> That will begin a battle he cannot win and he will be a candidate for

whom most social conservatives cannot and will not vote.<p><ICE-USA:W2E-009#>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#44:1> <h> HEADLINE: SEARCH FOR TRUTH, EXTRA VIGILANCE ARE PROPER RESPONSE

TO DERAILMENT</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#45:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#46:1> FBI agents, police, politicians and the American people should beware

a rush to judgment about what kind of person or group might have derailed a

train in the Arizona desert, why they did it and what needs to be done about

it.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#47:1> Leaping to conclusions can lead to miscalculations that threaten the

innocent and hinder the search for truth.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#48:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#49:1> Remember the widespread speculation blaming the April 19 Oklahoma

City Federal building bombing on Arab terrorists from overseas?
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#50:1> Careful investigation led to charges against a couple of disgruntled

anti-government loners, both non-Arab Americans.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#51:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#52:1> Congress should not let the derailment pressure them into approving

any anti-terrorism laws that threaten civil liberties.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#53:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#54:1> FBI agents and police must keep their minds open, uniting their full

resources to bring the sick, cowardly perpetrators of this despicable,

murderous crime to justice.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#55:1> To boost deterrence, Amtrak is rightly stepping up recautions at

train stations and increasing surveillance along the tracks. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#56:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#57:1> Americans whose sense of security has been shaken should take some

comfort from knowing law enforcement agencies have a good track record in

recent years in catching people who commit such crimes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#58:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#59:1> Could the derailment be organized anti-government terrorism?
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#60:1> Possibly.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#61:1> The main clue, a note signed by " Sons of Gestapo" could be genuine.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#62:1> But it also could be a red herring to distract the FBI from the real

saboteurs and their motives.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#63:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#64:1> Could it be vandalism that got out of hand or a psycho 's way of

causing mindless destruction?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#65:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#66:1> Or could it be a disgruntled Amtrak employee or ex-employee with a

grudge against his bosses?
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#67:1> The saboteur clearly had an insider 's knowledge of how to avoid

triggering an electronic warning signal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#68:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#69:1> Until more information is known, avoid leaping to premature

conclusions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#70:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#71:1> So far, it 's clearcut sabotage and murder, motivation uncertain.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#72:1> There 's a big leap from that to organized terrorism, although the

victims may find the distinction mere nit-picking.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#73:1> <h> MAKE STUDY OF LEGALIZED GAMBLING TO BE SURE REGULATION MEETS

NEED</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#74:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#75:1> Congress should move swiftly to create a proposed national commission

to study the enormously destructive impacts of legalized gambling and

recommend ways to reduce that harm.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#76:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#77:1> The major threat is a severe psychological illness called gambling

addiction, no less real than addiction to alcohol or drugs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#78:1> More than 10.6 million Americans ( 1.3 million teen-agers) are

estimated victims, 400,000 in Florida.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#79:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#80:1> Compulsive gamblers chasing elusive jackpots and an artificial "

high" gamble away billions needed for rent, groceries, utilities, child

support and other necessities of life.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#81:1> Some people write bad checks, engage in fraud or embezzlement, borrow

from loansharks at exorbitant interest rates or steal to feed their habit.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#82:1> At the bottom, they destroy themselves and their families.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#83:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#84:1> Research shows gambling generally has its most harmful impact on

those who can least afford it, the poor.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#85:1> A steady increase in casino gambling by teen-agers, despite legal

bans, is cause for alarm in part because it encourages them to regularly

engage in illegal behavior. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#86:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#87:1> Casinos promise huge economic benefits, then cannibalize the local

economy because free or low-cost meals, drinks and hotel rooms force

competitors out of business.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#88:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#89:1> In gambling towns, rates of desertion, personal bankruptcy, divorce,

mental illness and suicide are far higher than elsewhere. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#90:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#91:1> Gambling erodes moral standards by fueling unhealthy attitudes: You

can get something for nothing.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#92:1> You don't need the self-discipline to study or work hard to achieve

success, just bet on random events, mostly beyond human control.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#93:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#94:1> In places like Atlantic City, casinos have propelled a huge rise in

property values, driving longtime business and home owners away.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#95:1> They also brought more crime such as prostitution, money-laundering,

loan-sharking, mob infiltration and political corruption.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#96:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#97:1> Gambling is big business.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#98:1> Nationwide, gamblers bet half a trillion dollars a year, and lose

&dollar; 40 billion.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#99:1> Legalized gambling, once rare, is now proliferating: 37 states,

including Florida, have state-run lotteries and 23 states, not including

Florida, allow casinos.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#100:1> Florida allows gambling at horse and dog tracks and jai alai

frontons.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#101:1> Casinos are located on cruise ships that sail three miles offshore.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#102:1> A proposed state constitutional amendment legalizing casinos in

Florida is heading for the November 1996 ballot.</P> <p.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#103:1> An honest, independent study of the true national impacts of

legalized gambling could be a real eye-opener.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#104:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#105:1> It is unlikely that the federal government would ever ban legalized

gambling, given its popularity.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#106:1> At least, a study commission could provide guidelines to improve

gambling regulation and offer some shocking public education to help gambling

addicts and others learn to resist the siren 's song of the sucker bet.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#107:1> <h> DURENBERGER, REYNOLDS FIND OUT HARD WAY THEY AREN'T ABOVE THE

LAW</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#108:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#109:1> Among the many faults of Congress, in the minds of an increasingly

annoyed public, is insufferable personal arrogance.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#110:1> Although some members of Congress maintain a level outlook, others

fall under the self-induced spell they'r 'reither above the law or simply not

governed by rules affecting everyone else.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#111:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#112:1> When a couple of these arrogant scoundrels are brought to heel, as

Dave Durenberger and Mel Reynolds were this week, public reaction can be

mixed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#113:1> The satisfaction of knowing they' 'llbe punished for their violations

is dulled by the confirmation of long-suspected wrongdoing.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#114:1> We' 'reglad they were caught, but wonder how many of their colleagues

are getting away with similar criminal or unethical acts. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#115:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#116:1> Durenberger, of Minnesota, no longer in the U.S. Senate, has long

insisted he committed no crime in his unusual expense account claims.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#117:1> Finally, in a transparent attempt to avoid a felony conviction and

probable prison time, Durenberger admitted five misdemeanor charges of

stealing public money by abusing his expense account.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#118:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#119:1> " Stealing" is precisely correct.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#120:1> Durenberger would stay in a Minneapolis condominium he owned, then

bill the taxpayers as if he had rented a hotel room.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#121:1> He admitted running up

&dollar; 3,825 in bogus expense items and expects to be punished lightly by getting

probation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#122:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#123:1> Under federal sentencing guidelines, he could be imprisoned for 10

months, but why be vindictive?
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#124:1> Durenberger, a Republican, has been cut down to his tiny size.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#125:1> The Senate denounced him, he lost his law license and was forced out

of office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#126:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#127:1> That 's enough.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#128:1> Durenberger, 61, never again will be a factor in public life, nor

should he be.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#129:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#130:1> Reynolds, a Chicago Democrat and current member of the House, almost

certainly will spend time in prison after his jury conviction on 12 criminal

charges.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#131:1> The conviction of criminal sexual assault alone requires a four-year

mandatory minimum sentence.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#132:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#133:1> The jury refused to buy his claim that he had " phone sex" with a

16-year-old girl, but nothing else.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#134:1> The testimony against Reynolds was too convincing, and the jury

obviously was disgusted with a person in a position of authority using his

power on a teen-ager, even if she consented to their sordid sexual

relationship.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#135:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#136:1> No role model for anyone despite his Ivy League and Rhodes Scholar

background, Reynolds also was convicted of child pornography, sexual abuse

and obstruction of justice.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#137:1> The jury concluded he tried to pressure the star witness against him

to leave town.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#138:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#139:1> Unless his appeal unexpectedly succeeds, Reynolds at 43 also seems

destined to be a nonentity in public life.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#140:1> Shed no tears for him or Durenberger.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#141:1> In their rotten cases, arrogance brought its own reward by bringing

them down.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-009#142:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#143:1> It would be comforting to believe no one else in Congress is

behaving in similar unlawful ways.
<ICE-USA:W2E-009#144:1> Comforting but naive.</p> </I>
