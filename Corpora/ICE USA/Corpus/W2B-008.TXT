<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#1:1> This paper is concerned with Aristotle 's account of primary

substances ( ousiai) as presented in the Categories.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#2:1> It is argued that one of his criteria for primary substances--the

existential criterion--impales Aristotle on the horns of a dilemma: either

Aristotle must admit substantial kinds as primary substances or he must

countenance the existence of bare particulars.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#3:1> However, the former alternative contradicts Aristotle 's remarks

concerning the nature of primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#4:1> While, the latter alternative cannot be squared with the ontology

found in the Categories.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#5:1> It is my belief that it was his awareness of these problems that lead

Aristotle to drop the ontology of the Categories and develop the more complex

ontology of the Metaphysics.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#6:1> In order to supply a perspicuous rendering of the dilemma, it is

necessary to first outline the basics of Aristotle 's ontology in the

Categories, and then to closely examine his criteria for primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#7:1> Only then can we proceed to a detailed examination of the dilemma.

</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#8:1> <h> 1.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#9:1> Basic Ontology</h> </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#10:1> <h> 1.1 Properties and Particulars</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#11:1> Two entities found in the ontology of the Categories are ( a)

individuals or particulars and ( b) properties.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#12:1> Examples of particulars are " a man," " the individual man," " an

animal," " the individual horse," " a picture," and " an ox.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#13:1> Whereas examples of properties are " four-foot," " grammatical," "

has armour on," " white," and the relational properties, " double," " half,"

and " in" ( for example, in the market place and in the Lyceum). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#14:1> It appears to be a clear and uncontroversial point within

Aristotelian scholarship, and one that I am in agreement with, that Aristotle

holds some version of a substance-attribute theory of particulars ( as

opposed to a bundle theory of particulars).
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#15:1> It is also clear that so far as properties are concerned, Aristotle

is a realist, as opposed to a nominalist.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#16:1> That is, he allows that there really are such things in the world as

properties and relations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#17:1> What is less clear is whether he holds properties to be universals or

tropes ( understood as property instances).
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#18:1> I side with the view that Aristotle takes properties to be

universals.[1]
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#19:1> However, this issue, while of intrinsic interest, is of minimal

importance to my thesis, because the soundness of my argument that Aristotle

is faced with a dilemma is independent of the question of whether or not

Aristotle holds properties to be tropes or universals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#20:1> Therefore, I will attempt to employ the neutral term " property"

rather than " universal" or " trope." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#21:1> The next step is to determine whether properties are immanent or

transcendent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#22:1> To claim that properties are immanent is to assert that they exist

wholly in space and time--that the world, which includes properties, isa

single spatio-temporal manifold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#23:1> ( Such a view is compatible with naturalism.) Immanent properties

must be instantiated ( in a particular)--there can be no uninstantiated

properties.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#24:1> It follows that the property x exists if and only if x is

instantiated in a particular.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#25:1> This position may be contrasted with a transcendent theory of

universals, as attributed to Plato 's middle dialogues.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#26:1> A transcendent theory of properties allows properties to exist

independently of their instantiation in any particular.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#27:1> Thus the property x may exist even if there are no particulars that

instantiate that property.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#28:1> That is, x may exist even when no particular is x. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#29:1> There is little doubt that Aristotle wished to contrast his

theory of properties with that propounded by Plato.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#30:1> And it seems farily clear, while not absolutely certain, that, in the

Categories this contrast leads us to conclude that Aristotle accepts an

immanent theory of properties.[2] </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#31:1> <h> 1.2 Metaphysical Predication</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#32:1> We now move deeper into Aristotle 's ontology and examine the

nature of the relation between particulars and properties.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#33:1> That is, we examine his theory of predication.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#34:1> For Aristotle there are two forms of metaphysical predication: a.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#35:1> the said-of relation b.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#36:1> the present-in relation</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#37:1> This amounts two metaphysically distinct manners in which

properties are able to be predicated of subjects.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#38:1> For example, both the property of man and the property of pallor may

be predicated of Socrates.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#39:1> Yet, each quality bears a distinct type of relation to the subject

Socrates.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#40:1> Man is predicated of Socrates by the said-of relation while pallor is

predicated of Socrates by the present-in relation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#41:1> These two relations combine in four possible ways, yeilding four

types of metaphysical entities.[3] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#42:1> a.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#43:1> Substantial individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#44:1> Substantial individuals are neither present-in nor said-of anything.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#45:1> Examples are Socrates, the individual man, Phar Lap, and the

individual horse.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#46:1> A substantial individual, such as Socrates, is not predicated, by

either the present-in or the said-of relation, of any subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#47:1> As such, nothing is subject for a substantial individual. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#48:1> b.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#49:1> Substantial kinds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#50:1> Substantial kinds are said-of something, but are not present-in

anything.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#51:1> Examples are species and genera; such as man, horse, and animal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#52:1> A substantial kind, such as horse, is predicated by the said-of

relation of a subject, such as Phar Lap, but is not predicated by the

present-in relation of any subject. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#53:1> c.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#54:1> Non-substantial individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#55:1> Non-substantial individuals are present-in something, but not said-of

anything.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#56:1> Examples are midnight black and pallor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#57:1> A non-substantial individual, such as the shade of color midnight

black, may be predicated by the present-in relation of a subject, such as

Phar Lap, yet it is not predicated by the said-of relation of any subject.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#58:1> d.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#59:1> Non-substantial kinds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#60:1> Non-substantial kinds are both present-in and said-of something.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#61:1> Examples are color.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#62:1> A non-substantial kind, such as color, is predicated by the said-of

relation of midnight black, and is also predicated by the present-in relation

of Phar Lap ( in virtue of the fact that Phar Lap is midnight black). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#63:1> It should be noted that the notions of substance and

non-substance, and both the present-in and said-of relations are undefined in

the Categories.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#64:1> Lewis points out that the notions of substance and non-substance are

specified in terms of the notions of metaphysical predication--in terms of

the said-of and present-in relations.[4]
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#65:1> At the same time, the notions of metaphysical predication are

specified in terms of the distinction between substances and non-substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#66:1> The result is that neither can be taken as providing a definition of

the other.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#67:1> Rather, Lewis suggests that we take both notions to be primitive in

Aristotle. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#68:1> <h> 2.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#69:1> Criteria for Primary Substances</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#70:1> Aristotle declares that of the four types of metaphysical

entities identified above substantial individuals ( such as the individual

man, say, Socrates and the individual horse, say, Phar Lap) are ontologically

basic and play the role of primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#71:1> Two criteria are employed by Aristotle for delineating the general

patterns of ontological priority and dependency in identifying substantial

individuals as primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#72:1> One criterion is predicative, while the other is existential. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#73:1> a.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#74:1> Predicative: that which is neither said-of nor present-in a subject,

and that which all other things are predicated of. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#75:1> b.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#76:1> Existential: that which is such that " if it were not to exist, it

would be impossible for anything to exist." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#77:1> This section examines the arguments by which Aristotle attempts

to use each of these criteria to establish the ontological primacy of primary

substances. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#78:1> <h> 2.1 Predicative Criterion</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#79:1> The predicative criterion consists of two parts: ( a) that which

is neither said-of nor present-in a subject, and ( b) that which all other

things are predicated of.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#80:1> The first part unequivocally picks out substantial individuals as

primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#81:1> Aristotle states that: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#82:1> A substance--that which is called a substance most strictly,

primarily, and most of all--is that which is neither said of a subject nor in

a subject, e.g.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#83:1> the individual man or the individual horse.[5] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#84:1> This clearly identifies substantial individuals as primary

substances, for the criterion for substantial individuals is simply the first

part of the criterion for primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#85:1> So Socrates and Phar Lap, as examples of substantial individuals, are

primary substances. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#86:1> The second part of the predicative criterion states that a

primary substance is also subject for everything else.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#87:1> Aristotle states: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#88:1> It is because the primary substances are subjects for all the

other things and all the other things are predicated of them or are in them,

that they are called substances most of all.[6] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#89:1> While elsewhere he declares: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#90:1> It is because primary substances are subjects for everything else

that they are called substances most strictly.[7] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#91:1> This amounts to all the other three metaphysical entities

identified above ( that is, substantial kinds, non-substantial individuals,

and non-substantial kinds) being predicated, by either the said-of or the

present-in relation, of substantial individuals as primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#92:1> A primary substance is therefore the subject in every instance of

predication. This second part of the predicative criterion for primary

substances does not alter the extension of primary substances as determined

by the first part of the criterion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#93:1> In other words, like the first part of the criterion, this second

part also picks out all and only substantial individuals as primary

substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#94:1> Despite the fact that this second part of the predicative criterion

does not alter the extension of what are to count as primary substances it

nonetheless has the virtue of identifying a further attribute possessed by

primary substances. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#95:1> The fact that a primary substance is the subject in every

instance of predication is accounted for by what Lewis terms the " monolithic

theory of predication."[8] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#96:1> An item is predicated of something other than an individual

substance only if, and only because, there is some individual substance of

which both items together are predicated.[9] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#97:1> Aristotle provides a number of examples: Man is predicated of the

individual man, and animal of man; so animal will be predicated of the

individual man also--for the individual man is both a man and an animal.[10]

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#98:1> And: Animal is predicated of man and therefore of the individual

man; for were it predicated of none of the individual men it would not be

predicated of man at all.[11] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#99:1> The predicative criterion succeeds in picking out a class of

entities that are to be considered primary substances, namely substantial

individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#100:1> But does the criterion give us any reason to consider this class of

entities to be ontologically primary?
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#101:1> As noted, the predicative criterion identifies two attributes of

primary substances: ( a) they are neither said-of nor present-in a subject,

and ( b) all other things are predicated of them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#102:1> It is hard to imagine how the first part of the criterion could be

seen as providing a quality that gives substantial individuals ontological

priority. In itself, the fact that an entity is not predicated of any other

entity provides little clue as to its relations of ontological dependency on

other entities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#103:1> The second attribute appears more promising.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#104:1> This is because, with its assumption of the monolithic theory of

predication, it is closely related to the existential criterion for primary

substances ( discussed in the next section) and makes substantial claims

concerning the relations of ontological priority. </p> </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#105:1> <h> 2.2 Existential Criterion

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#106:1> The existential criterion provides grounds for the ontological

priority of primary substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#107:1> It states that a primary substance is such that: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#108:1> If the primary substances did not exist it would be impossible

for any of the other things to exist.[12] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#109:1> This criterion picks out all substantial individuals as primary

substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#110:1> Given the existential criterion, the monolithic theory of

predication, and an immanent theory of predication, it follows that if

substantial individuals were not to exist, then it would be impossible for

anything else to exist. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#111:1> The monolithic theory of predication contends that all instances

of predication must involve a substantial individual as subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#112:1> For example, animal can be predicated of man if and only if both

animal and man are predicated of an individual man ( which is a substantial

individual).
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#113:1> In turn, an immanent theory of properties holds that a property

cannot exist uninstantiated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#114:1> That is, a property cannot exist if it is not predicated of a

subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#115:1> And non-substantial individuals, substantial kinds, and

non-substantial kinds are all properties.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#116:1> As a result, they can only exist on the condition that they are

instantiated in, or predicated of, some subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#117:1> And, as the monolithic theory of predication points out, this

subject must be a substantial individual.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#118:1> Therefore, it follows that if substantial individuals were not to

exist, then neither would non-substantial individuals, substantial kinds, nor

non-substantial kinds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#119:1> In other words, if substantial individuals did not exist, then it

would not be possible for anything else to exist.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#120:1> The ontological primacy of individual substances lies in the fact

that everything else is existentially dependent upon them for existence. </p>

</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#121:1> <h> 3.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#122:1> Problems--the Dilemma</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-008#123:1> While the existential criterion manages to both pick out all

substantial individuals as primary substances, and provides grounds for

considering primary substances to be ontological prior, it also manages to

confuse and muddy Aristotle 's ontology.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#124:1> This is because the existential criterion forces Aristotle to admit

that not only substantial individuals, but also substantial kinds are primary

substances.
<ICE-USA:W2B-008#125:1> And this runs contrary to Aristotle 's intentions and explicitly

stated remarks in the Categories.</p> </I>
