<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#1:1> <it> While narcissistic vulnerability is a central feature of both

normal and pathological development during adolescence, the author proposes

criteria to differentiate between them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#2:1> The specific features of the narcissistic personality disorders, as it

begins to crystalize in childhood and adolescence include: reliance on an

omnipotent sense of self, refusal to acknowledge shortcomings and

vulnerability, projection of disowned self-experiences onto others, and

demands for public affirmation of their power.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#3:1> Those clinical variations of narcissistic pathology-the

histrionic-exhibitionistic, the ruthless-psychopathic, and the

self-victimizing masochistic-are discussed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#4:1> These subtypes are illustrated with clinical examples. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#5:1> The confusion and contradictions imbuing the psychological world

of the adolescent are perhaps surpassed only by the formulations created to

explain them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#6:1> Psychoanalytic writings by Blos1 and A. Freud2 state that psychic

turmoil and regression are not just normative but are also essential for

healthy development.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#7:1> Such emphasis led Adelson and Doehrman3 to quip that, in the

psychoanalytic literature, the adolescent is depicted as " miraculously

holding on to his sanity, but doing so only by undertaking prodigies of

defense" ( p. 105).
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#8:1> From this vantage point, it is extremely difficult to differentiate

the normal crisis of adolescence from the pathological manifestations of

disturbed youth. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#9:1> Conversely, academic psychologists wax eloquently on adolescents'

relentless expansion of cognitive, moral, social, coping, and adaptive

capacities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#10:1> The view from the academic perspective reveals young people mostly

committed to a quest for truth, intolerant of adult hypocrisy, and feeling

passionately and intensely about relationships and ideals.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#11:1> Current theories fail to adequately encompass the paradoxes of

adolescence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#12:1> The study of narcissistic regulation and narcissistic vulnerability

does, however, provide a window onto the paradoxes marking normal and

pathological development in adolescence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#13:1> Better understanding these processes promises to illuminate a broad

range of clinically and developmentally significant issues. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#14:1> Perhaps like no other phase of fife, the passage through

adolescence bears the hallmarks of narcissistic vulnerability: a proneness to

embarrassment and shame, acute self-consciousness and shyness, and painful

questions about self-esteem and self-worth.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#15:1> How is this vulnerability different from pathological narcissism?
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#16:1> To answer this question we must first examine the phenomenon of

narcissistic regulation against the background of some evolving ideas about

how subjective experience is organized and structured. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#17:1> <h> <it> <bold> Motivational Systems, Internal Representational

Models, and Narcissistic Regulation </bold> </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#18:1> Over the past two decades, infancy studies4,5 have produced an

increasingly clearer and more coherent picture of the unfolding and

structuring of infants' and young children 's subjective experience and

intrapsychic reality.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#19:1> In particular, research has systematically documented the biases,

preferences, and predispositions built into the human brain; the motivational

systems giving direction to the organization of experience; and the tools for

information processing, memory, perception, affect, and arousal regulation

that become available to infants to construct their intrapsychic world. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#20:1> Although the views emerging from research support a number of

psychoanalytic ideas about early development, they also challenge many

assumptions held by psychoanalysts about the nature and content of the

infant 's psychic life.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#21:1> The creative tension between the prospective and normative view

evolving out of direct observation and research with infants and children, as

well as the retrospective and pathographic perspective generated by

psychoanalysis, offers a rich opportunity to enhance our understanding of

psychological development in normality and in psychopathology. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#22:1> Two intertwined motivational systems are particularly relevant to

a discussion of narcissistic regulation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#23:1> Infancy research amply supports Fairbaim 's6 seminal contention of the

primacy of the human craving for sustaining connections with others.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#24:1> Observation and research document a powerful tendency in the human

species to seek out and elicit engagement with others from the beginning of

fife, a built-in motivation for social fittedness.7 As Stern5 noted, neonates

are preprogrammed to recognize people, to prefer human stimulation above all

other, and to develop the behavioral repertoire of attachment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#25:1> Distress escalating to overwhelming anxiety and organismic

vulnerability follow disruption of the infant 's attachments."'
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#26:1> The weight of the accumulated evidence led Greenberg and Mitchelll2

to conclude that the search for two-way relationships and the need for human

reciprocity is as preemptory a human motive as supposedly more basic

biological needs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#27:1> Thus it appears highly unlikely that the pairing of human beings for

the gratification of biological needs is a precondition to the child 's

interest in relating to other humans.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#28:1> We are, as Greenberg and Mitchell12 explain, essentially drawn to

relate, endowed with a brain inherently wired to generate, organize, and

pattern psychological experience resulting from transactions in an

interpersonal context.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#29:1> The affective correlate of this perceptual-cognitive bias is

separation anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#30:1> KandeII3 has pointed out the likely innate neurobiological readiness

to trigger or downplay a fight-or-flight sequence of anger, anxiety, and

hyperarousal in response to the respective absence or reappearance of

caretakers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#31:1> Other humans, says Kandel13 evoke a built-in, ready-to-be-activated

signal of safety.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#32:1> One of the basic roots of anxiety thus appears to be a biologically

programmed tendency to respond to separations with anxiety and to reunions

with relief. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#33:1> Infancy research also strongly supports the existence of a

powerful built-in predisposition toward self-regulation and mastery, and an

innate tendency to create perceptual-experiential coherence and organization.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#34:1> As Emde7 remarks, the infant comes into the world " with biologically

prepared active propensities and with organized capacities for

self-regulation" ( p. 38).
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#35:1> Stern5 also noted an innate tendency to develop predictable patterns

and to connect in one 's mind what goes together in reality, as well as a

corresponding affective response of distress when organization cannot be

created or when the expected experiential coherence-the match between the

mental model and reality itself-is disrupted. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#36:1> The distressing consequences of a disruption in experiential

coherence were well described in Freud 's early writings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#37:1> Freud and Breuer14 compared hysteria with the traumatic neurosis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#38:1> In both instances, they claimed, an event had become pathogenic

because it could not be integrated into the dominant mass of ideas ( the

psychic organization that Freud subsequently designated as the ego).
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#39:1> Thus the experience in question could not be processed through the

normal psychological mechanisms and instead persisted, unmetabolized, seeking

expression through somatic channels. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#40:1> Almost 30 years later, Freud15 conceptualized trauma as the

experience of being overwhelmed by an adaptive demand that renders the ego

passive, helpless, and unable to anticipate, cope, integrate, and retain any

sense of control.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#41:1> According to Freud, the essence and meaning of the traumatic

situation consists of " the subject 's estimation of his own strength compared

to the magnitude of the danger and his admission of helplessness."15
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#42:1> As a corollary, Freud described the ego 's tendency to attempt a

turnaround of such passivity and helplessness in an effort to gain ( or

regain) a measure of activity and mastery.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#43:1> Freud believed that the tendency was critical to advancing the

individual 's most basic narcissistic pursuits, that is, the capacity for

self-preservation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#44:1> Freud 's ideas provide a framework for conceptualizing the

phenomena of narcissistic vulnerability and narcissistic regulation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#45:1> In contrast, however, to the opposition Freudl6,17 postulated between

narcissism and object relatedness, developmental studies point to an

intertwining of these two motivational systems.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#46:1> In Greenberg and Mitchell 's12 formulation, human beings are both

self-regulating and field regulating.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#47:1> We are, say Greenberg and Mitchell, fundamentally concerned with both

the efforts to create and maintain coherence, mastery, and organization <it>

and </it> with the efforts to create and maintain connections with others.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#48:1> More to the point, efforts to gain mastery, reduce helplessness,

and achieve experiential coherence coalesce in normal development with the

pursuit of relationships in a mutually reinforcing process.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#49:1> Sande18 and Ainsworth and Bell19 make the point that the infants'

competence is contingent on the presence of alert and responsive caregivers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#50:1> To achieve a sense of mastery and produce a state of experiential

coherence, infants can turn around their experience of passivity and

helplessness, brought about by adaptive demands-whether from within or from

without-only when they can signal and evoke attuned responses from their

caretakers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#51:1> The appropriate response, for example, to a signal of hunger

transforms the infant 's internal state from that of hunger-and helplessness

in the face of it-to that of satiation and a regained sense of mastery.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#52:1> Such transactional sequences certainly permit the restoration of a

physiological homeostasis, which reinforces the attachment system.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#53:1> They also provide the template for mental schemas of those episodes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#54:1> Stern5 describes how the infant 's abstraction of the common or

invariant features of those transactional episodes leads to the construction

of representations of interactions generalized ( RIGs) which are subsequently

organized into internal working models or internal representations of the

self in relation to others.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#55:1> These internal representational models ( IRMs) provide a prototype

for the sense of self as competent and worthy, and of others as responsive.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#56:1> Not surprisingly, disturbances of narcissistic regulation invariably

involve concerns about being ignored or not given attention, often coupled

with doubt about the ability to have an impact on or to evoke responses from

others.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#57:1> Given this built-in motivational push toward self-regulation and

object relationships, infants will almost inevitably- as soon as memory and

representational capacities permit-construct IRMs both to guide their search

for human connections more effectively and to anticipate reality 's demands.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#58:1> As the infants' representational competence grows during the

second half of their first year of life, they can utilize their IRMs not only

to anticipate but also to organize future interactions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#59:1> Stern5 and others have described the obvious shift in the " social

feel" of infants around seven to nine months.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#60:1> Not only are these children more likely to initiate interactions but

they also appear to " demand" specific responses from caretakers-that is,

responses that match their IRMs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#61:1> A representational mismatch20,21 may be a major precipitant of

so-called stranger 's anxiety,22 because the stranger does not match the

infant 's IRMs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#62:1> Yet again, object relatedness is intertwined with efforts to secure

control and experiential coherence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#63:1> Social referencing23,24 is evident after six months of age.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#64:1> When infants are confronted with a novel or uncertain situation, that

is, a situation lacking an IRM, they seek to resolve the uncertainty by

obtaining emotional clues from a caretaker.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#65:1> The representational match is established but mediated by emotional

information provided by the caretaker. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#66:1> <h> <bold> ACTUAL SELF, IDEAL SELF, AND NARCISSISTIC REGULATION

</bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#67:1> The growing development of categorical thinking and symbolic

capacity during the second half of the second year of life provides children

with an extraordinary new tool for achieving mastery, control, and

experiential coherence, ( i.e., narcissistic well-being). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#68:1> Children become increasingly capable of creating a mental

representation, which Joffe and Sandler25 call the " ideal self " This ideal

self is in the shape of a self-representation associated with a sense of

safety, competence, and satisfaction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#69:1> The ideal self conjures up the experience of mastery, control,

experiential integration, and optimal ability to meet adaptive demands.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#70:1> Such an " Ideal self" also transacts optimally with available and

responsive others. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#71:1> What are the building blocks of this mental representation?
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#72:1> According to Joffe and Sandler, the ideal self is a composite of: (

a) memories of actual experiences of pleasure, mastery, satisfaction, and

competence ( with particular emphasis on memories of the infants' successful

evocation of caretakers' responses that lead to a restored sense of

narcissistic well-being); ( b) fantasies about such experiences ( which

become increasingly more elaborated symbolically and more available to serve

defensive purposes); and ( c) the models provided by important people who are

loved, feared, or admired. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#73:1> An example of this representational composite is found in the

following vignette. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#74:1> <h> <it> <bold> Vignette 1 </bold> </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#75:1> A two-and-a-half-year-old boy protests loudly when his parents,

both busy professionals, leave on certain evenings to attend a professional

event.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#76:1> The parents, in attempts to comfort the child that are as driven by

guilt as by empathy, tell him, " We have to go to a meeting, dear, but when

you wake up, we will be back."
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#77:1> A few weeks later, the boy is happily tiding up and down the driveway

on his brand new tricycle.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#78:1> " I'm go 'mg to a meeting," he proudly announces to his father.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#79:1> Rather sheepishly the father replies, " Great, Johnny, have fun."
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#80:1> The father 's endorsement, however, only elicits the child 's scorn.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#81:1> " No, no, daddy..., " the child chides the father with exasperation, "

Cry!"
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#82:1> When the chastised father finally " gets it" and " weeps" in

distress, the child triumphantly says, " It 's okay, daddy, when you wake up,

I' 'llbe back." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#83:1> This vignette illustrates the use of a model as a blueprint, a

road map guiding the child 's efforts to reverse states of helplessness and

passivity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#84:1> He is no longer the one being left but instead is the one leaving.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#85:1> Rather than be the recipient of the comforting words, he is the one

attempting to soothe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#86:1> The mental representation of the object provides an internal model to "

match" or approximate. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#87:1> According to Joffe and Sandler,25 narcissistic vulnerability

results from the mismatch or incongruence between the ideal self and the

actual self, which is the conscious and unconscious sense individuals have of

their characteristics, capacities, and ability to respond to adaptive

demands.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#88:1> The tendency toward experiential congruity now encompasses both

external reality and the internal model of the ideal self. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-015#89:1> Narcissistic vulnerability refers to a painful state of

self-appraisal whose affective correlate is the feeling of shame.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#90:1> The prototypical affect of narcissistic vulnerability, shame reflects

the sense of deflation accompanying the inability to measure up to an ideal.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#91:1> Narcissistic well-being or self- esteem, however, results from the

successful shaping of the actual after the ideal self.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#92:1> Affects, as Emde7 has pointed out, promote the organization of

experience by providing a system of incentives and disincentives for

functioning both on an internal psychological level and on a social

interactive context.
<ICE-USA:W2A-015#93:1> Expression of affects also serves as a social signal that evokes

responses from others. </p> </I>
