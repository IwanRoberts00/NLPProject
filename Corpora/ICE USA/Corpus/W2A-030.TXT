<ICE-USA:W2A-030#2:1> <h> retinoic acid induces extensive changes in skeletal development

without conrurrently affecting the morphogenesis of the musculature in the

regenerating limbs of Ambystoma larva1.</h>
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#3:1> <h> Abstract</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#4:1> After systemic treatment with retinoic acid ( RA), A. opacum and

A. punctatum larvae regenerated forelimbs with a wide variety of skeletal and

gross anatomical abnormalities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#5:1> Yet the musculatures within the RA-treated limb regenerates were

normal even in instances where the cartilages were deformed beyond

recognition as components of the limb skeleton.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#6:1> RA is known to induce reduplication of limb structures, sometimes

entire segments thereof.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#7:1> When the latter condition occurred in the present study, the

corresponding replicates exhibited limb musculatures that were perfect down

to minute details, yet of opposite bilateral symmetry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#8:1> The data: *attest to the independence of myogenesis and

chondrogenesis during limb regeneration. *unmasked an otherwise hidden

potential within post-embryonic salamander limb tissue for manufacturing a

musculature of the opposite side of the body. *generate, as corollary of the

latter, the thesis that cells of the musculature of the limb regenerate are

descendents of developmentally uncommitted cells.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#9:1> <h> Introduction</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#10:1> In limb regeneration among salamanders, retinoic acid ( RA) can:

*distort skeletogenesis; *transmogrify the new part 's external form;

*stimulate the development of supernumerary cartilages ( and bones in adult

animals); and *promote the reduplication of entire segments - - fingers,

hands, wrists, forearms, arms and shoulder elements ( or toes, feet, ankles,

legs and thighs in the hind limb).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#11:1> ( See Maden et al 1985; Stocum and Thoms, 1984; Thoms and Stocum,

1984; Ragsdale et al 1989).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#12:1> This property of RA permits the testing of an hypothesis advanced

some years ago to the effect that myogenesis and chondrogenesis are mutually

independent during limb regeneration ( Pietsch, 1962a).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#13:1> The evidence for the independence hypothesis came from

experiments in which muscle differentiation was caused to vary while

skeletogenesis was held constant.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#14:1> RA permited the experimental formulation of the logical converse:

Given a changed skeletogenic outcome, would the RA-treated limb regenerates

muscles concomitantly change or proceed to a normal morphogenic conclusion?
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#15:1> The independence hypothesis predicted the latter alternative.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#16:1> While the opportunity presented itself, comparisons were made of the

muscle patterns within reduplicated members with a view to their bilateral

symmetry.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#17:1> The question motivating the latter was whether, among of the

post-embryonic salamander tissues, cells exist with an ontogenic potentiality

for manufacturing the opposite limb 's musculature.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#18:1> <h> Materials and methods</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#19:1> The principal experimental subjects were A. opacum and A.

punctatum ( maculatum) larvae brought into the laboratory as gastrulae and

monitored through the subsequent Harrison stages so as to insure ( by

appropriate culling) the developmental homogeneity of the animal stock.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#20:1> Ancillary experiments ( described below) were conducted with 35-40 mm

white ( non-albino) A. mexicanum ( axolotl) larvae spawned at the Indiana

University Axolotl Colony. Ambystoma are highly cannibalistic, especially

towards appendages.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#21:1> To avoid uncertainties about the stock ( whether prospective amputees

bore natural or regenerated limbs) and to insure a uniform starting point

with each experiment, prospective subjects were individually segregated, and

thus maintained, at Harrison stage 43 ( see Rugh, 1962); i. e., prior to the

onset of free feeding.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#22:1> The precautions in question were motivated by the fact that nerve

patterns in regenerated limbs are not identical to those in the natural limb

( see Piatt 1957).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#23:1> Nerves can influence regenerative myogenesis ( Pietsch, 1962b).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#24:1> All animals were kept in 5 percent Holtfreter 's solution, changed

daily, and daily were fed newly hatched brine shrimp.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#25:1> With a view, ultimately, to minimizing photic degradation of RA

in the test subjects, while at the same time maintaining a constant

environment for control and experimentals, all animals, except a special

control subgroup, were kept in capped amber bottles and were handled in low

intensity illumination ( after considerable preliminary testing of the

adequacy of the methods).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#26:1> The special control animals were kept individually in clear finger

bowls; they showed no differences from the controls in amber bottles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#27:1> Nociceptive procedures ( amputations and injections) were carried out

after animals had been narcotized in 1:5000 MS 222.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#28:1> A. opacum and A. punctatum larvae were 30-32 mm in body length when

subjected to bilateral amputation through the neck of the humerus, bilateral

in part for economy and efficiency but also for independently assessing

individual variations, as will be explained with results; the two limbs of a

given animal were amputated seconds apart and, in a given run, all limbs were

amputated within less than 15 minutes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#29:1> The plane of amputation, coinciding with the juncture of the free

limb and the body, was selected partly because it could be quickly and

precisely duplicated in a large number of subjects but also to involve as

much of the appendage in regeneration as possible. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#30:1> The principal subjects had a wet ( but blotted) body weight of

0.35-0.50 g at the time of treatment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#31:1> The amputated limbs were fixed and examined to confirm the plane of

amputation as well as to analyze the natural ( vis-...-vis regenerated)

musculature.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#32:1> Except for a group of untreated controls, the amputees received a

single 1.0 ul intracoelomic injection of either dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO) or

DMSO-dissolved all-trans RA ( Sigma XX), using a microinfusion apparatus and

operative procedures detailed elsewhere ( Pietsch, 1987).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#33:1> A single batch of DMSO, stored at room temperature, was used

throughout.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#34:1> ( Refrigerated DMSO crystallizes and redissolves with some

difficulty.3) Aliquots of one large lot of RA ( Sigma 104F-0135) were used in

all experiments, each aliquot having been stored preweighed and dry in a

sealed ampoule, in the dark at - 30 oC, until a few minutes before

administration.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#35:1> ( DMSO solutions of RA show major spectral changes upon thawing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#36:1> DMSO crystallization is sufficiently exergonic to drive redox

reactions among the retinoids.) The dosage of RA was 125 ug/g body weight, a

level estimated from prior data ( op. cit.) as the amount that, following

intracoelomic injection, would create a " treatment interval" of at least 14

days.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#37:1> Concerning the treatment interval, RA forms a bright yellow ppt

in coelomic ( peritoneal) fluid.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#38:1> Spectrophotmetric comparisons of this ppt with freshly dissolved

aliquots of its parent batch indicated that the ppt one observes in the body

cavity is indeed RA ( op. cit.).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#39:1> Thus, visible through the body wall, the yellow ppt is a positive

indicator of maximal intracoelomic RA treatment in progress at that moment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#40:1> However, to avoid exposing the principal subjects to the bright light

of the dissecting microscope during the putative treatment interval a

parallel monitor series was run with the aforementioned white axolotl larvae

( whose tissues are virtually transparent and whose green gall bladder

provided a highly contrastable background for the brilliant yellow of the

ppt); the right forelimb of each white axolotl was amputated through the

humeral neck and the retardation of the growth of its blastema was used to

guarantee efficacy ( op. cit. for rationale). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#41:1> Principal subjects were divided into groups with each animal

receiving a single treatment of either RA or DMSO at one of the follows days,

postamputation: 0, 10, 14 or 21 days.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#42:1> Two important sets of facts were taken into account in choosing the

subsequent incubation period.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#43:1> First, RA invariably retarded the growth of the blastema ( op. cit.),

often reversibly but sometimes permanently.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#44:1> Second, under the conditions of this laboratory, limb regeneration

among larvae of the age and species employed is complete in approximately 30

days.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#45:1> With these facts in mind, the principal subjects were kept alive

until either day 108 or day 114, post- amputation; i. e., incubation periods

of durations sufficient to allow for complete regeneration in the face of any

transitory effects.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#46:1> For sacrifice, animals were anesthetized in MS 222 and, when

unconscious, transferred to Bouin 's fixative. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#47:1> Specimens were first examined in toto under the stereoscopic

microscope.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#48:1> Then the entire limb, including the girdle, was dissected and

processed for paraffin embedding.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#49:1> The limb skeleton of Ambystoma larvae is cartilaginous, obviating the

need to demineralize the tissue for sectioning.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#50:1> Most limbs were oriented ( under the stereoscopic microscope) for

serial transverse sectioning though at least the wrist and forearm and, when

possible ( in the face of reduplications and distortions) the hand.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#51:1> After bending the elbow 90o, the upper arm was serially sectioned,

longitudinally in some instances, and transversely in others.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#52:1> Slides were stained with Mallory 's trichrome procedure ( after which

collagen appears blue and muscle tissue red).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#53:1> No species differences were observed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#54:1> Therefore, for the sake of simplicity the data from A. opacum and A.

punctatum will be combined for presentation.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#55:1> <h> Results</h>
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#56:1> <h> 1. Minimal Dosage Interval</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#57:1> In the white axolotls used to monitor dosage, the yellow RA ppt

was visible for some 14-17 days, during which time regeneration of the right

forelimb ( the bioassay) was severely retarded.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#58:1> Thus, considering the treatment schedule employed in the principal

experiments, no phase of regeneration escaped the effects of RA, when the

groups are considered collectively.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#59:1> <h> 2. Skeleton and External Form</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#60:1> The effects of RA on skeletogenesis were basically similar to

those reported in the literature ( see especially Maden et al, 1985; Thoms

and Stocum, 1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#61:1> Thus only an overall summary on the macroscopic findings will be

presented here ( see Table 1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#62:1> No regenerated limb of either the untreated or the DMSO-treated

control animals showed any skeletal abnormalities or distortions of

macroscopic form.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#63:1> Among the limbs of animals treated with RA on the day of amputation (

day 0 in Table 1), 62.5 percent showed external abnormalities; those with no

outwardly obvious malformations, upon subsequent histological examination,

without exception, showed some form of skeletal deformity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#64:1> With RA treatment at day 10, over 72 percent of the cases had an

external abnormality.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#65:1> Again, microscopic examination revealed skeletal malformations in the

balance of the cases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#66:1> All subjects treated at either 14 or 21 days showed macroscopically

visible malformations, and histological sections revealed additional

anomalies among the cartilages.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#67:1> In sum, skeletogenesis failed to reach a completely normal outcome in

a single RA- treated regenerate during the entire investigation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#68:1> Now considerable individual variation attended the types of

malformations, far more than had been anticipated a priori, the aberrations

ranging from syndactyly to supernumerary digits to segmental reduplications (

Figs. 1-8).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#69:1> Compound anomalies were not at all rare ( note Figs. 5 and 6).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#70:1> With one relatively minor exception ( see next paragraph), no obvious

correlation existed between the type of abnormality and the day of treatment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#71:1> That variability was not attributable to protocol was attested to by

the lack of correlation between contralateral regenerates from the same

animal ( with amputations within seconds apart and identical systemic RA

treatment): the regenerate of one side might terminate in a conical structure

while that of the other could exhibit two or even three forearms, wrists and

hands with varying numbers of fingers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#72:1> Or one side might show a two- or three-fingered hand ( the normal

number is 4) while the other might have two or even three hands, the hands

themselves with their own intrinsic abnormalities. ( See also Figures 4 and

5.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#73:1> The crucial point here is that the observed variability is a

function of the system 's response to RA.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#74:1> The exceptional condition involved hyperplasia of the shoulder ( see

Figs. 7, 8).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#75:1> All RA-treated specimen, irrespective of the day of treatment,

exhibited enlarged shoulders and supernumerary girdle parts were evident upon

microscopic examination ( Fig. 9).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#76:1> But with treatment at days 14 or 21 the proximal arms bulged

conspicuously and were macroscopically obvious in each RA-treated

specimen.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#77:1> <h> 3. Control Muscle Patterns</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#78:1> The criteria for the analysis of muscle patterns may be found in

Blount ( 1935), and Piatt ( 1956, 1957); see also Grim and Carlson ( 1974).
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#79:1> A brief summary description of the highlights of the natural limb

musculatures is presented here for the reader 's convenience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#80:1> Diagrammatic representations may be found in Figures 10-12.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#81:1> The girdle musculature was too complex for critical analysis in the

2-dimensional array presented by microscopic sections.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#82:1> However, distal to the insertions of the scapular and pectoral

muscles, sections of the arm, whether longitudinal or transverse, presented

three easily identifiable muscles ( using Blount 's terminology): 1. anconeus

( triceps), dorsally; 2. coracobrachialis, ventromedially; 3.

humero-antibrachialis ( homologue of the human biceps brachii and

brachialis), ventrolaterally.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-030#83:1> The small but constant and highly recognizable ulnocarpalis

muscle has furnished an invaluable landmark in cross sections of the

Ambystoma forearm and wrist for other investigations ( see Piatt, 1956; 1957;

Pietsch, 1961a, b; 1962a, b), and the present experiments were no exception.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#84:1> The ulnocarpalis runs parallel and ventral to most of the ulna and,

passing into the wrist, inserts into the deep fascia ( mesenchymal in the

larva) on the volar aspect of the middle row of carpals.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#85:1> Having identified the ulnocarpalis, the observer can immediately

distinguish the ulna from the radius ( otherwise impossible without serially

tracing), quickly pick out the obliquely oriented pronator quadratis and

confidently stipulate the flexor versus extensor surface of the forearm.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#86:1> The observer can then ascertain the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor

digitorum ( communis) and extensor carpi radialis, dorsally, and the flexor

carpi ulnaris, palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis, ventrally.
<ICE-USA:W2A-030#87:1> Muscles were analyzed in the serial sections of 4 untreated and 27

DMSO-treated control regenerates; each one exhibited the cross sectional

anatomy described in the previous paragraph for the natural limbs ( Figs.

13-16)</P> </I>
