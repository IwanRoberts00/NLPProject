<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#1:1> ONE THING just led to another, Mike Neely says when asked to

explain why he spent two years living on the streets of downtown Los Angeles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#2:1> A Marine with 13 months of Vietnam combat experience behind him, Neely

returned home bringing with him a problem with drugs and alcohol.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#3:1> " I lost my family and my job," Neely relates.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#4:1> " I ended up sleeping in a park near City Hall."
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#5:1> Then there 's Ralph C., a 57-year-old Navy veteran who served in the

Philippines and Japan during the Korean War.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#6:1> Ask Ralph how he became homeless 30 years ago and he says: " The first

two or three days you think it will be temporary.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#7:1> It becomes a couple of weeks, a couple of months, then years and you

are there," he shrugs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#8:1> Can't he work?
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#9:1> Ralph does work.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#10:1> He refuses welfare and won't panhandle as a matter of pride, so

he makes do for himself and his two dogs by handling odd jobs for the

merchants near the midtown Los Angeles parking lot he calls home.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#11:1> Across the nation, there are many more Mikes and Ralphs who live

in big cities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#12:1> Los Angeles, by most reckonings, has the nation 's largest homeless

population, but New York isn't far behind, and Chicago, Boston and the others

all claim their share.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#13:1> Small cities and towns also have their homeless and if you look hard

enough, " you'll find thousands of homeless 'll in the bushes" of rural

America," says Neely, who ended his own homelessness five years ago and now

is executive director of the Homeless Outreach Project ( HOP) in Los

Angeles.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#14:1> There are so many homeless that the streets of America last year

claimed more lives of veterans than Desert Storm combat did.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#15:1> " In Boston alone, 16 homeless veterans froze to death last winter,"

says Ken Smith, a former Army medic in Vietnam who is executive director of

the New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#16:1> " Nationwide, maybe 1,000 veterans died homeless, cold and alone.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#17:1> To me, that is very wrong," says Smith.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#18:1> <h> <bold> The Homeless: How Many? </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#19:1> Just how big is the problem?
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#20:1> Guesses range from the Urban Institute 's 1988 estimate of 500,000 to

600,000 homeless all the way up to 3 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#21:1> When Census Bureau enumerators fanned out across the nation one

night last March to count the homeless, many hoped this would end the

mystery.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#22:1> It didn't.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#23:1> The Census Bureau found only 228,261 homeless, but experts scorn that

tally.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#24:1> New York 's Doe Foundation, for instance, claimed that in one

116-block area of Manhattan, Census Bureau enumerators counted 378 homeless,

but Doe 's count was 1,649.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#25:1> In the end, the Census Bureau 's Cynthia Tauber conceded, " We will

never have a total homeless count."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#26:1> James G., a 40-year-old Vietnam veteran who 's been homeless for

four years agreed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#27:1> " I'm not counted, so I just don't exi 'm," he told <it> The New York

Times </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#28:1> He added the Census Bureau was not committed to counting homeless.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#29:1> " If they were, they would know how many people out here need

help."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#30:1> <h> <bold> Who Are They? </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#31:1> " The public 's perception of who the homeless are is distorted.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#32:1> They are not one type of person," says Elizabeth Bailey of Los

Angeles' Weingart Center, an agency that provides 600 beds for the

homeless.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#33:1> In that vein, while surveys designed to accurately define the

homeless population have been numerous, none has proved any more conclusive

than the attempts to count them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#34:1> It 's because many homeless people don't want anyone to know much

about them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#35:1> Perhaps that is why some experts insists that 25 percent of the

homeless are women with children, while others claim there are very few

homeless families.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#36:1> But one group about which there 's little debate is veterans.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#37:1> How many of the homeless are veterans? Around one-third, says VA.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#38:1> Independent groups arrive at about the same number.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#39:1> For example, veterans accounted for 31 percent of the homeless in a

1989 UCLA survey, while at Step Up On Second, a Santa Monica, Calif., service

agency, a month-by-month client tally for 1991 's first quarter found that 33

percent were veterans.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#40:1> <h> <bold> The Causes </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#41:1> Ten years ago, when homelessness first surfaced in the media,

many claimed that the cause and cure was housing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#42:1> No longer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#43:1> " The days of thinking there is one solution to homelessness--just

providing housing--are gone," says Andrew Cuomo, who runs New York 's Housing

Enterprise for the Less Privileged.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#44:1> Lack of low-cost housing, particularly in Cities, is a factor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#45:1> In Los Angeles, for instance, half of downtown 's single room

occupancy units were demolished in urban renewal campaigns between 1970 and

1985.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#46:1> But according to shelter director Smith, " There is no one cause of

homelessness."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#47:1> Al Peck, administrator of the 600-bed Borden Avenue Veterans

Residence in Queens, N.Y, agrees.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#48:1> " The assumption used to be that the homeless were people who had

suffered a streak of bad luck, losing their jobs and homes, and if they were

given a place to stay, that alone would solve their problems.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#49:1> That 's not the reality."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#50:1> Just what are the causes? Experts single out a handful of chief

reasons:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#51:1> - Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric wards is a primary factor

says Smith.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#52:1> Starting in the l960s and continuing to today, stale mental

hospitals, pressured by both civil libertarians and budget cutters, have

emptied their beds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#53:1> In 1955, those hospitals had 552,000 patients; today 's number is

119,000.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#54:1> Unfortunately, many have wound up on the streets.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#55:1> According to research conducted by Johns Hopkins Medical School, 40

percent of homeless men and about half the women suffer from mental

disorders.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#56:1> Experts haggle over exactly how disturbed the homeless are, but

Smith 's street-eye-view is that " at minimum, 15 percent of the guys we see

are pretty far gone.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#57:1> They need psychiatric help."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#58:1> - Substance abuse is another crucial factor, according to a

recent 22-city survey by the U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#59:1> Conference of Mayors, which estimates that 44 percent of the homeless

are substance abusers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#60:1> Peck says, " Over two-thirds of the men are here because of alcohol

or drug problems, or both."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#61:1> HOP 's Neely provides a personal case in point: 'My homelessness

was directly related to drugs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#62:1> Before I went to 'Nam I knew nothing about drugs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#63:1> Over there I experienced fear for the first time in my life and I

tried to counter it through drugs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#64:1> By the time I returned home, I was a very experienced drug user."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#65:1> - " Bad papers" or other than honorable discharges from military

service are another factor in homelessness, according to both Smith and Peck,

who open their shelter doors to all who served regardless of discharge

status.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#66:1> " A man comes in here with bad paper, maybe for smoking pot in

Vietnam, and he 's been living in shame since.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#67:1> It 's a chicken bone that 's been caught in his throat for years," says

Smith, who 's been honored as one of President Bush 's " thousand points of

light."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#68:1> <h> <bold> Helping Hands </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#69:1> Helping the homeless is not an easy mission.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#70:1> Brother Denys Cormier, founder of the Catholic order Emmaus in

Hartford, Conn., tells why.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#71:1> " In the Scriptures, Christ raised people from the dead.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#72:1> We don't have people in the Scriptures who refused to be raised from

the dead.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#73:1> But that 's what we're dealin 'reith some of the time."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#74:1> Pessimisin, in fact, is widespread.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#75:1> A 1990 poll by the Marist Institute of Public Opinion found that 76

percent of Americans think that the homelessness problem will remain as big

as it currently is .
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#76:1> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#77:1> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#78:1> or increase.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#79:1> Even so, there are optimists and Al Peek is one of them, but not at

the loss of realism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#80:1> " The homeless look at life in the short-term.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#81:1> Where will I get my next meal?
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#82:1> Where will I sleep? Many helping programs are short-term themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#83:1> They offer just a meal or maybe three days or a week of shelter.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#84:1> If you're homele 're you're not go 're to get back into society that

fast," Peck says.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#85:1> He says the homeless have burned all their bridges.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#86:1> The only way to get them hack into the mainstream is with a

comprehensive, bridge-building campaign.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#87:1> Peck 's numbers back him up.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#88:1> In the four years his Borden Avenue Veterans Residence has been open,

6,000 homeless veterans have come through the doors and " we successfully put

20 percent back into jobs and housing."
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#89:1> Peck 's program takes, on average, 18 months to complete but

apparently delivers a lasting cure.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#90:1> " They've finally 'vee it out of their hopelessness and want to get

on with their lives," he says.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#91:1> Ken Smith 's New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans boasts

similar successes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#92:1> In its first year of operation it returned 650 men to jobs or housing

or both, says Smith.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#93:1> Why are these programs working while many others aren't?
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#94:1> " We don't baby people," says Smith, who models his 125-bed operation

after Army boot camp.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#95:1> " We don't warehouse veterans, which is what so many programs do with

the homeless.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#96:1> Our job is to get them tough and get them out.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#97:1> We force sobriety on them and, then, we reinstill the brotherhood and

camaraderie every man felt in the service."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#98:1> Smith says that the last time many of the veterans felt personal

pride was in the military.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#99:1> " We remind them of that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#100:1> We get the man standing tall again, building on his renewed

self-respect."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#101:1> Much the same philosophy prevails at Peck 's shelter, " If you

don't want to give up drugs and alcohol, this isn't where you belong, " Peck

tells newcomers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#102:1> " We demand that you want to end your homelessness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#103:1> Meet just that entry requirement and you're in 'rend you're pr 'reded

with a personalized contract."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#104:1> Peck says the contract tells the veterans what they cannot

do--no fighting, no drugs, etc., and what they must do, from participating in

substance abuse counseling through job training.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#105:1> " Three violations of the contract and they're ou 're</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#106:1> Smith is convinced his shelter can save enough homelss veterans

and get them working again so their taxes will support the programs that

helped them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#107:1> " But, you know what keeps me here?" Smith says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#108:1> " I've had 'ven say to me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#109:1> 'I'd be 'd drunk 20 years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#110:1> Now I'm sob 'm.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#111:1> I got a job.' That 's the fuel that keeps me going."</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2B-014#112:2> <h> CHILDREN OF THE NIGHTMARE </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#113:2> Falling families, easy drugs and glamorous violence push

two-million kids to crime.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#114:2>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#115:2> REMEMBER juvenile delinquency when you were growing up?
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#116:2> The bad kids smoked in school bathrooms, shoplifted candy bars,

stole hubcaps and took hot- wired cars on joy-rides.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#117:2> The really tough teenagers fought with knives, chains and brass

knuckles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#118:2> " These young hoodlums," said adults, " are about as bad as kids can

get."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#119:2> Guess again.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#120:2> By almost any standard, juvenile delinquents in the 1990s are much

worse.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#121:2> " Today 's young criminals have more dangerous drugs in their bodies,

more dangerous weapons in their hands, and a more casual attitude about human

life than ever before," says James Fox, professor of criminal justice at

Northeastern University.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#122:2> " We're 'reeing a new crime wave in which juvenile offenders are

extremely violent and homicidal."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#123:2> In a single generation, juvenile crime has grown from a petty

irritation into what many people perceive to be a national menace.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#124:2> What was once the stuff of romantic Broadway musicals--remember <it>

West Side Story </it> - - has become a real-life horror drama.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#125:2> After stabilizing and even declining a bit in the early 1980s,

the juvenile crime rate is again on the rise.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#126:2> Juveniles now account for about a third of all serious crime such as

murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, arson and auto

theft.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#127:2> Nearly 2 million children under the age of 18 are arrested each

year.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#128:2> Teenage arrests for rape and assault are up 15 percent and 19

percent respectively, and the number of juveniles committing murder has

doubled in the last five years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#129:2> Teen-age boys--often the victims of their peers--are now more likely

to die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes combined.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#130:2> IN 1989, a national poll indicated that nearly nine of every 10

Americans believed the problem of teen-age violence had gotten worse in

recent years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#131:2> Frequently, the proof lies in the morning newspaper:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#132:2> - A 15-year-old New Hampshire youth--at the urging of his

teacher-lover-- murders the woman 's husband in cold blood.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#133:2> - Two teen-age boys in California take turns blasting three

female friends with a shotgun.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#134:2> The boys told police the massacre started with an argument, but they

couldn't remember what it was about.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#135:2> - A Houston boy, 15, rapes and murders a 66-year-old woman.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#136:2> - A roving band of boys beat, rape and leave a female jogger for

dead in New York 's Central Park.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#137:2> There 's even a new word to describe this kind of crime, " wilding,"

the wanton, unprovoked, random attack on people and property.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#138:2> In some inner cities, " wilding" has become a form of

recreation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#139:2> Increasingly, schools are becoming crime scenes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#140:2> Where once gum chewing and talking in class were major problems,

children now regularly shoot, maim and steal from each other and from their

teachers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#141:2> More than 47,000 teachers and 2.5 million high school students have

become crime victims at school, and some inner-city schools now have metal

detectors and conduct " bullet drills" along with fire drills.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-014#142:2> " Crime has started to affect the way schools operate," says

Gary Bauer, former U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#143:2> Undersecretary of Education.
<ICE-USA:W2B-014#144:2> " Frequently, the schools that fail to teach kids the skills they

need are the schools most riddled with crime."</p> </I>
