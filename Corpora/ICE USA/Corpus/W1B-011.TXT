<ICE-USA:W1B-011#1:1> <h> Dear Mona & Johnnie,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#2:1> I have had good intentions of writing this summary of Jack and

Lydia 's wedding to go with the pictures I took and get it to you for your

anniversary.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#3:1> However, I am only a day late writing this and I have only had the

pictures for a week.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#4:1> I will try to give you a brief resume of the wedding from my eyes as I

am sure you have already heard it from your kids.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#5:1> First group of pictures were taken at the " rehearsal dinner"

which was great.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#6:1> On the left side of the picture are the bride and groom, Mrs. Ford,

her son Scott ( who is a self-employed graphic artist in New York City, has a

10 month old son who looks like a 3 year old and a very nice wife who is an

editor), me, a friend of the family whose name escapes me, and Mr. Ford.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#7:1> On the right side are Jesse, Joe, Maggie, the best man, Abby Ford (

wife of son
#3), the daughter of the friend of the family whose name escapes ( she is a

nurse who works at an Indian Reservation in Arizona and is now attending

Midwifery School in San Francisco so she can deliver Indian babies).
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#8:1> Mario took the group pictures and when he stood up to take them he had

forgotten to take one of the price tags off his new Jacket and it was hanging

down from the armpit - - needless to say he got some kidding from the family

about his oversight.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#9:1> The next group of pictures were taken in the lobby of the motel

prior to leaving for the wedding.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#10:1> We all went to a great diner for breakfast that morning ( Mario is

sort of the organizer and would tell us all what time to be where ever we

were supposed to be) and I put it on the MasterCard so everyone thanked Uncle

Bob.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#11:1> Now a little human interest on the best man.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#12:1> He was very nice and he and I had coffee together that a.m. - - he

teaches high school and his father is one of 17 or 18 children and his mother

one of 8 or 9 - - but the interesting thing is he has 96 FIRST COUSINS and

when there is a wedding ALL must be invited - - you have a hall full of close

relatives before you can ask any friends.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#13:1> He lives in Quincy and met Jack while he was walking the dog. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#14:1> The picture of Jack in the shirt and tie was taken in Ford 's

living room just before the wedding and they were trying to organize groups

to have professional pictures taken, thus the grim look on his face.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#15:1> The picture of Lydia and her mother I took ( I can never get a job as

a professional photographer and you can see why) in the living room.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#16:1> The dress Lydia wore was her mother 's wedding dress - - candlelight

and the embroidery around the neck was sparkly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#17:1> The sign was on the side of the house by the walkway to the back

yard.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#18:1> The guitarist played soft Indian music prior to the ceremony - - the

man whose back is in the picture is Robert Ford, Jr., a cousin of Lydia 's who

is a Shakespearean actor with the Globe Theatre group in NYC - gave a reading

and was terrific.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#19:1> Prior to the ceremony Mario went and talked to a neighbor in back who

was sawing and hammering and asked him if he would stop about 12:30 because

there was going to be a wedding.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#20:1> He was very nice and did stop and never started again that day.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#21:1> ( Probably he was looking for an excuse to quit so he could go play

golf as it was a gorgeous sunny warm day).
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#22:1> The minister was a delightful young lady .
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#23:1> She had gotten married the previous year - her husband was the

Minister at at Methodist Church and she had gotten a job as youth director at

a United Church of Christ ( Congregational).
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#24:1> She was most enthusiastic and happy during the entire ceremony--

enjoyed her job.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#25:1> The picture of the group in chairs watching the ceremony is the 10

month old son of Scott ( he does look older than that, doesn't he), sitting

on his father, Scott 's, lap, his mother ( forgot her name, too), youngest

Ford son and his wife Abby, mother and father of bride and I don't know the

rest of them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#26:1> There is a picture of Jack, Lydia and the nurse on the Indian

reservation so you can see her better - - believe they are very close friends

of the family as she told me they were not relatives.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#27:1> The bald headed man sitting next to Maggie eating the lunch is the

Shakespearean actor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#28:1> The fellow with the hat at the table with us is Scott the graphic

artist and those men who had bald heads grabbed hats as the sun was super

strong that day.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#29:1> The wedding cake was a work of art - - highly untraditional and

DELICIOUS.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#30:1> ( I told Bob it reminded me of the volcano Bobby made in 6th grade

for the Science Fair).
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#31:1> Mario took my camera and took most of the pictures.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#32:1> Another amusing incident when I got the camera back I asked Joe ( who

still had his suit Jacket on) if he would put it in his pocket.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#33:1> He had told me at the motel the Jacket was old and he was about to

retire it ( I told him it still looked nice) and then he said that the Jacket

was so cheap it didn't have any pockets.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#34:1> We all had a good laugh because he had never pulled the stitching out

of the pockets and really didn't believe me until a few other people told him

the same thing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#35:1> That about covers the people pictures, but the last group are

ones I bet no one else took to show you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#36:1> I took pictures of the living room as a lead in to the pictures of

the basement.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#37:1> The painting was done by the father impressionist or whatever.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#38:1> Than the rest are pie India, all on display in the living room.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#39:1> The one statues in the corner ( 3) are Indian, the mask on a table is

African and Lydia 's father modeled it for us - used to spit smoke and fire

out of the mouth and worn by a medicine man.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#40:1> You leave the living room and go down the basement stairs and there

are 9000, yes that is right 9000 golf clubs in his basement.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#41:1> If he does not have a club it does not exist.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#42:1> Mario succombed and bought a bag - you can see it in one of the

pictures-- multi-colored and a set of irons from him.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#43:1> These clubs he buys and sells, but off the living room had had

another room-a study full of " collector 's club" - - valued at thousands of

dollars.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#44:1> I asked Lydia 's mother how she did her laundry as the washing machine

was off the golf club room in the basement.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#45:1> She told me she tells him the day before she is going to wash and he

has to clear a path for her.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#46:1> All in all we had a wonderful time and I really enjoyed being with

your family and the Ford 's are delightful.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#47:1> I finally got my car back - - Bobby flew down to get it and drove

it home.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#48:1> What a fiasco and it would take another page or two to tell you all

about that.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#49:1> We are leaving Wednesday for North Carolina so Bob can play golf with

Sal Morton at his Member-Guest.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#50:1> Marisa is flying up from Florida so we will spend a few days with her

and then be back here by July 2.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#51:1> Golly- - what happened to June.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#52:1> You are both in our thoughts and prayers and we hope things are going

better for you, Mona.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#53:1> Bobby and Donna have found a house in Monett to buy and it also has

an office building on the grounds - - perfect for them price-wise, too.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#54:1> Now they are trying to get a loan and Bobby has a few black marks - -

one of which is taking bankruptcy 5 years ago.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#55:1> I hope they can swing it - they are so excited.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#56:1> He also told me as soon as they had a home, they would start a

family.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#57:1> They have been looking for THE house for over a year and their

biological clocks are running out so they had better move in and get

started.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#58:1> <h> Love and hugs to you both from Taylorville - hope to see you in

August.</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#59:1> <h> Bob and Jill</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#60:1> <h> Dear Family and Friends,</h

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#61:1> As the time to mail Christmas cards gets closer, we thought we

would try something different this year to let you know what has been going

on with the Millers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#62:1> Several ideas came to mind right away, but the " Home Page" on the

World Wide Web and the 1-800 number ( " ...press one to hear John sing 'Home

for the Holidays'...") did not gain a lot of family enthusiasm.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#63:1> So we decided to take the traditional approach and draft this

informative letter.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#64:1> We are extremely blessed with a happy and healthy family for which we

have a lot to be thankful.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#65:1> Our children have provided us with much joy and pride as we watched

them grow this past year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#66:1> Nicholas, now 6, started kindergarten this fall.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#67:1> He really enjoys his school, teacher and classmates.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#68:1> His favorite subject is " dinosaurs" and likes to checkout books on

the subject every chance he gets.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#69:1> Bedtime is quite a chore for his mom and dad because some of the

names of the dinosaur species from his library books are not pronounceable

without an encyclopedia.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#70:1> Meghan, who will be 4 in March, has also started school this fall.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#71:1> She is enrolled in " Tiny Treasures" which is a community ed.

pre-school program in Shoreview.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#72:1> She also enjoys the fun at school.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#73:1> She is very interested in art projects which continue to consume the

interior walled surfaces of our home.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#74:1> Stephanie, now 1 year ( time does fly), is a very busy individual.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#75:1> She is never short of a smile and is very vocal.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#76:1> She enjoys goofing off with her brother and sister.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#77:1> They make a great threesome.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#78:1> This year has been one of excitement and change for Martha and I.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#79:1> After a 7 month leave of absence from the Shady Lake Park School

district, Martha decided to resign from her elementary teaching position.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#80:1> A very tough decision to make but one that has been well worth it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#81:1> She is very busy supervising the development of the three

aforementioned youth.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#82:1> She is also determined to complete and defend her Masters of

Education thesis in the coming year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#83:1> I have also changed job descriptions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#84:1> I resigned from [ - - - ] in November to work for an engineering

group that is owned by [ - - - ] .
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#85:1> We a redesigning chips ( Silicon not Potato) that will someday run

the Personal Computer on your desk.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#86:1> It is exciting work that I am enjoying very much.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#87:1> <h> We wish you and your family joy and hope this Christmas.</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#88:1> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#89:1> <h> Dear Friends and Family,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#90:1> This year was one of great sadness for us.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#91:1> It saw the passing of John 's mom, Rose, in September.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#92:1> Her struggle with cancer, however, will forever be overshadowed by

the memories of her life and the impact she made on all that knew her.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-011#93:1> Just like the stock market, our children continue to post

noticeable gains and impressive growth this year: Nicholas, now 7, has

entered the first grade which he enjoys very much.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#94:1> He is learning to read which is very exciting for him and for us.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#95:1> His most notable quote this year was " I know Grandma is going to

vote for Dole, but my Dad and I are voting for Lincoln."
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#96:1> Meghan, age 4, has really excelled this year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#97:1> She is involved in many activities that keep her busy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#98:1> She is in her second year of preschool, and is also enrolled in

various other activities such as swimming, and gymnastics.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#99:1> Her most notable quote this year was, " Here 's the deal, you read me

the story and I get to stay up a half hour later."
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#100:1> Stephanie, now 2, is also very busy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#101:1> She enjoys just about everything as long as it includes either "

Barney" in the title or is a shade of purple.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#102:1> Her vocabulary has increased dramatically and her favorite quote

this year was " I want to watch Barney!
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#103:1> " Martha has had an exciting year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#104:1> In the spring of this year, she successfully defended her Masters of

Education Thesis and obtained her degree from Hamline University.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#105:1> We are all proud of her accomplishments.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#106:1> She is active not only with her family duties, but finds time to

volunteer at Nicholas 's elementary school and participates in the Community

Violence Prevention Council.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#107:1> Her most notable quote of the year was " You watch the kids, I 'm on

break."
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#108:1> John has enjoyed the wonderful times spent with his family.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#109:1> He continues to work at [ - - - ] and enjoys it as well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#110:1> His quote of the year was " I don't want to see your pretty faces

unless the clock says at least 7:00 am."
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#111:1> We count our blessings this Christmas season and look to the coming

year with optimism and strength.
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#112:1> We hope you enjoy this holiday season and we wish you the best in

the new year. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#113:1> <h> HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#114:1> </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-011#115:1> <h> Love,</h> </I>
