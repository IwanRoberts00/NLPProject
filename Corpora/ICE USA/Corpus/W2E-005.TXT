<ICE-USA:W2E-005#1:1> <h> RACE AND CRACK</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#2:1> The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court Monday to review whether

black defendants are discriminated against in crack cocaine cases spotlights

a legal issue that has simmered for a long time.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#3:1> It even boiled over briefly this month in a flareup of violence at

federal prisons, including the facility in Greenville, Ill.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#4:1> The issue demands a closer look.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#5:1> In a legal analysis last year, U.S. District Judge Clyde S. Cahill

made a strong case for Congress to abolish an anti-drug law that imposes

relatively harsh sentences against crack cocaine users.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#6:1> His is the kind of reasoned advice Congress should have heeded in its

recent review of this law.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#7:1> Judge Cahill isn't alone in raising questions about the law.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#8:1> For very good reasons, the U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended this

year that crack and powder cocaine be treated the same for the purposes of

sentencing.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#9:1> Though the drug laws were aimed at kingpins and major traffickers,

those caught in the dragnet tend to be poor blacks and Latinos.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#10:1> They are prosecuted and jailed for possessing relatively small

amounts of crack.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#11:1> Nationwide, 96 percent of all crack-related prosecutions involve

blacks or Latinos.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#12:1> Anyone convicted of possessing even 5 grams of crack

automatically gets five years in prison.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#13:1> A person would have to possess 100 times more powder cocaine, usually

abused by middle-class whites, to draw a similar sentence, even though the

chemical makeup of both drugs is said to be the same Unavoidably, Judge

Cahill 's analysis raised the issue of racism.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#14:1> Between 1989 and 1992, he notes, only one of the 57 persons charged

with crack violations in all of the Eastern District of Missouri was

white.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#15:1> The presumption that blacks in the Eastern District are singled

out for prosecution is present, he argues, because the U.S. attorney 's office

has yet to explain the principles it followed in deciding who would be

prosecuted for crack offenses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#16:1> President Bill Clinton used part of an Oct. 16 race-relations

speech in Austin, Texas, to criticize the fact that black men were

disproportionately prosecuted for drug crimes in relation to their use of

drugs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#17:1> On the same day, at the Million Man March in Washington, the Rev.

Jesse Jackson and Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan also appealed for

a reversal of this unfair criminal-justice policy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#18:1> The Congressional Black Caucus later called this issue the first

test following the president 's speech and the march of whether society was

serious about rooting out racially tainted public practices.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#19:1> A week after the march, Congress provided the answer by voting

overwhelmingly to uphold stiffer sentences for those caught with small

amounts of crack.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#20:1> And Mr. Clinton decided to sign the bill.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#21:1> After praising the principles behind the Million Man March, many

in official Washington still seem to say prisons, not wider opportunities,

are the answer to social problems afflicting black men.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#22:1> <h> AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LIVES</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#23:1> Affirmative action programs were supposed to be among the first

Democratic-sponsored government policies that would be overturned by the

so-called Republican revolution.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#24:1> For very good reasons, Congress has refrained from wholesale

elimination of these programs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#25:1> The continued survival of most of them is due in part to intense

lobbying by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#26:1> Its efforts have helped to shift the debate away from bigoted and

anti-black rhetoric toward a more rational discussion of how affirmative

action works, why it 's needed and who has benefited the most.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#27:1> It 's no accident, for example, that the Leadership Conference has

spread the word that women of all races, and white women in particular, have

reaped most of the rewards of affirmative action in the workplace.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#28:1> Still, the issue clearly is certain to be a big topic in next

year 's presidential campaign.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#29:1> GOP candidate Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas has all but made sure of that.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#30:1> Last spring, he promised to add an anti-affirmative action rider to

all appropriations bills.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#31:1> Wisely, the Senate has spurned this backdoor effort to pass

legislation to suit the views of one misguided individual.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#32:1> The unsubstantiated notion among whites is that affirmative

action is giving minorities unfair advantage - as if the absence of such

programs hadn't given whites unfair advantage for decades.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#33:1> At any rate, Congress eventually may draft new rules for

determining who deserves special help.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#34:1> That seems to be the preference of the Clinton administration.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#35:1> Meanwhile, Sen. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri already is pushing

the same concept in connection with federal set-aside contracts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#36:1> He wants to limit them to businesses in low-income census tracts, on

the assumption that the firms would hire people from the neighborhoods.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#37:1> That premise is false for two reasons.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#38:1> First, federal contracts are no guarantee of job opportunities.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#39:1> If they were, Washington wouldn't need an Office of Federal Contract

Compliance.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#40:1> Second, just because a business is situated in a black

neighborhood doesn't mean jobs automatically flow to the neighborhood

residents.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#41:1> Mr. Bond and others need only look at the employment behavior of

businesses already operating in or near low-income communities.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#42:1> These range from Asian-controlled beauty supply outlets to foundries

to service industries in industrial parks.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#43:1> Many of them tend to give only token employment opportunities to

community residents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#44:1> Nor should Mr. Bond and others forget that black Americans who

live outside of low-income communities also feel the sting of racial and

economic discrimination.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#45:1> That fact suggests that society cannot avoid taking race into account

if it is serious about eradicating discriminatory policies.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#46:1> <h> BLACK CAUCUS' FOUNDATION UNDER ATTACK</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#47:1> You can bet something more than good government is behind the

attacks by Republicans and conservative Democrats on foundations affiliated

with various caucuses in Congress.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#48:1> One target is a

&dollar; 100,000 donation that Nigeria 's military dictatorship gave to the

Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#49:1> Critics say this is an example of why foundations should be

required to make full disclosures of their donations and explain how

foundation money is spent to support Congress' 29 caucuses.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#50:1> The

&dollar; 100,000 check, the critics argue, is an example of loose controls over

money and influence between caucuses and independent foundations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#51:1> In addition, some critics seek a law to forbid members of

Congress from serving on the boards of foundations of caucuses with which

members are affiliated.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#52:1> Rep. Alan Wheat of Kansas City happened to be the chairman of the

Black Caucus Foundation 's board at the time of Nigeria 's donation.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#53:1> He sees no conflict between his work in Congress and service to the

foundation, which, he says, has a

&dollar; 2 million annual budget and distributes more than

&dollar; 300,000 in scholarships each year and provides

&dollar; 200,000 annually for internships and fellowships.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#54:1> There was nothing illegal about Nigeria 's donation.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#55:1> Moreover the amount of money involved pales in relation to the sums

that lobbyists give to influence votes in Congress.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#56:1> The caucus' executive director, Quentin Lawson, points out that it

gets larger donations from corporations that have specific legislative

interests, such as giant tobacco firms.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#57:1> Yet, conservatives do not get upset about these donations.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#58:1> Nor are questions raised about donations from multinational

corporations that give money in part to influence the way Congress treats

foreign countries in which the multinationals do business.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#59:1> Perhaps these caucuses should open their books to show that they

have nothing to hide - assuming they have nothing to hide.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#60:1> But the public also should know there 's a lot more than questions of

clean government behind these attacks.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#61:1> They are an attempt to undermine a major means through which many

liberal caucuses have gained clout.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#62:1> <h> U.S. TROOPS IN COLOMBIA</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#63:1> Why are U.S. soldiers being sent to Colombia?
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#64:1> To help build a road, school and hospital.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#65:1> That 's the official answer.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#66:1> Congress should raise questions nevertheless.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#67:1> One issue is whether the soldiers are laying the groundwork for

an assault on the Cali drug cartel.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#68:1> It is the world 's largest, now that Colombian government forces have

killed Pablo Escobar and crushed his Medellin cartel.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#69:1> The Cali headquarters happens to be about 45 miles northwest of the

region where U.S. soldiers will be assigned.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#70:1> That the U.S. soldiers will engage in a road-building project is

hardly reassuring.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#71:1> Former President Ronald Reagan often sent units of the National Guard

on similar " humanitarian" projects.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#72:1> The roads, in some cases, were being built to accommodate military

vehicles.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#73:1> This mission could well be part of now-discredited U.S.

drug-interdiction efforts in Latin America.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#74:1> If so, it means the Clinton administration hasn't much of a fresh

anti-drug policy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#75:1> Drug cartels will remain plentiful as long as there is a demand for

what they produce.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#76:1> In 1991, this nation spent

&dollar;23 billion on interdiction and law enforcement programs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#77:1> These supply-side initiatives were undertaken at the expense of

much-needed treatment facilities and education programs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#78:1> Meanwhile, more and more people, out of frustration, are arguing

that decriminalization might be the answer.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#79:1> U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders got into hot water recently when

she sensibly suggested that the issue deserved study.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#80:1> Moreover, many Latin celebrities, including Colombia 's own Nobel

literature laureate, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, are calling for the legalization

of drugs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#81:1> Pointing to the crime and violent deaths that have been linked to the

illicit-drug traffic, these artists say other solutions should be tried.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#82:1> Mr. Clinton was quick to divorce himself from Dr. Elders'

remarks.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#83:1> Just as quickly, he should divorce his administration from failed

drug policies.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#84:1> If interdiction is the covert reason for the U.S. mission in

Colombia, then it should be halted.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#85:1> The dangers of sending U.S. soldiers on loosely defined missions on

foreign soil should be obvious.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#86:1> The time for Congress to ask some questions is now.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#87:1> Or, as usual, will it wait until a soldier returns home in a body

bag</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#88:1> <h> TO SAVE THE FISH, FISH LESS</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#89:1> The Atlantic Coast was once one of the great repositories of fish

in the world - home to enormous numbers of sea weakfish, sea bass, flounder,

blues, spot, croakers, shad and herring.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#90:1> No more.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#91:1> As a result of massive overfishing, catches of nearly every species

are down 70 percent or more in the last decade.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#92:1> Catches have fallen also along the Gulf and Pacific coasts and

Alaska.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#93:1> Congress has acted before to correct the problem, but its solution

hasn't really succeeded.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#94:1> Now it will try again.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#95:1> Just before Thanksgiving, Congress permitted a compact of states

on the Atlantic Coast to set tough catch limits and short fishing seasons.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#96:1> In 1976, Congress did the same thing under the Magnuson Fishery

Conservation and Management Act for deep sea fishing.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#97:1> But fishing close to shore went unregulated, and fish stocks there

are now the ones most threatened.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#98:1> Congress has now empowered coastal states to focus on fishing close

to shore.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#99:1> And this time there will be real teeth in their agreements.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#100:1> Because past efforts at uniform enforcement of fishing and

season limits have been defeated by lax enforcement by some states, Congress

will now permit Washington to enter the picture and enforce limits on states

reluctant to go along with the majority.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#101:1> The government is even empowered to declare a moratorium on

threatened species in uncooperative states.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#102:1> Fish experts say that the mandatory provision is essential and

that it has worked before.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#103:1> In the early 1980s, it was used to compel cooperation in restricting

fishing of striped bass in Chesapeake Bay.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#104:1> The species had nearly disappeared; now its population has

substantially regenerated itself.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#105:1> Catches are good again, though fishing is still controlled.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-005#106:1> Naturally, there is a price; the huge, efficient trawlers

responsible for overfishing will make a lot less money.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#107:1> Some in the industry will even be forced out of business.
<ICE-USA:W2E-005#108:1> That is an unhappy but necessary price to pay to stop the worst harm

of all to the environment: reckless overuse.</p> </I>
