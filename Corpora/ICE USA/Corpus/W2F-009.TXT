<ICE-USA:W2F-009#2:1> <h> MARK SMITH</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#3:1> Some people keep on smiling, even as their dreams are shattered.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#4:1> Other people never quite pick up the pieces.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#5:1> Finding your way between those two extremes might be the toughest

choice of all. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#6:1> " What do you mean you lost your wedding ring?" said Sue Davidson

to her husband Frank.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#7:1> Their car idled beside the arrivals curb at terminal B of Newark

Airport.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#8:1> Two minutes before, Frank had emerged from the sliding doors, tossed

his tidy suit bag into the back seat of their Accord, piled into the front

and announced without so much as a prologue that he had lost his wedding ring

somewhere in Washington, D.C.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#9:1> sometime during the last four days.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#10:1> Now he sat looking across at his wife, the thin angular lines of his

red face heightened by the crisp folds of his London Fog raincoat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#11:1> The bustle and excitement of travel which he brought into the car was

at odds with Susan 's mood. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#12:1> " Yeah, it was the damnedest thing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#13:1> Right in the middle of my big meeting with Thompson, I looked down

and it was gone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#14:1> He held his left hand up, fingers outstretched in a number five

gesture.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#15:1> Sure enough, there was no ring, though Sue fancied she could make out

the indentation in the skin of his finger as though he had just now taken it

off. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#16:1> " I can't believe it!" she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#17:1> " Well, you don't have to look like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#18:1> I didn't mean to lose it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#19:1> Frank had adopted the managerial tone he had acquired through years

of supervising large office staffs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#20:1> " It 's just that, well, I just can't believe you didn't notice

something." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#21:1> " Honey, do you, ah, think we could get going?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#22:1> I'm kind of tired and I'd like 'm s 'dwer before bed." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#23:1> Sue jammed the gear shift into drive and lurched away from the

curb.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#24:1> Instinctively, Frank glanced over his left shoulder to check the

traffic.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#25:1> Fine, thought Sue, he goes away for four days on a business trip - -

which seemed to be getting more frequent all the time - - and now he was

going to shower for thirty minutes and then pile into bed with a report or

some fat, slick trade magazine.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#26:1> No doubt about it, an hour after they got home he'd be snori 'd away.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#27:1> Never mind what she might want once in a while. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#28:1> " Strange as it sounds," he said, " I didn't notice it until I

was in that meeting with Thompson.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#29:1> I said 'Jesus, I've lost my wedding ring 'veand she said - - " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#30:1> " She?" said Sue. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#31:1> " Yeah.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#32:1> Thompson.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#33:1> Janet Thompson from our Washington office.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#34:1> I'm sure I've told you abou 'mher b 'vere." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#35:1> " Oh, well," she muttered.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#36:1> " I guess you did.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#37:1> Big fluffy snowflakes had started to fall, turning to water the

instant they hit the windshield just in time to be swept away by the wipers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#38:1> Sue felt her mind become clouded and jumbled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#39:1> Her emotions swarmed and crowded together like an angry, volatile

mob.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#40:1> Certainly she felt no jealousy about Frank 's meeting with this

Thompson.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#41:1> ( Was it some new business convention to refer to female colleagues

by their last names?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#42:1> It sounded so efficient and powerful.) He worked with women every

day.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#43:1> No, what really galled her was the thought of this other woman, well-

dressed, confident, successful, knowing something intimate about their

marriage while Sue whistled away in her fool 's paradise.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#44:1> She could imagine the show of sympathy and concern this hard-nosed,

corporate-climbing career woman had displayed while to herself she laughed at

the pathetic wife, off somewhere blissfully ignorant, powerless, forgotten.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#45:1> Frank kept on blathering: " She said, 'Well, you have to find it,

that 's all there is to it.' " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#46:1> " How kind of her," said Sue. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#47:1> " I thought so," said Frank. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#48:1> " So we got the check right away and - - " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#49:1> " What, were you at lunch?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#50:1> " Dinner," said Frank.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#51:1> " And I went straight back to my room and searched high and low.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#52:1> I even went back to the bar where I had stopped for a cocktail that

evening, and also the hotel restaurant.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#53:1> Nada.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#54:1> Of course, my room had been cleaned by then.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#55:1> I figured that if housekeeping had gotten hold of it, good luck ever

seeing that ring again." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#56:1> Good old Frank.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#57:1> When his pal Stan got caught cheating the IRS and went to that

country club prison upstate, Frank had been really pissed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#58:1> But when it came to hired help, they weren't to be trusted.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#59:1> To hear Frank, you'd think 'dhe blue collar of the world were just

waiting to steal the dirt out from under your fingernails, though there'd be
 'dlim pickings from Frank in that department. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#60:1> " So that 's it?" said Sue as they pulled onto the northbound

turnpike.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#61:1> The snow was coming down harder and cars had begun to slow down.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#62:1> The landscape had begun to take on a steely gray aspect, and the

mirror-like slickness of the pavement reflected the red tail lights of

thousands of commuters headed home. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#63:1> " What else can I say, honey?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#64:1> You know how much that ring meant to me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#65:1> I wouldn't have lost it for the world." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#66:1> He had dropped the managerial tone now and fallen back on his old

standby Mr. Charm voice that he had always used to such advantage, especially

with Sue.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#67:1> Frank could charm piss out of a snake when he wanted to. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#68:1> " But you did lose it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#69:1> I just can't believe it." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#70:1> " What do you want me to do?" said Frank.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#71:1> " I'm sorry, okay?
<I 'm-USA:W2F-009#72:1> I lost the ring.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#73:1> I didn't want to lose it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#74:1> It just happened.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#75:1> I'll get a 'llher, I promise." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#76:1> Case closed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#77:1> Debit recorded in the unrecoverable loss column.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#78:1> Dead letter file.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#79:1> Sue opened her mouth, then closed it again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#80:1> What more could she say?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#81:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#82:1> " Good thing we'll be ho 'llbefore the snow gets bad," said Frank

with forced cheerfulness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#83:1> " I hate to drive in the snow." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#84:1> " You're not drivin 'reFrank.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#85:1> I am," said Sue flatly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#86:1> They rode in silence the rest of the way home. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#87:1> Lately, Sue had acquired the habit of waking in the middle of the

night and wandering around the house poking into this and that, doing nothing

in particular.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#88:1> She told herself that she delighted in the pleasant perversity of

being awake when the rest of the world slept, but the truth was she felt more

comfortable and secure in the wee hours.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#89:1> Sue found herself increasingly overwhelmed with the small things in

life.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#90:1> She felt that she literally had to hold on for dear life as the Earth

careened through space.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#91:1> When the world was quiet and still and asleep, at those times and

those times alone, Sue felt like she was in control of something, that the

progress of time was slowed down to a speed she could manage. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#92:1> Also, the big modern house that Frank had insisted on buying over

her objections seemed cold to the point of being alien during the day.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#93:1> ( She would have preferred something more Victorian that she could

decorate with baskets of potpourri, stencilled wall paper and lots of duck

decoys and antiques.) But at night the house seemed softer and more

comfortable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#94:1> She poured a glass of red wine and wandered into the study and

looked until she found the photo album that had the pictures of her wedding.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#95:1> She took this into the living room, set her wine on the glass coffee

table and burrowed down into the deep cushions of their sectional sofa. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#96:1> Had it been ten years already?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#97:1> Of course, she had gained some weight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#98:1> How could she not?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#99:1> Sitting around the house all day.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#100:1> Oh, well she kept busy enough between volunteering at the library,

church activities, and with her friends.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#101:1> But there was no real need to work.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#102:1> Frank had discouraged it, in fact, not because he didn't feel it was

proper but because it screwed up their income tax bracket or something. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#103:1> She never had thought she would be a housewife.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#104:1> She always dreaded the thought of that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#105:1> When she met Frank she had just gone back to school to work on a

masters in psychology, but she never finished.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#106:1> Before that, she worked at a number of odd jobs that never seemed to

amount to anything. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#107:1> She found herself wishing idly for children, but the day for

that had also come and gone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#108:1> She married Frank when she was in her early thirties.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#109:1> There was still time then, and they talked about it often, but the

time never seemed to be right and year had followed year and here she was in

her early forties.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#110:1> Technically, she could still consider the possibility, but in truth,

the idea had stopped appealing to her the way it once did.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#111:1> If things seemed too complicated without kids, what would it be like

with?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#112:1> Anyway, she didn't want to be sixty with a child in high school.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#113:1> As she stared one by one at the pictures, a thought began to

present itself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#114:1> Not a new thought to her, but expressed with more clarity and force

than before: it wasn't supposed to be this way.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#115:1> She had agreed to a different set of conditions ten years before.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#116:1> She had signed onto a different agenda.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#117:1> Frank was a business major who was going to make enough to keep them

fed and clothed and spend the rest of his time playing bass with a rock and

roll band that he and his friends kept trying to start.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#118:1> That dream lasted exactly one month and one gig and then fell to

pieces when Interworld had called and recruited him straight from college.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#119:1> " Still up?" said Frank from the hall door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#120:1> He stood in his pajamas and robe, well-dressed even in the middle of

the night.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#121:1> He squinted into the lighted room, his eyes adjusting to the light.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#122:1> " Up again," Sue answered.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#123:1> She took a sip of the wine.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#124:1> The crystal was cold against her lips, but the wine felt round and

warm as it rolled across her tongue.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#125:1> She expected Frank would turn and go back to bed, but instead he

crossed the white pile carpet and settled beside her on the sofa.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#126:1> Why did he seem to be growing thinner over the years as she grew

more plump?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#127:1> The question mystified more than annoyed her. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#128:1> " I'm sorry about t 'm ring," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#129:1> " Oh, it 's okay.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#130:1> I made too much of it." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#131:1> " No you didn't.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#132:1> It was stupid of me." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#133:1> " Let 's not talk about it anymore," she said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#134:1> After a moment she said, " Frank?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#135:1> " Hmmm?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#136:1> " Let 's get in the car and drive." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#137:1> He looked surprised.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#138:1> " Where do you want to go?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#139:1> " Nowhere in particular.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#140:1> Everywhere.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#141:1> Don't you remember when we used to talk about driving across the

country?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#142:1> Let 's do it now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#143:1> We could go down south.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#144:1> I've never b 've down there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#145:1> It 's slower and calmer there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#146:1> We won't take any interstates, just country roads.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#147:1> We'll 'llp at every general store and main street diner we come to.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#148:1> We'll 'llz into each town, buy postcards and buzz out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#149:1> We'll 'lly in tacky tourist courts and stop at the historical

markers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#150:1> We'll 'llto McDonald 's and buy two coffees, fill up the thermos and

then get refills for the road." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#151:1> Sue became animated as she talked, but Frank just forced a thin

half smile and said, " You're 'reding, right?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#152:1> " No," said Sue, shaking her head.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#153:1> " I'm n 'm." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#154:1> " But, honey.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#155:1> I have a job.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#156:1> I couldn't just walk out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#157:1> I have appointments.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#158:1> I have at least ten clients coming in this week.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#159:1> I' 'dlove to take a vacation.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#160:1> Really.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#161:1> How about next summer?
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#162:1> I'l 'llut in a leave request now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#163:1> But not on the spur of the moment." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#164:1> Sue nodded and took another sip from her wine.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#165:1> For no good reason, she felt a sudden and overwhelming urge to ask

her husband if he had slept with anyone else since they were married.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#166:1> She fought down the urge.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#167:1> Partly because she had made a promise to herself years before that

she would never ask.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#168:1> Partly because she knew the answer would depress her no matter what

it was.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#169:1> But mostly she realized that to even want to ask the question at all

meant that some profound circumstance had changed in a way that made the

answer irrelevant. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#170:1> She nodded again and said, " Yeah, maybe in the summer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#171:1> It 's too cold now anyway." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#172:1> The next morning, after Sue had dropped Frank at the station to

join the other commuters who stood hunched in their long, thick clothes on

the platform, their breath turning into tiny clouds in the frozen air, she

went home and packed an overnight bag. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-009#173:1> She made a pot of coffee and took it to the kitchen table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#174:1> She gathered up paper and a pen and sat at the table under a heart

carved in the high-backed, Dutch-style bench, the most old-fashioned

furnishing in the house and her favorite place to sit.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#175:1> She drank coffee and wrote a note to Frank.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#176:1> She wrote that she was leaving and taking the car.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#177:1> He 'd get along without it and seldom drove it anyway.
<ICE-USA:W2F-009#178:1> She also wrote that she would probably be back, though as she did,

she wondered if this were true. </p> </I>
