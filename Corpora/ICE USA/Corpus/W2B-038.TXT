<ICE-USA:W2B-038#1:1> <h> Introduction</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#2:1> As the World Wide Web begins to outgrow its academic and

scientific beginnings, the limitations of its standard language, HTML (

HyperText Markup Language) become more evident.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#3:1> The Web has grown considerably and stands to become a powerful if not

dominant medium of mass communication.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#4:1> If this is to happen, the Web must be able to effectively compete with

its mass-media counterparts: television, radio, and print-media.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#5:1> To do this, the needs of creative people-- designers, artists,

musicians, must be taken into account.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#6:1> We should ask " how do the tools of traditional media content creators

differ from those of the Web designer?"
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#7:1> One answer is that theirs are powerful and creativetools - - which

allow the creative process to work unimpeded.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#8:1> Simply said, what they need is the flexibility to create what they

imagine, and the ability to do that in the way they choose.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#9:1> All this with a reasonable assurance that their creations can

experienced as intended by their public.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#10:1> Solutions will have to be radical, but not in the traditional sense.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#11:1> It is important to realize that, in terms of the end user, the best

Web content these days is designed rather that 'programmed'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#12:1> If one understands this difference, one can see how primitive current

Web design tools actually are. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#13:1> However, designers and artists are not the only people creating

content for the Web.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#14:1> It should be noted that the Web is a highly powerful tool in the

scientific and academic community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#15:1> There, the considerations of textual structure are the first

priority.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#16:1> Furthermore, Web content creation should be accessable to those with

minimal computer literacy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#17:1> The popularity of the Web can be at least partly attributed to the

easy in which the average person can learn and use HTML.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#18:1> Therefore, a language should be available that does not require

extensive understanding of computers or the working of the Internet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#19:1> In answering the demands of the these, often disparate camps of

content creators, I have outlined some preliminary ideas for a new 'meta-lan 'mage'

for the World Wide Web.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#20:1> This new language would in itself provide few additional functions,

but rather offer an umbrella under which the present language tools could

work cooperatively, establishing certain norms ( keywords) through which

language components could interact.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#21:1> I wish only to suggest guidelines for constructing a meta-language -

- principles which should guide any implementation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#22:1> The details of a meta-language specification are beyond the scope of

this initial proposal. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#23:1> <h> The Present Situation: The Nature of HTML</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#24:1> To understand the limitations of HTML, it is important to first

understand its central principle: markup.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#25:1> Markup is a codified way of delineating the structure of a text

document, in such a way that it can be displayed reasonably across a variety

of platforms.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#26:1> Its first considerations are: " what information is important?"
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#27:1> and " what are the structural relationships?".
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#28:1> Once this is 'marked', 'mhe browser software is left to decide how

best to display the document onscreen.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#29:1> The great majority of functions available in HTML are geared to these

structural considerations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#30:1> Because of this, HTML is inherently text-dependent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#31:1> This means, from the designer 's point of view, he or she must first

confront the text; its quantitative and structural qualities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#32:1> Images, or other non-text material are almost always the second

priority - - an afterthought.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#33:1> To add multimedia, the Web-designer must inevitably rely on various

tricks and improvisations, only to be then unsure of how the final product

will appear to the end user.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#34:1> If this is compared with television or print media, one sees that it

is an unacceptable situation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#35:1> Take the example of television news, which increasingly use Web-style

informational presentation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#36:1> The combination of multimedia with text based visuals is essential to

their presentation - - images and text are, at least in design, on equal

footing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#37:1> And even though the variety of television receivers is wide, the

producer can always be sure that his or her information will be reproduced in

tact, barring physical defects in the receiver itself, and broadcast

artifacts.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#38:1> This is because television has the advantage of uniformly adopted

industry standards, on which designers can rely.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#39:1> One such standard is NTSC video, which despite its significant

shortcomings, provides a fixed pixel area ( 645x486), guaranteeing proper

image proportion on every set.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#40:1> While this may seem trivial, it does assure the content designer that

his product can be similarly reproduced by a variety of receivers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#41:1> This gives the television designer a kind of creative flexibility not

available to the Web-designer ( yet).
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#42:1> It 's also no secret that television exceeds the Web in popularity and

social influence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#43:1> The Web can do this and much more if those who create content have

the tools that allow their creativity to flourish.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#44:1> While this will eventually be accomplished by software in which the

underlying code is transparent to the user, the first step is to have the

code resources in place which embody the principles necessary for the

multimedia Web to gel. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#45:1> <h> HTML and Multimedia</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#46:1> Every successive HTML spec has included more multimedia

functionality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#47:1> This will no doubt continue.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#48:1> But, the problem of the media/text schism remains if multimedia is

addressed through HTML alone.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#49:1> There, multimedia is treated as an extraneous 'element' - - a

separate entity from the text.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#50:1> While in HTML thorough consideration has been given for textual

structure, no 'markup 'msystems exist for multimedia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#51:1> No language is available that considers text and non-text material as

theoretically equal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#52:1> For example, in HTML it is easy to describe the title and important

subjects in a text passage:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#53:1> <title> This is the title</title></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#54:1> <h1> This is important</h1></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#55:1> <h2> This is kinda important</h2></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#56:1> What I told you is pretty important, but please don't forget <b>

this. </b> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#57:1> This is simple enough, but how would you describe to a HTML

interpreter, " take the red parts of image A and mix them selectively with

the white parts in image B only if the mouse is in the upper righthand corner

of the screen"?
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#58:1> It is of course possible, but extremely inconvenient and error prone.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#59:1> Part of the problem is that HTML instructions are given in a

linear fashion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#60:1> The interpreter receives a start tag <tag> and formats the text in

the specified way until is receives an end tag </tag> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#61:1> There are exceptions to this, but the core of HTML thinking remains

based on linear code interpretation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#62:1> However, multimedia often doesn't fit this linear model.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#63:1> It may seem that video and music are simple progressions from

beginning to end - - in the old paradigm this is certainly the case.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#64:1> But the Web is, or should be, interactive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#65:1> The Web allows for interactive multimedia on a scale never before

thought of.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#66:1> It is the Web 's single most attractive feature.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#67:1> Just as hypertext changed the way a reader experiences text, Web

multimedia will alter time-based notions such as plot and timing beyond

recognition.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#68:1> A language which proceeds from a linear viewpoint will never allow

multimedia to reach this goal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#69:1> Without multimedia, the Web will remain largely the toy of a vertical

market. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#70:1> Artistic creation rarely follows a clear line.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#71:1> For the artist/designer HTML with its linear nature is a considerable

impediment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#72:1> It forces the artist to create a visual object ( the page) in a

linear manner : " ok, we have blue text until here, then a GIF 100x150

pixels, then back to text, and that word should be in italics."
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#73:1> Even though one might create parts of a page in a non-linear way, one

sees from the example that the smallest building blocks are lines ,

interpreted from left to right.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#74:1> A painter would think, " a house is in the foreground, the sun is

above it to the left".
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#75:1> Or better yet, " the moving clouds cause the color of the light on

the house to change".
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#76:1> For him it is mostly unimportant which part of the image is seen

first by the viewer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#77:1> In this way, the painting is non-linear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#78:1> The painter can work this way not only because of his tools, but the

idea behind the tools.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#79:1> The simple analogy of brush-paint-canvas is based on the principle

that ideas are created and perceived non-linearly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#80:1> That means that the painter is not constrained when choosing a color,

and may freely choose any spot on the canvas on which to paint.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#81:1> Everything is 'random-access'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#82:1> This a model that should emulated when constructing a language for

the multimedia Web. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#83:1> <h> The Present Situation: Content Creation</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#84:1> So, we have seen that there are ( at least) two fundamental steps

in current Web-design practice: 1) understand the nature of the text

material, and then 2) 'attach' images and multimedia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#85:1> This schism comes from text-oriented style of HTML, and is

essentially harmful to the creative process.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#86:1> Creativity thrives under flexibility.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#87:1> Art is at its most effective when the artist proceeds from a 'total

picture'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#88:1> The Web-designer today finds it difficult to get a 'total picture'

because they are busying themselves with understanding the textual structure

of individual documents, when their time could be more fruitfully spent

constructing the Web site as a unified whole.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#89:1> Understanding the content is the job of the content creator not the

Web designer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#90:1> Very often today these roles are played by the same person.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#91:1> Returning to television again, one finds there a very clear division

between the creator of the content and those charged to give it form.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#92:1> This is perhaps due to television 's relative maturity as a medium.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#93:1> Concerns over content presentation are the subject of a ongoing

and often bitter discussion on USENET groups.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#94:1> Discussion has usually degenerated into political sparring between

two camps, the 'programmer' and the 'des 'dner'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#95:1> Due to this, comprehensive solutions have not been forthcoming.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#96:1> We have fragmentary stopgap measures instead.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#97:1> A considerable impediment in this area has been the concern over

interoperability.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#98:1> Often those in the 'programmer' camp have maintained that full

control of multimedia and presentation would limit the available target

platforms.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#99:1> Working with today 's tools, this is a almost certainly a true

assertion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#100:1> For example, I have often wanted to take advantage of Shockwave or

QuickTime VR, but have always been held back by my doubts over the

penetration of those technologies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#101:1> Ideally, available tools should have near 100&percent; coverage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#102:1> Today, the only possibilities are plug-ins and browser specific

enhancements. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#103:1> Plug-ins are inherently unreliable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#104:1> First, they depend on the user 's awareness of its existence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#105:1> This situation has been partially addressed by some browsers, where

one receives the message " this page contains media type xxx/xxx which can

only be viewed with the appropriate plug-in. .. " , then one can choose to

download the plug-in or view the page without it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#106:1> This often involves a lengthy download, then time to install the

plug-in, a process which can often include downloading still more components

- - it is far from a direct process, so much so that one often forgets the

page that needed the plug-in in the first place.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#107:1> And even once the plug-in is installed, the designer cannot be

assured that the plug-in will be properly installed and configured ( VRML

plug-ins leap to mind here).
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#108:1> As an architecture, plug-ins are naturally attractive; they have

been successful in a range of other software environments where

interoperability is not mission-critical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#109:1> But plug-ins do not meet the needs of creative Web-design, or

dynamic content delivery, as their distribution model cannot provide a

reasonable installed base guarantee.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#110:1> I do not mean to condemn plug-ins outright; in certain applications

such as intranets, they provide an ideal solution.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#111:1> In this transition period, plug-in architecture has allowed a great

deal of healthy experimentation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#112:1> But if we think in terms of a Internet-wide solution scalable with

increasing multimedia saturation, the weaknesses of plug-ins become evident.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-038#113:1> Also, while not exactly plug-ins, platform independent

client-side scripting languages such as Java/JavaScript and Active X can be

included here.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#114:1> The addition of client-side scripting has been a powerful addition

to the designer/programmers toolset.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#115:1> However, client-side scripting shares the plug-in problem because it

is dependent on class-libraries which often suffer from poor and inconsistent

implementation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#116:1> This situation could no doubt improve in time; until there were true 'standard

libraries', such as we have with the conventional object oriented languages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#117:1> But to do this would mean compromising platform portability, since

the libraries are client-side, they make calls to functions of the user 's own

machine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#118:1> Of course, class-libraries are ported along with the browser for

different platforms, but seen as a whole, the resulting libraries are so

inconsistent that they cannot be really suitable for platform-independent

applications.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#119:1> For simple functions this is not necessarily a problem.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#120:1> Simple data types, small data sets and calculations can all be

expected to function with reasonable consistency across different client-side

implementations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#121:1> But the future of the Web is multimedia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#122:1> The more diverse the mix of media is within the browser space, the

more difficult it becomes to control within the framework of the current

client-side scripting languages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#123:1> Multimedia will be a vital concern when ( and if) push-media reaches

critical mass.
<ICE-USA:W2B-038#124:1> With that kind of diversity, the inherent limitations of

class-library implementations will be unworkable. </p> </I>
