<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#2:1> Warning: Recent changes in the retirement earnings test have

affected this publication.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#3:1> We are revising it to reflect the provisions of the new law.

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#5:1> Why We Hope You Will Read This Booklet </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#6:1> The loss of the family wage earner can be devastating to the

survivors.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#7:1> This is an explanation of the benefits Social Security can provide for

the family.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#8:1> This booklet is divided into two sections. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#9:1> If you are working, the first part tells you what kind of

survivors benefits your tax dollars are paying for and how those benefits are

earned. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#10:1> If someone in your family has died, the second part explains how

to sign up for Social Security benefits and what you need to know after

benefits start.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#11:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#12:1> Please Note: This booklet provides a general overview of Social

Security survivors benefits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#13:1> The information it contains is not intended to cover all provisions

of the law.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#14:1> For specific information about your case, contact Social

Security.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#15:1> Many people think of Social Security as a retirement program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#16:1> But, retirement benefits are just one part of the Social Security

program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#17:1> Some of the Social Security taxes you pay go toward survivors

insurance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#18:1> In fact, the value of the survivors insurance you have under Social

Security is probably more than the value of your individual life

insurance.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#19:1> When someone who has worked and paid into Social Security dies,

survivor benefits can be paid to certain family members.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#20:1> These include widows, widowers ( and divorced widows and widowers),

children, and dependent parents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#21:1> You, along with millions of other people, earn survivors

insurance by working and paying Social Security taxes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#22:1> Right now, 98 out of every 100 children could get benefits if a

working parent should die.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#23:1> In fact, Social Security pays more benefits to children than any

other federal program.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#24:1> <h> How You Earn Survivors Benefits </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#25:1> When you die, certain members of your family may be eligible for

survivors benefits if you worked, paid Social Security taxes and earned

enough " credits." You can earn a maximum of four credits each year.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#26:1> The number of credits you need depends on your age when you die.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#27:1> The younger a person is, the fewer credits he or she needs to have

family members be eligible for survivors benefits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#28:1> But nobody needs more than 40 credits ( 10 years of work) to be

eligible for any Social Security benefits.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#29:1> Under a special rule, benefits can be paid to your children and

your spouse who is caring for the children, even though you don't have the

number of credits needed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#30:1> They can get benefits if you have credit for one and one half years

of work in the three years just before your death.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#31:1> There is a special one-time payment of

&dollar;255 that can be made when you die if you have enough work " credits." This

payment can be made only to your spouse or minor children if they meet

certain requirements.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#32:1> <h> Benefits for Surviving Divorced Spouses </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#33:1> If you've been divorced, your f 'veer wife or husband can get

benefits under the same circumstances as your widow or widower if your

marriage lasted 10 years or more.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#34:1> Your former spouse, however, does not have to meet the

length-of-marriage rule if she or he is caring for your child who is under 16

or disabled and who is also getting benefits on your Social Security record.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#35:1> The child must be your former spouse 's natural or legally adopted

child.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#36:1> Benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse who is age 60 or

older ( 50-60 if disabled) will not affect the benefit rates for other

survivors getting benefits.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#37:1> <h> How Much Are Benefits? </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#38:1> How much your family can get from Social Security depends on your

average lifetime earnings.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#39:1> That means the higher your earnings, the higher their benefits will

be.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#40:1> If you would like to get an estimate of the Social Security

survivors benefits that could be paid to your family, call or visit us to ask

for a Form SSA-7004 ( Request for Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate

Statement.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#41:1> Within four to six weeks after you complete and return the form

to us, you will receive a statement showing an estimate of survivors benefits

that could be paid, as well as an estimate of retirement and disability

benefits and other important information.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#42:1> There 's no charge for this service.

<ICE-USA:W2D-007#44:1> <h> Part 2-If A Loved One Has Died ... What You Need To Know About

Survivors Benefits </h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#45:1> <h> How To Apply For Benefits</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#46:1> How you sign up for survivors benefits depends on whether or not

you're getting other 'recial Security benefits.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#47:1> <h> If You Aren't Getting Social Security Benefits </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#48:1> You should apply for survivors benefits promptly because, in some

cases, benefits may not be retroactive.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#49:1> You can apply by telephone or at any Social Security office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#50:1> We need certain information to process your application.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#51:1> It 's helpful if you have it when you apply.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#52:1> But don't delay applying if you don't have everything.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#53:1> We will help you get it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#54:1> We need either original documents or copies certified by the agency

that issued them.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#55:1> <h> If You're Already Gett 're Social Security Benefits</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#56:1> If you're getting bene 'res as a wife or husband on your spouse 's

record when he or she dies, you should report the death to us and we will

change your payments to survivors benefits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#57:1> If we need more information, we'll contac 'llou.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#58:1> If you're getting be 'reits on your own record, you'll need t 'll
complete an application to get survivors benefits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#59:1> Call or visit us and we'll check 'llsee if you can get more money as

a widow or widower.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#60:1> We'll need t 'llee your spouse 's death certificate to process your

claim.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#61:1> Benefits for any children will automatically be changed to

survivors benefits after the death is reported to us.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#62:1> We'll conta 'llyou if we need more information.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#63:1> <h> How Much Will You Get? </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#64:1> The amount of your benefit is based on the earnings of the person

who died.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#65:1> The more he or she paid into Social Security, the higher your

benefits will be.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#66:1> The amount you will get is a percentage of the deceased 's basic

Social Security benefit.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#67:1> The percentage depends on your age and the type of benefit you are

eligible for. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#68:1> <h> Maximum Family Benefits </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#69:1> There is a limit to the amount of money that can be paid to you

and other family members each month.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#70:1> The limit varies, but is generally equal to about 150 to 180 percent

of the deceased 's benefit rate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#71:1> If the sum of the benefits payable to the family members is greater

than this limit, the benefits will be reduced proportionately.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#72:1> <h> Retirement Benefits For Widow(ers) </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#73:1> If you are receiving widows or widowers ( including divorced

widows or widowers) benefits, you should remember that you can switch to your

own retirement benefit as early as age 62.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#74:1> This assumes you're eli 'rele and your retirement rate is higher than

your widow'(er) rate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#75:1> In many cases, a widow(er) can begin receiving one benefit at a

reduced rate and then switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate at age

65.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#76:1> The rules are complicated and vary depending on your situation, so

you should talk to a one of our representatives about the options available

to you.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#77:1> <h> What If I Work? </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#78:1> If you get Social Security survivors benefits, the amount of your

benefits may be reduced if your earnings exceed certain limits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#79:1> To find out what the limits are this year and how earnings above

those limits reduce your social Security benefits, contact us to request the

leaflet, How Work Affects Your Benefits ( Publication No. 05-10069).
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#80:1> There 's no earnings limit once you reach age 70.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#81:1> Your earnings will reduce only your survivors benefits, not the

benefits of other family members.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#82:1> <h> What If I Remarry? </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#83:1> Generally, you can't get survivors benefits if you remarry.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#84:1> But, remarriage after age 60 ( 50 if disabled) will not prevent

benefit payments on your former spouse 's record.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#85:1> And, at age 62 or older, you may get benefits on the record of your

new spouse if they are higher.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#86:1> <h> A Word About Medicare </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#87:1> Medicare is a health insurance plan for people who are age 65 or

older.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#88:1> People who are disabled or have kidney failure also can get

Medicare.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#89:1> Medicare has two parts-hospital insurance and medical insurance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#90:1> Most people have both parts.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#91:1> Hospital insurance, sometimes called Part A, covers inpatient

hospital care and certain follow-up care.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#92:1> The worker already paid for it as part of his or her Social Security

taxes while he or she was working.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#93:1> Medical insurance, sometimes called Part B, pays for physicians'

services and some other services not covered by hospital insurance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#94:1> Medical insurance is optional, and you must pay a premium.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#95:1> Some people are already getting Social Security benefits when

they turn 65, and their Medicare starts automatically.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#96:1> Others must file an application.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#97:1> For more information, call the Health Care Financing Administration

at 1-800 MEDICAR(E) and ask for a copy of the handbook, " Medicare and You".
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#98:1> You also can visit the website at www.medicare.gov.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#99:1> <h> Help For Low-Income </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#100:1> Medicare Beneficiaries </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#101:1> If you get Medicare and have low income and few resources, your

state may pay your Medicare premiums and, in some cases, other "

out-of-pocket" Medicare expenses such as deductibles and coinsurance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#102:1> Only your state can decide if you qualify.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#103:1> To find out if you do, contact your local welfare office or Medicaid

agency.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#104:1> For more information about the program, contact Social Security and

ask for a copy of the publication Medicare Savings For Qualified

Beneficiaries ( HCFA Publication No. 02184).</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#105:1> <h> Your Personal Information Is Safe With Social Security </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#106:1> We keep personal information on millions of people.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#107:1> That information-such as your Social Security number, earnings

record, age, and address-is personal and confidential.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#108:1> Generally, we will discuss this information only with you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#109:1> We need your permission if you want someone else to help with your

Social Security business.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#110:1> If you ask friends or family members to call us, you need to be

with them when they call so we will know that you want them to help.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#111:1> Our representative will ask your permission to discuss your Social

Security business with that person.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#112:1> If you send a friend or family member to our local office to

conduct your Social Security business, send your written consent with them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#113:1> Only with your written permission can SSA discuss your personal

information with them and provide the answers to your questions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#114:1> In the case of a minor child, the natural parent or legal

guardian can act on the child 's behalf in taking care of the child 's Social

Security business.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-007#115:1> The privacy of your records is guaranteed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#116:1> There are times when the law requires Social Security to give

information to other government agencies to conduct other government health

or welfare programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Medicaid,

and food stamps.
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#117:1> Programs receiving information from Social Security are prohibited

from sharing that information.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-007#118:1> <h> For More Information </h>
