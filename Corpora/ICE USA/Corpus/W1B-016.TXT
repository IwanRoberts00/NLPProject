<ICE-USA:W1B-016#1:1> <h> 27 August 1996</H>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#2:1> <h> 199697 Executive Committee: <@> Jin Seo Park</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#3:1> Setting Agenda for Department Meeting on September 9</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#4:1> Aside from announcements, the main item must be deciding on

priorities for line requests for 9798, which are due at the Dean 's Office by

September 18.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#5:1> I would like the Executive Committee to have a recommendation to put

before the department; the relevant guidelines and constraints are as

follows:

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#6:1> 1) Every position request, even for a line vacated by death or

retirement, must be fully justified, even though the Academic Program Review

determined that our department should be maintained at its current strength.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#7:1> 2) Programmatic integrity will be only one of several criteria

used in determining which units will be permitted to recruit.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#8:1> 3) Enrollments will be a factor in awarding lines.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#9:1> This means both actual numbers and potential numbers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#10:1> Any proposed line likely to increase enrollments will be viewed

favorably.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#11:1> 4) Affirmative action is a high priority this year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#12:1> Lines will go to those depts. that can demonstrate that there is a

pool of candidates of color for the position being recruited.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#13:1> 5) Positions that will strengthen general education also remain

desirable.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#14:1> 6) The possibility of joint appointments should be explored; a

department increases the possibility of getting more than one line if one of

the requests is for a person who would contribute a percentage of teaching

and service to one of the collegiate programs or intercollegiate divisions.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#15:1> All this being so, we should consider, in addition to the obvious

need for an American literature specialist to replace <@> Gia Lannone</@>,

how to weigh our FY 96 requests for an AfricanAmericanist and a professional

writing position and the FY 95 request for a specialist in pedagogy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#16:1> We might also give some thought to how we could design a line that we

share with, for instance, the new Communications Division.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#17:1> Possibilities: a specialist in media studies, media production,

and/or telecommunications; a professional writer/journalist; a visiting

professional writer/creative writer</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#18:1> What else should be on the table?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#19:1> 25 November 1996</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#20:1> To PartTime English Faculty</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#21:1> From <@> Bill Cross</@>, Chair</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#22:1> Back in September I promised to schedule a second meeting of

parttime faculty before the term was over, preferably in November.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#23:1> At the time I hadn't fully grasped what kind of pace I would have to

march at during the fall semesterand so I am already very late.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#24:1> I expect that many of you are also tired at this point in the

semester and are trying to hold on until the last day of classes.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#25:1> So, I wonder if I can make this proposal:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#26:1> notice has already gone out about an informal holiday party on

the afternoon of Friday, December 13, following a department meeting at noon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#27:1> What if we had a gathering of as many of you as wanted to meet over

coffee and doughnuts at 10 A.M. on the 13th?
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#28:1> Then you could stay on if you like for the department meeting and/or

the party.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#29:1> As always, this proposed meeting is purely voluntary; you are

under no obligation to come, and you are most welcome to skip the meeting and

still come to the party in the afternoon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#30:1> I'd apprec 'dte it if you would leave a note in my mailbox if you

want to have this meetingand you might add what topics you would want to

see on the agenda.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#31:1> If at least eight of you want to meet I'll book a 'llace, send out a

confirmation note, and we'll go ahe 'lland gather at 10 o'clock on the

13th.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#32:1> <h> 3 December 1996</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#33:1> To PartTime English Faculty</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#34:1> It appears that there is enough interest to warrant scheduling an

endofterm meeting on Friday, December 13, from 10:0011:45 AM.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#35:1> I have reserved the Music Department Lounge, room W694.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#36:1> There will be coffee and doughnuts. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#37:1> I have one suggested agenda item: Creative writing opportunities

for ESL students who have completed the 101E102E sequence; <@> Bruce

Joyce</@> will speak to this issue. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#38:1> Please let me know of any other topics for discussion that you

want on the table.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#39:1> I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible on the 13th. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#40:1> Reminder: holiday party starting shortly after 2 o'clock that

afternoon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#41:1> The main task of the committee for this year is to undertake a

comprehensive review of the department 's curriculum for majors, leading to a

set of recommendations for a revision of the curriculum and the requirements

for the B.A. in English. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#42:1> The work of the committee may be enhanced and supported if the

department receives a grant from the ACEKellogg funds available for

assessment work on the campus [ see attached proposal], but with or without

the grant the following tasks need to be accomplished:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#43:1> 1) Research into how other departments have redesigned their

English majors in recent years.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#44:1> This research should probably pay particular attention to any of our

peer institutions whose English departments have revised their majors [ e.g.,

George Mason, University of IllinoisChicago, University of

MarylandBaltimore, etc.], but need not be limited to our peer institutions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#45:1> [ For starters, see packet on the new English curriculum at Millsaps

College.]
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#46:1> The committee should aim to gather the materials for this research by

the end of the fall semester.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#47:1> 2) Study of the planning for the new university general education

program to ensure that planning and sequencing of major requirements is

synchronized with general education developments on the campus.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#48:1> Curriculum committee members should read the April 1996 report of the

General Education Steering Committee and the new report of that committee

which is scheduled to be submitted for review by the Faculty Council in

November 1996.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#49:1> 3) Assessment of strengths and limitations of the current English

major program, including sophomore requirements and advanced requirements and

electives; scheduling patterns of courses; kinds of courses or requirements

missing from the curriculum; means for ensuring quality control of the major

program and for measuring student accomplishment in the program.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#50:1> The committee should aim to make a preliminary report of its findings

to the department at the March 1997 department meeting; the committee may

also want to propose at this meeting a mechanism for ongoing consultation

with and involvement by the department in the process of reshaping the

curriculum.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#51:1> 4) After discussion with the department, the Curriculum Committee

should concentrate on developing its recommendations for changes to the

English major curriculum.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#52:1> A final report and recommendations on the major should be presented

to the department for its consideration by the end of the Fall 1997

semester.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#53:1> <h> 16 December 1996</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#54:1> <h> To: Dean <@> Will Ruff</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#55:1> As I promised a few days ago, I brought to the department meeting

of December 13 your offer of a onethird share of the line that has been

awarded to the Africana Studies Department for a position in AfricanAmerican

literature.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#56:1> The department has instructed me to accept this offer, although with

a deep sense of dismay and disappointment that the teaching needs of the

department and our obligations to our students, as detailed in our requests

for our own tenuretrack appointments, are not being addressed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#57:1> In accepting the share of the line with Africana Studies I'd like 'd
to specify several understandings for the future:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#58:1> 1) You and I both agree that this offer does not satisfy the

department 's need for faculty in American literature, AfricanAmerican

literature, and other minority literatures, and that the acceptance of this

offer by our department should not be understood as undercutting or

prejudicing the department 's resubmission of requests for those positions

next year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#59:1> 2) Although you have expressed the hope that the candidate

eventually hired by Africana Studies might have pedagogical expertise that

could be helpful in the preparation or supervision of English education

majors, you and I both agree that this onethird position can not satisfy the

department 's urgent need for additional fulltime support for its majors

preparing to teach in the schools.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#60:1> 3) The English department shall be represented by two members on

the search committee for the candidate; shall conduct annual reviews of the

teaching done by the appointee in English department courses and have a voice

in decisions about reappointment; and shall have a substantive role in

fourthyear and tenure reviews of the appointee.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#61:1> 4) Because the department remains understaffed in American

literature after the deaths of <@> Jay Trib</@> and <@> Ed Man</@>, we will

be seeking temporary lines, fulltime or parttime, in 199798 to ensure the

adequacy of our offerings in the American literature program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#62:1> Finally, I must convey my own sense of frustration, shared by

many others in the department, on two scores.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#63:1> The inability of the College to offer us even the minimal number of

lines called for by the Academic Program Review raises real questions whether

program reviews offer meaningful or reliable assurances to departments about

their capacity to carry out their missions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#64:1> Once again, there will be increased cynicism within the faculty

community that program reviews serve only managerial interests rather than

the interests of academic programs or students.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#65:1> And even more importantly, I feel frustrated at the department 's

being prevented from recruiting more minority faculty.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#66:1> The provost 's committee on minority faculty has dispatched frequent

messages about the university 's commitment to minority recruitment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#67:1> My department was fully prepared to heed that call and was confident

that we could identify excellent minority candidates for several of the lines

we requested.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#68:1> It is discouraging that we have not been permitted to make this

effort.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#69:1> <h> 25 November 1996</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#70:1> <h> To All Faculty and Staff</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#71:1> <h> A Few Announcements</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#72:1> 1. The Executive Committee and I have discussed using a portion [

the amount as yet undetermined] of the department 's allocation from the

university 's annual fund to proceed with the renovation of the Department

Lounge and the construction of the Gittleman Library.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#73:1> In order to ensure that anyone in the department with an interest in

the future uses and appearance of the lounge has a chance to help make the

decisions about this common space, the Executive Committee has authorized a

redecorating committee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#74:1> Membership is open to any member of the departmental faculty or staff

who wishes to join.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#75:1> <@> Jan Akeve</@> will chair the committee; please let Janet know if

you would like to join.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#76:1> Since we expect some of the renovation work to be initiated sometime

in the spring semester, some important decisions about planning should be

made soon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#77:1> Several memos on the Urban Mission Action Plan, dated October

1996, from colleagues are in general circulation and other materials have

been sent to members of the ad hoc committee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#78:1> These memos will help frame the discussion, but all members of the

department may want to read the Urban Mission Action Plan before the December

13 meeting.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#79:1> 3. Following the department meeting, we will have an informal

holiday celebration.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#80:1> I would ask for volunteers to supply simple potluck appetizers and

snacks; the department budget will take care of beverages for the occasion.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#81:1> If you are able to contribute something to the buffet of appetizers,

please tear off the bottom of this sheet and leave it in my mailbox.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#82:1> <h> December 13</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#83:1> Film requests for the Spring semester should be submitted in the

second week of December ( Dec. 913) to <@> Sven Luda</@> in the Film

Services office in Healey Library.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#84:1> Because of reduced funds this year it is important to make timely

submissions of requests.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#85:1> Film request forms will be available in the department office.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#86:1> We also have an uptodate catalog of films and videos owned by the

university.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#87:1> For additional information, contact <@> Kay Chow</@> directly at

extension 75961. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#88:1> <h> 9 December 1996</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#89:1> 1. Department Meeting, Friday, December 13 at noon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#90:1> To be followed, at approximately 2 o'clock, by a holiday celebration

with drinks and appetizers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#91:1> We have a few commitments for appetizers; if you are thinking you

might be hungry on Friday, please volunteer to bring some food.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#92:1> 2. Change in eligibility for the Peter Brooks Butler Scholarship

to Oxford.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#93:1> Requirements used to state that this scholarship for tuition and air

fare for the summer program at Oxford was not open to seniors.
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#94:1> Please let students in your courses know that applications are open

to any English major with an interest in Renaissance literature or creative

writing who will not yet have graduated by the end of August 1997.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#95:1> <h> 14 November 1996</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-016#96:1> <h> To English Department</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-016#97:1> I want to report on how our financial picture looks at the

moment, and I invite you to give me or a member of the Executive

Committeeyour suggestions about departmental priorities for spending of our

discretionary funds in II and III below. </p>
