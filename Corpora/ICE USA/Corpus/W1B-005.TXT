<ICE-USA:W1B-005#1:1> <h> Dear <@> Anna</@>,</h>

<p> Well, here I go again, starting a third letter-- thank you, by the way,

for not being home when I called - - I really can't afford the phone bills,

but I was so psyched for the excuse to come to Boston, I wanted to tell you

right away!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#2:1> Jake, one of my best friends, is Musical Director for The Wall at Penn

the first two weekends in April, so I have to go see that at one point, and

there may or may not be some job-related stuff for me to do, but I will

definitely come to see Hamlet & Mia & you ( not necessarily in that order!).
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#3:1> Let me know what weekends you have to work, etc.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#4:1> since I know nothing about getting around Boston & will need you as my

guide. </p>

<p> I'm sitting here on a bench in the National Gallery, parked in fr 'mt of

Monet 's Garden in Someplace, watching the culture-vultures come and go.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#5:1> I have 2:30 Titian tickets ( yay!) so I'm killing time until then.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#6:1> It 's really 'meat how different paintings grab different people.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#7:1> Well, since this will probably get mailed before the 8 page letter,

I'll backtrack a bit; just so you know, 'llvin and I broke up-- amicably, for

the most part.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#8:1> Full details are coming in the mammoth letter ( chock full o'details,

I promise), so that 's 'dll I'll say for now.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#9 'll I'm still sad, but not depressed; progress. </p>

<p> Hey 'mhow open are you about your bi/lesbianism?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#10:1> I appreciate your open-ness with me ( it 's good to hear you sounding

so happy!), but who all knows?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#11:1> Family?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#12:1> Friends?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#13:1> Who do you want to know?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#14:1> Or not?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#15:1> I hate to be asking such technical questions when I have others, but,

for now, these are a start.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#16:1> Anyhow, stay happy, stay sane, and save me an April weekend.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#17:1> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#18:1> <h> <@> Olivia</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#19:1> <h> Dear <@> Anna</@></h>

<p> I love Melinda cards...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#20:1> I identify.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#21:1> Besides, they're recycled.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#22:1> ( What a 'reppie statement!)</p>

<p> I'm so sorry things didn't work out for Hamlet.
<ICE-USA 'm1B-005#23:1> Sometime this summer I swear I'll get to Boston...really.
<ICE-U 'llW1B-005#24:1> I'll catch the Trump shuttle or some 'llng ( ha!) ( there 's the true

yuppie statement for you).
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#25:1> Things are going well here in my daily dedicated-to-education life; I

still like it here ( though I may not after my performance review this

afternoon-- aack!), despite the politics and the depressing turnover rate (

seven people in the four months I've been here!).
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#26:1> Oh wel 've
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#27:1> I'll deal.</p>

<p> Otherwise, li 'llis still nice-- I spent this weekend in DC, amazingly

enough - - Miriam came down for our last " single girls' weekend" before her

wedding next month ( yes, O. the Eternal Bridesmaid strikes again!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#28:1> This time, it 's pink moir, with dyed-to-match shoes-- aaack!).
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#29:1> We had a good time-- we saw the sights of [ - - - ] , largely because

I locked us out of my apartment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#30:1> ( My brilliance never fails to astound.)</p>

<p> I got a letter from Dianne yesterday; I have to laugh every time I do;

she 's so funny, even when nothing in her life is.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#31:1> She 's a joy to hear from; I'm glad we're back in touch.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#3 'm're Jasna GOT INTO UVA!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#33:1> She 's in their PhD program for English.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#34:1> I can't wait to call her " Doctor Kingston." I also can't wait to

have her only 2 hours south!</p>

<p> Well, I'm glad everyone else is having exciting lives 'mor me to write

about!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#35:1> Me, I just have work & class...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#36:1> Oh well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#37:1> Soon I'll make it more exciting via 'llps to London-- and, I hope,

Boston!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#38:1> Meanwhile, I hope you have the happiest possible birthday!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#39:1> Take care & stay in touch - - </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#40:1> <h> love, <@> Olivia</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#41:1> <h> Dear <@> Anna</@></h> ,

<p> How 's life in Boston?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#42:1> I hope all is going well with you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#43:1> I'm still pretty pissed that a Hamlet visit d 'mn't work out-- did you

go see it?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#44:1> Was it incredible or merely fantastic?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#45:1> Give me details!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#46:1> ( I'm not exactly on Mia 's correspondence list 'm</p>

<p> Lots of stuff going on here in our nation 's capital-- first, as you may

have noticed on the envelope, we're moving.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#47:1 'reason, Brenda & I are joining with Mike & Sonia, two MIT types, and

moving to the [ - - - ] area, one Metro stop away from where we are now.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#48:1> Just in case you get as excited as I do to actually have mail and you

tear envelopes to shreds, the new address is [ - - - - - - ] .</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-005#49:1> [ - - - ] is following us there.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#50:1> ( Hooray!)
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#51:1> We're having a housewarming party - 're big one-- on either 9/21 or

10/5 - I'll keep you posted!
<ICE- 'll:W1B-005#52:1> I'd love for you to come, 'den or another weekend--although that gets

a bit complicated due to my second piece of big news...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#53:1> I got promoted last month!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#54:1> This ( for the most part) is a good thing, although it has meant tons

more work and a ridiculous amount of stress.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#55:1> But the new position includes travel ( you know those high school

visits we always used to get out of math or Rodes 's French class?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#56:1> That 's me), and I'm hoping for some New England so I 'mn hop up to

see you for a weekend ( or all, of course!).
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#57:1> Again, I'll keep you posted.
<I 'llUSA:W1B-005#58:1> Jasna is coming down to DC today-- UVA isn't giving her any money, so

she 's job hunting down here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#59:1> Elton 's parents live in Silver Spring, so that 's pretty convenient.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#60:1> We have a ( tiny) 6th bedroom in our new house that 's going unused,

so I'm kind of keeping my fingers c 'mssed...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#61:1> at the very least, she'll probably stay wi 'llus for a week or so, and

she is looking for employment at AU, so even if we don't live together, we

could do lunch or something.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#62:1> It 's funny, since we were little kids we'd dreamed of livi 'd together

in some big city after graduation... now it might actually happen. </p>

<p> Are you going to track Steph down when she moves to Harvard?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#63:1> I got a super letter from her a month or so ago; I also had about a

2-hour conversation with Liah - she 's going to med school next year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#64:1> What a neat family.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#65:1> Speaking of, how 's your brother?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#66:1> Your parents?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#67:1> Inquiring minds want to know...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#68:1> Take care.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#69:1> I miss you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#70:1> <h> <@> Olivia</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#71:1> <h> Dear <@> Anna</@></h>

<p> Hi!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#72:1> Yes, we really were at the Taj, I certainly didn't pay for this

stationery!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#73:1> ( At least not overtly.) And regarding loving letters, yours are

always magnificent, and not only for your handwriting, which gets more

interesting every time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#74:1> It 's also nice to have someone ( somewhat) in my life who thinks

about Deeper Issues of Life; if any of my housemates do, they definitely keep

it to themselves.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#75:1> Jason, who found us our hyper-cool yuppie M-St Apt., is a generally

interesting guy, largely because he keeps to himself a lot, so any personal

revelations are instantly fascinating.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#76:1> He 's nice & social, but pretty intensely private.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#77:1> I made some headway with him during our last days at [ - - - ] ,

largely because Brenda wasn't there... it gave me a chance to learn more

about what makes him tick. </p>

<p> He 's southern & Jewish...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#78:1> if you've seen Driving M 've Daisy ( I haven't), that 's basically his

family.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#79:1> ( It is his temple & rabbi in the movie.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#80:1> Neat.) </p>

<p> Mike & Sonia I don't know that well yet, but I suppose I will since my

room is in between theirs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#81:1> Mike works with Brenda, and he & Sonia went to MIT together; that 's

the extent of my knowledge.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#82:1> But they might know Bostonians coming down for the party...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#83:1> I'll be in t 'llh.</p>

<p> Jasna & Elton are doing fine.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#84:1> They're actually v 're good for each other, I think; it 's one of the

most supportive relationships I've seen, and 'veey obviously adore each other.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#85:1> They are both frantically job hunting, and if a relationship can

survive double unemployment, that speaks volumes to me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#86:1> Hey, kudos on your new job!
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#87:1> Sounds great.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#88:1> I can easily see you being Gabelesque.</p>

<p> Washington DC is a super place to live.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#89:1> [ - - - ] was a very funky neighborhood, and I miss it already.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#90:1> ( I'm not much more 'mhan a mile away, but my new place is basically

suburbs - - big trees, quiet backyard, and the zoo & [ - - - ] across the

street ( albeit a busy street).
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#91:1> Prices of everything are outrageous, though, and even food is taxed

at 6 % aroun&percent; here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#92:1> But if you stay out of the Southeast section, DC wins huge points for

livability.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#93:1> Metro makes my day every morning ( though the escalators are from

hell).
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#94:1> There are cool restaurants, bars & clubs near me, and lots of my

friends moved here, who are introducing me to their friends... and so it

goes.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#95:1> In the latest interesting development, Allan has moved down here...we

just spent the last two evenings together which were pleasant-- much to my

surprise, actually, since pleasant is not a word I would have chosen to

describe many of our times together in the 31/2 years ( ! ) since we broke

up.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#96:1> But frankly, he 's provided me with a nice escape from the new-house

hassles we've been hav 've.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#97:1> I know we won't start going out again, but I will be interested to

see what does develop.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#98:1> He 's off to visit his sister in Minnesota and then starts work on

Tuesday...we'll see 'llt happens.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#99:1> And that 's it for now - - more stories ( mostly of travels) later,

I'm sure - - 'make care!</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#100:1> <h> <@> Olivia</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#101:1> <h> Dear <@> Anna</@></h>

<p> I'm so sorry 'm haven't gotten a chance to call you back; life has been

just crazy lately, and

&dollar; is tight, so I'm resortin 'mto the old standby, US Mail.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#102:1> Sorry; hope there was nothing time urgent.</p>

<p> Things are actually going pretty well for me here; I started two summer

courses, Educational Psychology and Statistics - - bleah.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#103:1> Well, EdPsych is great - I'm really e 'moying the readings, and the

professor is very interesting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#104:1> Stat is basically a nightmare, but it 's as good as it 's ever going

to get - - take home exams, top 5 of 6 count, 5 bonus points for a good joke,

I keep thinking to myself, " It 's almost over...it 's almost over..."
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#105:1> End of June, I'm free 'm
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#106:1> Yay!</p>

<p> This is my summer of a zillion weddings.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#107:1> I had one this weekend in New Jersey, one next month in Atlanta - -

and, in a few weeks, I'm goin 'mto <@> Kelvin Hoene 's</@> wedding.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#108:1> Don't ask how that came about.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#109:1> But at any rate, I'm pre 'my excited.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#110:1> Only trouble is, weddings are mighty expensive for the guests as

well as the givers, so ( to return to the theme) hence the letter.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#111:1> Other than that, not too much is going on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#112:1> Will you be home for July 4?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#113:1> I'm not 'mure yet what I'm doi 'm.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#114:1> I feel kind of dumb leaving DC on July 4; the fireworks are

spectacular - - but if enough people ( any people, almost) are going to be

home, I might be swayed.</p>

<p> Take care, <@> Anne</@>, and thanks for staying in touch.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#115:1> I do appreciate your efforts, and hopefully when I'm not 'mwamped in

July, I promise we'l 'llit down & talk.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#116:1> <h> <@> Olivia</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#117:1> <h> Hi <@> Anna</@></h>

<p> Saw this & somehow thought of you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#118:1> It 's my turn to be sending postcards from SF ( I LOVED yours, by the

way) - I'm o 'm here for work.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#119:1> I'v 'veust completed week 3 of 9 on the road-- 1st DC, then NJ, now

SF, LA, SF, DC, VA, UT & LA.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#120:1> I love my job.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#121:1> I love the people I work with, the things I do...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#122:1> I'm 'memendously happy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#123:1> Right now, I'm 'maying w/Stan - - yesterday we went to the

Exploratorium & the Haight, so it hasn't been all work & no fun.</p>

<p> Tonight I fly to LA.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#124:1> Well, LA will be fine, but I' 'llmiss everyone & thing here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#125:1> Penn may have goofed - - I may not come back! </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#126:1> <h> <@> Olivia</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#127:1> <h> Dear <@> Anna</@></h>

<p> How 's Boston?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#128:1> New England feels like the only place I haven't been...
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#129:1> actually, it is, now that I look at it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#130:1> I 've seen NJ, DC, VA, CA and now UT.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#131:1> This job is a blast, though I am exhausted & on the verge of a cold

from the climate changes.
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#132:1> Will you be home for T-giving?
<ICE-USA:W1B-005#133:1> Let me know!

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-005#134:1> <h> <@> Olivia</@></h> </I>
