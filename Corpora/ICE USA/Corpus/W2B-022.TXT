<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#1:1> Oddly enough, though Charles Darwin stood the scientific world on

end by what he found by going to sea 135 years ago, subsequent tinkerers in

evolutionary theory have been largely landlubbers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#2:1> Virtually ignoring seven-tenths of our planet 's surface, such

investigators focused on land-locked fossil records, establishing evolution 's

hallowed grounds in the plains of East Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#3:1> Surely a lack of sophistication in sea-faring technology accounts

for much of the land-based research effort, although effective deep-sea

trawling and sampling devices were in use by scientists in Darwin 's day.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#4:1> But even with the advent of powerful sonar gear and deep-ocean

drilling techniques in the 1950s, evolutionists' attention remained largely

riveted on dusty fragments gleaned from the world 's remote hillsides.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#5:1> In recent years, however, scientists began revisiting the oceans,

curious about how certain sea fossils fit models of evolutionary theory

synthesized almost entirely from scattered, often puzzling evidence recovered

from dry land.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#6:1> Some intriguing results turned up recently in the laboratories of two

Florida State University ( FSU) marine paleontologists.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#7:1> Tony Arnold and Bill Parker compiled what may be the largest, most

complete set of data on the evolutionary history of any group of organisms,

marine or otherwise.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#8:1> The two scientists amassed something that their land-based colleagues

only dreamed about: An intact fossil record with no missing links.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#9:1> " It 's all here-a virtually complete evolutionary record," says

Arnold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#10:1> " There are other good examples, but this is by far the best.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#11:1> We're seeing the who 'repicture of how this group of organisms has

changed throughout most of its existence on Earth."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#12:1> The organism that Arnold and Parker study is a single- celled,

microscopic animal belonging to the Foraminiferida, an order of hard-shelled,

planktonic marine protozoans.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#13:1> Often shortened to " forams," the name comes from the Latin word

<foreign> foramen </foreign> , or " opening."
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#14:1> The organisms can be likened to amoebas wearing shells, with

perforations through which their protoplasm extends.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#15:1> The foram shell shapes range from plain to bizarre.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#16:1> Tropical and subtropical seas around the globe abound with

forams, which are divided into two general types: The free- floating,

planktonic form that is uniformly small ( usually less than a 5Oth of an inch

long) and the benthic or bottom-dwelling variety that is typically much

larger.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#17:1> The latter type is perhaps best remembered by Earth-science students

or by spelunkers who commonly find the fossils imbedded in cave walls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#18:1> The ancient Egyptians used limestone blocks containing the large,

extinct <it> Nummulites </it> to build the tops of some Giza pyramids.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#19:1> But it 's the planktonic variety that chiefly interests Parker and

Arnold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#20:1> Unlike their oversized cousins, free-swimming forams are found almost

everywhere in the oceans.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#21:1> Their fossilized skeletons, in fact, were among some of the first

biological material recovered from deep ocean bottoms by scientists in the

1850s.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#22:1> For nearly a century, geologists have used the tiny fossils to help

establish the age of sediments and to gain insight into prehistoric

climates.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#23:1> Only since the early 1960s, though, have scientists begun to

fully appreciate fossil forams' potential as a tool for use in evolutionary

studies and a host of Earth sciences as well.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#24:1> Advanced deep-sea drilling techniques, combined with computer-

assisted analytical tools, have ushered in a whole new vista of foram

research.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#25:1> Arnold and Parker are among the first scientists to harness

sophisticated technology to a foram project for the express purpose of

studying evolution.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#26:1> In 1980, Arnold successfully married computers with optical

devices to create an efficient, precise way to analyze foram fossils.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#27:1> Before the technique was developed, the field was represented only by

a few extraordinarily dedicated individuals who spent countless hours over

microscopes, sorting and analyzing the sand-grain-sized shells virtually by

hand.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#28:1> The apparatus Arnold and Parker now use combines the latest in

video technology with their specially programmed computer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#29:1> Although it requires an operator, the system is the fastest, most

reliable means of foram identification and classification available.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#30:1> It soon will become far more powerful if its developers succeed in

linking it with a scanning electron microscope.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#31:1> " There 's a nifty passage in Darwin." says Arnold, " in which he

describes the fossil record as a library with only a few books, and each book

has only a few chapters.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#32:1> The chapters have only a few words, and the words are missing

letters."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#33:1> " Well, in this case, we've got a relativ 've complete library,"

says Arnold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#34:1> " The ` books' are in excellent shape.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#35:1> You can see every page, every word."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#36:1> As he speaks, Arnold shows a series of microphotographs,

depicting the evolutionary change wrought on a single foram species.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#37:1> " This is the same organism, as it existed through 500,OOO years," he

says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#38:1> " We've got hundreds 'veexamples like this, complete life and

evolutionary histories for dozens of species."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#39:1> About 330 species of living and extinct planktonic forams have

been classified so far.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#40:1> After thorough examinations of marine sediments collected from around

the world, micropaleontologists now suspect these are just about all the

free- floating forams that ever existed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#41:1> The species collection also is exceptionally well-preserved,

which accounts largely for the excitement shared by Parker and Arnold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#42:1> " Most fossils, particularly those of the vertebrates, are

fragmented-just odd and ends," says Parker.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#43:1> " But these fossils are almost perfectly preserved, despite being

millions of years old." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#44:1> By being so small, the fossil shells escaped nature 's grinding

and crushing forces, which over the eons have in fact destroyed most evidence

of life on Earth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#45:1> The extraordinary condition of the shells permits the paleontologists

to study in detail not only how a whole species develops, but how individual

animals develop from birth to adulthood.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#46:1> The resulting data base thus holds unprecedented power for

evolutionary studies, says Arnold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#47:1> Not only can he and Parker use it to describe how evolution has

worked in a particular species, but they can use it as a standard for testing

evolutionary theories, which are growing in number.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#48:1> " Scientists are overflowing with ideas on the laws of evolution,

or principles of evolutionary change, but most of them are simply untestable

because of the poor fossil record," says Arnold, " And unless they can be

scientifically tested, theories don't really amount to much.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#49:1> So, what we have here is a wonderful opportunity to test a lot of

these ideas quantita- tively.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#50:1> We'll be able to 'lly, with some degree of reliability, that <it> yes

</it> , this or that happens in the forams or <it> no </it> , it doesn't."

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#51:1> Some biologists have long suspected that the evolutionary process

works differently, although within certain principles, among different

species.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#52:1> In other words, what may be true for evolution in mammals may not be

true in mollusks.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#53:1> The forams may not be representative of all organisms but, at

least in this group, we can actually see how evolution happened," says

Parker.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#54:1> " We can see transitions from one species to another.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#55:1> And that 's a <it> very </it> rare observation."

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#56:1> Had Darwin been able to examine the fossil record of forams, he

could have fortified many of his arguments on how new species come into

being, and perhaps eased a nagging worry about the terribly incomplete fossil

record yielded by terrestrial research.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#57:1> As for the origin of species, the famous naturalist always held

that new plants and animals arise from unstable varieties sprung off from old

species.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#58:1> Competition among varieties and their abilities to withstand

environmental pressures eventually lead to populations that are so profoundly

different that they become reproductively incompatible with populations other

than themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#59:1> And <foreign> voila </foreign> , a new species is born.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#60:1> Darwin termed the process <it> gradualism </it> , a theory that

invokes the slow accumulation of small evolutionary changes over a large

period of time, as a result of the pressures of natural selection.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#61:1> What Arnold and Parker found is almost a textbook example of

gradualism at work.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#62:1> We've literally 'ven hundreds of speciation events," says Arnold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#63:1> This allows us to check for patterns, to determine what exactly is

going on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#64:1> We can quickly tell whether something is a recurring phenomenon-a

pattern-or whether it 's just an anomaly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#65:1> This way, we cannot only look for the same things that have been

observed in living organisms, but we can see just how often these things

really happen in the environment over an enormous period of time." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#66:1> Such a revelation flies in the face of latter-day rethinking of

Darwinian evolution, which during the past 20 years has tended to gravitate

toward a new theory called <it> punctuated equilibrium </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#67:1> First postulated in the early 1970s by paleontologists Niles Eldredge

and Stephen J. Gould, this idea refutes gradualism 's central premise that

great amounts of time are necessary to create new species.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#68:1> Punctuated equilibrium holds that new species may arise fairly

quickly ( over thousands instead of millions of years) from small animal

populations that somehow become isolated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#69:1> Intermediate stages are too fleeting to become fixed in the fossil

record-thus the conspicuous gaps or so-called missing links.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#70:1> ( Darwin blamed the " imperfection in the geological record" for the

gaps in the fossil record.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#71:1> But in the near-perfect record exhibited by the forams studied at

FSU, the highly touted Eldredge-Gould theory of punctuated equilibrium

apparently doesn't work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#72:1> The record reveals a robust, highly branched evolutionary tree,

complete with Darwin 's predicted " dead ends"-varieties that lead nowhere-

and-a profusion of variability in sizes and body shapes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#73:1> Transitional forms between species are readily apparent, making it

relatively easy to track ancestor species to their descendants.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#74:1> In short, the finding upholds Darwin 's lifelong conviction that "

nature does not proceed in leaps," but rather is a system perpetually

unfolding in extreme slow motion.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#75:1> In the hands of less scrupulous observers, the foram record may

have been construed to <it> support </it> Gould 's hypothesis about the

suddenness of speciation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#76:1> Darwin would have been shocked to find out just how fast the great

family of forams churns out new species, says Parker.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#77:1> Through dating analysis, he and his colleague showed that the forams

could produce a whole new species in as little as 200,000 years-speedy by

Darwinian standards.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#78:1> " But as fast as this is, it 's still far too slow to be classed as

punctuational," says Arnold.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#79:1> Other curiosities are beginning to emerge from the probe into the

forams' past.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#80:1> One finding is being described-perhaps too hastily-as disproving

Cope 's Rule, named for its synthesis by American paleontologist Edward

Drinker Cope.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#81:1> His time-honored evolutionary principle basically holds that, within

a group, animals tend to start out small and increase in size over time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#82:1> " We've fou 'veout that apparently, lineages don't exactly work

that way," says Arnold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#83:1> " Many of the forams start out small, and essentially stay that way

until extinction.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#84:1> Others do manage to wander into dramatically larger sizes, but

they're th 'reare ones." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#85:1> This find doesn't necessarily contradict what Cope said, only

what many scientists <it> think </it> he said, says Parker.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#86:1> " Cope 's observation was simply that there are a few extremely large

examples ( of individuals) in any given lineage, and these examples always

occur at the later stages of the organism 's development.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#87:1> And that 's apparently true.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#88:1> But our findings show that the vast majority of forams start small

and end small, even though the mean size increases somewhat due to a few very

large specimens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#89:1> As you get more and more species evolving, some of them eventually

manage to get moderately to very large, but most of them don't increase in

size at all."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#90:1> It may be in what the foram record suggests about how life copes

with mass annihilation that eventually draws the most attention to the FSU

paleontologists' work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#91:1> The geologic record has been prominently scarred by a series of

global cataclysms of unknown, yet hotly debated, origin.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#92:1> Each event, whether rapid or slow, wreaked wholesale carnage on

Earth 's ecology, wiping out countless species that had taken nature millions

of years to produce.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#93:1> Biologists have always wondered how life bounces back after such

sweeping devastation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#94:1> One of the last great extinctions occurred roughly 66 million

years ago and, according to one popular theory, it resulted from Earth 's

receiving a direct hit from a large asteroid.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#95:1> Whatever the cause, the event proved to be the dinosaurs' <foreign>

coup de grace </foreign> , and also wiped out a good portion of the marine

life-including almost all species of planktonic forams.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#96:1> This period of massive death, which ended the Cretaceous Period,

ushered in the modern chapter of biological development.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#97:1> Earth entered the new era, the Cenozoic, with a wide range of

ecosystems virtually devoid of life ( and thus competition between species),

yet quite fertile and primed for repopulation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#98:1> Some observers, perhaps following Darwin 's lead, have envisioned

a sedate repopulation sequence, with speciation occurring at an immensely

slow rate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#99:1> None of the species die off until their numbers begin to saturate the

environment, exhausting its capacity to sustain such proliferation of

life.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-022#100:1> Other scientists have theorized, but never been able to

demonstrate, that in the absence of competition, an explosion of life takes

place.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#101:1> The evolution of new species greatly accelerates, and a profusion of

body shapes and sizes bursts across the horizon, filling up vacant spaces

like weeds overtaking a pristine lawn.
<ICE-USA:W2B-022#102:1> An array of new forms fans out into these limited niches where

crowding soon forces most of the new forms to spin out into oblivion similar

to sparks from a bonfire.</p> </I>
