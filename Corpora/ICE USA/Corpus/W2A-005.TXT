<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#5:1> The notion of the sacred or the numinous as a category for

understanding religion was substantially launched by Rudolf Otto ( 1869-1937)

in his classic Idea of the Holy ( Das Heilige) in 1917. Otto, indeed, coined

the term " numinous," which has now become part of common usage. Otto 's

influence on thought about religion extends from C.G. Jung ( 1875-1961) to

the " Chicago School" of history of religion founded by Mircea Eliade (

1907-1986). On the other hand, Otto 's influence on the philosophy of religion

has been less strong, perhaps because he was professionally more of a

theologian ( not rigorous enough for philosophers) and is too easily

misunderstood and dismissed as describing some kind of mysticism. Even in the

history of religion, Otto 's own analysis often does not persuade because of

his clear preferences for Christianity and his devaluation of religions that

do not measure up to Christian paradigms. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#6:1> The history of Rudolf Otto 's theory of the sacred begins, however,

more than a century earlier, with the great philosopher Immanuel Kant (

1724-1804).
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#7:1> Otto 's own confidence in his ability to talk about God has its origin

in Kant 's own theory about the basis of the concept of God in human reason.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#8:1> In the Critique of Pure Reason ( 1781) Kant had reworked the

traditional distinction between the immanent ( within the world) and the

transcendent ( outside the world) by distinguishing between phenomena and

things-in-themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#9:1> " Phenomena" are how it is that objects appear in our own conscious

minds.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#10:1> We do not have access to the world outside of the experiences we

enjoy through our own consciousness, and Kant believed that consciousness

itself, or the possibility of conscious experience, imposes certain

conditions on the manner in which phenomenal objects appear to us.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#11:1> Among those conditions are the forms of space and time and the

abstract forms of connections between events and objects such as the concept

of substance and the relation between cause and effect.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#12:1> David Hume ( 1711-1776) had challenged philosophers to show why it is

that we believe in principles such as the one that every event must have a

cause.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#13:1> Kant 's answer, then, was that the mind itself constructs a phenomenal

reality according to just such a rule. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#14:1> Things-in-themselves, in turn, are the way that reality exists

apart from our experience, our consciousness, our minds, and all the

conditions that our minds might impose on phenomenal objects.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#15:1> The question occurs, then, whether concepts like substance and cause

and effect apply to things-in-themselves the same way that they do to

phenomena.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#16:1> Kant did not think that we could know.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#17:1> However, he did notice something very curious: it isn't just that we

apply the principle of cause and effect to phenomena, it is that we apply in

a certain way.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#18:1> In phenomenal reality, cause and effect are applied in a continuous

series.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#19:1> Every effect has a cause, but every cause also has a cause, and so

forth, ad infinitum.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#20:1> This adds up to a philosophical principle of determinism, that

everything is causally determined to act in a certain way.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#21:1> Kant believed that science sees things that way, but we do not, for

the idea of free will contradicts determinism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#22:1> Free will involves a free cause, i.e. a cause that is not determined

by some prior cause.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#23:1> We can also call that an unconditioned cause, since it is free of a

prior causal condition, and it occurred to Kant that a characteristic of

phenomenal reality was that everything was conditioned by something else.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#24:1> In that, Kant hit upon the same point that had been made earlier in

Buddhist philosophy: in the reality that we see, everything is conditioned by

everything else.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#25:1> One example of this in Buddhist thought is the doctrine of Relative

Existence or No Self Nature: Nothing has a essence, nature, or character by

itself.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#26:1> Things in isolation are shûnya, " empty.?
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#27:1> The nature of things only exists in relation to everything else that

exists.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#28:1> Existence as we know it is thus completely relative and conditioned

by everything else.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#29:1> Only Nirvâna would be unconditioned, although we cannot know what it

is like. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#30:1> If an unconditioned cause cannot occur in phenomenal reality,

then it could only occur among things-in- themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#31:1> But for all we know, even if cause and effect do apply among

things-in-themselves, determinism may even be true there also.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#32:1> Other kinds of unconditioned objects, like God or the soul - - God is

not conditioned by anything, and the soul is free of most of the conditions

of phenomenal reality, like corruptibility - - might also exist among

things-in-themselves, but we cannot be sure about that either.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#33:1> Thus, Kant did not believe that it was possible to prove things about

things-in-themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#34:1> If we try to do so, we create what Kant called " dialectical

illusion," involving contradictions in reason itself, e.g. between

determinism and free will, which Kant called Antinomies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#35:1> Kant 's Fourth Antinomy lays out equally compelling arguments for and

against the idea of a Necessary Being, i.e. a God.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#36:1> Nevertheless, Kant believed that the existence of things like God,

freedom, and the soul could not be disproved; and in the Critique of

Practical Reason ( 1788), he decides that the Moral Law provides us a basis

for making certain decisions about transcendent objects that mere theoretical

reason could not do.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#37:1> Thus, we believe in free will because we must if we are to use moral

concepts like responsibility, guilt, praise, blame, retribution, punishment,

etc.; for according to determinism, no one is actually responsible for their

actions, and scientific explanations will always reduce people to creatures

of remote causes, e.g. genetics, childhood, society, drugs, disease, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#38:1> All three of what Kant called the " Ideas" of pure reason in the

First Critique--God, freedom, and immortality--Kant comes to believe are

motivated as objects of rational belief, on the basis of moral

considerations, in the Second Critique. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#39:1> The next step towards Otto comes with an obscure post-Kantian

philosopher, Jakob Fries ( 1773-1843).
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#40:1> Friesian theory is little known today, but Fries does rate honorable

mention by perhaps the greatest recent philosopher, Sir Karl Popper (

1902-1994), who says, apropos of G.W.F. Hegel 's dialectical method: " For the

truth is, I think, that it was not at first taken really seriously by serious

men ( such as Schopenhauer, or J.F. Fries)..." [ Karl Popper, The Open

Society and Its Enemies Vol II, Princeton University Press, 1966 ( 1945), p.

27].
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#41:1> Popper himself, in his seminal The Logic of Scientific Discovery (

1934), says that he considers his own system of thought a successor to the

Friesian pattern, probably because Fries revived the Aristotelian principle

that not every proposition needs to be proven.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#42:1> Popper believed that scientific theories do not need to be proven

because they are actually falsified instead.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#43:1> As with Schopenhauer, Fries was attempting to come to terms the

problems in the Critical Philosophy of Immanuel Kant. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#44:1> Fries was not impressed by Kant 's arguments for belief based on

practical reason.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#45:1> Like Kant, however, he did believe that the notions of God, freedom,

and immortality are necessitated by reason.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#46:1> He concluded, in his Wissen, Glaube und Ahndung [ 1805; available in

English as Knowledge, Belief, and Aesthetic Sense, translated by Kent

Richter, Jürgen Dinter Verlag, 1989], that we simply must accept that these

concepts spring from theoretical reason directly as, indeed, a kind of

rational belief ( Glaube), which we will not be able to understand in the way

that we understand science or the world of experience ( what Fries called

Wissen, " knowledge").
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#47:1> On the other hand, Fries was put off by the bloodless rationalism and

moralism of Kant 's theory.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#48:1> Kant had provided a place for feeling in his system, in the Third

Critique, the Critique of Judgment ( 1790); but his view was that the

feelings of the beautiful and the sublime did not arise from any direct

relationship to external reality but only from a subjective harmony of our

own mental faculties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#49:1> Fries did not think such a theory was good enough.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#50:1> He thought that aesthetic and religious feelings were real cognitions

of their objects but that they existed in dissociation from any concepts that

would make them real matters of Wissen or understanding.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#51:1> Kant himself had earlier believed in such an aesthetic realism, but

he later decided that only morality related directly to things-in-themselves.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#52:1> Thus, after a fashion, Fries extended Kant 's own theory of the

mind: Kant had thought that experience arose from the synthesis, the active

unification, of sensations according to rules provided by pure concepts of

the understanding.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#53:1> Kant then figured that reason had some concepts, the Ideas of God,

freedom, and immortality, for which we have no corresponding sensations and

so no corresponding experience or understanding.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#54:1> Fries merely added that there are corresponding sensations, aesthetic

and religious feelings, but that synthesis, experience, and understanding

still do not actually occur between the sensations and concepts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#55:1> Fries calls these feelings that we have independent of reason and

understanding Ahndung, or " intimation.?
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#56:1> They are intimations of the transcendent. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#57:1> Where Kant had thought that it was only through reason and

morality that we are related to things-in- themselves, Fries adds that there

is a component of feeling to this relationship as well.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#58:1> Fries was thus bound to see religion differently from Kant.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#59:1> In Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone ( 1793), Kant had

reduced religion to a phenomenon of reason and morality.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#60:1> Kant believed, indeed, that morality was what religion was all about

and that it provided a basis for rational belief in concepts like God,

freedom, and immortality; but this provided no ground for any other aspects

of traditional religious practice, belief, or experience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#61:1> Fries was able to add an important component, that the central aspect

of religion was not so much reason as feeling.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#62:1> But Fries still provided little room for most of the traditional

contents of religion.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#63:1> Even though both Kant and Fries were, in some general and cultural

sense, Christians, there was nevertheless no reason in their systems of

philosophy to believe anything more than that Jesus Christ was a particularly

good moral teacher.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#64:1> Fries might make Jesus some kind of poet in addition, but there was

still no way that he could admit anything like traditional Christian views

about the status and function of Jesus in the nature of reality or the scheme

of salvation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#65:1> Indeed, Fries had a moral objection to the idea that Jesus might have

suffered for our sins and redeemed us from damnation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#66:1> Salvation itself could only remain an alien concept to both Kant and

Fries, but it is hard to see what something like Christianity ( or Islam or

Hinduism or Buddhism) could possibly mean as a religion without the idea of

salvation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#67:1> Kant and Fries thus both represent a strong sort of philosophical

rationalism, albeit one with much more room for something like religion than

the reductionistic materialism that became common in the 19th century (

continued and continuing among many in the 20th).
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#68:1> Fries himself was simply forgotten until rediscovered by a later

German philosopher, Leonard Nelson ( 1882-1927).
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#69:1> Nelson added little beyond lucid exposition and restatement to

Fries 's view of religion, but Nelson did introduce Fries to a colleague of

his at the University of Göttingen: Rudolf Otto.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#70:1> Otto had a clear sense that there was much more to religious feeling

than what his philosopher friend allowed through a sense of the beautiful and

the sublime.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#71:1> But he also thought that there was no reason not to add that extra

feeling into the very fine metaphysical and epistemological framework, the

theory of Ahndung, that Kant and Fries had actually provided.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#72:1> Thus, as a purely descriptive matter, Otto believed that we are

related to the transcendent, not just through morality, and not just through

the beautiful and the sublime, but through a sense of the holy and the

sacred, categories of value that are unique and characteristic of religion.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-005#73:1> Otto takes the Latin word numen, " the might of a deity, majesty,

divinity," and coins the term " numinous" to describe either religious

feelings or the religious aspect attributed by those feelings to experiences

and objects.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#74:1> He characterizes the feelings as involving 1) ultimacy, 2) mystery (

mysterium), 3) awe ( tremendum), 4) fascination ( fascinans), and 5)

satisfaction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#75:1> Unassociated with any objects, the sense of the numinous is a feeling

of " daemonic dread," a sense of the uncanny, frightful, eerie, weird, or

supernatural.
<ICE-USA:W2A-005#76:1> These feelings make us feel vulnerable and overpowered, what Otto

calls " creature feeling." </p> </I>
