<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#3:1> Teachers can open young minds to new ideas. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#4:1> That 's what makes being one a dangerous proposition. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#5:1> On April 1, 1957, Anne Millicent Cooper gave birth to the only

child that ever managed to survive the toxic environment of her womb.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#6:1> As she sat in her hospital bed, aching, tired and drugged, holding

that squinched-up piece of human flesh that was at once all-Anne and

not-Anne, she searched her daughter 's face for some sign.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#7:1> Grandma Cooper always said that a person had their name written all

over their face, and a wrongly given name was a tragedy that could twist

someone 's personality into improper and disastrous proportions.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#8:1> After the horrible events of November 1963, Grandma Cooper claimed

that Lee Harvey Oswald 's mother hadn't read his face right and so was to

blame for the events that had led him down the path to assassination. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#9:1> Anne sat, cranky from exertion, and marveled at the fact that her

baby had not yet cried.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#10:1> Even when the doctor had whacked her a good one to give her breath,

the baby had merely hiccuped with dignity and slowly turned from blue to pink

without a sound.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#11:1> Even now the baby lay quietly, her steely eyes focusing on Anne with

such intensity that it gave her the creeps. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#12:1> Years later, when Grandma would scold Anne for naming that

changeling baby wrong, Anne thought back to that Fools' Day and remembered

the grayness that belonged to the baby 's face, as if the sun had set and

impressed shadows over her features to leave a darkness that never lifted.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#13:1> That shadow had moved Anne, when presented with the birth

certificate, to carefully print Twilight Cooper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#14:1> No middle name.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#15:1> No father 's name. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#16:1> Anne had killed three children.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#17:1> Least, that 's how Grandma Cooper had seen it, though she'd never

actually use 'dthe word murder.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#18:1> Three children, all boys, had been conceived, nurtured, then poisoned

by some agent in Anne 's blood.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#19:1> As Anne sat numbly before the doctor while he explained the situation

again, sat wearing a sanitary pad and belt in order to stop the gush from her

uterus, she envisioned some thief, some spy, sneaking around her body, hiding

in shadows and ducking out of sight until it saw its chance and pounced upon

its prey.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#20:1> She was impressed by its cunning and tenacity.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#21:1> She did not mourn for these sons, sons that would have grown big and

strong and masculine.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#22:1> She didn't see the need. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#23:1> So once Anne had her Twilight, she and her baby and her mama and

her grandma settled back into their house, on the outskirts of Mason, North

Carolina, and tried to ignore the stares and whispers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#24:1> Nights, Anne would sit by the window, listening to the radio, and

wish for the big city, where a person could get lost in the crowd.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#25:1> Who would know who the bastards were?
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#26:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#27:1> Grandma Cooper said the word bastard referred to those who used

it, not those at whom it was aimed, but Anne noticed that Grandma stopped

going into town in the company of her family of women after Twilight was

born.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#28:1> Grandma seemed slightly afraid of Twilight, as did others.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#29:1> When she grew older, Twilight could enter a room and the waves would

part as they did for Moses.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#30:1> Grandma would stand in her kitchen, scrubbing the dishes and watching

that spook child do her homework at the table, but if Twilight looked up or

spoke, Grandma would avert her eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#31:1> Twilight was born with that witchy color of blonde-white hair, which

silvered as she grew.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#32:1> Anne read up on hair colors and dyes, but Twilight simply shook her

head as if that dismissed the subject.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#33:1> Anne supposed it did. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#34:1> Anne 's mama, Ruth, was the only person in all of Mason who was

not the least bit afraid of Twilight, who could look her in the eye, could

tell her no, could raise her voice to her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#35:1> Then again, Ruth wasn't afraid of anybody, said fear was a waste of

time that didn't serve anyone except them that wanted to be feared.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#36:1> Anne wondered if that included her daughter, if Twilight liked the

effect she had on others.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#37:1> Anne never had the nerve to ask, and Twilight never offered.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#38:1> When Twilight was ten years old, she left home.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#39:1> She and Grandma Cooper were watching a game show, and Twilight simply

got up from the couch, crossed to the front door, and left. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#40:1> Grandma didn't bother to sound the alarm until the next morning,

when Anne went to wake Twilight for school. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#41:1> " She ain't here.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#42:1> Ain't no sense calling for her." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#43:1> " What?
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#44:1> Where is she, then?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#45:1> " Walked right out the door yesterday afternoon." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#46:1> Grandma Cooper sounded so calm that Anne almost forgot to be

upset.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#47:1> " Where'd she go?" </p>

<p 'd<ICE-USA:W2F-018#48:1> Grandma Cooper shrugged.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#49:1> " Didn't ask her." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#50:1> And somehow, that almost made sense. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#51:1> Twilight was found the next day in Smithfield.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#52:1> Somehow she had managed to travel more than twenty miles down Highway

40.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#53:1> When asked by annoyed policemen and her bewildered mama and

exasperated Ruth, Twilight shrugged.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#54:1> Didn't matter how she got there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#55:1> Only Grandma Cooper agreed with her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#56:1> " She 's home safe, ain't she?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#57:1> And Anne supposed she was, although her scrutiny of her daughter

increased in intensity.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#58:1> Over the next couple of weeks, she watched her as if watching a

stranger, as if examining a paramecium under a microscope.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#59:1> Her clinical thinking about her flesh and blood didn't disturb her;

how else should someone think about their kin?
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#60:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#61:1> And so Twilight grew, doing as she pleased with the calm belief

that that was the way it should be, bewildered by others' reactions to her

willfulness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#62:1> She did not comprehend how someone else could decide how it was

proper for her to behave.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#63:1> She lived in the world behind her shadowed face and steely eyes, and

no one had ever been invited inside.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#64:1> No amount of force parted those doors, either, though Ruth bullied

and cajoled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#65:1> Anne simply watched, her hound-dog eyes testimony to her child 's

strangeness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#66:1> Grandma Cooper kept a wide berth around Twilight and only reacted if

the girl was disrespectful toward her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#67:1> No one had the right to be disrespectful to their elders. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#68:1> As a teenager, Twilight was fascinated by the physical difference

between herself and the other Cooper women.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#69:1> Grandma Cooper was tall and thick-boned, exuding an air of strength.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#70:1> Her gray hair still held hints of its former ebony color.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#71:1> Her skin was dark and tough from years of sun and hard work.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#72:1> Ruth resembled her mother, big and sturdy and dark.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#73:1> Anne was paler but in all other ways was Ruth 's daughter.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#74:1> All three had bright green eyes, while Twilight 's were gray. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#75:1> Twilight was thin, all angles and bones, and small.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#76:1> Her heart beat within her chest like a fluttery bird, and if she

looked in the mirror after removing her bra, she could see the movement of

its wings underneath her skin.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#77:1> Her hair was white-blonde-gray, and she seemed fragile, breakable

next to the workhorse women of her family.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#78:1> Yet wire and steel and bone reinforced her, and she would not break.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#79:1> Despite the differences that could only come from genetics,

Twilight never asked about her father.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#80:1> The Cooper understanding was that she had no father, and even after

she learned the facts of life from Becky Carlson, the perky snubnosed

cheerleader in her American Lit class, Twilight did not ask from whose sperm

she had come.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#81:1> It really did not matter.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#82:1> Twilight, as she watched children in town with their daddies, knew

relating to a father would be as foreign as committing that act that Becky

had whispered about, to be hot and messy and sweaty and connected to another

human being.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#83:1> Those things, sexual acts and fathers, were for other people. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#84:1> Twilight was meant for different things. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#85:1> Twilight also differed from the other Cooper women in temperament

and desire.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#86:1> She shunned Grandma 's Bible, Ruth 's relish for housekeeping, Anne 's

longings, for something better, something bigger.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#87:1> She could feel her eyes glass over when Anne talked of the big city

or Grandma quoted Bible verses at her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#88:1> But one day, when Twilight was fourteen, Grandma 's religion

penetrated.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#89:1> Twilight had once again aggravated Ruth to the point of rage and had

ridden the wave of Ruth 's loud words into the living room, where she found

Grandma Cooper seated on the couch.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#90:1> She was hunched over the Bible in her lap, rocking.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#91:1> Twilight started out the front door when Grandma 's words stopped her.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#92:1> " 'Through a glass darkly.' " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#93:1> Twilight turned and fixed her steely eyes on Grandma.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#94:1> " Excuse me?
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#95:1> " You see the world as those who have not found God, in shadow.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#96:1> " Yes, yes I do.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#97:1> Twilight disappeared out the door, not hearing or not caring to hear

the admonishment in Grandma Cooper 's words.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#98:1> As she walked down the dirt road that extended from the Cooper house

into Mason, she twisted the words around in her head.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#99:1> Yes, the world did seem dark to her, but wasn't it, truly?
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#100:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#101:1> Twilight met a man when she was seventeen, the chance meeting

being the catalyst that would start her motors, that would start the

propulsion that would move her far, far away from the Cooper land, from

Mason, from the South.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#102:1> His name was Wilson Carpenter, and she first caught wind of him in

the drug store after school one day in the fall of her senior year.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#103:1> She had stopped in for a soda and was seated at the counter, reading

William Blake, when she heard the voices of Ethel Milton and Rosemary Helms.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#104:1> Ethel was nothing but a nosy busybody, but </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#105:1> Rosemary was Reverend Helms 's wife.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#106:1> So Twilight listened, pretending to read, and heard them talking

about " that new fellow." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#107:1> " Just moved in last night," Ethel was saying.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#108:1> Ethel owned the town 's boarding house and so was usually the first

to meet any newcomer, since Mason did not boast a hotel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#109:1> Twilight supposed Ethel 's nature and the job had drawn together like

magnets.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#110:1> Gossips were well suited to live among the hub of the town 's

happenings and in fact were happy no place else. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#111:1> " Only brought one suitcase.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#112:1> Small little thing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#113:1> And so I asked him if he was having the rest of his things sent and

do you know, he said there wasn't any more.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#114:1> I mean I know men aren't the same about belongings, but really.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#115:1> One suitcase!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#116:1> >From her seat, Twilight could hear Rosemary 's murmur, and she

strained to listen. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#117:1> Ethel continued.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#118:1> " Yes, I know.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#119:1> Charming young man, too.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#120:1> So handsome.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#121:1> And you know it 's rare that a young man would want to teach.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#122:1> I mean, women have limited paths, but a man--" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#123:1> Rosemary spoke again, and though Twilight tried, she could not

hear the woman 's words.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#124:1> Mrs. Smith boasted a much softer voice than poor squawky Ethel. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#125:1> " Well, yes, I guess you're 'reht, but it would be different if

he was older.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#126:1> Twilight wondered where Ethel supposed older male teachers came

from, if sixty-year-old businessmen suddenly got the urge to teach Algebra to

pimply-faced junior high kids.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#127:1> " Or at least married," Ethel continued. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#128:1> " Well, there 's still time for that," Rosemary said, speaking

more clearly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#129:1> And Twilight silently praised her: Atta girl, Rosemary, project that

voice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#130:1> Ethel grumbled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#131:1> A gossip had more fun if the recipient of

what-might-turn-out-to-be-scandalous news agreed with her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#132:1> The conversation dwindled as the women began to speak of the

upcoming church bazaar, and Twilight tuned them out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#133:1> A new man.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#134:1> A teacher.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#135:1> Probably the lower grades, and probably a math teacher.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#136:1> Twilight wished she had caught his name. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#137:1> The next day, her English teacher, Miss Turner, did not show.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#138:1> After ten minutes of no supervision, the class was becoming

restless.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#139:1> Twilight read her book and ignored them, until she heard a deep

voice above the din.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#140:1> " Excuse me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#141:1> I didn't realize that a teacher 's absence was permission to run

amuck." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#142:1> The class grew silent, staring at this man, the young face that

could have passed for one of theirs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#143:1> He dropped his briefcase on Miss Turner 's desk with a loud thump

that even startled the unshakable Twilight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#144:1> " My name is Mr. Carpenter.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#145:1> I have been assigned to this class for the rest of the semester.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#146:1> Miss Turner will not be returning." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#147:1> Twilight, by carefully listening to Ethel, had learned that Miss

Turner was now resting comfortably in Raleigh, in a bed in a minimum security

ward of Dorothea Dix hospital.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#148:1> She had had some kind of " nerve thing," according to Ethel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#149:1> Twilight figured it must have been a nervous breakdown and wondered

if it had been student-induced. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#150:1> " Old Turner 's gone loony," one of the boys in the back called

out, and there were uncomfortable giggles throughout the room. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-018#151:1> Mr. Carpenter fixed the room with an icy stare.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#152:1> " I will not have such talk in my classroom.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#153:1> You will show as much respect to Miss Turner as you will show to me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#154:1> If any smart-aleck thinks he can best me, then he may leave right

now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#155:1> I will not play a game of wills with this class, and anyone who

attempts to rattle me will find his own cage rattled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-018#156:1> Is that understood?" </p> </I>
