<ICE-USA:W2B-020#1:1> <h> Political Correctness and the Fear of Feminism</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#2:1> A radical feminist argues that multiculturalism is a healthy

renewal of our best democratic traditions</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#3:1> Critics of political correctness have tried to promulgate the

preposterous myth that college campuses are dominated by radical

philosophers, literary critics, and historians who are attempting to coerce

their colleagues and students into accepting a monolithic system of left-wing

beliefs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#4:1> This charge has nonplussed radical professors, who are all too

painfully aware of their minority status, the chaotic and often discordant

heterogeneity of their views, and especially their relative immpuissance in

both campus and national politics.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#5:1> What pains me, as one of those radical professors, is not that the

political-correctness charges are unfair, misplaced, and totally outrageous (

although they certainly are) but, rather, that the whole PC controversy has

made it more difficult for those of us who deeply care about the real

suffering of real people, caused by the inequities and dysfunctionalities in

our society, to have our voices heard.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#6:1> The PC rabble-rousers have fortified existing social practices and

institutions against the sort of fundamental criticism that is essential for

any society to be responsive to human needs in rapidly changing

circumstances.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#7:1> How can this be happening?
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#8:1> There is an aphorism by Friedrich Nietzsche called " Ennoblement

through Degeneration" which I think sheds light on how a swirl of thoroughly

fatuous PC allegations can be treated so seriously by otherwise intelligent

people.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#9:1> Nietzsche says that, for a society to flourish, its members must share

a common faith consisting of deeply held, long-standing, and unquestioned

assumptions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#10:1> Those persons who are most susceptible to this suppression of

difference through the inculcation of the common faith are called <it> bound

spirits </it> by Nietzsche, and it is crucial to the health of a society that

they predominate.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#11:1> The danger to communities composed of bound spirits is what

Nietzsche calls " an increasing, inherited stupidity" ( this and other quotes

are from the Marion Faber translation of <it> Human, All Too Human </it> ,

University of Nebraska Press).
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#12:1> The problem is that bound spirits have little or no capacity for

creative and critical imagination--their minds are literally bound by the

common faith.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#13:1> Thus, for a society to progress and adapt to changing circumstances,

for it to stay one step ahead of stupidity, there is a need for persons who

are less bound, less confined by the moral certainties of their

society--namely, the <it> free spirits </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#14:1> " They are persons," says Nietzsche, " who try new things, and many

different things."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#15:1> Because they are less bound by the moral principles that partly

constitute the common faith, free spirits are perceived by bound spirits as

morally weak.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#16:1> The former are thus largely incapacitated as agents of change within

the community; therefore, innumerable free spirits die, Nietzsche says,

without ever having a noticeable effect on society.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#17:1> All in all, free spirits do make a difference, though:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#18:1> They loosen things up, and, from time to time, deliver a wound to

the stable element of a community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#19:1> Precisely at this wounded, weakened place, the common body is <it>

inoculated </it> , so to speak, with something new; however, the community 's

overall strength has to be great enough to take this new thing into its

bloodstream and assimilate it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#20:1> Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest

importance....
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#21:1> The strongest natures <it> retain </it> the type, the weaker ones

help to <it> advance </it> it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#22:1> ...
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#23:1> It is precisely the weaker nature, as the more delicate and free,

that makes progress possible at all...
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#24:1> [ However,] only when permanence is securely established and

guaranteed is there any possibility of constant development and ennobling

inoculation, which, to be sure, will usually be opposed by the dangerous

companion of all permanence: authority.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#25:1> When social authority succeeds for a time in squelching the

voices of social critics, the society will experience a consequent increase

in " inherited stupidity."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#26:1> Some contemporary examples of this kind of cultural torpor are

provided by Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#27:1> His proposals for dealing with the extraordinarily complex challenges

of an increasingly multicultural society include accepting only white

Europeans as immigrants, building a fence along the entire length of the

Mexican border, and having National Guard troops do their summer duty near

the fence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#28:1> His suggestion for managing the problem of homelessness is to throw

people who have no homes in jail.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#29:1> Of course, it is not the mere fact of Buchanan as an individual

saying these stupid things that exemplifies Nietzsche 's theory.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#30:1> Buchanan 's policy proposals grow out of some quite traditional and

widespread assumptions, and he is being taken seriously by established

institutions, including Republican Party officials and the news media.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#31:1> Pat Buchanan thus personifies the cultural torpidity that pervades

certain less adaptive elements of U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#32:1> society.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#33:1> A more complex and interesting example of the sort of stupidity

Nietzsche describes is the recent rise to fame and political clout of

Christina Hoff Sommers, a philosophy pro- fessor who has been certified by

the <it> Boston Globe </it> as a " critic of ` political correctness.'"<ICE-USA:W2B-020#>

Although Sommers, a professor at Clark University and a member of the

right-wing National Association of Scholars, may not be known generally, she

is quite notorious among philosophers working in the area of feminism as the

author of several articles, all quite similar in style and content, attacking

feminism generally and certain feminist philosophers in particular.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#34:1> Although three of these articles appeared in scholarly journals (

<it> Public Affairs Quarterly, Social Philosophy and Policy, and the Journal

of Social Philosophy </it> ) , they diverge markedly--and instructively, I

shall claim--from the range of tone and techniques usually found in

philosophy journals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#35:1> Sommers relies <it> primarily </it> on invective, sarcasm, quoting

out of context, misrepresentation, distortion, hasty and inapt

generalization, baseless speculation, unsupported claims, and

oversimplification.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#36:1> When she does ( on occasion) address the substantive points or

arguments made by the philosophers she wishes to criticize, she responds to

them with indirection and vagueness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#37:1> I should like to give examples of Summers' use of some of the

foregoing techniques.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#38:1> The cumulative effect will, I think, make Sommers look pretty bad,

but I want to emphasize that I am not claiming that Sommers herself is

stupid.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#39:1> However, her reactive way of dealing with serious philosophical

issues raised by feminist critics exemplifies the <it> cultural </it>

stupidity that Nietzsche says results when a society is deprived of the sort

of radical criticism that can keep it alert.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#40:1> Summers' use of invective is brazen and irresponsible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#41:1> For example, she refers to " the resolute and methodical

infiltration" of universities by feminists, disregarding the extraordinary

obstacles feminists have had to overcome ( quite openly)--including

well-established patterns of discrimination against women in general--in

order to achieve acceptance in universities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#42:1> The quote in question also deceptively suggests a level of success

that feminism has certainly not enjoyed in Sommers' own discipline, where

some graduate programs have no women at all on their faculties and only a few

have professors specializing in feminism.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#43:1> Sommers' reference to academic feminism as " a powerful but

sincerely anti-intellectual movement" is an all-too-typical example of her

use of invective in place of argument.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#44:1> The charge of anti-intellectualism is bizarre on its face, since

academic feminism is a movement of intellectuals engaged in intellectual

activity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#45:1> Sommers' only support for the charge consists of the following

passage:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#46:1> Susan Sontag talks of a " persistent indiscretion of feminist

rhetoric: anti-intellectualism" and, she says, she has felt the need to "

dissociate myself from that wing of feminism that promotes the rancid and

dangerous antithesis between mind ...
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#47:1> and emotion."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#48:1> Too many leaders of Academic Feminism promote that antithesis in the

manner in which they oppose male to female " ways of knowing."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#49:1> Both Sontag 's quote and Sommers' use of it are perplexing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#50:1> The distinction between intellect and emotion is not a pro- duct of

feminist theory; it is, rather, a centerpiece of the Western patriarchal

tradition and has in fact been <it> criticized </it> , not promoted, by many

feminist theorists.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#51:1> This passage serves as striking evidence of Sommers' ignorance of a

subject about which she has written so much.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#52:1> Sommers makes liberal use of sarcasm.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#53:1> Interestingly ( in light of the quality of her own work), one of her

favorite tactics is to dismiss a feminist claim as " embarrassing."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#54:1> She calls the belief that sex and gender have a pervasive, systemic

social influence a " prism"--thereby suggesting that it distorts reality--and

then speaks of those who take the sex-gender system seriously as having been "

properly fitted with the sex/gender prism."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#55:1> In response to feminist claims of the pervasiveness of the sex-gender

system, she asks: " What sort of sightings are being reported?"--thus

attempting to trivialize the extraordinary mass of statistical,

anthropological, and historical data that has now been accumulated on the

oppression of women by comparing it to UFO sightings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#56:1> Sommers even uses sarcasm to excuse her own ignorance of her

chosen subject: " There is a kind of feminism-of-the- week that one cannot

hope to keep abreast of, short of giving up all other concerns."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#57:1> About Simone de Beauvoir and " other feminist theoreticians," Sommers

says that " it is hard to see how one could count anything they say as a

discovery whose tidings will one day be believed by a world of objective

scholars."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#58:1> This passage is interesting not just as an example of Sommers'

substitution of sarcasm for argument but also because it demonstrates either

her ignorance of or cavalier attitude toward a major theme in twentieth-

century philosophy--the critique of " objectivity."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#59:1> Feminists' views are often misrepresented by Sommers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#60:1> For example, she claims that " the feminists advocate abolishing the

family."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#61:1> She does not cite a single feminist who in fact argues for such an

abolition, yet her usage of " the feminists" suggests that they all do.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#62:1> The attribution of various opinions and ideas to " the feminist," "

the feminists," " the academic feminists," and so forth, is among Sommers'

favorite ploys, creating the impression of a false uniformity in a field of

study noted for its diversity of viewpoints.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#63:1> Quoting out of context is another technique of misrepresentation

favored by Sommers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#64:1> She attributes to Sandra Harding, a distinguished philosopher of

science, " the speculation and hope that physics may someday be ` relegated

to the backwaters of knowledge-seeking.'" Checking the footnote reference, I

found the following passage in Harding 's book, <it> The Science Question in

Feminism </it> : </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#65:1> Physicists, chemists, philosophers of science, and most of the

rest of us believe that physics is the paradigm of science, and that science

without physics as its paradigm is unimaginable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#66:1> Minds reel at the suggestion that perhaps, in the science of the

future, physics will be relegated to the backwaters of knowledge-seeking and

thought to be concerned only with esoteric problems that have little impact

on how we live.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#67:1> Perhaps even today its problematics, methods, and favored languages

already provide distinctly atypical examples of scientific inquiry that

should not be models for other areas.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#68:1> We can entertain this thought even while we appreciate the historical

reasons why physics has been the paradigm of scientific inquiry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#69:1> This richly provocative passage, which fits quite respectably

into the tradition of critical philosophy of science, is reduced to

caricature by Sommers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#70:1> She has a proclivity for quoting out of context, with little or no

comment, leaving the orphaned passages to fend for them- selves without their

supporting explanations and arguments.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#71:1> Sommers tries to excuse this practice--as well as her tendency to

avoid actually analyzing the views of which she is critical--by saying that "

some of the positions are, to my mind, sufficiently off balance to fall by

their own weight, so criticism of them is served by mere citation."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#72:1> This quote illustrates the irresponsibility and lack of seriousness

with which Sommers approaches her subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#73:1> It also represents an attitude that could hardly be more at odds with

the Western philosophical tradition that she regularly takes pains to

venerate.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#74:1> When she does actually attempt to support her views, she

typically does so with phrases like " such evidence as we have argues for," "

we know that," and " we are now aware that."
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#75:1> In fact, she relies greatly on what she--or someone like her- "

intuitively understands." And she relies crucially on her own visions of "

what women want" and what " most American women are not in sympathy with";

among her main themes are the claim that feminists advocate changes that, in

her view, wouldn't automatically be popular with women as she knows them, and

the claim that feminists make criticisms of society that have not already

been made by women in general.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#76:1> Sommers makes a similar claim in a sentence striking for its

indirection through the use of the passive voice:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#77:1> The tension between the goals of academic feminism and the common

aspirations of women was reflected in the discussions of the Tenth Barnard

Conference on the Feminist and the Scholar, where it was noted that, within

the movement, heterosexuality has been viewed as " politically

incorrect."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-020#78:1> Aside from the fact that we could question the extent of Sommers'

knowledge of either " the goals of academic feminism" or " the common

aspirations of women," we must ask: " it was noted" by <it> whom </it> ?
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#79:1> By one person or by many?
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#80:1> In a plenary session or a small workshop?
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#81:1> And what was the response of the other conference participants?
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#82:1> And, likewise, what does " within the movement ...has been viewed as"

mean?
<ICE-USA:W2B-020#83:1> Has it been one person, a few people, or many people who have held

such a view?</p> </I>
