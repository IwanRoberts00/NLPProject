<p> 1a) In class, we defined language from a nativist/Chompskian point of

view as, " a universal grammar that all humans have," that is learned through

an innate language acquisition device and exposure.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#2:1> It is impossible to fully determine Beth 's linguistic competence ( her

unconscious knowledge of linguistic structure and rules) from a single

language sample, but I am able use this particular linguistic performance (

how she uses her linguistic competence in speech) to say something about her

current language usage.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#3:1> I believe that Brown would place Beth just past the two-word phase,

perhaps at the beginning of " later combinatory speech" due to the way she is

combining functors like my and that to string together simpler 2-word phrases

( Lindfors).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#4:1> For example, rather than saying " Peggy baby" ( agent + object), Beth

says, " That Peggy baby."
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#5:1> Rather than saying " I find" ( agent + action), Beth says, " I find

yours."
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#6:1> Beth has some working knowledge of possessives ( " my" and " Peggy

baby") and simple syntax.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#7:1> While pure nativists would only be interested in these child

utterances and word structure, Brown ( who was already expanding nativist

language theory) would insist that we look at the mother-child interaction as

well.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#8:1> Beth is not yet using inflectional endings, but if Nora 's numerous

imitations and expansions ( e.g. " That 's my baby."; " It 's Peggy 's baby?")

really scaffold her verbal progression as Brown suggests, this might be

expected soon in Beth 's linguistic performance.</p><p><ICE-USA:W1A-017#> 1b) Interactionists

like Clark and Halliday view language as " meaning potential."
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#9:1> For them, social interaction is both a component of and goal for

language construction ( Halliday).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#10:1> Clark 's use-based approach would insist that we look at both the

acquisition of structure ( see number 1) and function of language.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#11:1> For example, I notice that Beth 's speech often functions in a

regulatory or instrumental capacity.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#12:1> Beth says, " My," when Nora threatens to take her baby in order to

regulate Nora 's behavior.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#13:1> She responds, " I find yours," when Nora asks where her baby doll is

and proceeds to go look for it.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#14:1> She is attempting to get something done.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#15:1> Nora 's speech, on the other hand, is heuristic- she is " teaching"

Beth about teasing.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#16:1> In this respect, Nora 's role as " teacher" might be to enact a

teasing schema through her interaction with Beth.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#17:1> Even though Beth fails to understand that her mother is teasing her,

and this could be " thought of as failed attempt to construct the adult world

view ( Halliday, p. 122)", Beth is learning through language to construct her

own reality.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#18:1> For example, in this interaction, she seemed to learn something about

sharing and pretending.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#19:1> She also responding to commands and questions and takes turns

speaking with Nora. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#20:1> 1c) When I consider Beth 's communicative competence ( or her

situational ability to effectively convey meaning), I need to think about her

linguistic competence, cultural practice, and the particular communicative

event, which are all demonstrated through her linguistic performance ( Class

Notes 9/23/09).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#21:1> It becomes important now to know that Beth is part of a working class

European American family.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#22:1> Heath 's research found differences in the way white working-class

communities, black working-class communities, and middle-class communities

talk to their children.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#23:1> This communicative event between Beth and Nora could be seen as a

teasing event or a caregiver socialization event, which I suspect are more

popular cultural practices in working class homes than in middle-class homes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#24:1> Through play, Nora is teaching ( and Beth is learning) about what it

means to be a caregiver, and how to effectively engage in teasing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#25:1> 2a) The interactionist theory of language could potentially judge

Cindy as " verbally deprived" in language because in the school language

sample she uses very short sentences ( e.g. " A dog", " I dunno"), doesn't

demonstrate mastery of the concept of what a dog is ( the teacher doesn't

understand why he doesn't have legs), and doesn't convey logical thoughts (

Adger, pp. 74-75).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#26:1> When the teacher asks Cindy to tell her about a part of the picture ( "

What 's this bit here?") Cindy simply responds with, " I dunno."
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#27:1> You can trace this line of thinking to interactionists reviewing

single interactions in school settings, particularly between teachers and

minority students, without a consideration of socio-cultural factors. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#28:1> 2b) Possible reasons for Cindy 's varied language behaviors

include that she has learned avoidance techniques for speaking in school,

where her language can be held against her and/or that there is a mismatch

between Cindy 's and the school 's interaction styles ( Adger, p. 76).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#29:1> Since, " schools generally align with the cultural traditions

associated with the middle class" ( Adger, p. 73) and Cindy is from a working

class family this is likely to be the case.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#30:1> For example, the purpose, channel of communication, and interaction

rules are different in this school speech event than in the home speech event

described ( Hymes).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#31:1> The purpose of this school event is to quickly describe Cindy 's

drawing, the channel of communication is written and oral Standard English,

and the interaction rules follow a traditional teacher question-student

response format.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#32:1> On the other hand, the purpose of this home interaction is inquiry

driven and purposeful- Cindy wants to figure out how to make the water in her

garden stay in the ground.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#33:1> The channel of communication is an informal oral Standard English.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#34:1> The interaction rules are different too.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#35:1> Cindy is allowed to ask questions and talk through her thinking,

rather than answering directed questions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#36:1> When these differences in the elements of the communicative events

are examined, it is not surprising that her language behavior varies so

dramatically in these situations. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#37:1> 2c) Cazden et al. might advise Cindy 's teacher to improve the

quality of her talk by, " shifting [ her] role and behavior"from that of an

interviewer to that of a resource for children to draw upon" ( p. 120).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#38:1> The teacher should be at the center of a free exchange of ideas,

rather than a requester of information she already knows.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#39:1> She might also encourage the teacher to develop a warm and trusting

relationship with Cindy, and to design a curriculum focused on cultural

pluralism that draws on what children already know and that allows for

authentic inquiry into meaningful tasks ( Cazden, pp. 120-124).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#40:1> For example, she might use her knowledge that Cindy loves gardening

to design science inquiry experiments or let Cindy and the other students

teach each other about their areas of " expertise."
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#41:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#42:1> 3a) As discussed in question 2b, the nature of communicative

events has the power to optimize learning and language opportunities,

particularly if it matches students' home/cultural interaction styles and

expectations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#43:1> In this ESL module, the teacher is both building on and expanding

familiar language practices for her students- she asks them to move from

writing their opinions about a topic that matters to them ( a familiar

writing task) to eliciting information from others and reporting on what they

have to say about it ( a new writing task).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#44:1> She asks her ESL students to interview other native language speakers

( familiar interactions) and students and teachers who speak English as a

first language ( likely unfamiliar interactions).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#45:1> She carefully scaffolds the entire module to build on familiar

language activities in order to expand students' repertoire to include the

unfamiliar.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#46:1> I also thought the purposes and mood of the communicative events in

this module were critical to enhancing learning opportunities.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#47:1> Some of the purposes included capitalizing on students' experiences

and creating an authentic and meaningful writing project.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#48:1> The mood was positive and celebratory of bilingual identities and

experiences.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#49:1> The teacher clearly sought to capitalize on students' languages and

cultural competence to enhance learning when she structured this module. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#50:1> 3b) In this ESL module, students learned language by constructing

meaning ( rather than acquiring structure) throughout the entire research and

writing process.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#51:1> As the students spoke and wrote in English they concurrently built

all parts of the three-level system Halliday described where " meanings are

coded into wordings and wordings are recoded into sound" ( p. 115).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#52:1> Students learned through language ( or constructed reality) as they

built positive bilingual identities, and discovered new methods to gather

information and structure writing.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#53:1> They learned about language ( " coming to understand the nature and

function of language itself", p. 16) by explicitly exploring various

functions of language and bilingualism. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#54:1> 4a) The first thing I would suggest to middle school teachers

responsible for crafting a language policy is to create their own definition

of language based on research.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#55:1> To do this, I would ask them to explore the differences in language

beliefs in the linguistic and teaching communities.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#56:1> I think it is important that teachers ( like students) are allowed to

create meaning, rather than having it pushed on them by " experts."
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#57:1> That said, I would try to ignite a discussion about language in

schools.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#58:1> I would let them know that while prescriptive grammar ( a cultural

construction that often involves explicit teaching of the grammar " rules" of

Standard English) is often taught in schools today, it has no linguistic

basis.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#59:1> The " standard" English that they were likely taught, is really just

the " socially preferred dialect" ( a social or geographical variety of

language) of American society ( Adger).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#60:1> However, there is nothing that makes this particular dialect ( or any

language, for that matter) inherently better than any other.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#61:1> I would also point out to them that everyone speaks a dialect, and

that spoken and written languages vary greatly in formality.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#62:1> I would expect some push back from Mr. Clark at this point, who would

likely claim that Standard English is actually better than other languages

because it has rules and we read it in books.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#63:1> He might cite technology as the current culprit of the degradation of

Standard English.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#64:1> I would respond by telling him that linguists are interested in

language rules, and that all dialects have rules that people adhere to when

they speak, even " nonstandard" Englishes ( socially unacceptable dialects;

e.g. AAVE).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#65:1> I might refer him to the Ebonics debate and remind him that published

writing has traditionally been maintained by the same elite group that uses

standard English.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#66:1> I would tell him that linguists, who study descriptive grammar (

objective analysis of language structures and differences), would be

interested in analyzing the structure and function of the language of

technology rather than judging it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#67:1> 4b) Linguists believe that language is primarily learned through

interaction, not direct instruction.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#68:1> To help teachers understand this idea ( that " implicit" teaching

occurring through interaction is more effective than " explicitly" teaching

sets of syntactic rules) I might ask them to recall their own experiences

diagramming sentences and " learning" grammar.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#69:1> Chances are, they have forgotten everything and/or have very strong

negative reactions to experiences with direct grammar instruction.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#70:1> " Explicit" grammar instruction is often not effective, enjoyable, or

functional.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#71:1> " For educational purposes we need a grammar that is functional

rather than formal, semantic rather than syntactic in focus, oriented towards

discourse rather than towards sentences, and represents language as a

flexible resource rather than a rigid set of rules" ( Halliay, p. 124).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#72:1> I might direct them towards resources such as Writing in Rhythm by

Maisha Fisher or The Power of Grammar by Mary Ehrenworth, where the authors

show possibilities for learning the " rules" of Standard English ( i.e. "

grammar") through modeling, interaction, and inquiry rather than the

traditional direct instruction approach.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#73:1> I would expect Mr. Clark and other middle school educators to bring

up the valid point that inquiry and discussions take time, and time is

something in high-demand during NCLB-era teaching.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#74:1> My best advice on this is that the quick and easy way is rarely more

effective or worthwhile than the long and difficult one. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-017#75:1> 4c) Finally, I would focus on the great language debate in

schools today, which concerns the speech practices of particular

non-mainstream cultural groups ( Genishi & Dyson).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#76:1> I would remind teachers that their implicit and explicit beliefs

about language affect children 's identity development, interactions, and

opportunities to use and learn language.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#77:1> I would urge teachers to " embrace the normalcy of difference" (

Genishi & Dyson, p. 237) and to view students' languages- whatever they may

be- from a capacity, rather than a deficit, framework.
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#78:1> To help teachers understand the competences their students bring, I

might suggest that they plan varieties of " recurrent, interactive events"

where they can really listen to students ( Genishi & Dyson), that they listen

to students in both classroom and non-classroom settings, and/or that they

conduct research in their own classrooms to gain insight into their students'

language patterns ( Adger).
<ICE-USA:W1A-017#79:1> The teachers will likely notice that their students, particularly

minority students, have amazing communicative flexibility ( ability to adapt

their dialects to communicate effectively in varying situations). </p> </I>
