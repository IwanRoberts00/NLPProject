<ICE-USA:W2C-002#1:1> <h> Summary: Graffiti spreads through Portland faster than officials

and residents can cover it up </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#2:1> Robbin Mayfield and his graffiti-removal crew drive an old

Wonderbread truck, but paints and solvents have replaced breads and

pastries.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#3:1> The truck pulls up to a wall in Southeast Portland where

Mayfield 's crew Had spent 2 1/2 days covering up the 6-foot blue lettering of

the Hilltop Hustlers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#4:1> But the gang came back to the wall at St. Andrews Residential Care

Center - - and that means a return trip for the cleanup crew as well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#5:1> Graffiti are spreading through Portland faster than kids go

through pens And cans of Krylon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#6:1> " It 's increasing and becoming bigger," said Valerie Thorneycroft,

who coordinates graffiti patrols in her neighborhood.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#7:1> " If we get one more gang in town and they start writing on the walls,

we're goi 'reto have a problem." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#8:1> Some neighborhood groups patrol weekly in order to keep up.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#9:1> " It 's just like chicken pox.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#10:1> If one kid gets it, the others are going to get it," said John Canda

of the Youth Gangs Task Force, which works to keep youngsters out of

gangs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#11:1> Although graffiti are associated with street gangs in inner North

and Northeast Portland, police and neighborhood groups say the problem has

spread throughout the city and has shown up in many forms.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#12:1> Sgt. Neil Crannell of the Portland Police Bureau 's Gang

Enforcement Team said graffiti fall into four main types:</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#13:1> <h> *Gang graffiti.</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#14:1> Graffiti that communicate between gangs and members or designates

turf.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#15:1> <h> *Tagging.</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#16:1> So-called graffiti artists who put their names - - or " tags" - - in

as many places as possible.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#17:1> <H> *Lovers' graffiti.</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#18:1> Graffiti that say, basically, " Billy loves Susie." </p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#19:1> <h> *Junk graffiti.</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#20:1> Anything that doesn't fall into the other categories.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#21:1> Call it art or call it argot, graffiti spell expense for cities,

Tri-Met, merchants and schools.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#22:1> Mayfield said his Youth Gang Graffiti Project receives

&dollar;75,000 from the Private Industry Council and about

&dollar;50,000 from a Housing and Community Development grant.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#23:1> Catherine Merten, public information officer for Tri-Met, said

the Agency spends

&dollar;2,000 on graffiti removal out of its

&dollar;200,000 budget for cleaning Its 788 neighborhood shelters.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#24:1> Joe Thomas, operations superintendant in charge of street

cleaning, estimates the city of Portland spends

&dollar;75,000 a year on cleaning graffiti and on vandalism.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#25:1> The Portland School District does not break down its maintenance

budget into categories, but officials say graffiti removal does add to the

cost.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#26:1> " These people aren't being responsible.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#27:1> They're c 'reing the taxpayers thousands and thousands of dollars,"

said officer Dennis Dodd of the Portland School Police.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#28:1> " Graffiti is vandalism plain and simple." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#29:1> The Youth Gang Graffiti Project was established three years ago

to provide troubled youth with basic working skills and to help fight

graffiti in the city.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#30:1> The project receives money through a Housing and Community

Development grant, the Private Industry Council and donations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#31:1> The youngsters, who work six hours a day Monday through Friday,

reach the program through the courts or probation officers, while others ask

to join.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#32:1> clean up all graffiti as quickly as possible, they are most

concerned about gang graffiti because of the message the markings convey.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#33:1> " Graffiti talks to the wannabes….<ICE-USA:W2C-002#>We work hard to eradicate

that graffiti," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#34:1> Dodd of the school police explains the longer gang graffiti stay

on the walls, the longer people have to react to it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#35:1> Dodd pointed to graffiti on a garage door and explained that the

number 187 referred to the California penal code for murder.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#36:1> " That means somebody is going to get hurt," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#37:1> Graffiti art, a longtime problem in New York and Los Angeles, is

making an appearance in Portland in a form called tagging.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#38:1> Dodd said the so-called taggers put their street names, or tags,

on walls in their room, outside and inside schools, bus shelters and anything

else that has a flat surface.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#39:1> Taggers are mainly junior high and high school age youngsters who

create names like the Art Fiends, Creative Devils and Sadistic Writers for

their groups.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#40:1> They also cover walls with words done in large, colorful letters

or with drawings of characters.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#41:1> Dodd classifies the taggers as a group, rather then a gang, but

said the distinction was a fine one.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#42:1> " In one respect, they have to fight their way in and out of the

group, but they haven't shot anybody we know of," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#43:1> Dodd knows many of the taggers and arranged for a retired tagger

to talk to The Oregonian.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#44:1> Joe, who wouldn't give his last name, formed the now-defunct

Creative Devils last Christmas.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#45:1> He said he started tagging as an Art Fiend but left after getting

jumped by another gang.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#46:1> " I thought 'the Art Fiends' were getting to be too much like a

gang," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#47:1> According to Joe, now 15, kids join a group, or crew as they call

it, because it is a challenge to see who can tag the most. He said the goal

of the Creative Devils was to see if they could 'get up," or tag, more then

anybody else.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#48:1> They also see graffiti as an art form, he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#49:1> Joe and his crew of four tagged by day and night while constantly

staying on the lookout for police and rivals. " Everybody hated us because we

were 'getting up' ruthlessly,'" he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#50:1> The winner is chosen for the quality and originality of the work.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#51:1> " Everybody could tell who the winner was by the drawing," Joe

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#52:1> After tiring of his encounters with police and rivals, he decided

it was time to quit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#53:1> Joe spent time in the Donald E. *Long* Home for juvenile

delinquents after he was arrested for writing on MAX.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#54:1> " It got me to thinking about what I was doing," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#55:1> While Joe says the rival groups never come to blows, the writing

on the wall looks ominous to Dodd, with the school police.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#56:1> In the Bloods and Crips, a name crossed out on a wall means the

gang or individual is going to get hurt.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#57:1> Taggers are starting to cross out the names of rivals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#58:1> " It 's just a matter of time," Dodd said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#59:1> Businesses and residents, meanwhile, tire of cleaning up.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#60:1> Thorneycroft, a pioneer in graffiti-removal patrols, started

cleaning her neighborhood two years ago.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#61:1> A retired accountant from Nabisco Brands Inc., Thorneycroft patrols

her neighborhood at least twice a month.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#62:1> Her efforts have not gone unnoticed.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#63:1> This month she will receive two civic awards recognizing her

relentless effort to address the graffiti problem.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#64:1> Mick Chase, board member for the Hawthorne Business Association,

said his group works closely with Thorneycroft to encourage businesses to

clean graffiti off their buildings.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#65:1> " I think our businesses have a certain pride of ownership and don't

like to see the graffiti around here," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#66:1> John MacLeod, 56, a retired financial analyst for Bonneville

Power Administration, got tired of seeing profanities written on a new

overpass near his home in the Parkrose area.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#67:1> He now covers the graffiti with paint supplied by the state highway

division.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#68:1> The Southeast Uplift Neighborhood Program operates on donations

and a

&dollar;2,600 grant from the Oregon Community Foundation.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#69:1> The grant, received in the 1989-90 fiscal year, bought supplies for

residents to use to clean up graffiti, said crime prevention organizer Peg

Caliendo.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#70:1> The group put together a brochure telling people how to organize

cleaning programs and deal with graffiti.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#71:1> Helen Cheeks, crime prevention coordinator for Southeast Uplift, said

Tri-Met has given the group blanket permission to clean up graffiti on its

property, but the Postal Service hasn't.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#72:1> Tri-Met suggests groups or individuals should check before taking

it on themselves to clean up the graffiti.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#73:1> The Postal Service, meanwhile, is trying to smooth the way for

individuals and organizations to clean postal boxes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#74:1> " We welcome the assistance in removing graffiti, but the details

of the policy haven't been ironed out yet," said postal spokesman Bob Groff.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#75:1> He said details of a new program, Adopt a Box, should be completed

soon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#76:1> Residents worry about what the blight of graffiti says about a

city.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#77:1> " Graffiti makes you feel dirty or like you're 'rea foreign

territory.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#78:1> You feel invaded, and you're 're sure of who 's behind you when you

walk down the street," said Roylene Carlson, a Southeast Portland

resident.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#79:1> " It 's sad because children are becoming gang members. Portland

has never had a problem like this before," she said. " I'm f 'mm Chicago, and

Portland is starting to get that look and feel." </p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-002#80:2> <h> INTENSE SUPERVISION, ELECTRONIC MONITORING AMONG ALTERNATIVES

WEIGHED TO DETENTION </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#81:2> Colorado courts are locking up teen-agers at skyrocketing rates

despite a drop in the number of juvenile crimes, according to a new

study.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#82:2> Experts in juvenile justice say that means the state must either

spend millions of additional dollars expanding prison capacity or take a

fresh look at alternatives to incarceration - an approach the legislature

appears close to endorsing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#83:2> According to many experts, there is substantial evidence to

suggest that some of those alternatives are more effective than jails in

deterring young people from becoming career criminals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#84:2> In the past five years, the number of juveniles Handed long-term

sentences has jumped 28%, and &percent;he numbers of youths re-sentenced has

burgeoned 170%, acco&percent;ding to a study by the Colorado Division of Youth

Services.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#85:2> Part of the reason for the rising rate of incarceration may be

more diligent police work and rising community intolerance of criminals.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#86:2> More arrests are leading to the filing of more charges and to more

convictions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#87:2> But many experts also say that juvenile offenders are

increasingly being treated like adults.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#88:2> That, they add, is more likely to create adult criminals than to

deter young people from crime.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#89:2> " Some kids are dangerous and need to be locked up," said Denver

Juvenile Court Judge David Ramirez.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#90:2> Detention, he added, is " very easy and very cheap, and the public

doesn't mind that. But they will grow up to be dangerous adults without

treatment." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#91:2> While juveniles are supposed to get counseling and other forms of

psychological and vocational assistance while they'r 'reocked up, crowding has

made it impossible for all or even most young delinquents to get the services

they need.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#92:2> Although the number of reported crimes by juveniles dropped 11.6%

in&percent;the past five years, the population of youths between 10 and 18 has held

steady.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#93:2> Yet court records show that the number of juveniles charged with

crimes statewide has jumped 41%.</p>&percent;
<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#94:2> " Police officers, and detectives are getting a lot smarter and

filing their cases a lot better," said Tim Turley, head of the Denver County

Juvenile Probation Department.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#95:2> " So more cases are being accepted by the district attorney." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#96:2> Other factors include better technology that allows police to

track down juveniles who fail to appear in court or to pay fines. And tougher

sentences handed down by judges are a direct result of the war on drugs and

gangs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#97:2> " They'r 'reeacting to the constituency who are tired of criminals

running around on the street," said Turley.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#98:2> 'The public believes that all criminals need to be locked up - that

probation is a slap in the wrist." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#99:2> Still, there is little evidence to support the idea that

offenders being sentenced to secure, long-term facilities all are sent there

for the most serious crimes.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#100:2> Of those sentenced to detention during the last five years, 61%

co&percent;mitted property crimes and 29% commi&percent;ted crimes against others.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#101:2> The remaining cases were for public order offenses, including

escape, drugs and weapons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#102:2> Those sentences were handed out since the legislature approved

funding for the design and construction of new detention centers for youth

after the Division of Youth Services submitted its long-range plan to the

Colorado General Assembly in 1985.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#103:2> Today, officials say they will need an additional

&dollar;63 million for more construction if the trend of detention for juveniles

continues.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#104:2> Officials project a need for more than 1,200 beds in four years.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#105:2> That 's 500 more than now exist, according to the study.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#106:2> With such numbers in mind, the state legislature in on the verge

of approving a measure aimed at keeping troubled youngsters outside of

institutions whenever possible.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#107:2> The senate bill moved out of the house appropriations committee late

last week.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#108:2> " Right now it 's been helter-skelter how some of these kids have

gotten into detention," Democratic Sen. Jim Rizzuto of Swink told his

colleagues.
<ICE-USA:W2C-002#109:2> " We now have youth incarcerated who don't belong in that

situation." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#110:2> The bill requires state and local officials involved with the

juvenile justice system to develop criteria by July 1, 1992, on which

youngsters should be placed in detention, and calls on counties to have

alternatives to confinement in place by 1993.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-002#111:2> Sen. Bill Schroeder, R-Morrison, argued that most of the

youngsters now in detention have " earned" their way into prison.</p> </I>
