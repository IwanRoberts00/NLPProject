<ICE-USA:W1B-017#3:1> <h> Re: Annual Report, 1994-95</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#4:1> 1. Content: Recent issues have included a pair of articles by

Atkins and Harvey on personal writing; articles by Phillips, Kearns, and

Fetterley and review essays Post-Lauria and Bailey in American literature;

<ICE-USA:W1B-017#5:1> We have published two symposia, on basic writing ( Laurence,

Rondininone, Gleason, Farrell) and on literature in the composition classroom

( Steinberg, Gamer, Lindemann, Tate, Peterson).
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#6:1> CE 's first article on deafness, Lennard Davis 's " Deafness and

Insight: The Deafened Moment as a Critical Modality." will appear in

December, 1996.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#7:1> Editorial Advisory Board: The six original members continue to

serve.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#8:1> 3. Staff. Associate Editor <@> Gia Pattone</@> W has resigned to

devote his energies to his two publishing concerns, Cambridge Wordwright and

Dipylon Press. Associate Editor <@> Giles Johnson</@> e, on leave from

teaching, now works full-time for CE. Poetry Editor <@> Tam Vuong<M/@> has

moved to California, where he teaches full time at El Diablo Community

College. Poetry Editor <@> Agnes McDougal</@> has become contributing editor,

and we have welcomed two new Poetry Editors, <@> Frank Beans</@> ( recipient

of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for his music criticism) and <@> Shawn Clay</@>.

Two graduate interns have finished their degrees; <@> Jonas Pray</@> now

works as an Editorial Assistant at Bedford Books, and <@> Siena Ford</@>

teaches secondary English in Great Barrington, MA. We welcome two new

graduate intern.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#9:1> 4. Correspondence with authors: Every author continues to receive

an individual letter from me, explaining the editors'--and for stronger

manuscripts, the referees'--responses to the manuscript submitted.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#10:1> A form letter is used for poetry submissions due to their number.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#11:1> 5. Electronic production and data base: Both continue as in the

last report.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#12:1> Omegatype typesets every issue from disks in one or two days, an

efficient means of editing and a money-saving measure for NCTE.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#13:1> Fila Awat</@>, as Dean of Graduate Studies, has agreed to

contribute

&dollar;9,000 extra per year to support two editorial interns:

&dollar;3,000 for the two semesters and

&dollar;1,500 summer stipend for each intern.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#14:1> These may be awarded as supplements to the regular

half-assistantships now used to support graduate assistants' research and/or

teaching.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#15:1> A student who both taught and edited would, then, receive a full

assistantship.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#16:1> While we may be happy to have the additional financial support

and the opportunity to offer students a unique opportunity for professional

development, we need to be watchful--as Sue has already mentioned to me--that

editing combined with teaching does not in the long run harm our graduate

students by retarding excessively their completion of the M.A.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#17:1> To that end, I would be glad to talk with you about any policies you

think we might need to establish about the awarding and duration of editorial

internships.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#18:1> At various phases of updating the ph.d. proposals, our Chairs

have collected information paralleling your committee 's interests.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#19:1> Janet would know if these updates could offer your committee a

shortcut.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#20:1> Meanwhile, I hope some of the following sentences may be helpful in

your project:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#21:1> 1) Through the study of literary genres and modes within their

historical and cultural contexts, scholarship and teaching in English Studies

at UMass/Boston prepares students for civic and professional life in two

crucial ways.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#22:1> First, close reading and analysis of literary genres ( such as epic

and movel) and modes ( such as satire and tragedy) takes place in literature

courses and in creative writing courses.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#23:1> The habits of detailed reading and of attention to form acquired here

carry over to students' understanding of oral and written genres in civic

discourse--such as political speeches and debates, sermons, position papers,

committee reports, journalistic reports and editorials--pertaining to

educational, social, environmental, and other civic issues.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#24:1> The understanding of genre and mode prepares students for

interpreting and constructing oral and written discourse in their

professional lives; for example, genre study pertains to occupations as

diverse as law ( structures of codes and classifications), social work and

medicine ( construction and interpretation of the narrative " case study"),

and education or business ( planning of curricula or production as solutions

to questions).
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#25:1> Second, because genre always functions within historical and cultural

contexts--ranging from a particular author 's religious beliefs and

friendships with literary patrons to the more general effects of gender,

class, and culture ( both intellectual and material) on who becomes and

remains an " author" at all--students gain understanding of factors

influencing the nature and extent of both an individual 's and a group 's

participation in civic and professional discourse: who writes letters to the

editor and who does not?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#26:1> why does one group become dominant in organizing a community literacy

center, and how can other groups be encouraged to participate? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#27:1> Composition Studies complements literary studies, enacting Paulo

Freire 's metaphor that " reading the word" is " reading the world.?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#28:1> Research in Composition Studies addresses many questions: what are

the relations between reading and composing processes?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#29:1> what are the processes of language acquisition and change within the

university 's various disciplines and beyond in the discourses of various

social, occupational, and professional communities?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#30:1> what can the history of rhetoric and of composition pedagogy reveal

about how processes of oral and written composing have been understood?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#31:1> Undergraduate students can approach these and related questions

through courses in advanced composition and professional writing as well as

in the theory and pedagogy of composition.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#32:1> They can apply their learning through internships ( in journalism,

advertising, publishing, and other fields) and through tutoring writing

one-to-one.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#33:1> Graduate internships are available at College English and in

co-teaching with a faculty mentor, the latter leading to supervised teaching

in the Freshman English program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#34:1> 2) Since 1992, the English Department has housed College English,

the journal of the College Section of the National Council of Teachers of

English ( NCTE), with Louise Z. Smith as Editor-in-Chief.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#35:1> This scholarly journal has a wide readership, with a circulation of

over 15,000 member subscribers ( excluding " pass along" readers) of whom

11,000 are college and university faculty, 1500 are student members preparing

to teaching in English Departments, and 3000 are college and university

libraries; over 14,000 are domestic subscribers, and about 900 are

international.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#36:1> The journal includes scholarly articles, book review essays, and

other features comprising 900-950 pages per year ( excluding advertising and

announcements).
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#37:1> College English provides a forum in which scholars working within any

of the various subspecialties of English Studies can address a broad

cross-section of the profession.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#38:1> Appropriate subjects are literature ( including nonfiction),

linguistics, literacy, ciritical theory, reading theory, rhetoric,

composition, pedagogy, and professional issues.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#39:1> No area is more welcome than any other, as long as the topic is of

general interest within the profession and the treatment is accessible to

scholars whose particular expertise lies in other areas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#40:1> Contributions add new knowledge, challenge received opinion, or

simply inform a larger readership fo the implications of scholarship and

research that would otherwise be known only to specialists.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#41:1> An important difference between CE and specialized journals in these

fields is that articles in CE must have a broadly conceived significance for

teaching. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#42:1> As in October, I write once more as an individual and not as

representative of the CAS Senate or any committee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#43:1> The newly revised proposal and executive summary answer many of the

questions I raised in my 10/22/96 memo, particularly my questions 2b, 2e, 3,

4, 6, and 7.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#44:1> Perhaps you can help me with one small and two larger questions,

numbered to correspond to your December 9th memo:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#45:1> 2. Relation between Deans' memo of 5/16/96 and revised CJP

12/2/96: Your sentence, " The proposal now incorporates that memo," seems to

me too broad a response to my October memo 's
#1 question.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#46:1> The revised proposal preserves the governance structure ( 4)

described in the Deans' May 16th memo item
#2.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#47:1> But the CJP alters and clarifies the credit/transfer policies that

were so confusingly described in item
#3.c of the Deans' memo.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#48:1> That alteration should be explicitly recognized.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#49:1> We don't want
#3.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#50:1> c coming back to haunt us.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#51:1> While I have always agreed with the philosophical justifications

of the program and, through the clarified CJP, have come to understand the

Sociology Department 's " strategic" needs vis-a-vis the APR, as well as

students' strategic needs for accredited programs leading to jobs, I still

have one question: Why will the Commonwealth support two programs, one in

CPCS and one in CAS, that are both accredited by the Police Career Incentive

Pay Program ( CJP I.A. ? 4) and Massachusetts legislation ( your 5th bullet).

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#52:1> The CJP now makes much clearer the reasons for CPCS 's excluding

what the earlier CJP proposal described as " younger students..." from CAS.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#53:1> I now understand that the CPCS students in Criminal Justice are

already well-along in law enforcement careers and that CPCS 's admissions

requirements with regard to age differ from CAS 's ( by about 3 years).
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#54:1> However, inasmuch as the CJP requires these two constituencies to

study together in seven core courses ( 21 of the 39 credits), the difference

in the CPCS and CAS admissions requirements becomes moot.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#55:1> Why can't CPCS just formally change its admission requirements for

this program?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#56:1> I think you're 'rexing two different " strategic needs" here: those of

the Sociology Dept., and those of the larger institution.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#57:1> I realize that the CJP doesn't describe compensation, but that

doesn't explain to me why the CJP Director, unlike other program directors,

won't be compensated.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#58:1> As for the Trustee Dean, why doesn't extra work deserve and get extra

pay?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#59:1> You write that the new program is not " situated between two

colleges" (
#3, 2nd bullet) and that that CJP does not " introduce" intercollegiate

collaboration (
#3, 5th bullet).
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#60:1> In other words, collaboration has been going on for some time, right?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#61:1> If so, why do we now need a new and complicated administrative

structure described in the new CJP ( III.B)--alternating trustee deans and

directors--in which neither College 's governance has prevailing

responsibility and in which the Provost becomes involved in micro-managing

disputes between the two deans?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#62:1> It is this 50-50 arrangement that places the proposed program outside

either college ( by placing it inside neither): besides the seven shared core

courses, that 50-50 structure brings " between" and " inter-collegiate" mind.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#63:1> The 50-50 arrangement leads to peculiar situations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#64:1> For instance, CJP III.A says ( good news!) a full-time CAS Sociology

line is on the way; but III.B says the CPCS trustee dean will be in charge -

- so a CPCS dean approves a new CAS hire? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#65:1> The five-person executive committee ( CJP III.B) could well

include both CPCS and CAS faculty and still come under one or the other

college.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#66:1> The spirit of each college 's governance body presiding over its

own courses and faculty ( CJP III.B) concerns might be hard to achieve when

the 50-50 plan is in place.
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#67:1> At the very least, it 's an extra layer of complexity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-017#68:1> Isn't there a simpler way?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#69:1> Why not leave the CPCS program in CPCS and house the new CAS major in

CAS under Liberal Arts Dean?
<ICE-USA:W1B-017#70:1> By emphasizing the proposed CJ major as a CAS major but then

providing a whole new administrative structure, the CJP seems to me

self-contradictory.<ICE-USA:W1B-017#> You should follow through with this as you see

suitable; I trust you will let me know if you have any pressing concerns.</p>
