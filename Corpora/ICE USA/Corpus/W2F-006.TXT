<ICE-USA:W2F-006#1:1> <h> Journey</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#2:1> <h> by Celeste Moure</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#3:1> We sat there next to each other for a good two hours, at least,

before saying anything.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#4:1> And that was just fine with me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#5:1> I'm not much of a talker a 'mway.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#6:1> I especially didn't want to have to exchange any words with this

woman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#7:1> You know how it is, you're stuck sitting ne 'reto a person and you know

you're gonna be there f 'rethe next ten hours.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#8:1> Now some people feel like they might as well make a friend or

something.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#9:1> I'd rather just 'dit there in silence.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#10:1> Maybe read a book.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#11:1> It wasn't like I even wanted to be here anyway.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#12:1> I would have much preferred to stay back on campus, hang out with a

few friends, catch up on some work I had to do for my psychology class.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#13:1> Instead, somehow, I don't know how, I ended up buying a plane ticket

at the last moment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#14:1> I guess it must have been my mother.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#15:1> She 's been buggin' me about this for years.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#16:1> " Julian I really think you'd have a goo 'dtime if you went back." "

Your grandparents really do miss you, Julian.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#17:1> How about a short visit, eh?" and so on.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#18:1> Actually, I was the only one of us who hadn't gone back after what

happened.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#19:1> My parents went back almost every year.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#20:1> And my brother had been back many times.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#21:1> But then, he was too young to remember what they did to my father.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#22:1> After we left the country I never went back because when the

opportunities arose there was always some other thing I had to do.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#23:1> During summer breaks I was always working, and obviously I couldn't

just get up and go.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#24:1> And then during the winter breaks I wanted to go skiing with friends

or something like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#25:1> In any case, airfares are really expensive in the winter.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#26:1> And also, it 's not like I know many people back there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#27:1> Except for some family.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#28:1> I really couldn't imagine that going back was anything I wanted to do

any time soon. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#29:1> This woman, though, I could tell she was real excited about going

back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#30:1> She kept looking out the little oval window ( even though there

wasn't much to look at), then looking at me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#31:1> Then when the food came I guess she felt the need to say something.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#32:1> " Now let us pray," she began after the little tray s were set in

front of us.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#33:1> I looked at her, my mouth agape.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#34:1> I imagined some sort of a long sermon about thanking our lord above

for this food in front of us.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#35:1> Something like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#36:1> " Pray it 's not fish.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#37:1> I'm allergic to fis 'm" she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#38:1> " Oh," I said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#39:1> There 's not much you can say to that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#40:1> Hey, I don't like key lime pie, you don't hear me making a big to do

about it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#41:1> We peeled the foil back from the little dishes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#42:1> It was chicken, potatoes and snow peas.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#43:1> A chocolate chip cookie for dessert.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#44:1> I guess we were both pretty hungry because we dug in immediately.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#45:1> " So, you from Buenos Aires originally?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#46:1> " Uh huh," I said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#47:1> She nodded and took a bite of her cookie.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#48:1> A slow eater, that one.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#49:1> She washed that down with some coffee.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#50:1> From time to time she'd turn he 'dpale round face toward me, brush her

thin blond hair from her eyes, ask me something.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#51:1> What did I do?
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#52:1> ( I was a student at the university.) How long had it been since my

last visit to Argentina?
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#53:1> ( Almost ten years.) Didn't I miss it?
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#54:1> ( Not really.) How come it had been such a long time?
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#55:1> ( No particular reason.) Finally, when I thought she was beginning to

run down, I reached down for a bag underneath my seat and took out a book.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#56:1> She wasn't having any of that. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#57:1> " Buenos Aires has changed a lot.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#58:1> It 's really beautiful...
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#59:1> at this time of year especially.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#60:1> Not too hot, not too cold, know what I mean.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#61:1> All the flowers budding, the leaves starting to come out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#62:1> She smiled at me, so I smiled back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#63:1> When she smiled little crow 's feet formed by her eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#64:1> She had these big brown eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#65:1> They looked like chocolate does when it 's just melted.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#66:1> Smooth and deep.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#67:1> She was probably quite a bit older than the thirty-odd years I had

given her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#68:1> She went on to describe how much the city had changed in the past ten

years I hadn't been there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#69:1> She described everything from the economy and education to some of

the new buildings in the downtown area, to the change she noticed in the

people every time she went back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#70:1> Maybe she told me all this because she sensed my uneasiness about the

journey I was making.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#71:1> Maybe she just liked to hear her own voice. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#72:1> She said how much she admired some of those people, some people

she knew and some others she had never met.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#73:1> " After all that 's happened it 's a wonder some people still live

there, going forward with their lives, trying to succeed in whatever it is

they're doin 're she said </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#74:1> I know more about those things than you can imagine, I started to

tell her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#75:1> She went on to tell me that for her going back to Buenos Aires once a

year was more like a healing process than anything else.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#76:1> Her friend had died.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#77:1> " I guess around the time you left the country.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#78:1> About ten years ago, that 's right," she said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#79:1> And then, " God...
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#80:1> has it really been that long." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#81:1> She keeps telling me about her friend and how hard it was for her

to come back after he died.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#82:1> She left everyone and everything behind and moved to Europe for some

time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#83:1> She tried to go back to Buenos Aires some years after.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#84:1> She even made all the arrangements, then at the last minute she

decided she wasn't going to get on that plane.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#85:1> " I couldn't, you see, because I still felt that it was in some way

my fault.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#86:1> That I had killed him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#87:1> Coming back would have been too painful; seeing all the places we had

been, where we always met on Thursday nights for coffee, the theater where we

worked, the park where we had picnics on Saturday afternoons during the

summer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#88:1> All the memories we had.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#89:1> She looked away and was quiet for a few minutes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#90:1> I thought she was crying, and I wanted to tell her that it wasn't her

fault. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#91:1> Then suddenly she turned her face to me and she was smiling.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#92:1> She said, " I was finally able to come back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#93:1> It was hard but I came back, and that first day I visited our café.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#94:1> And you know what, I cried.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#95:1> But it was OK because I finally realized that it wasn't my fault.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#96:1> And now I look forward to going back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#97:1> And I walk around the city to all the places we used to go, and

sometimes I discover some great new café or bookstore." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#98:1> I try to think back and remember this beautiful city she 's

talking about.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#99:1> But all that comes to mind is the day that they broke into our house.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#100:1> You see, my father was a professor at the university.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#101:1> In those days professors and students were a threat to the military

dictatorship.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#102:1> Many people disappeared; some were taken in for questioning and then

released.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#103:1> Others were beaten up and killed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#104:1> Sometimes if I close my eyes I can see it all clearly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#105:1> I remember the noise of wood breaking.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#106:1> I lay in bed for a few minutes after that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#107:1> Then my mother screams and I jump out of bed and out into the hall.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#108:1> Four men in uniform are dragging my father out of bed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#109:1> With a club they hit my father on the back of the legs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#110:1> I see them throw him down on the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#111:1> They kick his legs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#112:1> My mother runs out to the hall, she screams, she implores.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#113:1> Another one kicks his stomach again and again. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#114:1> My father tries to get up but they're no 'reone. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#115:1> Stop, stop! my mother begs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#116:1> Not yet.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#117:1> They kick him again and again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#118:1> Then they pull him up and hold him in mid-air - - not quite standing

and with his knees barely touching the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#119:1> You're ma 'reg a mistake, my mother screams at them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#120:1> But they don't hear her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#121:1> They hit him on the side of the stomach, then using their hands.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#122:1> Up against the wall and bang over the left ear, then bang over the

right ear.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#123:1> They shake him and hit him against the wall and hit him on the face

again. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#124:1> And then they stop and drag my father out through the living

room to the front door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#125:1> And they leave. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#126:1> I remember my mother on the phone talking to a lawyer, to her

friends, to anyone who might be able to get my father back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#127:1> At night I would lay in bed with her and listen to her crying softly

on the pillow.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#128:1> For a week it was like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#129:1> And then one day my father just walked in the door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#130:1> With bruises all over his face and body.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#131:1> He was lucky, many others never came back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#132:1> Not long after that my parents got their visas approved to go to

Spain.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#133:1> We never came back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#134:1> Or at least I never did. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#135:1> At night I dream that I'm wal 'mng alone down a crowded street.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#136:1> I turn in circles over and over again hoping to recognize something.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#137:1> On all sides are tall buildings that sparkle and shine with

advertisements for Coca-Cola, Nike and Marlboro.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#138:1> People are walking hurriedly by me, sometimes pushing me aside to

get by.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#139:1> I look at all the people rushing past but their faces are not

familiar.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#140:1> I open my mouth to ask for directions but no one sees me, and it

doesn't matter because I realize that I have nowhere to go.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#141:1> I stand in the corner of a busy intersection for what seems like

hours.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#142:1> And I feel like crying.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#143:1> Then across the street I see my grandmother and mother.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#144:1> They wave to me and signal me to go over to them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#145:1> But the street has nine lanes and the cars are going too fast.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#146:1> I wait and wait but the light doesn't change and I can't cross.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#147:1> Then from behind me someone grabs my hand and I turn around and it 's

my father.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#148:1> And together we start to cross the street.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#149:1> And then I wake up. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#150:1> The plane 's lights are still dimmed and everyone around me is

still asleep.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#151:1> From the little oval window I can see the first of the sun rays

reach out to me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#152:1> As the sun makes its way up the light blue sky some people around me

start to wake up and talk in agitated murmurs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#153:1> Then the whole plane is awake and people are excited as they hear

the pilot 's voice say that in twenty minutes we'l 'lle landing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#154:1> Hundreds of miles below tiny houses and buildings start appearing

everywhere.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#155:1> From up here all looks peaceful, quiet.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#156:1> The woman next to me, Clara, writes her phone number in a little

piece of paper. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-006#157:1> " If you want someone to show you around, I 'd be more than happy

to.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#158:1> There are so many beautiful places to visit in this city - it 'd be a

pity to leave without seeing some of them," she says to me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-006#159:1> I smile and put the paper where I 'm sure not to lose it. </p> <&>
