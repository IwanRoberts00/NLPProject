<ICE-USA:W2E-008#1:1> <h> A TALE OF TWO CITIES - - WITH MOST ON THE OUTSKIRTS</h> The

Griffin legacy can best be described as a tale of two cities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#2:1> Frank Ciminelli described Griffin as a can-do guy; Bob Rich claims

history will treat James Griffin kindly.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#3:1> Both Ciminelli and Rich benefited greatly over the last 16 years.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#4:1> The other tale comes from the " average Joe," the middle-lower income

individual; in other words, the vast majority of the people who live in

Buffalo.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#5:1> Griffin 's policy over the last 16 years was downtown at the

expense of everything else.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#6:1> Yes, we built a few buildings downtown.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#7:1> I say " we" because the citizens paid through the nose.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#8:1> How?
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#9:1> Tax abatements, free grant money, low-interest loans, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#10:1> What did we get?
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#11:1> Nothing except low-paying jobs, empty offices, no major league team.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#12:1> In other words, nothing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#13:1> Our neighborhoods have suffered the most as a result of this

philosophy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#14:1> A few became richer and many became poorer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#15:1> Second, the Griffin administration never understood that our

children are our most important resource.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#16:1> Griffin has kept the Board of Education in federal court for most of

the last 16 years.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#17:1> Griffin had nothing to do with the success of the magnet schools.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#18:1> However, his administration has had a lot to do with the poor

condition of our inner-city schools.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#19:1> His commissioners have been found guilty or have been accused of

stealing from the Parks Department and the children 's lunch program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#20:1> We should guarantee our kids quality housing, recreational

facilities and, most importantly, schools.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#21:1> Third, the Griffin administration failed miserably on the ethical

issues, mainly because the administration is racist.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#22:1> People of color and/or not the right ethnic background were left

out.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#23:1> People have become disenfranchised.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#24:1> The result is a disastrous crime rate, especially among our

youth.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#25:1> The Griffin legacy is one of separation and despair.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#26:1> History will not treat James Griffin kindly but fairly.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#27:1> His administration will remain in the ash heap of history, where it

belongs.</p>

<ICE-USA:W2E-008#30:1> <h> Buffalo</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#31:1> <h> SCHOOLS HAVE TO FACE UP TO PUPILS' TROUBLED LIVES;</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#32:1> <h> STATE SHOULD FORCE ATTENTION TO KIDS' PROBLEMS</h> IDEALLY,

teachers should walk into a classroom full of eager and attentive students

and help them gain skills in math, science, English and other academic

subjects.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#33:1> In too many instances, though, that is not the reality.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#34:1> Students often come to school preoccupied, hurt or terribly torn

by a myriad of social problems, including family breakdown, abuse, poverty

and lack of any meaningful mental stimulation at home.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#35:1> Some of them require lots of encouragement and individual attention

to focus their minds on their work.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#36:1> Others need more.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#37:1> That is why it 's encouraging that the state 's Special Commission

on Educational Structure, Policies and Practices recently recommended, among

other things, that nearly two-thirds of New York schools be required to set

up " family resource centers."
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#38:1> They would provide a wide range of assistance to troubled

families.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#39:1> Schools in which more than 20 percent of the students are

eligible for free or reduced-price lunches would be required, within three

years, to hook up with community agencies to provide prenatal and parenting

education, health and social services, job counseling and help for those with

alcohol and drug problems.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#40:1> The social services system is now so fragmented that many

students and their families are bounced from agency to agency or simply go

without appropriate care.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#41:1> Educators may object to yet another state mandate and to the

financial and administrative headaches involved in setting up school-based

social service agencies.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#42:1> But because the alternatives are so grim, a state requirement should

be given serious immediate consideration.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#43:1> Studies on educational reform often cause an initial stir and then

simply gather dust.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#44:1> This one deserves better.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#45:1> In fact, many schools already recognize the need to expand their

traditional roles.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#46:1> Kentucky has more than 300 school centers.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#47:1> New Jersey has at least one in every county.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#48:1> Locally, Sweet Home Central Schools set up a family resources

center this year.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#49:1> Its center parallels what is recommended by the state.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#50:1> That program was created after a survey in which 73 percent of

the Sweet Home teachers who responded identified lack of student motivation

as a serious problem.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#51:1> Sixty-four percent cited angry, aggressive students as a detriment to

learning.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#52:1> " We're get 'reg to kids and parents we weren't reaching before,"

said Gary R. Cooper, district superintendent.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#53:1> " The program is working."
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#54:1> There are other good examples in Western New York of schools trying

to help students overcome the problems that come between them and

learning.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#55:1> The Buffalo school system has anti-drug counselors at some high

schools, runs a school for unwed mothers and runs training courses in

conflict resolution for students and teachers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#56:1> The Williamsville Central School District has an alternative high

school that provides individual attention for students who have academic,

disciplinary or adjustment problems.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#57:1> But more needs to be done to deal with the personal troubles of

troubled students.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#58:1> The state report offers one possible answer.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#59:1> At the least, it should cause a search for other ways to help

students who too often end up on unemployment lines, as high school drop-outs

or as victims of the cycle of poverty and abuse.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#60:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#61:1> <h> BRING BACK THE ENGINEERS;</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#62:1> <h> IT'S WRONG TO DILUTE TOP PUBLIC-WORKS JOBS</h> SEVERAL local

governments in recent years have removed engineering qualifications from

top-level jobs in the public works field.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#63:1> That 's an error.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#64:1> The notion seems to be that people with some sort of

administrative ability can handle the jobs without having the technical

background.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#65:1> But the public would be better served if the people heading

governmental units concerned with buildings, roads, bridges and pipes had

engineering training and experience.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#66:1> How can they command others in the field if they lack the technical

knowledge and don't know the language of the trade?
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#67:1> How can they make the proper judgments about safety?
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#68:1> How can they keep from being fooled?
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#69:1> Some examples: In 1988, Buffalo juggled the City Charter

qualifications for the job of commissioner of public works so that David P.

Comerford, a non-engineer and a political ally of Mayor Griffin 's, could be

appointed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#70:1> Previously, the appointee had to be an engineer.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#71:1> Now, as administrations change, the Erie-Niagara Chapter of the State

Society of Professional Engineers is urging that a professional engineer be

appointed by Mayor-elect Anthony M. Masiello.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#72:1> Sure, the society is following its own self-interest, but that

doesn't keep it from being right.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#73:1> While the Charter doesn't require an engineer, it doesn't prohibit

one from being appointed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#74:1> Masiello should find an engineer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#75:1> In September, the Buffalo Sewer Authority, controlled by Griffin,

dumped its time-tested requirement that its top staff job, general manager,

be held by an engineer.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#76:1> Comerford was duly appointed, probably making it possible for him to

survive the change in administrations for a time.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#77:1> The next general manager should be an engineer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#78:1> In February, the Niagara Falls City Council dropped engineering

requirements for public works director, and Dick Lucinski, a local television

reporter, was named.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#79:1> There is now a Council resolution to restore the qualifications.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#80:1> It is spearheaded by a Democrat opposed to Republican Mayor Jacob A.

Palillo, but, politics aside, the resolution is right.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#81:1> It says that knowledge of such things as concrete mixes, soil

bearings and reinforcing steel strengths is important for a public works

chief.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#82:1> Sometimes it 's a matter of public safety.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#83:1> Top public-works jobs should be filled by professionals in the field.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#84:1> To properly command their departments, they should be familiar by

education and experience with a range of technical matters that escape

untrained mortals.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#85:1> For instance, they should be able to discourse about tensile strength

without fumbling for a manual.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#86:1> Bring back the engineering requirements.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#87:1> <h> TIME FOR ALBANY TO RESIST ADDED CUTS IN SUNY BUDGET;</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#88:1> <h> PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HAS BEEN HURT ENOUGH</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#89:1> LEADERS AT THE State University of New York and its flagship

Buffalo campus have a problem.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#90:1> They have watched the system that is supposed to prepare the state 's

work force get squeezed by years of budget cuts, sapping much of its

vitality.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#91:1> Yet they can't scream too loudly for fear of scaring away

students and faculty.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#92:1> That leaves it up to state officials to recognize on their own

the importance of the SUNY system, and particularly the university centers

like UB.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#93:1> And it leaves it up to residents to demand that higher education not

be treated like an ugly stepchild in the state budget each year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#94:1> SUNY has lost 9 percent of its faculty, 5 percent of its student

enrollment and has eliminated 3,000 classes since 1987-88.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#95:1> That is hardly the way to maintain a first-rate public university

system.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#96:1> When students can't get the classes they want, have to sit in

overcrowded lecture halls or take five years to graduate, SUNY is on its way

down hill.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#97:1> Nor is UB immune to the problems affecting the rest of the

system.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#98:1> Hampered by union rules that restrict the ability to manage personnel

and by a budget structure that makes no allowance for negotiated salary

increases, UB officials say the campus has lost

&dollar; 28 million in real spending power since 1987-88, when inflation and the

salary hikes are factored in.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#99:1> That translates into fewer offerings for students.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#100:1> The problems are the same on other campuses, a fact illustrated

in an alarming Newsday series that took an in-depth look at SUNY 's many

problems last year.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#101:1> The 1994 budget will provide another for state officials to prove

that the promises made in the wake of that expose were more than just

rhetoric.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#102:1> SUNY officials are seeking a

&dollar; 1.5 billion budget, up 8 percent.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#103:1> That request comes at the same time that Cuomo has asked all

departments to come in with budgets 2 percent lower than needed simply to

hold the line.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#104:1> That sets the stage for one more showdown that will illustrate

just how well - - or how poorly - - Albany understands the role that higher

education plays in the economic and cultural life of a state.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#105:1> The SUNY request includes

&dollar; 10 million for graduate research facilities plus

&dollar; 5 million for auxiliary personnel and supplies necessary to attract

top-flight researchers - - and the outside grants they bring - - to SUNY.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#106:1> Given that every dollar spent on graduate research attracts

&dollar; 3.50 in outside funding, that seems a smart investment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#107:1> But thinking in terms of education as an investment takes a

foresight not always evident in Albany.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#108:1> UB officials - - who would get an extra

&dollar;13 million under the SUNY request, and about 40 percent of the research

money - - say they just want the state to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#109:1> Considering that no will exists to raise tuition in an election

year, SUNY is at the mercy of state officials if its programs aren't to be

gutted further.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#110:1> The budget to be unveiled next month by Cuomo and approved by the

Legislature must recognize that public higher education can't take more

hits.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#111:1> <h> LAME DUCKS HEADED SOUTH AMOS, WOYSHNER TOOK TAXPAYERS FOR A

RIDE</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#112:1> PUBLIC officials - - like everyone else - - can get in a rut.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#113:1> Ways of doing business can become so habitual that change is not

only difficult but hard to envision.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#114:1> The traditional way becomes the only way.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#115:1> So it 's a good idea for public officials to go - - from time to

time - - to state and national conferances about governmental issues.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#116:1> If they go with an open mind, putting business ahead of the

inevitable tourist attractions, they will return home with fresh ideas and a

broader outlook worth the cost of the trip.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#117:1> But what were two area lame ducks up to when they headed to the

annual conference of the National League of Cities in Orlando, Fla., at

taxpayer expense, a few weeks before the curtain falls on their tenure in

public office?
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#118:1> Archie L. Amos Jr. took the trip even though he lost his University

District seat on the Buffalo Common Council when he was relegated to an

independent line after pleading guilty to a fraud charge in connection with

his nominating petitions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#119:1> Leonard Woyshner took the trip even though voters last month

ended his 20-year tenure as the 3rd Ward 's representative on the Lackawanna

City Council.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-008#120:1> Whatever the two may have learned in Orlando cannot be

translated into a better performance as public officials because they won't

be public officials after Jan. 1.
<ICE-USA:W2E-008#121:1> Any added know-how they may have picked up in Orlando will do no

good to the taxpayers who paid the bill.</p> </I>
