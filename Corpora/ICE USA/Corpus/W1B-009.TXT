<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#2:1> Dearest daaarlink A, </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#3:1> Hi.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#4:1> I think I've reached new levels of procrastinat 've.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#5:1> I just spent a half hour putting on fake nails & then painting them

hot pink...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#6:1> boy, do I feel " LADY-LIKE." How bizarre.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#7:1> It must be a pain in the ass to have nails this long.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#8:1> Disabilling</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#9:1> Sowanyway things here are so fucking boring.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#10:1> I have a million and a half things to read, write, & in general get

done and it 's just not inspiring me at the moment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#11:1> However I'm longing to communicate c/ you because I kno 'mI've

been lax about the whole thing 'veout which I feel dreadful but you're in my

thoughts so much.
<IC 'reSA:W1B-009#12:1> I hope we can spend some time together soon...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#13:1> Boston sounds so inviting...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#14:1> actually-- time with you away from here sounds incredible.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#15:1> So, lets make some tentative plans for post-graduation time--- kay!

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#16:1> My life: school work ( of fucking course!) Ceramics ( YAY) - I

dreampt last night that I ate some clay...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#17:1> euuuu</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#18:1> did I tell you about this!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#19:1> It 's so hard to explain...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#20:1> " A QUERY INTO WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN" => stems out of " EST"

training.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#21:1> Ever heard of it!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#22:1> It 's a course that I'm taking next weekend in Lancaster c/ - - 'm & -

- - - ( a.k.a.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#23:1> " The dudester" - - roomate).
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#24:1> - - - did it...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#25:1> gosh, I can't remember if I told you about it or not.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#26:1> I probably did.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#27:1> Anyway-I'll tell you about how it g 'll later ( after I do it). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#28:1> So how 's the job search!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#29:1> How 's the social scene!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#30:1> Heard from your bro' yet!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#31:1> I hope you're doing well...
<ICE-USA:W1 're09#32:1> Hey - thanks for the contacts...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#33:1> really great stuff... </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#34:1> Hope you like the T.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#35:1> The smallest size we had was a large-- It'll probably shrink in th 'll
dryer a bit 'thou'</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#36:1> - - - ( the pizza guy) called me the other night and left a

message on my machine ~ never called back...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#37:1> odd, don't you think...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#38:1> good god, I hope he 's not pregnant.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#39:1> Ha haaahh.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#40:1> Woman, things are bizarre 'round here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#41:1> I'll dealing with too man 'llgo 's ( my ceramics prof in particular),

too much bullshit attempts at being social, & not enough heart to hearts, you

know ~ convo 's, __ NADA.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#42:1> Everyone I knew is gone.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#43:1> I mean, there 's - - - and all, but He 's in the BURG and it 's long

distance and I have no

&dollar; or ...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#44:1> to get there to see him and he 's working a lot and I have so much to

do anyway and I don't have time to make good friends ( as opposed to the many

acquaintances that I do have) and I have a problem with runnon sentences, not

to mention cross outs and spelling problems - - but it 's all besides the

point... </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#45:1> " I wish, I wish, I wish I was one of those BINGO women, you

know!

<ICE-USA:W1B-009#47:1> You'll have to see t 'll sometime.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#48:1> We have this on video ( - - - does) it 's a cross between Monty Python

and SNL.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#49:1> Bizarre, & very funny. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#50:1> Darling-I'm sorry this letter 's so 'misjointed.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#51:1> I'm just in one of 'dem mo 'ms.. 'd
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#52:1> not very conclusive about much.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#53:1> Things in general are okay-- mostly the same...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#54:1> I'm surviving.
<ICE-USA: 'mB-009#55:1> I'm hoping things are coo 'mwitcha.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#56:1> I love you a lot...
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#57:1> take care and keep in touch. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#58:1> Luv, me ( if you didn't know) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#78:1> Hey!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#79:1> How are you!!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#80:1> I have to apologize for not being in touch sooner, I've been real 've

busy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#81:1> I'm working on my res 'me in the computer center so I figured I'd

write 'dou a letter.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#82:1> I've been wor 'veg on an application for a program called - - - in

Maine for the summer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#83:1> It 's an artists' workshop program-I'm applying for a 'maid position on

staff at the studio.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#84:1> Also, I was working on a letter to a woman named - - - .
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#85:1> She is a very well-known ceramic artist.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#86:1> I'm writing to her 'mo see if she 's interested in having me as an

apprentice for the fall.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#87:1> I have absolutely no idea how things will turn out in either case.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#88:1> I want both!!! - - - - teachers at - - - - and her house ( where I'd

be 'dving if I got the apprenticeship) is about a half hour outside of New

York City.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#89:1> Pretty cool, eh!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#90:1> I also hear that she is an amazing cook.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#91:1> Japanese food, of course. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#92:1> I've been 'veking two jobs ( well, actually three including the

studio, but only two paying jobs).
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#93:1> I work lunches as a waitress at a very fancy Billiard Parlor and

Saloon called - - - - right downtonw in - - - - .
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#94:1> It 's about a three block walk from my house. I'm also waitr 'msing at

the local Pizza Hut ( AAAAH!) A couple evenings a week.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#95:1> I hardly have enough time to be in the studio!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#96:1> The rent must be paid. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#97:1> So, how are things in Beantown!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#98:1> Keeping out of trouble!
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#99:1> Ha.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#100:1> I lost my voice this week.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#101:1> Boy, did I ever sound throaty.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#102:1> I think my tips were better at - - - - - - - .
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#103:1> Those lawyers from the Courthouse like a throaty-voiced waitress.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#104:1> Our uniforms at - - - - 's are really cool.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#105:1> We wear a tuxedo shirt ( complete with black buttons), black

suspenders and a black bow-tie.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#106:1> We are to provide our own pants or skirt, as long as it 's black.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#107:1> What 's really nice is that since I've l 've weight, I fit into my

Pierre Cardin black wool pants.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#108:1> Sharp.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#109:1> Plus, the best part about working at - - - 's is that I can play

pool for FREE!! ( While I'm on br 'mk). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#110:1> I was in the studio tonight and threw a little.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#111:1> The clay was really hard so I didn't get much accomplished.
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#112:1> I did get a chance to talk to - - - - about working with - - - - .
<ICE-USA:W1B-009#113:1> They are friends, so - - - will put in a good word for me. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-009#114:1> Well, I'm going 'mo head over to the library to do a little
