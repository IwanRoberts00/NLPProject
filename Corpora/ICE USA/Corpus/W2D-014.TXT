<ICE-USA:W2D-014#1:1> <h> HOW TO - Build a Scale Model </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#2:1> I enjoy models - - even since I was a young boy, though in my

younger years I lacked the patience, steady hands and delicate motions needed

to properly complete a model.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#3:1> This HOW TO will be a series that carries us from start to finish of a

model, starting with the most boring part - - understanding what you're

getting into 're what you'll need 'll get into it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#4:1> But, without this section, it is hard to really know what you're doing

or why 're/p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#5:1> Scale modeling is time consuming, and as a result this HOW TO will

be in several parts, the first being the most basic in that it will cover

selecting a model, thinking about paint layers and understanding the concepts

and challenges in scale modeling.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#6:1> Also, the length of this write up will significantly decrease the

length of the articles to come when we go through the actual building,

painting, and finishing processes over the next several weeks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#7:1> Be forewarned, building a model may feel like it drags on, but rushing

a job will result in a really low quality build.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#8:1> As I stated, this will likely be the longest of my HOW TO series, but

it is also the most important and will hopefully lay a foundation on the

things to come. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#9:1> The first thing to note is that with any scale model the idea is

to be as close to perfect as possible.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#10:1> This adds to the amount of time it should take to build one.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#11:1> Things like how much detail a kit has, moving parts and the

complexity of the kit itself make dissolve any static timeline in scale

modeling. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#12:1> It really doesn't matter where your interests lie, be they

aircraft, cars, armor ( tanks and military vehicles), or ships ( wooden or

otherwise), each type of model has its own specific obstacles that surface on

all models of that type.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#13:1> As an example, a huge challenge in aircraft is understanding that no

aircraft will look 'factory fresh' unless the model is to look like a

restored museum item and therefore a lot of time and reflection will be

needed for weathering the paint job effectively.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#14:1> With that, determining where your interests lie is one step closer to

knowing or figuring out what brand of model to assemble.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#15:1> For me, it is cars and bikes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#16:1> So once, you've figured out what it 've you want to build, it 's

good to know who makes what and to what quality they make them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#17:1> I'll jus 'llo ahead and state for the record, that while I'm not

directly adv 'mtising for Tamiya, they are in my honest opinion the BEST

models that you can buy ( despite their very high price point).
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#18:1> As a result I'll mai 'll talk about the Tamiya brand and later HOW TO

articles will be on a Tamiya model ( of either the Yamaha YZR-M1 50th

Anniversary or Tamiyas newest release ( end of January), the Lamborghini

Countach LP500S - - I'll let 'llu decide which you'd li 'd me to go over) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#19:1> There are several reputable model manufacturers out there.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#20:1> Choosing a model largely depends on several factors, the first being

in what scale you wish to build.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#21:1> I build in two scales: 1/24 and 1/12 ( which are usually cars and

motorcycles).
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#22:1> The second factor being to what level of detail do you wish to

achieve.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#23:1> Some models are 'curbside' meaning they have no engine, just a closed

hood.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#24:1> Some models don't have steerable wheels, but most have rolling

wheels.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#25:1> Some models are molded in grey resin while others come with metal

plated or dyed parts.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#26:1> It just depends on what you want to achieve.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#27:1> Some manufactures only make models in certain scales or only make

them of certain materials . </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#28:1> The last thing that should be taken into consideration when

selecting a model is how well you know the item you are building.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#29:1> Some kits aren't as accurate as they'd ha 'd you believe.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#30:1> For instance I recently built my father a replica of his first car

when he was a teenager - - a 1966 GTO with the 389 Tri Power and the ultra

rare factory installed Ram Air, Hurst 4 on the floor shifter in Fontaine Blue

with Aqua interior.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#31:1> Aside from what he would reminisce, I knew VERY little about the car

and spent a month doing deep research on the car, saved 500 some odd pictures

of the inside ( interior and engine bay) and outside ( even the

undercarriage), what the extras for the car were, etc. prior to even starting

to build the model. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#32:1> Some of that stuff has no bearing if you know that these parts

won't be seen - - for instance you can glue a hood closed and forego the

engine when you really don't feel like messing with it ( but kits with

engines cost more so it 's like wasting money). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#33:1> The kit itself came with two side mirrors and Rally II wheels.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#34:1> The instructions called for the window trim to be flat black and the

stock six-pack wasn't configured correctly.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#35:1> Without research I would have never known that the 'six pack' had the

middle carb sitting higher than the outside carbs, the window trim was

chrome, Rally I wheels were stock not Rally II wheels ( Rally II wheels

weren't on the car until 1967) and the car only had a driver side mirror on

the outside, not two.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#36:1> The kit would have me build an inaccurate model - - which is not

acceptable to me. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#37:1> To fix large inaccuracies you've got to scra 've build them or

find a company who makes accurate replacements / enhancements ( and there are

many companies who do this, so don't fear too much if you find yourself in

this spot) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#38:1> First and foremost, the paint is a primary concern.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#39:1> Everything rests on the paint - - a bad paint job will overshadow any

other aspect of a model because it is the most visible feature.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#40:1> In order to ensure that the paint comes out well good preparation

materials are needed as well as just good preparation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#41:1> While at this point we do not need to apply paint it is important

to have colors and vehicles in mind.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#42:1> If you're buildin 're kit and want to use factory colors then you'll 'll
need to pick out those colors.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#43:1> If you're lookin 'reo do a custom paint job then you'll 'llso need to

pick those out.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#44:1> Certain colors look better on certain cars while other can completely

throw off the project.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#45:1> For instance you'll 'llobably not want to paint a 1989 Savanna RX-7

FC3S in Wimbledon White because it looks funny and because Wimbledon White is

a Ford color, not a Mazda color.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#46:1> You would however probably paint it Black, Red, Aluminum or White

since those were the factory colors that the car came in.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#47:1> You may even want to go totally custom and paint it something like

Mica Red fading to Mica Crimson with Metallic Black accents ( like lamp

covers, door guards and spoiler).
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#48:1> Anyway you want to paint a model is fine as far as color goes but it

is important to be aware that not all paint is the same - - in short paint is

not paint is not paint. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#49:1> Lacquer is thinner than acrylic and enamel but is subject to

chipping, fading , and is typically 'flat'.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#50:1> Lacquer dries very fast compared to enamel because the vehicle in the

paint evaporates.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#51:1> The vehicle in lacquer also softens paint below it and chemically

bonds to any pre-existing layers of paint.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#52:1> For this reason is it never a great idea to put lacquer over top of

an enamel or acrylic.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#53:1> Lacquer will cost you more money in the long run to use because it

requires that you seal it to avoid chipping and fading, but sealing it

deepens the color and gives a much better finish.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#54:1> Cleaning lacquer up is harder because it needs stronger chemicals

that can attack the plastic of a model, so lacquers are good for masked spray

work and base coats.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#55:1> Tamiya paints are never enamels... they're with 'reSpray lacquer or

bottled acrylics but are formulated to not react with other brands of enamel,

acrylic and lacquers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#56:1> Enamel is fairly thick and unlike lacquer the drying process can

take upwards of 2-3 days.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#57:1> Technically enamel doesn't dry so much as it simply hardens with an

outer shell forming within about an hour.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#58:1> Enamel doesn't soften the layer of paint below it but can be softened

by lacquer - - therefore again I stress that it is a bad idea to put lacquer

over enamel.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#59:1> The exception to this is clear coats.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#60:1> Enamel is typically semi-gloss ( egg shell or satin as it is

sometimes referred) or gloss.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#61:1> The thickness of enamel coupled with the time reduced amount of time

it takes for a shell to form over it makes enamel prone to 'orange peel' and

if not careful quite possible to fill in panel lines on accident.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#62:1> The clean up however is fairly simple as the chemicals used need time

to attack plastic.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#63:1> It 's also the easiest paint to strip off of a model when you're not 're
happy with the overall paint job.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#64:1> A couple of hours in degreaser and you'l 'llever know there was any

paint on it at all!
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#65:1> Testors makes all three varieties of paint and are really bad about

reacting to certain brands of lacquer over their own brand of lacquer, though

Tamiya and Mr. Color work well with Testors brands of paint. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#66:1> Acrylic paint is a double edged sword.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#67:1> It dries fast so it is best suited for detail work that isn't going

to take long, but it is usually water soluble so the cleanup is simple while

still wet.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#68:1> Once dry however, acrylics are like enamel and chemicals are needed

to remove them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#69:1> Also like enamel, acrylics do not soften the layer of paint below

them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#70:1> Acrylics are also very easy to dilute into 'inks', which in turn are

used to detail panel lines with 'loaded brushes' so that the model has more

dimension and realistic look.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#71:1> Acrylics are also almost always gloss and require a bit of stirring

because they separate quickly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#72:1> Tamiya metallic acrylics require being stirred every 7-10 minutes

and all of them require stirring ( or vigorous shaking) at every use but they

go down really well.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#73:1> Testors and Mr. Color acrylics don't need to be stirred as often as

Tamiya, but go down pretty thick which can cause brush strokes to be clearly

visible. TO summarize the concept of paint you should just simply remember

the order in which you want to put down your paint layers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#74:1> These are things to think about when you choose a model.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#75:1> Understanding in what order you'l 'lleed to apply colors saves a lot

of work and frustration in the end.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#76:1> Above all, make sure that whatever brand of paint you use, that it is

safe on polystyrene.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#77:1> Polystyrene is only one kind of model plastic but it is the most

common.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#78:1> Another common plastic is Polycarbon which is primarily used for RC

bodies and parts.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#79:1> Polycarbon paint will attack ( 'eat' is probably more accurate)

polystyrene as polystyrene is pretty much super condensed Styrofoam.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#80:1> Also, since lacquer and enamel have some form of urethane in them...

be smart about it and be in a well ventilated area ( like outside).
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#81:1> I'l 'llxplain more on painting when it 's time to paint the model. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#82:1> Preparing to build a model is more than just clearing table space

and a model.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#83:1> There are basic things you' 'llneed in order to ensure that your model

gets off to a good start. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-014#84:1> Sandpaper is probably the most underrated material you' 'llneed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#85:1> It 's used for removing 'pull lines' ( where the injector pills away

from the mold), swirls, flashing, and sprue ( a sprue tree is what each piece

is attached to prior to being cut away)connectors.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#86:1> Sandpaper is also used to finish paint jobs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-014#87:1> Typically one would use 3600 to 12000 grit for removing and reducing 'orange

peel' ( the tiny pits that appear in a spray paint job).</p> </I>
