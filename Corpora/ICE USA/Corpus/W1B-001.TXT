<ICE-USA:W1B-001#1:1> <h> February 19, 1990</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#2:1> <h> Dear<@> Mike</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#3:1> Dr. <@> Pickles</@> pointed out that John argues in this passage that

the evidence that we are indeed followers of Christ is that we love our

fellow-Christians.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#4:1> ( Read the passage for yourselves & see if you agree with him.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#5:1> I think he 's right.)
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#6:1> Also, if we live as a true family, loving one another, caring for one

another, and supporting one another, that is the most powerful testimony

possible to the transforming power of the love of Christ in a society marked

by isolation, individualism, and superficiality.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#7:1> For both of these reasons, the relationships among the staff are

crucial.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#8:1> He adds that he sees the main problems of our society, one of which is

drugs, as stemming from lack of self-esteem and unfulfilled needs for love;

thus, if people see that our self-esteem comes from Christ, and that our need

for love is met both by Christ and by the community of Christians, they will

sit up and take notice.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#9:1> I'm afraid I haven't captur 'm the power of what he said, but the raw

bones of it are here.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-001#10:1> Now for the frustrations--and I would really appreciate your

prayers about these.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#11:1> First of all, disorganization is rampant here at Harambee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#12:1> It 's not as bad as it could be, but to be frank, if I'd been in
 'dharge of our orientation, I could have easily cut out four or five hours of

meetings.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#13:1> For example, in terms of teaching us the schedule, what was really

needed was one comprehensive accurate schedule to be handed out, but instead

what we got was several incomplete schedule handouts and several inaccurate

word-of-mouth descriptions; there was lack of communication between <@> Dick

Pickles</@> and <@> Jim Wallace</@>, the co-directors, which resulted in many

mid-week changes; and the group of interns from Inter-Varsity were not with

us until near the end of orientation, which resulted in a lot of repeating.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#14:1> There were also problems with not getting some information to some of

the interns, so they were constantly asking questions that had been already

answered.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#15:1> Also, most of the interns are not very punctual people, so that

results in wasting even more time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#16:1> I was anticipating some lack of organization, so at the beginning of

the week I was pretty patient, but on Friday ( today) I got really

exasperated.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#17:1> I know that I'll be encoun 'lling more and more of this as the summer

goes on, so I am praying fervently for patience.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#18:1> I also have a lot of bureaucracy to face; I can't start a bank

account until I have a CA driver 's license, and I want to be licensed to

drive fifteen-passenger vans ( to transport kids around), but in CA that is

considered to be a commercial license with an exhaustive exam that 's

different from the regular driver 's test and involves learning a lot of

detail about auto maintenance ( which I'm happy to do, but 'mght now when I

want my license quickly is Spain).
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#19:1> Coming on top of today 's disorganization, this aggravated me further.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#20:1> Finally, the last straw at dinner today was being advised that it was

unwise for me to be out walking or running alone after dinner ( before dark,

even) on a Friday night, just when I most wanted to just bust out of the

house and really work off a lot of the frustrations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#21:1> No one else was interested in going out, and I would have preferred

to go alone anyway. So, I'm facing a lot rig 'm now, and of course it 's all

intensified by trying to adjust to a new place and new people on the heels of

four very intense weeks.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#22:1> I know, I am convinced, that there is an element of spiritual warfare

in all this, that the Enemy of God will use every little way of wearing me

down possible, that I must not allow these hassles to distract me from the

main issues .So, your prayers would be much appreciated.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#23:1> Prayer would also be really appreciated for the kids who are coming

to the day camp, that they would acquire self-confidence, self-discipline,

and self-esteem, a love of learning, and a love of God.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#24:1> That 's about the most that can be asked for them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#25:1> Please be praying for the staff too, that the eleven of us all packed

into one fairly small house and cooking & eating together could really be a

loving community,-that friction could be minimal and that mutual support and

encouragement could be maximal. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-001#26:1> Many of the same things are still issues, particularly building

community in the house.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#27:1> Last weekend, this was a real problem.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#28:1> Three of the house residents are still teenagers ( two high school

seniors and one recent high school graduate), and their level of

responsibility and maturity is on the low side compared to the rest of us.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#29:1> In addition, the ages here range from 17 to 30; there is also a

married couple with a little baby.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#30:1> You can imagine that the lifestyles desired by the eleven of us vary

greatly!
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#31:1> However, things have been better over the last few days.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#32:1> It 's easy to talk about how wonderful Christian community should be,

and how nice it sounds to be working in partners hip, but most of us assume t

hat we choose the people with whom we would live in such a community.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#33:1> The eleven of us did not choose each other, and probably would not

have given the choice.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#34:1> For that reason, I think we're lear 'reg a lot more than we might have

otherwise, and being challenged to love people whom we otherwise would not

have.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#35:1> So, I'm excited abou 'mthat even though there are nights when I just

want to take my dinner to my room rather than listen to <@> Jimson</@> and

<@> Solidad</@> rag on each other.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#36:1> I 'm particularly 'mxcited about the way this effort to build

community has brought me to my knees in prayer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#37:1> I recognize that it is something that God has to do, that we can' t

do by ourselves , and that demands faithful believing prayer .
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#38:1> <@> Ling</@> and I have been praying together before going to sleep

every night for half an hour or so, and it has been good.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#39:1> Prayer has knit us close together and helped us both keep our sanity,

and seeing answers to our prayers has reminded us both how faithful and good

God is.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#40:1> We've made 'vere to keep some of that prayer time for thanksgiving,

and that has also been very good.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#41:1> There has been so much to be thankful for, too!
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#42:1> Highlights of the week with the kids: the hardest thing, is to know

how much to be strict with them and how much we can just let them be kids

without their getting out of hand.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#43:1> They definitely have to be kept under tight rein, but, for example,

can they be allowed to run around playing tag without having it turn into a

pushing, shoving, and hitting free-for-all? These kids have a much lower

level of self-discipline ( as a whole group, that is) than any of the kids

I'm familiar wi 'm.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#44:1> Also, can they be allowed to just explore stuff that we put on the

tables during science class time--i.e. rocks, plants, shells, magnifying

glasses--without pushing and hitting each other, grabbing, not taking turns,

and so on?
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#45:1> Achieving this balance has been tough, and I certainly haven't done a

perfect job.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#46:1> I think I'm making prog 'mss, though.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#47:1> I would really appreciate prayers for two of the kids, Matthew and

Daniel.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#48:1> They are two of the brightest kids in our ( second grade) class.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#49:1> They are also the two least disciplined, at least so far. Daniel is

just plain disrespectful; Matthew has a really quick temper and no attention

span.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#50:1> With Matthew it seems that rather than deliberately flaunting

authority, as it seems that Daniel does, he just doesn't remember what the

rules are .
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#51:1> I've had 'vediscipline them both a lot, and I've had 'veot of

encounters with Matthew 's mother and two uncles.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#52:1> I'm very hop 'mul with Matthew,, because his two uncles are both

involved in his growing up to some extent ( both are Christians, married,

with kids of their own) and want to see him gain the self-discipline that he

hasn't been taught by his mother or his mother 's boyfriend.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#53:1> Both have disciplined him this week, which has helped.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#54:1> Daniel I'm less su 'm of .
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#55:1> I Im not sure what it will take to get him to respect me .
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#56:1> Anyway, God has made me able to really love these kids, at least most

of the time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#57:1> I really want to see them turn around this summer, and I hope that

they will.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#58:1> Other issues: I 'm not sur 'mif tljoki ( my co-teacher) and I are

doing a very good job with planning lessons .
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#59:1> Holding the kids' attention has been very tough, especially with f if

teen of them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#60:1> lie' ve been trying to do as much hands-on stuff as possible , and

we've be 'vedividing them into two smaller groups and each working with one.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#61:1> Some things have worked , some haven' t Please pray that we could

learn from our mistakes and learn to plan lessons that would be exciting for

the kids.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#62:1> Also, I'm findin 'mthe ( expected) difficulty of really fitting into

the black community here as more than a respected outsider.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#63:1> I certainly didn't expect that it would have happened already; I

expect it to take quite a bit of time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#64:1> Nevertheless, it 's tough being aware of this cultural divide,

particularly between me and <@> Dirk</@>.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#65:1> <@> Jake Wagner</@> ( J.W.), who directs the day camp, is easier for

me to relate to, I think because al-though he is black he is also from the

East rather than the South, and, as he himself says, there are ways he has

been " whitewashed."
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#66:1> <@> Ling</@>and I have had no problems at all getting along, which

has been a real blessing - - and I thank God so much for making us

room-mates--but I think at least part of that is that she goes to a small

liberal-arts college and thus we have that in common.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#67:1> Further reasons for thanksgiving: First of all, thank you all so much

for your letters.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#68:1> I've b 've getting mail almost every day--it 's been great! Many of the

kids do seem motivated to learn and to grow, so if we can just eliminate the

disruptions, I think they'l 'llave a really fun and productive summer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#69:1> Also, I am very hopeful that we'l 'lle able to make a significant

difference in a lot of the kids' lives, particularly those whose parents or

relatives have been involved in helping discipline them ( such as Matthew).
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#70:1> We interns have been meeting twice a week to discuss issues in

Christian community development, such as racial reconciliation and the nature

of Christian community, and those discussions have been challenging and

exciting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#71:1> Finally, my two outside friends, Jim Stipe ( who comes and volunteers

with my class Wednesdays) and <@> Soyoun Min</@>, have been a welcome refuge

when I'v 'veeeded to escape.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#72:1> <@> Jake</@> has also loaned me a guitar to use with the kids'

singing in the mornings ( he brings his bass guitar and plays on Wednesdays),

and so I'v 'veeen able to play a lot, both with the kids and for sanity 's

sake.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#73:1> I' 'mtemporarily without my tape player, so I' 'mlearning to get along

without it ( which is good) and enjoying being able to accompany myself to

make music.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#74:1> I could write lots more, but I think it 's about time to stop.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#75:1> I am definitely growing, and being stretched and purified by fire

here!
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#76:1> Philippians 1 has been very meaningful to me lately.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#77:1> I know your prayers are lifting me up, and I 'm very grateful for all

of that.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#78:1> I 'm praying for all of you folks as well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-001#79:1> " Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present

you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy--to the

only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus

Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen." ( Jude 24) </p>
