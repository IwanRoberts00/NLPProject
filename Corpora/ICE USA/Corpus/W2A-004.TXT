<ICE-USA:W2A-004#1:1> <h> Synderesis, the Spark of Conscience, in the English

Renaissance</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#2:1> It is a remarkable fact that Jerome 's single citation in his

commentary in the year 415 on Ezekiel 's inaugural vision led to a medieval

transformation and redefinition of the European idea of conscience that would

endure until the late seventeenth century.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#3:1> Although it has been argued that his reference to <it> synteresis

</it> ( later transliterated into Latin and English as synderesis or

synteresis) was simply a scribal error, it is also possible that he

appropriated the word from a now lost source when he added a fourth element

to Plato 's tripartite soul in his interpretation of Ezekiel 's description of

the throne of God.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#4:1> Whatever the origin of the word, however, the concept expressed by it

appears to have filled a logical need, which probably accounts for its

thorough development and elaboration during the Middle Ages by a series of

commentators from Peter Lombard to Jean Gerson.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#5:1> Their treatment of synderesis over three centuries established its

general definition, posed a set of attendant logical and psychological

problems, invented a supplemental terminology, and expanded its rhetorical

meaning hrough biblical exegesis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#6:1> Synderesis played an essential role in the scholastic analysis of

man 's conscience, of his thinking about moral matters, and of his

psychological response to conflicting impulses.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#7:1> Stoic and Patristic in its ancient origins and subsequently hedged

about with safeguarding qualifications against its Pelagian implications,

this paradoxical assertion of man 's spark of deiformity was an elaboration,

within the systematic abstractions of scholastic logic, of the revealed truth

that man was made in the image and likeness of God ( Genesis 1:27).
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#8:1> Accordingly, despite his invariably sinful conduct, he knew better and

was without excuse ( Romans 2:15).
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#9:1> The idea of synderesis was the expression, in terms of scholastic

psychology, of man 's postlapsarian recognition of the natural law through

right reason.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#10:1> At the heart of the theory of synderesis lay an emphatic, if

qualified, endorsement of the light of nature and a consequent assertion of

the dignity of man.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#11:1> The strength of this medieval tradition of thought about

synderesis was such that it reappeared inevitably in discussions of

conscience through the Renaissance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#12:1> It slowly became clear, however, that the rational affirmations and

implications of the concept were the Calvinist, skeptical, and fideist

beliefs of the sixteenth century, and with the protoscientific, secular, and

empiricist intellectual world coming to birth in the following age.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#13:1> As a result the term <quote> " synderesis</quote> suffered a gradual

eclipse, retaining what life it had only with the decadent scholasticism of

the universities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#14:1> It was then that the medieval association of synderesis with two

synonymous terms, <quote> spark</quote> and <quote> " natural

instinct,</quote> and with two descriptive biblical expressions, <quote>

the spirit of man</quote> and <quote> the candle of the Lord,"</quote>2

allowed a metamorphosis to take place.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#15:1> Thus an ancient idea that had initially received its definition as a

technical term of scholastic anthropology survived in new guises and

continued to play a role in late Renaissance thought until the time of Locke

and Butler.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#16:1> The history of synderesis forms part of the background for

seventeenth-century speculation about innate ideas and man 's moral sense.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#17:1> In two brief sentences in a passage that became a touchstone for

later commentators Jerome analyzed the meaning of the man, a lion, an ox, and

an eagle, that appear on each of the four creatures who support the throne of

God in Ezekiel 's vision:</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#18:1> Most people interpret the man, the lion and the ox as the appetitive

parts of the soul, following Plato 's division, who calls them the <it>

<foreign> logikon</foreign></it> and <it> <foreign> thymikon </foreign> </it>

and <it> <foreign> epithymetikon</foreign></it> , locating reason in the

brain, emotion in the gall bladder, and appetite in the liver.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#19:1> And they posit a fourth part which is above and beyond these three,

and which the Greeks call <it> <foreign> synteresin </foreign> </it> : that

spark of conscience which was not even extinguished in the breast of Cain

after he was turned out of Paradise, and by which we discern that we sin,

when we are overcome by pleasures or frenzy, and meanwhile are misled by an

imitation of reason.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#20:1> They reckon that this is, strictly speaking, the eagle, which is not

mixed up with the other three, but corrects them when they go wrong, and of

which we read in Scripture as the spirit which <quote> maketh intercession

for us with groanings which cannot be uttered</quote> ( Romans 8:26) <quote>

For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which is in

him?</quote> ( I Corinthians 2:11)...
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#21:1> However, we also see that this conscience is cast down in some

people, who have neither shame nor insight regarding their offenses, and

loses its place.3</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#22:1> Since no source has been found for Jerome 's vague reference to a

<quote> Greek</quote> ( Byzantine?) original for his use of the word in

this specific sense, his account remains the initial definition of <quote>

synderesis</quote> to mean con science or a pan or an aspect of conscience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#23:1> The word is derived from the Greek verb <it> <foreign>

tereo</foreign> </it> ( to watch over or preserve) and accordingly means

preservation or the power that preserves.4
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#24:1> In identifying synderesis as a fourth, independent, and

superintendent part of the soul, in placing it in apposition with the

metaphoric <quote> spark of conscience</quote> ( <it> <foreign> scintilla

conscientiae </foreign> </it> ) , in citing the story of Cain to exemplify

its inextinguishability, and in explicating it by referring to the biblical

<quote> spirit of man,</quote> as he proceeds to do, Jerome established a

frame of discourse that dominated subsequent discussion.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#25:1> Jerome 's reference to synderesis might have remained a forgotten

observation if two citations of it had not propelled it into the mainstream

of medieval thought.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#26:1> Although he did not quote the word <quote> synteresis,</quote>

Peter Lombard made reference to Jerome 's passage in his <it> Sentences </it>

( 1152), which became the standard theological textbook of the period.5
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#27:1> The context is a discussion of how the will can choose to follow an

evil course of action while continuing to experience a simultaneous

attraction to the good.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#28:1> In the numerous commentaries on the <it> Sentences </it> and in later

discussions of the powers of the soul, a philosophic definition of the

concept of synderesis evolved until both its existence and central importance

become familiar assumptions in the philosophy of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#29:1> Synderesis was eventually understood to be an innate inclination

or habit of the first principles of the practical reason about good and evil.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#30:1> It was the source of infallible natural intuitions of the basic

moral; of the natural law, principles recognized and embraced immediately,

once their terms were understood.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#31:1> It exercised an inextinguishable authority in correcting the mistaken

inclinations and judgments of the irascible, concupiscible, and rational

powers of the soul.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#32:1> This <quote> light of nature</quote> and <it> <foreign> dictamen

rationis </foreign> </it> was linked with the <it> <foreign> ratio sublimior

</foreign> </it> of St. Augustine and was the source of the principles upon

which conscience acted or failed to act; taken together with conscience, as

John of Damascus pointed out, it had the force of <quote> the law of our

mind</quote> in murmuring against inclining man to the good.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#33:1> Yet it was merely a relic or remnant of that original moral integrity

that had been lost by mankind in the fall.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#34:1> Its paradoxical mixture of strength and weakness was well expressed

in the metaphor of the spark, which suggested both the purity of essential

light and heat in the midst of dead ashes and the fragility of weakness and

threatened extinction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#35:1> It was a vestige of man 's original rectitude and as such an ironic

and pathetic reminder of the image of God in which man had been created.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#36:1> Jeremiah ( 31:33) and Paul ( Romans 2:15) were understood by medieval

exegetes to be describing synderesis when they spoke of <quote> the law

written in the heart</quote> which rendered man inexcusable.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#37:1> Certain examples of the universal moral principles of the natural

law recognized by synderesis were usually presented in discussions of its

nature; these included: <quote> do good and avoid evil"; <quote> God is to

be worshipped"</quote>; and <quote> do not do to others what you do not want

done to you.</quote> Principles such as these, it came to be argued, served

as the major premises of the syllogisms which logically underlay all human

moral actions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#38:1> These premises, recognized by synderesis in a non-deliberative

intuition, always remained necessary, inviolate, and unchangeable, while the

<}> <-> judgements </-> <+> judgments</+></}> of discursive reason and

conscience in the minor premise were and could be mistaken; they introduced

the possibility of error into the process of moral reasoning.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#39:1> A second citation was of equal or perhaps greater importance in

bringing the term <quote> synderesis</quote> into general use.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#40:1> Jerome 's entire comment was incorporated in the <it> Ordinary Gloss

</it> ( 1150) as part of its marginal explication of this notoriously

perplexing book and passage of the Bible.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#41:1> The authority and influence of the <it> Gloss </it> is well

illustrated by the fact that those who commented on the <it> Sentences </it>

invariably mined the <it> Gloss 's </it> quotation of Jerome for arguments in

their discussions of synderesis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#42:1> In fact, when we examine the widening circles of meaning that

surround <quote> synderesis,</quote> it is readily apparent that, almost

without exception, their center remains Jerome 's few sentences.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#43:1> The ambiguity arising from his apposition of the unfamiliar word "

synderesis</quote> with the phrase <quote> that spark of

conscience</quote> led to one of two conclusions: that synderesis was simply

another name, albeit a Greek technical name, for conscience, or that

synderesis was a distinct and specific part or aspect of conscience, called

<quote> the spark.</quote> The first view led to the indiscriminate use of

<quote> synderesis</quote> for conscience by those who confused the Greek

<it> synteresis </it> with the similar word for conscience <it> syneidesis

</it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#44:1> The second view resulted in an independent semantic identity and

history for the term <it> scintilla </it> or " spark.</quote> Jerome adds a

fourth term to this confusion when, following the lead of Origen and Gregory

Nazianzus, he puts both <quote> synderesis</quote> and <quote> that spark

of conscience</quote> in further apposition with the biblical expression

<quote> the spirit of man.</quote> The uncertainties rooted in these

ambiguous appositions flowered in the expanding definitions and varied use of

<quote> synderesis</quote> well into the seventeenth century; these

contrast with the aura of technical precision that has attended this term

from its rebirth in Christian speculation in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#45:1> Given these uncertainties, it is appropriate and prophetic that

Peter Lombard, in the first notable quotation of Jerome 's passage, ignored

<it> synteresis </it> altogether and substituted <it> superior </it> . . .<it><foreign>

scintilla rationis </foreign> </it> for Jerome 's <it> <foreign> scintilla

conscientiae </foreign> </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#46:1> Despite the new term, there is little doubt that Peter meant to refer

to conscience, and that he was understood to do so.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#47:1> His use of the expression <it> <foreign> scintilla rationis

</foreign> </it> , however, behind which almost certainly lay the influence

of Augustine 's identification, in <it> The City of God </it> , of the <it>

scintilla ration </it> is with the image of God in man, behind which lay an

earlier Greek tradition exemplified by Tatian 's reference to the soul <quote>

" retaining, as it were, a spark of its power</quote> certainly promoted the

substitution of <it> scintilla </it> , as a kind of shorthand, for <quote>

synderesis.</quote> There is also no doubt that <it> scintilla </it>

continued to carry with it overtones of meaning derived from its association

in Jerome 's passage with con science and the spirit of man.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#48:1> During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries <it> scintilla </it>

began to take on a life of its own as the most striking and prevalent

metaphor among the alternative descriptive terms for synderesis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#49:1> It was pressed into service by those who wrote in the mystical

tradition.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#50:1> Bonaventure, for example, summarizes the six degrees or powers of the

soul, rising from the external to the internal, from the temporal to the

eternal, as <quote> senses, imagination, reason, understanding, intelligence

and, at the tip of the mind, the spark of moral discernment</quote> ( <it>

<foreign> et, apex mentis, seu, synderesis scintilla </foreign> </it> ) .7

The idea of <quote> the spark</quote> or <it> vunkelin </it> was central to

Meister Eckhart 's explanation of his mystical experiences and teachings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#51:1> The expression of his views in metaphorical language may have

resulted in their condemnation as heretical by Pope John XXII in 1329, but

his religious and philosophic ideas were in fact traditional and orthodox.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#52:1> For example, although he is the first to employ a vernacular

equivalent for <it> scintilla </it> , the most recent study of Eckhart 's

thought maintains that he identified the <it> <foreign> vunkelin </foreign>

</it> with the <it> ratio superior </it> and <quote> introduced into

medieval psychology no really new factor regarding human cognitive

capabilities."8</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-004#53:1> By the time of Jean Gerson at the end of the fourteenth century

synderesis is afloat on a sea of metaphors and explanatory circumlocutions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#54:1> In the definition of terms for the function and powers of the soul in

<it> Gerson 's De Theologia Mystica, synderesis </it> is followed by an

acknowledgment that it is known by a variety of other names.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#55:1> Gerson understands synderesis to be the highest of the affective

powers, corresponding to and interacting with <it> the simplex intelligentia

</it> ( pure intelligence) of the cognitive powers;9 and he defines it as

<quote> an appetitive power of the soul which receives a certain natural

inclination to good immediately from God, through which it is led to follow a

good motion presented to it from the apprehension of pure

intelligence.</quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#56:1> He then conscientiously adds: <quote> We refer to synderesis,

however, by other names: either a practical habit of principles, or the spark

of intelligence ...
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#57:1> or a virginal part of the soul, or a natural stimulus to good, or the

apex of the mind, or an imperishable instinct, or such other names as the

first heaven among the affective powers."10
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#58:1> To this list might be added: <it> <foreign> recta ratio, superior

pars rationis, vertex animae, scintilla intelligentiae </foreign> </it> , and

the <it> <foreign> modicum lumen </foreign> </it> leading to God.11
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#59:1> The resemblance between what was meant by synderesis and what the

Stoics called <it> nous </it> and to <it> <foreign>

hegemonikon</foreign></it> 12 was recognized at an early stage and repeated

into the Renaissance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-004#60:1> It was also obvious that synderesis was the discoverer and preserver

of the <it> <foreign> koinai ennoiai </foreign> </it> ( common notions),

those <it> prolepseis </it> or anticipations of Greek thought.13</p> </I>
