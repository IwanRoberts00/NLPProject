<ICE-USA:W1B-027#1:1> <h> ITEM 1. BUSINESS</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#2:1> <h> GENERAL</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-027#3:1> Pfizer Inc. ( the " Company") is a diversified, research-based

health care company with global operations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#4:1> The Company discovers, develops, manufactures and sells

technology-intensive products in four business segments: Health Care, which

includes a broad range of prescription pharmaceuticals, orthopedic implants,

medical devices and surgical equipment; Animal Health, which includes animal

health products and feed supplements; Consumer Health Care, which includes a

variety of nonprescription drugs and personal care products; and Food

Science, which includes ingredients for the food and beverage industries.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#5:1> Additionally, the Company 's Financial Subsidiaries include a banking

operation in Europe and a small captive insurance operation.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#6:1> <h> COMPARATIVE SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA</h>

<p> Comparative segment and geographic data for the three years ended

December 31, 1994 are set forth on pages 35 and 36, and in the Note "

Financial Subsidiaries" on page 42 of the Company 's Annual Report to

Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994 and are incorporated

herein by reference.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#7:1> <h> HEALTH CARE</h>

<p> The Company 's Health Care business is comprised of pharmaceuticals and

hospital products.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#8:1> The Company competes with numerous other health care companies in the

discovery and development of new, technologically advanced pharmaceutical and

hospital products; in seeking use of its products by the medical profession;

and in the sale of its product lines to wholesale and retail outlets, public

and private hospitals, managed care organizations, government and the medical

profession.</p>

<p> Methods of competition in health care vary with the product category.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#9:1> There are a significant number of innovative companies in the field.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#10:1> A critical factor in most markets in which the Company competes is

the ability to offer technological advances over competitive products.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#11:1> The productivity of scientific discovery and clinical development

efforts is central to long-term operational success since there are many

companies that specialize in marketing products that no longer have patent or

regulatory protection.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#12:1> Other important factors in these markets include the ability to

transfer knowledge of technological advances to the medical community,

product quality, prompt delivery and price.</p>

<p> The United States pharmaceutical marketplace has in recent years

experienced intensified price competition, brought about by a range of market

forces, including: new product development, increased generic competition,

growth of managed care organizations and legislation requiring pharmaceutical

companies to provide rebates and discounts to government purchasers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#13:1> Similar competitive forces, in varying degrees, have also been

present in various other countries in which the Company operates.</p>

<p> Prescription pharmaceutical and hospital products, both in the United

States and abroad, are promoted directly to physicians, as well as to a

variety of managed care organizations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#14:1> Pharmaceutical products are distributed in large part to wholesale

and retail outlets, hospitals, clinics and managed care organizations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#15:1> Hospital products are generally sold directly to medical institutions

and, in some cases, through distributors and surgical supply dealers.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#16:1> <h> PHARMACEUTICALS</h>

<p> The Company 's worldwide pharmaceutical products are comprised primarily

of drugs which fall into the following major therapeutic classes:

cardiovascular agents, anti-infectives, central nervous system agents,

anti-inflammatories and anti-diabetes agents.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#17:1> In 1994, pharmaceuticals made up 70&percent; of the Company 's consolidated

net sales, an increase from 69&percent; in 1993 and 63&percent; in 1992.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#18:1> Increases in both United States and international pharmaceutical

revenues in 1994 were principally the result of strong sales of products

launched in the 1990s, including Norvasc ( amlodipine besylate), Cardura (

doxazosin mesylate), Diflucan ( fluconazole), Zithromax ( azithromycin) and

Zoloft ( sertraline).</p>

<p> Cardiovascular products are the Company 's largest therapeutic product

line accounting for 29&percent; of the Company 's consolidated 1994 net sales, an

increase from 27&percent; in 1993 and 23&percent; in 1992.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#19:1> These products realized sales growth of 20&percent; in 1994, including an 85&percent;

increase in sales of Norvasc, an intrinsically once-a-day calcium channel

blocker for hypertension and angina, as well as a 27&percent; increase in sales of

Cardura, an alpha blocker for hypertension.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#20:1> A supplemental New Drug Application for the use of Cardura in the

treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( " BPH") was approved by the

United States Food and Drug Administration ( " FDA") in February 1995.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#21:1> Sales of Procardia XL ( nifedipine GITS), a once-a-day calcium

channel blocker for hypertension and angina, increased by less than 1&percent; in

1994.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#22:1> The Company 's U.S.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#23:1> cardiovascular sales grew 12&percent; and international sales of

cardiovascular agents rose 38&percent; in 1994.</p>

<p> Worldwide anti-infective sales increased 7&percent; in 1994 on the strength of

Diflucan and Zithromax.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#24:1> U.S. anti-infective sales grew 14&percent; while international sales rose by

3&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#25:1> Diflucan, an antifungal agent, is indicated for use in a variety of

fungal infections including certain types which afflict AIDS and

immunosuppressed cancer patients.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#26:1> The product also received U.S. approval for the indication of vaginal

candidiasis in 1994.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#27:1> Diflucan posted a sales increase of 14&percent; in 1994 and Zithromax, an

oral antibiotic, posted a sales increase of 43&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#28:1> Total anti-infective sales accounted for 21&percent; of the Company 's

consolidated 1994 net sales, compared to 22&percent; in 1993 and 20&percent; in 1992.</p>

<p> Sales of Pfizer 's central nervous system agents rose 46&percent; in 1994,

reflecting increased sales of Zoloft, an anti-depressant introduced in the

U.S. in 1992.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#29:1> Central nervous system agents grew to 13&percent; of 1994 net pharmaceutical

sales and 9&percent; of the Company 's consolidated 1994 net sales.</p>

<p> The Company 's anti-inflammatory agents, including Feldene ( piroxicam),

accounted for less than 10&percent; of the Company 's consolidated 1994 net sales.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#30:1> The Company 's anti-diabetes agents, including Glucotrol ( glipizide)

and Glucotrol XL ( glipizide GITS), a sustained release anti-diabetic

approved in the U.S. in 1994, accounted for less than 10&percent; of the Company 's

consolidated 1994 net sales.

sought for both the osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis indications, regulatory

approvals for Enablex capsules for rheumatoid arthritis have been applied for

in 29 countries and have been obtained in two countries.
<ICE-USA:W1B-027#40:1> No launches of Enablex have yet taken place.</p>
