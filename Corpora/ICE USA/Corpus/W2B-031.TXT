<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#3:1> In our rush to build the Web, we've fallen into some really

limiting hab 've when it comes to both our visual designs and our technology

presentations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#4:1> When I first started in Web design, I grabbed at everything that

came down the assembly line: graphics, animation, Flash.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#5:1> If I didn't use something, I read about it and tried out the code, the

software, or the technique.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#6:1> I experimented, and I loved it all.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#7:1> In my frenzy, I made some offensive mistakes, and I still make them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#8:1> But I'm learning a lot, and one thing I'm noticing is that 'my bad

habits have sometimes g 'mten in the way of designing aesthetically great

sites that embrace today 's recommended markup and related practices.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#9:1> It 's like being a self-taught guitar player.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#10:1> I'm innovative but encumbered. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA: 'mB-031#11:1> In our rush to build the Web, we've fallen into some really

limiting h 'vets when it comes to both our visual designs and our technology

presentations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#12:1> The more I study markupespecially in the context of XMLthe more I'm

convinced that the solution to our design wo 'm lies in the essence of markup,

and not in the fun frills. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#13:1> In my early days as a Web designer, I had friends who'd been in

the compute 'dindustry for years, had been using the Internet for email,

Telnet, FTP, and Usenet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#14:1> They hated graphics, even hated the idea of GUI access to the Web.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#15:1> They made fun of me for anticipating the possibility of a visual Web,

much less a media-rich Web. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#16:1> It 's odd for meespecially with my love of broadband and clever

Flash designto come around to a purist point of view when it comes to visual

Web design.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#17:1> Perhaps I'm not as radical as the friends who once teased 'me, and I

don't regret my experimental frenzy one bit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#18:1> But now it 's time for all of us to pay attention to what we're doing,

why we're d 'reg it, and for who 're
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#19:1> We're challenged to grow in 'rethe new wireless and alternative design

options. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#20:1> To formulate a successful contemporary design, we must first

study visual design mistakes, examine the alternatives, and find solutions in

markup.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#21:1> When we integrate visual design concepts and today 's recommended

markup options, we make a surprising find:
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#22:1> A Web site can be aesthetically appropriate and completely

cross-browser, cross-platform compliant. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#23:1> <h> Where We Went Astray</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#24:1> We tried to make the Web multimedia, but it isn't.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#25:1> Multimedia means multiple media forms operating in an integrated

environment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#26:1> However, the Web was never meant to be a platform for simultaneous

delivery of multiple media forms.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#27:1> It was originally created for text.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#28:1> It can deliver multimedia, but the Web is at root a text environment

with links as an added component.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#29:1> The ability to link from one document to many other supportive or

referential documents meant that we could break free of the more linear

constructs that defined books.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#30:1> When the Web became a graphical environment, it was no longer just

text that was linked.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#31:1> Rather, graphics or other media became the objects of this

hyper-environment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#32:1> And so emerged hypermedia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#33:1> This extension beyond the linear structure is what makes it " hyper,"

or more than what we had previously experienced.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#34:1> Hypermedia is what makes the Web especially intriguing. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#35:1> <h> Hypermedia Versus Multimedia</h>

<p> There are very important differences between multimedia and hypermedia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#36:1> Multimedia is dimensional, and while it 's almost always interactive,

that interactivity is restricted by context.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#37:1> Hypermedia can also be described as dimensional, but in a less

literal sense.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#38:1> Hypermedia adds dimension to a two-dimensional space by attracting a

critical mass of people who keep it vibrant and constantly alive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#39:1> This " dimension" has yet to be defined, but its impact is obvious.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#40:1> Context is less critical for hypermedia than for multimedia, and

hypermedia is more organicit 's defined by interactivity, while multimedia

more closely resembles a presentation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#41:1> Consider more traditional delivery methods for multimedia, such

as CD-ROM presentations or kiosks with touch screens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#42:1> Access is pretty much limited to one personat most a fewat any

given time.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#43:1> The Web can be extremely human in a way that these devices cannot.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#44:1> The fact that we're present in interac 'rens with one another on such

a massive scale changes the scope of visual communicationor all

communicationgreatly. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#45:1> However, the limitations and ungainliness of multimedia somehow

found their way into the visual design of the Web, and it 's not a good fit.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#46:1> Because the Web emerged from a text environment, it 's unlikely

that most people thought " TV" when they first saw pages in Mosaic.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#47:1> As far as I recall, a graphic looked ungainly against a mid-gray

background.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#48:1> Everything was clunky, too big, too slow, or too heavy. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#49:1> We began creating dimensional objects for Web sites when 15-inch

monitors were all the rage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#50:1> Consider what a mistake it was to try to create dimension on a screen

that small.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#51:1> We did it anyway, and we set a very poor precedent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#52:1> ( After all, now that portable devices are all the rage, screens are

only getting smaller.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#53:1> Today 's average monitor has a 17-inch screen, only slightly

bigger than a breadbox.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#54:1> Bear in mind that I'm purposely not talking about resolu 'mon here,

I'm talking about physical size, mass. 'm<ICE-USA:W2B-031#55:1> It 's ridiculous to try to stuff so much onto a page.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#56:1> Whether it 's text, graphics, mediaI don't care.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#57:1> We don't need so many bells and whistles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#58:1> Simplicity is almost always beautiful, and even at its worst it 's not

offensive. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#59:1> So why do we continue to stuff our pages until the seams strain?

It all started when we recognized the Web as a possible platform for

multimedia, and then decided that multimedia was the best way to use the Web.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#60:1> Sadly, this marginalized hypermedia, as evident in the vast

proliferation of debris left over from early days of designoverblown

graphics, dancing GIFs, and pages that come complete with soundtracks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#61:1> We tried to make the Web multimedia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#62:1> And frighteningly enough, we're still doing 're
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#63:1> It 's wrong, and it 's limiting. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#64:1> Let 's examine what we're doing wit 'reesign.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#65:1> Isn't it possible that we compromised our ability to explore a

uniquely fresh hypermedia environment by imposing an existing notion of

multimedia instead? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#66:1> Why do we want to create objects and place visual ideas in a Web

environment that is so obviously visually flat? I think we're striving 're

something that 's tactile.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#67:1> We've tried to make 've Web something we could happily touch instead

of embracing its more abstract qualities: a nonlinear approach to the flow of

thought and information, and an interactive dimension thatwhile not

tactilepromises rich experiences for the user. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#68:1> <h> Boxed In</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#69:1> Unfortunately, our problems don't stop with multimedia clutter.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#70:1> Once we've swept away the 'vecess, we'll have t 'lleal with the rigid,

angular pages left behind. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#71:1> Rectangles are completely limiting.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#72:1> We've allowed ourse 'ves to be bound by the de facto system of a Web

page 's infrastructure, particularly in terms of content and shape.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#73:1> We're taking 'ree physical mass of a 17-inch monitor and essentially

pasting more rectangles inside its rectangular frame.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#74:1> Borders within borders of content with more borders. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#75:1> What 's even more interesting is examining the markup we've been

us 've to achieve our layouts, namely tables and sometimes frames.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#76:1> Again, we're worki 'reon very rigid, rectangular models.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#77:1> The same is true for those few angels who've found a w 'veto make CSS

positioning work for them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#78:1> A box-model still rules the day. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#79:1> Why do we try to box everything in? Global human expression is

filled with curved shapes and structurescircles, spirals, and spheres.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#80:1> Yet those of us in the Western world favor lines, angles, and

rectangles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#81:1> We've revered a 'verespected the linear for so long that the phrase "

thinking outside the box" has become synonymous with revolutionary

innovation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#82:1> Look at a wall in your home.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#83:1> If you have a nice painting or poster, it 's probably in a rectangular

frame.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#84:1> Windows are rectangles; doors are rectangles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#85:1> This shape makes up a lot of our world.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#86:1> And that 's fine, but we have sky out there too.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#87:1> A screen has no sky.

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#88:1> What it does have is more rectangles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#89:1> You have a frame around the monitor, your browser frames your

content, and some people put borders and frames into the visual design of

their pages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#90:1> For those of you who eschew borders and frames, you're sti 'rebuilding

on a grid system, which frames the infrastructure.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#91:1> So how do we open things up, give our screens a little bit of sky?

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#92:1> It 's a fascinating problem.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#93:1> While CSS2 offers all kinds of powerful border, spacing, and padding

options, we've had a 'velution in CSS1 all along: the use of color and type to

achieve shape within the inherent design.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#94:1> If you put all of that into a style sheet, and leave only your

content in your markup document, the content will still be accessible by any

other platform and device. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#95:1> <h> Design the Future Today</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#96:1> Several principles will help designers shift away from the

legacies of our early mistakes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#97:1> Let 's move into an integrated methodology of client-side development

that marries markup and visual aesthetics. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#98:1> <h> Flatten Your Design.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#99:1> If old belief systems suggest mimicking the tactile world, but

adding dimension isn't working, then let go.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#100:1> Get flat. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#101:1> The Web, at least onscreen, is still a two-dimensional space.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#102:1> This is mechanically true because graphics are displayed in two

dimensions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#103:1> From a technical perspective, you can tap into extremely clean HTML

or XHTML combined with CSS.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#104:1> Your site is then readable on every browser, platform, and

appliance. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#105:1> You've sepa 'veed your formatting and presentation effectively,

and you've flat 'veed everything.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#106:1> You have no bevels, no buttons, no shadows, no light sources.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#107:1> You have no tabs, no drop-down menus.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#108:1> You do have color, and you do have content.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#109:1> I'll 'lll you what to do with that in a minute. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#110:1> <h> Stop Being Square. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#111:1> It 's nearly impossible to break out of the rectangular systems

for visual Web design.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#112:1> But contemporary design should open up confined space or create new

ways of looking at old space. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#113:1> Wherever you can, avoid creating lots of rectangles unless you

have a specific reason for using them ( such as for expressing containment

and security).
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#114:1> Focus instead on the parts of shapes: lines, curves, and angles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#115:1> If you do use rectangles, leave them flat against the

backgrounddon't add bevels or drop shadows, or any dimension at all. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#116:1> Ironically, this reduces file size, too.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#117:1> The more effects there are in a graphic, the harder it becomes to

compress. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#118:1> <h> Use Very Few Graphics. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#119:1> I'm con 'mnced that the best designs use only graphics that are

absolutely necessary.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#120:1> If you limit your use of graphics, the ones you do use will grab

much more attention, especially if they're 'rell planned and well placed. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#121:1> Use text for links, rely on CSS for effects like removing

underlines or creating rollovers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#122:1> Rely on color for fonts, headers, and all link options.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#123:1> Again, use CSS wherever possible to separate the presentation from

the markup, keeping the markup itself very clean. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#124:1> <h> Keep Scripting and Multimedia to a Minimum. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#125:1> Hate me if you want to, but in most cases, scripting, Flash,

Shockwave, and QuickTime elements aren't necessary.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#126:1> Sure, if you're 'reilding the next big alternative rock band 's Web

site, go get happy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#127:1> And independent Flash artistsyou keep doing what you'r 'reoing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#128:1> But when it comes to most commercial site design situations, rely on

clever CSS color schemes and keep your markup as uncluttered as possible.

</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#129:1> <h> Flatten, Simplify, and Separate.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#130:1> Contemporary visual design should strive to be flat.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#131:1> It should denounce old belief systems about what kind of medium the

Web really is and just visually embrace its simple dimension. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#132:1> Flat design is not only an aesthetic or reactionary choice; it 's

also a choice that integrates perfectly with Web markup methodologies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#133:1> This means successfully separating content and presentation, which

positions your site for the Web, for wireless, for backward-compatible

browsers, for anything. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-031#134:1> Today 's Web sites remain frighteningly poor in terms of visual

design and markup practices.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#135:1> I 'm convinced that in their current state, Web standards and visual

trends are perfectly matched to offer the best visual design and the

cleanest, most platform-versatile offerings around.
<ICE-USA:W2B-031#136:1> Learning to balance these issues is the best gift we can give to our

audiences, and ourselves. </p>
