<ICE-USA:W1A-011#2:1> <@> Dan Brown</@>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#3:1> <h> 1. Select a phoneme in English and discuss how the place of

articulation explains the pronunciation or the phoneme. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#4:1> The phoneme [ s] in English is made by placing the tip of the

tongue against the alveolar ridge just behind the upper teeth and forcing air

through a narrow opening between the tongue and the alveolar ridge.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#5:1> This makes it a class that English uses part of a class of sounds

called fricatives frequently.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#6:1> Fricatives are all made through some means of forcing air through an

opening to make a sort of buzzing or hissing sound.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#7:1> This includes sounds such as [ f], [ v], and [ z], as well as [ s).
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#8:1> The [ s] sound is distinguished not only through its place of

articulation, which is the same as [ z], but also by virtue of being unvoiced

( the vocal chords do not vibrate when It is sounded).</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#9:1> <h> 2. What 's the difference between the English alphabet and the

phonetic alphabet?
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#10:1> Explain.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#11:1> The difference between these two alphabets is the bane of writing

students everywhere - - native and non-native speakers of English alike.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#12:1> English, although it has a wide range of phonemes, simply does not

have a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds It uses and the letters

it uses to form words.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#13:1> The phonetic alphabet, on the other hand, has this basic

correspondence: [ I] will forever be [ I], for example, whether it is in the

word cheat, beet, complete, or amigo.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#14:1> Although kindergarten teachers all across the country teach the

sounds of the English alphabet as if they were regular and definable, this is

a lesson that students generally have to unlearn later in life.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#15:1> Sometimes I think it would be better if we were to teach English as

an ideographic system, like the system of Chinese characters, because it

might help alleviate the sense of betrayal that students feel when they

discover that the letter " a" can have multitude of sounds - - or no sound at

all - - and the lessons that Mrs. McGillicuddy taught them when they were

five or six about the long and the short sound of " a", or the rule that "

when two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking", are frequently

violated in practice.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#16:1> It is hard to find a phonological rule in English orthography that

does not have exceptions, and this makes things difficult for both teachers

and students, I think it is time, given the current ascendancy of English as

a global lingua franca, to militate for spelling reform but that is probably

just a pipe dream, given the conservative nature or a codified language With

Such a large corpus of published work as Is available In English.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#17:1> However, even if English were to regularize Its spelling, there would

still be a need for the phonetic alphabet.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#18:1> This is because the phonetic alphabet is primarily useful

cross-linguistically, to talk about sounds that may have different

orthographic representations in different languages.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#19:1> For example, the letter " x" in the pinyin system, which was used to

alphabetize Chinese, is a very different sound from what the letter " x"

represents in Greek.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#20:1> I could give many more examples ( compare " r" in Spanish and French,

for instance), but the point is that the phonetic alphabet makes it possible

to compare the sounds of different languages without confusing competing

orthographies.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#21:1> <h> 3. Supply an English word containing two derivational affixes and

one inflectional affix.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#22:1> Explain why the two affixes are derivational and the one affix is

inflectional,</H>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#23:1> ( I am going to assume that its OK to talk about a word with more

than two derivational affixes, since I am having trouble coming up the exact

combination of derivational and inflectional affixes that you ask for here.)
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#24:1> Here 's a word that not only illustrates the process of derivational

and inflectional affixes, but also the process of how new words are created

through such affixation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#25:1> " Ungrammatical I ties" is made up of five morphemes, by my count,

analyzed as follows.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#26:1> The root or head word here would be " grammar", the study of the

form, structure, and sometimes meaning of language.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#27:1> This becomes " grammatical" by adding one of several suffixes that

are used in English to make a noun Into an adjective.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#28:1> I then add another suffix ( - ity"), to turn It back into a noun, but

with an altered meaning ( " grammar" is not the same as " grammaticality").
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#29:1> Going one step further, I put on the prefix " un-" to reverse the

meaning and turn " grammaticality" into its opposite.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#30:1> So far, all these affixations are derivational - - they alter the

lexical class of the word and/or change its meaning.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#31:1> To create a word with an inflectional morpheme, I pluralize "

ungrammaticality" to get " ungrammaticalities."
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#32:1> The " - s" ending ( which, in this case, also involves a spelling

change) is inflectional because it merely changes the function of the word

from singular to plural and does not alter its class ( it remains a noun) or

its basic meaning ( which remains as tortured as ever).
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#33:1> Now the fact that there is no such word in English as ..

ungrammaticalities" does not stop me from using it, nor does it change the

process of its formation, nor does it prevent you from understanding its

meaning 0 hope).
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#34:1> You could argue that the idea could be expressed in some more elegant

manner, but you would probably have to throw out ninety percent of the

obfuscation of academics as well, and then where would we be?</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#35:1> <h> 4. Supply one example each of a compound and a lexical borrowing

in English.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#36:1> Explain your choices.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#37:1> " Cakewalk" is a compound word with an amusing history, Composed

of two familiar words, it was originally the name for a kind of promenade in

which competitors vied to see who could perform the most complex steps, and

the winners were awarded ( you guessed it) a cake.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#38:1> It became codified as a compound when a popular dance and a

particular style of music came out of these competitions, It has since taken

on an additional meaning of " an easy time," probably through a folk

etymology that associated " cakewalk" with the phrase, " It was a piece of

cake."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#39:1> Lexical borrowing is rampant in English, but I'll 'llnfine myself

to two related words, " taco" and " burrito."
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#40:1> These were both borrowed from Spanish because English had no

corresponding words to talk about these staples of Latino cuisine.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#41:1> It would probably be hard to find a person in the States today who

did not recognize these words as being food items - - although you could

certainly find a fair number of monolingual Anglo-Americans who didn't know

the difference between the two, A purist might argue that these are not

English words, but once a word is understood and used frequently enough it

simply becomes part of the language.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#42:1> It 's only after enough time ( and usage) goes by, when the origin has

been generally forgotten, that such words are deemed acceptable by the

purists.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#43:1> ( I can't really explain these choices except to say that these

are the words that occurred to me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#44:1> Did you expect more than that?</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#45:1> <h> 5. Why is the yes/no question Did the class meet early? formed by

the insertion of the verb Did rather than by simple inversion of the subject

and verb ( as in Is the class meeting early?
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#46:1> Explain.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#47:1> One of the most befuddling things about English is this " Do"

insertion, because it is not a universal way of forming questions - - even

within English itself.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#48:1> " Met the class early?" has a vaguely archaic sound, and most people

would be hard-put to say why it was incorrect, although it is clearly

nonexistent in terms of current usage.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#49:1> Part of what 's confusing about this construction Is that the verb "

do" takes on any necessary inflectional form ( " did" In this example), while

the lexical verb ( " meet" in this case) reverts to its base form.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#50:1> I could say, " Is the class meeting early?" but this would change the

tense, and hence the meaning, implying that the class was still going on.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#51:1> Even If I change it to " Was the class meeting early?" the use of the

progressive form of the verb has different implications than the original

question.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#52:1> If I were to say " Was the class early?" I would be closest to the

original meaning, but even then there are different possibilities for each

utterance.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#53:1> The use of " did" Implies ( although it does not guarantee) that the

speaker Is talking about one particular Instance, " did" in this case carries

the form and meaning of the preterit.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#54:1> On the other hand, " Was the class early?" would usually imply (

although not always) that the speaker was talking about the regular meeting

time of an ongoing class that had now finished.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#55:1> However, because English does not make a clear distinction between

the Imperfect and preterit, the full meaning of these two questions would be

determined by the context,.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#56:1> The way I explain this to my students is by asking them to look for

the " main verb."
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#57:1> If this verb is a form of " to be" ( as in " The class was early."),

the question can be formed by simple Inversion.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#58:1> If the verb is anything else, " do" needs to be inserted, with the

choice of the form dependent on the form or the original verb.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#59:1> Thus, " The class met early." becomes " Did the class meet early?"
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#60:1> The explanation Is difficult to get into without using such

complicated terms as " lexical verb" or " bare infinitive," but I think It is

useful for some students, in order to conceptualize the process.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#61:1> For those who are hopelessly confused by such an explanation, one can

only resort to practice - - which is how we native speakers of English

learned this rule as children.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#62:1> <h> 6. Why is might considered an auxiliary verb and walk a lexical

verb?
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#63:1> Explain.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#64:1> " Walk" is considered a lexical verb because it has some kind of

referential meaning: it refers to an action which we distinguish from other

actions by certain characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#65:1> There are also abstract lexical verbs, such as " think," or

non-active verbs such as " lack," for which it would be harder to find a

clear referent, but every lexical verb has a meaning independent of its

grammatical context.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#66:1> An auxiliary verb, on the other hand, only has meaning when it is

combined with a lexical verb.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#67:1> While it is possible to say " I might," it would have to be paired

with another, Implied verb.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#68:1> Otherwise, the only appropriate response would be " You might what?"
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#69:1> The word " might" is used to express the idea of possibility, but it

is a grammatical idea that must be placed within the context of the sentence.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#70:1> An auxiliary verb such as " might" could be used with any other verb;

at the same time, it must be used with some other verb,.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#71:1> There are auxiliaries such as " have" that also can be lexical verbs,

but " might" does not have this possibility. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#72:1> <h> 7. Supply two words in English related by the relation of

hyponymy.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#73:1> Explain your choices. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#74:1> " Rice" and " wheat" are hyponyms because they are part of a

class of words we call " grains."
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#75:1> Hyponymy is the relationship between such groups of words, and as

such it is a relationship of meaning that usually is unconnected to the form

or origin of the words.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#76:1> " Rice" and " wheat" share the characteristics of being edible

grasses that have been cultivated for centuries.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#77:1> We use them for many of the same purposes, for making flour, cereal,

bread, etc.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#78:1> It is useful to conceptualize them as being related, and hyponymy is

simply a linguist 's way of conceptualizing this conceptualization. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#79:1> <h> 8. What semantic features distinguish the words hen and man.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#80:1> Explain your choice of the features you select to distinguish the

words.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#81:1> Hen = - human, +female, +mature, +animal, +bird,

+domesticated</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#82:1> Man = +human, +male, +mature</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#83:1> In presenting these semantic features, I have tried to put them

in an order f descending specificity, with the last feature being the most

particular, one of the most basic semantic distinctions we make Is between

human and non-human ( one could argue that this is also one of our most basic

problems as well, but I 'll leave that as a moot point for the

eco-philosophers).
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#84:1> Another key distinction, almost as important in our thinking, is

between male and female.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#85:1> Less important, but still basic to the conceptualization of the

world, is the distinction between maturity and immaturity in living things.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#86:1> It is Interesting that this Is as far as I could get with the word "

man."
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#87:1> This is because " man" is itself a basic concept, specific and

commonplace in one sense, broad and mystical in another.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#88:1> For " hen," I considered " +animal" to be a separate distinction from "

- human," because there are several large categories of nonhuman things.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#89:1> " +bird" distinguishes the kind of animal a " hen" is, as does "

+domesticated," although the two are different kinds of distinctions, still

broad enough to be considered semantic features.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#90:1> <h> 9. All of the languages of the world contain words that could be

analyzed as nouns and verbs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#91:1> Would this be an absolute universal, a universal tendency, or an

implicational universal?
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#92:1> Explain.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-011#93:1> The fact that all the languages of the world have nouns and verbs

is an absolute universal.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#94:1> An absolute universal, as its name implies, is a rule of language

that has no exceptions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#95:1> In a way, this is what makes the whole concept of language universals

possible.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#96:1> If there were no absolute universals, if there were no identifiable

features that cut across all languages, the theory that there is some kind of

cognitive process or facility governing our acquisition and use of language

would probably never have been formed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-011#97:1> Until some other form of communication is discovered that breaks the

mold of human language ( decoded dolphin songs? extraterrestrial

communications?), it will be through the study of language universals that we

learn about the structure of the cognitive process that makes language

possible in the first place. </p> </I>
