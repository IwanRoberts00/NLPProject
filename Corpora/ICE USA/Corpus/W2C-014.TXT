<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#1:1> SAN DIEGO - Increased competition for federal funds and a shift in

The priorities of corporate laboratories toward core businesses dictate that

scientists discard the notion of wholly separate academic and industrial

research activities in favor of more collaboration, according to Jean M.J.

Frechet, Cornell professor of chemistry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#2:1> Academic and industrial collaborations can benefit both sides

equally if management adopts an enlightened approach, said Frechet, who

received the American Chemical Society Cooperative Research Award March 14 at

the society 's national meeting.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#3:1> " Could a corporation remain healthy over a long period of time

without any long-term research?" he asked in a presentation.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#4:1> " Would the ivory tower crumble if a blend of fundamental and

mission-oriented research were carried out within its walls?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#5:1> A beneficiary of fruitful collaborations with IBM, Eastman Kodak

Coand Exxon Chemical Co., Frechet said the best collaborations are those that

" begin with a handshake between scientists and a true desire to collaborate"

rather than a legal framework.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#6:1> Nonetheless, he advocated that academic scientists establish a clear

understanding of the relationship that preserves the ability to publish

freely, guards intellectual property rights and sets both sides on equal

footing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#7:1> Since 1979, Frechet has collaborated with C. Grant Willson,

formerly of the IBM Almaden Research Center and now at the University of

Texas, in the development of novel photoresists for microelectronic devices.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#8:1> The two researchers and Hiroshi Ito of IBM Almaden Research Center

shared the ACS award for " breakthrough collaborative work" that today is

widely used in the production of dynamic random access memory products,

according to the ACS.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#9:1> The production of computer chips - which are the heart of every

personal computer - has relied on an acid-catalyzed process known as chemical

amplification.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#10:1> The researchers developed a similar base-catalyzed process that is

far less susceptible to environmental contamination.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#11:1> They have used the technique to produce chips with electrical-

Conducting lines spaced 0.5 microns ( millionths of a meter) apart, equal to

the highest-resolution commercial chips produced by other methods.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#12:1> Frechet collaborated with David Williams at Kodak to produce

novel polymers with nonlinear optical properties.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#13:1> These substances are useful for doubling the frequency of lasers,

which changes the color of the beam, or in amplifying power output.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#14:1> " We needed physicists, and they had just the right ones,"

Frechet said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#15:1> Many of Frechet 's students have spent weeks or months at Kodak

and IBM on this and other projects, broadly directed toward " smart polymers"

with useful industrial properties.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#16:1> In each case he has ensured that his students retained the right to

publish all material from the collaborations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#17:1> Without such a guarantee, his students would not have the ability

to publish their accomplishments in the scientific literature, which is

crucial for their career development, he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#18:1> " Our students have to be able to speak freely," he added.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#19:1> " We receive funding from our corporate collaborators, but it 's

unrestricted. We do what we want to do within a broad area of interest to

both parties.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#20:1> " I get collaborators who are top notch," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#21:1> " In turn, my industrial partners find that it 's exciting to talk to

bright students with new ideas, and they get insight into problems they might

not have time to pursue."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#22:1> Collaborations have produced patents held by the university, by

the industrial partner or by both parties.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#23:1> The outcome depends solely on who had the major role in discovery, he

explained.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#24:1> So-called pure and applied research are not useful terms, he

suggested. " We all pursue research to discover new things," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#25:1> " Sometimes the discoveries have fundamental value, sometimes

practical value, sometimes both.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#26:1> We design industrially useful molecules based on the development of

new fundamental principles.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#27:1> Our work blends the notions of pure and applied."</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-014#28:2> <h> Engineering college makes changes to involve, excite students

early</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#29:2> Engineering students who think they are required to take too many

Courses to get a Cornell degree, take note:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#30:2> Beginning with the incoming freshman class ( ' 98), the number of

hours required for an engineering degree will decrease, and students will

have a more flexible, comprehensive curriculum.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#31:2> " The faculty have made the first significant undergraduate

engineering curriculum changes since the current requirements were adopted

almost 15 years ago," said John E. Hopcroft, the Joseph Silbert Dean of the

College of Engineering.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#32:2> Engineering faculty approved the changes Feb. 28, after more than

three years of study.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#33:2> The College Curriculum Governing Board started to look at the

curriculum in 1991, as an ad-hoc committee examining the freshman-sophomore

engineering experience.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#34:2> It blossomed into a full-fledged committee examining teaching and

curriculum, and led to the new undergraduate requirements.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#35:2> <h> Among the changes </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#36:2> Among the changes: Students need fewer credits for an engineering

degree, 38 courses instead of 40; they will be able to affiliate with a field

within engineering earlier in their college experience; they have more

flexibility in taking courses outside of engineering; and they must take a

hands-on introduction-to-engineering course freshman year, exposing them to

the " excitement and process of engineering" early in their college

careers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#37:2> The changes are an example of the importance the college puts on

undergraduate education, and they reflect changes in engineering education

across the nation, Hopcroft says.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#38:2> " The old curriculum put tremendous burden on you your junior

year," the dean said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#39:2> " It 's extraordinarily demanding, because you're just dec 'reing your

major in the college and have to take a difficult load of courses."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#40:2> The new curriculum is less rigid in the later years and more

complete and integrated. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#41:2> <h> Current curriculum </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#42:2> For example, the current curriculum requires students to take a

heavy dose of basic courses, such as physics, math and computer science,

during their freshman and sophomore years.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#43:2> It is not until their junior year that they take field-specific

engineering classes, such as those in electrical, materials, civil,

mechanical and aerospace engineering or applied physics.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#44:2> One of the problems with that, the dean said, is that

historically students transfer out of the college before the junior year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#45:2> In fact, almost 90 percent of students entering the engineering

college between 1983 and 1989 graduated from Cornell, but only 75 percent or

so graduated from the engineering college.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#46:2> But the new curriculum requires an introductory course in a

field, hands-on learning lab, during freshman year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#47:2> That will expose them to engineering early in their college careers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#48:2> Then, the student must affiliate with a specific engineering field,

such as civil and environmental, or mechanical and aerospace, for example, in

the sophomore year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#49:2> By the end of their fourth semester, they will already have taken

three or more engineering courses, one or two of them in their specific

field.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#50:2> Additionally, " Industry demands that engineers have a more

well-rounded education," said Hopcroft, who took over as dean Jan. 1,

replacing William Streett, who has returned to teaching in the chemical

engineering department.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#51:2> " The new curriculum will give*them an opportunity to take more

courses outside their field."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#52:2> The curriculum also will make it easier for a student to study

abroad.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#53:2> The college has an engineering program in Hamburg, Germany, for 22

students and is considering starting one in Asia.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#54:2> Hopcroft also said he wants faculty to involve undergraduates in

their research projects.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#55:2> " We're committe 'reo getting students involved in the research

experience.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#56:2> This is a research university.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#57:2> Every faculty member in the college is involved in research and

teaching.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#58:2> It 's at the heart of what we do.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#59:2> The college encourages faculty to employ undergraduates in their

labs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#60:2> We have more interest in that than we can finance," Hopcroft said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#61:2> Last year, the college spent

&dollar;62,000 from its general fund and alumni donations to finance undergraduate

research positions, with another

&dollar;75,000 from the General Electric Foundation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#62:2> " At some institutions, teaching is simply conveying a body of

knowledge.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#63:2> But here, we want them to learn how that knowledge is created.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#64:2> We want students to understand how engineering research is done, how

it 's funded.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#65:2> We want to foster teamwork and give them an actual design experience.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#66:2> Such experiences may include, for example, designing and building an

SAE Formula race car or hybrid electric vehicle, a concrete canoe or a

pedestrian bridge to be constructed locally.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#67:2> Another curriculum innovation: The college will offer a

bioengineering option for its students.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#68:2> Students who major in an engineering field can take a number of

courses related to bioengineering - the engineering of biological systems -

and will have an official note of this on their transcripts.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#69:2> <h> Dual degrees </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#70:2> Hopcroft also sees cross-departmental, even cross-college,

courses being offered at Cornell.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#71:2> In engineering, students will be able to double-major in, say,

electrical engineering and materials science for dual degrees.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#72:2> " We're going 'rehave to do more, but with less resources," Hopcroft

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#73:2> " We have 215 faculty now, but in five years we'll have 'll.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#74:2> As a result, there will be a lot of cross-college offerings.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#75:2> For example, a student can take a hydrology course, but if it 's

offered in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, why should we

duplicate it?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#76:2> The curriculum is not all that 's new in the engineering college.

The dean points to several initiatives as a priority.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#77:2> For example, the college has hired Gloria Gilford to coordinate

recruitment of minority students and " to encourage them to choose Cornell,"

Hopcroft said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#78:2> " What we want to do is attract the best minority students out there

and to create a campus environment that encourages success."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#79:2> Concurrent with that, the college has hired Claude Poux as

director of the Engineering Minority Programs Office.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#80:2> Said Hopcroft: " We must get the faculty to accept responsibility for

enabling the success of the minority student.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#81:2> It 's not enough just to retain them in the college - and this is true

of every student , not just minorities, not just women - we need to launch

them on successful careers."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#82:2> Although the college enrollment is about 24 percent women -

compared with the national average of about 17 percent - the engineering

college still must make special efforts to keep women in the field.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#83:2> <h> Interaction </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#84:2> " We need to continue to show that engineering is an area where

you do interact with people, a field that is important to many national

problems, and there is value to it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#85:2> We have a quarter of our enrollment women, but we'd li 'd to get that

to one-third.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#86:2> Of the faculty, about 7 percent, or 14, are women.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#87:2> " Really, it 's a commitment to excellence that is important,"

Hopcroft said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#88:2> " In that sense, it doesn't matter if it 's a man, woman, minority, as

long as they are excellent at what they do.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#89:2> And that 's the driving force of the college."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#90:2> A member of the National Academy of Engineering since 1989,

Hopcroft, 54, earned a Ph.D. in 1964 and an M.S. in 1962, both from Stanford

University, and a B.S. in 1961 from Seattle University, all in electrical

engineering. He also is a member of the National Science Board, the governing

board of the National Science Foundation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#91:2> Hopcroft was associate dean for college affairs since 1992,

chairman of the computer science department from 1987 to 1992, and a

professor of computer science since 1972, when he came to Cornell from

Stanford.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#92:2> <h> About the college </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#93:2> Dean: John E. Hopcroft was named dean of the College of

Engineering on Jan. 1.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#94:2> He formerly was associate dean and chairman of the Computer Science

department.</p> < 

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#95:2> Agenda: Undergraduate curriculum changes designed to engage

Students early in their college careers; focus on recruiting and retaining

Minority students.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#96:3> <h> Provost seeks to cut growth of CU 's budget</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#97:3> The growth of the endowed, general-purpose budget will be reduced

by

&dollar;15 to

&dollar;16 million over the next three to five years, including some cuts that will

permanently reduce the size of the workforce.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#98:3> Provost Malden C. Nesheim already has agreed with division and

Department heads on reductions of

&dollar;3.7 million for the year starting July 1.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#99:3> " We are not talking about flat, cross-the-board cuts," Nesheim

said, " but we are talking about cuts in base budgets.
<ICE-USA:W2C-014#100:3> Cutting expenses on office supplies for a year won't do; we' 'vegot

to make the commitment to become permanently leaner."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#101:3> Nesheim, like President Frank H.T. Rhodes, has been talking for

some time of long-term changes in the environment in which universities

live.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#102:3> The end of the Cold War, a less-than-robust economy, keener

attention to the national budget deficit and pressure to direct university

research to practical problems have led, Nesheim says, " to an examination of

the support and relevance of university-based research in relation to social

needs."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#103:3> Uncertainty about federal research funding coincides with cuts

in New York state funding, low inflation and interest rates that have curbed

returns on the university 's short-term investments, and an extended period of

relatively low growth in family income.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#104:3> Beyond these economic factors, Rhodes has repeatedly noted,

universities confront substantial public doubt about their integrity,

efficiency and dedication to undergraduate education.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#105:3> " This new environment," Nesheim said in a recent letter to

university budget officers, " suggests the necessity for much lower rates of

tuition increases over the next few years..."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-014#106:3> The Board of Trustees already has approved 1994-95 endowed

tuition that will rise just 4.6 percent, the smallest increase in two

decades.</p> </I>
