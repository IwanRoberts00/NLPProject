<ICE-USA:W1B-006#1:1> <h> December, 1990 </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#2:1> <h> Dear Ann - - </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#3:1> Hey, woman!
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#4:1> How are you?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#5:1> Just sending some holiday greetings your way and hoping you're doing

well in Cambridge.
<ICE-USA:W1B-00 're:1> I think you quit your job at Cultural Survival, right?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#7:1> So what are you doing now?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#8:1> How are things in your house?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#9:1> I'm no longer working at the Art Institute-I'm now at th 'mNewberry

Library, where Alice used to 'mrk.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#10:1> Everyone there speaks very highly of Alice, I guess she 's in library

school at Berkeley now. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#11:1> I am working in the Public Affairs Department at the library.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#12:1> I help to publicize events and exhibits that happen there.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#13:1> It 's quite a pleasant place to work, the people are very nice.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#14:1> Not great money, of course, but it 's enough to make my loan payments,

so I can't really complain.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#15:1> And I get insurance benefits etc., which is good. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#16:1> How is your life going?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#17:1> Met any new and interesting people?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#18:1> ( I'm sure you have)
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#19:1> If you can 'melieve it, Stuart is going to come visit me and stay here

at my sister 's.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#20:1> Sue is going to come up here for the weekend so he can see both of

us.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#21:1> He 's coming back to The U.S. for about 3 weeks in February, and he'll

spend a few of those days 'llre.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#22:1> It should be interesting, to say the least.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#23:1> He and I didn't part on the best of terms, but I guess that 's all

ancient history at this point. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#24:1> Are you going home for Christmas etc.?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#25:1> I'm going to visit Malcolm in NY City for New Yea 'm's.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#26:1> Malcolm also has a job interview in Chicago so he might be moving out

here for a while.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#27:1> Should be an experience.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#28:1> I guess if he is around I'll be able to decide how I re 'lly feel

about him and the relationship.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#29:1> Right now I'm just not sure. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006 'm0:1> Anyway, things are going ok for me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#31:1> Write and tell me how you are.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#32:1> I think of you often.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#33:1> I played the Violent Femmes the other day and that reminded me of

Freshman year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#34:1> Anyway take care! </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#35:1> <h> Love, </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#36:1> <h> Amanda </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#37:1> <h> Dear Ann, </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#38:1> Hey!
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#39:1> Thanks for writing-- I thought you were dead.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#40:1> Well, not like I've been writing either, I suppose.
<ICE-US 've1B-006#41:1> I'm sending you these two clippings that I tho 'mht might be of

interest.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#42:1> You can flash them around and say " [ - - - - - ] and now he has

attained fame."
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#43:1> I didn't see the play, I didn't even know that Joe was in Chicago.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#44:1> How 's the CFC?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#45:1> I'm still at the Newberry, to which I think A 'mce has returned (

temporarily), although I haven't seen her.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#46:1> Yes, Stuart did visit me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#47:1> He hasn't changed.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#48:1> Neither has Sue, who wouldn't come up to visit him while he was here

because Malcolm was also here at the time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#49:1> So instead, Stuart visited her down in Champaign.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#50:1> It was ok seeing him-- he gave me some interesting gifts from China,

although my family didn't particularly like him.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#51:1> We know what kind of impression he tends to make.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#52:1> But all that was back in Feb.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#53:1> I haven't heard from Stuart lately, and Sue & I are still not really

getting along.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#54:1> Cheryl has come back from Estonia and is job hunting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#55:1> Norma is living in Oberlin with her lover, Laura.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#56:1> Never thought Nora would have a real lesbian relationship?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#57:1> Think again.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#58:1> I guess she 's happy, although poor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#59:1> I visited Ashley in D.C. in April; she 's working for World Wildlife

Fund and is somewhat disillusioned about the future.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#60:1> I'm sorry that you had chicken pox.
<ICE-U 'm:W1B-006#61:1> How is your house?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#62:1> How 'bout your love life?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#63:1> Still want to travel? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#64:1> Malcolm will be going to Indiana U. In the fall to study

folklore/ethnomusicology.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#65:1> I'm thinking about going into museum studie 'm
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#66:1> We'll see.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006# 'll1> I miss you too, I'd like to see you so 'dtime.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#68:1> Ever though about coming to Chicago?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#69:1> Hmmmmm???
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#70:1> Write to me, I'll write more to you too, 'll a time in the future as

yet unforseen. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#71:1> <h> Avec amour, </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#72:1> <h> Amanda </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#73:1> <h> Dear Ann </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#74:1> Howdy buckaroo!
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#75:1> Have yourself a merry little holiday season, if you can stand to.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#76:1> So how are you?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#77:1> Thanks for writing to me a million years ago when you did.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#78:1> Sorry I didn't write back until now, but I'm lazy as all hell, as you

may have 'muessed.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#79:1> I think you asked for my phone number in your letter.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#80:1> [ - - - ] Call me real soon-- ( Ha!
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#81:1> I know you have tons of money, just like me)
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#82:1> So what are your future plans?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#83:1> I read in Oberlin Alumni Magazine today that <@> Jin Huang</@> played

piano at Kristen 's wedding. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#84:1> The Alumni Magazine is so entertaining.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#85:1> I'm still working at the Newbury, still 'miving with my sister.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#86:1> Alice works at Newbury again-- she just got married.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#87:1> My future plans are applying to grad school for library science for

Fall ' 92.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#88:1> Yes, I'm copying Sue, and she & I are barely 'mpeaking.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#89:1> Ah well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#90:1> Here 's some news-- Ashley went to Cairo for a month in

September-she 's now planning to move to Seattle at some point.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#91:1> Cheryl is back from Estonia and living at home and is frustrated.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#92:1> Nora is still in Oberlin.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#93:1> Wally is still in Pittsburgh but I don't know what he 's doing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#94:1> Sue is working as a librarian at University of North Dakota, and owns

a cat and a car which she drove to North Dakota from Boston ( where her

sister is living now) Malcolm is enjoying and stressing about his

ethnomusicology program at Indiana.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#95:1> I miss you, kiddo.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#96:1> Wish I could see you sometime.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#97:1> Of course, I don't have much of a travel budget right now.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#98:1> But drop me a lion if you can-I'd like to hear h 'd you are. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#99:1> <h> Love, </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#100:1> <h> Amanda ( Wheeeeeesz) </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#101:1> <h> Dear Ann-- </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#102:1> Thanks for your postcard of a month ago.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#103:1> I would love to see you in August if you can come out here; however

I will most likely be in NY the week of Aug. 17-21, and sometime the next

week I'll be moving to Bloo 'llgton, Indiana ( ! ) To start my master 's in

library science.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#104:1> I'll be living with M 'llolm, who is still in progress with the M.A.

in Folklore/Ethno.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#105:1> But, if you're able to visit in earl 're August, or even like the

23-26 or sometime in there, I'll most likely be a 'llnd.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#106:1> Real enthusiastic invitation, huh?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#107:1> But I would love to see you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#108:1> Alice is still at the Newberry.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#109:1> She and I went to a Chicago Oberlin Alumni get-together.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#110:1> It was kind of fun.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#111:1> Also, I saw Joe 's name in the paper again the other day.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#112:1> He 's in a production of Salome.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#113:1> What a surprise. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#114:1> Glad to hear you like your two jobs, your friends, and your

love.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#115:1> I'm a bit tired of my job, b 'm I will be leaving it soon ( which

they don't know yet).
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#116:1> Sue stopped by to visit me last weekend on her way back from an

extensive driving vacation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#117:1> She & I are getting along much better, for which I'm happy. </p>

<p> <ICE- 'mA:W1B-006#118:1> So what are your future plans, if any?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#119:1> Still planning to travel?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#120:1> Ashley Just got a job in Boston at Earthwatch, where Sue 's sister

Martha works.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#121:1> So Ashley will be around.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#122:1> Maybe you can look her up and argue about anthropology with her.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#123:1> Heh heh.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#124:1> Well, anyways, I would dearly love it if you came to visit.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#125:1> Let me know if you can.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#126:1> Take care-- </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#127:1> <h> Love, </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#128:1> <h> Amanda </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#129:1> <h> Dear Ann, </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#130:1> Hi-I'm in Bloomington, IN, liv 'mg with Malcolm and going to

library school.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#131:1> My new address is [ - - - - - - ] .
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#132:1> I'm glad you enjoyed San Fr 'mcisco-- my sister just visited there

and really liked it too.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#133:1> Library school is going ok-it 's not the most thrilling, but it 's

alright.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#134:1> I think you would like the anthro-folklore-ethnomusicology programs

here, they're pretty freewhee 'reg.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#135:1> Malcolm really likes the folklore dept., and they seem fairly mellow

to me, too, not all anal & academic as some depts. can be. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#136:1> We live in a small, clean apartment with furniture.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#137:1> It 's worked out ok.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#138:1> Heard this great band from Venezuela - - Ensemble Gurrufio-- two

weeks ago.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#139:1> Boy were they ever excellent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#140:1> I thought of you, of course.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#141:1> Do you have any plans to go to South America soon?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#142:1> Or are you going to journey around the world?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#143:1> I'm going to be living 'm Bloomington for awhile-- my program goes

til Dec. ' 93, and then I'll get a job 'lle while Malcolm works on his

dissertation ( which will take probably 5+ years) Bloomington is bigger than

Oberlin, though, & has a better selection of movies & restaurants.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#144:1> Big sports stuff though; it 's weird being at a Big 10 school.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#145:1> All these people walk around with school colors on on the football

game days. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#146:1> Ashley said you two ran into each other - - bet you're dying to

 're together with her to discuss anthropological theories, right?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#147:1> Heh heh. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#148:1> I'm sorry you weren' 'mable to visit Chicago this summer - -

Alice would have liked to see you too.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#149:1> Actually, she was the one who told me you were going to see

Margaret.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#150:1> Anytime you want to visit Bloomington you're more than we 'reme! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#151:1> Anyway, I'm still adjusting 'mo life here, so I'll stop writ 'll

now & have a cup of tea.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#152:1> Write when you can; hope you are well. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#153:1> <h> Love, </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#154:1> <h> Amanda </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#155:1> <h> Dear Ann </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#156:1> Happy Birthday!
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#157:1> How does it feel to be a quarter century old?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#158:1> I have to harass you about it because everyone made fun of me for

getting " old."
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#159:1> Anyway, glad to hear you are in your own apartment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#160:1> Are you still enjoying your job?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#161:1> I'm almost halfway 'mhrough my library degree, I'll be done i 'll
December.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#162:1> I hope you decide to save this card because I'm putting my ad 'mess

on it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#163:1> See the opposite page
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#164:1> Anyway, I hope you are doing well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#165:1> Have a great birthday </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#166:1> <h> Love, </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#167:1> <h> Amanda </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#168:1> <h> Dear Ann </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#169:1> Thanks for the beautiful armadillo and your marriage wishes.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#170:1> It was kind of funny how we got the package - - we weren't home when

the mail came so we got a card saying we could pick up the package at the

post office.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#171:1> However, the card did not say if the package was addressed to me or

Malcolm, so when we gave it to the guy at the post office, he said, now who

was the package addressed to?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#172:1> We told him it was either Romano or O'Leary, so you can imagine what

a kick the guy got out of the package being addressed to " the Lovebirds." He

laughed his ass off.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#173:1> So anyway, THANKS!!! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#174:1> I'm glad to hear 'mu're alive and 'ret you made it to El

Salvador.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#175:1> I'd like t 'dhear about it sometime.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#176:1> I'm also happy 'm hear that you have a new apartment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#177:1> Forgive my ignorance, but where is [ - - - ] ?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#178:1> Sorry to hear that your relationship ended-- it must have been

pretty tough.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#179:1> I take it you want to quit your job? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#180:1> I'm going to ha 'm my master 's degree by December.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#181:1> I'm looking fo 'mard to being finished with classes; however, I'll be

s 'lling in Bloomington with Malcolm, so it is very unlikely that I can get a

job for which I'm qualified 'm
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#182:1> But, I'm hoping to 'met some kind of position, especially one that

will generously give me time off in May to get married.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#183:1> The date of the wedding is May 22.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#184:1> Hope you can make it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#185:1> If you can, I'd also 'dve it if you would play piano during the

ceremony-- if you'd feel 'dmfortable with that of course.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#186:1> But let me know-- it would be great if you could. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#187:1> My parents are pretty much planning the wedding-it 's going to be

held in the Chicago suburbs of course.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#188:1> My mother is going a little nuts over it, but she 's manageable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#189:1> Malcolm is now a teaching assistant for the course " Intro. to

World Folk Music." It uses the same texts and music that Intro. To Ethno.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#190:1> Used at Oberlin, so we were just listening to the postal workers

today.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#191:1> The class also had that bizarre Indian cinema music as a listening

question on their midterm. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#192:1> So do you live near the Old North Church & all that?
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#193:1> I bet there 's a lot of good food in the area.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#194:1> Sue has a job interview in Boston, I think with Boston U., for a

reference librarian position where she would also be a religion

bibliographer, which she'd be 'dnto because that was her major.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#195:1> I don't know exactly when her interviewer is, but it 's soon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#196:1> I don't know if you knew that Sue 's sister & brother-in-law live in

Boston, too.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#197:1> So, she 's excited about a chance to leave N. Dakota.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#198:1> Of course, now her boyfriend ( who she lives with) is going to have

to try to get accepted to a Ph.D. program in Boston if they want to stay

together, which they do.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#199:1> So that 's her latest dillemma. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-006#200:1> I'm 'mnjoying the lovely fall foliage here in southern

Indiana-it 's nuts the way people get about leaves.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#201:1> I mean, it is beautiful and all that, but really.
<ICE-USA:W1B-006#202:1> Actually, Bloomington is a nice town & I 've come to like it. </p>

</I>
