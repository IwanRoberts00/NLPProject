<ICE-USA:W2A-007#1:1> <h> Paradox of Opportunities:</h>
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#2:1> <h> Lucy Stone, Alice Stone Blackwell,and the Tragedy of Reform</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#3:1> Alice Stone Blackwell, a former suffragette and an internationally

recognized champion of human rights, occupied a seat of honor at the 1939

dramatic interpretation of the Life of her mother, Lucy Stone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#4:1> Because the eighty-one year-old Blackwell was now blind, she relied on

sounds to convey the images portrayed on the stage.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#5:1> Blackwell was pleased.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#6:1> The passage of the Nineteenth Amendment guaranteed the vote for women,

and at the same time, the <quote> Lucy Stone</quote> play, along with

Blackwell 's earlier literary tribute to her mother, <it> Lucy Stone: Pioneer

of Women 's Rights </it> , assured that Stone would continue to hold an

honored position in the history of woman 's suffrage.1</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#7:1> After the performance, Blackwell returned to the bleak isolation

of her apartment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#8:1> Aside from the newspapers and books which cluttered the rooms, the

only decorations were paintings of her family, a group photograph of the

pioneers of the women 's rights movement, and a portrait of her Armenian

godson.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#9:1> The reputations of her famous Blackwell relatives cast a long shadow

over Alice Stone Blackwell, but ultimately, with the woman 's suffrage

victory, her own separate identity emerged through literature, and through

her support for international human rights.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#10:1> While her public career was filled with notable achievements,

privately Blackwell failed to develop the positive self-images necessary to

fully embrace life.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#11:1> Now in her twilight years, she was a nervous recluse, living off the

charity of family and friends, and she was only visited regularly by a hired

reader.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#12:1> As Blackwell retired for the evening, her thoughts may well have

drifted back to the closing scene of the play, triggering memories of a

promise she had made to her mother ten days before Lucy Stone 's death in

October of 1893. <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#13:1> " Mama said to me, as I sat by the foot of her bed, <quote> 'My brave

daughter! She will go on with the work just the same</quote><quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#14:1> Alice replied, <quote> You may be sure she will."</quote>3 Alice

Stone Blackwell was compelled to adopt the mission in life prescribed by her

mother.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#15:1> Lucy Stone was not a brutal oppressor, and there was genuine love

within the Stone Blackwell family, but her obsession with the single goal of

woman 's suffrage dwarfed the preferences of all those around her, including

those of her daughter.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#16:1> Nineteenth-century reformers present a paradox of opportunities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#17:1> While demanding fuller public lives for women, their commitment to

the cause limited not only their own choices, but also those of their

families.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#18:1> Lucy Stone never intended to stifle her daughter 's vitality; she most

certainly believed that she was opening new horizons through her suffrage

work.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#19:1> Yet, Stone 's single overpowering commitment to her mission created an

unnatural environment for her only child, It remains to be proven whether

Alice Stone Blackwell 's experience was typical for the daughters of

strong-minded women of the time period.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#20:1> Other daughters followed their mothers into reform work, but there is

no research that indicates that they followed Alice 's pattern.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#21:1> Perhaps an understanding of Blackwell 's life will serve as a test

case to determine the reform movement 's impact on the family life of the

reformers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#22:1> The eventful lives of Lucy Stone and Alice Stone Blackwell

encompassed the two generations that secured the franchise for women.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#23:1> Along with the first female college graduate in Massachusetts, an

early abolition lecturer, and the first woman to refuse to take her husband 's

last name, Stone established the American Woman 's Suffrage Association, and

founded <it> The Woman 's Journal </it> , along with her husband, Henry

Blackwell, Alice Stone Blackwell was an instrumental auxiliary to Lucy

Stone 's strong leadership.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#24:1> Blackwell wrote prolifically on the suffrage issue, edited <it> The

Woman 's Journal </it> after her mother and father retired from the paper, was

credited with reconciling two rival suffrage organizations into the National

American Woman 's Suffrage Association, and during the excitement of the

suffrage victory, she was nominated as the Association 's candidate for

president.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#25:1> After women won the right to vote, Blackwell wrote several books and

became actively involved in many liberal causes.4</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#26:1> Because previous historians have demonstrated the significance of

both women to the suffrage movement, it is unnecessary to explore their

notable political and professional accomplishments.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#27:1> The focus here is on the complexities of the remarkable

nineteenth-century mother-daughter relationship between Lucy Stone and Alice

Stone Blackwell.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#28:1> Born in 1818, Lucy Stone was the eighth of nine children, who

were raised on a Massachusetts farm by Congregational parents.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#29:1> She described her father, Francis Stone, as cold and distant: he

drank heavily, favored her younger sister Sarah.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#30:1> and ridiculed Lucy 's physical appearance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#31:1> Unable to please her father, Lucy developed an introspective,

resolute disposition.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#32:1> For example, in early childhood, after losing her temper and

apparently screaming at her sister, Lucy determined to rid her behavior of

any further outward displays of anger.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#33:1> While Francis Stone 's nature mellowed over the years, and he

eventually valued his daughter 's many accomplishments, Lucy continued the

pattern of the exacting self-analysis she had established during her

childhood.5</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#34:1> Hannah Stone, Lucy 's mother, not only was a keeper of the home

who was burdened with all the household chores that large families demanded,

but she was also hampered in her domesticity by her husband 's miserliness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#35:1> To ease her mother 's work-load, Lucy washed clothes for the family of

ten before school, and then skipped lunch in order to hurry home and take the

clothes off the line.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#36:1> In later years, Lucy admitted: <quote> I loved her [ Hannah Stone]

more than I did him [ Francis Stone], for she was always kind to

us&"</quote>6
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#37:1> Throughout her life, Lucy Stone endeavored to right the wrongs

committed against her mother.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#38:1> A day before her own seventieth birthday, Lucy wrote:</p> <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X39:1> I trust my mother sees, and knows how glad I am to have been born,

and at a time when there was so much that needed help, at which I could

<quote> lend a hand.</quote> Dear old mother! She had a hard life, and was

sorry she had another girl, to share and bear the hard life of a woman.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X40:1> But I am wholly glad I came, and she is too, if she sees.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X41:1> And whether she does or not, it is right.7</quote></X>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X42:1> Earlier studies have characterized Lucy 's mother as subservient.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X43:1> However, the fact that she fulfilled the role that the nineteenth

century provided for her does not necessarily indicate that she endorsed her

subordinate status.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X44:1> Hannah 's words and actions revealed evidence of malcontent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X45:1> At Lucy 's birth, Hannah remarked that she regretted having a girl,

because life was so hard for women.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X46:1> Years later, Hannah wrote Lucy a letter that contained her insight

on marriage. <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X47:1> " What do you think about Sarah [ Lucy 's sister]?
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X48:1> I think she is very unwise [ to get married] for I do not think she

loves him as she ought.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X49:1> It is a tuff [ sic] case to marry one we do love."8</quote></X>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X50:1> Pivotal to the development of Lucy 's feminist thought was the

collusion necessary between mother and daughter in their everyday-life

struggles with the domineering Francis Stone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X51:1> In order to buy needed household goods, Hannah regularly stole small

amounts of change from her husband 's purse, and she included Lucy in a scheme

to sneak extra cheeses out of the storehouse, to sell in town.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X52:1> Once, as Lucy was about to leave with some cheese, her father

appeared unexpectedly.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X53:1> Lucy remembered: <X> <quote> I was as strong as a young buck.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X54:1> I held the cheese, which must have weighed twenty pounds, close to

me, under my arm, while I led the horse out with the other arm."9</quote></X>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X55:1> While the impact of Hannah 's subtle defiance was not expressly

recorded, it can be extrapolated from family actions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X56:1> and from comments made in later years.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X57:1> When Lucy wanted to attend college, her father may have thought it

unwise, but he did not forbid it and he eventually even helped financially.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X58:1> Like most nineteenth-century men, Francis Stone questioned the

propriety of a woman speaking to mixed audiences, but he did attend a lecture

by his daughter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X59:1> He was so impressed by her abilities that he later admitted, <quote>

You were right, and I was wrong."</quote>10
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X60:1> Lucy 's brothers supported her ambitions, despite the ridicule they

would undoubtedly receive through her notoriety.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X61:1> One brother wrote her concerning her vocation: <quote> I think with

your feelings in relation to women 's rights, you are fully justified in the

course you have taken...."</quote>11
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X62:1> Another brother handed over his church pulpit, for Lucy to give a

suffrage message.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X63:1> Such sentiments and actions lent credence to the supposition that

the Stone family, under Hannah 's influence, came to question what the proper

role for women should be.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X64:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X65:1> Lucy Stone 's obsession with women 's rights resulted from her

youthful conflict between the dictates of her religion and her emerging

feminist thought.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X66:1> When Lucy read in the Bible that it was a woman 's duty to submit to

men, she was not comforted by her mother 's explanation that it was the curse

of Eve.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X67:1> Lucy determined to learn Hebrew and Greek, for she had no doubt that

men had mistranslated the pertinent passages.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X68:1> Never reassured by her Biblical exegesis, Lucy, like many other

nineteenth-century reformers, eventually left the Congregational Church and

joined the more liberal Unitarian Church.12</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X69:1> John and Barbara Maniha, in <quote> A Comparison of

Psychohistorical Differences Among Some Female Religious and Secular

Leaders,</quote> described how new religions were often created from inner

conflicts, such as those suffered by Lucy Stone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X70:1> Stone never established a denomination, but her devotion to women 's

rights acquired all the trapping of a religion.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X71:1> <quote> " The Cause</quote> was all important.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X72:1> and one 's personal needs were to be sacrificed for the greater good

of womankind.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X73:1> Throughout her life, Stone judged herself and others by their

faithfulness to the mission.13</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X74:1> Lucy 's dedication to woman 's suffrage left no room for a

personal life.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X75:1> Like many other pioneers of the movement, she refused to compromise

her independence by marrying.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X76:1> Her ambivalent feelings over her decision are evident in a letter to

Antoinette Brown, Lucy 's future sister-in-law, in August of 1849, in which

she explained that she was staying single in spite of the fact that she would

like to be married.</p> <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X77:1> My heart aches to love somebody that shall be all its own.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X78:1> I have not yet reached the place where I need no companionship as

you have.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X79:1> Do you think I am silly?
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X80:1> Say so if you do.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X81:1> Don't give yourself any uneasiness on my account, for I shall not be

married ever.14</quote></X>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X82:1> Unexpectedly, Lucy Stone found romance with reformer Henry

Blackwell.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X83:1> Initially Stone resisted Blackwell, who was seven years younger than

she, but in time it became increasingly difficult for her to refute his

carefully laid arguments on the feasibility of their marriage.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X84:1> To convince Lucy to relent on her vow of celibacy, Henry agreed to

devote the rest of his life to women 's rights.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X85:1> This made for an unusual marriage, for while Henry was already an

abolitionist, who was not unsympathetic to the suffrage issue, until he fell

in love with Lucy it is doubtful that this movement would have received so

much of his attention.15</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X86:1> In 1857, thirty-nine year-old Lucy Stone, the nation 's leading

women 's rights spokesperson, put everything on hold to have and raise her

only child, Alice.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X87:1> There is no difficulty in understanding her family-oriented goals,

for Stone, a conservative among feminists, accepted the ideology of separate

spheres, believing that woman 's ultimate responsibility was to her family.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X88:1> However, her decision to retire from the movement made her depressed

and unsure of herself.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X89:1> Stone wrote fellow suffrage pioneer Susan B.Anthony:</p> <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X90:1> I went to hear E.P. Whipple lecture on Joan d'Arc.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X91:1> It was very inspiring, & for the hour I felt as though all things

were possible to me.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X92:1> But when I came home & looked in Alice 's sleeping face & thought of

the possible evil that might befall her if my guardian eye was turned away, I

shrank like a snail into its shell, & saw that for these years I can only be

a mother  no trivial thing either.16</quote></X>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X93:1> As Lucy 's despondency grew, Henry insisted that for her own sake

she had to return to her career.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X94:1> Alice, still young when Lucy resumed active campaigning, was often

left with relatives while both her parents travelled to suffrage meetings and

undertook extensive lecture tours.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X95:1> Their absences made Alice feel insecure.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X96:1> Recognizing her anxiety, Lucy and Henry tried, whenever they could,

to provide a normal home life for their daughter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X97:1> Alice remembered the rare times when her mother was at home for an

extended period of time, and <quote> we had the best meals of our lives both

of my parents loved to be at home more than any place else, in spite of the

fact that they were both in the forefront of many a bitter battle."17</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X98:1> Alice 's puberty coincided with the founding of the <it> Woman 's

Journal </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X99:1> One of the goals in beginning this women 's rights publication was to

have more family time, yet the paper came to dominate their lives.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X100:1> Furthermore, Henry became imbued with a sense of failure, as his

attempts to establish a national reform reputation of his own never met his

expectations.18</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-007#X101:1> These external pressures added to Alice 's own internal turmoil

over entering womanhood and striving to establish her own separate identity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X102:1> The result was a power struggle between mother and daughter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-007#X103:1> In the following journal entry seemed to have won the upper

hand:</p> </I>
