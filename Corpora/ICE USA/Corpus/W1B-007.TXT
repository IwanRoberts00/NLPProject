<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#1:1> HI SIS!!!!!!!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#2:1> FYou know, I've always wished that I could wri 'veletters like yours,

but I've always ended up typing these b 'veng informative letters.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#3:1> They're never half as aesthetically 'reeasing as yours are, and usually

not as long, either.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#4:1> Sigh.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#5:1> Oh well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#6:1> Well, you've been awarded a very special p 'vee - - the person who I

took the longest to write to.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#7:1> I really don't know why that is, but I just haven't gotten around to

it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#8:1> I suppose it 's because when I write to you, I want it to be this

mega-awesome letter that you'll absolutely orgasm ove 'll
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#9:1> Well, maybe not quite that good.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#10:1> Anyway, here 's a quick, or maybe not-so-quick update on my life.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#11:1> 1)I started going out with a Japanese woman yesterday
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#12:1> 2)I have found a drumset to use, but as of yet have done little

jamming
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#13:1> 3)Japan and Japanese food remain pretty difficult, although I still

haven't been to McDonald 's yet
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#14:1> 4)I miss school and home
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#15:1> 5)Classes are really bad, and I just found out that all of my grades

count towards my gpa!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#16:1> 6)All in all, I'm pretty busy. </p>

<p> <ICE-US 'mW1B-007#17:1> Well, now to describe those in a little more detail.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#18:1> A few weeks after I got here, I met this really cool woman at a party

at this place near a lake called Karasaki House.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#19:1> Her name was Yuka, and I spent the next several weeks trying to catch

the same train as she did and striking up conversation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#20:1> She was willing enough to have conversation, but she does everything

under the sun, and our schedules conflicted, so we couldn't manage to even

get together for lunch or anything.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#21:1> Plus, there are 10,000 students on this campus, so I very rarely run

into her around campus - - I have to go out of my way to meet her, like

waiting for her train in the station or something.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#22:1> Anyway, one of the ways I've managed to make some frie 've is through

teaching English and going out with my " students" ( Doshisha students) after

our lesson.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#23:1> An even better way to get them talking is to tell them that I'm

interested in a Japanese wom 'm, and what should I do?
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#24:1> So I did this, and got all sorts of conversation about it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#25:1> So it became a sort of habit to ask my Japanese friends what to do

about this Yuka - situation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#26:1> About this time I started talking a lot to this student named Maki

who spent some time in England, so she likes to hang out near our office and

chat.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#27:1> So, we became pretty good friends, and she became my main confidante

for the largely stagnant Yuka thing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#28:1> Now, you're probably thinking that 'reething was going to happen with

Maki, and I must admit I pondered it, because she is exceedingly cool as well

as attractive, but she had been going out with this guy for 2 years, so that

was out of the question.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#29:1> Sort of.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#30:1> Turns out she broke up with him very recently, for reasons supposedly

unrelated to me, and now wants to go out with me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#31:1> Well, we spent most of the past week together, and yesterday we

started " going out," which seems to have about the same connotations here as

it does in America.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#32:1> So, I'm pretty excited about the whole 'mhing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#33:1> I still think a lot about that woman Laura from Bucknell, but she

kept on insisting that I should live my own life while I'm here, and then

this Maki th 'mg happened and well, here we are! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#34:1> As far as music goes, I've had one serious jam sess 've since I

got here, and that was just with this guitarist from Oberlin named [ - - - ]

who will most likely be in any band I form, but I still haven't had much

opportunity to play.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#35:1> This guitarist is into funk, but he doesn't really play like either

of the Jasons I played with.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#36:1> He 's a little more poppy, which isn't necessarily good.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#37:1> He 's really into " not-playing," like arpeggios and random chords,

sort of like [ - - - ] of Rush or [ - - - ] , but not really.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#38:1> Anyway, without a bass player it wasn't much fun, especially

considering his style of play.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#39:1> The drumset I get to use is owned by the club I'm sort of in, called

Lilac 'mainbows ( lord knows why), and its okay - it 's sort of a beat-up Tama

with an okay sound.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#40:1> All I have to bring of my own is a snare and a pedal, which I borrow

from this fat metal drummer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#41:1> The music clubs here have enormous rooms filled with exceedingly

expensive equipment, which just blows away any music scene at Conn.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#42:1> For instance, Lilac Rainbows 's room is about the size of our entire

first floor at home!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#43:1> The only problem is, the bands aren't that good at all.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#44:1> They are all technically good, but they are lacking in raw energy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#45:1> If we weren't that precise and clean-sounding, I think that the [ - -

- ] certainly had a lot of energy, and that 's part of what made us kick so

much ass!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#46:1> Anyway, the other problem here is that Japanese people haven't a clue

how to dance!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#47:1> If I perform, I'm gonna have to import a f 'm of my Conn friends to do

the dancing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#48:1> There are a few spazzy Americans here, so maybe if they get going,

the Japanese people will get into it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#49:1> I sure hope so.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#50:1> Believe it or not, I did a lot of practicing the first month or so.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#51:1> It was even the stuff I should be practicing - - rudiments.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#52:1> However, since Fall Break in Shikoku and catching up after break, I

haven't touched my sticks in ages.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#53:1> I did, however, find this amazing [ - - - ] disc called Master Plan

that kicks ass.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#54:1> Look for it if you get a chance, or maybe I'll send you a tap 'llf it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#55:1> I really want to learn jazz, and also latin styles, but I have yet to

learn how to totally detach one limb and just keep playing the same thing

like one does in jazz and samba.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#56:1> Besides, I need to learn my rudiments first!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#57:1> I really miss the [ - - - ] , and every time I hear another band I

become convinced that there is some sort of future in it, so who knows, hunh?
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#58:1> Our time will come again!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#59:1> By the way, I just bought this bargain Earth, Wind and Fire cd last

night.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#60:1> Pretty funky!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#61:1> They have some amazing horn parts, I just wish they wouldn't do so

many mellow songs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#62:1> Oh well. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#63:1> And now for something completely different - - a man with 9 legs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#64:1> ( " He ran away!!")
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#65:1> Oh bother. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#66:1> So.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#67:1> Things here are busy - - my homestay is good, but we barely talk at

all, because we're all so busy.
<IC 'reSA:W1B-007#68:1> One of the toughest things about living with a homestay is that I

have a curfew - - something I didn't even have when I lived at home!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#69:1> My curfew is 10 on weekdays and 11 on weekends, and it takes an hour

to get home from the city, so I have to leave at 9 or 10 on weekends, which

really limits things, if you know what I mean.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#70:1> I really miss living in a dorm and being able to sit in someone 's

room and just talk or listen to music or show people all my stupid music and

doing drum fills in the air.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#71:1> I still haven't picked up any " traditional Japanese arts," but Will

and I are thinking of starting Aikido ( a martial art) if we have the time

and the money. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#72:1> This class thing has me really bend out of shape, because now

with only 5 weeks ( 4 when you read this) left in the semester, I have to try

and salvage my grades so I don't kill the gpa I worked so hard to get last

semester.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#73:1> Luckily, I've been improving r 'vedly in Japanese, and that counts for

8 credits ( 2 courses), because it meets 600 minutes a week.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#74:1> My test grades have climbed steadily from 79 on the first one to 99

on the last one, and I have another one tomorrow.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#75:1> I really want to end up with a gpa of over 3.5, and at least a 3.67

so I can get summa cum laude.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#76:1> 3.8 is magna cum laude, and that would be fantastic, but I doubt I

can pull that off.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#77:1> Anyway, my sociology class is perhaps the worst course I've taken in

my l 've, so ifs hard to get motivated for that one.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#78:1> Oh well, now 's crunch time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#79:1> If I can pull off an " A" in Japanese, that should help me salvage my

elective courses.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#80:1> Hope hope hope. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#81:1> So, how are things in Mass.?
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#82:1> Mom mentioned something about you getting a job teaching!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#83:1> That sounds like fun, although I've discovered that 'vem far from a

gra 'm-A teacher.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#84:1> .I teach twice a week - - one to a group of 6 or 7 students, and once

to this middle-aged stomach surgeon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#85:1> Some fun conversations there, I can tell you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#86:1> The students are by far the more exciting of the two, but it 's

amazing how bad their English is.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#87:1> I mean, these people take English for about 10 years, and I speak

better than they do after one year!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#88:1> The problem is, they don't do my speaking in class, only reading and

writing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#89:1> They know pretty colossal amounts of vocabulary, but even the ones

who have been to America have a lot of trouble putting together a simple

sentence, and they have a lot of trouble with the pronunication, especially

r 's, l 's, and w 's.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#90:1> They always say " uuman" instead of " woman." Sometimes I just feel

like cracking up in class, but I'm sure they do, 'moo, when I speak in

Japanese, so it 's all even.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#91:1> The doctor is also pretty bad, and I don't really like the 1-on-1

teaching, although I do get 3000 yen an hour, which is above

&dollar;20 an hour.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#92:1> Of course, things here are much more expensive, plus you have to take

public transportation everywhere, so it really isn't that much, but it 's

enough so I haven't had to ask Mom for any money yet, which is cool. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#93:1> The language is just really difficult.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#94:1> I think I speak very well for what I know, but I just have little to

no vocabulary, and I have a lot of trouble understanding, plus I have a lot

more grammar to learn ( verb forms and all).
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#95:1> Of course, it doesn't help that they speak a dialect here called

Kyoto-ben ( " ben" meaning dialect), where all of the verb endings are

changed.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#96:1> It 's pretty much a pain in my ass, and it makes the whole thing

considerably more difficult than I'd hope 'd
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#97:1> You know how everyone says that there 's this point where all of a

sudden you understand everything?
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#98:1> Well, it 's been two months now, and I haven't had that part yet.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#99:1> I do, however, understand most of what they announce on the trains,

which are just as ridiculously precise as everyone cracks them up to be.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#100:1> To give you an idea, I was waiting for a train that was, according

to the clock on the schedule board, about 1 minute late.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#101:1> I overheard these two salarymen next to me talking about it, and one

said, " Tabun, tokee wa kosyoo shite iru n da yo."
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#102:1> Loosely translated, " The clock is probably broken."
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#103:1> Sheesh.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#104:1> Of course, I could have misunderstood.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#105:1> It 's all irrelevant, though, because the trains run so frequently

that I just show up at the station, and there 's invariably a train going my

way within the next 5 minutes, and my station is this piss-ant little one

that only the local trains stop at! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#106:1> Mom said she was going to send you my tape - - I hope you

enjoyed it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#107:1> Unfortunately, I have a big test in about 20 minutes, and I really

have to go to the bathroom, so I'm going 'mo stop here and come back and

finish this after lunch.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#108:1> Of course, it will only be a few seconds to you, but try to picture

me going to the bathroom and taking a test, ( not at the same time,

obviously) and you'll 'll an idea of what my life is like.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#109:1> Actually, you should probably not try to picture me going to the

bathroom.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#110:1> Anyway, talk to you in a few.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#111:1> I guess I'll 'llk about my return to the US when I get back, and I

figgered I'd 'dite this so I don't forget what I'm ta 'ming about... </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#112:1> <h> 11.9.90</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-007#113:1> Okay, so here I am, writing you letter again.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#114:1> It 's now tomorrow ( if such a thing can happen), and I'm b 'mk in the

computer room with good 'ol [ - - - ] , and for some strange reason, I'm
 'mletting her read my letter to you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#115:1> Stop reading!!!!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#116:1> Just kidding.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#117:1> Anyway, once again I'm n 'm going to be able to finish this letter,

because I have to go to class in a few minutes and take an all-too-exciting

kanji quiz that I haven't studied for because I've 'veen bura-bura suru-ing

with Maki.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#118:1> Anyway, about my return to the US, seeing as everyone who writes

asks when I'm 'mming home.
<ICE-USA:W1B-007#119:1> The AKP program ends on May 13th, so that 's the earliest I' 'llbe

home, and after that it 's up to me whether or not I want to stay for the

summer. </p> </I>
