<ICE-USA:W1A-010#1:1> <h> Charles M. Goethe and the Eugenic Imagination</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#2:1> In 1945, the Eugenics Society of Northern California--the

mouthpiece of prominent banker Charles Matthias Goethe--published a pamphlet

that examined the culture of Java.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#3:1> Although he was primarily concerned with the eugenic health of the

United States, Goethe insisted that there was much to be gained from a

transnational perspective: " The eugenist studies these Backward Peoples.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#4:1> [ …] Thus, in the steaming orchid-hung tropics, we will try to unravel

the twisted skein of population problems, common to Malay and Eskimo, to

Hottentot, Lapp, and Berber." My project will examine Goethe 's transnational

view of eugenic theory and application, which he extended from Java to Egypt,

China, Peru, and Nazi Germany.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#5:1> I will use his Eugenics Pamphlets as a key source.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#6:1> These pamphlets, published between 1930 and 1950 provide particularly

rich insights into the heyday of forced sterilization and positive eugenics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#7:1> Although eugenics is usually associated with domestic anxiety about

immigration, minorities, and the decline of white fertility, I propose that

eugenicist propaganda framed this anxiety in a larger structure of fear and

fascination towards Goethe 's so-called " Backward Peoples." By analyzing the

manner in which Goethe 's eugenic imagination addressed issues of culture,

science, and reproduction outside the United States, I intend to illuminate

the international perspective of American eugenics in the early twentieth

century.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#8:1> The bulk of the historiography of American eugenics provides a

powerful narrative of growth that traces the development of eugenics from its

theoretical foundations in England to its most thorough institutionalization

in Western Europe and the United States.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#9:1> It tends to emphasize the domestic concerns of eugenicists while

minimizing the interest they bore towards other countries and peoples, and "

exotic" ones in particular.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#10:1> Daniel J. Kevles' In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of

Human Heredity ( 1985) serves as the standard for the history of eugenics in

the United States and Britain.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#11:1> He discusses the establishment of eugenic ideas by English thinkers

like Francis Galton, and the implementation of eugenic policies in the United

States.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#12:1> Kevles, of course, sets a strictly British/American stage for eugenic

thought.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#13:1> Scholars following Kevles greatly expanded the study of eugenics

in the United States, but still emphasized the domestic worries of

eugenicists over their formulations of the non-American " other." In an

attempt to escape this British/American tradition, some historians began to

examine eugenics in other countries.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#14:1> In 1994, Stefan Kxhl published The Nazi Connection: Eugenics,

American Racism, and German National Socialism, which connected Nazi race

hygienists to American eugenicists.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#15:1> Studies which sought to offer comparative perspectives on

eugenics--such as Mark B. Adams' The Wellborn Science: Eugenics in Germany,

France, Brazil, and Russia ( 1990)--compared and contrasted the development

and implementation of eugenic ideology, but did not emphasize its

international scope or recognize the powerful influence of an international

community of eugenicists.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#16:1> In the past decade, historians of American eugenics turned to

discussing how eugenics affected American women and minorities, especially in

the context of nonconsensual sterilization programs that targeted

African-Americans and Native Americans.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#17:1> Most visible were attempts to enlarge Kevles' preliminary discussion

of how eugenics linked to ideas of womanhood.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#18:1> In Building a Better Race: Gender, Sexuality, and Eugenics from the

Turn of the Century to the Baby Boom ( 2001), Wendy Kline recognizes the

close links forged by eugenic thought to concepts of ideal sexual roles for

women in particular. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#19:1> The most recent scholarship addresses how eugenic ideas worked

into the mainstream consciousness of American life.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#20:1> Again, this work provides powerful insights into eugenics and

domestic life, but offers little about how eugenics pictured cultures/races

outside of the United States.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#21:1> Popular Eugenics: National Efficiency and American Mass Culture in

the 1930s ( 2006) is a collection of essays that analyze how eugenics

manifested in American literature, fashion, comic strips, and film.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#22:1> Another recent work is Alexandra Minna Stern 's Eugenic Nation: Faults

and Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America ( 2005).
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#23:1> It focuses primarily on California as a pulse point for the

implementation of eugenic institutions such as forced sterilization, but also

considers how eugenic ideas touched on such institutions as school

segregation, the Border Patrol, and environmental conservation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#24:1> While all of these works have contributed to an understanding of

eugenics as chiefly an obsession of American/British scientists and

governments about the racial makeup of their populations, they neglect the

distorting mirrors held up by eugenicists like Goethe to other cultures.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#25:1> Although scholars have noted the connections between eugenics and

public exhibits about non-American cultures--for example, the displays of

Native American and African life at the 1933 World 's Fair ( 1)--the

possibilities for exploring eugenics' relationship to American imperialism

are far from exhausted.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#26:1> My work will be a departure from other studies of eugenics in its

close attention to the manner in which these cultures are represented.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#27:1> I have chosen to focus on Charles Goethe because he remains a

deeply controversial figure due to his philanthropy as well as his fierce

devotion to eugenics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#28:1> He also corresponded regularly with eugenicists from Britain and

Germany, demonstrating the transnational nature of the field of eugenics in

the most basic relationships between its proponents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#29:1> Goethe was a founder of the Human Betterment Foundation, which also

included biologist Paul Popenoe, Nobel winner Robert Millikan, and Stanford

chancellor David Starr Jordan.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#30:1> A proud son of German immigrants, Goethe would follow the rise and

fall of the Nazis carefully, and did not hesitate to praise the regime in its

early years for its racial policies.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#31:1> His position as a successful banker--his estate was valued at

&dollar;24 million in 1966--gave him considerable influence in bankrolling eugenic

publications. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#32:1> Most importantly, Goethe was an avid traveler; from the accounts

supplied in his autobiography, Seeking to Serve, he gathered most of the

material presented in his pamphlets from his trips to Palestine, Cuba, "

Grand Leban," Syria, Mexico, Guatemala, Russia, South Africa, and many other

countries. ( 2)
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#33:1> He wove travel anecdotes and photographs into morality tales about

eugenics for his publications.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#34:1> Goethe also highlighted his extensive travels in his

autobiography.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#35:1> Primarily, however, I will use his Eugenics Pamphlets to explore

the international cast of Goethe 's eugenics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#36:1> They were produced for a wide audience; each pamphlet contains a

footnote that offers pamphlets free of charge for classroom use.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#37:1> The style of his writing is also remarkably akin to a brief

travelogue, complete with photographs ( Fig. 1, 3).
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#38:1> The purpose of these narratives, however, is clear: to promote

eugenic ideas by examining the " naturally" occurring trends in " primitive"

populations--overpopulation, disease, or infertility among the ruling groups.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#39:1> However, the manner in which Goethe presents each people differs, and

I hope to scrutinize these differences in order to clarify how each people

fits into the American eugenicist 's schema of racial order. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#40:1> In addition to the standard historiography of eugenics, I have

reconstructed some of the early internationalisms among eugenicists of the

early twentieth century, in order to demonstrate that Goethe 's interest in

non-Anglo-American peoples aligned perfectly with the direction of eugenic

inquiry among a surprisingly diverse group of scientists.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#41:1> Moreover, Goethe 's fascination with these peoples dovetailed with the

hodgepodge of anthropology, statistics, and crude genetics that composed the

foundation of eugenics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#42:1> I identify Goethe--active in publication primarily from 1930

onwards--as a faithful descendant of early eugenicists such as Francis

Galton, who relied on his travel in " exotic" locales to spur his thinking

about populations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#43:1> As a member of the Royal Geographical Society, Galton was well known

for his international exploits: he lived in the Middle East in the mid 1840s

and created some of the first maps of sub-Saharan Africa. ( 3)
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#44:1> These experiences, coupled with his cousin Charles Darwin 's Origin of

Species, led him to formulate the term eugenics; in Better for All the World,

Harry Bruinius noted: " While abroad, he had long been fascinated by the

physical and mental ‘peculiarities’ of peoples like the Hottentots." ( 4)

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#45:1> From 1900-1939, the international eugenics community enriched

Galton 's legacy by relying on vaguely scientific/anthropological accounts of "

Backward Peoples" to create the first substantial pools of academic eugenics

knowledge.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#46:1> At the International Eugenics Congresses of 1912, 1921, and 1932,

scientists from the United States, Britain, and other European countries

presented papers on a wide range of eugenics issues.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#47:1> At the 1912 conference, a paper from the University of Naples, for

example, considered mulattos from Louisiana and " polyhybrids" from the

Philippines. ( 5)
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#48:1> The international nature possessed by these proponents of eugenics is

important to recognize because Goethe attended such conferences and drew upon

the global scope of inquiry espoused by the attendees.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#49:1> Notably, Goethe and his wife were delegates to the Hague

International Eugenic Conference in 1936, and reacted in shock to the

execution of a Russian eugenicist friend, Nikolai Vavilov, in 1937. ( 6)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#50:1> The bulk of my primary source research is complete, and my next

task is to construct a theoretical framework for understanding Goethe 's

particular brand of eugenics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#51:1> My tentative conception of Goethe 's internationalism is to see it as

paralleling some of the strategies of classical anthropology.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#52:1> As such, Goethe 's characterizations of peoples in the Middle East,

Asia, and South America follows classical anthropology 's " schizogenic use of

Time" ( 7); specifically, Goethe described his subjects as existing at an

earlier stage of human development.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#53:1> For example, scattered through his pamphlets, Goethe inserted images

of laborers or porters and captioned these photographs with a description of

primitive, inefficient labor techniques.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#54:1> He followed this sketch with a declaration of superior American

ingenuity in inventing weight-bearing machines, and usually concluded with an

alarming statement about American " race-suicide." ( 8) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#55:1> Potentially, I see Goethe 's pamphlets as fulfilling a mission of

popular anthropology, which bears a tendency towards exoticizing subject

peoples and affirming the superiority of the Western reader.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#56:1> It is important to consider that Goethe offered these pamphlets free

of charge, and especially encouraged teachers to utilize them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#57:1> What kind of cultural work does popular anthropology do?
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#58:1> In Reading National Geographic, Catherine A. Lutz and Jane L. Collins

highlight the questions surrounding a similar publication that presents

non-Western peoples to Western readers:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#59:1> It is not about how " realistic" Western images of that world are

but about the imaginative spaces that non-Western peoples occupy and the

tropes and stories that organize their existence in Western minds.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#60:1> The question then becomes, how do these images purveyed by National

Geographic affect this space?
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#61:1> Do they congeal popular paradigms of evolutionary ascendancy?
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#62:1> Do they emphasize contrastive work and evaluation?
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#63:1> Or do they compel empathy and identification?
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#64:1> Do they in some cases do both, drawing attention with an exotic

element, and then--having captured their readers' attention--inviting them to

imagine how they might feel in the setting depicted? ( 9)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#65:1> Of course, a vital difference between National Geographic and

Eugenic Pamphlets lies in the fact that Goethe crafted each article or "

eugenigram" to convince the reader that at least in America, sexual

reproduction demanded interference in the form of positive and negative

eugenics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#66:1> For example, Goethe inserted supposedly Chinese proverbs--complete

with awkwardly drawn Chinese characters ( Fig. 2)--into many of his

pamphlets.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#67:1> These proverbs provided a bit of intellectual exotica in service of

supposedly universal eugenic principles.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#68:1> Goethe was not interested in the preservation of any culture, but

rather actively desired the transformation of his own.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#69:1> He did not seek only to entertain or titillate, but to provoke

indignation and socio-political action through the rhetoric of eugenic

imaginings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-010#70:1> Discussion of Nazi eugenics is well established among historians

of science, as is the development of American eugenics; however, eugenics is

usually understood to be associated mainly with internal concerns about the

nation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#71:1> Quite plainly, however, Goethe bridged the gap between domestic

worries and his international hierarchy of nations and peoples.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#72:1> Accordingly, most scholarship has not exposed eugenics as an idea

with international ramifications.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#73:1> Understanding the transnational background of American

conceptualizations of eugenic principles outside of a domestic, American

environment will allow eugenics to fit into broader issues of imperialism and

colonialism.
<ICE-USA:W1A-010#74:1> By examining Goethe 's use of non-Anglo-American cultures, I hope to

provide a unique perspective on eugenics' deeply problematic fantasies about "

Backward Peoples."</p> </I>
