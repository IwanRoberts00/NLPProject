<ICE-USA:W1A-005#1:1> <h> " The Comma"</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#2:1> The gods, they say, give breath, and they take it away.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#3:1> But the same could be said - could it not? - of the humble comma.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#4:1> Add it to the present clause, and, of a sudden, the mind is, quite

literally, given pause to think; take it out if you wish or forget it and

mind is deprived of a resting place.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#5:1> <h> Pico Iyer " In Praise of the Humble Comma"</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#6:1> Read aloud Pico Iyer 's catchy example of the comma 's effect and

you will find his point is easily made; the comma 's presence indeed gives

pause to his reflection, and its absence causes voiced exhaustion and a

longing for relief.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#7:1> This experiment illuminates the necessity from which the comma was

born, and looking back to its origins in the ancient world illuminates the

power in its figurative use in literature.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#8:1> M.B. Parkes' study, entitled Pause and Effect, ambitiously

uncovers the history of punctuation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#9:1> In the culture of the ancient world the ideal of a capable orator

dominated the educational process.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#10:1> Democracies thrived on abilities like Cicero 's to present moving

speeches in the tribunals and assemblies, and teaching was directed towards

shaping a generation of pupils into effective public speakers.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#11:1> As spoken language became recorded by the written word, its aural

response was stressed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#12:1> A translation from Augustine 's De Dialectica noted in Parkes' study

supports this ancient reasoning, which was based on Aristotle 's philosophies:

" For what else do written letters reveal than themselves to the eyes, and

apart from themselves, sounds to the mind?" ( 9).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#13:1> Because texts were mostly read out loud, the ideal of a

well-modulated, expressive, and reflective presentation had to depend on

phrasing by means of appropriate pauses.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#14:1> Parkes quotes Ausonius, a fourth century poet and grammarian, as he

advised his grandson that " phrasing ( distinctio) enhances meaning, and

pauses give force to dull passages" ( 9).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#15:1> This ancient concept of phrasing is the basis of the comma 's

earliest signification.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#16:1> The 0.E.D. attributes the comma 's root to the Latin and Greek,

meaning " piece cut off" or " short clause", and its earliest use in Greek

rhetoric and prosody is as a " phrase or group of words less than a colon (

q.v.).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#17:1> Hence, a short member of a sentence or a period."*1
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#18:1> Parkes characterizes the comma in this sense as " usually short and

rhythmically incomplete, followed by a minor disjunction of the sense where

it might be necessary to pause" ( 302).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#19:1> These early distinctions were made by amanuenses who transcribed

spoken language to provide an aid for inexperienced pupils; they were not

made by the texts' original authors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#20:1> During the next centuries culture began to shift its focus

towards a value for the written word apart from its dependency on speech.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#21:1> Texts were circulated among silent readers as writing became a valid

means of transferring information and ideas into an expanded context of

education.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#22:1> The importance of pausing to emphasize and interpret meaning also had

significant impact on transcriptions of the Bible and Christian liturgy.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#23:1> Punctuation was added to individual texts by individual silent

readers to insure that they were properly understood.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#24:1> By the sixth century this shift in emphasis developed into a concept

of the written word as a direct signal from the mind to the eye.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#25:1> Parkes' notes that Isisdore of Seville departed from Augustine 's view

of letters as signifying sounds of things we think, letters as signs without

sounds.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#26:1> He attributed to letters the power to convey silently the sayings of

those who are absent.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#27:1> Recognizing the power of the written word to preserve the testimonies

of the past, Isidore created an account of punctuation that addressed the

needs of new generations of readers; this resulted in punctuation 's

appearance in original texts, as well as its addition to texts already

existing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#28:1> As punctuation developed in form still based on rhetorical

principles of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, so did the marks used to express

and signify each constituent part of a sentence.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#29:1> The hand shaped forms of these marks in the Middle Ages varied,

developing no standard until the advent of early type faces in the fifteenth

century.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#30:1> The comma-mark emerged, so called because it was used to indicate

pause at the end of a comma, or briefest clause of the sentence.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#31:1> The low-placed semi-circular slip, " a kind of printer 's smudge",

says Iyer in his tribute, first appeared as the figure we recognize today in

the 1494 version of a type set by the printer Aldus Manutius.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#32:1> Punctuation 's use as a " road sign placed along the highway of

our communication", says Iyer, has undergone change since literary styles

have developed as expressions of the times.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#33:1> Witness the difference in tone that a heavily punctuated passage in a

Victorian novel such as Dicken 's Bleak House conveys in comparison to the "

the 36 unbridled, almost unperioded and officially censored prose" ( Iyer,

80) that represents Molly Bloom 's private thoughts in Joyce 's Ulysses.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#34:1> Punctuation is much more than imposed law and order in our discourse;

its pauses and intervals still affect our feelings and figure greatly in our

interpretations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#35:1> The power in the figurative definition of the comma, stated in

the 0.E.D. as a " break of continuity, interval ( or) pause" depends on our

knowledge of its origin and extends outward in its impact on literature.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#36:1> Shakespeare uses this representation of the comma as a figure in

Hamlet as he makes the plea for a truce between England with the lines, " As

peace should still her wheaten garland wear/And stand a comma 'tween the

amnities" ( V,11,42-43).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#37:1> The force that Shakespeare 's comma contributes to these skillfully

articulated lines results in nothing less than the fulfillment of Hamlet 's

motive - a convincing forgery of a letter from Claudius to the King of

England that spares Hamlet 's life from Claudius' murderous plot and

sacrifices the lives of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#38:1> Much lighter in tone, but still evocative of the comma 's origin, is

this example from the 1887 text, Poor Nellie, which makes the reader

smilingly ponder upon the ramblings recorded by " a lady who writes so easily

that there hardly seems to be a comma to her mind between any two subjects

under the sun, and never a full stop" ( O.E.D.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#39:1> v3, 666).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#40:1> A contemporary work that uses a figural expression of the comma

to develop its theme is Nicholson Baker 's Room Temperature.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#41:1> Baker constructs the life of his main character, Mike, from a

sequence of free associations that he makes during twenty minutes spent

giving his six month old daughter her afternoon bottle.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#42:1> Baker 's technique involves more than listing random thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#43:1> He skillfully sweeps us along as Mike embarks on this series of

mental flights, but he always brings us back to the rocking chair where he

sits and feeds the six-month old " Bug".
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#44:1> His carefully related snatches of experience and recollection are

connected by this interval in the present, this pause that breaks the

temporal structure of the story, and it is this pause that provides us with

the sense of continuity that Baker 's character wants us to recognize.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#45:1> We learn exhaustive details - " every item of autobiographical

interest - every pet theory, minor observation, ( and) significant moment of

shame and happiness" ( Baker, 41) in Mike 's life; we learn about his

fascinations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#46:1> One' of these fascinations is with the comma.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#47:1> How Baker gives power to Mike 's obsession with the comma is by

honoring it as an " oasis of respiration" ( Baker, 66).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#48:1> Although he does provide us with the poignant reminiscence of

eliciting his mother 's tears because he harshly criticized her incorrect use

of the comma in a spirited letter to the editor, most of Mike 's musings view

the comma to be " real as opposed to grammatical breath" ( Baker, 66).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#49:1> Breath, that the gods give and take away, provides the key to

life.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#50:1> The vignettes of life revealed by Mike are filled with images of

breath.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#51:1> In one chapter Mike watches the Bug drift off to sleep as she sucks

from her bottle; he exhales a " slow, longish puff of air" ( Baker, 22)

across the room to flutter a delicate mobile made by his wife, Patty, and he

recalls a moment from their courtship with these words.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#52:1> When Patty and I were engaged and had just rented an apartment

together, three times I heard her in another room making sighs of happiness ...
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#53:1> possibly overlaid with some relief, or with the fading presences of

bad earlier fall seasons when we broke up on weird pretexts... ( Baker,

22).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#54:1> Just a few moments, but many memories, later he blows gently on

his daughter 's forehead because " she was going to sleep too quickly, before

she had finished enough of the bottle," ( Baker, 34), and he exclaims that "

she made a lovely voiced sigh or hum of exhalation, not unlike Patty 's sounds

in the first weeks of our engagement..." ( Baker, 34-35).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#55:1> This discovery is followed by admiration for her instinctual ability

to breathe through her nose and suck from her bottle simultaneously, it leads

to a discourse on hereditary nasal predispositions, and then to the nicknames

resulting from those different types of noses.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#56:1> From there the connections expand exhaustingly; a fascination with

the Bug 's nostril recalls the " innocent perfection of a Cheerio" ( Baker,

39), which conjures up the " smooth rim around the pistil of the brass pump

head that you fitted over a tire stem 's valve to inflate it" ( Baker, 39).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#57:1> Next comes a complex analysis that imparts air 's life-giving

properties to inanimate objects: balloons, tires, and red rubber inflatable

balls.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#58:1> Finally Mike returns to the Bug - to her capability of inhaling "

air 's transparent liters through a pair of miraculous one-sixteenth inch

portals and as a consequence to live..." ( Baker,4O).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#59:1> We begin to see that Mike 's incredibly long-winded ramblings are

pulled together with quite a remarkable connection.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#60:1> That connection is his daughter 's life; Mike discovers that "

everything was beginning to route itself through the Bug" ( Baker, 116).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#61:1> Baker 's way of accentuating this connection is to develop the images

of life-giving air, or breath, and to translate them into a figure that marks

a transition between occurrences, the figure of a comma.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#62:1> Mike 's stories let us see the comma as it plays in his present, his

past, and his future.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#63:1> We view his attempt to decipher the sweeping motion of Patty 's

hand along the page of her journal as she forms her commas and expresses the

lull in her thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#64:1> We learn that Mike 's hard-earned achievement in playing an etude on

the French horn without pause is diminished when his music teacher decides

that the breath commas are indeed necessary, and we smile when, upon leaving

Eastman School of Music, he says, I decided to transfer to Swarthmore and

spend my time reading prose and writing papers, where commas could be stuck

in and taken out without the risk of physical injury ( 65).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-005#65:1> We hear his fantasy about writing a definitive treatise on his

favorite mark of punctuation - could Mike be the ultimate expert on

transition?
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#66:1> We listen to him expound on the origin of the comma as a " point of

momentary breath-held stillness between two phrases" ( Baker, 73), as he

imagines how Manutius, the printer mentioned as setting the comma 's

modern-day image in our minds, " resolved the informal kinetics of its

written formation into a mechanically graphical symbol, retaining " all its

original expressiveness, miming the extenuating dips of the hand we use when

taking exception to a point in polite conversation" ( Baker, 67).
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#67:1> As Mike works himself into a " state of reverence" for this "

inclusive flip of the pen ( Baker, 67), wondering how it would feel to be

recognized at scholarly gatherings as the " fruitcake" who sees the comma "

as the embodiment of civilization, as the true 'volute' in evolution" (

Baker, 76), we sense that he is near his reflective journey.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#68:1> He says, ... the Bug herself, whose shape - big head, tapering

extremities - when I first saw it glowing on the ultrasound screen, ... had

introduced a quiet... moment of retrospective suspension in my life that

elevated the whole undistinguished serial succession of years that preceded

it into something that made sense, something with the unity and introductory

of the first clause in a complex sentence.
<ICE-USA:W1A-005#69:1> The breathing Bug was civilizing me; she was my comma ( Baker,

76-77). </p> </I>
