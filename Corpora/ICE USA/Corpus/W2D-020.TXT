<ICE-USA:W2D-020#1:1> <h> How to Hike</H>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#2:1> If walking quickly is too uncomfortable for you as a fitness

program, consider learning how to hike.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#3:1> Hiking allows you to opt for longer walks at a more moderate pace.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#4:1> In terms of energy costs, a day-long hike up hills and down winding

paths is similar to running a marathon.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#5:1> But when it comes to taking in the sights, smells, and sounds as you

go, hiking is tough to beat.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#6:1> Where you choose to hike will depend, in part, on your interests.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#7:1> If you enjoy watching birds, for example, you may want to pack your

binoculars and head for a swampy area like the Everglades National Park,

which is known for its ornithological richness.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#8:1> If you're interested in plant life, you ma 'reant to plan a spring or

summer hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where you'll find a
 'llrilliant display of rhododendrons and azaleas.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#9:1> If you just want to get out into nature, you may want to join the 20

million hikers and backpackers who put the national and state parks to good

use each year. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#10:1> Chances are you'll find a n 'llonal, state, or local park in your

area that offers scenic trails for hiking.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#11:1> Trail maps are often available to guide you; some show estimates of

mileage and may indicate the degree of difficulty of the trails.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#12:1> Even if you live in an urban area, you'll probably 'll able to find

forest or wildlife preserves nearby that you can roam for a few hours.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#13:1> It 's a healthy and inexpensive way to escape the noise and traffic of

the city.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#14:1> It 's also a good way to prepare your body for lengthier hikes across

rougher terrain. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#15:1> Your state board of tourism may be able to provide you with

information about state and local parks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#16:1> Local chapters of hiking groups and environmental organizations may

also be able to assist you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#17:1> To find out more about national parks in your area, contact the

National Park Service.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#18:1> This article has essential information for learning how to hike,

including how to prepare for a hike, what to wear, what to pack, and how to

stay safe.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#19:1> First, let 's look at how you should prepare for a hike.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#20:1> Continue to the next section for the details.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#21:1> <h> Preparing for a Hike</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#22:1> Before you head out on the wilderness trail, you'll need 'll

prepare yourself for the greater intensity of hiking.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#23:1> Once you've completed the Starter and Basic Walki 'vePrograms, you

should be able to walk comfortably on level ground for four or five miles at

a time.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#24:1> Rarely will you find a hiking path that 's smooth and level.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#25:1> So you'll need 'll condition your body for tackling hilly terrain.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#26:1> To do this, choose a four- or five-mile route near your home that has

plenty of inclines.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#27:1> Since walking up and down inclines takes more energy than walking on

level ground, you may have to begin at a pace that 's slightly slower than

your usual walking speed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#28:1> Walk the entire length of this route three or four times a week for

several weeks, until you can manage it comfortably at a moderate pace. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#29:1> Your next step is to practice walking on hilly terrain with

weight on your back.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#30:1> Even if you'll be 'llcking to short day hikes, you'll pro 'llly need

to carry a few things with you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#31:1> So fill your hiking pack with items you're likely to take, incl 'reng

a filled water bottle or two, a small first-aid kit, insect repellent and/or

sunscreen, a raincoat or poncho, a sweatshirt, and some snacks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#32:1> Then walk that four- or five-mile hilly stretch a few times a week

for several weeks while carrying your filled pack. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#33:1> Once you've completed this round of conditi 'veng, you should be

ready for a day hike.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#34:1> You'll nee 'llo successfully complete a few day hikes - - and practice

walking with a heavier pack - - before you'll be 'lldy for an overnight trip.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#35:1> For your first hike, choose a well-marked trail that you can cover at

a moderate pace in less than a day.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#36:1> As you hike, choose a comfortable pace.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#37:1> You'll be 'llking for several hours, so don't race through the first

mile.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#38:1> Be sure to give yourself rest stops, too.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#39:1> You may want to try stopping for about ten minutes each hour.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#40:1> More frequent breaks may cause you to lose momentum.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#41:1> If you absolutely need to rest a little more often, however, by all

means do. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#42:1> Take advantage of the information in the next section to make

sure you dress appropriately for your hike.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#43:1> You'll als 'lleed a sturdy, comfortable pair of hiking boots or

walking shoes designed for off-road terrain.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#44:1> Be sure to break them in gradually by wearing them around the house

before you take them on the road.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#45:1> Invest in a good pair of socks to protect your feet from blisters.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#46:1> Nicely padded Orlon socks or wool socks with nylon liners work well.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#47:1> Get more preparation tips by reading the next section of this

article.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#48:1> It details the other items you should pack for your adventure.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#49:1> <h> What to Pack for a Hike</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#50:1> Use these guidelines to determine what to pack for your hike.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#51:1> The first item on your list of things to carry is water, even if

you're taking a short h 're.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#52:1> It 's all too easy to become dehydrated during a hike, especially in

warm weather.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#53:1> So you'll ne 'llto drink plenty of water as you go, even if you don't

feel particularly thirsty.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#54:1> You can't count on finding drinkable water along your route, so

you'll ne 'llto carry enough for your entire hike.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#55:1> If you're planning a sh 're hike, you may be able to get away with one

bottle of water.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#56:1> For longer hikes, try filling three or four containers so that you

can distribute the weight evenly in your pack. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#57:1> The next item on the list is food.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#58:1> Hiking takes a lot of energy - - at least 300 calories an hour ( more

if you're hiking at a b 'rek pace or on rugged or uphill terrain).
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#59:1> Even if you eat an extra-large breakfast before you begin, you're

likely to 're hungry on the trail.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#60:1> Because you'll pr 'llbly have to carry all the food you'll ne 'll try

to choose foods that are nourishing yet low in weight and bulk - - and easy

to prepare in advance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#61:1> Particularly in hot weather, avoid bringing perishable foods, such as

milk products and raw meat, that can spoil easily. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#62:1> Sandwiches as well as snacks of nuts, dried fruits, and dry

cereal are favorite choices.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#63:1> They'll pr 'llde you with the carbohydrates you need for energy.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#64:1> A variety of dehydrated foods are also available, but these require

water to make them edible.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#65:1> Another essential item is a small first aid kit.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#66:1> This kit should contain bandages or sterile pads and tape,

antiseptic, and aspirin or another painkiller.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#67:1> In addition, you may want to carry a pocket knife or a small pair of

scissors, matches, a small flashlight, biodegradable toilet paper, insect

repellent, and a good sunscreen.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#68:1> You may also want to bring a compass along.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#69:1> If you have a map of the area, be sure to keep it handy. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#70:1> To carry all these items, you'll ne 'lla pack.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#71:1> The type you choose depends on the length of the hikes you intend to

take.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#72:1> If you plan on taking short hikes, a fanny pack or day pack should be

large enough.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#73:1> If you go on overnight hikes, however, you'll ne 'lla backpack that 's

a little roomier.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#74:1> Packs come in a variety of models, sizes, materials, and colors.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#75:1> Some have internal frames, others have external frames.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#76:1> To find a pack that 's right for you, visit a sporting goods store or

outdoor gear store that has knowledgeable salespeople.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#77:1> Discuss with them the type of hiking you'll 'lldoing, the supplies

you plan to carry, and the amount of money you're willi 'reto spend. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#78:1> Be sure, however, to try the pack on before you purchase it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#79:1> You'll 'llthe one carrying it around, so you'll 'llt it to suit your

body frame and feel comfortable.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#80:1> The pack should conform to your back.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#81:1> It should also have adjustable, padded shoulder straps and an

adjustable waist belt that will allow you to distribute the weight of the

pack to your hips as well as to your shoulders.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#82:1> Once you've taken sev 'vel day hikes, you may want to try an overnight

hiking or backpacking trip.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#83:1> For these trips, you'll 'lld to carry more supplies, including extra

food and water, a sleeping bag, a powerful flashlight, a change of clothes,

and perhaps even a tent and a small camping stove.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#84:1> This collection of necessities can add up to a heavy load. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#85:1> Government researchers have found that carrying more than 25

pounds of weight for long periods can do more harm than good by straining the

shoulders, back, and knees.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#86:1> This research grew out of complaints from soldiers who had to carry

heavy packs during long marches.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#87:1> So it may be best to limit the load you carry on a hiking trip to 25

pounds, if it 's at all possible.To cut down on weight, try choosing

nourishing foods that don't need to be cooked, so you won't have to carry

cooking utensils.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#88:1> If you're p 'rehasing a sleeping bag, tent, stove, or other equipment,

choose lightweight models. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#89:1> You know that a first-aid kit is an essential safety item to take

along on your hike, but there are other ways to protect yourself from harm

while hiking.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#90:1> These are explained in the next section.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#91:1> <h> Hiking Safety</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#92:1> There are several safety issues associated with hiking.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#93:1> Part of the pleasure of hiking is the opportunity it gives you to

explore wild areas and experience the wonders of nature.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#94:1> Even if you're h 'reng a trail for the second time around, you'll 'll
discover many new sights and sounds.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#95:1> But you can prevent some unpleasant surprises by taking a few

precautions on the trail.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#96:1> As a general safety precaution, it 's best to walk with a companion,

especially on long treks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#97:1> Before you venture out, it 's also wise to let someone at home know

where you'r 'reoing, which trail you intend to follow, and when you intend to

return.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#98:1> When you'r 'ren the trail, avoid drinking water directly from

springs, streams, or lakes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#99:1> No matter how clean and clear it looks, the water may be contaminated

with a host of parasites and bacteria introduced by people or animals

upstream.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#100:1> Boiling the water for at least one minute may help destroy some of

these organisms.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#101:1> Portable water treatment kits are also available to help you purify

water in an emergency.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#102:1> However, the best way to avoid illness from contaminated water is to

pack and carry your own drinking water.</p>

<p> Poisonous plants are another trailside hazard.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#103:1> To guard against getting rashes from poison ivy, poison oak, and

poison sumac, wear clothing that covers as much exposed skin as possible,

particularly on the feet and legs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#104:1> Wear long pants, socks, and shoes or boots.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#105:1> When you return home from a hike, remove your hiking outfit and toss

it in the washing machine.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#106:1> Use care when removing your hiking boots or shoes: The plant oil

that triggers the rash can easily stick to the bottom or sides of your boot

where it has come into contact with one of the offending plants.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#107:1> So try to remove your footwear without handling those areas, or you

could inadvertently touch the lingering oil, spread it to your face or other

parts of your body, and end up with a nasty rash even after you've 'vet the

woods.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#108:1> If you do develop a rash from one of these plants, try applying an

over-the-counter remedy, such as calamine lotion, to relieve itching. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#109:1> Don't panic if you've 'ven bitten by a tick.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#110:1> Not all ticks carry Lyme disease - - a tick-borne illness that can

cause chills, fever, headache, and other serious complications.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#111:1> Generally, a tick must remain on the skin for 24 to 48 hours in

order to transmit the organism that causes Lyme disease.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#112:1> If you remove a tick from your skin, save it in a small container of

alcohol, so that if a suspicious infection develops, the tick can be analyzed

for Lyme disease.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#113:1> There is no need to see a doctor for a tick bite unless you notice

any signs of swelling or redness around the bite ( a sign of infection), a

bull 's-eye-shaped rash ( often a symptom of Lyme disease), a fever, or a skin

rash. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-020#114:1> If you' 'regoing on an overnight trip in the wilderness, you can

protect your food - - and yourself - - from wild animals by stringing your

food up at night.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#115:1> Place all food, as well as toothpaste, lotion, and other

pleasant-smelling items, in a corded bag or your pack.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#116:1> Then string the bundle up high between two trees.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#117:1> If you 'll be hiking in an area that isn't off-limits to hunters, be

sure to wear something bright, especially during hunting season.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#118:1> Orange caps are very popular for this purpose and are available in

waterproof and breathable materials.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#119:1> Finally, before you head out, be sure to do research on how to

prevent conditions like heatstroke, frostbite, and dehydration while you 're

on the trail.
<ICE-USA:W2D-020#120:1> Combine that with the information in this article to make your

hiking experience pleasant and problem-free. </p> </I>
