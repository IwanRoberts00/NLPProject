<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#4:1> Transcription of therapy session with Evelyn Luckenbach, September

28, 1981 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#5:1> Therapist shows Evelyn a picture and asks her to describe it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#6:1> The father plays ukelele, holds it near to his face and croons to

his daughters, those with smudged faces and smiles of ignorance.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#7:1> He walks always on the sunny side of the street, he has no worries.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#8:1> But that girl in the yellow dress holding her knees, the one whose

face, if we look closely, is tight with her smile, that girl already doesn't

know how to drop her worries. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#9:1> There are other songs, songs about railroad men, traveling

salesmen, hoboes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#10:1> All the men in the songs live happy and carefree, wandering the

country with their pipes and bedrolls, leaving their worries on someone

else 's doorstep. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#11:1> " Sing the song about Charlie," the girl in the yellow dress asks

every time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#12:1> This is the one where the man comes home to a family and brings gifts

and sings of his travels.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#13:1> The chorus is something funny, something he makes up new every time

just to make her laugh, and with this one, because he knows she likes it, he

looks into her eyes and sings directly to her. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#14:1> The breath is always warm and smells tonight of metal, as if he

has eaten a chain link fence.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#15:1> The whorls and creases of his hands filled with grease, fingernails

black with it, but his face is clean and unlined, he is young still and his

hazel eyes are surrounded by absolute white. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#16:1> If they knew where they were already heading, one step at a time,

wouldn't they pause longer here?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#17:1> In this hollow moment with just the ukelele, the untainted voice of a

young man dreaming, the love of the girls that shows in their eyes like

something taken for granted. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#18:1> The mother is in the kitchen making a batch of fudge.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#19:1> She is still trying.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#20:1> When her girls listen to their father sing songs about freedom, she

paces around the kitchen in her pant suit, thumbs through a cookbook, tries

to imagine what does a normal mother do now?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#21:1> " Make fudge," Betty Crocker tells her and the mother follows

directions still. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#22:1> Two cups sugar, two squares unsweetened chocolate.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#23:1> It says something that she even has these things on hand. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#24:1> The pant suits were a gift from the father the same year that all

the scarves and flowered skirts appeared in the ditch down the road.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#25:1> Walking around the block the two sisters come upon such familiar

things: their mother 's scarves, her blue silk kimono, the pastel nightgowns

that always smell like her, bangles, flowered skirts, the blouse with all the

animals of the zoo walking across its yellow background in black patterns.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#26:1> What would an ordinary child do?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#27:1> Run home thinking their house had been robbed?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#28:1> Inform the mother that all her best clothes were in the ditch around

the block?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#29:1> These girls do not think to question such an occurrence.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#30:1> If everything in the house were in the ditch, there must be a reason.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#31:1> If their mother herself were there, or if the girls woke up in the

middle of the night covered in leaves, listening to traffic whiz by, what

could they do but say their prayers, roll over, and dream?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#32:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#33:1> The elder girl takes the blue kimono and stuffs it in her shirt

as a memento.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#34:1> She will sleep with it under her pillow and smell it for years, even

after the scent of her mother is only something she creates. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#35:1> The mother is still trying, she has on the pant suit and her hair

rises in a teased puff sprayed into place.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#36:1> Her cuticles have been removed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#37:1> She has the purple pants with the green blouse and even the girls

know that they should be worn in matched pairs, but she does try and that

means everything tonight while the father sings and strums and the girls sit

transfixed. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#38:1> She stirs and cooks and waits for 234 degrees on the candy

thermometer, not one degree more.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#39:1> She lets it cool to exactly 120 before beating in the vanilla.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#40:1> Then as the fudge lies hardening, she tries to remember to put

softness in her face. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#41:1> The mother poses for the picture with her pan of fudge in one

hand and the house keys in the other.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#42:1> She is not getting ready to leave, but holds onto those keys because

she loses them otherwise and the father gets angry and doesn't allow her to

leave the house unlocked. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#43:1> Her face is hard and wild, the smile a forced form like the hair

and clothes, the hands still stiff at her side and she stands on tiptoes as

if she is about to sprint.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#44:1> Her eyes aren't hard to read, even at this distance.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#45:1> They say 'here 's your damn fudge' at the same time that they demand

collaboration, expect the girls to participate in the myth of her great

mothering. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#46:1> But the secrets are beginning to come out in her face and she

keeps her hands busy partly so they don't begin painting the walls, spreading

the fudge all over the white kitchen walls in patterns and words.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#47:1> That won't happen tonight though.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#48:1> Tonight, she cuts the fudge, gives the girls each a piece, gives the

man two. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#49:1> This mother, I try to understand her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#50:1> I can see how she struggles to hold herself there, to keep the hands

from dropping boiling water on the children.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#51:1> This mother, when she finishes frying chicken, she leaves the hot oil

in a pan at the edge of the counter where a curious young child could pull it

towards her, looking for fudge, or dinner maybe. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#52:1> I don't know what her secrets are, only that they demand

something of her, they expect her to drop everything and pay tribute to what

they say in tiny, squirrely voices. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#53:1> This mother did not give any part of herself to her children, she

let them come through her but she remained untouched.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#54:1> Now she feels no allegiance to them, no special compulsion to feed

them, stroke their hair, give them something safe to dream on.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#55:1> Kiss me goodbye, her eyes are already saying. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#56:1> This is home.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#57:1> A rented duplex on a dead end street with a train charging by every

half hour at dinnertime and once or twice even in the middle of the night.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#58:1> The girl in the yellow dress can't sleep through the noise though she

counsels herself every night not to be scared by the sudden roaring, by the

silence afterward. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#59:1> The girl in the yellow dress is easily frightened and the father

enjoys scaring her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#60:1> " You'll 'll a kick out of this," he tells his friends before

sneaking up on the girl and saying " boo!" in his deepest voice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#61:1> The girl always jumps, always gives a short squeal, and then stands

with pounding heart in the circle of laughing men. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#62:1> There are many ways to frighten her and when she cries he says, "

You're s 'reensitive," in a voice of awe and confusion.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#63:1> She is sensitive, if that is the right word.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#64:1> That is why, even on this night when the father sings and jokes, when

the mother works in the kitchen baking fudge, even tonight, the girl in the

yellow dress reads something in her mother 's eyes, feels the tremors as the

train roars by and knows they convey more truth than anything else </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#65:1> They live in a duplex and the girl imagines in the other half of

their house lives a mother and father, two daughters, a ukelele, a pant suit,

a yellow dress.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#66:1> In every house she imagines the same family arrangement, the same

mothers and fathers, always two daughters, but never one sensitive like her,

one who scares so easily and feels alone even in a world populated by

families just like her own, all up and down the street. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#67:1> The father hands her a jar of peanuts and when she opens it a

coiled snake on a spring pops out in her face causing her to scream and drop

the jar.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#68:1> Her father laughs and laughs, wiping his eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#69:1> " You should have seen your face," he says, " Jesus." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#70:1> There are the girls in their Easter dresses, white hats, gloves,

anklets and white shoes with buckles on the sides.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#71:1> The dresses are almost the same but the elder girl likes more lace

and frill and the younger demanded a simple hat, one without ribbons.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#72:1> Standing side by side you can tell they are sisters by the features

and the way they both incline their heads slightly to the side, as if even as

they smile for the camera, they are asking a question. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#73:1> I think they are asking who will be fooled by these photographs?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#74:1> Who will see us in our white dresses and hats, our flowery anklets

and buckled Mary Janes and think we are ordinary children?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#75:1> Will they look at us and imagine bedtime stories, romps across the

living room floor with Daddy, shopping and cooking with Momma?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#76:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#77:1> Maybe they stand a little straighter thinking that at least in

this frozen image they are two little girls, adorable, who couldn't love

them?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#78:1> Look at the oleander in bloom behind them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#79:1> You can tell it is a beautiful spring. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#80:1> It is a shame I cannot feel more for them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#81:1> Even the father is innocent still, but the girl and I know what is to

come and knowing that, how can we forgive them this small happiness, this

night of tender ukelele playing, hopeful fudge baking, innocent picture

taking?
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#82:1> The potential outcomes have not yet been narrowed, but none in this

family is strong enough to hold off the train rumbling down its tracks to

meet them head on. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#83:1> I think he knew his wife wouldn't stay in the kitchen in the pant

suits and teased hair much longer, so the father began snapping pictures of

the mother almost every day, something for the girls to remember maybe.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#84:1> In the pictures where he has taken her off guard, I can see most

clearly the pain on this woman 's face, the future covering her eyes in

shadows deeper than the flash could penetrate. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#85:1> In one photograph, the image of the mother is blurred because she

is still moving, caught in the motion of turning around to the photographer,

her husband.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#86:1> The expression on her face is so angry, so hostile it frightens even

me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#87:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#88:1> How it must have awed those two little girls.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#89:1> Imagine, their father merely says, " turn around, Honey," and the

woman produces a look like that, like a trapped animal ready to kill. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#90:1> The mother kept back a piece of herself when she gave birth to

her daughters, she couldn't let go.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#91:1> Now she has too much inside, struggling to be spoken or painted or

sung.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#92:1> And the girls are not whole.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#93:1> I wonder if they ever will be. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#94:1> The mother moves through the world in such a way that the girls

will only be ghosts following after, never filling in their own lives but

trying to take the burden off her, hoping she will give them that piece they

need, the missing information, the last drop to make them full, or if not

that, then at least the fix they need to keep on a little longer: the small

love-filled words she occasionally spoke, a moment when she truly saw them,

then smiled, then pulled them close. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#95:1> This is home, these rooms with perfectly white walls, the red

stuffed chair and flat, hard, green sofa.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#96:1> The bedroom where the parents sleep in warm, soft sheets the color of

skin, the side porch where the girls lie on twin cots watching the moon move

shadows, listening to conversations so private they are hissed and whispered

and wept. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#97:1> This is home, where the mother is overfull and the girls feel

empty, where the father 's wandering feet are only temporarily nailed down.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#98:1> This is home: two girls overwhelmed by love for two imperfect parents

who are still trying, still young and hopeful and innocent, still unaware of

how quickly and easily everything could be broken, even the girls, even them.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#99:1> " You know a lot about them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#100:1> Yes, I do know a lot about them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#101:1> It seems I can just look at the pictures and imagine, but I have

always imagined too much.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#102:1> Maybe I am just making it up, pretending, make-believe.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#103:1> It 's a great game. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-013#104:1> " I don't think you are making it up.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#105:1> I think you are remembering.
<ICE-USA:W2F-013#106:1> You havedone a lot of work today and we 'll continue tomorrow." </I>
