<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#3:1> This is a novel of the internet era that involves stock market

manipulations, detective work via the internet, and tracking down a kidnap

victim.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#4:1> It will be serialized on the Web, pending book publication. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#5:1> <h> Chapter 1</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#6:1> I HATE DOORBELLS in the morning for all the usual reasons.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#7:1> Also because it 's usually the middle of the night before the elegant

solution is finally found.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#8:1> Don't ask me why.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#9:1> We joke about a wave of epiphanies sweeping around the globe, leading

the dawn by a few hours, as computer wizards rise from their keyboards,

congratulating themselves. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#10:1> Wizards of the female persuasion seem to finish an hour sooner,

closer to three o'clock than four.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#11:1> That 's discounting, of course, the false alarms - - those premature

epiphanies of the more testosterone-soaked wizards, which start about

midnight. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#12:1> And it was only two o'clock last night when I finished my

call-screening software.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#13:1> I pedaled my exercise bike triumphantly for an hour thereafter, to

allow my brain to slow down, and then I crawled into bed, feeling thoroughly

virtuous. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#14:1> Technically speaking, I was awake when I heard the doorbell.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#15:1> Indeed, I was just starting my wake-up shower, my favorite bootstrap

to higher levels of consciousness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#16:1> Being in a very good mood, I only muttered pro forma curses as I

stepped out of the stall and pulled on my terry-cloth bathrobe. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#17:1> Uh-oh.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#18:1> The bathrobe was missing its belt, for some reason.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#19:1> I reminded myself that I gesture a lot with both hands, and the belt

is an essential precaution against an abruptly plunging decolletage.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#20:1> This disconcerts visitors. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#21:1> As I stood posed in front of the mirror contemplating the

alternatives, the doorbell spoke again, more firmly than before.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#22:1> I could always, I supposed, pull on my bikini and pretend I was wet

from the beach. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#23:1> Hmm.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#24:1> In late October?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#25:1> In Seattle?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#26:1> At ten in the morning?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#27:1> Perhaps not.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#28:1> I found a thin robe in my closet and headed out through the living

room, leaving wet footprints as I tied the robe.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#29:1> This better not be a salesman, I muttered, or I'll invent a version

of RingCon 'lll that will selectively silence doorbells as well as telephones.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#30:1> Then I saw the police uniform through the window.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#31:1> Great.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#32:1> I opened the door and lifted an eyebrow.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#33:1> " Good morning," I said tentatively, somewhere between a statement

and a question. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#34:1> " Are you feeding the cats downstairs?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#35:1> " asked the cheerful young officer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#36:1> I relaxed instantly, and somehow slipped into fast-talking actress

mode.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#37:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#38:1> " I am indeed looking after Max 's cats," I replied in mock

exasperation, opening the door wider and smiling at the officer standing on

my second floor deck.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#39:1> " What have they done this time?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#40:1> " I asked him, crossing my arms and leaning my shoulder against the

door frame with a theatrical sigh.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#41:1> " Started shoplifting at the corner grocery?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#42:1> It 's really only Cleopatra that plots these things, officer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#43:1> Siam 's quite innocent.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#44:1> How much do I owe the store for the potato chips?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#45:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#46:1> Ever helpful Kate, that 's me - - the Medicean madcap, running on

at the mouth.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#47:1> The policeman smiled, while trying to get a word in edgewise. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#48:1> " When did you last see Max Hempelman?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#49:1> " he asked, finally.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#50:1> " A few weeks ago, when he left for Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#51:1> Why?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#52:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#53:1> " Have you got an address for him?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#54:1> Know a place where we can reach him?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#55:1> " he persisted.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#56:1> " Even just a phone number?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#57:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#58:1> I suppressed a real sigh because - - well, it was a big secret

that I wasn't supposed to know about.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#59:1> I had immediately jumped to the conclusion that our esteemed county

prosecuting attorney wanted some more free advice from Max.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#60:1> And was getting impatient with Max 's travels.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#61:1> It was, after all, the final week of his re-election campaign.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#62:1> " Well, I got a postcard from Max a week ago.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#63:1> An absolutely lovely picture of a genuine Palm Beach swimming pool.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#64:1> Want to come in, while I try to find it?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#65:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#66:1> That 's about when I realized that I'd forgotten to turn off th 'd

shower.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#67:1> I pulled my thin robe tighter in compensation for this

all-too-audible shortcoming.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#68:1> Let him think that I showered with a companion, I thought,

remembering that California bumper sticker from drought days, Don't Shower

Alone! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#69:1> " It 's back in the kitchen," I said, a little too loudly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#70:1> " That 's where the old mail resides on its way to the recycling can.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#71:1> One of these days, I'm going to rig a chute down t 'mthe alley, so all

the junk mail can go straight into the recycle.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#72:1> And land with a satisfying crash."
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#73:1> My mind wasn't really in gear yet.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#74:1> Those were just warm-up exercises.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#75:1> I'm better after a shower, a gl 'ms of grapefruit juice, and a double

shot of espresso.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#76:1> Honest. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#77:1> I rummaged through the accumulation on the back of the kitchen

table, laying aside the old Wall Street Journal and New York Times issues

that needed tossing out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#78:1> And there the postcard was, showing an unnaturally blue swimming

pool, surrounded by nondescript hotel balconies totally lacking in

individuality, topped by some cottony clouds that looked like overdone

digital retouching to my jaundiced eye. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#79:1> I looked at the flip side.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#80:1> " It 's the ` Sunrise Hotel on Route A1A,' it says here.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#81:1> Not his usual sort of hotel, I must say.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#82:1> He usually stays at the best place in town."
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#83:1> I passed him the postcard after noting that Max hadn't written

anything more than a sarcastic " Dearest Kate - - Don't know what you're

missing.
<ICE-USA: 're-011#84:1> Love, Max." Max knows my opinion of Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#85:1> As a former New Yorker, Max was expected to like Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#86:1> His daughter did.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#87:1> But he didn't. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#88:1> " Postmarked October 19th?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#89:1> And you haven't heard anything else from him since then?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#90:1> No phone calls?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#91:1> " I shook my head, no.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#92:1> E-mail messages on the internet would have been far more likely, but

there hadn't been any of those, either.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#93:1> " Know anyone else that might have heard from him?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#94:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#95:1> " Just his daughter in New York - - he usually talks to her every

weekend."
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#96:1> It was beginning to penetrate my thick head.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#97:1> This wasn't what I had blithely assumed. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#98:1> " Is she the next of kin?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#99:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#100:1> I was getting alarmed, finally.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#101:1> " Yes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#102:1> His wife died a long time ago.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#103:1> Now, suppose you tell me what 's going on?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#104:1> What 's happened to Max?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#105:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#106:1> The patrolman was busy typing into his little clipboard

computer, his thick black fingers just as nimble as my long white ones.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#107:1> " All I know is that we've got a missing-person 've query from the

Palm Beach P.D.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#108:1> A hotel got worried when he didn't check out, and left his suitcase

behind in the room.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#109:1> Then it turns out that a boat he rented for a week wasn't returned."

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#110:1> Max, missing?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#111:1> Max, of all people?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#112:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#113:1> IF MINDS CAN UNDERGO A CHANGE OF PHASE, the way that H2O goes

from water to steam, that 's when mine popped out of actress mode.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#114:1> It snapped into dead-serious mode and didn't lighten up for days.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#115:1> " Well, didn't they conduct a search?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#116:1> " I asked indignantly, rising to my full six feet. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#117:1> He squinted at the display on his clipboard and poked a key

repeatedly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#118:1> " Seems the Lantana cops found some kids using the sailboat." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#119:1> " Lantana 's just south of Palm Beach on the coastal waterway," I

explained, trying to curb my rising impatience.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#120:1> Or was it panic?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#121:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#122:1> " The kids eventually admitted that they had found it washed

ashore a few days earlier.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#123:1> And naturally, since the kids hadn't reported finding it, no Coast

Guard search was ever conducted for him," he continued, paging down through

the file.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#124:1> " It seems to have taken a few days for all of the jurisdictions to

consult one another - - and then wire Seattle." He added a grimace of

disapproval, as if the Seattle Police were more efficient. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#125:1> " But that simply does not make sense," I said emphatically,

shaking my head in disbelief.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#126:1> " Max knows all about boats.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#127:1> He 's one of those absolutely careful people who never makes a stupid

mistake, because he 's thinking two steps ahead, all the time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#128:1> Never even drinks beer when he 's sailing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#129:1> And he 's in good health too.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#130:1> He may be 70, but he plays tennis twice a week, and beats most of

his friends too.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#131:1> Certainly me." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#132:1> The policeman, whose name tag read " Freeman", was tapping it

all into his clipboard computer, one almost as fancy as those used by the

parcel service delivery people.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#133:1> He took down parts of my description of Max: three inches shorter

than my six feet, perhaps 165 pounds, an athletic build despite the rounded

waistline, a full head of white hair, a wicked tongue, intelligent brown

eyes, perpetual half-moon reading glasses, and a book in hand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#134:1> Sometimes two.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#135:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#136:1> " Has he ever gotten lost or confused?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#137:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#138:1> " Max Hempelman get lost?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#139:1> He 's the least likely person I know," I said, standing up straight

and pulling at my thin robe, which was sticking to wet spots.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#140:1> " Max always knows exactly where he is, almost intuitively.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#141:1> I found that out when he introduced me to piloting float planes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#142:1> And, if he did get confused, he 's one of those people who has a GPS

chip inside his belt phone that gives a readout of his exact latitude,

longitude, and altitude from triangulating on satellite signals.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#143:1> No, Max Hempelman is not likely to get lost - not unless he 's had a

stroke or something." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#144:1> " Any idea why Mr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#145:1> Hempelman was visiting Florida?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#146:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#147:1> " No, can't say as I do know," I said, pondering, realizing that

I really ought to know the answer to that simple question.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#148:1> " And I know him pretty well, too.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#149:1> He 's never mentioned any friends in Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#150:1> He travels there on business when he can't avoid it - - he 's a

consultant on things like mergers and takeover attempts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#151:1> The last time he was in Florida, about a year ago, it was to Palm

Beach for a board of directors meeting or something like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#152:1> The Breakers, as I remember." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#153:1> " Is that a company?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#154:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#155:1> " No, an elegant old hotel and golf course." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#156:1> " Know the name of the corporation?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#157:1> " Officer Freeman asked, hopefully. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#158:1> " No.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#159:1> But it was only a temporary consulting deal, that last time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#160:1> He had to make a presentation at a board meeting about checking out

a merger proposal.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#161:1> He left as soon as he could.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#162:1> He really doesn't like Florida, and would never go there for a

vacation." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#163:1> " I'll put al 'llhis on the net," he said, tapping away.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#164:1> " But can you also tell me his daughter 's name and address?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#165:1> They'll want 'llnotify next-of-kin." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#166:1> " She 's still in New York," I explained, " but I don't remember

whether she 's changed her last name.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#167:1> I've nev 'vemet her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#168:1> She 's one of those insular New Yorkers who seldom travels west of

the Hudson River - - probably thinks it 's all like Joisy but even worse as

you go farther west." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#169:1> Officer Freeman smiled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#170:1> I wasn't trying to entertain him, however, so much as trying to

cheer myself up. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#171:1> " But I probably have her name and number in a computer file.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#172:1> Come on into my office." It opened off the kitchen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#173:1> Large computer, large-screen monitor, split keyboard, and the most

comfortable office chair I could find.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#174:1> Bookshelves everywhere except for windows and doorways.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#175:1> " She sometimes takes winter vacations in Florida, but Max never

visits her there," I continued.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#176:1> " He hates the place.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#177:1> Besides, if he visits her in Manhattan, he can get in his semiannual

dose of art galleries at the same time." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#178:1> Should I offer him some coffee?
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#179:1> I badly wanted some myself, I realized as I touched the keyboard.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#180:1> But, before I could say anything, my personalized menu popped up on

the screen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#181:1> In a flash, it popped into the name-and-address file and found Max 's

daughter.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#182:1> As well it should: I am always customizing my own computer so that

it obeys my whims, instantly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#183:1> I'm t 'ming to get it to anticipate me, but that 's another story.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#184:1> " Carrie Hempelman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#185:1> And that address," I said, pointing at the screen, " is on the Upper

East Side.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#186:1> Max gave the address to me about five years ago, when he was going

to be in China for several months, as someone to call if I needed some more

money for the remodeling on our duplex.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#187:1> He 's always thinking ahead like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#188:1> I hope his daughter hasn't moved since then.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#189:1> She 's got a rent-controlled apartment, so she probably hasn't." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#190:1> I finally realized that I was rambling on and on.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#191:1> And so came to an abrupt stop.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#192:1> To cover my confusion, I hit the function key that autodials the

phone number displayed and then picked up my desk phone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#193:1> " Let 's phone her," I said, purposefully.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#194:1> " Maybe she can clear this up." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-011#195:1> But a machine answered in New York.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#196:1> I listened to the whole announcement, evidently her everyday

version.
<ICE-USA:W2F-011#197:1> Prompted by the beep, I left my name and number, adding that it was

urgent that she phone me back. </p> </I>
