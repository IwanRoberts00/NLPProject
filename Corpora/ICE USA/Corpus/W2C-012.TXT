<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#1:1> The Menino Administration reached a tentative agreement yesterday

with a Boston-based developer to build 715 rental units with underground

parking near the convention center.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#2:1> But the deal immediately was challenged by two of South Boston 's

elected officials.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#3:1> Boston Redevelopment Authority officials and Cathartes Investments

agreed on a

&dollar;150 million project that will include 65 affordable units and land for an

additional 65 affordable units, sources said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#4:1> The deal was completed after Cathartes, whipsawed by a battle for

control of waterfront development, threatened to withdraw its housing

proposal and seek a commercial development, sources said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#5:1> The BRA deal would preclude a controversial deal Cathartes

negotiated last spring with the South Boston Betterment Trust, a nonprofit

group whose role in waterfront development is being opposed by Mayor Thomas

M.Menino.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#6:1> Under the current deal, Cathartes will build 65 of the affordable

units, while nonprofits, including the Betterment Trust, may bid for the

right to build an additional 65.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#7:1> The original Cathartes-Betterment Trust deal called for the

developer to turn over 25 percent of its land and

&dollar;750,000 to the Betterment Trust, which planned to build 130 affordable

units.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#8:1> But BRA spokesperson Susan Elsbree denied an agreement had been

reached.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#9:1> City Council President James M.Kelly predicted the new BRA deal

with Cathartes will be opposed by South Boston residents and indicated he

will continue to defend the original Betterment Trust deal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#10:1> " The units Cathartes originally proposed was more than the

neighborhood wanted, but because there were benefits offered to the impacted

neighborhood, a majority was prepared to support Cathartes," Kelly said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#11:1> The Betterment Trust may go ahead with its threat to sue Menino

for breaking a 1998 " memorandum of understanding" empowering the Trust,

Kelly said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#12:1> " There 's a possibility that all development, or at least

Cathartes, will come to a grinding halt," Kelly said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#13:1> State Sen. Stephen F.Lynch said there is " general opposition to

the mass of the project" while questioning whether a 715-unit project could

clear state environmental hurdles.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-012#14:2> <n> 'Best' hole proved fatal: Boy killed in cave-in at beach was to

leave soon</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#15:2> <h> Thursday, August 24, 2000</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#16:2> Moments before 13-year-old Ivan Smith was to leave Salisbury

Beach Tuesday night, the Andover boy took one last cannonball-style jump into

a deep hole that he and his three friends had spent all day digging.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#17:2> Rescuers tried to save 13-year-old Ivan Smith.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#18:2> ( Staff photo by Mike Adaskaveg) But the triumph of creating the "

best ( hole) we ever dug" ended tragically when the hole 's walls caved-in

from the impact of his jump, causing the piles of sand the boys had shoveled

out of the hole to fall in and bury Smith.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#19:2> Smith, a paperboy who would have been an eighth-grader this fall,

was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#20:2> " The mother had gone to get something and had come back down to

get them.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#21:2> They looked like they were heading out," said Cory, a 15-year-old

Lawrence boy who befriended Smith and his three buddies on Tuesday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#22:2> " They were just having fun and digging," said Cory, who did not

want his last name used.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#23:2> " He wanted to jump."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#24:2> Cory, other witnesses and a neighbor said Smith had spent the day

at the beach with three neighborhood brothers, and his mother, Nancy T.Smith.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#25:2> His older brother, Nicholas, and his brother 's female friend, who

were both in wheelchairs, were also with them, witnesses said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#26:2> Smith and his three pals started digging what would become a 3

1/2-to 4-foot deep hole with a plastic shovel at about noon, witnesses said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#27:2> Other youngsters at the beach stopped by throughout the day to offer

a hand.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#28:2> By the end of the day, beachgoers said they couldn't see the

boys' heads as they shoveled out sand from inside the hole and piled it on

the beach around them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#29:2> The three boys took a break to play pool, continued to dig and

took turns jumping in the hole - which they dug on a stretch of sand between

the 5 O'Clock Lounge and the Beach Club on Ocean Front Street, witnesses

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#30:2> One of the boys was climbing out of the hole as Smith made his

final jump, but managed to get free before the heavy, soft sand collapsed on

Smith, Salisbury Fire Chief Paul Antonellis Jr.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#31:2> said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#32:2> Witnesses said the boys began digging their friend out and ran

into the nearby 5 O'Clock Lounge for help.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#33:2> When Smith 's mother returned, witnesses said she began to panic

when told that her son was beneath the sand.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#34:2> She began scooping with her hands and crying for her son.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#35:2> When rescue workers arrived, Antonellis said the area where the

hole had been looked like regular beach, with no evidence of where the boy

was except for the friends telling rescue workers where to dig.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#36:2> " There were no indentations and the area hadn't been disturbed.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#37:2> We almost thought it was a joke," Antonellis said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#38:2> Antonellis said the boys might have been digging one to three

minutes before calling for help.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#39:2> But because of the hole 's depth and the weight of the sand, the

result probably would have been the same even if a crew was " sitting right

there," Antonellis said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#40:2> Rescue workers rushed to the scene at about 8:15 p.m., using

buckets and their hands to reach the boy 's head, which they unearthed in

about 15 minutes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#41:2> Antonellis said when they reached the boy 's head, he was not

breathing and there was no sign of a heartbeat.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#42:2> It took them about 90 minutes to pull him out.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#43:2> Eric Ramsdell, who lives near Smith 's North Tanglewood Way home,

watched rescue workers with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#44:2> " We were digging a really big hole," he told The Daily News of

Newburyport.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#45:2> " The best we ever dug."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#46:2> Yesterday, witnesses left crosses and flowers at a makeshift

memorial where the boys had dug the hole.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#47:2> To Andover neighbors Larry and Esther Taylor, Smith was like a

son.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#48:2> Smith rode his bike and walked to school with their 12-year-old son

Jared.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#49:2> " He went camping with our sons and stayed overnight.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#50:2> They were like brothers," Larry Taylor said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#51:2> Jared said his friend had two cats and wanted to be a

veterinarian when he was older.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#52:2> Smith, who is the son of Andover Town Accountant Rodney Smith,

had just finished working at a camp run by the Massachusetts Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Esther Taylor said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#53:2> Smith was also a catcher for a Little League baseball team.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#54:2> " He was the glue of the neighborhood.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#55:2> He got everybody together.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#56:2> We're going to 'ress him a lot," Larry Taylor said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#57:2> His principal at the Doherty Middle School, Floyd McManus, said

Smith was well-liked by teachers and peers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#58:2> " He excelled at physical education and Latin.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#59:2> He was his own person and well-respected," McManus said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#60:2> " My heart goes out to the family."</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-012#61:3> <h> Ethics panel cites contrite Swift on one count </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#62:3> A contrite Lt. Gov. Jane Swift expressed " regret for everything

that 's happened" after the State Ethics Commission yesterday cited her with

one ethical violation but cleared her of four others.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#63:3> Lt. Gov. Jane Swift talks to reporters yesterday.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#64:3> " I owe an apology to the citizens of Massachusetts," Swift said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#65:3> " I made some mistakes and I'm sorry for 'mhem."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#66:3> Swift 's repeated apologies came just minutes after the ethics

panel all-but cleared her of wrong-doing, saying she had done nothing wrong

by using a state police helicopter to beat pre-Thanksgiving traffic and

asking aides to help her family move from Boston to Northbridge.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#67:3> The commission, after a five-hour meeting, found only that Swift

had created the " appearance of impropriety" by asking two staffers, Susan

Saliba and Sarah Dohoney, to babysit for her daughter on their own time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#68:3> But the panel said babysitting by a third aide, Stacey Rainey,

who is now Swift 's deputy chief of staff, did not create an ethical

issue.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#69:3> The commission found no problem with Swift 's practice of asking

staffers to watch her daughter, Elizabeth Ruth Hunt, while the toddler was

visiting her mother in the State House.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#70:3> In clearing Swift of charges that she misused the helicopter, the

four-member commission rejected a staff recommendation that found "

reasonable cause" to believe the chopper ride constituted " unwarranted" use

of a privilege of her office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#71:3> The panel, whose deliberations are confidential, did not release

details of its decision last night.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#72:3> Swift 's lawyer, Cheryl Cronin, said she expected the commission

to release a letter explaining parts of the decision later this week.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#73:3> The commission could have imposed a

&dollar;2,000 fine on Swift for the babysitting violations but instead left the

terms of any punishment to be negotiated by ethics staffers and Cronin.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#74:3> Despite the near-vindication Swift said she not feel relieved by

the decision, but rather only " regret" for the disappointment she caused

people who put their trust into her.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#75:3> Swift, who was engulfed in a political firestorm in January when

she refused to take responsibility for the chopper flight, also sought to put

her earlier defiance behind her.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#76:3> Characterizing the last few months as " difficult" and "

uncomfortable," Swift said she intends to approach the future by working hard

on issues such as education.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#77:3> " It will be up to me to prove to the voters that the confidence

they placed in me almost two years ago was warranted," said Swift, a

Republican.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#78:3> " I think I have a lot of work to do to achieve that."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#79:3> She assured the voters that she would not to commit the same

mistakes in the future, promising a " bright line" between her personal and

professional life in the future.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#80:3> But Ken White, executive director of Common Cause/Massachusetts,

said Swift 's personal resolution was not enough.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#81:3> " I'm surp 'msed the administration has not reacted in a

comprehensive way ? by putting into place stricter procedures and policies on

ethics," White said, calling on the administration to rescue a comprehensive

1995 ethics reform bill from its " legislative graveyard."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#82:3> And Swift refused to hold herself to a higher standard than the

one set by the ethics commission, ducking a question about whether she would

reimburse the state for the estimated

&dollar;1,000 cost of the chopper.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#83:3> " For today ( I plan to abide by that commission 's decision)

that 's the most important message I have," she said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#84:3> But Swift, 35, clearly recognized the damage she has caused to

her political career.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#85:3> " I think that there is no doubt that I made mistakes and the

public has lost some confidence in my ability to provide leadership on the

issues they care about," Swift said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#86:3> Swift 's tenure has been plagued with scandals and consequential

low approval ratings since media reports disclosed that she tapped taxpayer

funds for her own personal use.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#87:3> She also recently forced to resign from a teaching post at Suffolk

University that many viewed as overpaid.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#88:3> Swift 's infamous helicopter ride last Thanksgiving to escape

holiday traffic triggered public criticism, which turned into outrage when

she attempted to defend her actions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#89:3> A week after the flight was made public, Swift finally apologized

and sent a letter to the State Ethics Commission asking whether she misused

state resources and should reimburse taxpayers for the cost of the helicopter

flight.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#90:3> But the state troopers that were part of her security detail

testified before the commission that they, not Swift, ordered the chopper for

security reasons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#91:3> The three aids who babysat her daughter - two of whom Swift

helped land lucrative promotions - denied that they felt any pressure from

Swift to babysit, citing their longstanding friendship with the lieutenant

governor.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-012#92:4> <H> Key Sox adviser jumps ship on ballpark: Menino pal 's departure

may jeopardize project</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#93:4> In a potentially devastating blow to the Red Sox' plans for a

&dollar;665 million ballpark, development consultant Bob Walsh has bolted the

project as the team enters a critical juncture in its two-year pursuit of a

new field of dreams.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#94:4> The surprise departure leaves a huge void between Sox CEO John

Harrington and Mayor Thomas M.Menino, since Walsh served as a critical

go-between in the often-stormy relationship.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#95:4> " It seemed to be in the best interests of our company," said

Walsh, who notified Harrington two weeks ago that RF Walsh Inc.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#96:4> was severing its relationship with the Sox.
<ICE-USA:W2C-012#97:4> " We' 'rein the project management and construction business, not

government relations."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#98:4> But it was Walsh 's relationship to Menino and his familiarity

with the machinations at City Hall that were invaluable to Harrington.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#99:4> The Sox chief angered the mayor more than once during delicate

talks over a massive

&dollar;313 million public subsidy package.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-012#100:4> " We totally appreciate his involvement in this," said Red Sox

spokeswoman Kathryn St. John, adding that Harrington and Sox General Manager

Dan Duquette have open lines of communication with the mayor.</p> </I>
