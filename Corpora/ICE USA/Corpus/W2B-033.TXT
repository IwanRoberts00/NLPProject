<ICE-USA:W2B-033#1:1> <h> Bridging the Computer Gap</h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#2:1> <h> By Susan Drenning and Lou Getz </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#3:1> " You can teach an old dog new tricks!," commented an 11-year-old "

teacher" after introducing his 60-year-old " student" to computers in

Computer Ease.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#4:1> When asked what he would add to the three- session course the

enthusiastic 60-year-old said, " 52 more weeks!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#5:1> Computer Ease is an intergenerational computer literacy program to

increase utilization of existing equipment and staff.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#6:1> Computer Ease is a collaborative effort between the Upper Arlington

Senior Center and Tremont Elementary School.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#7:1> Both agencies are located adjacent to one another in Upper Arlington,

Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#8:1> The senior center is sponsored by the city 's parks and recreation

department, under the direction of Ken Thompson. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#9:1> In 1986, Senior Program Coordinator, Susan Drenning noticed a

widening gap between her center participants and their grandchildren.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#10:1> Grandparents complained to her that their grandchildren were glued to

computers when they visited.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#11:1> Meanwhile, the grandparents were developing a fear of computers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#12:1> Even if the grandparents wanted to learn about computers, the only

computer courses available to them were expensive and too fast paced or only

available in the evening.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#13:1> Consequently, grandparents were having problems communicating

effectively with their high- tech grandchildren. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#14:1> Haven't we all had a fear of computers?
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#15:1> Remember the day a computer was placed on your desk?
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#16:1> You were expected to use it or lose it ( the job that is).
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#17:1> Some people close to retirement chose early retirement over computer

literacy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#18:1> Others simply avoided their computer for several months hoping it

would go away.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#19:1> Meanwhile children were becoming computer literate in schools across

our nation as schools responded to social expectations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#20:1> Computer Ease bridges the gap.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#21:1> Developed by teachers David Heigle and Lou Getz in collaboration with

Senior Center Director Susan Drenning, Computer Ease is designed to ease

older adults into the world of high tech through the patient, uninhibiting

instruction of elementary school students. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#22:1> Goals of the program include: * Providing a hands-on,

uninhibiting computer experience for older adults.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#23:1> * Allowing students to switch from learner to mentor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#24:1> * Creating an awareness of each other 's attributes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#25:1> * Increasing self esteem for both age groups. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#26:1> Computer Ease sessions are held four times a year in computer

labs at Greensview Elementary School as well as Tremont Elementary School.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#27:1> Older adults ( 60 to 96) and their young teachers ( ten to 11) work

one-on-one for one-and-one-half hours, three times per session. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#28:1> In the first class, the older adults learn why and how schools

use computers to teach geography, mathematics, spelling and social studies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#29:1> They use computer software programs such as " Where in the World is

Carmen San Diego," " Concentration" and " Oregon Trail. " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#30:1> Next, participants learn to design their own personalized

letterhead and greeting cards using Apple 's Print Shop.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#31:1> They often create cards for their grandchildren.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#32:1> In the final meeting, the students use Appleworks to help their older

buddy use the computer as a word processor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#33:1> The older adults often write a letter to their grandchildren to show

their new-found computer literacy and their appreciation for their student "

teacher". </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#34:1> This program brings out the best in both age groups.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#35:1> Students seem to view the older adults as older peers who are also

learners.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#36:1> They are on their best behavior and often invite their older friends

to participate in other intergenerational programs between the senior center

and the school, or to Grandperson 's Day activities. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#37:1> Comments from evaluation sheets prove that the goals of the

program are right on target.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#38:1> In their evaluations the older adults say: * It was not as difficult

as they thought it would be.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#39:1> * They didn't expect it to be as easy as the children made it for

them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#40:1> * They liked the hands-on experience ( making something as opposed to

observing).
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#41:1> * They found a new friend and were pleased with their " teacher 's"

enthusiasm. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#42:1> Many of the older adults offer to volunteer in the school

computer lab. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#43:1> The students say: * They like teaching people instead of having

people teach them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#44:1> * " All old people are smarter than you think.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#45:1> " * They like the additional opportunity to work with computers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#46:1> * They like making new friends with an older person. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#47:1> Now that these older adults are computer literate, they are

purchasing their own computers, getting jobs using computers, requesting and

receiving computer donations for their own senior center lab, developing

follow-up word processing classes at their own center and returning to the

schools to volunteer as a lab assistant in the school computer lab .
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#48:1> It 's a win-win- program for all. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#49:1> Computer Ease in Upper Arlington is inexpensive--we use existing

equipment and staff located in the adjacent Tremont Elementary School.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#50:1> To develop a similar program in your location you should consider the

equipment and staff available, existing software and proximity between

student and older adult groups.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#51:1> Then take the Computer Ease idea, combine it with resources available

in your community, and help more older adults become computer literate. </p>

<ICE-USA:W2B-033#53:2> <h> Conspicuous Consumer</h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#54:2> <h> By Deborah Branscum</h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#55:2> <h> Saints and Sinners Revisited</h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#56:2> <h> The third annual roundup of nice--and naughtycompanies</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#57:2> Yes, it 's time again to review the Macintosh scene and evaluate

industry saints and sinners.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#58:2> This year, as usual, consumers coped with uneven treatment in the

areas of quality, service, and support.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#59:2> Which companies are basking in the glow of good deeds done and have

earned a halo?<ICE-USA:W2B-033#> Which have shown the more devilish bent illustrated by

horns?
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#60:2> Keep reading to find out.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#61:2> ( Listings are in alphabetical order.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#62:2> ) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#63:2> Adobe Systems, Kensington Microware, and Microsoft Corporation

all earned halos with their exemplary records of being responsive to the

reader complaints that MacWorld forwards.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#64:2> ( By the way, when I praise companies for being responsive to

complaints, that doesn't necessarily mean that the customers are always

satisfied with the outcome.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#65:2> It does mean, though, that each company has been thoughtful,

communicative, and polite in addressing customers' concerns. ) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#66:2> Information service American Online rates horns for a billing

problem that began last August and still existed in November.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#67:2> Some Macintosh user find themselves being charged for time spent in

free areas.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#68:2> Moreover, 9600-bps access still isn't available to the masses.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#69:2> ( One nice move-AOL promises there will be no extra charge for

9600-bps service, once it arrives.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#70:2> It 's been a year of great change for Apple and its customers, as

Michael Spindler took charge, the company downsized, John Sculley left, and

Macintosh model after Macintosh model was rolled out the door.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#71:2> As usual, Apple 's has been both a saint and a sinner.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#72:2> Its heavenly practices include continuing to drop prices on its

computers, making them truly competitive with Intel-based machines.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#73:2> Apple also introduced the first desktop computer ( the Color Classic)

that meets the Environmental Protection Agency 's Green Star guidelines for

reduced power consumption ( the sleep mode cuts electricity use by half when

the machine is not in use).
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#74:2> And the Earth 's ozone layer is sure to be grateful that Apple dropped

its worldwide chlorofluorocarbon emissions from manufacturing to zero in 1993

from a peak of 270,000 pounds in l990. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#75:2> But Apple again showed its devilish side with inaccurate or

inadequate product specs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#76:2> Contrary to the Apple Catalog description and other product

literature, the Quadra 61O 8/16O does not include a math coprocessor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#77:2> And contrary to the box packaging and reassurances by some

salespeople, the Performa 475 does not use a standard O4O chip but the

68LCO4O instead.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#78:2> So it doesn't include a math coprocessor either ( but at least it

doesn't actually claim to), much to the disappointment of a few Macworld

readers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#79:2> Hello gray scale--it turns out the Quadra84OAV can't capture color

QuickTime video when used with monitors larger than 16 Inches--but dealers

don't know that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#80:2> Apple also discontinued its credit card program for purchasing Apple

products last August--without directly informing its customers outside

California that their cards were now worthless.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#81:2> Finally, the company 's track record for resolved customer complaints

is improving but not yet sterling.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#82:2> In some cases Apple requires people to sign away their legal rights

in order to get a settlement--and not necessarily a good one. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#83:2> Mail-order companies APS, MacDepot ( now part of MacMall),

MacWarehouse, and MacZone are saints in my book for responding promptly to

each reader complaint I bring to their attention. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#84:2> DayStar Digital earns a halo for a low-cost upgrade promotion and

horns for somewhat spotty execution of the offer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#85:2> In 1992, the company offered a

&dollar;99 upgrade to a 33MHz O4O board to Mac owners who bought by October 31 a 50

MHz 030 PowerCache accelerator that included a math coprocessor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#86:2> More than a year later, the promised 040 upgrade had not materialized

according to three customers who apparently fell through the cracks and were

getting restive about the wait.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#87:2> In its defense, DayStar points out that hundreds of customers have

upgraded successfully to the O4O board. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#88:2> Game company Graphic Simulations Corporation took a lot of time

to produce its second flight simulator, F/A-18 Hornet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#89:2> But in contrast to some others in the industry, GSC reportedly kept

its customers up-to-date on progress with the game.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#90:2> The company also actively recruited suggestions for improving the

game and then incorporated many of those suggestions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#91:2> Finally, the company maintains active and responsive online technical

support.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#92:2> So Graphic Simulations earned its halo for maintaining communications

with customers and providing consistent technical support. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#93:2> Bugs are an unfortunate fact of life for any computer Developer

but some bugs are more painful than others.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#94:2> Microtek Lab landed on the sinners list this year because of problems

with the ScanMaker II and the scanner 's accompanying Photoshop plug-in.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#95:2> The ScanMaker II comes set with SCSI ID 6; version 2.03 of Microtek 's

Photoshop plug-in could delete the contents of a hard drive if the drive also

used SCSI ID 6.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#96:2> Mirotek tried to fix the problem with version 2. 04 of its software.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#97:2> But 2.O4 sometimes writes to a removable disk drive as though it were

a scanner, erasing the disk.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#98:2> Ouch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#99:2> Version 2.05 fixes the problem, according to Microtek. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#100:2> Mirror wins both horns and halo.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#101:2> A halo because it bundles a full version of Adobe Photoshop with its

scanners, not a limited version like some other companies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#102:2> Horns because it ran two inaccurate advertisements early last year

that offered a lifetime warranty on its products.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#103:2> ( At the time Mirror believed it could work out a new warranty

agreement with its suppliers, which turned out to be incorrect.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#104:2> ) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#105:2> Pastel Development Corporation may have a winner in its DayMaker

3.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#106:2> 0, but some disgruntled customers report that during the many months

Pastel was working on version 3.0, the company was not responding to phone

calls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#107:2> One example is reader Randy Anderson.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#108:2> He prepaid for the upgrade to 3.0 in October 1992 and didn't get a

response to his letters or phone calls about his purchase between April and

late October, when 3. 0 finally landed in his mailbox. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#109:2> Quark 's policy that registered customers must pay the full fee

for replacement software and manuals should the software be lost in, for

example, a hurricane, doesn't really rate additional comment--just a pair of

horns. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#110:2> Shiva Corporation gets dinged for its failure to be responsive

online in its own forums on CompuServe and America Online for several months

in 1993.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#111:2> The good news is that the company hired an online support person who

made his debut in November, which should salvage the situation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#112:2> Last April a Georgia-based company called SofTeam promised to

offer great customer support for its dynamic- model spreadsheet called

Flippant, in the form of bug notification, free bug-fixes, and a monthly

newsletter.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#113:2> At the same time, the company was raising capital by selling

Flippant while the product was still under development.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#114:2> SofTeam gets both a halo and horns; the halo is for being more

honest than many companies in admitting its software isn't really there yet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#115:2> Raising capital by selling software still under development is novel

but not particularly customer-friendly, which is why the company--which I

haven't been able to locate--also deserves a set of horns. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#116:2> State of the Art alienated some customers this year after it

took over the Accountant Inc.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#117:2> line of products and declined to continue supporting customers who

did not upgrade to Accountant version 3. 5. 2.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#118:2> That 's a business decision the company felt justified in making.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#119:2> But a letter mailed out in July really ticked off some folks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#120:2> State of the Art explained that it made the decision not to support

older versions of the program " at the potential cost of customer goodwill,

corporate reputation, and future revenue," and later states " there will not

be any further individual responses concerning the issues addressed in this

letter.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#121:2> " State of Art earns its horns not for what it considered a

necessary business decision but for its not- very-businesslike communication

of that decision to its customers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#122:2> Virtus Corporation responded admirably to the approximately 700

customers who ordered copies of Virtual Sketch Pad for

&dollar;60. <ICE-USA:W2B-033#123:2> Because Virtual Sketch Pad became a different product ( Virtus

VR), the company mailed its customers Virtus WalkThrough, a

&dollar;195 program, for the same price.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#124:2> A fabulous gesture. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-033#125:2> Jim Warren, a columnist for computer tabloid MicroTimes, won his

halo by helping California residents win electronic access to much of the

information generated by the California legislature.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#126:2> Last spring Assembly member Debra Bowen introduced AB l624, which

was stymied by lack of support and legislators' concerns about cost.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#127:2> Warren rallied support for the bill and showed how low-cost access

could be provided via Internet--both crucial to the bill 's success.
<ICE-USA:W2B-033#128:2> Online access becomes available in early January 1994. </p> </I>
