<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#2:1> PCs, printers, smartphones, cameras, networks--your stuff will

inevitably stop working.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#3:1> Here 's how to troubleshoot and fix your most common tech issues.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#4:1> Your PC will crash, your camera will break, your network will fail,

and your printer will chew up paper.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#5:1> Before you spend valuable time and money waiting for tech support or

paying for a professional technician, read our handy guide to basic repairs

for your PC, home network, printer, digital camera, and smartphone.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#6:1> <h> How to Fix Your PC</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#7:1> Considering how many different software and hardware components

need to work correctly for a modern PC to turn on, it 's a small wonder that

they work as well as they do.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#8:1> We can't give you a panacea for all of your computer ills, but we can

provide a guide to getting out of the most common PC disasters.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#9:1> Here are some useful strategies. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#10:1> If your PC won't turn on: Try plugging it into a different outlet

or power strip; if it 's a laptop, try a different battery and power adapter,

if you have another one handy.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#11:1> For desktops, make sure that all your internal plugs and cards are

properly seated--graphics card, RAM, everything. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#12:1> If none of this helps, it 's probably a problem with your

motherboard or power supply, and unless you've got spare parts handy, you' 've

probably best 'ref calling the manufacturer 's tech support line. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#13:1> If your PC turns on, but won't successfully boot into Windows:

First, start booting up, and press F8 repeatedly during the boot process.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#14:1> This may allow you to access a menu that lets you select different

boot options with your keyboard, one of which is " Safe Mode".</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#15:1> Select Safe Mode, uninstall the last thing you installed, update

all your drivers ( if you need to download new ones, you may need to select

the " Safe Mode With Networking" option instead), and open up the System

Restore app ( Start Menu, Accessories, System Tools, System Restore) to roll

back to an earlier point when your PC could successfully start up. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#16:1> Safe Mode not working?
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#17:1> Your hard drive might be failing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#18:1> Get your rescue drive or manufacturer recovery discs, boot up from

it, and save whatever data you haven't backed up. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#19:1> Then run your disk diagnostic app--you can always run Check Disk,

which is built into Windows, by right-clicking your hard drive, selecting

Properties, clicking the Tools tab and selecting Check now... under the "

Error Checking" tab.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#20:1> There 's no cure for bad sectors--you'll have to re 'llce the drive.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#21:1> If you hear your PC emitting a set of beeps during the startup

process, it 's most likely your BIOS trying to tell you that you have a

motherboard-level problem with your PC--your processor fan might be

unplugged, for example, or your power supply might not be working. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#22:1> The beep patterns aren't standard, so you'll have to g 'llon a

different PC and check out your BIOS manufacturer 's Web site to figure out

what 's wrong. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#23:1> If Windows successfully boots, then crashes soon afterwards:

Start by updating all your drivers--first, the essential drivers provided by

your PC manufacturer, then the drivers for your peripherals and extra

devices.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#24:1> Don't forget to update your BIOS, too. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#25:1> If your PC is crashing soon after startup, try uninstalling

anything you recently downloaded and checking your startup apps and

background processes to see if something is going wrong. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#26:1> You can view the processes in the Task Manager by pressing

Ctrl-Shift-Esc and clicking the Processes tab--and you can use

ProcessLibrary.com as a reference for figuring out the obscure ones.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#27:1> For startup items, search for msconfig and click on the Startup tab

to see what 's going on.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#28:1> If something you recently installed shows up in there, it might be

your culprit. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#29:1> If your crashes aren't so easy to reproduce, try running a scan

for viruses and malware with your preferred security suite. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#30:1> On the other hand, if you recently installed a new security suite

and started seeing problems, try uninstalling it and then use a different

one.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#31:1> Security apps typically get deeper into the guts of your system than

other apps, meaning they're more pro 'reto incompatibilities. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#32:1> Still can't figure it out?
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#33:1> Google can be your best friend when it comes to troubleshooting,

especially if you have an error message handy--even if the official support

sites haven't covered your specific problem, odds are that someone has posted

on a tech forum about it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#34:1> Search for the specific error message--in quotes--for best

results, and if you can't find an immediately obvious error message, try

looking in Control Panel, Problem Reports and Solutions ( Vista); or, for

Windows 7, open Control Panel, Action Center, Maintenance, View reliability

history, and click on View all problem reports at the bottom of the window.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#35:1> If you can't find any leads, you might have to do a clean Windows

reinstall.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#36:1> Back up your data, reformat, and install from scratch.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#37:1> For more troubleshooting tips, check out our " Top Free

Troubleshooting Tools for Windows." </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#38:1> <h> How To Fix Your Network</h> Troubleshooting networking and

Internet-related problems can be tricky and time-consuming, especially if

your ISP is prone to network outages.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#39:1> Read on for some quick networking fixes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#40:1> If you can't find your shared PCs or devices on your local

network: There are several reasons why you might not be able to see a certain

PC on your network, but checking your firewall, your sharing, and your

workgroup settings should be a good place to start.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#41:1> For more details, check out " How to Troubleshoot Your Home Network."

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#42:1> Networks with Macs and PCs, or PCs running different versions of

Windows ( or Linux builds), have their own difficulties--features such as

Windows 7 's HomeGroups, for example, make networking much easier among

Windows 7 PCs but are not quite as easy for other OSs to play along with.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#43:1> If you can't update all your PCs to run the same version of

Windows, read " Set Up Your Home Network: Windows 7 Edition" to see how you

can get Windows 7 to play nicely with your network. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#44:1> If none of your PCs can access the Internet: Turn off your modem

and router, and then turn them back on.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#45:1> If that doesn't work, try plugging your PC directly into the modem

via ethernet. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#46:1> If it doesn't work, either, you may have a router problem.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#47:1> If not, your connection is down, and you probably need to call your

ISP 's tech support line. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#48:1> If only some of the computers on your network can access the

Internet: You're dealin 'reith an issue on your network, and the connection to

your ISP is working fine. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#49:1> First, open the command line ( Start Menu, Accessories, Run, then

type in cmd); type in ipconfig / renew.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#50:1> This will tell your PC to get a new IP address, a step that can clear

up several network issues. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#51:1> If that doesn't work, try checking the networking settings on

each of your PCs by going to Control Panel, Network and Sharing Center,

Change Adapter Settings and opening up the panel for the networking device (

Local Area Connection for wired networks, or Wireless Network Connection for

Wi-Fi, usually) that you're trying 're use, and click Details. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#52:1> From here, you should find clues to what might be going on.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#53:1> If it says " No" under " DHCP Enabled," then your PC is trying to use

a preexisting IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server information to connect

to your network.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#54:1> Normally, most home networks use DHCP ( Dynamic Host Configuration

Protocol) to automatically assign addresses to new PCs on the network, so all

you have to do is plug in ( or connect via Wi-Fi), and you're good t 'reo.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#55:1> Close the Details window and click Properties; click Internet

Protocol Version 4 ( TCP/IPv4), then Properties.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#56:1> From here, just switch the radio buttons from " Use the following IP

address" and " Use the following DNS server addresses" to " Obtain an IP

address automatically" and " Obtain DNS server address automatically." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#57:1> If your IPv4 address starts with " 169.254.", your PC is trying

to use DHCP to get an IP address and Domain Name Server information for that

network automatically.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#58:1> However, an IP address starting with those two numbers means either

that the DHCP server on the network ( typically the router, in small home

networks) isn't working, or that it 's not enabled, and you'll nee 'llo

manually enter the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server information on

your own. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#59:1> You can do this by going into the Network Connections window,

right-clicking on the network interface you're tryi 'reto use, and selecting

Properties. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#60:1> From here, you should select Internet Protocol Version 4 (

TCP/IPv4); click Properties, and then both the Use the following IP address

radio button and the Use the following DNS server addresses radio button to

enter them in.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#61:1> However, you'll pro 'llly need to get that information from whoever

set up your home network; most home networks use DHCP to cut down the hassle.

<ICE-USA:W2D-018#62:1> <h> How To Fix Your Printer</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#63:1> Printers can break, jam, and drop print quality suddenly.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#64:1> Here 's what you can do about these common printing headaches.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#65:1> If your printer jams: You're go 're to need to get that paper out of

your printer before you do anything else.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#66:1> It pays to check your printer 's documentation to make sure you

extricate the paper in a way that does not damage your printer 's internal

mechanics. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#67:1> Specifically, check the manual for advice on how to get to where

the paper is stuck ( an access door or release lever), and how to remove the

sheet--ideally, in one piece, as removing smaller bits can be a real pain.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#68:1> If you can't find your manual, the basic rule of thumb is to pull

gently on the paper in the direction that it would be exiting--i.e., forward,

not backward, in the paper path.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#69:1> If you can't get the whole piece of paper, look carefully for the

stray scraps and extract them with tweezers, as they could cause another jam.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#70:1> When it comes to paper jams, they're 'reier to prevent than to

fix.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#71:1> Start by taking good care of your paper--make sure it is stored

smooth, dry, and flat.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#72:1> Do not feed folded, dogeared, torn, or otherwise less-than-perfect

paper into your printer. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#73:1> Also, don't let paper sit for more than a day in vertical-feed

trays, as the pages can bend slightly ( affecting their ability to feed

smoothly) and the pressure of the paper on the rollers might affect the

rollers' functionality. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#74:1> Finally, adjust your paper tray to fit the paper you're 'reng.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#75:1> A carelessly set width or length guide can affect how the paper feeds

and possibly cause a jam.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#76:1> Also, most printers these days have their own maintenance functions

that will realign and clean the printer heads.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#77:1> Run through those once or twice and see if that helps.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#78:1> If your printer is printing slowly: A handful of different factors

could be slowing down your print speed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#79:1> Here 's what to look for. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#80:1> First off, check to make sure you're 'ret printing in a

high-quality or " best" mode, which will take longer than a default or draft

mode.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#81:1> Depending on what you're 'reinting, your connection to your printer

might be bottlenecking the print rate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#82:1> Wireless connections can be affected by distance from the printer,

airwave interference, and physical barriers, and USB connections have

narrower bandwidth than ethernet connections. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#83:1> If you print run-of-the mill documents, largely text and some

photos, than a wireless or USB connection should be adequate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#84:1> If you print complex or high-res graphics or have a lot of people

trying to use the printer, ethernet is better suited for bigger or busier

traffic.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#85:1> Also, most consumer printers rely on your PC to process the print

job, so if your PC 's memory and processor are already heavily taxed your jobs

will take longer to process. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#86:1> If a printer does have its own memory ( usually one designed to

work in an office), check to make sure there is enough memory to handle the

complexity and quantity of jobs you are sending to it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#87:1> Did problems begin after you started to print a lot more than usual?
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#88:1> Check the printer 's monthly duty cycle to see how much it 's designed

to push out. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-018#89:1> If you started off with a consumer-level printer designed to

print perhaps up to a few dozen pages a day, but you are now printing a

hundred or more pages a day, your old printer is probably struggling to keep

up.
<ICE-USA:W2D-018#90:1> If you are printing 25 percent or more of the monthly duty cycle

spec, then you should probably get a printer with a higher monthly duty

cycle.</p> </I>
