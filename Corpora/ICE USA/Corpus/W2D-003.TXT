<ICE-USA:W2D-003#1:1> <h> Paternity Guide for Unmarried Parents</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#2:1> A child born to unmarried parents does not automatically have a

legal father.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#3:1> Legal fatherhood can mean a lot to your child and to you as parents.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#4:1> Children with two parents involved in their lives are more likely to

succeed in a variety of ways.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#5:1> This pamphlet will tell you how you can make this important commitment

to your child and where to get help doing it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#6:1> Why is it important to establish paternity?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#7:1> * Identity: When parents establish paternity for a child, they

both say " Yes, this is my child." This gives a child a sense of identity and

connection with both sides of the family.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#8:1> Knowing both parents can improve a child 's chance of success in life.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#9:1> * Health: More and more, medical research shows how important it

is to know about any diseases or physical problems or characteristics that

may have been passed down from both sides of someone 's family.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#10:1> Knowledge of both parents' family medical history will help doctors

treat - or even prevent - medical problems that a child might have inherited.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#11:1> * Financial Support: Families with children who are supported by

two parents are more likely to have enough money to meet their needs than

families supported by only one parent.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#12:1> By establishing paternity, both parents make a commitment to support

their child to the best of their abilities. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#13:1> * Benefits: When parents establish paternity, they make their

child eligible for coverage under either parent 's health insurance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#14:1> If anything should happen to the father, the child may also be

entitled to receive Social Security, pension, veteran 's and inheritance

benefits. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#15:1> * Public Assistance: If a parent receives public assistance, he

or she is required to cooperate with the Child Support Enforcement Division

to establish paternity and a child support order.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#16:1> If the parent does not cooperate, his or her benefits may be reduced.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#17:1> How do I establish paternity for my child?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#18:1> Parents who are not married to each other can establish paternity

- legal fatherhood - for their child only if both parents sign a paternity

acknowledgment form or if either of them asks a court to establish

paternity.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#19:1> <h> Signing a Paternity Acknowledgment Form: The Easy Way To

Establish Paternity For Your Child</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#20:1> Parents can establish paternity for their child by signing a form

called the Voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#21:1> ( This is sometimes called acknowledging paternity.) Once both

parents have signed this form and their signatures have been notarized, the

man becomes the legal father of the child and his name goes on the child 's

birth certificate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#22:1> No one has to go to court. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#23:1> Parents can acknowledge paternity this way in three places:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#24:1> * The hospital: Parents can complete the Voluntary Acknowledgment

of Parentage form shortly after the birth of their child, while the mother

and child are still in the hospital.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#25:1> The birth registrar at the hospital can help with this.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#26:1> There is no fee when the parents sign the acknowledgment in the

hospital. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#27:1> * City or Town Clerk 's Office: If parents do not establish

paternity before they leave the hospital, they can still acknowledge

paternity for their child by completing a Voluntary Acknowledgment of

Parentage form and filing it at the city or town clerk 's office in the

community where the child was born.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#28:1> Both parents' signatures must be notarized, which the city or town

clerk can do.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#29:1> The clerk may charge a fee for filing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#30:1> * Registry of Vital Records and Statistics: If it is not

convenient to complete a Voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage form in the

community where the child was born, the parents may complete the form at the

Registry of Vital Records and Statistics ( RVRS), or mail the form with a

check for

&dollar;25 to RVRS. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#31:1> Parents can acknowledge paternity for their child any time in the

child 's life. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#32:1> <h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#33:1> Undoing a Paternity Acknowledgment</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#34:1> Legal fatherhood for the child is established as of the date both

parents sign the acknowledgment form, if it is properly completed and

filed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#35:1> If, within 60 days of the date both parents signed, either parent

comes to believe that the man named on the form may not be the father, one of

the parents must file a case in Probate and Family Court and ask the court to "

rescind" the acknowledgment ( that is, have it declared null and void). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#36:1> If, within 60 days of signing, the parent questioning paternity

is a party to a court hearing about the child ( for instance, to establish a

child support order or a custody and visitation order), the parent must raise

the issue of the child 's paternity at the hearing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#37:1> Before the end of the 60 day period, the parent questioning paternity

must file a case in Probate and Family Court asking to rescind the

acknowledgment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#38:1> After 60 days, the acknowledgment is as binding as a court

judgment of paternity and has the same legal force and effect.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#39:1> However, parents can challenge the acknowledgment, but only in court,

only within one year of the date both parents sign, and only on limited

grounds of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#40:1> The court will generally order the parents and child to undergo

paternity tests that determine whether the man is the biological father of

the child by comparing certain genetic characteristics that show up in blood

or tissue samples from the child and both parents.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#41:1> These samples are obtained either by a simple blood draw or by

rubbing a cotton swab on the inside of the cheek. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#42:1> If there are any questions about who a child 's biological father

really is, a parent should ask a judge or the Child Support Enforcement

Division of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for paternity tests

before signing an acknowledgment form. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#43:1> <h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#44:1> Going To Court To Establish Paternity: A More Complicated Way To

Establish Paternity For Your Child</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#45:1> Another way to establish paternity is for either parent, their

child, or us - the Child Support Enforcement Division - to start a court

action to establish paternity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#46:1> As part of this court action, the judge may order the mother, the

man who may be the father, and the child to have paternity tests.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#47:1> These tests are generally quick and easy.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#48:1> After reviewing the test results and any other relevant information,

the judge will decide whether or not the man is the father of the child.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#49:1> If the judge determines that he is the child 's biological father,

this will establish paternity for the child and the father 's name will go on

the child 's birth certificate.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#50:1> At any time during the court process, parents can sign a

Voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage form, and there will no longer be a

need for a judge to determine paternity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#51:1> These tests are extremely accurate in showing whether or not a

man is the biological father of a child.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#52:1> Who pays for the paternity tests?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#53:1> If the tests show that the man is the child 's biological father,

he pays for the tests.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#54:1> If the tests show he is not the father and we ( the Child Support

Enforcement Division) are providing services to the family, then we pay the

cost.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#55:1> How does someone get services from the Child Support Enforcement

Division?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#56:1> The Child Support Enforcement Division of the Massachusetts

Department of Revenue can assist parents in establishing paternity and child

support orders, collecting child support for the families it serves and

asking courts to adjust child support orders when circumstances change.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#57:1> Any parent or guardian of a child under 18 years old can ask for our

help with a child support order or with establishing paternity by calling our

toll-free Customer Service Bureau at 1-800-332-2733.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#58:1> If a parent receives public assistance, he or she can talk to a

caseworker at the Department of Transitional Assistance about the services we

provide.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#59:1> Applications for our services are also available on-line by visiting

our Internet homepage at www.state.ma.us/cse.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#60:1> A parent does not have to be on public assistance for us to help.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#61:1> It does not cost any money to apply for child support services from

us.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#62:1> When a parent applies for our services, we will do our best to help

that parent establish paternity for their child and get the support to which

he or she is entitled.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#63:1> Whether we succeed depends upon how much information the parent gives

us, how up-to-date and accurate it is, and what financial resources are

available to support the child once we locate the other parent.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#64:1> What if the parents are already living together and are both

supporting their child?
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#65:1> Do they really need to establish paternity?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#66:1> Yes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#67:1> Until they legally establish paternity, their child has no legal

father, even if both parents are living with the child.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#68:1> Things may change.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#69:1> A parent may not always be around or feel the same way about helping

out.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#70:1> When they establish paternity, parents ensure their child 's rights to

certain benefits that are available only if paternity has been legally

established.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#71:1> Will the child 's birth certificate include the father 's name?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#72:1> The birth certificate will include the father 's name if the

parents acknowledge paternity by signing a Voluntary Acknowledgment of

Paternity form in the hospital or later at a city or town clerk 's office or

at the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics, or a judge establishes

paternity in court and orders that the father 's name be included on the birth

certificate. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#73:1> Otherwise, the space for the father 's name will be left blank on

the child 's birth certificate.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#74:1> For some children born before 1994, the father 's name is already

on the birth certificate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#75:1> Doesn't that child already have a legal father?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#76:1> Before 1994, the father 's name would appear on a child 's birth

certificate if both parents completed an affidavit in the hospital swearing

that he was the child 's father, but this did not establish legal fatherhood.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#77:1> The father 's name may be on the birth certificate, but that child is

not yet entitled to all the benefits of legal fatherhood unless the parents

have been to court since then to establish paternity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#78:1> If parents of a child born before 1994 want to establish legal

fatherhood now, they can still do so, either by completing a Voluntary

Acknowledgment of Parentage form at the city or town clerk 's office or at the

Registry of Vital Records and Statistics, or by going to court.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#79:1> Will the child have the father 's last name?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#80:1> Generally, the mother can decide what the child 's name will be.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#81:1> Parents can choose their child 's first and last name together when

they fill out the birth certificate and acknowledge paternity for their child

in the hospital.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#82:1> They will have to go to court if they later decide to change their

child 's name.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#83:1> How long after a child is born can someone establish paternity

for that child?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#84:1> Paternity can be established at any time in a child 's life.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#85:1> Parents can establish paternity for an older child by completing an

acknowledgment form and filing it at the city or town clerk 's office in the

community where the child was born or at the Registry of Vital Records and

Statistics, or by going to court. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#86:1> What if the parent who is living with the child is not sure where

the other parent is?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-003#87:1> The Child Support Enforcement Division will try to locate the

other parent if the parent living with the child ( known as the custodial

parent) applies for our services or receives public assistance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-003#88:1> A custodial parent must give us as much information as possible about

the other parent - for example, full name, Social Security number, date of

birth, address, telephone number, the name and address of his or her

employer, the names of his or her parents, or information about his or her

motor vehicle ( the manufacturer, model or license number).</p> </I>
