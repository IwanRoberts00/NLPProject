<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#4:1> After fumbling the future,Xerox PARC is back with a visionary new

director, bright researchers, and amazing new technology. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#5:1> In 1983, I read an article about mind-amplifying machines.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#6:1> These were as different from the computers of the time as television

was from 15th century printing presses.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#7:1> The article 's author, Alan Kay, worked at Xerox Palo Alto Research

Center ( PARC).
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#8:1> I concluded that PARC amounted to a hive of zealots bent on changing

the course of culture.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#9:1> I wanted in on it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#10:1> Most of all, I wanted to test drive one of the devices they used to

amplify their own minds. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#11:1> I managed to get a job at PARC writing articles for a Xerox

in-house magazine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#12:1> A year before the first Macintosh computer was sold, I commuted 45

minutes to PARC 's rural campus to type on an Alto - the first true personal

computer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#13:1> My job was to interview PARC researchers about their work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#14:1> They talked about bit-mapped screens, local-area networks,

point-and-click interfaces, object-oriented languages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#15:1> All those futuristic experiments they showed me have diffused so

widely ( and profitably) during the past ten years that it is easy to forget

they were once confined to that building on a oak-spotted hill above Silicon

Valley. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#16:1> The players on the all-virtuoso team that convened then at PARC 's

computer labs were eager to volunteer as guinea pigs for the technology they

wanted to build.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#17:1> They were dedicated to designing their own personal, networked mind-

amplifiers, then handing over their creations to non-programmers for

intellectual work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#18:1> One phrase became PARC 's hallmark: " The easiest way to predict the

future is to invent it."
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#19:1> They succeeded so well that nothing has been the same since,

including PARC. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#20:1> The early days of PARC are the stuff of Silicon Valley folklore.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#21:1> Personal computers did not spring naturally from the computer

industry.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#22:1> They were deliberately realized by a radical fringe, against all the

force of the day 's accepted wisdom. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#23:1> These zealous wizards handed Xerox an astounding lead in

information technology in the early 1980s, but by the end of the decade,

Xerox watched as upstarts like Apple and Microsoft grew wealthy off Xerox 's

discoveries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#24:1> Neither Apple nor Microsoft even existed when the first Altos were

designed in the early 1970s; by 1990 either company could have bought Xerox.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#25:1> The tragicomic Xerox saga is recorded in Douglas K. Smith and Robert

C. Alexander 's Fumbling the Future.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#26:1> But Xerox hasn't always fumbled the future.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#27:1> The company persists because long ago it redefined itself and

reinvented its business.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#28:1> Fifty years ago, Chester Carlson invented a scheme for printing dry

photocopies of documents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#29:1> Few corporations of the day were interested in an expensive, messy,

unreliable way to do what carbon paper did cheaply and well.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#30:1> Nonetheless, Carlson 's company, Haloid, committed itself to a future

in which people would use office copiers for purposes unimaginable in the

carbon-paper era.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#31:1> Renaming itself Xerox, the company championed the copiers that soon

rendered carbon-paper obsolete. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#32:1> Having already invented the future twice, then squandering its

advantage, could Xerox still have stories to tell? In the fall of 1993, I

returned to Xerox PARC for another chance to go back to the future.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#33:1> Where was Xerox? On the road to reinventing itself for the third

time. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#34:1> New, young faces populate the halls today.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#35:1> Video windows and audio communications are built into workstations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#36:1> Desktop screens have evolved into wall-sized screens, clipboard-size

screens, and pocket-size " tabs." The place is still an intellectual

wonderland.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#37:1> Again I feel like I've dropped in on 've outpost from the future.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#38:1> It 's not just the latest gadgetry.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#39:1> Something 's happening.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#40:1> The hardware and software shops are still cooking up new goodies, but

now anthropologists and sociologists study the nature of knowledge work and

the way organizations function.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#41:1> These scientists are as important at PARC today as are inventors of

thin-film displays or engineers of RISC processors. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#42:1> In the 1970s and 1980s everybody at PARC shared a mental model of

the future - they predicted that millions of people would soon use screens

and windows and mice, linked to high-speed communication pipelines.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#43:1> But now in the 1990s, nothing seems as easy to forecast or design as

personal computing and networking were.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#44:1> This time, the folks at PARC are taking their info-tools into

relatively uncharted territory - what happens among people. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#45:1> Personal computers and local-area-networks are boxes of

electronics, cables that transport bits.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#46:1> But once they are in place, the effects on organization are more

powerful than number-crunching and file-transferring: People use those boxes

and cables to think, communicate, and solve problems in new ways.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#47:1> Those new ways are not visible, but they represent the raison d'etre

of innovative information processing and communicating tools.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#48:1> These tools, after all, don't generate electrical power or material

goods.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#49:1> Through the interaction of minds, they effect changes in human

relationships, and through those, changes in organizations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#50:1> This territory - what happens to people 's minds and to organizations

after personal computers and networks are installed - is the new terra

incognita that PARC researchers are exploring.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#51:1> What they have discovered so far, in the earliest phases of the

research, is both startling and inspiring. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#52:1> <h> Postmodern Computing </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#53:1> The first person at PARC I talked to this time around was Mark

Weiser.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#54:1> I had never met this smiling, bearded fellow before, but I recognized

the room he was standing in.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#55:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#56:1> I sat on the same couch in the same corner office with the same

view of Palo Alto ten years earlier when Bob Taylor was director of PARC 's

computer science lab.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#57:1> At that time, as now, PARC was a one-stop shop for everything from

new microcircuits ( and new ways of making microcircuits) to new computer

systems and new software.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#58:1> Taylor had been a young administrator who led a stellar,

single-minded team for more than a decade, with legendary results.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#59:1> Taylor and his crew were the heirs to Douglas Engelbart 's crusade to

" augment human intellect" at the Stanford Research Institute. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#60:1> As silly as it seems today, there was a time when almost

everybody in the computer industry was convinced that computers were destined

solely for calculation or data processing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#61:1> Engelbart, a lonely visionary, pushed the radical idea that computers

could be used to extend the power of human minds to think, communicate, and

solve problems - this was " augmentation." There was a threshold out there,

Taylor 's early PARC team believed, measured in processing power, where true

intellectual augmentation would take place - the way 24-frames-a-second marks

the boundary between still photography and cinema. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#62:1> Bob Taylor 's motto had been " Build what you use.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#63:1> Use what you build." One of the first things Mark Weiser shared was

his own interpretation of this now hoary PARC wisdom: " You let what you

build change you, and you move on." In Weiser 's view, PARC learns how to

build better tools, and then everybody learns to use them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#64:1> Then they do it all again, with the new tools.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#65:1> The people at PARC have a hunch that this organizational

bootstrapping might be worth more to Xerox than the tangible artifacts the

process produces. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#66:1> The early computer science lab crew stood on a mountain, and the

destination was clear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#67:1> The sights of Weiser and company are more arcane - they are mapping

aspects of intellectual work that have yet to be explored. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#68:1> Weiser wants computers to disappear into the background.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#69:1> When computers become invisible to users, the most important side of

human-computer symbiosis ( to humans) has a better chance to emerge.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#70:1> How to make them invisible? Make them ubiquitous. "
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#71:1> Ubicomp" Weiser calls it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#72:1> To Weiser, the intellectual origins of " Ubicomp" lie in the

social rather than the technical side of PARC 's research: " The idea of

ubiquitous computing first arose from contemplating the place of today 's

computer in actual activities of everyday life," he writes in a recent paper. "
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#73:1> In particular, anthropological studies of work life teach us that

people primarily work in a world of shared situations and unexamined

technological skills. However, the computer today is isolated from the

overall situation and fails to get out of the way of the work." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#74:1> In Weiser 's cosmology, the original " desktop" graphical user

interface does not go far enough to get out of the way of the user.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#75:1> Interfaces don't do the job.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#76:1> Neither do agents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#77:1> And certainly not virtual reality ( VR).
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#78:1> Weiser writes: " In its ultimate environment, VR causes the computer

to become effectively invisible by taking over the human sensory and affector

systems.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#79:1> VR is extremely useful in scientific visualization and entertainment,

and will be very significant for those niches.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#80:1> But as a tool for productively changing everyone 's relationship to

computation, it has two crucial flaws.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#81:1> First, at the present time [ 1992], and probably for decades, it

cannot produce a simulation of significant verisimilitude at reasonable cost.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#82:1> That means that users will not be fooled and the computer will not be

out of the way.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#83:1> Second, and most importantly, it has the goal of fooling the user -

of leaving the everyday physical world behind.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#84:1> This is at odds with the goal of better integrating the computer into

human activities, since humans are of and in the everyday world." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#85:1> Embedding intelligence in the environment is not possible with

present-day technology, so Weiser 's group started with wall-sized interactive

screens known as " boards," clipboard-sized terminals known as " pads," and

tiny computers called " tabs."
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#86:1> The first stages of Ubicomp bootstrapping incorporated another

innovation, first created by Olivetti 's research center in Cambridge, England

- an " active badge."
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#87:1> With an active badge system, every computer you sit down at is your

computer, with your custom interface and access to your files, because your

active badge sends it information via infrared signals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#88:1> It is possible to track the locations of other researchers at all

times by central monitoring of active badges - a handy tool with Orwellian

implications. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#89:1> In his office, Weiser drew a horizontal line.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#90:1> The far left side he labeled " atoms"; the far right side, "

cultures."
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#91:1> PARC, Weiser points out, directs research at every part of the

spectrum defined by the line between atoms and cultures: toward the " atom"

end of the line is PARC 's ongoing exploration of the nature of materials.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#92:1> Toward the center lies PARC 's work in turning materials into real

hardware products.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#93:1> Smack in the middle is the task tackled by Taylor and his group,

integrating hardware and software design into information systems.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#94:1> And toward the right, closer to " cultures," are systems and

practices - the hunting grounds of social scientists. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#95:1> The lab 's new direction, Weiser says, " recognizes even more that

people are social creatures."
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#96:1> He referred to his ideas as a form of " postmodern computing," in

that he wants to " return to letting things in the world be what they are,

instead of reducing them" to data or virtualizing them into illusions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#97:1> " Ubicomp honors the complexity of human relationships, the fact that

we have bodies, are mobile," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#98:1> Tabs, pads, boards, and badges are the first bootstrapping steps in

that direction, not the long-term goal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#99:1> Nevertheless, part of that environment has migrated into productland

and is embodied in the " LiveBoard" ( see WIRED 1.4, page 36).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#100:1> PARC teams are way beyond " fumbling the future."
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#101:1> They are inventing the future again.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#102:1> But this time they are reinventing their understanding of how to

invent the future, as well.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#103:1> There is a sense that they are onto something new, that instead of

extending the old computer revolution into new widgets and gadgets, they are

at the dawn of a whole new - and potentially scary - revolution.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#104:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#105:1> PARC is an intellectual playground, full of free spirits.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#106:1> How do they feel about the possibility that Ubicomp might lead

directly to a future of safe, efficient, soulless, and merciless universal

surveillance? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#107:1> " Some people refuse to wear badges," Weiser says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#108:1> " I support their right to dissent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#109:1> And one principle we go by here is to maintain individual control

over who else sees anything about us....The answer will have to be social as

well as technical." </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#110:1> <h> Corporations as MUDs: The Virtual Water Cooler </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-040#111:1> When computers disappear into the woodwork, people in

organizations will do the same important thing people in organizations have

always done: They will tell each other stories.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#112:1> While workstations can amplify the work people do in their physical

cubicles and formal job roles, boxes on desks can't approach what happens at

the water cooler.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#113:1> One PARC researcher, Pavel Curtis, is looking closely at MUDs, the

water coolers of the Internet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#114:1> He sees them as a way of bringing informal, even playful

communication back into organizations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-040#115:1> In MUDs, the " Multi-User Dungeons" of the Internet, thousands of

enthusiasts create their own dramatic adventures, sometimes vying for points

in fantasy games, sometimes just conversing. </p> </I>
