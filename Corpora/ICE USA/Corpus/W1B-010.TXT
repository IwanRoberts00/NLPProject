<ICE-USA:W1B-010#1:1> <h> Date: September 16, 1991</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#2:1> <h> Dear Clare,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#3:1> I just went out today to look for a birthday card from you, but I

was a little worried because I didn't know if you would still be at your old

address.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#4:1> Lo + behold, when I got home, there was a letter from you!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#5:1> Well, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#6:1> Now you are as old as I am again.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#7:1> It 's kind of difficult to find nice birthday cards-- I just don't

like looking through all the mushy cards with rhymes inside.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#8:1> I liked this one, though.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#9:1> It reminded me of Nora, too.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#10:1> Did you visit her on your way home?
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#11:1> How was she? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#12:1> Congratulations on your job!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#13:1> I think it was Ashley who said, when I told her you might be working

in North Dakota, " North Dakota 's far away from everything!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#14:1> It 's even far from South Dakota!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#15:1> " But there should be lots to do, ( concerts, lectures, people, etc.)

at a university ( it is a college or university, right? ) .
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#16:1> I hope it goes well! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#17:1> Ashley had an interview with WWF for the year long position, but

I haven't heard whether they have officially offered her the position or

whether she accepted.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#18:1> She isn't too happy about staying in D.C. and says she wishes she

knew someone who wanted to move to Wash. ( state.)
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#19:1> Why she wants to move so far away, I really don't know.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#20:1> But she is more likely to accept the WWF job since they told her it

was okay if she only wants to work there until next June.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#21:1> She says she really doesn't want to spend next summer in D.C.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#22:1> Our beach trip was fine.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#23:1> We stayed in a motel apartment with Ashley 's parents, right on the

beach.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#24:1> I was very lazy + just read + slept.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#25:1> I think I was still tired because I had been sick.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#26:1> Remember my bladder infection ( which I'm paranoid I haven' 'mgotten

rid of.)?
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#27:1> It turns out I had a severe allergic reaction to the antibiotic I had

started taking the Thursday before I went to Boston.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#28:1> On the way home, my back ached so much I could barely stand it, + I

let Larna drive the last 45 minutes home.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#29:1> On Tuesday on the way home I also developed a rash.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#30:1> I couldn't eat much of anything all week + lost 6 pounds ( which are

back now).
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#31:1> For a couple days, I was congested + had a runny nose + fever.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#32:1> Then my joints all ached so much that I couldn't sleep + my gums

swelled!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#33:1> All in all it 's a good thing I went home when I did.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#34:1> Our doctor even made a house call, but I'm fine now.
<ICE- 'mA:W1B-010#35:1> I was very disappointed that I wasn't able to stay on Tuesday, but I

guess we got to talk a lot on Monday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#36:1> Well, I'd better get a 'dob with benefits-- health insurance SOON.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#37:1> Ashley said, " Clare, it 's really stupid not to have insurance." Gee,

I think I KNOW that.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#38:1> Her parents are paying for her insurance, though, + she doesn't have

loans to pay back.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#39:1> Actually, I shouldn't complain because my parents are paying my

loans.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#40:1> Oh-- Ted called me while I was in Bethany Beach-- he got the

phone number from my parents!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#41:1> He said he was sorry for not letting me know that he couldn't come to

Boston, but he had been very busy, + he said he would call me at home to talk

at greater length.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#42:1> He has moved again, so I don't have his current address or phone

number.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#43:1> Maybe I am starting to drag myself out of my rut.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#44:1> For 2 Sundays in a row, I have looked through the Post help wanted

ads-- all 36 or 38 pages of them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#45:1> It takes a few hours + I don't find too much.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#46:1> Actually, last week I only applied to one job because it took several

days for me to successfully produce a letter quality resume + letter.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#47:1> I finally gave up on my computer ( until I have more time) + used my

mom 's.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#48:1> This week there wasn't too much interesting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#49:1> I applied for 4 jobs locally, though, one as " technical asst." at

St. Mary 's College English dept.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#50:1> in the hopes of getting free tuition ( I'm still vaguel 'mconsidering

trying to get certified to teach H.S.) + the others with M.-type orgs.

director of in-home services to disabled, etc.)
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#51:1> My mother pointed out the local jobs, + the point is valid that if I

lived here for a year or so, I could save up some money.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#52:1> Ashley 's mother just read in the Post that Wash.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#53:1> is the 3rd most expensive city in which to live, as far as average

rent goes! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#54:1> Next I will try for jobs dealing w/ the USSR, but I'm not sure if 'm
I should phone the orgs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#55:1> first, or send a letter + resume + then phone.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#56:1> Things seem to be going downhill with Taylor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#57:1> He says I am stressful to deal with because I am moody + don't tell

him how I feel.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#58:1> It pisses me off that he says these things when he is still dragging

things out with Hannah.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#59:1> He told me to call him yesterday after I got home from work, so I

called him at 4 pm, 6 pm, + 10 pm.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#60:1> He never answered, + I'm pretty sure 'me was talking to Hannah the

last time because the phone rang + rang-- + he has an answering machine +

call waiting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#61:1> If he 's on the phone with someone, the machine doesn't pick up, but

you get a ringing tone because of the call waiting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#62:1> I guess instead of breaking off suddenly, like with Nick, this

relationship is going to drag on as it gradually gets worse + I get more +

more irritated.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#63:1> But it 's really hard to break it off when I basically have no other

life-- no friends I see regularly, + no interesting job.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#64:1> Saturday, my parents, Taylor, + I went sailing with my aunt +

uncle.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#65:1> T. was annoyed because I didn't talk much - - but during the 1st half

of the trip I was nauseated until I threw up, after which I was extremely

tired because of the Dramamine I took.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#66:1> He isn't very sympathetic.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#67:1> You may wonder what I find so attractive about this man.!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#68:1> I have no good response at the moment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#69:1> Ashley + I haven't talked any more specifically about moving in

together in D.C. since her lease goes until the end of October + she hasn't

even officially accepted a job in D.C.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#70:1> I wonder if she has had a depressing year-- I don't think she sees

friends very often + didn't seem too happy with her job-- but she doesn't

talk much about it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#71:1> Thanks for the Oberlin sticker.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#72:1> Let me know as soon as you get a new address + phone number.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#73:1> And have a great birthday! </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#74:1> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#75:1> <h> November 29, 1991</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#76:1> <h> Dear Clare,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#77:1> What a nostalgic feeling to be writing on loose leaf!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#78:1> I don't think I've done th 'vesince college.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#79:1> How was your Thanksgiving?
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#80:1> I assume your family all got together in Olean.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#81:1> As soon as I saw this NY'er cover, I decided to send it to you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#82:1> I always think of you when I see Roz Chast cartoons! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#83:1> I worked 11/2 hours on Thanksgiving-- we have to work all

holidays ( including Christmas + New Year 's), or they say they will fire us.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#84:1> I didn't really mind, though, since I got off at 5:30 pm, + my family

always eats around then or later.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#85:1> Also, the money I made, made up partly for how slow the restaurant 's

been the past 2 weeks.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#86:1> About 450 people came to eat Thanksgiving dinner.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#87:1> All the employees of the restaurant kept saying how they would eat at

home if they could, + they couldn't believe how many people would WANT to eat

out.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#88:1> I had one woman who ordered raw oysters + a crab cake-- she said

that 's what she was thankful for.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#89:1> Yuck!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#90:1> Not a day at work goes by that something doesn't piss me off.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#91:1> For example, 3 servers had to be at work ( me included) at 6:30 AM.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#92:1> We didn't even have any customers until 7:30 or 8 AM, so we sat

around talking to some of the kitchen workers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#93:1> Then " Chef Chad" came out + told us either to clock out or help him

in the kitchen.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#94:1> I asked if we could clock in at

&dollar;4.25, since waitresses only get

&dollar;2.28. <ICE-USA:W1B-010#95:1> He said no.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#96:1> The restaurant wasn't even paying us extra for working on a holiday!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#97:1> This guy Chad is really slimy, though.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#98:1> He once asked where I went to school, + I said " Oberlin," with that

omnipresent qualifier, " in Ohio." He said, " Oh, were you datin' a guy from

Eaton?
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#99:1> " I said, " huh?
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#100:1> " He said, " or were you eatin' a guy from Dayton?
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#101:1> " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#102:1> Enough of that.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#103:1> I would have walked out of that restaurant yesterday because I was

so angry, but I didn't want to give up my health insurance.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#104:1> I figured out that, before I got my insurance, I had spent

&dollar;1000 in medical bills, mostly because of the drug reaction I had.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#105:1> I don't think my problems have completely cleared up yet, either.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#106:1> At least now I don't have to worry about expensive tests, + if

anything horrible happens, my parents won't lose our house to help me.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#107:1> Taylor was in Arizona the week before last, + for some reason, I

finally decided to break up with him.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#108:1> When he came back on Friday he called, but I wasn't home.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#109:1> I didn't call him back until Sunday, + that evening I went over to

his house with any empty bag to collect all my stuff.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#110:1> " Did you come here to tell me you don't want to see me anymore? "

he asked, making it easier to leave.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#111:1> Now it 's Friday, + I don't feel that upset.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#112:1> I can't believe I'm not 'ming to see him again-- it feels like he 's

just away on travel still.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#113:1> I asked if he wanted to talk about it or if he just wanted me to

leave, + he said he would think about it this week + call me later.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#114:1> I'm afr 'md I will see him again, + the whole stressful thing will

just resume.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#115:1> But 2 ways REALLY to turn me off FOR GOOD would be if he said he

didn't want to see me again or if he got back together with Hannah, even

temporarilly.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#116:1> He didn't argue with me at all, so maybe I really WON'T see him

again.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#117:1> It just seems so sad, right before Thanksgiving, Christmas, + his

birthday, which is Dec. 24.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#118:1> I had several things I wanted to give him.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#119:1> Also, he gave me a really nice pair of earrings from Arizona-- the

only thing he 's ever given me, besides the rose + that ugly shirt!
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#120:1> Maybe I should have waited for an occasion when I was mad at him to

try to break up.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-010#121:1> I just got a nice letter from Wally.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#122:1> I hadn't written him for months + finally sent him a Halloween card

as a belated B-day card.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#123:1> He 's a great letter-writer-- I guess he has a lot of sympathy for

people who are depressed about their jobs or relationships.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#124:1> He sounds like he has a pretty good, though challenging, job now,

after being out of work for 2 month.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#125:1> Both my parents are now looking for new jobs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#126:1> My dad is now on " idle time"-- he 's getting paid + must go to work,

although they have no assignments for him.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#127:1> My mother is more serious about job-hunting, + said that if she

finds something in D.C. she would share an apartment in D.C. with me until my

dad sold our house.
<ICE-USA:W1B-010#128:1> This plan sounds distant + unlikely, but I guess it 's a possible way

of moving to D.C. I bought the new " What Color Is Your Parachute," + now

that I suppose I 'll have more free time, I 'll do the exercises in the book

that are supposed to help one find a career. </p> </I>
