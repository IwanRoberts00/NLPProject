<ICE-USA:W2C-019#1:1> <h> Prices were mostly higher at the close on the Chicago Board of

Trade. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#2:1> Corn was boosted by forecasts for rain that could hamper the

harvest and possibly lead to stalk rot.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#3:1> Many producers have given priority to harvesting soybeans to allow

corn to dry in the field.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#4:1> Soybeans staged a slight rally to close with fractional gains.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#5:1> November beans, however, remain just a few cents from last season 's

low of

&dollar;6.04 per bushel posted Monday.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#6:1> Late pressure was tied to commercial selling.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#7:1> Early support came from private crop forecasts trimming USDA

estimates.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#8:1> Wheat closed near session highs on scattered commercial and

commission house buying.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#9:1> Trading was light and limited to a narrow range.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#10:1> Corn was up 1 , soybeans were off to up 1, wheat was off 1 to up

3 and oats were unchanged.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#11:1> Cash prices pushed live cattle futures sharply lower and live hog

futures were lower at the close on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#12:1> Cattle futures selling was linked to lower wholesale beef prices,

with packers offering discounts on a wide variety of beef cuts to boost

sales. Reports indicated Southern Plains fed cattle prices topped out at 50

cents to

&dollar;1 lower at

&dollar;71 to

&dollar;71.50.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#13:1> Steep cash advances Monday and Tuesday coupled with rain forecast

for Thursday spurred producers to market hogs again and the increased

marketings were expected to pressure hog prices further Thursday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#14:1> A controversial plan that would allow so-called ' 'piggyback''

options trading in the agricultural futures pits is under consideration at

the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#15:1> Corn traders voted 2-1 last week in favor of the proposal but

soybean and wheat traders have indicated opposition to the measure.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#16:1> CBOT Chairman Patrick Arbor said he is in favor of the proposal

as a way of increasing trading opportunities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#17:1> Some full members, however, said they fear allowing options

trading in the futures pits would have an adverse impact on the value of

their memberships.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#18:1> The last time a membership changed hands it sold for

&dollar;429, 000, compared with options memberships, which normally sell for about

&dollar;42,000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#19:1> The options pits currently are separated from the futures pits by

walkways.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#20:1> The MidAmerica Commodity Exchange is moving its rough rice

futures and options contracts to a larger pit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#21:1> The markets will move to the northeast corner of the Chicago

Board of Trade agricultural trading floor, to a spot formerly occupied by

Major Market Index stock index futures.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#22:1> Rice prices are at their highest levels in more than one year and

trading interest has soared since Japan agreed to accept imports.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#23:1> The MidAm is the only exchange in the world currently handling

rice contracts.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#24:1> Fresh-frozen green soybean pods from a new specialty variety

developed by University of Nebraska-Lincoln researchers are bound for Japan

and if they pass muster, a new international specialty market might

emerge.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#25:1> The pods are called edamame ( eh-DAH'-mah-may).
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#26:1> The Japanese boil the pods in salt water and snack on them with beer

or tea, shelling the beans from the pod much like Americans shell peanuts.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#27:1> The Chinese cook shelled beans and mix them with other foods for

added protein.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#28:1> Edamame soybeans look like other varieties in the field.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#29:1> They are harvested in the pod while still green instead of at

maturity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#30:1> Japanese farmers grow edamame and its premium price spurs some

greenhouse production but demand outstrips production.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#31:1> Japan imports frozen podded beans to satisfy its year-round appetite

for the sweet, nutty-flavored snack.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#32:1> Taiwan and China supply most of Japan 's frozen edamame beans but

some Nebraskans think the state 's growers and food processors could enter

this Market with high quality beans being developed at UNL.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#33:1> Japan is the world 's largest consumer of soybeans for food,

buying 49 million bushels in 1991.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#34:1> The U.S. agricultural attache in Sao Paolo, Brazil, says the

South American nation likely will harvest 23 million tons of soybeans this

season.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#35:1> The report says Brazil harvested 22.3 million tons last year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#36:1> The increase reflects the better financial shape of farmers as a

result of higher soybean prices in the past two years and good export

prospects.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#37:1> University of Nebraska experts are reminding farmers to give

their combines extra attention before harvest.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#38:1> Agriculture machinery specialist Robert Grisso recommends

combines be cleaned, either by using air or a high pressure washer, to

prevent insects, disease and spoiled grain from ending up in the bins and

spreading a possible insect infestation to the next crop.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#39:1> Grisso said before starting up the engine, farmers should make

sure to check all fluids, including the radiator coolant, oil and hydraulic

fluids.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#40:1> Tire pressure is another important factor.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#41:1> Grisso said that the correct air pressure can redistribute the weight

of the combine to reduce the effects of soil compaction.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-019#42:2> <h> White House backs California 's tax on multinationals</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#43:2> The U.S. adminstration sided with California Thursday in the

state 's legal battle over the way it taxes multinational companies, but not

before California made a significant concession.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#44:2> Governor Pete Wilson signed into law Wednesday legislation that

removes the hefty annual fee a multinational company must pay if it wants to

get ' 'water 's edge'' treatment in taxation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#45:2> In separate appeals, Barclays Bank of London and

Colgate-Palmolive Co. of the United States ( and on a narrower basis, AlCan

of Canada) are trying to recover some back taxes levied by California 's

Franchise Tax Board - - taxes the companies say were levied through an unfair

formula.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#46:2> Barclays' appeal of lower court rulings is now before the U.S.

Supreme Court.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#47:2> Most of the industrial world has filed friend of the court briefs in

support of the banking giant.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#48:2> Last year, the administration under President George Bush filed a

brief in support as well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#49:2> But new U.S. Solicitor General Drew Days III filed a brief for

California that asks for the appeal to be denied, especially in light of

California 's repeal of its ' 'water 's edge'' fee.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#50:2> Still at issue would be the hundreds of millions of dollars in

back taxes levied on Barclays under California 's old ' 'worldwide combined

reporting'' method of taxing internationals that the corporation seeks to

reclaim.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#51:2> The complicated case involves three distinct methods of taxing

foreign multinationals:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#52:2> - - ' 'World combined reporting,'' used by California before

1986, and under which Barclays and others hope to get back what they call

unfair taxes;</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#53:2> - - ' 'Arms length,'' which the United States and other

individual states use;</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#54:2> - - ' 'Water 's edge,'' which California offered as an alternative

to ' 'world combined reporting'' after 1986, but which multinationals had to

lock into after paying an annual fee.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#55:2> Barclay 's Supreme Court challenge to California 's pre-1986 system

was filed before January 1992.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#56:2> Colgate 's separate appeal petition and a friend of the court brief in

the Barclay case were filed this summer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#57:2> Barclay 's appeal of a California Supreme Court ruling concerns

past taxes on the bank 's state subsidiary, Barcal, and Barcal 's immediate

parent corporation, Barclay Bank International ( BBI).
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#58:2> Barcal, or Barclays Bank of California, has since been sold to Wells

Fargo & Co.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#59:2> Barclays says BBI and its subsidiary should have been taxed under

the so-called ' 'arm 's length method'' of reporting income.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#60:2> Under ' 'arm 's length,'' where a corporation crosses national

boundaries, a state taxes any corporation - - even a wholly owned subsidiary

of a foreign corporation - - as an independent entity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#61:2> The subsidiary is required to pay taxes only for the income its

shows on its own books.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#62:2> But until 1986, California required ' 'worldwide combined

reporting.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#63:2> ' 'That means income was reported by adding up the income of all the

entities that make up a business - - including parent corporations and

susidiaries.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#64:2> California then figured out the state 's share of income by

formula - - using a ratio of state to worldwide property, payroll and sales.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#65:2> Barclays says that figure can be substantially higher than under the ' 'arm 's

length method'' and was unconstitutionally applied.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#66:2> The state 's ' 'worldwide combined reporting'' method has been

upheld by the California state Supreme Court.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#67:2> Until last month, California offered an alternative to ' 'worldwide

combined reporting'' - - the so-called ' 'water 's edge'' method.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#68:2> With the payment of an upfront and sometimes hefty fee, a

multinational could restrict the combined reporting method to the United

States.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#69:2> Ben Miller, counsel for multistate taxation for the California

Franchise Tax Board, told United Press International earlier that if the

state loses the Barclays case before the U.S. Supreme Court, it would have to

pay the multinational about

&dollar;535 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#70:2> If rulings in the California courts are upheld, or the appeal is

simply not heard, Barclays will owe the state about

&dollar;330 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#71:2> But Miller said the ' 'domino effect of ( a 'dadverse) Barclays

decision'' to California could reach

&dollar;1.3 billion in the Colgate and AlCan cases.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#72:2> Besides, he said, those figures are based on the case as of March 31,

and the final price tag may be higher.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#73:2> Filing friend of the court briefs for Barclays before the U.S.

Supreme Court were Britain, all the members of the European Community, and

Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#74:2> The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a friend of the court brief

for Colgate-Palmolive.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-019#75:2> Thursday 's friend of the court brief filed in support of

California by the Clinton administration, in a reversal of Bush

administration policy, significantly strengthens the state 's position.
<ICE-USA:W2C-019#76:2> The Supreme Court historically has been reluctant to go against

government recommendations in tax cases, especially involving foreign

petitioners. </p>
