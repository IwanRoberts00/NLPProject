<ICE-USA:W1A-002#1:1> <h> A Cap in the Air</h>
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#2:1> <h> " He doesn't allow our dreams to exceed our ability to fulfill

them."</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-002#3:1> Row after row of black square caps stretch out before me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#4:1> I see anonymous backs of heads, knowing that in this crowd are those

whom I have come to love like family.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#5:1> The heavy air breathes the sighs of those who will enter and depart

from Diddle Arena for the last time.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#6:1> My attention slips from the monotonous drone of commencement and

meanders among old memories littering the passage to this day.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#7:1> It is memories that give such a public event as graduation its private

significance.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#8:1> I find my memories stacked in a forgotten corner of my mind.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#9:1> Dusty pictures from my past return in short bursts of insight, making

my eyes water as if at any second I might sneeze.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#10:1> I see myself four years earlier, a senior in highschool, driving the

country roads of my hometown.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#11:1> Every so often a miscellaneous bug would fly in, to be welcomed by

loud music, loud singing, and fresh air pouring in from the open windows.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#12:1> I believed, at the time, that there was no sweeter place on earth

than in my 77' Cutlass Supreme Oldsmobile, barreling down the road at 50

m/p/hr.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#13:1> The countryside couldn't be more beautiful, the car couldn't have

more character, my future couldn't be more certain.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#14:1> As a senior in highschool, my dreams included completing a bachelor 's

degree at Western, earning a Ph. D.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#15:1> at Vanderbilt in clinical psychology, getting married to my

boyfriend, completely refurbishing the Oldsmobile into mint condition, and

having two kids, all by the time I became 27.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#16:1> The only part of that dream that still remains is the part about the

Cutlass.</p>

<p> As I approach the completion of my college degree, I realize that my

dreams have undergone a metamorphosis.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#17:1> I no longer want to be a clinical psychologist; I haven't seen that

same boyfriend for over two years; I certainly don't want to go to

Vanderbilt; I wonder sometimes if I will ever have children.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#18:1> ( I do assume children will enter the picture at sometime, but it may

or may not be by the time I'm 27.)
<ICE- 'mA:W1A-002#19:1> The future holds no promises.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#20:1> I shiver at the magnitude of this thought, knowing that despite my

current plans ( to enter graduate school as soon as possible), anything can,

and probably will, happen.</p>

<p> Somewhere in the confusion of our futures lies our perfect selves,

crafted lovingly by the master 's hands.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#21:1> In highschool I was so sure of my future; I was certain that God

would also agree with my big plans.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#22:1> I guess those plans got lost in the debris of all those things God

stripped from me so that I might become His more perfect creation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#23:1> I have always heard that the changes God makes are like a refiner 's

fire, constantly purging a precious metal of all impurities, until all else

is gone but that which is purely precious.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#24:1> Instead of one dream, many stretch before me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#25:1> I am certain one of them was planted there by God.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#26:1> It is waiting dormant, until God 's time, when it will spring forth to

be nurtured by my love and devotion, already rooted in the love and devotion

of a gracious Father.</p>

<p> Last night I dreamed that I was flying airplanes and teaching others to

jump out of them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#27:1> And in that dream, I vaguely remember myself jumping, floating

through the air steadily approaching the ground, my hand tightly clutching a

parachute string, my insides filled with exhilaration.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#28:1> Once more in the airplane I am laughing and crying.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#29:1> My friend is there, nervous but excited about learning to jump.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#30:1> My mentor is there, erasing my uncertainty with her smile.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#31:1> That is where my dreams are.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#32:1> In the clouds.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#33:1> Basking in the sun.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#34:1> Freely communing with all winged creatures.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#35:1> God promised His eye is on the sparrow; His eye is also on my

dream.</p>

<p> The monotonous drone has ceased.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#36:1> The last name has been called.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#37:1> At the conclusion of the Alma Mater, I and my black, capped friends,

in one sweeping movement, remove the jaunty squares resting precariously on

our heads.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#38:1> In a moment they dance in the air.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#39:1> I see mine.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#40:1> As it peaks it 's crown tumbles downward.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#41:1> Into my waiting hands all my dreams pour out.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#42:2> <h> I KNOW THE WORDS BY HEART</h>
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#43:2> <h> Like apples of gold in silver settings, is a Word spoken in the

right circumstances.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#44:2> Proverbs 16:11</h>

<p> It is Sunday.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#45:2> I am in church surrounded by Words.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#46:2> But, they are good Words, full of love and graceful forgiveness.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#47:2> And then it happens, coming without warning or announcement.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#48:2> I see her and the sight preaches louder than any preacher could.</p>

<p> The little girl is about five years old.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#49:2> She is caught in the web of her father 's arms, sweetly trapped and

seeking no escape.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#50:2> There is such a look of peace and contentment on her face.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#51:2> She is nearing sleep with her nose in the creases of his neck.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#52:2> I know she can smell and feel him.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#53:2> Feel the rough scratchiness of his hurried Sunday morning shave and

smell the birthday cologne, he splashed on this morning.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#54:2> I know by the gentle whispers that he is telling her Words, three

precious Words.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#55:2> I am there with her, wishing to have been her.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#56:2> I am jealous.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#57:2> I know it is her time with her father and somehow I am intruding upon

them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#58:2> I never had those sort of times; they were times that were never to

have been mine.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#59:2> I still want them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#60:2> But, I have given up looking for that which can never be found.</p>

<p> The family that I was born into was cold.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#61:2> Not the bitter, biting cold of the North, but the nippy, nervous cold

that troubles the South.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#62:2> The kind that makes you draw clothes and feelings more closely about

you.</p>

<p> My father was a college educated man who lived in the world of books and

Words.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#63:2> It was a good life.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#64:2> My mother never finished elementary school.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#65:2> She lived in the world of my father.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#66:2> It was not a good life.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#67:2> Where my father had romance, adventure and contentment between the

pages of his books; my mother found drudgery, tears and resentment between

the pages of her life.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#68:2> He had all that he wanted.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#69:2> She had nothing that she needed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#70:2> Into this patch of cold, dry Words I came, ready and willing as a

sponge to soak up the love and attention that I needed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#71:2> It did not take long to discover that this was a dead and unfruitful

place, full of empty Words.</p>

<p> Words can be magical and mystical.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#72:2> They are more powerful than can be imagined.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#73:2> They are death and life, written in ink on paper.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#74:2> Just think of it, Words can kill and heal, fix and tear down.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#75:2> They can bring joy or absolute sadness.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#76:2> They can control or set us free.</p>

<p> It was a world of Words that I received from my father.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#77:2> The harsh, loud, authoritarian Words of a dictionary, so unlike the

honey-soft and slow Words of my mother.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#78:2> Truly from my father though I only asked for three Words.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#79:2> Only three Words, out of the millions that I heard him speak.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#80:2> Only three, was that so much to ask for?
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#81:2> But, out of his wealth of Words, he could not give me these, I love

you.</p>

<p> Now the pages of his book have ended; his Words have ceased to be.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#82:2> I will never hear them from him.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#83:2> He has been gone almost ten years now, but the indelible mark of that

loss is there.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#84:2> It is like a dead body that needs to be buried but I can't find the

proper grave.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#85:2> Before he died, I had the chance to give to him the Words he never

gave to me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#86:2> Words that before, I had only been able to write quickly in casual

letters.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#87:2> I had never been able to say them either.</p>

<p> My last chance came as it always does on that clarion call known as the

deathbed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#88:2> He was not fully conscious.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#89:2> His life was slipping away as fast as my heart was beating.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#90:2> This was the moment to break the bond of Words that held me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#91:2> I could tell him the magic Words and stop the evil legacy.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#92:2> I could tell him, Daddy, I love you.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#93:2> Dying, he could not respond with embarrassment or anger.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#94:2> He would be too weak to fight and kill my magical life-giving Words.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#95:2> Holding his hand, I said, " Daddy, I..................It was too

late.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#96:2> He was already gone.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#97:2> I hope there are books and Words in heaven.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#98:3> <h> Some Decent Proposals</h>

<p> I'd l 'de to live in a simple world without the silly daily stresses.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#99:3> I have a few ideas that would make America a cleaner, quieter, and

less irritating place to inhabit.</p>

<p> Take the checkbook for example.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#100:3> Its sly--devious, does anyone really understand how to balance it?
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#101:3> I propose every person on the planet be issued a money card.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#102:3> This money card would replace the need for currency, checks, credit

cards, etc.</p>

<p> On payday, our bosses would simply transfer money from the corporate

money card to the employee money card by computer.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#103:3> It would be used like a credit card.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#104:3> Retailers would run it through the money card scanner and the

purchase price would be deducted from our individual account.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#105:3> There would be no waiting for checks to clear, no need to balance

the checkbook, no need to worry about where to put loose change--life 's

frustrations solved!</p>

<p> My second idea is a much simpler one.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#106:3> Rude motorists have always driven me crazy.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#107:3> For example, when I'm crui 'mng down the bypass from campus going

to--let 's say--the mall, I get into the right hand lane ( the turning on red

lane) to get on Scottsville.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#108:3> And there I sit.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#109:3> In my rearview mirror I see a trail of impatient, flashing turn

signals.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#110:3> In front of me there is one driver who decides that switching to the

left lane is too inconvenient, therefore constraining the rest of us to wait

for the green.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#111:3> I propose we pass a law changing all right hand lanes to turning

lanes only--at least the ones leading to Scottsville road.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#112:3> It would save time, fuel, and frustration.</p>

<p> Another of my proposal could save fuel as well.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#113:3> I have a plan that could revolutionize lawn-mowing as we know it.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#114:3> Imagine a world where we aren't awakened on Saturday mornings by the

atrocious buzz of the old snapper mower.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#115:3> That buzz would be replaced by a metal track, about an inch wide,

laid on bordering sides of the property.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#116:3> A low power laser could then be placed on the track to slide slides

along and slice all the grass in its pathway.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#117:3> No need for noise, smoking engines, or manual labor, and everybody

gets to sleep in on Saturdays!</P>

<p> It 's obvious I've 'veways enjoyed thinking about new inventions, but at

the same time, I can't help but laugh at some of the foolish creations in

existence.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#118:3> Take the " Flow-Bee" hair cutting device fro, er, I mean for

instance.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#119:3> I've 'veen the contraption on TV many times, and I wander how much

the models are paid to pretend they love their newly butchered hair.</p>

<p> Since we'r 'ren the subject of appliances, lets take a peek into that

refrigerator.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#120:3> Go on now, don't be afraid it won't hurt you--well, just don't eat

that fuzzy, green gravy left over from Thanksgiving and you' 'llbe OK.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#121:3> But seriously, the chore of cleaning out the fridge is so tedious.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#122:3> I propose we design a self-cleaning ice-box.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#123:3> I haven't ironed out the details on this one yet, but it

necessitates small animals who can read the date on the milk jug.</p>

<p> About the date on that milk jug, when it says " Sell by January 12" does

it mean it 's safe to drink still, or it should be thrown away.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#124:3> What is this vague statement?
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#125:3> Some sick joke between milk persons I guess.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#126:3> I propose we put a label on the jug that says this product is no

longer safe for human consumption after January 12."
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#127:3> That is much more clear.</p>

<p> These are only a few of my proposals.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#128:3> They may not be earth-shattering.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#129:3> They may not solve world hunger.
<ICE-USA:W1A-002#130:3> They may not be as revolutionary as the " Clapper," but at least

they don't suck like the Flow-Bee.</p> </I>
