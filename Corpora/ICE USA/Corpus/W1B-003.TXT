<ICE-USA:W1B-003#1:1> <h> February 19, 1990</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#2:1> <h> Dear<@> Mike</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#3:1> Well, believe it or not, I have made up my mind about what I will

be doing next year ( and I need to tell so many people that I have to write a

form letter).
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#4:1> I am going to volunteer full-time for a year ( June 1990-June 1991) at

the Harambee Christian Family Center in Northwest Pasadena, California.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#5:1> Northwest Pasadena is not an inner-city community, but it has most of

the problems that city ghettoes have: poverty, crime, drug and alcohol

addiction, underachievement, and so on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#6:1> The founders of Harambee, <@> Jasper</@> and <@> Mary Parker</@>, have

claimed a ten-block area of Northwest Pasadena as theirs and are determined

to bring these problems to an end.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#7:1> ( of course, after those ten blocks are revitalized, there 's no

stopping them from expanding. . . . )
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#8:1> In the eight years they have been there, there has already been

visible change in the community.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#9:1> Just one example is that one of the three houses owned by the Center

used to belong to one of the biggest drug traders in Pasadena, and he is now

in jail and drug deals are no longer done on the 1500 block of Navarro

Avenue. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#10:1> You are probably thinking that reclaiming a ghetto community is a

rather ambitious project; how has Harambee been doing this?
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#11:1> <@> Susan Pickles</@>, a present staff member at Harambee, wrote a

good capsule summary: " Our goal is to live among the people, feel their

needs and make their needs our needs, work with the community to meet the

basic needs of dignity and hope, and then make young people the leaders of

their own community."
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#12:1> Essentially, the staff at Harambee are trying to change the community

by bringing the message of Christ into it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#13:1> By this I mean that the primary problem of the people living in these

communities is that society tells them in too many ways to catalog that they

are worthless and have no chance of amounting to anything.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#14:1> Contrary to society, the message of Christ is that all persons are

precious in God 's sight.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#15:1> The staff thus seeks to first and foremost communicate to the people

of the community that they are people with worth, by showing them in both

intangible and practical ways that we care about them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#16:1> ( Yes, it 's weird to write " we" when speaking of the Harambee

staff--but exciting as well!) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#17:1> The foremost practical way of showing that we care about the

people of the community is in the youth program, which provides everything

from a summer day camp for the kids in the area to tutoring and help with

homework during the school year, weekend hikes in the mountains, and

breakfast before church on Sunday mornings.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#18:1> Most of these kids have parents who show little if any concern for

them, who do not encourage them to have high hopes for what they can do with

their lives, and who certainly do not challenge them in their education.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#19:1> Harambee tries to provide these needs for the kids, primarily through

one-to- one relationships between the staff and the kids.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#20:1> I will be spending about half of my time working in this youth

program, tutoring, teaching arts and crafts, leading music, taking the

children hiking and camping, teaching a sort of weekday Sunday school, and so

on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#21:1> We hope that as we spend time with these kids, showing love for them

and holding out challenges to them, they will gain the self-esteem and dreams

needed for them to escape the traps of despair and addiction that society

offers them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#22:1> We also hope that they will be inspired to take responsibility to

help their community continue to overcome its problems and, as they grow up,

choose to stay in the community and use their capabilities and skills to help

it further change into a place of hope and life.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#23:1> I will also serve as a general assistant to the director of

Harambee, <@> Allen Pickles</@>.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#24:1> I will be doing some administration ( </@> Allen</@> is not a very

organized person and hopefully I can help get the program running more

smoothly) and some writing for their publications ( the founder, <@> Jasper

Parker</@>, was self-educated after third grade, and so when he writes, he

needs a lot of editorial help to communicate his very powerful ideas).
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#25:1> In addition, Harambee has programs in adult education, job training,

and job placement, and </@> Allen</@> is also thinking of trying to start a

coffeehouse to provide alternatives for entertainment in the area, so

depending on what evolves over next year, I could be involved with any or all

of those projects, planning or administering them or even working to

implement them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#26:1> I hope this has given you some idea of what I'll be doi 'llnext

year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#27:1> I am excited about being a part of Harambee; I think I will learn a

great deal about practical ways American Christians are working to help

troubled communities overcome their problems.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#28:1> I expect that God will stretch me in a lot of ways as I try to fit

into a lower-class, predominantly black and Hispanic community as a servant,

and I expect that I will learn a lot about life that I don't see as a white,

well- educated, upper-middle-class person.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#29:1> ( I am going to be raising my financial support and am aiming at

&dollar;300/month,

&dollar;250 of which will go to housing and food costs, so I will be having a new

economic experience.)
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#30:1> During the year I will also be thinking about whether I want to go on

to, graduate school in biophysics in 1991.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#31:1> I've applied t 've year and am planning to defer admission to

somewhere, probably but not definitely Harvard ( I have a little more

thinking to do before I settle on them).
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#32:1> However, I am not at all sure that I won't decide to continue in

Christian social service work, perhaps at Harambee, perhaps elsewhere, or go

on staff with Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship for a few years, or go to

seminary with an eye towards eventually teaching religious studies in a

seminary or a university. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#33:1> If you have further questions about what it is I'm up to, if
 'momething in this letter is unclear or if you simply want to know more, let

me know!
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#34:1> I'm trying to ke 'm this letter under two pages, and I figure not

everyone will want to know all the imaginable details about Harambee--but I'm

always ha 'my to tell more.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#35:1> ( You may have to wait until spring break to hear, though, depending

on how my thesis goes.) </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#36:1> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#37:1> <h> <@> Sarah</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#38:1> <h> Dear <@> Mark</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#39:1> Well, what can I say about my first five days here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#40:1> There 's been a mixture of exasperation and joy that I didn't really

anticipate, but I'm not sure wh 'mI didn't expect it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#41:1> To begin with, the joys.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#42:1> My roommate, <@> Lisa Simpson</@>, is wonderful.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#43:1> She is black, from the West Side of L.A., and would have grown up in

an environment just like the kids here in NW Pasadena had it not been for an

aunt who took her in as a little kid.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#44:1> As it stands, she is about to be a senior at Tarkio College in

Missouri, a double major in religious studies and sociology.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#45:1> What 's neat is that she 's considering grad school, and is also very

interested in working in Christian community development.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#46:1> She also loves to sing, and she and I have been going walking in the

mornings ( 6:15 a.m., bright &early! ) .
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#47:1> So, we're get 'reg along really well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#48:1> I don't want to take the time to go into all the other folks who are

here who are just super, but I'm expectin 'mto end the summer with close

friends. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#49:1> Another thing that has been really fun has been planning for the

first week with the kids here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#50:1> I think that the summer program is really well set up.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#51:1> It 's not S.R.A. Summer Club ( for those of you that don't know,

that 's the ultra-organized day camp I worked for for four years ( how d'you

like that alliteration?) in Sw'more), b 'mause the kids are really different

and their needs are equally different--poor black kids instead of rich white

suburban kids--but it 's going to be great.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#52:1> Planning the science lessons has been so much fun.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#53:1> I'm co-te 'mhing second grade with a woman from Kenya who has been at

Harambee for about three months ( she 's five or six years older than I am) .
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#54:1> This woman, <@> Anjta</@>, is going to be a fantastic sister in

Christ and a great partner.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#55:1> Her faith is astounding to me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#56:1> Some day she plans to go back to Kenya to do something on the lines

of Harambee in the ( many) poor areas there, but for now she is following the

call of God in America.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#57:1> Anyway, next week we're 'reing rocks & minerals, which I was nuts

about when I was a kid, and it 's so much fun to go back to all the things I

learned when I was in elementary school--the Moh hardness scale, fossils, &c.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#58:1> We'r 'reoing to make plaster-of-Paris fossils, and <@> Anjta</@> and I

are going to illustrate the layered structure of the earth with a model made

out of ice cream ( to be eaten later by the kids, of course), among many

other things. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#59:1> Also, I met <@> David Bowie?s</@> friend <@> Stanley Marberry</@>

who is temporarily working at World Christian Magazine and attending Fuller

Seminary.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#60:1> He invited me over for dinner and we ended up talking until about

9:00 p.m.--I really enjoyed his company.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#61:1> We talked about all kinds of things.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#62:1> It was a welcome moment of intellectual dialogue ( not to put down

Harambee-- the people there are really smart, but the conversations centered

95&percent; of the time around the work to be done!).
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#63:1> Finally, there have been a lot of wonderful moments of discussion

about Christ and Christianity, of prayer, and of worship.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#64:1> I won't describe them all right now, because it would take up a lot

of space and time, but this is a place of good fellowship.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#65:1> The most powerful things of the week include a conversation I had

with <@> Jared Byrd</@> ( one of the other interns) and <@> Sing Chuen</@> (

one of the full-time staff who is leaving after this summer) last night about

the role of spiritual warfare and the importance of prayer in trying to

battle drugs, the primary enemy here in NW Pasadena.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#66:1> It made me really think hard about how seriously I take prayer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#67:1> As Sharon said, working here gives you better reason to pray than

you'v 'vever had before--people 's lives are at stake, and you often feel

awfully helpless--and yet at the same time often the time to pray is sorely

lacking because there 's so much to do.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#68:1> Please pray for me that I could keep the covenant I 've made with God

to be faithful in prayer this summer ahead of everything else. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-003#69:1> The other food for thought and prayer highlight was the

devotional teaching given to us by Dr. <@> Pickles</2> this-morning on I John

3:11-24.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#70:1> He talked to us about Christian community, and he essentially said

that the most important part of the summer was our experience living together

in community.
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#71:1> For those of you who don't know, the nine interns, plus the two

single full-time staff ( <@> Sujin</@> and <@> Walter</@>), are all living

together in one house and are eating our meals together; the Parson family

are spread out over two other houses in the same complex which is centered

around the " ministry house" ( building where the meetings, day camp, &c. are

held) .
<ICE-USA:W1B-003#72:1> Thus, we are in close quarters together. </I>
