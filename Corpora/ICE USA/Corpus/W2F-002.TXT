<ICE-USA:W2F-002#2:1> <h> by Paul Rosenblatt</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#3:1> I took the wrong exit off the autostrada.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#4:1> I had gone too far.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#5:1> I had been waiting for the right one.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#6:1> I thought I could spot it by keeping my eye on the city in the

distance.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#7:1> I kept thinking this is not the exit, the next one, and the nest one

would not be it and so I went until I realized I was circling pretty far

north of Florence, certainly of the historic center, and so gazing for a

bright afternoon sun as if there were a direction to be found there, I turned

off at an exit under a high pale blue sky and the I saw above the city a

cloudy and faint white moon in the sunlit sky.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#8:1> I was somewhere on some outskirts but I managed to make my way back

thinking of where the Arno must be and then there I was in the heavy bumper

to bumper traffic of the Lung' Arno and I did not mind the traffic because it

felt good not to be alone. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#9:1> I enjoyed the movements of the crowds along the Arno and in the

stop and go traffic there was time to comfortably watch the stroll of women

in their Easter finery.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#10:1> There were more than a few in tights and jeans.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#11:1> Ah, the Arno, I thought, the fair river of Dante.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#12:1> Then I thought of the lines of the grand Tuscan to the college or

assembly of hypocrites, that I was born and grew up by the beautiful Arno, in

the great city.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#13:1> This I always liked when he next says and I said aloud, e son, col

corpo ch' i' ho sempre avuto.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#14:1> Now I said it aloud in English, I am in the body I have always had.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#15:1> Yes, I liked that, the hypocrites in a make believe that destroys the

soul, a world of deliberate make believe, and here 's Dante in the middle of

his life alive in the body that he has always had in the world of his make

believe, his divine poem. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#16:1> Well, that 's what came to me anyway as I passed the Ponte

S.Trinita and I realized I had daydreamed too far and I had to turn way back

into the neighborhood of the American Consolute on Lungarno Vespucci to find

may to Hertz.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#17:1> I parked the car and closed it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#18:1> I patted the right front fender.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#19:1> " Nice horsey," I said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#20:1> I had sure come to like that car.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#21:1> I took the keys and the papers and dropped them into the slot of the

drawn door shutter and I walked a bit with the strap of the overnight slung

over my shoulder when I spotted a taxi. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#22:1> <h> 4.HER HAND ON HIS ASS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#23:1> I had flown open the windows of my apartment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#24:1> It was spring in Florence.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#25:1> The street below was wholly domesticated this late Easter afternoon

with families and clans.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#26:1> Some were clearly returning from the Casnine with soccer balls and

balloons or from the Boboli gardens or some with enough flowers to open a

sidewalk stand or with casks of oil and wine from family gatherings in

country homes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#27:1> Some of the children were cranky, some wild, a few dazed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#28:1> One little boy was pissing on a post near the entranceway of an

apartment house while his family was carrying on a lively, animated

conversation with a group of friends in front of the building.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#29:1> I guess the poor kid couldn't wait until they were done talking which

he probably already knew would be forever.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#30:1> I felt for the kid.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#31:1> It was nice well-fed neighborhood. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#32:1> I was living on Via Arnolfo almost across the way from the corner

where Cimabue runs into it and only a long hemispheric block from the Ponte

S. Niccolo and the Hotel Mediterraneo and the only a few blocks from the

Piazza Beccaria and really no more than a twenty or twenty-five minutes by

foot from the historic center.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#33:1> Nice and well located.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#34:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#35:1> It had been a very cold winter.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#36:1> Water pipes had burst, the Arno had frozen over and a bunch of

laughing boys and girls had managed to drive a packed car onto the ice there

in the middle of the river, and old Neptune, the Great White Man of the

Fountain in the Piazza della Signoria, had icicles on his beard and

elsewhere.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#37:1> So did old Cosimo looking on from his horse and so did his horse.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#38:1> The truth is that winter I had a jock cup of icicles myself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#39:1> I had placed my hopes for the thaw in the woman who lived above me.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#40:1> I could hear her footsteps clicking through my apartment as if

she were in my apartment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#41:1> I could hear her going into the living room, the dining room, down

the corridor, into the kitchen, the bedroom.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#42:1> Wherever she went I could hear her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#43:1> She was caged animal in high heels on an Italian marble floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#44:1> There she was drawing the bath water, a fate, a destiny if I would

but seize it!
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#45:1> Dash up the stairs, I tell myself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#46:1> Ring the bell.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#47:1> She comes to the door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#48:1> She has had barely time to wrap the bath towel about her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#49:1> The conversation is always tentative and on her part a bit coy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#50:1> The closing line is always the same.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#51:1> I am saying to her, " Yes, I would love to take a bath!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#52:1> She was wonderful.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#53:1> I would say about twenty-two or three, and I was nel mezzo del

cammin, in the middle of my journey as the divine poem begins. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#54:1> She was tall enough, about five eight, two or three feet short of

the length of a tiger if you take away the tiger 's tail. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#55:1> She had blond hair streaked with a darker color or two that she

wore short and kind of punky, and she had blue eyes kind of almond shaped and

apple rosy cheeks and lips that you knew you had to touch lightly with your

fingers before you kissed them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#56:1> I couldn't figure out her nationality and so I decided she was

Lithuanian. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#57:1> Her nipples always seemed to be visible no matter what she was

wearing, a blouse or a sweater or pullover or dress, no matter the material.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#58:1> The form and shape of those nipples seemed to come through no matter

what.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#59:1> Those nipples would make a painter 's strawberry delight if she were

modeling in the nude.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#60:1> Her breasts were so beautifully shaped that she needed no bra and she

wore none.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#61:1> I know because I'v 'veeen her in a skimpy yellow tank top.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#62:1> She had a tight band of a waist and a fully pledged, marvelously

singing ass, a Hymn to Paradise.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#63:1> She had rich, strong thighs and legs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#64:1> I have seen her in white short shorts that carried a red Paris

signature on the hip and she always wore high heels.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#65:1> From time to time we would pass on the street and she would give me a

kind of half smile and I would feel the beginnings of a thaw from that frozen

state I have just spoken of to a liquid one. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#66:1> Although as luck would have it, for the six months that I had

been living there, we had never met in the vestibule or the elevator, no such

intimacies.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#67:1> I think I must have met all the neighbors- about twelve apartments in

the building, two on a floor- but never her in that small elevator or in the

vestibule.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#68:1> I had met her boyfriend in the elevator from time to time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#69:1> He was tall and handsome and charming and apparently well-heeled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#70:1> Once he was carrying flowers and wine once a large water color

landscape with a glass frame that was spidery shattered and he looked at me

and pointed to the glass and smiled and shrugged his shoulders hopelessly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#71:1> He always had a pleasantry either about the weather or the Viola

soccer team.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#72:1> They weren't doing too well.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#73:1> He was young and seemed to have it all. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#74:1> He was from Milan.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#75:1> I knew that from the license plate on his BMW, which was usually

parked at the entrance of the building.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#76:1> Parking on that street was just about impossible and how he always

seemed to find a parking space and one in front of the building, I' 'lldon't

know.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#77:1> There are mysteries to good fortune and they are finally not to be

looked into. </p> </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#78:1> I guess that he was from Milan was why he was not around very

much, just a weekend here or there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#79:1> Sometimes I would see them walking the street his arm about her

shoulder and she with her arm about his waist and sometimes her fingers

curled the edge of his front trouser pocket and sometimes the back trouser

pocket and sometimes she placed her hand on his ass. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#80:1> <h> 5. THE CLIMAX IN THE CHORUS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#81:1> I did not watch the replay of St. Peter 's.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#82:1> My appetite was large.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#83:1> I had missed the family day meal so I went along the Borgo degli

Albizzi and I found Vecchia Firenze open.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#84:1> I had a vegetable soup and the house penne and a veal chop and a

radicchio and french fries which I 've got to tell you were invented by the

Italians.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#85:1> I drank a red tavola with the meal and then I had an expresso.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#86:1> The Vecchia Firenze was jammed with tourists, two or three large

groups of senior high school college kids from the British Isles or Germany

or something, I can't tell what anymore and I couldn't grab the language in

the distant din, maybe it was Dutch or Frisian or something, or who knows but

they could have been from Denmark or Sweden, and so I named them, as usual,

Lithuanian. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#87:1> Where you came in the main entrance with the low arch, there was

one long table at the rear of this room and I was seated close by.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#88:1> This great wood table held a family group.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#89:1> There was a stately grandmother wearing a good many beautiful jewels.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#90:1> She was lean and even her wrinkles had a beauty to them and she was

sitting at the head of the table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#91:1> She sat very straight and never quite smiled but always seemed as if

she pleasantly were about to.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#92:1> She presided over that table like a grate and much beloved Queen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#93:1> She would nod her head up and down in assent to the talk that was not

merely going on about her but which was always finally addressed to her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#94:1> There were sons and daughter with their families at the table and it

looked about six grandchildren in all.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#95:1> Everyone seemed to be a good eater and they were having a great time

and I enjoyed being near by. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#96:1> I continued on up the street and joined the crowds on Via De'

Calzaiuoli.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#97:1> They were chiefly a younger generation going up and down and

flirting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#98:1> There was an open gelateria and I had a double scoop, huge, of

chocolate gelato.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#99:1> Then I felt the pang in my heart and the tremble in my knees and I

knew I was looking for the great love of my youth. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-002#100:1> There was no reason in the world why I should ever find her, let

alone in Florence, and there was no reason to look then and there, my heart

sorrowfully aching, but I get these damned moments and suddenly I am looking

and wherever I am or have been I look.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#101:1> That the soul for you.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#102:1> That what yearning does for the soul.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#103:1> You become haunted and spooky.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#104:1> You are alone and the silly dream persists even in the middle of the

journey when you should not only know better but do know better- no, not

something idealized and ennobling, a Beatrice or a Laura, but more like

Rogers and Hammerstein than Petrach or Dante, gross, as the kids in America

say, some kind of their musicals in America, a look across the crowded room

or is it the crowded sea and there she is, lutes and flutes, a slow motion

ballet, and I am eating chocolate and she is strawberry gelato.
<ICE-USA:W2F-002#105:1> What you end up with is the click of high heels on Italian marble,

the hollow hallway of reverberation. </p> </I>
