<ICE-USA:W2A-021#1:1> <h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#2:1> While incineration has been used to dispose of sewage sludge since

the 1930s, serious concern regarding environmental impact due to organic

emissions has developed only recently ( 1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#3:1> Results of field tests on systems in the United States have shown that

a number of toxic products of incomplete combustion ( PICs) may be emitted

from multiple-hearth and fluidized-bed units ( 2-10).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#4:1> Other studies have generated concern over the possible emissions of

polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans

( PCDFs) ( 2,3).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#5:1> Studies on multiple-hearth units in Canada have shown that some

materials may be rapidly vaporized on the upper hearths ( drying zone) and

swept from the unit before combustion temperatures are realized ( 11).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#6:1> A recent laboratory study has shown that sludge can exert a

stabilizing effect on some of the toxic industrial contaminants in sewage

sludge, retarding their destruction ( 12).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#7:1> In addition, this same study has shown that a number of toxic PICs may

be formed from degradation of the sludge biomass as well as the contaminants.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#8:1> This raises some concerns over the toxic organic emission from sewage

sludge incineration and suggest that a better understanding of the nature of

these emissions is necessary before adequate regulatory and control

strategies can be developed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#9:1> The University of Dayton participated in a study which compared

the results of bench-scale thermal decomposition testing of four sewage

sludge samples.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#10:1> These samples were also incinerated as part of a full-scale test

program conducted by Radian Corporation under U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency ( EPA) sponsorship ( 4-10).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#11:1> The primary goal of the study was to determine if laboratory test

results could be used to predict full-scale results, and if laboratory and

theoretical predictions could be used as part of a comprehensive organic

emissions risk assessment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#12:1> One fluidized-bed and three multiple-hearth facilities were examined.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#13:1> The key operating parameters for these facilities are summarized in

Table 1.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#14:1> <h> EXPERIMENTAL </h>
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#15:1> <h> Instrumentation </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#16:1> Thermal decomposition testing for all four sewage sludge samples

was conducted using the System for Thermal Diagnostic Studies ( STDS) ( 13).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#17:1> This high-temperature. gas-phase, flow reactor assembly permits study

of the thermal decomposition of gaseous, liquid, solid, or polymeric

substances under very precise, well-controlled conditions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#18:1> The STDS incorporates a bench-scale thermal decomposition unit

with an in- line analytical unit for product analysis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#19:1> The thermal unit includes a modular control console and a modified

HP5890 GC which houses the sample insertion region, a high-temperature

furnace, fused-silica reactor, and the associated transfer lines.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#20:1> The system is capable of temperatures up to 1200 C and gas- phase

reactor times, tr of 0.1-10.0 sec.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#21:1> The analytical unit of the STDS is comprised of another HP 5890 GC

which is coupled to a computer- controlled HP 5970B bench-top Mass Selective

Detector ( MSD) for product analysis.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#22:1> A DB-5, 30m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25-micron film thickness capillary

column ( J&W) was held at - 60 C to trap the reactor effluent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#23:1> The effluent was separated by programming the GC oven from - 60 C to

290 C using helium carrier gas.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#24:1> The MSD was operated in the full-scan ( 10-500 amu) or Selected Ion

Monitoring ( SIM) mode using electron impact ionization at 70 eV.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#25:1> Calibration of the MSD response for specific " target list" compounds

was accomplished using appropriate analytical standards.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#26:1> Upon receipt, the sludge samples from each site were frozen until

24 hours prior to use.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#27:1> For each experiment, approximately 5 mg of sludge was placed in a

quartz sample tube assembly located in the insertion region of the STDS.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#28:1> The sludge samples were used " as received" with no dewatering or

treatment of any kind.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#29:1> A gas-phase reactor residence time of 1.5 sec was used for all

experiments.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#30:1> Data were obtained under both oxidative and pyrolytic conditions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#31:1> However, only the pyrolysis data are reported due to their better

correlation with full-scale results.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#32:1> A more complete discussion of this observation will be presented in

the Discussion section of this report.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#33:1> <h> Incinerator Simulations </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#34:1> The typical multiple-hearth incinerator consists of 6 to 12

hearths on which the sludge progressively resides as it is dried and

combusted, and the ash is finally cooled.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#35:1> The sludge enters the top of the incinerator and progressively drops

through holes to lower hearths as it is raked and abraded by rabble arms (

14).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#36:1> There are 3 thermal regimes along the sludge path.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#37:1> In the drying zone ( T(gas) ~ 425 C, T(Sludge) ~ 70 C), which exists

on the upper hearths, water is gradually driven off the sludge so that the

material may be combusted.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#38:1> The sludge is actually incinerated in the central combustion zone (

T(gas) ~ 830 C), T(sludge) ~ 730 C, and the ash is cooled in the cooling zone

( T(gas) ~ 175 C, T(sludge) ~ 200 C) ( 12).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#39:1> Simulation of the staged increases in bed and gas temperatures

through the hearths of the multiple-hearth incinerator was achieved using a

series of four stepped increases in the temperature of the CDS Model 120

pyroprobe located in the insertion region of the STDS, accompanied by

specific downstream reactor temperatures.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#40:1> After a sample was loaded into the CDS pyroprobe and positioned in

the insertion region, the temperature was ramped from 50 C to 200 C @ 15

C/min and then from 200 C to 300 C @ 15 C/min, with downstream reactor

temperatures of 300 C and 450 C, respectively.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#41:1> These first two steps in the sludge exposure were designed to

determine the relative contribution to emissions of volatilization of the

sludge n the upper hearths of the multiple- hearth incinerator and the range

of temperatures which may be experienced there.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#42:1> In the third and fourth steps of the exposure scenario, the sludge

was rapidly taken to 550 C and then to 700 C using the heating coil of the

CDS pyroprobe assembly; the downstream reactor temperatures were 600 C and

800 C, respectively.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#43:1> These last two steps were designed to simulate the combustion zone of

the multiple-hearth incinerator and the range of temperatures which may be

experienced there.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#44:1> GC-MS analysis was performed at the end of each step in this process.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#45:1> The individual contributions were then directly summed to provide for

the total emissions from laboratory- simulated " incineration" of the sludge

sample.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#46:1> It was necessary to include data from all temperatures in the

laboratory simulation because emissions in the stacks of full-scale units are

a culmination of emissions from all of the hearths, not just the combustion

hearths.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#47:1> These results were qualitatively compared to mass emission factors

for each of the three full-scale facilities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#48:1> In a fluidized-bed incinerator, the mass of the bed is quite

large in relation to the injected sludge ( 14).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#49:1> This affords excellent abrasive action on the sludge and maintains

temperature uniformity within the reactor.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#50:1> Temperatures, which are limited by the melting point of the bed

material range from 750 C to 870 C and do not typically vary more than 5 C

throughout the bed or freeboard of the incinerator.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#51:1> Thus, the problems of volatilization and incomplete combustion

associated with the drying zone of the multiple-hearth incinerator are not

expected to be as severe with the fluidized-bed incinerator.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#52:1> Simulation of the single fluidized-bed unit was performed by

rapidly heating the sludge 700 C in the insertion region of the STDS,

followed by a downstream reactor exposure of 700 C.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#53:1> GC-MS techniques were again employed to perform analysis of the

reactor effluent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#54:1> Laboratory data from this exposure was then compared with full-scale

data from the single fluidized-bed facility.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#55:1> <h> RESULTS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#56:1> Table 2 lists the major emissions detected in laboratory testing

of the four sewage sludges.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#57:1> Experiments in which data acquisition was performed with the MSD in

full-scan mode ( i.e. 10 - - > 500 amu mass range scanned) showed that the

majority of mass emission from the thermal decomposition of all four sludges

resulted from decomposition of the biomass of the sludge itself.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#58:1> Many long- chain carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, amino acids,

etc., were detected.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#59:1> Even the two most common and abundant emissions seen from all four

sludges, benzene and toluene, were more a result of the thermal decomposition

of biological material present in the sludge than from any initial

contamination in the feed itself.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#60:1> This conclusion was based upon the observation that the mass emission

rate of benzene and toluene always surpassed any initial feed rate in the

sludge, if these two compounds were even detected in the sludge feed at all.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#61:1> The same phenomenon ( i.e. the majority of mass emissions resulting

from the sludge biomass) was observed in previous laboratory studies in which

relatively clean sludge and sludge spiked with known concentrations of

contaminants were subjected to controlled thermal exposures ( 12).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#62:1> Sulfur-containing compounds were only observed in laboratory

testing of samples from Sites 2 and 3.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#63:1> The sources of influent wastewater for both of these facilities were

listed as industrial and municipal, respectively.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#64:1> Perhaps the industrial contribution to the influent waste stream in

both cases was responsible for the sulfur-containing emissions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#65:1> The reactor effluent from the laboratory fluidized-bed sample

from Site 3 ( 700 C) was notably much cleaner in terms of number and relative

yield of products than that observed for the three multiple-hearth samples.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#66:1> This is as one might expect, based upon the more uniform combustion

provided for in the simulated fluidized-bed experiments.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#67:1> A comparison of laboratory and field test results is presented in

Table 3.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#68:1> This comparison is complicated by the difficulty of conducting

chemical analysis for specific toxic materials within an overwhelming organic

matrix as background.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#69:1> Both laboratory and field studies were subject to this difficulty.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#70:1> As a result, the joint program concentrated upon detection of

specific toxins contained in a generic " target list".
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#71:1> These toxins are enumerated in Table 3.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#72:1> Compounds were selected based upon toxicity, suspected prevalence in

sewage sludge, and representativeness of different classes of potential

pollutants.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#73:1> Compounds were also added to the target list based upon their

detection in a preliminary round of laboratory testing of sludges from the

four test sites, which was completed before full-scale testing was begun.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#74:1> This initial testing allowed for the addition of major " site

specific" emissions to the generic " target list".
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#75:1> The following paragraphs compare laboratory and field results.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#76:1> <h> Site 1: </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#77:1> Our previous laboratory studies of the oxidative pyrolysis of

pure tetrachloroethylene showed that carbon tetrachloride is formed as a PIC

( 15).
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#78:1> These experiments also showed that, given a hydrogen source,

trichloroethylene was readily formed as a PIC from tetrachloroethylene.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#79:1> The radical pool generated during the incineration of municipal

sludge would provide such a source of hydrogen.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#80:1> Thus, if tetrachloroethylene were present in a sludge stream to be

incinerated, these two products would likely be compounds detected in the

stack.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#81:1> Full-scale data generated at this site correlated with this

laboratory finding; tetrachloroethylene was present in the sludge feed, and

carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene were found in the stack effluent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#82:1> However, tetrachloroethylene was not detected in the sludge feed

sample furnished for laboratory testing, as evidenced by its absence in the

300 C transport analysis of the sludge sample.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#83:1> Thus, an explanation for the absence in laboratory data of these two

emissions is the absence of tetrachloroethylene in the sludge feed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#84:1> This argument may be extended to explain the lack of observation of

any other chlorinated products.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#85:1> Since no chlorine-containing compounds were identified in the sludge

feed, there was no source of chlorine for the formation of chlorinated

products.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#86:1> Finally, tetrachloroethylene and chloroform were reportedly

contaminants of the scrubber water used at this facility.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#87:1> It is very likely that stripping of both these compounds from the

water during the scrubbing process contributed to their emissions in the

stack.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#88:1> Therefore, these two compounds would not be expected in the emissions

from thermal testing performed in the laboratory.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#89:1> <h> Site 2: </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#90:1> In the feed samples collected during full-scale testing from Site

2, two chlorinated compounds, methylene chloride and chlorobenzene were found

which were not detected in the sample provided for laboratory testing In

previous laboratory experiments, we have found that 1,1-dichloroethylene,

1,2- dichloroethylene, and trichloroethylene were all formed as products from

the pyrolytic decomposition of pure methylene chloride ( 16)- .
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#91:1> Thus, it is not surprising that a facility incinerating sludge

contaminated with methylene chloride had these compounds present in its

emissions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#92:1> Since no methylene chloride was present in the sludge feed sample

received for laboratory testing, detection of these compounds could not be

expected.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#93:1> The chlorobenzene emissions detected in the stack effluent of

this facility probably resulted from a combination of two processes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#94:1> The first is the original contamination found in the sludge feed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#95:1> Previous studies have shown chlorobenzene to be a very stable

compound, even when decompoSed as part of a mixture ( 17,18)-.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#96:1> Thus, the appearance of chlorobenzene in the stack is probably due in

part to its ability to undergo relatively harsh thermal exposures and escape

unscathed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-021#97:1> The second contribution to the emission of chlorobenzene at the

full- scale facility is the possibility that this compound was formed as a

PIC.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#98:1> We have conducted many studies involving the decomposition of benzene

and/or toluene or related compounds in the presence of chlorinated species.
<ICE-USA:W2A-021#99:1> The free chlorine radicals generated in such a reaction atmosphere

have host of chlorine- containing compounds were detected in the sludge feed

at the full-scale facility, it is logical that chlorobenzene was detected in

the stack.</p> </I>
