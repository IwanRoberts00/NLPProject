<ICE-USA:W1B-008#1:1> <h> 19 July 90</h>

<p> Hi Ann! How 's life!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#2:1> How is your summer going!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#3:1> Mine is going well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#4:1> I'm working in the college archives again.
<ICE- 'mA:W1B-008#5:1> It 's not the most exciting job in the world, but it keeps me out of

trouble.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#6:1> My last day of work is 3 August.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#7:1> I'm probably heading home on the 9th or 10th.
< 'mE-USA:W1B-008#8:1> Then I'm off to Iowa City.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#9:1> Yes 'mfolks, Iowa City.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#10:1> The University of Iowa has kindly offered me a healthy stipend so

that I can pursue a PhD in mathematics.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#11:1> Aren't they sweet! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#12:1> I'm planning on leaving Buffalo ( well, Holland) 'mn the 14th,

staying with a friend in Indianapolis, and getting to Iowa on the 15th.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#13:1> I get to make this trip all by myself with only an AM radio for

company.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#14:1> Sounds fun doesn't it! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#15:1> Now for the really exciting part.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#16:1> I talked to Michael the other day.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#17:1> We're going to try to get together some 'ree between the 3rd and 9th

depending on when he can get time off.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#18:1> ( He 's in Portsmouth, NH)
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#19:1> If anyone else is in the Boston area ( or New England for that

matter) and would like to join us, please contact one of us a.s.a.p.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#20:1> I can be reached at [ - - - ] .
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#21:1> My home phone is [ - - - ] .
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#22:1> If you have to leave a message at home, tell them it 's urgent,

important, etc. Otherwise I won't get it till 2 weeks later.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#23:1> Michael can be reached at [ - - - ] </p> <h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#24:1> 27 July 90</h> <h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#25:1> Dear Ann,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#26:1> Hi! I know, I saw you less than 24 hours ago and yet I'm writing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#27:1> I have s 'mmany thoughts, impressions, etc.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#28:1> going through my mind on the whole experience.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#29:1> It was amazing, fun, unbelievable.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#30:1> And I want to do it over and over and over again.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#31:1> I'm not very good at putting my thoughts on p 'mer, so this letter

may be quite rambly.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#32:1> It 's funny: I need to share what 's in my head and even though it 's

pleasant I'm having a hard time.</p>

<p> <ICE-US 'mW1B-008#33:1> You are one of the few people who knows the whole scoop between

Marc and me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#34:1> Very few people are curious and those who are often don't understand.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#35:1> What 's the big deal they ask.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#36:1> So what if he 's Jewish and your not!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#37:1> It 's a whole different way of thinking about life for one.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#38:1> There 's a clash of traditions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#39:1> There 's a major difference in what to believe and how to raise

children.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#40:1> It 's a big problem.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#41:1> It 's hard being so attached to someone and knowing it 's in your best

interests to break up. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#42:1> I'd like to meet Sh 'dna.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#43:1> I'm still a bit amazed that Micha 'm, yes our Michael, is getting

married.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#44:1> Aaahhh! Too many of my friends are doing the big M lately.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#45:1> I'm still amused with your reacti 'm to michael 's announcement.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#46:1> Maybe subconciously from our phone calls I'd realized that 'dptial

plans were in the making, but I really wasn't surprised.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#47:1> I think Shayna must be one very special woman if Michael is thinking

of marrying her so soon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#48:1> I do want to meet her.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#49:1> All day yesterday Michael kept reminding of Maurice from the

Newhart Show.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#50:1> I couldn't put my finger on who he was reminding me of until he put

his glasses on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#51:1> Then the resemblance was painfully obvious.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#52:1> I'm not sure if it was his mann 'misms or what, but I was " seeing"

Maurice occassionally.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#53:1> I hope it wasn't obvious yesterday how much I still... like!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#54:1> Michael ( Not the right word but close enough I guess) I was

interested in him 5 years ago and all of it came flooding back upon seeing

him.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#55:1> He 's such an interesting, fun, intelligent, caring person in a world

of " ASSHOLES".
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#56:1> I'm sure you know his virtues, 'mo I won't go on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#57:1> I'm trying to keep everything 'm check so I don't lose a good friend

just because I can't act like a reasonable human being around him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#58:1> Of course you're the only person 'ree told this to.
<ICE 'veA:W1B-008#59:1> I don't want to be a pain in the butt to anyone involved, but I had

to tell someone who knew us both and who would understand.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#60:1> What do you do when you're mind keeps remin 'reg you of how well the

person in front of you kisses! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#61:1> ( rhetorical question) It 's a good thing I'm able to laugh at all
 'mof this.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#62:1> ( P.S. I realized 5 yrs ago that nothing would ever happen between

us, so... )
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#63:1> Anyway, other things about yesterday... </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#64:1> Do you realize that if I stay in mathematics and don't go into

academia I'm probably going to end 'm working for the gov't in some way,

shape or form!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#65:1> I'm not going to do actuar 'ml or accounting stuff ( computers are

out) which means unless I find something else to do in business ( not math),

whatever I'm doing will receive fun 'mng either directly or indirectly from

the gov't. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#66:1> Sad but true.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#67:1> I could always become a professional archivist, I suppose...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#68:1> ( This is true for most scientists outside the medical field.) Last

night I stayed at Tracy 's.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#69:1> We stayed up for a while talking and we talked for a bit this morning

before I left.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#70:1> She really sounds like she 's got her act together.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#71:1> She knows what she wants to do and why she wants to do it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#72:1> Michael seems to know what he 's doing as well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#73:1> Ok, so he has many options, but he knows what they are and any one of

them would be the right choice for him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#74:1> ( I talk in cliches a lot, don't I!)
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#75:1> You seem to have a pretty good idea of what you enjoy doing as well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#76:1> The impression I have is that you enjoy your job immensely.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#77:1> I have a feeling that you'll always be 'llvolved with the cultural

scene in some way.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#78:1> You love it too much to get out of it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#79:1> I'm totally confused. 'mICE-USA:W1B-008#80:1> I like doing math, but I'm seriously doubting 'mf grad school was the

right choice for me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#81:1> I'm scared about the w 'mle idea.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#82:1> And why the hell am I moving to Iowa! ! Almost all of my friends are

on the East Coast. Up until April I was still debating between archives and

math grad school.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#83:1> I've been accepted 've SUNY Albany for archives school and I deferred

for a year just in case I change my mind. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#84:1> I have no idea what I would do if I had to find a real job.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#85:1> Ack!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#86:1> Want to hear something funny!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#87:1> One of the things that scares me most about grad school is that if I

can survive mathematically, I have to learn either German or Russian.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#88:1> I can read French and Portuguese with the help of a dictionary for

the most part.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#89:1> I can't speak either of them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#90:1> I may never be able to speak another language comfortably.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#91:1> It has something to do with my brain processes but I'm not sure

exact 'm what.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#92:1> It sucks!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#93:1> Hey!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#94:1> You should be impressed. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#95:1> This is the longest letter I've written in ag 've I hope your

visit with J.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#96:1> goes well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#97:1> I'm envious, you kno 'm I hope the Thanksgiving thing happens.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#98:1> Tracy 's going to Florida with her parents, so she won't be able to

come.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#99:1> As long as I know by the end of October, I should be able to make it.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#100:1> ( This is for fare reasons ( plane, train).) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#101:1> The more I thought about it the more I realized that I probably

couldn't convince my parents to put us all up. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#102:1> You know, I had so much fun yesterday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#103:1> You guys are a wonderful bunch of people.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#104:1> I'm very lucky to h 'me you as friends.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#105:1> I just want to make sure I see and/or talk to you more often in the

future.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#106:1> I don't want another five years to go by before we regroup again.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#107:1> Are you going to write to AFS NY!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#108:1> Do you want me to do this!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#109:1> I definitely think this is worth sending in, esp.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#110:1> The part about eating Brazilian.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#111:1> How did you ever find that place anyway!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#112:1> My pictures will be back by Wednesday at the latest.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#113:1> I'll send cop 'll of course.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#114:1> Yeah!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#115:1> I'm going to find 'mplace of honor for these photos.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#116:1> Please send/give me copies of your photos too.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#117:1> I'll reimburs 'llou for them. I couldn't stop bouncing off the walls

at work this afternoon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#118:1> I was still in such a good mood from seeing you. When we were having

dinner last night, I felt like a scene right out of St Elmo 's Fire or some

similar reunion-theme movie.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#119:1> It was really bizarre to see myself in a situation that I normally

see as happening to people when they're older. 'reCE-USA:W1B-008#120:1> ( Did that make sense!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#121:1> Simply, I felt old) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#122:1> I feel much closer to you now than when we first met.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#123:1> I learned more about you, michael, and Tracy yesterday than I did

when we were in Brasil I think.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#124:1> Strange how that worked out. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#125:1> Well, Ann, I have company and must go.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#126:1> I will try to see you before I leave.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#127:1> Please keep in touch and feel free to come visit in Iowa. Best

wishes, </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#128:1> Beijos, </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#129:1> Wendy</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#130:1> P.S.I want to know what 's happening and Happening in your life,

ok! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#131:1> </I>


<I> 1/17/90 My dearest, sweetest, darlingest Ann: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#132:2> My mother was hysterical with laughter after reading the back of

your envelope last night...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#133:2> PEANUT BUTTER LOVE...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#134:2> an interesting concept to say the least.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#135:2> She was absolutely convinced that you will someday become a writer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#136:2> I actually hadn't ever envisioned you in that profession, but after

she said that last night, it really makes perfect sense, my dear.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#137:2> You have a gift!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#138:2> I wish that I could be one iota as self-expressed through writing

that you are.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#139:2> But anyway, it 's just a thought.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#140:2> And if you don't decide to pursue a career in written expression,

just keep writing to me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#141:2> Someday one of our grand-kids-nieces-nephews will make a mint

publishing the complete correspondance between - - - and - - - .
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#142:2> That 's life, right!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#143:2> Figures. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#144:2> Anyway.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#145:2> Your letter was quite timely, considering the current mess in the

Middle East.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#146:2> I think that you and I are again on the same wavelength concerning

this issue.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#147:2> ( How surprising). Now that they've begun 'vee fighting, I just want

it to be overwith as soon as possible.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#148:2> And from what " they" ( related to " the guy") say, our forces are

only taking out strategic military-related stuff in Iraq.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#149:2> Hopefully, " they" are right.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#150:2> I don't see the need for massacre or anything.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#151:2> But like I was saying to - - - ( remember her!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#152:2> ) last night, I feel generally ignorant to all the details and

twists in this conversation about the " war" so I'd rath 'd not contribute to

meaningless discussion, know what I mean, until I'm adequa 'mly versed enought

to be truly meaningless. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#153:2> So.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#154:2> I'm glad t 'mhear that the hatemongers have eased up on you and that

things are going well for you and your woman.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#155:2> Smitten. A good word.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#156:2> Sounds as though you may be falling...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#157:2> I'm very h 'mpy for you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#158:2> Glad to hear that you got some good - - - - out of it, too. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#159:2> Well, anyway...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#160:2> I'm workin 'mat A.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#161:2> in the I.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#162:2> Building at [ - - ] and [ - - - ] ( you know, the building with the

funny looking bolt thing on top...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#163:2> a sort of bluish building)...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#164:2> I'm workin 'mon the 31st Floor that overlooks West Philly and beyond.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#165:2> It 's quite an impressive view.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#166:2> I can see the Commodore Barry Bridge from here. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#167:2> Well, the security in the building has been beefed up

considerably.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#168:2> Lots of men in uniform looking skeptical...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#169:2> at me sometimes, being a temp and all, I'm not a 'm that familiar

looking around these parts.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#170:2> I haven't been stopped, though, which is good.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#171:2> I always get nervous in those situations...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#172:2>
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#173:2> a paranoia that maybe I am actually doing something wrong...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#174:2> Catholic upbringing, I'm sure. 'm/p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#175:2> Speaking of doing something wrong, well actually right ( makes a

lot of sense I realize) ...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#176:2> - - - - had its first public demonstration at C 's inauguration on

Tuesday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#177:2> They ( " they" as in related to " the guy") broadcast the

inauguration on ACTION NEWS Tuesday at lunch ( I was watching) and they were

being so loud that he actually asked them to be quite and that he got their

message and he wanted to give his message to the State.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#178:2> It was really cool.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#179:2> I was really bummed that I couldn't be there. It 's too bad that all

the gulf stuff was going on the same day because they probably would have

interviewed the protestors, etc. Oh well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#180:2> C.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#181:2> GOT THE MESSAGE.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#182:2> I'm rea 'my psyched.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#183:2> Of course - - - and I were both at work, but some of the other - - -

- staged the whole thing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#184:2> A! I'm rea 'my proud of those guys.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#185:2> The news reporter said there were about a hundred demonstrators!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#186:2> I sent them a thank you note yesterday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#187:2> What a good feeling. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#188:2> I wrote - - - a letter yesterday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#189:2> I wonder how long it will take to get there.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#190:2> ( A fleeting thought) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#191:2> I'm lea 'mng for - - - on Saturday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#192:2> - - - is taking me back in the FIREBIRD.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#193:2> Ooooooooooo!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#194:2> Like, cool, man...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#195:2> We are bringing - - - - 's old IKEA desk back in the FIREBIRD.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#196:2> That oughta be fun trying to fit it in the FIREBIRD.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#197:2> We're 'reking it apart and all.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#198:2> I have an office at - - - 's house ( it 's off my bedroom) and I want

to have a desk, so my ma said I could take - - - 's old one.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#199:2> Pretty nice, eh! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#200:2> I cannot wait to go back to the studio and throw!!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#201:2> My hands are aching for the clay...
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#202:2> Everytime I think about it I go crazy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#203:2> I told - - - that I' 'mgoing to mix up about 1000 lbs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#204:2> Of clay and roll naked in it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#205:2> Of course he found it arousing - - as a matter of fact, so do I, for

artistic reasons of course.
<ICE-USA:W1B-008#206:2> I can't wait. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-008#207:2> Well, anyway, I 've been typing for about a half an hour so I

better get back to sitting around waiting to file stuff. Besides, they won='

be too happy about me using up all the typewriter ribbon. </p>
