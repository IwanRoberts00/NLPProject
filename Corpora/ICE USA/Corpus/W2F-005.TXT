<ICE-USA:W2F-005#1:1> <h> Spring Tide</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#2:1> <h> Vulma and Me</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#3:1> <h> by Wayne Rhodes</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#4:1> My father, who grew up on a Pennsylvania farm, loved the ocean and

thought every boy should have his own boat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#5:1> So one spring, he spent several evenings by our seaside home working

under a lantern late into the night.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#6:1> Eagerly, I fetched the tools and held the tape measure while he marked

carefully with the flat carpenter 's pencil he kept tucked behind his ear.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#7:1> Each night after putting the baby to bed, Mom came outside to watch.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#8:1> " It 's going to be a beautiful boat," she said as she stood in the

lantern 's glow, wind pressing her skirt to her knees, blowing her dark, wavy

hair into her eyes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#9:1> The boat was a sturdy ten-foot skiff, a three-seater with a small

keel that caused it to pitch slightly when ashore as if riding the crest of a

wave.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#10:1> Each spring I sanded the peeling paint, caulked the seams, primed

inside and out, then chose new colors.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#11:1> The first year, I painted it emerald green, the second, navy blue.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#12:1> But the year my boat drifted off, it was scarlet with white trim and

a waterline outlined in black.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#13:1> When we heard it had washed ashore on the other side of the

harbor, anchoring itself in a tangle of marsh grass, I was relieved.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#14:1> I hadn't notice the new moon, and the spring tide had lifted my boat

from it 's perch.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#15:1> As my father and I drove across town in his pickup to retrieve it, I

felt like his foolish child.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#16:1> The town was quiet and fall-like that July day.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#17:1> Whitecaps rose on the deep water like goose flesh.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#18:1> On such days you can taste salt on your lips and later when you try

to comb your hair, you find it hopelessly matted and snarled and gritty with

sand.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#19:1> As we passed Egg Island, men with waders and long-handle rakes

combed the flats, leaving deep, purple scars in the smooth, brown silt while

gulls wheeled expectantly overhead.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#20:1> A few sunbathers dotted the shore, most lying between dunes or beside

the breakwater seeking shelter from wind and sand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#21:1> In the channel, two or three outboards surged onward like salmon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#22:1> That day, I had more on my mind than weather or lost boats.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#23:1> While surveying the empty landscape, my thoughts turned to my mother

who for the second time in two months was gone without warning--once to visit

her sister, this time her mother, or so I was told.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#24:1> Before she left, my parents talked in their bedroom late into the

night.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#25:1> I heard no words, only voices, intermittent and foreboding, like

waves before a storm.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#26:1> The next morning, my mother stood by the door in her blue travel

dress with the small, white polka dots.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#27:1> She kissed my sister and me good-bye and said, " Behave for your

father.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#28:1> I watched my father who stood holding Mom 's suitcase, one hand on the

doorknob.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#29:1> As though caught in a lie, he never looked up.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#30:1> Always my father had been quiet, but during that spring and

summer he seemed lost.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#31:1> Some days, he sat at the breakfast table resting his forehead in one

hand, a cigarette smoldering in the other, its cool white ashes falling

silently on the table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#32:1> Other times, he stirred his coffee absently, the cup ringing softly

like a tiny bell.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#33:1> Mom busied herself in the kitchen washing out coffee cups, mixing

pancake batter, struggling with a can of frozen orange juice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#34:1> " Eat your breakfast," she told Kristen, " and you'll be big an 'll
strong like your brother."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#35:1> Even Kristen seemed to know something was up: " What 's the

matter, Daddy?
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#36:1> Are you sad?" she asked kneeling on her chair, rocking back and forth

in her Rocky and Bullwinkle pajamas, stirring her Lucky Charms.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#37:1> After Mom left, Kristen and I were on our own most of the time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#38:1> Dad usually came home from the fish market at 5:30 and handed me a

bag of groceries.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#39:1> While he showered and I scrubbed the potatoes, Kristen asked, " When

is Mommy coming home?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#40:1> Soon," I told her.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#41:1> After dinner, Dad kissed Kristen good night, said, " Mind your

brother," and left.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#42:1> Often, I waited up all hours listening from my bedroom window for his

truck.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#43:1> Always, he turned off the headlights before turning into the darkened

driveway.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#44:1> He closed the cab door softly and walked slowly across the gravel

surface.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#45:1> Once inside, he took off his shoes and, in his stocking feet, crept

up the creaking stairs and past my bedroom door where I lay still, quietly

cursing him for his silence. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#46:1> My father and I traced the shoreline around the harbor, past

dunes and beach grass, past the marina, the bait shop, and the Tastee Freeze.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#47:1> Dad had the truck radio tuned to a country-western station.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#48:1> There was one song--the name escapes me, but sometimes even now when

it 's late at night and everything is still, that deep, trembling voice and

the soft sighs of those steel guitars, they all come back to me just as if

they had never stopped.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#49:1> When we spotted the grounded boat, Dad backed the truck into a

clearing beside the road.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#50:1> We let down the tailgate, then walked through beach grass and over

deep sand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#51:1> The boat sat about twenty yards beyond a shallow tidal pool.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#52:1> " We'll have to 'llde out," my father said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#53:1> " I'll go," I 'lld him as I took off my sneakers and rolled up my

jeans.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#54:1> While my father waited, he lit a cigarette, turning his back to the

wind and cupping the match in his hands.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#55:1> Cautiously, I stepped over the rocky shoreline to the cool

water 's edge.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#56:1> When I neared the boat, fiddler crabs scurried into their holes, and

terns, protecting nearby nests, swooped toward me and screeched warnings.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#57:1> I grabbed the boat and wrenched it free, eventually tugging it into

the water.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#58:1> I looked up, but Dad didn't see me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#59:1> He stared across the harbor at the rows of cottages and the eroding

dunes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#60:1> Once I reached shore, Dad took the bow and I the stern as we

trudged through the sand toward the truck.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#61:1> We loaded it stern first, each taking a side, lifting it up and

sliding it onto the truck bed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#62:1> Dad handed me my shoes, and I sat on the tailgate with my back

against the boat while I brushed the sand from my feet and laced my sneakers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#63:1> Again he stared across the bay, lingering briefly before stepping

into the cab.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#64:1> At first, we rode in silence.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#65:1> Finally, about halfway home, my father spoke.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#66:1> He said my mother was at the hospital--not my grandmother 's, not my

aunt 's.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#67:1> The first time for tests, this time, surgery.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#68:1> I listened calmly to my father 's calm words: " We didn't want to

worry you," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#69:1> " The doctors say there 's this new treatment, some new medicine.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#70:1> Who knows? If things haven't gone too far--"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#71:1> As he spoke, my mind wandered: I lay in a lawn chair on the front

deck, eyes closed as the sun warmed my face.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#72:1> Overhead an airplane droned, miles off and fading, and from an

upstairs window came my mother 's voice as she sang the baby to sleep.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#73:1> By evening the wind had stopped.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#74:1> After dinner, I left Kristen with the neighbors and took the boat

out, rowing in long, smooth strokes, oarlocks rumbling, oars knifing the

surface, leaving faint whirling ripples in the glassy sea, propelling me

farther and farther over the deep, blue water, past the jetty, out where you

can see everything--draggers tied to long, jagged rows of marina pilings,

scattered sloops moored in the harbor basin, gray shingled cottages clustered

along the shore, white clapboard houses with their tall peaks and dormers

perched on higher ground, and the tarnished copper steeple of the

Congregational church towering above all else.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#75:1> Finally, I put up the oars and sat adrift, my wake quickly swallowed

by the stillness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#76:1> A heavy silence hung over the town and covered the bay.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#77:1> I heard no surf, no wind, no voices, only distant sighs from the

whistle buoy and water dripping from my oars.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#78:1> My mother lived barely two months more.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#79:1> A few weeks before Mom died, Dad took Kristen and me to see her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#80:1> Shrunken and childlike, curled beneath her hospital sheets, she

moaned for the doctors to leave her alone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#81:1> After that one visit, Dad never took us again.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#82:1> It was over three years before I really understood what it meant.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#83:1> The moving men had finished loading the tractor trailer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#84:1> My father, his second wife, and Kristen had already left for their

new home in Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#85:1> Since I was staying with friends for the rest of my senior year, it

was my job to close up our house.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#86:1> After the huge truck pulled away, I walked through our home for

the last time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#87:1> The rooms looked spacious and unfamiliar.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#88:1> Gone were the things that had surrounded me my whole life--the wicker

rocking chair, the camelback sofa, my mother 's carnival glass, the set of

Funk and Wagnalls on the mantel, the wedding pictures on the den wall.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#89:1> As I walked through each room, across the bare wood floors, my

footsteps echoed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#90:1> Before leaving, I opened the cellar door, pulled the light chain,

and found my way down the narrow stairs to the concrete floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#91:1> The musty smell of old clothes and newspapers lingered.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#92:1> The tool boxes, cabinets, wardrobes, and chests had all been packed

away, making the cellar appear cavernous in the dim light.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#93:1> Off to one side by the window wells sat my boat, belly-up beneath

a naked light bulb, resting on the same spindly, paint-speckled saw horses my

father had used when he built it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#94:1> Seeing it there all by itself made me realize how, in a sense, my

family too had been swept away and left adrift unprepared for the coming

tide.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#95:1> Lingering briefly alongside the boat, I chipped away at its

peeling paint and ran my hand over its worn keel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#96:1> For a moment, I saw my father sitting beside me in his truck on the

day we recovered the boat, his hair windblown, his face taut.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#97:1> I felt the cool north wind and the salt 's sting.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#98:1> Then, I saw my mother and father standing beside my unfinished

boat, arm in arm under the lantern light, both of them smiling like

newlyweds.<p><ICE-USA:W2F-005#> <h> Vulma and Me<h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#99:1> Although Vulma did wonders for my vocabulary, words to describe

her remain elusive.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#100:1> Onomatopoetic comes to mind, though that one might take some

explaining.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#101:1> Vulma and her mother had just bought a small cottage near my

house, and her arrival did not go unnoticed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#102:1> Everyone, including myself, considered her a kind of goddess.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#103:1> Auburn hair, chestnut eyes, long legs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#104:1> The works.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#105:1> Wherever she went, heads turned.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#106:1> The joke around town was that her reputation preceded her . . . by

several inches.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#107:1> To add to her mystique, Vulma was from Quebec and spoke with a

French accent.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#108:1> But perhaps what bewildered people most about Vulma was the crush

she had for me.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#109:1> By all accounts, this should have been welcome news.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#110:1> After all, I'd 'deen the toothpaste ads, the chewing gum commercials,

the new car calendars.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#111:1> I knew what was expected of me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#112:1> However, there was one problem--I couldn't stand to hear her talk.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#113:1> You see, Vulma used words like phenomenal whenever she got the

chance--as in, " Isn't this weather phenomenal?" or, " That 's a phenomenal

song!" Thoughts of how she learned to talk like that gave me chills.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#114:1> To me, Vulma 's English was a foreign language.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#115:1> Granted, a lot of guys would have found ways around that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#116:1> Believe me I tried, but I knew if she didn't have that long, wavy

hair, or if her Levis didn't behave that way when she walked, she never would

have crossed my mind.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#117:1> When people asked why I didn't jump at the chance to be with

her, I shrugged.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#118:1> This was the seventies, mind you, and sex was a breeze.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#119:1> At least it was supposed to be.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#120:1> After all, we had The Pill and Roe vs. Wade.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#121:1> Barring allergies to penicillin, you were home free.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#122:1> Apparently, I just wasn't with it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#123:1> " You 're crazy!" guys said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#124:1> A couple of them flat out wanted to punch me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#125:1> If they couldn't have her, they at least wanted the benefit of some

play-by-play.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-005#126:1> As you might expect, my sexual preference quickly became a

source of speculation.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#127:1> While I could have spent my time with Vulma, instead, I spent most

of it with two guys who, to my great misfortune, happened to be named Peter

and Paul.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#128:1> This naturally inspired someone ( Peter, I think) with the brilliant

idea to start calling me Mary, which by itself wouldn't have been such a big

deal.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#129:1> But the singing--that was too much.
<ICE-USA:W2F-005#130:1> Seeing Vulma, then, only reminded me what a phenomenal

disappointment I was to my gender.</p> </I>
