<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#1:1> A yellowed clay-splattered poster hangs on the wall in Tim

Ludwig 's high-school ceramics classroom: " A good pot, like a person, reveals

itself gradually through continual contact over long periods of time."
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#2:1> Thousands of students have pinched, rolled, coiled and thrown pots

under the spell of that Warren MacKenzie quote and the teacher who believes

it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#3:1> Most of them undergo a change during the 18 weeks spent in Ludwig 's

class at Spruce Creek High School.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#4:1> Some become potters for life; others never touch wet clay again, but

they all gain the understanding that art and life are inseparable, that a

good pot can represent a person. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#5:1> Ludwig ( " Lud," as past and present students call him) gets

through to Kids with his own brand of humor mixed with mutual respect.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#6:1> He is drill sergeant, surfer dude, sage, stand-up comic, surrogate

parent and artist wrapped up in a loud shirt. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#7:1> The bell rings and 20 or so students snake their way through the

equipment- packed classroom to a table or a potter 's wheel.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#8:1> They take the initiative and place themselves where they will need to

work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#9:1> Several voluntarily begin wiping down clay-covered countertops and

tables.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#10:1> What would their parents give to be a fly on these walls? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#11:1> Ludwig, wearing Levi 's, a bright T-shirt and surfer sandals,

closes the door to the hallway and walks to the middle of the room.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#12:1> His still-blond wavy hair styled in the current " do" frames his

bespectacled face, belying his 48 years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#13:1> His appearance makes him unobtrusive in a roomful of teenagers who

notice these things but never admit it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#14:1> The " Lud Show" is about to begin. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#15:1> " Listen up, boys and girls and anything else I might have

missed," Ludwig says loudly, before announcing a guest.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#16:1> The students giggle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#17:1> One girl mutters something to her neighbor and they both roll their

eyes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#18:1> " Are we buddies again, Allison?" he asks her. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#19:1> " I don't know," she says coolly, munching from a bag of cheese

puffs and checking her fingernails. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#20:1> " Well, you let me know when we are," Ludwig says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#21:1> As he begins to walk away, he makes a sound with his mouth like a

duck 's quack.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#22:1> He spins around, points at Allison and bellows " Well, excuuuuuse

youuuuu!"
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#23:1> The class erupts in laughter.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#24:1> Even Allison cracks a smile.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#25:1> This is one of Ludwig 's tried and true panaceas, but it never gets

old. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#26:1> " That 's better," he says, almost to himself as he makes his way

around the room to help the next student with work or with life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#27:1> " I had one girl in class who was so rude, it took me 18 weeks to

teach her that she couldn't go through life that way or everyone would just

hate her," he recalls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#28:1> " At the end of the year she gave me a note that said, 'Thank you,

Mr. Ludwig.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#29:1> I don't think I'm so rude anymore.' </p>

<p> 'mICE-USA:W2B-004#30:1> " I'm a kid person," Ludwig admits. 'm<ICE-USA:W2B-004#31:1> " I can play with them and tease them and do weird things.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#32:1> That 's very entertaining for them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#33:1> Everything is very loosey-goosey and they like that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#34:1> And I like it, too. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#35:1> " It disrupts what they think life 's about, and it makes them

think a little bit more.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#36:1> Maybe they'll pay more attention to 'llings around them, then tie it

into their work." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#37:1> Ludwig 's ceramics program at this secondary school in Port

Orange, Florida, just south of Daytona Beach, is better equipped than many

university programs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#38:1> He was hired when the school opened in 1975, so he was able to plan

the space and procure the equipment needed to run a proper ceramics program.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#39:1> Students who get an early start in Ludwig 's program might spend four

years seriously working in clay before entering college.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#40:1> More than one has been disappointed when forced to make mugs in

college Ceramics 101 after throwing intricate teapots in Ludwig 's class. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#41:1> " A lot of kids say that they want to be a pottery teacher after

taking my class," he says, " but I had to work very hard for what we have

here at Spruce Creek.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#42:1> It 's not the normal situation." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#43:1> Ludwig came into the ceramics world through the back door.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#44:1> After completing a bachelor 's degree in fine arts from the University

of Florida ( U.F.) in 1968, he needed a job to support himself and his wife.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#45:1> He was offered a job teaching elementary art at South and North

Ridgewood Elementary Schools in Daytona Beach.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#46:1> He had never thought about becoming a teacher, but the offer was

enticing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#47:1> The pay was

&dollar;6400 a year, and he jumped at it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#48:1> " We were living on nothing, and that was a lot of money to me at the

time." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#49:1> By 1970, he was teaching art at Daytona 's Mainland High School.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#50:1> He sensed the students were frustrated with traditional painting and

drawing so he decided to try something a little unconventional. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#51:1> One day, he " loaded them all on a bus and took them to the St.

Johns River.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#52:1> We dug our own clay from the riverbanks, made a bunch of pinch pots

and fired them over an open fire.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#53:1> We brought some clay back to school and started making pots.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#54:1> It was so spontaneous and the kids loved it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#55:1> They almost burned the schoolhouse down.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#56:1> They thought that was really neat." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#57:1> Ludwig 's previous clay experience was limited to a mixed-media

class at Stetson University.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#58:1> His U.F. major had been printmaking and lithography. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#59:1> " So while I was teaching the kids about pots, I was learning

about pots.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#60:1> I try to avoid showing them how to do things, but still I want them

to see what people have done with clay and how expressive they've been," he

sa 've
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#61:1> " I want them to feel the impact that a piece of pottery can have.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#62:1> I always talk to them about the favorite cup thing: How Mom or Dad

has a favorite cup, and how upset they would be if it got broken.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#63:1> This little clay object, this little materialistic thing can mean so

much.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#64:1> That 's an important fact of life that a student can connect with."

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#65:1> He interrupts his conversation and yells across the room to a boy

coiling a long piece of rolled clay around the lid of a half-finished jar.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#66:1> " Hey!
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#67:1> Does your mother know you left the house wearing that shirt?
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#68:1> Man, that is one uuuuuugly shirt!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#69:1> The startled boy looks down at himself, then at Ludwig.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#70:1> They are wearing the same orange and yellow striped shirt.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#71:1> Again the class bursts into laughter. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#72:1> " He 's the funniest teacher I've ever had," Am 've Boye says

quietly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#73:1> " He always tells really corny jokes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#74:1> " But he 's not just our teacher," she adds, looking around to be

certain Ludwig can't hear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#75:1> " He 's our friend.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#76:1> He gives us the option to think for ourselves.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#77:1> Other teachers tell us what to think." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#78:1> " I tell them that whatever they do to their pots, that 's what

they are," Ludwig says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#79:1> " If they copy that 's what they are.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#80:1> If they are technical and precise, that 's what they are.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#81:1> Nobody is going to change what they are.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#82:1> That 's why I constantly stress this honesty thing to the kids.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#83:1> I tell them, 'Don't worry about what you do; just be honest about

what you're doing. 're</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#84:1> Effie Pappas looks up from the lidded jar upon which she is

carefully applying streaks and lines of colored slips.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#85:1> " You don't just learn about pots in this class," she says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#86:1> " You learn about yourself from the way you make pots.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#87:1> And when you break a pot, it 's like you break a piece of you." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#88:1> The students are assigned various projects to be completed during

the semester.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#89:1> Some are specific vessel forms, such as pitchers, vases, bowls and

teapots.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#90:1> Others are more ambiguous, such as the slab project that usually

leads to some large geometric shape, or a drapemold project that requires

students to disguise their pots so that the original mold shapes cannot be

determined.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#91:1> More esoteric projects required in a recent Ludwig class included a

teapot that had to resemble a vegetable, fruit or plant, and a "

collaborative cup" where each student started a basic cup shape then passed

it on to a neighbor for completion. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#92:1> Occasionally, there will be a project on a grander scale that

requires the cooperation of many students of different skill levels.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#93:1> Every year, for example, they participate in the " Empty Bowls"

project, a national program for which potters make bowls, then local

restaurants donate soup to fill the bowls to raise money to help the

homeless. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#94:1> Another large project recently undertaken by the students was a

commission from a local delicatessen owner whose daughter was one of Ludwig 's

students.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#95:1> He needed 200 jar lids to replace the chipped and cracked ones that

were covering his table jars of mustard and relish, plus he ordered 48 new

lidded jars.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#96:1> The money raised bought art books, videos and a new clay mixer to

replace the school 's old mortar mixer, which frequently deposited metal

scrapings into the clay. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#97:1> Three years ago, during the summer, Ludwig and his students

designed and constructed a gas-fired salt kiln.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#98:1> After gathering information from potters throughout the United States

who were using such kilns, they decided to adjust a common design in an

attempt to avoid possible hazardous situations ( such as burns and back

injuries) in a school environment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#99:1> Although some of the potters using a two-burner Big Bertha system

said they were not fully convinced of its success, Ludwig and his students

believed that bringing the burners in through the back of the kiln on either

side of the chimney-rather than from the front or sides-would provide a more

natural draft while maintaining a safe distance between kiln-loading

teenagers and red- hot burners.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#100:1> They also included a short bag wall against the side walls-in

addition to the normal bag wall positioned between the firebox and the ware

chamber-to prevent the salt from deteriorating the hardbrick.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#101:1> The result is a 40-cubic-foot, downdraft, sprung-arch kiln that

performs faithfully every two weeks, reaching Cone 8-10 in about nine or ten

hours. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#102:1> Spruce Creek is also fortunate enough to have a 36-cubic-foot,

wood-fired kiln.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#103:1> Built by Ludwig and his students during the 1985-86 school year with

the help of former Florida potter George Lowe, it fires to Cone 10-12 in

about 14 hours.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#104:1> During the first couple of firings, the students experienced a few

problems, but they quickly learned that the loading and the placement of the

pots in the kiln were essential to the success of the firing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#105:1> Ludwig teaches a full school year and offers a short summer

program on his own time for students who want to learn more or who need to

make up work, but he still finds time to create his own art as well.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#106:1> His vigorous flash-fired vessels and low-temperature salt-fired "

parodies of pots"--watering cans that don't water, for example--have been

featured at the Daytona Beach Museum of Art, the Harris House Gallery at the

Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach, and the Albertson/Peterson

Gallery in Winter Park, Florida. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#107:1> Ludwig says working in his home pottery studio has helped him

grow as a teacher because he is enthusiastic about making pots and " students

pick up on that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#108:1> I wanted to make sure that whatever I was doing at home, I was still

carrying it back to the classroom. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#109:1> " The kids understand I'm being 'monest about what I want them to

do because I go home and practice what I preach.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#110:1> I think they sometimes have trouble believing teachers when teachers

don't practice what they preach.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#111:1> That 's not to say those aren't good teachers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#112:1> What makes a good teacher?
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#113:1> Did he/she get you the information?
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#114:1> Did you learn that information?
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#115:1> Were you then able to apply that information?
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#116:1> If a teacher can do that, then maybe that 's a good teacher.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#117:1> But I think they have to go beyond that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#118:1> A teacher has to be a role model.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#119:1> So I'm a r 'me model.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#120:1> I'm a f 'mher figure.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#121:1> I think it 's important that what I say that I do and say is really

what I do and say." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#122:1> Ludwig is a real father figure to his own two daughters,

Gretchen and Meagan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#123:1> Gretchen took his class last year to experience it from the outside.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#124:1> " So many students have stayed in touch and come to the house over

the years I think she wanted to see what it was like.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#125:1> But I don't think she has a future in pottery," he laughs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#126:1> Last year, his peers voted him Teacher of the Year--the award of

which he is most proud.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#127:1> " The best part was walking through the halls and being

congratulated by students who weren't even mine." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#128:1> It used to be that kids would pass the word to their

up-and-coming high-schooler siblings that Ludwig 's ceramics classes were the

smart scheduling choice to make.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#129:1> And with each September, the children of the children he taught

early in his career are appearing almost as frequently. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-004#130:1> " I'm w 'mking a lot harder than I've 'veer worked.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#131:1> After 24 years of teaching, you' 'dthink I' 'dhave this thing down.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#132:1> But I do not.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#133:1> I want to learn so much more, because I' 'mso involved in my work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#134:1> I' 'mexcited about it, and I want my students to be excited about it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#135:1> I think that 's one of the keys to my success with them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#136:1> I 'm going to be teaching at least another 10 years and I sure as

hell don't want to sit for that long and not progress.
<ICE-USA:W2B-004#137:1> It would be unfair to the students and to me. </p> </I>
