<ICE-USA:W2B-039#1:1> <h> The New Bionic Man Has Plastic Muscles And Silicon Senses</h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#2:1> <h> Plastic muscles and silicon senses blur the line between man and

machine.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#3:1> In a cluttered lab at the University of New Mexico, a replica of a

human skeleton slowlyvery slowlypedals an exercise bicycle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#4:1> This is no parlor trick. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#5:1> Myster Bony, as he 's called, is moving the pedals with artificial

muscles powered by a battery. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#6:1> It 's been 40 years since Swedish engineer Arne Larsson received

the first fully implanted cardiac pacemaker at the Karolinska Institute in

Stockholm.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#7:1> Since then, researchers throughout the world have looked for ways to

improve people 's lives with artificial, bionic devices.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#8:1>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#9:1>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#10:1> Their efforts have produced smaller and smaller pacemakers,

devices that help deaf children hear and implantable pumps that carry the

load for diseased hearts until suitable human transplants can be found. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#11:1> As for the future, it looks decidedly more natural than the

cyborg technology envisioned at the dawn of the bionic age.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#12:1> Take Myster Bony.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#13:1> His muscles are made of materials called ionic polymer metal

composites ( IPMCs) that respond to electricity with elasticity and

responsiveness similar to those shown by human muscles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#14:1> The materials were developed by a team led by Mohsen Shahinpoor,

director of the Artificial Muscle Research Institute ( AMRI) at the

University of New Mexico ( UNM). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#15:1> Strips of these composites can bend and flap dramatically when an

electric current is applied.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#16:1> In this sense they are large-motion actuatorsthey can move and exert

force.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#17:1> Conversely, when a strip is bent, voltage is produced across its

thickness, allowing the strip to behave like a sensor that can determine a

given level of force and motion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#18:1> These two abilitiesto move and to provide feedback drive Myster

Bony on his exercise bicycle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#19:1> All it takes is a power supply. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#20:1> Another type of artificial muscle being developed at AMRI is made

of a synthetic fiber that has been baked and boiled in a chemical solution.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#21:1> The treatment imparts strength and gives the fabric elasticity that

varies in the presence of an electric current.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#22:1> The result: materials that can expand and contract just like living

tissue. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#23:1> Researchers envision a synthetic muscle that could translate

electrical impulses from the nervous system into motion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#24:1> However, that goal is still a long way off.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#25:1> In the short term, Shahinpoor believes artificial muscles could be

used to boost the strength of ailing hearts, eliminating some heart

transplants.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#26:1> He also imagines exoskeletons for disabled patients or astronauts,

artificial larynxes, and sensors for diagnosing spinal-cord injuries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#27:1> Eventually, his synthetic muscles could be attached to artificial

tendons, which recently have been approved by the Food and Drug

Administration for use in human patients. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#28:1> <h> <bold> A Real Bionic Arm</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#29:1> Artificial muscles aren't the only electromechanical tools being

developed to facilitate human movement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#30:1> This past summer, Campbell Aird, a hotel owner in Scotland, received

a bionic arm that had been developed by the Prosthetics Research and

Development Team at Princess Margaret Rose Orthopedic Hospital in Edinburgh.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#31:1> The arm uses electronics for control and power.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#32:1> Known as EMAS ( Edinburgh Modular Arm System), the arm is equipped

with battery-powered motors and epicyclical gearboxes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#33:1> It replaced the prosthetic limb Aird had worn since his own right arm

was amputated 16 years ago as a result of cancer. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#34:1> The motors in Aird 's arm are mounted inside lightweight, rigid

tubes of carbon fiber.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#35:1> The gearboxes are connected to a worm-and-wheel assembly that

converts the mechanical power of the gearbox into rotary motion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#36:1> The smallest motors and gearboxes power fingers and the thumb, while

larger motors power the wrist, elbow and shoulder.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#37:1> The arm is covered with lifelike silicone rubber. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#38:1> David Gow, head of the team that developed the device, says EMAS

was the first prosthesis to have a fully powered electrical shoulder.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#39:1> In previous artificial arms, power had been limited to wrists, elbows

and hands.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#40:1> The arm is powered by rechargeable 12-volt batteries. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#41:1> Modern prostheses like Aird 's new arm have a wider range of

motion than ever before and look more like the limbs they're replac 're.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#42:1> Take the case of 10-year-old Melissa Del Pozzo.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#43:1> Melissa was born without a left hand and lower forearm.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#44:1> Recently, in tests at Rutgers University in New Jersey, she was able

to make electrical traces on a computer screen by moving either a tendon or a

muscle that would have been used to flex her thumb, if she had one.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#45:1> A sensor attached to the skin just below Melissa 's elbow detected the

slight movements and relayed them to the computer screen. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#46:1> Melissa will soon be outfitted with what just may be the first

dexterous prosthesis.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#47:1> To fit her with a hand and control apparatus, researchers at Rutgers'

department of biomedical engineering, in Piscataway, N. J., will fashion a

silicone sleeve equipped with pressure sensors inside.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#48:1> On top of the sleeve will sit a hard plastic socket that serves as an

exoskeleton on which to anchor the hand.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#49:1> The hand itself is a commercial wooden product used on other

prostheses.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#50:1> It is fitted with electromagnets that move each of three fingers

separately.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#51:1> When a tendon moves, the sensor, which consists of a small diaphragm,

emits a puff of air that travels through a tube to a transducer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#52:1> In turn, the transducer senses the pressure and transmits a precise

electric signal to the artificial hand. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#53:1> William Craelius, the principal researcher and an associate

professor of biomedical engineering at Rutgers, decided to focus on a

tendon-actuated system because previous teams had found it difficult to

isolate the muscle groups that can move individual fingers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#54:1> Eventually, the dexterous prosthesis may allow amputees to do such

previously impossible tasks as playing musical instruments and typing. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#55:1> <h> Powering And Control</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#56:1> Providing power to run bionic implants and making connections to

the brain 's control system pose the two great challenges for biomedical

engineering. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#57:1> In the mid-1970s, Medronics, a leading medical engineering firm,

was trying to develop a nuclear-powered heart pacemaker.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#58:1> About the same time, engineers at Drexel University in Philadelphia

maintained a dog 's heartbeat using pacemakers with a fuel cell that ran on

the electricity generated by chemical reactions between the dog 's body and a

block of aluminum.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#59:1> Neither alternative energy source proved practical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#60:1> For now, and perhaps decades to come, batteries of all shapes and

sizes will figure large in the future of bionics. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#61:1> As for controlling movement, the ultimate goal is to tap into the

nervous system.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#62:1> Researchers at the University of Michigan ( UM) Center for Neural

Communication Technology are attempting to do just that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#63:1> Here, they've de 'veoped probes so precise they can stimulate or

detect signals from individual nerve cells.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#64:1> The probes ( right) are only about the size of the date stamped on a

penny. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#65:1> The probes are made of precisely etched silicon substrates

covered with thin conductive films, and insulated above and below.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#66:1> The upper surface is patterned using a dry etching process.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#67:1> Tiny openings on the upper surface of the probe shank are inlaid with

gold or iridium, which are compatible with nerve tissue.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#68:1> These are the spots where man melds with machine. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#69:1> With sponsorship from the National Institutes of Health 's Neural

Prosthesis Program, the number of probe designs has grown and UM has provided

more than 1000 devices to investigators. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#70:1> <h> <bold> Bionic Eyes</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#71:1> One of the most dramatic applications of bionics is the creation

of artificial eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#72:1> Artificial retinas, in particular, are showing great promise.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#73:1> Researchers have long known that damaged photoreceptors in the eye

could be bypassed ( see diagram on page 55).
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#74:1> A device that stimulated the retinal ganglion cellsconnected to the

optic nervecould transmit visual information to the brain.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#75:1> Now, a new technology promises to replace the retina, allowing the

blind to see. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#76:1> Working jointly, researchers at North Carolina State University,

the University of North Carolina and Johns Hopkins University have created

the implantable Artificial Retina Component Chip ( ARCC).
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#77:1> The ARCC consists of a silicon microchip embedded with photosensor

cells and electrodes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#78:1> It would be implanted near the vision center of the retina.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#79:1> Light and images entering the pupil would pass through the ARCC 's

front surface and strike photosensors on the back of the chip.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#80:1> The photosensor array would convert the image pattern of light and

dark into electric impulses, much as a healthy eye 's rods and cones do.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#81:1> The impulses would stimulate nerves behind the retina, sending the

information to the brain. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#82:1> The device is not expected to produce full, clear vision.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#83:1> Instead, it would allow the patient to perceive basic shapes, the

direction of movements, and the boundaries between contrasting objects. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#84:1> <h> <bold> Bionic Sounds</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#85:1> Cochlear transplant research has been around since the 1950s.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#86:1> In essence, cochlear implants provide electrical stimulation of the

auditory nerve.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#87:1> The implant sends sound waves into the auditory pathway after

converting them into electrical energy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#88:1> Today, in addition to numerous research institutions developing

bionic hearing devices, several companies are already selling commercial

products.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#89:1> Although there are differences in each product, they all work

essentially the same way. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#90:1> Even in the profoundly deaf, at least one-third of the 30,000

fibers that stimulate the auditory nerve survive and are responsive, capable

of transmitting to the brain 's hearing center.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#91:1> Signals to this center are triggered by the cochlear implant. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#92:1> Unlike hearing aids, which amplify sound, the cochlear implantor

bionic eartrades in electricity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#93:1> Surgeons implant the device in the mastoid bone and inner ear through

an incision behind the ear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#94:1> A small speech processor converts sound, picked up by an external

mike, into an electrical signal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#95:1> The signal is fed through the transmitter coil to the implanted

receiver.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#96:1> Electrodes in the inner ear bypass the damaged area of the ear and

create a nerve impulse that stimulates the auditory cortex of the brain. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#97:1> Artificial cochleas will not benefit all deaf people.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#98:1> Adults who have never heard are not suitable candidates, doctors say,

because the auditory part of their brains will not respond to the stimuli.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#99:1> In an entirely different approach, Jonathan Spindel, a biomedical

engineer and assistant professor at the University of Virginia 's department

of otolaryngology, is developing an implanted " invisible" magnetic hearing

aid.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#100:1> " Our tests to date have shown that the signals produced with our

magnetic hearing device are very nearly those of natural acoustic sound,"

says Spindel. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#101:1> In this approach, the device captures sounds with a miniature

microphone implanted in the ear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#102:1> After passing through a small processing unit and an electromagnetic

coil, both also implanted, amplified vibrations would be sent to the inner

ear via a tiny magnet attached to the inner ear 's round window, a thin

membrane at one end of the cochlea.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#103:1> The magnet, about as large as a pencil point, would send vibrations

through the cochlea, stimulating the thousands of hair cells used in normal

hearing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#104:1> Spindel says an advantage of his approach is that the device

doesn't obstruct the normal hearing process.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#105:1> " Establishing a second independent input pathway to the inner ear

opens the possibility for using the normal acoustic pathway and round window

electromagnet simultaneously to establish constructive and destructive sound

patterns in the inner ear. " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#106:1> Also, since the new hearing device uses magnetic rather than

acoustic vibrations, feedbacka common problem in conventional hearing

aidsis eliminated. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#107:1> <h> <bold> Senses And Sensibilities</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#108:1> Unlike sight and hearing, scientists know little about the human

senses of smell and taste.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#109:1> Nevertheless, they have been able to re-create these abilities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#110:1> They try to mimic human noses by using sensors that can detect a

variety of volatile compounds. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#111:1> For example, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories ( ORNL), in

Oak Ridge, Tenn., a " nose on a chip" is proving able to sniff out mercury,

carbon monoxide and other chemicals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#112:1> It consists of an array of minuscule sensors on one integrated

circuit, with the electronics on a separate one.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#113:1> By selectively coating the arrays with different chemicals,

researchers can customize the chip to detect virtually any odor. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-039#114:1> At the University of Texas ( UT) in Austin, researchers have

developed an electronic tongue that mimics the human ability to detect sweet,

sour, salty and bitter tastes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#115:1> To do this, the team attached four different chemical sensors to

tiny beads made of polyethylene glycol and polystyrene.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#116:1> The beads were then positioned in micromachined wells on a silicon

wafer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#117:1> The sensors represent various combinations of the four different

taste elements with combinations of the colors red, green and blue.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#118:1> For example, when exposed to an acidic " taste" one sensor turns

yellow.
<ICE-USA:W2B-039#119:1> It becomes purple when a basic mixture is sensed. </p> </I>
