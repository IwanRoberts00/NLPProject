<ICE-USA:W2E-010#1:1> <h> IRAN - CONTRA INVESTIGATIONS - - WALSH CAN RETIRE TO LET HISTORY

SORT OUT THE LIES</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#2:1> PUBLISHERS dangling six-figure advance payments have a better

chance than independent counsel Lawrence Walsh of ferreting out the truth

about the Iran - contra coverup.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#3:1> Walsh reported to Congress last week that he had key Reagan

administration officials prepared to testify that their colleagues lied about

the arms-for-hostage deals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#4:1> This close-but-no-cigar announcement is hardly a satisfactory

conclusion for Walsh or the public.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#5:1> Walsh, a prominent Republican attorney, has spent years and perhaps

&dollar; 30 million to crack the Iran - contra scandal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#6:1> His efforts suffered legal setbacks, but the final political blow

was President George Bush 's Christmas Eve pardon of Caspar Weinberger, the

former defense secretary.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#7:1> The discovery of extensive notes by Weinberger had energized

Walsh 's inquiry.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#8:1> He indicted Weinberger for lying to Congress, and not disclosing the

contents of the detailed journals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#9:1> Weinberger 's accounts of White House meetings directly challenge

Bush 's veracity.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#10:1> In Walsh 's report to Congress, he suggested that Bush pardoned

Weinberger to spare himself a court appearance and a potentially damning

cross-examination under oath.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#11:1> Former Secretary of State George Shultz was on Walsh 's witness

list as well.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#12:1> A new book by Shultz takes Bush to task for what can only be

described in polite terms as a grievously faulty memory.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#13:1> Walsh gave it his best shot, but he was hobbled from the

beginning by a clumsy congressional investigation.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#14:1> It 's ever more apparent he faced a determined cabal of liars who had

the unlimited resources of the executive branch at their disposal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#15:1> Still, Walsh 's venue is the courtroom, not the interview, talk

show or report to Congress.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#16:1> Weinberger added a critical dimension, and his extraordinary

presidential pardon before a trial is held, let alone conviction, will have

to speak for itself.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#17:1> Walsh 's critics call for restraints on special prosecutors.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#18:1> Such a debate would be healthy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#19:1> So would a review of presidential power to pardon.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#20:1> What was once a last resort when justice had failed, has devolved

into a political escape clause.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#21:1> The truth behind the wretched Iran - contra tale will out over

time.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#22:1> Fat checks from publishers will loosen memories and inflame word

processors.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#23:1> These liars may elude the law and enrich themselves, but there is no

statute of limitations on infamy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#24:1> Time to close down shop, Mr. Walsh; nice try.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#25:1> <h> THE WEINBERGER PARDON - - DID BUSH CLOSE THE BOOK OR FEED

NATION'S DOUBTS?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#26:1> IT SEEMS strangely appropriate that one of President Bush 's last

official acts was to issue blanket pardons of Caspar Weinberger and five

co-defendants.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#27:1> By doing so he attempted to close the books on Iran - contra without

resolving his own role in that dark chapter of American political

history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#28:1> For Weinberger, the Christmas Eve release appears to be an act of

holiday generosity toward a 75-year-old man with an ailing wife and a proud

record of public service.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#29:1> Many Americans never understood the indictment and impending trial of

a former cabinet member known to have sternly opposed the ill-fated

arms-for-hostages deal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#30:1> And few Americans would complain if the pardons actually ended an

interminable investigation that has consumed six years and

&dollar; 35 million - all while focusing on what a few people did or did not know

when they testified before Congress.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#31:1> Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh 's angry remarks following the

pardons played into the hands of his critics.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#32:1> Even prominent Democrats, including Speaker Tom Foley, preferred not

to add to the political venom coming from both sides.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#33:1> But if Walsh 's zeal amounts to an abuse of the special counsel 's

mission, Bush 's pardons merely aggravate that abuse.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#34:1> Bush 's contention that the indictments amounted to " the

criminalization of policy differences" is an outrageous misrepresentation of

the case.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#35:1> Nobody, not even Walsh, accused Weinberger or any other Iran -

contra figure of disagreeing on policy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#36:1> They were accused of lying to Congress - and, by extension, to the

American people.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#37:1> Such abuse of public trust is one reason the office of the

independent counsel was created in the first place.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#38:1> Some will interpret Bush 's action as loyalty toward fellow public

servants; others as a blatant attempt to duck responsibility for his own

actions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#39:1> But the presidential pardons go far beyond holiday mercy, or even

political cronyism.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#40:1> By extending his political generosity toward the people whose public

testimony could hurt him the most, he has provided Walsh with ammunition to

carry on his public attacks.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#41:1> Bush has left the American public, and eventually historians, to

ponder the real motivation behind one of his last presidential acts.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#42:1> <h> A FAILURE TO ACT BNL-IRAQI LOAN CASE CRIES FOR INDEPENDENT

COUNSEL</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#43:1> NO presidential administration wants to investigate itself, or

surrender control if forced to submit to scrutiny.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#44:1> That hard lesson from Watergate resulted in passage of the

Independent Counsel Act in 1978.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#45:1> Congress failed to reauthorize the law this year, and the opportunity

to appoint an independent counsel to ferret out the truth about U.S.-backed

bank loans to Iraq expires on Tuesday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#46:1> Attorney General William Barr will eagerly embrace the

recommendation of a special prosecutor - his appointee - that no further

inquiry is necessary.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#47:1> The specifics of the case argue that Barr is wrong.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#48:1> The scandal focuses on the use of the Atlanta affiliate of the

Italian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro ( BNL) to funnel

&dollar; 5.5 billion in federally guaranteed loans to Iraq, and eventually to Saddam

Hussein 's secret weapons programs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#49:1> Justice Department officials have put all their emphasis on the

prosecution of the Atlanta branch manager, despite intelligence information

that Italian officials knew of his activities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#50:1> The judge presiding over the Atlanta trial has been one of the

Justice Department 's most pointed critics.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#51:1> Conservative columnist William Safire, a former Nixon speech writer,

has hammered away at the veracity and the probity of Barr and his deputies,

and the related Bush policy of coddling Hussein.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#52:1> Barr and the White House skittered away from the law with good

reason, but Congress dropped the ball.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#53:1> Buffeted by House banking and post office scandals, and Senate

ethics probes, congressional leadership was uncomfortable revising a law that

might come back to haunt them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#54:1> Election-year jitters were heightened by criticism of the long

and expensive Iran - contra investigation by independent counsel Lawrence

Walsh.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#55:1> Walsh, who has suffered court reversals because of ham-fisted

congressional inquiries, also made enemies with rumors he might be after

Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#56:1> Walsh has tried to crack a pervasive government coverup of the

Reagan-Bush scheme to trade U.S. weapons to Iran in exchange for release of

American hostages.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#57:1> A jury yesterday convicted a former CIA spy chief of lying to

Congress about Iran - contra.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#58:1> Walsh, the 11th independent counsel, could be the last, unless

Congress revives the law in January.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#59:1> The arrival of a Democratic administration may find sudden GOP

interest, after feeling a Republican-controlled White House was unduly

singled out.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#60:1> If time limits and financial accountability are needed, modify a

new independent counsel act to include them.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#61:1> The legality of this enterprise was endorsed by the Supreme Court in

1987.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#62:1> The BNL case begs for investigation.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#63:1> Congress should make it happen.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#64:1> <h> IRAN, IRAQ AND GEORGE BUSH - - FBI, CIA, JUSTICE DEPT. SNARED IN

A WEB OF LIES</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#65:1> TWENTY years after a third-rate burglary at the Watergate

complex, a first-rate bit of larceny and diplomatic double-dealing will be

investigated by a special prosecutor.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#66:1> Attorney General William Barr relented Friday under congressional

pressure and agreed to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Bush

administration 's handling of a case that involved billions in U.S.-backed

loans to Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#67:1> This scandal is so outrageous that a fight has broken out between

the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency that leaps beyond

whether anyone lied or misled Congress and a federal judge.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#68:1> That 's a given; the question is who ordered the cover-up, and where

does it start and end.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#69:1> The case and the investigation involve such deep doodoo that when

the FBI was brought in to investigate the Justice Department, the

administration and the CIA, the FBI director and his spouse were suddenly

accused of ethics violations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#70:1> The FBI was shoved on the defense as it began to focus on its

department patrons at Justice.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#71:1> The stench wafting off this scandal is the mixed aroma of

corruption and fear.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#72:1> No one wants the truth to get out about the administration

bankrolling a dictator; looks lousy on a resume.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#73:1> As President Bush fends off blows about the burgeoning Iraqgate,

his truthfulness about his role and knowledge of the Iranian arms-for-hostage

deal is under fire.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#74:1> Despite authoritative testimony and evidence to the contrary,

Bush has steadfastly denied he was aware that arms headed for the Ayatollah

Khomeini 's revolutionaries were ransom for hostages.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#75:1> This past week, Bush appeared to reverse course with a grand

revision during a morning television interview ostensibly with his wife,

Barbara Bush.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#76:1> In answer to direct, repeated questions, the president suggested that

well, of course, he knew all along the arms were ransom.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#77:1> The answers were later disavowed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#78:1> For weeks George Bush has tried to make character and probity

issues in the campaign.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#79:1> He is right.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#80:1> The American public is owed the truth about his role in two scandals

that refuse to go away.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#81:1> He is haunted by ghosts that will not rest until the truth is

out.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#82:1> Looking back, a special prosecutor had to be retained before the long

nightmare of Watergate was over.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#83:1> <h> IRAN - CONTRA SCANDAL - - CRACKING A WALL OF LIES WITH PATIENCE

AND LUCK </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#84:1> THE indictment of former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger is

the final chapter of the Iran - contra scandal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#85:1> If government investigators are correct, the high-ranking Reagan

official and his 1,700 pages of hand-written notes are a treasure trove of

inside information about illegal arms sales to Iran.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#86:1> If this case collapses, the clamor to close down the five-year

investigation will be too loud to ignore.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#87:1> Weinberger is accused of lying to Congress and making false

statements to investigators for congressional panels and Special Prosecutor

John Walsh.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#88:1> According to the indictment, Weinberger concealed the existence

of detailed diaries he kept of daily meetings and telephone calls.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#89:1> He gave the notebooks to the Library of Congress in 1987 on the

condition he controlled access to them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#90:1> The indictment challenges Weinberger 's carefully nurtured image

as an outspoken opponent of... material.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#91:1> Convictions of John Poindexter and Oliver North were overturned

out of concern their testimony under a grant of immunity before Congress was

used against them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#92:1> Two senior CIA officials were indicted last year and await trial.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#93:1> They, along with Weinberger, have no grants of... a solid walls of

lies.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#94:1> Ferreting out the truth has taken time, money and patience.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#95:1> Usually feisty Republicans in Congress, especially those on the

House Iran - contra committee, were curiously subdued following this latest

indictment.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#96:1> They want to see how this unfolds; they get a whiff of having been

played...</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#97:1> <h> U.S. TAXPAYERS GET THE BILL - - HOW BUSH POLICY HELPED IRAQ BUY,

DEVELOP ARMS</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#98:1> ... misappropriation of

&dollar; 750 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#99:1> Early Reagan administration policy tilted toward Iraq after it

invaded U.S. nemesis Iran.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#100:1> Iraq was removed from the list of nations sponsoring state

terrorism, and diplomatic relations were restored after a 17-year lapse.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#101:1> As the Iran - Iraq war dragged on, heavily indebted Iraq had

trouble borrowing money.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#102:1> Twice as vice president, Bush personally... but the administration

has fought him at every turn.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#103:1> The legal adviser to the National Security Council is refusing

to turn over documents to Congress, arguing that oral summaries are

sufficient.
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#104:1> The aroma of cover-up is strong.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#105:1> Bush does not come out of this scandal as a genius...</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-010#106:1> <h> U.S. TAXPAYERS GET THE BILL - - HOW BUSH POLICY HELPED IRAQ BUY,

DEVELOP ARMS</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#107:1> U. S. News & World Report magazine pieced together an unseemly

tale of how the Bush administration helped Saddam Hussein buy and develop

weapons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#108:1> U.S. News' findings cast a dark shadow over the president 's

reputed expertise and judgment in foreign affairs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-010#109:1> Bush and his State Department continued to raise money for

Hussein long after it was known he was guilty of gassing rebellious Kurds,

supporting terrorism, shipping arms to Lebanon and pushing hard to buy and

develop weapons.</p> </I>
