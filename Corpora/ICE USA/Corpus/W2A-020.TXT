<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#1:1> IN AMERICA we are taught from our earliest years, that upward

mobility is the essence of the American dream.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#2:1> Growing up in a white working-class family, I equated such mobility

with the " good life," " making it," and middle-class respectability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#3:1> Like many of my peers, I saw education as the key to actualizing my

vision.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#4:1> It was clear that I not only wanted to move up, but out.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#5:1> By getting a " good education" I would be able to leave my past behind

and create a life for myself which was radically different from that of my

parents. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#6:1> During those early years, my own classism prohibited me from

questioning the " dream" or the " rewards" education would bring.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#7:1> I was also unprepared for the marginality and estrangement I would

feel as my " dream" came true.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#8:1> These feelings initially surfaced during college and only intensified

as I moved up the educational hierarchy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#9:1> Thus, the more " successful" I became, the more marginal I felt. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#10:1> For many years I saw this pattern as indicative of my own

personal inadequacies rather than as a function of the ways in which my

gender and class background shaped my experience within academe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#11:1> In other words, I lacked what C. Wright Mills called the sociological

imagination, or the ability to see that my private troubles were intricately

linked to larger social forces.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#12:1> A key barrier to developing this awareness was the invisibility of

other faculty who shared my class background.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#13:1> Without the knowledge that there were others " like me," it was

difficult to move beyond a self- or victim-blaming perspective.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#14:1> It was only by breaking my self-imposed silence and sharing my

experience with others that I began to realize I was not alone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#15:1> By coming out of the closet I soon discovered that what I had viewed

as personal problems were, in fact, common struggles. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#16:1> As I spoke with other women like myself, it became clear that

these struggles were directly related to the dual nature of our class

identity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#17:1> On the one hand, we had, in many ways, become middle class.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#18:1> Our education, occupation, and income were indisputable markers that

clearly separated us from our families of origin.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#19:1> Yet our subjective experience of class was not that clear cut.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#20:1> Despite our objective position in the class structure, many of us did

not feel middle class or as if we really belonged in the world we inhabited.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#21:1> What we were keenly aware of, which many of our middle-class

colleagues failed to understand, is that " education and a good job don't

turn a black person white and they don't negate a white working-class

person 's background" ( McKenney 147).
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#22:1> As a consequence, a part of our identity was middle class while

another part remained back in the working-class world of our roots. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#23:1> Thus, as upwardly mobile working-class women, we lived in two

culturally distinct and, at times, contradictory worlds.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#24:1> One consequence of this multiple consciousness was that we often

experienced ourselves as outsiders, both within the middle-class world of

academia and within our families of origin.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#25:1> As members of what might be best described as a transition class, we

saw ourselves as living on the margins of two cultural worlds but as members

of neither.1 </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#26:1> We also felt that this sense of marginality was augmented further

by our gender.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#27:1> As women, we were well aware of our anomalous position within an

institution whose structure and ideology reinforced patriarchal values.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#28:1> As a consequence, we frequently saw ourselves as outside the

mainstream of university life, alienated and invisible.2 </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#29:1> In this chapter 1 examine the personal and professional struggles

faced by female academics from the working class as they try to cope with

their marginal status and the psychic disequilibrium created by upward

mobility.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#30:1> Given the dearth of literature on this topic, I will draw on my

experiences and those shared with me by other women faculty.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#31:1> Like myself, these women are white and all are in their mid-thirties

to early forties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#32:1> The ambiguities and ambivalences with which we are most familiar

shape the central themes of this chapter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#33:1> How these themes might differ for male academics from the working

class, or for other racial and age groups, are issues that remain to be

explored. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#34:1> Central to any discussion of social class is the profound effect

it has on our perception of the world as well as of our place in it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#35:1> When we identify ourselves as being in one class or another, we are

making a statement about what we view as our objective position within the

class structure.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#36:1> However, class is more than an abstract category or benign label

assigned to self or others.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#37:1> Each class has a distinctive social51 existence, a culture that

creates a sense of belonging among its members ( Ryan and Sackrey 107).
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#38:1> This culture shapes how we speak, walk, dress, eat, our sense of

control over our life, our values and attitudes regarding work, family,

intimacy, money, leisure, and education.3 </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#39:1> Within American society, however, each class culture is not

equally valued.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#40:1> Specifically, the norm, the standard of acceptability and

respectability, is middle class.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#41:1> Thus, to be from the working class is to be defined as " less than,"

inferior, subordinate.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#42:1> As many feminists have noted, this pattern of responding not only to

class but to all human differences in dualistic and hierarchical terms

characterizes much of Western thought.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#43:1> Representing what may be called a patriarchal consciousness, this

mode of thinking " conditions us to see human differences in simplistic

opposition to each other: dominant/subordinate, good/bad, up/down,

superior/inferior" ( Lorde 114).
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#44:1> Within this framework, those who lack privilege and power become "

other," the outsider whose experience is ignored, devalued, or erased.4 </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#45:1> For members of the working class and other subordinate groups,

this reductive response to human differences often leads to internalized

oppression.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#46:1> This refers to the " incorporation and acceptance by individuals

within an oppressed group of the prejudices against them within the dominant

society" ( Pheterson 148).
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#47:1> And, as Pheterson notes, internalized oppression is likely to be

associated with feelings of inferiority, self-hatred, self-concealment, and

isolation ( 148). </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#48:1> What are the consequences of these cultural patterns for

academics from the working class?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#49:1> First, they strongly affect how such faculty perceive themselves and

their place within the academy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#50:1> Given the middle-class values and assumptions that permeate

university life, academics from the working class are constantly aware of

their differences from the norm.5 The taken-for-granted reality that "

everyone is middle class" typically structures the curriculum as well as

conversations with colleagues and administrators.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#51:1> Within this environment, it is not surprising that, as Ryan and

Sackrey learned, working-class faculty often view themselves as outsiders or

as marginal members of the academy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#52:1> For female academics from the working class, this sense of not

belonging is augmented further by the masculinist culture and male-centered

nature of the university.6 Well aware of their outsider status, both as women

and as members of a culturally devalued class, many silence themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#53:1> While this strategy enables them to " pass" as middle.52 class or

appear as an insider to others, " passing" is not the same as belonging.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#54:1> Thus, silence may protect working-class faculty from being "

discovered" by others, but it does not eradicate their cultural heritage anti

the feelings of estrangement that stem from it. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#55:1> Second, due to internalized oppression, working-class faculty may

be more likely than their middle-class colleagues to have serious doubts

about their self-worth, skills, and ability to perform or succeed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#56:1> Objective evidence of professional success often does little to

ameliorate these doubts and, in fact, frequently has the opposite effect.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#57:1> This theme is aptly illustrated by the following experience shared

with me by a well-known women s studies scholar Although she had published

five books, she experienced a great deal of difficulty completing and

submitting the final draft of each one.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#58:1> In her words, she feared " letting go" of her work because she knew

this would ultimately lead to her being " judged by others and put on trial.?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#59:1> Though her work was always well received, each time she neared the

completion of a new book, she would begin to define her past successes as a

fluke; she had just gotten " lucky.?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#60:1> This time, however, it would be different.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#61:1> Her ultimate fear would become a reality.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#62:1> Others would finally discover who she <it> really </it> was: " a

working-class kid who managed to con everyone into believing she was good

enough, smart enough, and so forth.?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#63:1> Although she always managed to overcome this fear and submit her work

for publication, doubts regarding her self-worth remained.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#64:1> Accordingly, whenever a new challenge or project arose, the cycle

would repeat itself. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#65:1> The fear that others will discover one is a fraud or impostor is

quite common among first-generation professionals, including academics from

the working class.7 Having internalized the classism of the larger culture,

such faculty may find it difficult to accept praise from others and they

often deny their own competence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#66:1> Accordingly, they attribute success to external events such as luck

rather than to personal skill or ability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#67:1> Ironically, as their professional achievements increase,

working-class faculty may feel more than ever that others have a false

impression of them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#68:1> And, this in turn, can heighten their fear of being " discovered."

</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#69:1> Another issue that may arise concerns the symbolic meaning of

one 's work or professional success. For often what is defined as " success"

within the middle-class world of academia becomes yet another manifestation

of separateness and alienation from the working-class world of one 's roots.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#70:1> Accordingly, the more one succeeds, the greater53 the social distance

from one 's class of origin.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#71:1> Given this dynamic, there is often a desire for and simultaneous fear

of such " success" among working-class faculty.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#72:1> This double bind can lead to confusion and ambivalence regarding what

others in academe take for granted as indicators of professional success (

e.g., completing a dissertation, publishing, receiving tenure).
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#73:1> Working-class academics may therefore experience more difficulty

reaching professional goals than their middle-class colleagues.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#74:1> And, once achieved, such success can raise new existential dilemmas.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#75:1> This theme, as well as the class-based contradictions associated with

academic success, has emerged repeatedly in my conversations with others.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#76:1> For example, during a recent conference, I heard a working-class

faculty member discuss her response to receiving tenure.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#77:1> For years she had thought this rite of passage would mark the

beginning of a new life.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#78:1> Self-doubt and anxiety would no longer characterize her experience

within academe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#79:1> After all, she would have " made it" and finally proven herself She

soon discovered, however, that tenure was a mixed blessing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#80:1> It secured her place within the middle-class world of academe, but by

doing so, raised a plethora of new questions: Was she now one of " them"?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#81:1> Had she finally become a full-fledged member of the educated elite, a

group her family referred to with disdain, yet often admired and wanted to

emulate?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#82:1> Had she betrayed those she left behind?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#83:1> Would her newly won status separate her even more from her family of

origin?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#84:1> What <it> did </it> this rite of passage mean in terms of her

self-definition?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#85:1> As I listened to her remarks, I remembered having similar thoughts

while writing my dissertation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#86:1> In fact, these thoughts were a large part of why I feared completing

it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#87:1> Thus, for working-class academics, whether beginning or at later

stages of their careers, professional success can create identity confusion

as well as heighten feelings of estrangement. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-020#88:1> The feelings of marginality and alienation experienced by

working-class faculty within the academy may also permeate their

relationships with significant others from their past, particularly family

members.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#89:1> As one interviewee in a recent study of working-class academics

noted: " Years of living a university life have isolated me from my working

class origins.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#90:1> What do we have in common, what can we talk about?
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#91:1> Their interests are not my interests, their values are no longer

mine" ( Ryan and Sackrey 138).
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#92:1> Given the centrality of kin in working-class culture, such isolation

can create a great deal of anguish.8 In addition, 54 because women tend to

define themselves in more relational terms than men, estrangement from kin

may be particularly difficult for female academics from the working class.9

Such women learn very early in their careers that their life-style, general

interests, and work are largely incomprehensible to their families.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#93:1> Although family members may try to understand this " new" life, the

pain is, in many ways, that they can't.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#94:1> Attempts to explain one 's life-style and work often only broaden the

chasm and, in the end, it becomes painfully clear that they are living in

radically different worlds from one another.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#95:1> For example, during a recent conversation with my mother, I began

discussing a conference I planned to attend on the West Coast.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#96:1> She immediately asked what people did at a conference and I explained

that they present their ideas and talk about them with others.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#97:1> She then asked whether I knew any of the people who would be there

and I said a few, but that hundreds would be attending.
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#98:1> Her response: " You mean to tell me that you are going to travel

three thousand miles to talk to people you don't even know?"
<ICE-USA:W2A-020#99:1> I meekly replied " yes." </p> </I>
