<ICE-USA:W2C-011#1:1> <h> Artzt 's pay down - - to

&dollar;2.06 million: But after subtracting special ' 91 bonus, P&G chief 's

compensation climbed 11%</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#2:1> Procter & Gamble Co.Chairman Edwin L. Artzt 's pay fell 29% to just

more than

&dollar;2 million for the year ended June 30, largely because of how the company

awards special bonuses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#3:1> Including salary, bonus and other compensation, A&percent;tzt collected

&dollar; 2.06 million in the most recent fiscal year, versus

&dollar; 2&percent;9 million a year earlier, according to a P&G document released

Wednesday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#4:1> Minus a

&dollar;1 million-plus special bonus paid in September, 1991, however, Artzt 's pay

was up 11%, compared with the prior year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#5:1> Artzt and several other top P&G executives received the special

bonuses in fiscal 1992 as a reward for exceeding profit goals for the three

years ended June 30, 1991.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#6:1> Accordin&percent; to the proxy statement for P&G 's Oct. 12 annual meeting,

Artzt got a base salary last year of about

&dollar; 1.14 million, a

&dollar; 625,000 bonus and other compensation of about

&dollar; 300,000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#7:1> In addition, the chairman and chief executive received restricted

stock worth a value of those holdings to about

&dollar; 3.2 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#8:1> Artzt also owned another 347,000 shares of P&G 's common stock at

the end of the year, with a current value of about

&dollar; 17 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#9:1> By comparison, P&G sales increased 4% to

&dollar; 30.4 billion for fiscal 1993, while earnings--less special charges--rose

11% to

&dollar; 2.1 billion.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#10:1> Part of the charges are tied to P&G 's plans to cut 12%, or about

13,000, of its jobs and clos&percent; 20% of its plants.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#11:1> <h> The proxy also disclosed: </h>

<&percent;> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#12:1> * President John E. Pepper made a base salary of

&dollar; 835,000, the &percent;ame as a year earlier, while his bonus slipped&percent;from

&dollar; 756,600 to

&dollar; 415,000 for the year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#13:1> In all, he received about

&dollar; 1.5 million in salary, bonus and other compensation, down 35% from

&dollar; 2.27 million a year earlier.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#14:1> Without an earlier special bonus of

&dollar; 456,000, Pepper 's pay fell 19%.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#15:1> * Durk Jager, exe&percent;utive vice president, received

&dollar; 1.01 million, a 19% decrease from

&dollar; 1.25 million ( including a

&dollar; 391,00&percent; special bonus) a year earlier.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#16:1> Excluding the bonus, his pay increased 17%.</p>

<&percent;> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#17:1> * Executive Vice President Gerald V. Dirvin got

&dollar; 957,000, a 28% decline from

&dollar; 1.32 million ( including a

&&percent;ollar; 400,000 special bonus) a year earlier.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#18:1> Excluding the bonus, his pay gre&percent; 4%.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#19:1> * Group Vice President Harald Einsmann received

&dollar; 995,000, down 36% from

&dollar;1.55 million ( i&percent;cluding a

&dollar; 360,000 special bonus) a year earlier.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#20:1> Excluding the bonus,&percent;his pay fell 17%.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#21:1> P&G noted that the executives might still make more for fiscal

1993, since some of the&percent;r bonus money has not yet been calculated.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#22:1> <h> F&C to sell Canadian business</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#23:1> Cincinnati flavor-maker F&C International Inc. has agreed to sell

its Canadian subsidiary, including its snack seasonings business, to an Irish

food company for up to

&dollar; 7.7 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#24:1> The sale agreement, subject to a public auction slated for Sept.

22, would be the largest asset sale in F&C 's effort to emerge from bankruptcy

reorganization.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#25:1> Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#26:1> Wednesday granted F&C 's request to expedite the sale of the Canadian

business to Kerry Ingredients of Canada, a unit of Kerry Group plc, subject

to creditor objections.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#27:1> The base purchase price is

&dollar; 3.4 million but could rise to

&dollar;7.7 million if Kerry buys the subsidiary 's inventory and receivables.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#28:1> If none of F&C 's creditors object, the company plans to go ahead

with the auction in New York City, a move which could draw other bidders.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#29:1> Frank Budetti, F&C 's chief executive officer, said the Canadian

business isn't part of F&C 's bankruptcy, so the sale doesn't require Aug 's

approval.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#30:1> But court approval will speed the sale, Budetti said, allowing F&C to

repay some debts and trim about

&dollar; 75,000 in loan fees due Star Bank.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#31:1> In a related development, Jon P. Fries, F&C 's fired chairman, has

asked Aug to lift the automatic stay on suits against F&C while it 's in

bankruptcy reorganization so he can renew his suit against F&C in Hamilton

County Common Pleas Court.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#32:1> F&C, once a hot stock on Wall Street, was forced to seek

Bankruptcy reorganization April 19, just two weeks after firing Fries and

Disclosing inventory discrepancies estimated at up to

&dollar; 8 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#33:1> F&C, also the target of a Securities and Exchange Commission

probe, filed suit against Fries, claiming he " directed and acquiesced" in

the inventory fraud.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#34:1> Fries denied those charges and filed a

&dollar; 7.7 million suit against F&C claiming the company violated his employment

agreement and slandered him.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#35:1> That suit was withdrawn because of the automatic stay, D. Jeffrey

Ireland, Fries' attorney, said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#36:1> But Ireland said Fries' suit won't jeopardize F&C 's reorganization,

and he thinks that relief from the stay is merited.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#37:1> <h> F&C TO OPPOSE FRIES </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#38:1> Aug has set a hearing on Fries' request for Oct. 5.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#39:1> Budetti said the company would oppose Fries' request.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#40:1> Budetti said the proceeds from the sale of the Canadian business

will reduce F&C 's debt to Star Bank to less than

&dollar; 8 million, down from

&dollar;17.5 million in June.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#41:1> Previously, F&C sold its New Jersey fragrance business for

&dollar;4.7 million and its Hong Kong subsidiary for

&dollar; 800,000.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-011#42:2> <H> Alternative banking: Local bankers scramble to offer new services

and offset growth in non-banking options</H>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#43:2> Greater Cincinnati banks are putting more emphasis on offering

new services and products to a vital part of their customer base:

individuals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#44:2> With interest rates at their lowest levels in more than 20 years,

yields on traditional saving vehicles such as certificates of deposit ( CDs)

and passbook savings accounts no longer provide retail customers the best

return for their money.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#45:2> Responding to that trend, depositors have been pouring money

primarily into stocks, bonds or mutual funds in search of better returns.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#46:2> Local banks--particularly the larger ones--are fighting back by

offering customers alternative products and services ranging from telephone

banking to mutual funds to branch banking in stores.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#47:2> Banks are offering alternatives largely because low rates have

cut yields on traditional deposits and are driving away individual customers,

said Fritz Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association, an

Arlington, Va.-based trade group.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#48:2> " This is something that will not be temporary, but a course for

those regularly willing to take the risk uninsured products with higher

yields than FDIC-insured banking products, Elmendorf said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#49:2> So have elderly customers, particularly those nearing retirement

and relying on higher-yielding investments as part of their income.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#50:2> The shift actually began about two years ago, as interest rates

dropped and consumers sought higher yields.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#51:2> According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., investments in

rate-sensitive deposits like CDs at banks totaled

&dollar;845 billion, or 32%, of all deposits as of March, 1993, down from
&percent;
&dollar; 970 billion, or 36%, of all deposits as of March, 1992.</p>&percent;
<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#52:2> CD investments have plunged with their rates: By the end of 1992,

one-year CDs were paying less an 3%, with 2-1/2-year CDs at about 3.5% and
&percent;
five-year CDs at 4.75%, a recent &percent;ank Rate Monitor survey showe&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#53:2> That compares with rates of 7% or more just two years ago.
<ICE-USA:W2&percent;-011#54:2> In contrast, the amount of money in stock, bond and money market

funds; grew to an all-time high of

&dollar; 1.847 trillion as of July, 1993, up 20% from

&dollar; 1.539 trillion i&percent; July, 1992, and 50% from

&dollar;1.227 tril&percent;ion in July, 1991.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#55:2> The growth made those products some of the nation 's biggest

collectors of money after bank and insurance companies, Investment Company

Institute, a Washington-based trade group, said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#56:2> Sales of stock and bond funds alone accounted for much of the

growth, rising 33% during the first se&percent;en months of 1993 to

&dollar; 156.5 billion from

&dollar; 117.3 billion at the end of 1992, the institute said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#57:2> Banks across the nation have responded with efforts to build-or

rebuild--their retail banking business.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#58:2> Among the actions banks are taking to keep or draw back

depositors:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#59:2> * Offering alternative investments such as tax-exempt stocks and

bonds, as well as annuities, that offer higher yields.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#60:2> * Adding bank branches to such sites as grocery stores to

increase deposits and loans.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#61:2> * Training employees to handle a variety of customers' needs,

instead of shuffling customers through several departments.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#62:2> " You'll con 'llue to see an accelerated pace of banks acting more

like retailers," Phillip A. Parker, executive vice president at Star Bank,

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#63:2> " We have to be like Saks or Lazarus and do things to bring people in

the bank".</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#64:2> Working from that philosophy, Greater Cincinnati banks are

Implementing several options to maintain and increase their number of

depositors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#65:2> Star, for example, has introduced new products such as mutual

funds, discount brokerage services and annuities to protect its No.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#66:2> 2 ranking in the local retail banking market, Parker said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#67:2> Star also is considering opening its first bank branches in

grocery stores in Greater Cincinnati, Parker said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#68:2> That strategy has worked well for Star in northern Ohio, where

the bank has opened five such branches since May.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#69:2> The result: Consumers have opened about 1,000 new accounts at those

branches and poured in

&dollar; 2.5 million worth of deposits, Parker said.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#70:2> <h> MORE IN STORE? </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#71:2> Provident Bank also is eyeing in-store banking, having recently

opened a branch at a Thriftway grocery store in Fairfield, local bank

executives said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#72:2> Local bankers are watching Provident 's moves in that arena

closely, wondering whether the bank will be able boost its No.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#73:2> 2 position in the retail banking market by entering more of

Thriftway 's 24 local stores.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#74:2> Provident and Thriftway aren't talking, however; executives at both

firms did not return calls seeking comment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#75:2> PNC Bank Ohio/Northern Kentucky is preparing to launch new

products, Executive Vice President Dennis P. Brenckle said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#76:2> Among them: The bank is testing ways to add such services as

check cashing to its automated teller machine ( ATM) network and recently

upgraded its regional marketing centers in Greater Cincinnati.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#77:2> Those centers give customers the option of buying several products at

one site.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#78:2> " It 's great to be part of this concept because you have many

more resources that you can refer customers to," Jenea Norris Allen, a

residential loan officer at PNC 's downtown office, said.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#79:3> <h> HOUSE BANKING </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#80:3> Fifth Third Bank, the leader in local retail banking, has beefed

up its retail business with an in-home banking option, P. Michael Brumm,

senior vice president and chief financial officer, said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#81:3> By using the bank 's Jeanie ATM network, Fifth Third customers can pay

bills over the phone.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#82:3> In addition, Fifth Third this summer began offering a product

called Ohio Tax Free Bond.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#83:3> The fund allows investors to receive income from tax-free bonds sold

by schools and municipalities, providing them with higher yields than other

savings products.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#84:3> Fifth Third also will continue working with Kroger Co. to build

its retail business, Brumm said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#85:3> The bank, now with about 30 Kroger branches, will add as the grocery

chain updates its area stores.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#86:3> " We'l 'llontinue putting emphasis on giving customers what they

they want it," Brumm said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#87:3> Society Bank, meanwhile, has formed Society Investments to offer

customers non-traditional products, Frank L. Collins, senior vice president

of retail administration, said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#88:3> Among its products: mutual funds, tax-exempt stocks and bonds, and

annuities that offer a guaranteed yield over a certain period.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#89:3> " We have to continue responding to customers' needs and offer

clients alternative investments," Collins said.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#90:3> <h> DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#91:3> Banks are likely to continue their search for ways to bring

consumers new products as long as interest rates remain low, local bankers

and industry experts said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#92:3> Parker, of Star Bank, predicted that bankers will become "

relationship managers" for individual customers, selling everything from

conventional services to insurance policies and travel-related products.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#93:3> Someday soon, for instance, banks might offer special rates on

CDs to win more of a consumer 's business, whether it 's for financial

management or discount brokerage services or other products.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-011#94:3> " Consumers want a lot of things from banks and we 'll have to be

more flexible to give them they want," Parker said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-011#95:3> " If we don't, we face the risk of losing their business."</p> </I>
