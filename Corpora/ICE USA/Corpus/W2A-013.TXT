<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#1:1> In 1966, on the occasion of the centenary of Adolph Meyer 's birth,

Theodore Lidz delivered the Meyer lecture, entitling it " Adolf Meyer and the

Development of American Psychiatry" ( 1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#2:1> He concluded the published version of the paper by saying, " In

commemorating him, we can do much for ourselves and for psychiatry by

recognizing and utilizing the heritage he left us.?
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#3:1> Analogously, in 1980 John Neill reviewed Meyer 's contributions in a

paper on " Adolf Meyer and American Psychiatry Today" ( 2).
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#4:1> He stated, " Meyer 's times were similar to ours in many ways.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#5:1> In a curious fashion our professional wheel has come full circle to

where it was in 1900, and we are again in need of the Meyerian spirit, a

holistic perspective.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#6:1> Acquainting ourselves with the wisdom in his legacy is an important

first step on the journey forward.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#7:1> In the 1985 Adolf Meyer lecture, Michael Rutter ( 3) pointed out the

relevance of Meyer 's work to major current issues in psychiatry.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#8:1> His paper, entitled " Meyerian Psychobiology Personality Development,

and the Role of Life Experiences," clearly enunciated the fundamental

implications of the psychobiological concept.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#9:1> In this paper, I wish to follow my eminent predecessors but also to

delineate in my own way how a reexamination of these Meyerian concepts might

point the way toward the next turning point in American psychiatry.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#10:1> Indeed, I perceive subtle signs of the early phases around which the

next stage might coalesce, and I anticipate that by the beginning of the

twenty-first century, the developmental lines will be much clearer. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#11:1> To be the Medical Director of APA is in itself a remarkable

honor, and I have consistently relished the opportunity to be part of the

profession 's adaptation to new forces from within and outside of its changing

boundaries.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#12:1> Lidz stated that " Adolf Meyer virtually identified himself with

psychiatry"(1), and I empathize with that position as long as it is

understood that I have also maintained the differentiation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#13:1> Of late I have noted the tendency ( not yet a symptom) to

reminisce and reflect about the broader sweep of events; indeed, I have been

a participant and observer in remarkable changes in our field.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#14:1> In this paper I wish to review some of these events with emphasis

upon the post-World War II changes that have been part of my personal

experience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#15:1> The scientific program of APA 's 1989 annual meeting is an excellent

symbol of our current status--quite different from the symbols and substance

of the meetings of a quarter of a century ago.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#16:1> In this paper, I wish to highlight four turning points: 1) the rise

of Meyerian psychobiology and its peak impact in the second quarter of the

twentieth century, 2) the dominance of divergent therapeutic ideologies,

including the important impact of psychoanalysis in the post-World War 11

years, 3) the current surge of neuroscience and psychopharmacology along with

empiricism and logical positivism, 4) a predicted reemergence of analogues of

Meyerian psychobiology at the turn of the twenty-first century accompanied by

a) a new systematized psychobiology of coping, of adaptation, and of active

efforts by persons to deal with multileveled stresses, b) an increased

knowledge base in life course transactions converting the elaborate Meyerian

history taking system to a more dynamic and relevant process, c) a trend

toward a new nosological system that will give life and greater utility to

the current axis IV and V systems ( <it> DSM-III </it> and <it> DSM-III-R

</it> ) and will deal more effectively with the boundaries between health and

disorder, d) with a, b, and c ( coping life history, and boundaries between

health and illness) and accompanied by appropriate professional leadership,

the reemergence of a vital new clinical psychiatry, e) a more balanced

overall approach using psychoanalytic, social psychiatric, and biological

concepts that have become clear enough to test empirically, and f) a more

rational therapeutic system emphasizing new combinations and transactions

between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy--along with a new generation of

educators experienced in these combinations. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#17:1> <h> THE RISE OF MEYERIAN PSYCHOBIOLOGY AND ITS PEAK IMPACT IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#18:1> I entered psychiatry in the decade after World War ll.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#19:1> The winds of change had already altered the psychiatric landscape,

and almost all of my clinical supervisors and teachers espoused the new "

dynamic psychiatry.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#20:1> The textbooks of psychiatry, however, were still dominated strongly

by the prewar developments, and my introduction to Adolf Meyer was announced

primarily by written words rather than by clinical interactions and case

conferences or personal contact.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#21:1> In retrospect, I understand that this was unfortunate because it was

not easy to grasp Meyer 's ideas from his written words alone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#22:1> Henderson 4) said that " Adolf Meyer had to surmount language

difficulties affecting his speech and his writing which made it far from easy

to get his meaning and rendered his ideas more obscure than they really

were.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#23:1> Ebaugh ( 5) , commenting on the same subject, stated that " It was

frequently difficult to grasp the full import of Dr. Meyer 's formulations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#24:1> It was his tendency to be elliptical or to verbalize incomplete

thoughts which meandered in the direction of his own special interest of the

moment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#25:1> This may account, In part, for the fact that his theories are not

fully recorded, or are, at best, inadequately understood.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#26:1> ( It is hoped that late twentieth-century technology will afford

subsequent generations an opportunity to learn ten words.)
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#27:1> Over time, however, I have become increasingly knowledgeable about

the basic tenets of Meyer 's ideas and understand better what a pervasive

influence he exerted.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#28:1> Even more important for me, I began to understand why his ideas were

so important.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#29:1> It is hoped that others will find it rewarding to make their own

judgments on this matter. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#30:1> On several occasions, Meyer sketched his own perception of the

historical phases of psychiatry in the United States ( 6).
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#31:1> He tended to call the first phase " the time of the Thirteen,"

honoring the founders of APA.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#32:1> He then described the second phase as " the preoccupation with the

brain ( a mere word with most) as the palpable issue in the disorder, when

the workers actually looked for new emphases and concrete methods having to

regulate complex organismal wholes, and the rising of competition from

outside after the Civil War.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#33:1> That prototypic Meyerian description, with all of its ambiguity, lies

at the heart of his concerns, namely, that the biological reductionism in the

late nineteenth century was, at least in part, a defensive maneuver against

the influx of immigrants into the United States.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#34:1> The " moral psychiatry" of the earlier part of the nineteenth century

was fine with Yankee patients and doctors but somehow less appropriate with

postindustrial America.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#35:1> In characterizing a third phase of American psychiatry from the 1890s

to World War 1, Meyer essentially described a period of increased

systematization of research, followed by a fourth phase that was a

description of some of his hopes and aspirations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#36:1> Meyer highlighted the development of special psychiatric centers (

research oriented institutes) that could be models for an advancing science

of psychiatry.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#37:1> His thoughts about psychosomatic processes and psychiatry 's role in

medicine were enunciated with emphasis upon " the person" and strong

criticism of dualism and reductionism. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#38:1> From the late twentieth century vantage point, the nuances of

changes in the first part of this century are overshadowed by a dominant

trend symbolized by Meyer himself.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#39:1> Indeed, the turning point that peaked in the second quarter of this

century can be characterized as a gradual shift from the prior biological

reductionism and its attendant practices and value systems to a phase where

clinical psychiatry took on new aspirations, new methods, and new interests.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#40:1> While Meyer characterized his major approach as psychobiology, his

personal style reflected the biopsychosocial model as enunciated much later

by Engel ( 7).
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#41:1> When finally ensconced in his pivotal professorship at Johns Hopkins

( Phipps Clinic), Meyer maintained a profound interest in clinical practice,

carried out experimental procedures in the anatomical laboratories adjacent

to his office, became the preeminent educator of the psychiatric leaders of

the next generation, and continuously served as an ardent advocate of

community programs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#42:1> Simultaneously, he collaborated with leaders in other clinical

departments to develop psychosomatic programs ( including liaison activities)

and also kept abreast of larger philosophic, social, and political events.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#43:1> Keeping abreast was not an extraneous abstraction but involved

friendship and collaboration with an impressive array of scholars,

politicians, and moral philosophers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#44:1> It is likely, of course, that American psychiatry would have

changed direction even without Meyer, but its contour and evolution were

deeply influenced by him.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#45:1> It took a very special leader, however, to effect a turning of

psychiatry toward a new direction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#46:1> His solid biological roots gave special credence to his emphasis upon

the patient as a person; simultaneously, his interest in social and community

phenomena could not be brushed away as irrelevant abstractions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#47:1> Kraepelin and his American counterparts had been challenged by a

worthy critic who shook the lugubrious roots of the concept of dementia

praecox.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#48:1> S. Wei Mitchell 's 1894 challenge ( 8) to psychiatry to solidify its

scientific and medical foundations was being answered by a leader with

impeccable medical and scientific credentials.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#49:1> A mood of hope and of increasing capacity to cope with the enormous

problems began to spread through the new scientific and academic institutes

created by Meyer and his students.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#50:1> Many of these students became the directors and chairs of the major

psychiatric departments across the country and also overseas.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#51:1> As they began to confront the many issues, however, progress was not

easy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#52:1> Hundreds of thousands of patients were housed in deteriorating

institutions; treatment techniques and methods were unspecific; and the

number of trained practitioners was much too small for the demands upon them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#53:1> Just as the first rays of light began to seep through the end of the

tunnel, World War 11 occurred and American psychiatry became absorbed in a

momentous maelstrom that challenged many fundamental tenets. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#54:1> <h> THE DOMINANCE OF DIVERGENT THERAPEUTIC IDEOLOGIES INCLUDING THE

IMPORTANT IMPACT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS IN THE POST-WORLD WAR 11 YEARS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#55:1> World War II produced massive upheavals beyond the preemptive

political and military events that changed the future course of history.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#56:1> In the wake of larger changes, old boundaries and barriers between

nations became more permeable so that both people and ideas moved from one

part of the world to another.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#57:1> The movement included the emigration of brilliant psychoanalysts to

Western Europe, the United States, and Canada. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#58:1> For American psychiatry these events precipitated significant

qualitative changes that have been well documented in many excellent

publications.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#59:1> In this paper I wish to emphasize a few aspects of these changes,

which, at least m part, have not been emphasized enough. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#60:1> The large number of American psychiatric casualties among our

troops had riveted public attention to what began to be understood as a

serious national problem.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#61:1> Wide publicity about new techniques to deal with traumatic neuroses,

as developed by an able cadre of military psychiatrists, also had a

significant impact.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#62:1> ( I was fortunate enough to work for many years with Roy Grinker [ 9]

and learned much about those heady days. ) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#63:1> What I wish to emphasize in this paper is that all of these

postwar changes were engrafted upon the predisposing tendencies engendered

during the Meyerian turning point.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#64:1> The uncompleted psychobiological revolution had opened new

possibilities to concentrate upon the person and upon the individual clinical

case.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#65:1> Biological psychiatry had not met the earlier challenges fully and

gradually began to feel isolated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#66:1> The dawn of a more concentrated effort at social and community

psychiatry had been encouraged by Meyer himself.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#67:1> Most Important, Meyer had directly and indirectly supported the

development of psychoanalysis in the United States; but by the early 1950s

psychoanalysis superseded psychobiology and in fact paid only cursory

attention to it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-013#68:1> In some quarters ( Sargant [ 10] in the United Kingdom, among

others) it was believed that psychoanalysis had taken over United States

psychiatry lock, stock, and barrel.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#69:1> This perception was incorrect because, in fact, it overlooked

competing ideologies ( e.g., in social and biological psychiatry) that

frequently challenged psychoanalysis, adding to the siege mentality that

consistently pervaded the field.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#70:1> Nevertheless, psychoanalysis developed enormous academic

institutional power and affected significant hospitals, associations, and

their leaders.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#71:1> Equally, perhaps even more important, ideas and practices throughout

the field were profoundly influenced.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#72:1> Repeatedly, I have emphasized one change that is only beginning to be

understood by decision makers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#73:1> Psychoanalysis altered the boundaries of psychiatry radically in

terms of its implicit definition of psychopathology and its implicit concepts

of what psychiatrists should do and should not do.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#74:1> <it> Freud 's Psychopathology of Everyday Life </it> ( 11), in the

context of his brilliantly written clinical examples and structural concepts,

led to an assumption of the near universality of psychopathology.
<ICE-USA:W2A-013#75:1> When psychoanalytic theory was coupled with equally profound changes

in child and adolescent psychiatry, the world of nosology was given a

near-mortal wound. </p> </I>
