<ICE-USA:W2A-016#1:1> <h> <bold> ABSTRACT: </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#2:1> This paper argues that postmodernism represents a contemporary

manifestation of a long-standing political despair among Western

intellectuals.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#3:1> It shows commonality with various " Power-conflict" perspectives of

the past, as well as associated connections with well-known theses of " Post-

industrialism."
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#4:1> The strength of the postmodernism partly rests on gaps in Marxist

historical theory.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#5:1> In its identification of several g stance of postmodernism the end,

however, the fundamental fails because of its dematerialization of symbols

and their exchange.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#6:1> Postmodern social theory is thus understood as no more than a mode of

Idealist philosophy, a status that renders it essentially useless as a basis

for social change and that places it in the camp of political reaction. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#7:1> Much of the Marxist critique of postmodernism has been refutory in

its intent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#8:1> The remainder has searched for emancipatory sub-texts within the

largely reactionary text of its major proponents ( see Rosenau [ 19921 for a

comprehensive, ordered list of various Marxist responses to the encounter

with postmodernism).
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#9:1> Both these approaches are limited in their ability to generate an

adequate understanding of postmodernism as a phenomenon per se and, yet more

problematic for Marxist theory, are insufficient as an analysis of the

changing social and political reality from which this complex ideational

outcropping has emerged.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#10:1> Although there have been a number of attempts to situate

postmodernism in a class-historical conjuncture ( see Norris [ 19901 for an

interesting exam le), these have tended to cede the home-court advantage to

postmodernism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#11:1> That is, the conceptual assertions of postmodernism have been parsed

for their internal consistency and thus have been treated as linguistic

events exhibiting legitimacy from the outset, rather than being examined as

ideological outcroppings of an underlying social reality that may or may not

function as postmodernism portrays it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#12:1> More simply and in the main, Marxists have evaluated postmodernism

textually, not scientifically.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#13:1> While this is perfectly acceptable and consistent from the

deconstructive, text-centered stance of postmodernism, it is unacceptable and

inconsistent from a materialist position.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#14:1> It is thus a recapitulation of the error of the Young Hegelian

criticism of religion and theology as modes of Idealism that Marx criticized

in <it> Toward a Critique of Hegel 's " Philosophy of Right" </it> - i.e., the

concentration on the " aroma" of the socially problematic, rather than social

contradictions themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#15:1> Unless one posits that the word precedes reality, which neither

Marxism nor any other form of materialism does, the referential meaning of

words must be subject to intense scrutiny.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#16:1> Indeed, the primary vulnerability of postmodernism is to materialism

in general, and only secondarily and by inheritance to Marxism, as its most

developed incarnation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#17:1> As Baudrillard ( 1975) clearly understood in ideological practice in

<it> The Mirror of Production </it> , the levers by which Marxism can most

effectively be " deprivileged" as a universal mode of discourse are not

philosophical, but rather anthropological and psychological.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#18:1> However, by agreeing to join the battle on this terrain,

Baudrillard-and by extension postmodernism in general- exposes its own

concepts to empirical evaluation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#19:1> Postmodernism, at its root, contains an ontological base with

embedded arguments about the nature of reality, even though it chooses to

proceed mostly by means of epistemological critique.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#20:1> Although this realization may be difficult to draw out in the

humanities, and especially in aesthetics ( and while the dichotomy between

the philosophically reconstructed antinomies of ontology and epistemology is

itself arguably false and ideological in nature), penetration of the

conceptual and terminological fog behind which postmodernism maneuvers should

not be as daunting in the domain of the analysis of social relations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#21:1> However these relations are organized, they exist as objects beyond

systems of self-reference, even if their perception is hopelessly recurved on

their existence, as postmodernists of the orthodox literary persuasion seem

to believe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#22:1> In sum, rather than seeking internal contradictions in the carefully

crafted, terminologically crenelated conceptual edifice of postmodernism-that

is, instead of deconstructing deconstructionism- materialist criticism should

question whether postmodernism 's conceptual basis is empirically true.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#23:1> Further, in this context, truth should be construed in its

commonsensical meaning of a direct correspondence between utterance and

referent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#24:1> It is only after addressing such empirical questions that the matter

of the " class" truth of postmodernism can be confronted, i.e., its <it>

significance for political practice. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#25:1> It will also be illuminating to note at subsequent points in this

discussion that Marx 's own text anticipates just such developments as

postmodernism, as it will be to note the evolution of Althusser 's "

philosophical" interventions as they emerged co-temporally with the formative

texts of postmodernism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#26:1> After this contextual grounding, it will be possible to place

postmodernism in a larger paradigmatic genealogy and then understand its

meaning for materialist political practice.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#27:1> This analysis will end with the assignment of postmodernism to an

ideological nexus situated at the juncture of hypermature imperialism and the

total alienation of " actually-existing" human beings of the present.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#28:1> Perhaps ironically, both the structure of Baudrillard 's arguments, as

well as his empirical observations, will facilitate this operation. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#29:1> <h> <bold> Contextualizing Postmodernism </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#30:1> In an earlier paper ( Wenger, 1991), I argued that the essence of

postmodernism was located in its socio-political origin: the despairing post-

1968 leftist North Atlantic intelligentsia denied its allegedly rightful turn

at the levers of history.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#31:1> This resentment was enlarged by-and festered as a result of-its

attribution to the perceived fecklessness of that class that had formerly

been held by most " revolutionary" intellectuals to be the emancipatory

subject of history: the proletariat of the advanced capitalist societies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#32:1> Both Wakefield ( 1990) and Bauman ( 1988) agree-with different

sentiments-that contemporary postmortem social theory, particularly that of

Baudrillard, has its ideological taproot in the rebuff of the political

leadership of leftist intellectuals by the proletariat during and after the

Events of May 1968.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#33:1> The obvious implication is that this theoretical outcropping

represents a retaliatory political response by means of theoretical

explanation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#34:1> In any event, it is not, nor should it have been, surprising that the

political denouement of the aborted " eruption of Eros" of 1968, to use

Katsiaficas' ( 1987) construction, would produce theoretical disarray of

prodigious dimensions at the Sorbonne, and in similar venues in Europe and

North America.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#35:1> Over the following decade, which Elliott ( Althusser, 1990:xx)

brackets in French political history with the defeat of the French Union of

the Left in 1978, but which also included on a broader front Nixon, Chile,

Kent/Jackson State, and myriad other disasters for the international

proletariat and its sympathizers, the postmortem project unfolded and

established itself where formerly only almost-communards and near-communists

held theoretical sway.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#36:1> However, to plumb the conjunctural origins of a theoretical tendency,

and even to assign it its proper political valence, is not necessarily to

negate its errors, nor to learn from them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#37:1> In the present instance, postmodernism will be seen not only in its

historical uniqueness, but as a mode of a much longer-standing reactionary

project, with which it shares scientific defects, as well as having developed

its own. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#38:1> Having stated the above. some cautionary notes are in order.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#39:1> One difficulty is that it is somewhat dubious to make assertions

about postmodernism in general.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#40:1> Although the nature of postmortem analysis makes it difficult to find

a seminal text in the tradition that does not make aesthetics, philosophy,

and social theory a unified endeavor, and while the common source of this

tradition goes back to Nietzsche and even beyond, there are at least two

different citation " streams" that seem to have appeared in recent years and

flow by different paths through the fine arts and humanities on the one hand,

and the social sciences on the other.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#41:1> As evidence of this, in Lash 's ( 1990) <it> Sociology of

Postmodernism </it> there is no mention at all of Paul De Man, and in

Rosenau 's ( 1992:156-57) reader 's guide, <it> Post-modernism and the Social

Sciences </it> , other than in De Man 's role as an importer of Derrida 's

concepts, it is only the controversy around his politics that is discussed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#42:1> Therefore, in its current state, postmodernism 's intervention in

social theory/science should be seen as drawing on a limited wellspring,

mostly composed of the work of Foucault, Lyotard, and Baudrillard.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#43:1> ( Lash, in <it> Sociology of Postmodernism </it> , opines on why

Bourdieu should be included in this company, but this presents serious

reconstructive difficulties.)
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#44:1> While the somewhat more mediated impact of Derrida and others cannot

be ignored, the three listed above have most frequently engaged the attention

of explicitly social theorists, with the last two of greatest significance

for those functioning within the Marxist paradigm.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#45:1> The reason for this is fairly obvious, in that Lyotard and BaudriBard

deploy Marx 's own conceptual repertoire to " de-privilege" his own " grand

narrative."
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#46:1> Therefore, the main focus here will be on those Bourdieu calls the "

popes" of post-modernism. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#47:1> In his foreword to Lyotard 's <it> The Postmodern Condition </it>

, Jameson ( 1984:vii) places postmodernism in the context of an overall

movement toward models of a post-capitalist society.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#48:1> He links Lyotard to Guy Debord, the Situationist, in this regard, as

well as comparing his ideas to those of Henri Lefebvre.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#49:1> However, he also mentions theories of post-industrialism, as

expounded by Daniel Bell.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#50:1> This is the more suggestive comparison.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#51:1> While Lefebvre can certainly be seen as having taken a critical

stance toward existing social relations for the purpose of transforming them,

and, whatever else might be said of Debord, his radical critique of the

social relations of advanced capitalism has an emancipatory bent, what is to

be made of Bell, the proponent of the " end of ideology""
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#52:1> In the context of postmodernism, what of Bell 's ( 1976) arguments in

The <it> Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism </it> , to the effect that the

critical, modernist tendencies of the core capitalist societies are

counter-systemic, counter-cultural, and counter-productive? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#53:1> It is arguable that Jameson is wrong in this regard, or at least

superficial in his comparison.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#54:1> To be sure, everything that starts with " post" does not necessarily

dwell under the same conceptual roof.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#55:1> However, Jameson 's actual reasoning in drawing this connection is

sound, given Bell 's attempt to revive a belief in the existence of a

non-industrial capitalist society based on the production, ownership, and

exchange of knowledge, which are well-known essentials of the postmodern

social theory of Baudrillard and Lyotard.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#56:1> Perhaps more important, Bell 's work going back as far as <it> The End

of Ideology </it> ( 1962) was associated with a much broader and somewhat

diffuse ideological movement in the 1950s and 1960s.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#57:1> The sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit, goals of this theoretical

tendency were to replace the category of class as the operative unit of

social analysis or to relegate it to historical utility only, as in the case

of estate or caste, and/or to treat the contradictions of capitalism as

merely theoretical conjecture or no longer historically relevant.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#58:1> This position was associated with a largely technocratic stance on

the solution to existing social problems.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#59:1> The various elements of this theoretical development could be found

in the works of a number of authors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#60:1> One of the best known and earliest was Galbraith 's <it> The Affluent

Society </it> where he rejects the concept of structural contradiction and

denies the chronic depressionary tendencies of capitalist societies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#61:1> Indeed, this position was elevated to the status of the self-evident

until its validity was subsequently and summarily dashed on the shoals of the

1957-58 recession in the U.S. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#62:1> Bottomore 's ( 1966) small but influential <it> Classes in Modern

Society </it> also attempted a clever centrist slight of hand which is of

considerable significance to understanding the postmodernist social and

theoretical project.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#63:1> Bottomore consigned " Marxist" class categories to the dustbin of

historical, but not universal, validity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#64:1> Their obsolescence ensued with the appearance of so-called " status

groups" in advanced capitalist societies, a concept of allegedly Weberian

lineage.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#65:1> The theoretical justification was a highly skewed reading of Weber,

which textual intervention heavily foregrounded " consumption" as the key

social activity in such societies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#66:1> This intervention was mostly derived from Parsons' ( 1946) reading of

Weber in <it> The Structure of Social Action </it> ( see Wenger 1978, 1980a,

1980b, 1987).
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#67:1> Both of these positions- i.e., the posited historical limitations of

a class model derived from the " productionist" meta-narrative of Marx, as

well as the specific replacement of relations of production with relations of

consumption as the key dimension of social conflict and change-are at the

core of Baudrillard 's ( 1975, 1981) and Lyotard 's ( 1984, 1988) key writings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#68:1> It should also be noted that Lyotard and Baudrillard pursue their

arguments using Marxist categories, with emendations, and denounce dogmatic

Marxist political forms as mere extensions of the tyrannies of the past.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#69:1> In this last, they extend Foucault 's assault on the rule of the

bourgeoisie in particular, and the Enlightenment in general, as nothing more

than the extension of historically previous modes of domination, but by

different methods. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-016#70:1> The commonality between postmodernism and the earlier tendencies

positing a post-industrial and, by extension, postmortem society was not

confined to one or two statements.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#71:1> Lenski 's <it> Power and Privilege </it> ( 1966), published the same

year as Bottomore 's work, relegated the efficacy of class analysis to a "

modernity" ending before WWII, and replacing it with a post-"WI condition

that, it was argued with vigor, demanded new forms of analysis of social

inequality harmonious with the new realities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#72:1> The further link that gives cohesiveness to an otherwise rather loose

collection of thinkers, appears in Dahrendorf 's <it> Class and Class Conflict

in Industrial Society </it> ( 1959).
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#73:1> This analysis claimed to provide both a new way of understanding

social conflict and a new way of reconstructing hitherto existing models of

social conflict.
<ICE-USA:W2A-016#74:1> It raised more than the notion of an historical limit to Marxist

models of social conflict based on the relations of production, as could be

found in Lenski or Bottomore. </p> </I>
