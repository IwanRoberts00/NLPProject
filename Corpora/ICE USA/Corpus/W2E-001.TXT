<ICE-USA:W2E-001#1:1> <h> The Democrats' 'big tent'</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#2:1> <h> Boston Herald, Sept. 17, 1991</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#3:1> Paul Tsongas finally has some company.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#4:1> The ex-senator from Massachusetts, who had been billing himself as "

the world 's supply of Democratic presidential candidates," was joined over

the weekend by two Democrats who couldn't be more unalike: Virginia 's

governor, L. Douglas Wilder, and Iowa 's junior senator, Tom Harkin.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#5:1> After months of drooping lifelessly, the fabled " big tent" of the

Democratic Party is billowing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#6:1> Lately the GOP has taken to calling itself a " big tent," too (

mostly to make a virtue of its inability to come together on such emotional

social/moral issues as abortion and gay rights).
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#7:1> But while there may be divergent voices within Republican ranks on

everything from the federal budget to the " new world order," the only

Republican voice that will count in 1992 will be George Bush 's.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#8:1> Happily for American voters, that won't be true of the Democrats.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#9:1> Wilder and Harkin bring profoundly different visions and ideals to the

presidential campaign.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#10:1> And out of the clash of their opinions and attitudes in the months

ahead, the Democratic Party may finally get a clue to what it stands for and

where it is headed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#11:1> After Michael Dukakis' defeat in 1988, the Democrats were riven

by a debate between those who believe he could have beaten Bush if only he'd

been more forth 'dghtly liberal, and those who insist--correctly, we think - -

that the Democrats will never retake the White House until their presidential

candidates abandon the kookiness of their party 's left wing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#12:1> That debate is mirrored in the contrasts between Harkin and

Wilder.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#13:1> Harkin represents the Democratic Party 's left--the higher-taxes,

bigger- government, class-warfare, Water-gate-baby fringe.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#14:1> Wilder, by contrast, comes from the party 's moderate center--on a

platform dubbed " The New Mainstream," he campaigns against taxes, against

Washington, against deficits, against moral licentiousness.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#15:1> Passionately, Harkin calls for cutting

&dollar;160 billion from the defense budget and plowing it into the traditional slew

of domestic programs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#16:1> Wilder sings a very different tune promising to cut

&dollar;50 billion from the federal budget and return it in the form of tax cuts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#17:1> Blacks of his age grew up, he says, believing " that the government

imposed too many restrictions, too many barriers, too many limitations.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#18:1> We were not asking government for anything... but to remove

itself.?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#19:1> Wilder reflects the Democratic Party 's serious core; Harkin, its

angry excesses.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#20:1> Both men have flaws, but both are superb campaigners.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#21:1> The 1992 race just got interesting.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#22:1> <h> Keeping peace In the East</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#23:1> The peace pact in the conflict over the disputed province of

Nagorno- Karabakh offers hope that the newly independent Soviet republics can

settle their differences without coercion from a dictatorial central

government.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#24:1> The province, part of Muslim Azerbaijan, has an Armenian majority

and an Azeri minority, a situation which has led to demands for union with

neighboring Armenia and fighting between the rival republics and contentious

ethnic factions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#25:1> Through the good offices of Russian Federation President Boris

Yeltsin and Nursultan Naza bayev, the president of Kazakhstan, a truce was

negotiated among all the parties involved.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#26:1> The accord calls for further negotiations to resolve differences,

disarming of rival gangs within the province, and an effort to resettle

refugees.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#27:1> Most importantly, Armenia has renounced any claims to the area.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#28:1> In return, Azerbaijan has agreed to grant more autonomy to the

province 's Armenians.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#29:1> One reason the West was reluctant to support independence

movements within the Soviet Union was the fear that the forces pulling the

union apart would unleash ancient ethnic hatreds, leading to a generation of

mini-conflicts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#30:1> But three years of fighting, which left more than 800 dead and half a

million homeless, belies the argument that the Kremlin was in any wise an

effective peace-keeper.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#31:1> Newly liberated national groups aren't stupid.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#32:1> While there is considerable competition for contested territory, they

realize that peace is essential to the development of democratic institutions

and the move to a market economy. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#33:1> For many of these groups, the breakup of the Soviet empire (

successor of czarist imperialism) offers the first real prospect of freedom

and independence in hundreds of years.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#34:1> They aren't about to throw away that opportunity in border

disputes.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#35:1> <h> Prison privatization: Step 1</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#36:1> <h> Boston Herald, Sept. 30, 1991</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#37:1> The decision to hire a private company to provide medical

services to Massachusetts prisoners, said Gov. William Weld last Thursday, "

is an excellent example of the privatization approach we plan to employ

throughout state government." It 's a pretty mild and straightforward

approach: A spend-thrift and inefficient firm that had been mostly staffed

with state workers will be replaced with a private firm, whose payroll will

be its own responsibility and which will be bound by stiff contractual

obligations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#38:1> Of course, a more radical-minded privatizer would want to see the

whole kit and caboodle privatized - - not just medical services but the

running of all prison operations.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#39:1> We don't know if Weld the Downsizer has dared to think such

unconventional thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#40:1> But guess what?
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#41:1> The Legislature has.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#42:1> Under Chapter 799 of the Acts of 1985, the commonwealth is "

authorized to enter into a contract with a private organization for the

financing, operation, and maintenance of one state correctional facility."
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#43:1> The Legislature 's interest in trying a different way of doing

corrections--it backed up the statute with a budgetary authorization - - was

commendable.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#44:1> Sadly, predictably, the then-governor flatly refused to consider

anything that would reduce the scope or expense of government.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#45:1> " Given the cost and control issues involved in privatization of

correction," Gov. Dukakis wrote in April 1986, " I could not support any such

effort in this area at this time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#46:1> Times have changed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#47:1> So has the thinking in the corner office.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#48:1> Across-the- board prison-privatization is a reform to consider anew;

contracting out inmate medical care is a very good first step.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#49:1> Under the Dukakis regime, Goldberg Medical Associates of Salem

provided medical services for the Correction Department.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#50:1> That was the firm whose boss collected

&dollar;192,000 per year, charged most of his Lincoln Continental to the taxpayers,

and had 400 state employees working for him.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#51:1> By the time Goldberg got finished enjoying his perks, the per-inmate

cost of medical services in Massachusetts was twice the national average.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#52:1> By contracting the work out, Weld expects to cut the state

payroll by 250, to slash the frequency of outside medical trips for inmates,

and to save taxpayers more than

&dollar;8 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#53:1> Privatization has a stellar track record.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#54:1> The more Massachusetts tries it, the more Massachusetts ( except the

former governor, maybe) will take it.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#55:1> <h> Let 's not baby criminals</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#56:1> <h> Boston Herald, Oct. 5, 1991</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#57:1> In the past five years, the number of murders committed by

juveniles has doubled.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#58:1> But while current state law allows for juveniles charged with

certain serious and violent crimes to be tried as adults, the system has

failed to work as intended.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#59:1> In 1989, only 11 of 169 cases were successfully transferred from

juvenile to adult criminal court.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#60:1> In 1990, the figure was 11 of 118 cases.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#61:1> But the numbers tell us little about the real

injustice--injustices which rest most heavily on the shoulders of the

victim 's families, for in most instances the victims too were children.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#62:1> Such was the case of Damien Bynoe, 16, who was charged with the

murders of 11-year-old Charles Copney and 15-year-old Corey Grant.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#63:1> " As soon as a judge ruled Bynoe could not be tried as an adult,

he changed his plea to guilty," Gov. William Weld said Thursday in announcing

his legislation to charge the juvenile justice system.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#64:1> Thus, guilty of two cold- blooded killings, Bynoe will be a free man

at age 21.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#65:1> " A system that puts a convicted murderer back on the streets

just because he turns 21 is a system that has failed," Weld said, as the

parents of the two youthful victims looked on.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#66:1> Weld 's bill would remove those aged 14 to 17 who are charged with

first- or second-degree murder, manslaughter, aggravated rape, armed assault

with intent to murder, or armed burglary from the jurisdiction of the

juvenile court.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#67:1> Those charged with lesser offenses could still be transferred to

criminal court but under this proposal all transfer hearings would be public

and any offense involving a firearm would be subject to transfer

proceedings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#68:1> Given the increases in juvenile crime and the violent nature of

far too many of those offenses, the increases in gang-related violence, and

the terror it has brought on too many inner city neighborhoods, this

legislation comes not a moment too soon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#69:1> If there is a flaw in the current proposal it is one of omission.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#70:1> Weld will need to come up with some real answers about where these

no-longer-juvenile offenders will be housed, if for no other reason than to

deprive reluctant legislators of a reason to kill the bill before it ever

sees the light of day.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#71:1> This is much too important an issue to be allowed to languish on

Beacon Hill.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#72:1> <h> Restoring Peace in Haiti</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#73:1> Jean-Bertrand Arlstide 's landslide election as president of Haiti

less than eight months ago was historic.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#74:1> The popular Roman Catholic priest, who espouses peace and is revered

by many, became Haiti 's first democratically elected president in the

country 's 200 year history.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#75:1> The United Nations and the Organization of American States monitored

the Haitian elections, and helped ensure that the Haitian people could vote

without fear of violence and bloodshed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#76:1> Historically, Haiti 's leaders have been determined by military

might.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#77:1> Bloody coups dominate the nation 's history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#78:1> That was supposed to have changed with Aristide 's election.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#79:1> But old ways die hard.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#80:1> Last Sunday night, Aristide was ousted by Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras,

his provisional commander-in-chief, turned leader of a coup.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#81:1> The general claims that the rebellion occurred because Aristide

abused his power.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#82:1> Aristide, from exile, said that during the coup Cedras confronted him

at the National Palace and said.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#83:1> " Now I am president.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#84:1> The OAS, which is normally committed to regional democracy and

worked to mid-wife Haitian democracy, has imposed diplomatic and economic

sanctions against the military junta, in an effort to pressure Cedras to step

down and return Aristide to the presidency.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#85:1> Many Haitian-Americans are up-set at the lack of a stronger response

and at a lack of response by the United Nations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#86:1> For now, the response has been appropriate.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#87:1> The OAS has enough collective power to teach Cedras, and all the

other potential Cedrases in small countries where democracy is new and

fragile, that violence is no longer the ticket to the presidency.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#88:1> It is imperative that talk be tried and sanctions imposed before the

military is brought in and more blood 19 shed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#89:1> The OAS has the power to use " any measures" appropriate to

restore constitutional rule in Haiti and should, if that proves necessary.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#90:1> But the first measure democratic nations should use must be

non-violent.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#91:1> That will show how democracies prefer to work. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#92:1> <h> An ugly, false accusation </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#93:1> The ugly accusation that President George Bush is an anti-Semite,

leveled by a member of the Israeli Knesset over the weekend, is an

embarrassment to that nation and to its supporters in the United States.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#94:1> The smear was prompted by the president 's demand that Congress

postpone action on Jerusalem 's request for

&dollar;10 billion in loan guarantees.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#95:1> <Rehavam Ze'evi, a member of an obscure p arty and minister without

portfolio in the Shamir government, reportedly accused the president of being

motivated by anti-Semitism.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#96:1> Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens immediately repudiated the

charge, stating that it reflected the views neither of the government nor the

Israeli public.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#97:1> One needn't agree with the president 's position of using

humanitarian aid as a club to bring Israel to the conference table, to be

appalled by such allegations.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#98:1> <George Bush may be accused of many thing s, including ingratitude

toward a loyal ally and a myopic view of where America 's regional interests

lie.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#99:1> <He may not be accused of hatred of Jews. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#100:1> As vice president, Mr. Bush was directly involved in the effort

to rescue Ethiopian Jews.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#101:1> After the first massive air lift from Ethiopia to Israel, hundreds

of refugees were left stranded in Sudanese camps.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#102:1> Informed of their plight, Bush put together the State Department

team that eventually negotiated their departure.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#103:1> After the fall of Ethiopia 's Marxist regime, the administration

worked with the interim government to secure the exodus of several hundred

Jews who remained in the country.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#104:1> <Hardly the actions of one motivated by a nimosity toward Jews.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-001#105:1> Such despicable, baseless accusations can only exacerbate an

already acrimonious debate.
<ICE-USA:W2E-001#106:1> <Let the loan guarantees be discussed on their merits, without a

resort to ad hominem arguments by either side.</p> </I>
