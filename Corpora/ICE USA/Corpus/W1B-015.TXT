<ICE-USA:W1B-015#1:1> <h> 2/15/09</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#2:1> <h> Dear Kelly,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-015#3:1> Thank you again for offering to help me with this project for Dr.

Meyer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#4:1> I know you're busy - - are 're we all? - - and it 's difficult to find

someone who is willing to take the time to write, which is somewhat of a lost

art form.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#5:1> I enjoy writing, and I wish I had more opportunities to do so.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#6:1> I especially enjoy corresponding with people through letters while

traveling or living abroad.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#7:1> Call me old school, but I think it 's terrific to send and receive

letters that travel great distances.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#8:1> It 's fun to imagine the route a particular letter had to take to get

to a friend or family member.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#9:1> I also like to receive letters that have postage and post marks from

countries around the world.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#10:1> I'm not a stamp collect 'm, but I have always saved the envelopes that

I've received fr 'veoutside the United States.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#11:1>

<p> Well, I'm back in the swing 'm things at school.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#12:1> This is my fourth full-time, and last, semester in the program.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#13:1> After I finish this term, I will only have one class and my full-time

student teaching work that takes a semester to complete.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#14:1> If my current plans holds, I will take and pass the ESL test in May

that is required by the state of Massachusetts for a teaching license in the

field of English as a Second Language.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#15:1> This test, along with the literacy test that I took and passed last

year, will then allow me to apply to the Massachusetts Department of

Education ( MDOE) for a provisional state teaching license.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#16:1> In the summer I will then be in a position to apply for teaching

position in ESL or the fall.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#17:1> So, I will be getting paid to complete my student teaching

requirement for my department rather than paying my school for the experience

of working somewhere for nothing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#18:1> Additionally, I will complete the final class, Psycholinguistics, in

the evening.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#19:1> It will be a busy and stressful time, holding my first formal

teaching position in an American school while taking on of the more

challenging classes in the program, but I will get it done.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#20:1> Then, at the end of December, I will take the comprehensive ( "

comps") exam, an exit exam that everyone must pass in order to complete the

program and receive their masters degree.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#21:1> There is a lot of stress and anxiety among students in my program

regarding the comp exam, which is understandable.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#22:1> Students have only two chances to pass the exam.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#23:1> If they fail both attempts they can't graduate and receive their

degree.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#24:1> However, most people pass the test on the first attempt.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#25:1> Indeed, the program is structure so that diligent students who work

had throughout their studies, as I have been doing, will pass the comp exam.

</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#26:1>

<p> Although I'm too busy to seriou 'my entertain this notion now, it has

occurred to me in recent months that what will I do once I complete the

program this December.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#27:1> My intention, as I stated, is to get my full teacher license to work

as a K-6 ESL teacher in the state of Massachusetts.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#28:1> I don't know where in the state I will work, but I would like to

remain within an easy commute of my apartment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#29:1> This means I will either work somewhere in greater Boston or

Cambridge.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#30:1> I like Cambridge - - if you recall, I stayed in Cambridge the first

six weeks I lived in Boston - - and it has a strong reputation for providing

quality schools for ESL/Bilingual students.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#31:1> So, I think it would be a good fit for me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#32:1> Another option would be to apply for a teaching fellowship through

the Fullbright foundation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#33:1> I would apply for the fellowship, which is called an English Teaching

Assistant ( ETA), this summer, I think, and I would be sent overseas next

year, possibly the spring.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#34:1> The ETA fellowship would place me in a classroom to work as a

co-teacher or assistant to a local K-6 teacher.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#35:1> It would be a great experience, and professional opportunity for me

to receive this job.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#36:1> It 's highly competitive, so I'm not counting on i 'm
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#37:1> Nonetheless, having the Fullbright foundation on my resume would be a

tremendous asset.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#38:1> Additionally, I would get the formal teaching experience in a

classroom that my resume needs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#39:1> Plus I would get to satisfy my wanderlust that seems to pop up every

few years. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#40:1>

<p> Most of the ETA positions that don't require second language fluency,

thus the ones I would apply to, are in Eastern Europe and South East Asia.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#41:1> Given that I just spent 15 months in South East Asia about three and

a half years ago, and that it 's been almost ten years since my travels in

Europe, I will probably pick Europe.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#42:1> Moreover, when I was in Europe I never visited the eastern part.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#43:1> Plus I still have a lot of friends in Europe, mostly in Ireland, so

it would be great to be closer to people who I haven't seen in ages.

Unfortunately, I can only pick one country on my application, and at this

time I don't have a clear favorite.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#44:1> I will work closely with my advisor on selecting the appropriate

choice, but I'll be 'llppy in most countries I think. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#45:1>

<p> If I don't get the ETA position, I will continue to live in the greater

Boston area and see how my opportunities unfold once I leave my department.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#46:1> I have thought seriously about applying for a position with the

International Schools Services, ISS, in a few years.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#47:1> International Schools are the best jobs available to teachers

overseas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#48:1> The pay is good, the quality of life is high, opportunities to travel

are great, and so on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#49:1> In order to be eligible to work for the ISS I need to have a masters

degree and two years formal teaching experience in the United States holding

a state teaching license, so this plan I can put on hold for a little while.

</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#50:1>

<p> I don't know if I want to be a teacher for the rest of my life, but I do

want to stay iin the field of education in some capacity, particularly in a

capacity that affords me the opportunity to live and work abroad from time to

time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#51:1> Through my graduate studies I've been exp 'ved to a number of fields

within education - - testing, special education, policy, etc. but I haven't

found one that I've really c 'veected with.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#52:1> I think I might like administration, particularly for the chance to

create a program that I know will work well for students.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#53:1> That idea is, obviously, many years in the making.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#54:1> Whatever speciality I choose, getting at least a few years of

classroom teaching under my belt is essential.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#55:1> I can't imagine devoting my life to education and not know what it 's

like working in the public/private school system.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#56:1> Working as a teacher will give me an indespensible knowledge base

that will sever me well my entire career. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#57:1>

<p> The weather has been unusually, and strangely, warm lately, almost spring

like.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#58:1> It feels good, of course, but I expect it to get very cold again

soon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#59:1> We're also 're for another dump of heavy snow fall.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#60:1> As we know, the weather in San Francisco can be unpredictable, but

I've never 'vewn weather such as the weather out here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#61:1> I truly understand what an inclement climate means now that I've

liv 'vein Boston for a year and half ( roughly).</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#62:1>

<p> I still find the first snowfall breathtaking, and I remember staring in

awe at the sheets of water that come down, along with the thunder and

lightning storms, during the summer months.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#63:1> In California rain is a rare sight between March and November,

especially in Southern California.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#64:1> One thing is for sure: it 's hard to imagine New England, between snow

fall and year round rain fall, will ever enter into a drought period. </p>

<p> I had a crazy thought lately.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#65:1> When I finish my studies, and I settle into a job, I want to buy a

motorcycle.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#66:1> I think I told you I had a motorbike in Thailand that I used almost

daily.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#67:1> Granted it was a small bike, a four stroke 150, but it gave me

confidence to ride a larger bike at some point.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#68:1> I think a 450 would be a perfect size bike for me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#69:1> I would take formal bike driving lessons, and I would only use it on

the weekends and for seasonal road trips.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#70:1> In other words, I would still use my car as my primary source of

transportation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#71:1> I know motorcycles can be dangerous, but I will train to be a skilled

rider, and I won't use it recklessly.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#72:1>

<p> There is so much beautiful country side to explore in New England that

having a motorbike to take road trips on would be incredible.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#73:1> In fact, I would say that one of the things I enjoy most about living

in Boston is that, like San Francisco, there is easy and tremendous access to

beautiful open spaces a short ride outside the city center.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#74:1> I've been 'vee to see a fair bit of Massachusetts since I arrived,

and a little bit of Rhode Island too, but there 's still a lot I want to see.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#75:1> I would love, for starters, to take a road trip through the Green

Mountains of Vermont or the upper coast of line of Maine.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#76:1> That would be awesome! </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#77:1>

<p> Well, I've cove 've a lot of ground in this letter, but I'm proba 'my still

a few hundred words short of a 2000 word sample for my professors' project.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#78:1> Therefore, I'll 'llnish the remaining two or three pages in my

response to your letter. </p>

<p> I hope you and Melissa have a great vacation this month.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#79:1> Enjoy my letter, and I look forward to receiving yours, hopefully in

a few weeks. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#80:1>

<p> All the best, John, Quincy, MA</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#81:1> <h> 8/17/09</h> <h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#82:1> Kelly,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#83:1>

<p> I hope this letter finds you and Melissa doing well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#84:1> I have a lot on my mind these days as I prepare for my new job to

start after Labor Day weekend.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#85:1> It 's my first full-time licensed teaching position!
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#86:1> I'l 'lle working as an elementary school teacher at the McKay school

in East Boston.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#87:1> It 's unclear what grades I' 'llbe teaching because McKay doesn't have

their final fall enrollment figures yet.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#88:1> However, it will be grades one, two, or three.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#89:1> I strongly prefer to have my own classroom, but that also is unclear.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#90:1> I might be a " pull out" teacher, which means I work with groups of

students who are strongly in need of special English language services.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#91:1> Although they'r 'reimits pedagogically to what a teacher can

accomplish in such a classroom, it 's not a bad position to start.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#92:1> After all, I' 'ma new teacher entering the field at a time of great

economic downturn and uncertainty.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#93:1> Indeed, hundreds of teachers will be " let go" this year in the

Boston Public Schools, a common, and troubling reality being played out

across the country.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#94:1> In other words, I should simply be thankful to have any teaching

position - - and I am.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#95:1> I was beginning to think that I might not land a teaching position by

the time I return to school to complete my final semester.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#96:1> If you recall, I need to complete my student teaching in the upcoming

semester in order to graduate.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#97:1> </p>

<p> As of the first of August I didn't have a single lead, and I was

beginning to consider other options, namely contacting the department at my

school to ask one of my teachers for their help in placing me in a local

school so I can work for free ( volunteer).
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#98:1> Naturally, I' 'mvery pleased that I 'll now be getting paid to complete

my state mandated student-teaching hours.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#99:1> I had applied for teaching positions with Quincy Public Schools (

where I live), the Cambridge Public Schools, and Boston Public Schools.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#100:1> Quincy told me that they weren't hiring, Cambridge turned me down

for most of the positions without even an interview, and Boston did the same.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#101:1> Finally, Boston called me in for a " preliminary interview." It was

the break I was looking for.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#102:1> During my interview, I was told that I was brought in primarily

because I was a man who wants to teach elementary education, and I have a

license in ESL, which is in very high demand in Boston.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#103:1> My first meeting with the recruiting manager went so well that he

refered me to his boss who was sitting nearby and helping him with the

screening process.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#104:1> We also had a positive talk.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#105:1> They liked my background ( professionally and educationally) and my

personality.
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#106:1> By the end of extended meeting I was offered a job on the spot!
<ICE-USA:W1B-015#107:1> I asked for a night to sleep on it, they gave me the weekend ( the

interview happened on a Thursday), and I accepted on Monday. </p> </I>
