<ICE-USA:W2A-008#1:1> <h> Aristotle 's God and the Authenticity of De mundo:</h>
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#2:1> <h> An Early Modern Controversy </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#3:1> IF HORSES HAD gods, said the Presocratic philosopher Xenophanes,

they would imagine them as horses, and similarly for cows.1 And likewise, one

might add, without the hypothetical qualification, for philosophers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#4:1> Certainly Aristotle 's God, the first unmoved mover of <it> Metaphysics

</it> 12, is made very much in the philosopher 's own image and likeness, for

he is pure thought.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#5:1> Aristotle 's philosopher-God not only outranks Plato 's

philosopher-king, he outphilosophizes <quote>  the philosopher, </quote>

since the sole object of his thought is thought, in other words, himself.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#6:1> His thinking, in Aristotle 's memorable if mysterious phrase, is a

thinking of thinking.2</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#7:1> While Plato 's gods have as their specific function the care for

all things ( <it> Laws </it> 900d), Aristotle 's God, totally absorbed in

self-contemplation and remote from the world he did not create and may not

even know,3 is clearly unconcerned about the fall of a sparrow.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#8:1> But if there is no room in the Aristotelian universe for a special

providence, controlling the fate of individuals, there might nonetheless be a

general one which governs the eternal and regular motion of the heavenly

spheres but does not influence the ephemeral and erratic movements of humans

and sparrows in the sublunary realm.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#9:1> Or so it was generally believed around the second century A.D.4
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#10:1> This account, which clearly developed from the Aristotelian

distinction between the perfect regularity of the heavens and the haphazard,

unpredictable nature of sublunary events, was the version of Aristotle 's

attitude towards divine providence which the Church Fathers knew and reacted

against.5
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#11:1> That most Aristotelian of Aristotelian commentators, Alexander of

Aphrodisias, presented a somewhat different view of divine providence, which

he considered to be more in line with his master 's philosophy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#12:1> Attempting to find an acceptable middle ground between the Epicurean

belief that the gods were totally unconcerned with the world and the Stoic

assertion that God took care of every humble detail in the universe,

Alexander assigned the operation of providence to the sublunary realm.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#13:1> He maintained, however, that it was strictly limited to the influence

of the regular motion of the heavenly bodies, which ensured the preservation

and welfare of species, but played no rote whatever in the good or bad

fortune ofindividuals.6
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#14:1> The patristic and, to a lesser extent, the Alexandrist interpretation

remained the standard versions of Aristotelian divine providence until the

nineteenth century.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#15:1> <?> pe(ì ( ós(o(,</?><&>Apparently, the original

transcriptionmost likely containing Ancient Greek typography-- has been lost

as a result of data being transferred from one word processing program to

another. This comment supplied by Darrell Penta, 2/8/09</&> usually known by

its Latin title <it> De mundo </it> , is a brief cosmological,

meteorological, geographical, and theological treatise, attributed to

Aristotle and dedicated to his pupil Alexander the Great.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#16:1> It contains a number of Peripatetic doctrines, such as the

transcendence of God, who is an unmoved mover, and the division of the

universe into a supralunary world composed of incorruptible ether and a

sublunary realm made up of fire, air, water and earth.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#17:1> But the treatise also presents providence as pervasive throughout the

entire universe and as affecting all entities within it, a view in conflict

not only with the self-absorption of the unmoved mover but also with the

belief in a circumscribed divine influence which the doxographical tradition,

the Church Fathers, and Alexander of Aphrodisias attributed to Aristotle.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#18:1> Thus, the author of <it> De mundo </it> defines the world as <quote>

the ordering and arrangement of all things, preserved by and through God

</quote> ( 391b11-12) and states that <quote> the old explanation that we

have all inherited from our fathers is that all things are from God, and were

framed by God, and no natural thing is of itself sufficient for itself,

deprived of the permanence which it derives from him </quote> (

397b13-16).7</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#19:1> We have no record of any doubts as to the authenticity of <it> De

mundo </it> until the fifth century A.D., when Proclus, citing the work as

evidence of Aristotle 's views, added the proviso <quote>  if the book <it>

De mundo </it> is by him."</quote>8
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#20:1> Unfortunately he gave no explanation for his uncertainty about its

authorship.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#21:1> The twelfth-century Jewish scholar Moses Maimonides was equally

uninformative when he dismissed <it> The Book of the Golden House </it> ( the

title given to the three Arabic translations of <it> De mundo </it> ) as

<quote>  idle talk </quote> and said that it belonged <quote> " to those [

works] which had been attributed to Aristotle but are not by him."</quote>9
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#22:1> Although the treatise was translated into Latin in the thirteenth

century, it was not until the Renaissance that Western scholars began to

discuss their reasons disbelieving or believing that <it> De mundo </it> was

genuine.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#23:1> Among the grounds they gave for doubting its authenticity were: the

highly rhetorical style, which seemed un-Aristotelian, as did its oratorical,

as opposed to philos method; the apparently anachronistic references to

Britain and Ceylon; and the preface, addressed to Alexander the Great, which

was, like the flattering reference to <quote> the worthy Plato </quote> and

the quotation from his <it> Laws </it> , highly uncharacteristic.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#24:1> The most important reasons for regarding the work as authentic were

the ancient <it> testimonia </it> :
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#25:1> Justin Martyr referred to an Aristotelian work that sounded like it

in his <it> Cohortatio ad Graecos </it> ; Apuleius stated in the preface to

his <it> De mundo </it> ( in fact a paraphrase of the Greek treatise) that he

was following Aristotle and Theophrastus; Philoponus cited it twice as a work

of Aristotle; and Stobaeus anthologized it in his <it> Eclogae </it> under

the heading: <quote> " From the Letter of Aristotle to

Alexander."</quote>11</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#26:1> But there was another, and for many scholars more compelling,

motive for accepting the treatise as genuine.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#27:1> The God of <it> De mundo </it> , who framed the world and was

responsible for the preservation of everything in it, seemed closer to

Christian notions of divinity than the generally accepted interpretations of

Aristotle 's God, who had not created the world, whose providence extended

only to the moon and who did not concern himself with the individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#28:1> Those who believed that Aristotelianism was essentially compatible

with Christianity were therefore inclined to support its authenticity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#29:1> The main purpose of Marsiho Ficino 's <it> Theologia platonica

</it> was to demonstrate that the Christian belief in the immorality of the

soul could be proven on the basis of reason, above all the reason embodied in

Platonic philosophy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#30:1> But Ficino also drew on other ancient philosophical systems to make

his points, as for example in Book 2, Chapter 13, entitled <quote> God Loves

and Provides, </quote> where he cites <it> Metaphysics </it>

12.10.1075a11-15 to show that, according to Aristotle, just as the order of

an army lies with its general, so the order universe as a whole lies with

God.12 Later in the same chapter, Ficino refers to an extended simile in <it>

De Mundo </it> ( 398b16-22) in order to explain how God controls everything

in the world like a puppeteer pulling strings.<fnr>13</fnr>
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#31:1> Here, in Ficino 's view, Aristotle firmly asserted the existence of

providence, just as he had in <it> Physics </it> 2.8-9, when be discussed the

teleology of nature, and in <it> Nicomachean Ethics </it>

10.8.1179a24-30.14</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#32:1> In this latter passage, Aristotle gives the following argument to

demonstrate that the wise man is dearest to the gods: <quote> if the gods

have any care for human affairs, as they are thought to have, it would be

reasonable both that they should delight in that which was best and most akin

to them ( i.e. intellect) and that they should reward those who love and

honour this most. </quote> This view of divinity does not fit with the

Peripatetic tradition that limited providence to the celestial spheres, much

less with the first prime mover of <it> Metaphysics </it> 12.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#33:1> It can perhaps best be explained as an example of Aristotle

accommodating himself to the religion of his day.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#34:1> Another reference to the popular belief that God rewards good

behavior and punishes bad ( and hence is not responsible for mere chance

events) occurs in <it> Magna moralia </it> 2.8.1207a6-11, where Aristotle

asks: <X> <quote> Can good fortune...be a kind of divine providence
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X35:1> This we cannot believe; for we look to God, as controlling good and

evil things, to apportion them in accordance with desert; whereas fortune and

its gifts are bestowed in very truth 'fortuitously'.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X36:1> If we attribute these gifts to God, we shall make him either an

incompetent judge or an unjust one; and this is alien to his

nature."</quote></X><fnr>15</fnr>
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X37:1> Many Christian scholars saw in both these passages a positive

attitude towards divine providence which appeared to be in line with that

presented in <it> De mundo </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X38:1> These texts were therefore frequently cited in conjunction with the

treatise by those who believed it to be authentic.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#X39:1> Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, for instance, in his treatise

against divinatory astrology, alludes to both texts, along with Plato 's

statements about divine justice ( <it> Laws </it> 715e and 73oc) quoted in

<it> De mundo </it> ( 401624-29), a book he describes as <quote> certainly

worthy of Aristotle 's wisdom. </quote> He uses these quotations to maintain

that the philosopher had strongly affirmed his belief in a God directing us

in all things.16 Pico 's nephew, Gianfrancesco, in his treatise on divine

providence, makes the same point about Aristotle, likewise quoting support

<it> Magna moralia </it> 2.8 and several passages from De mundo, <quote> a

book certainly worthy of Aristotle 's wisdom, according to the testimony of my

uncle Giovanni Pico."17</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#X40:1> But <it> De mundo </it> was not always an unmixed blessing for

those who sought to reconcile Aristotelianism and Christianity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X41:1> Cardinal Bessarion, in his <it> In calumniatorem Phitonis </it> (

1469), attempted to refute the arguments by which George of Trebizond had, in

his view, made Aristotle into a Christian.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X42:1> One such argument, put forward by George in the second book of his

<it> Comparationes philosophorum Aristotelis et Platonis </it> , was that

Aristotle had believed that God created the world <it> ex nihilo </it>

because, according to his philosophy, both the heavens and nature were

dependent on God.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X43:1> For Bessarion, however, this dependence did not mean, as George

maintained, that Aristotle 's God was the efficient cause of the world, but

merely its final cause.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X44:1> To emphasize the difference between Aristotelian and Christian

notions of divine <foreign> creatioti</foreign>,Bessarion adduced Aristotle 's

own words in <it> De mundo </it> ( 397b2o-3o), where he said that although

God is <quote>  the preserver and creator </quote> of everything in the

universe, he does not endure <quote>  the weariness of a being that

administers and labours </quote> but acts by means of an indefatigable power

which extends <quote> even over things which are far distant from him.

</quote> Bessarion interpreted this to mean that Aristotle 's God, unlike the

Christian one, was not the efficient cause of the universe, for he himself

had not directly created it, but had instead operated by means of a celestial

force which made, administered, governed and preserved everything.18</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#X45:1> The awkward implications which Bessarion found in this passage

were conveniently ignored by those, such as Agostino Steuco, the scholarly

bishop and Vatican librarian, who found in <it> De mundo </it> a mine of

useful material for establishing the fundamental harmony between pagan

philosophy and Christian theology.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X46:1> In his <it> De perenni philosophia </it> Steuco aimed to demonstrate

how close many ancient thinkers were to Christian ideas of monotheism, the

creation of the world, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of

divine providence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X47:1> In Book 4 Steuco drew heavily on <it> De mundo </it> as proof that

Aristotle 's God governed not merely the motion of the heavens but also the

entire world.19
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X48:1> To justify his reliance on a work whose authenticity had been

questioned, Steuco cited Justin Martyr 's reference to it.20
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X49:1> He also claimed that its genuineness was proved by the fact that

Aristotle had said many of the same things, albeit more obscurely, in his

other works.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X50:1> Fake, for example, the statement in <it> De mundo </it> that <quote>

 the favor of heaven bestowed especial honor upon the generation of the

pious </quote> ( 4ooa34-b1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X51:1> The same sentiment could be found in <it> Nicomachean Ethics </it>

1o.8, where Aristotle says that the man who exercises and cultivates his

intellect is most favored by God.21</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#X52:1> Muzio Pansa borrowed this comparison of texts, along with much

else, from Steuco, and put it in his <it> De osculo ethnicae et Christianae

philosophiae </it> a similar attempt to show the agreement of pagan and

Christian ideas, in which both passages are cited as proof of Aristotle 's

belief in divine providence.22
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X53:1> Pansa also used <it> De mundo </it> to corroborate his theory that

the reason why Chaldaean, Egyptian, Arabic, Greek, and Roman philosophies

were so close to Christianity was that they all derived ultimately from

Hebrew doctrines.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X54:1> Aristotle implied as much when he stated that the belief that all

things are from God is <quote> the old explanation which we have all

inherited from our fathers </quote> ( 397b13-16), in other words, as Pansa

put it, <quote>  it is drawn from the Hebrews, whose doctrine is most

ancient, going back in time beyond all Greek tradition."23</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-008#X55:1> Pansa 's theory was further developed later in the seventeenth

century by Pierre-Daniel Huet, who in his <it> Demonstratio evangelica </it>

of 1679 attempted to underpin the idea of an <quote> ancient theology

</quote> stretching back to Moses by locating historical characters who could

have acted as conduits for the transmission of Old Testament doctrines to the

heathen.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X56:1> In Josephus and Eusebius, Huet found a reference to a Peripatetic

named Clearchus, who reported that his teacher Aristotle had conversed with a

Jew.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X57:1> The fruit of this conversation, Huet maintained, could be found in

<it> Metaphysics </it> 12 and also in what Aristotle said in <it> De mundo

</it> ( 397b13-16) about the ancient doctrine that God produced and preserved

all things, <quote> which certainly seems to pertain to Moses."</quote>24
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X58:1> But in his <it> Alnetanae quaestiones </it> , published eleven years

later, Huet came to believe, for unspecified reasons, that <it> De mundo

</it> was spurious.
<ICE-USA:W2A-008#X59:1> He now attributed the work to an anonymous author more recent than

Aristotle; and the passage he had previously quoted as evidence of Mosaic

influence on the philosopher was now used to show that certain Peripatetics

had not followed Aristotle in denying the creation of the world.25</p> </I>
