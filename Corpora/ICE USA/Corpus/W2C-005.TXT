<ICE-USA:W2C-005#1:1> <h> Memories of old days at Keanae School come to the fore as reunion

nears</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#2:1> KEANAE - One vivid memory Helen Nakanelua has about Keanae School

is her teacher coming to the school on a horse.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#3:1> At age 89, Nakanelua has been holding on to the memory for a long

time.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#4:1> She acknowledges that she is one of the oldest living people who

attended the little school on the isolated stretch of the East Maui

coastline.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#5:1> Nakanelua said she still can still picture teacher Maggie Soon

arriving on a horse wearing her riding skirt.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#6:1> Marc Aquino remembers the benefits of a small school when he

attended Keanae School in the 1960s.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#7:1> " What I really liked about it is you get the full attention from

your teachers," said Aquino, who now resides in Kahului. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#8:1> There were about 30 students when he attended, with classes for

1st through 8th grades but just two teachers assigned to handle all of the

grades in just two classrooms. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#9:1> Former Keanae School students, teachers, administrators and past

and present Keanae and Wailuanui residents will be recalling all that and

more at the Keanae School Reunion 2001.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#10:1> The reunion is to be held July 28 and will include a luau at noon

in the Keanae Congregational Church Hall.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#11:1> Organizers estimate around 1,000 people plan to attend, which would

be roughly 10 times the resident population of the Wailua-Keanae community

today. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#12:1> Chairman Clement Kock-Wah joked, " I kind of started all of this

mess up."
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#13:1> Kock-Wah, who grew up working in the taro patches of Keanae and

attended the school in the 1940s, said, " I want to give back to the older

people." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#14:1> Kock-Wah also lived on Oahu and around Maui but eventually came

back to Keanae.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#15:1> He lives kitty-corner to the school, he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#16:1> He said that for awhile he talked and shared ideas about the

reunion, which most thought was a good idea, and then he finally " took the

bull by the horns." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#17:1> " Our old kupuna are very excited about it," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#18:1> There is a handful of former students helping out. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#19:1> He said he wants to thank that " handful of people," including

friends outside of Keanae and kupuna who donated materials and money.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#20:1> But Kock-Wah in turn earned praise from Nakanelua. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#21:1> " I thought it was something really great.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#22:1> It took Clement Kock-Wah to put Keanae on the map again," she

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#23:1> The first school was near the Keanae Congregational Church on the

Keanae peninsula, according to historical reports filed with a nomination

form to place the school building on the National Register of Historic

Places. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#24:1> In 1909, as the result of a land exchange, the school moved to

the present site on Hana Highway.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#25:1> The new schoolhouse was completed in 1912 by contractor Hugh Howell.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#26:1> Through the years, the population of the region has dwindled, and

the school 's enrollment was fallen to minimal levels.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#27:1> Older students from 4th grade and up are now bused to Hana High &

Elementary School 14 miles of winding road away. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#28:1> There were three students at the school this year, said current

teacher Laura Akiu Straight.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#29:1> The school accommodates kindergarten to 3rd-graders. The school is a

single building with three rooms, said Kock-Wah.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#30:1> There also used to be a teacher 's cottage on the property. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#31:1> Because the school was small, the academic atmosphere could be a

challenge for some students, according to some who attended the school.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#32:1> " There were so many grades in one classroom," said Vicky Martin,

who attended the school through the 8th grade, in 1956.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#33:1> " It 's very different ( from other schools)." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#34:1> With several grades taught by one teacher in the same room,

Martin said, it was hard for some students to learn.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#35:1> But Aquino said having a mix of grade levels in a class was a "

good incentive for everyone to learn."
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#36:1> It would be embarrassing if you couldn't solve a problem on the

chalkboard, while a younger student could.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#37:1> " It did happen," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#38:1> " They got so shame," agreed Martin. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#39:1> Aquino also remembers some old school practices that probably

weren't customary only at Keanae School. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#40:1> " We used to get licking from the teacher," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#41:1> " I can still see the guava stick behind the ( teacher 's) desk.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#42:1> " That 's how we were disciplined." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#43:1> The youngsters were also subject to inspection for personal

cleanliness, including have their fingernails checked.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#44:1> Some children had a hard time keeping their nails clean because they

worked in the taro fields.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#45:1> There are also sunnier sides to the classes at Keanae, including

the socialization among youngsters at lunch time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#46:1> Aquino remembers bringing his kini 'ai, or two-piece lunch can.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#47:1> There was a bottom container for poi or rice, with a second container

stacked on top to hold fried fish, fried frog, sardines, chicken or even

jerky meat made from pig. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#48:1> " That was the days we used to share our lunch," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#49:1> " It was fun, it was no big thing." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#50:1> " Because we are from that kind of community we learn how to

gather our food from the land and the ocean." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#51:1> Being in a rural community where children helped their families

by working in taro patches, Martin said poi " was the main lunch for the

kids."
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#52:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#53:1> While memories may differ, Nakanelua, Aquino and Martin all agree

that majority of the students who went to the school turned out well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#54:1> " All of the kids excelled in school," Aquino said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#55:1> " I would say Keanae School kids did well out there." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#56:1> Perhaps the success resulted from the small school setting, the

discipline by guava stick, or maybe the strict teachers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#57:1> " Some of the kids ( who got scolded) today turned out to be the

best students," Martin said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#58:1> " They came out better persons." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#59:1> Nakanelua is looking forward to seeing former teachers, residents

and old friends at the reunion.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#60:1> Most Keanae students had to go elsewhere to live.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#61:1> " They are holding good jobs," she said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#62:1> " There 's no way they can stay here; there 's no jobs." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#63:1> But for one day, she said, they can all be back in their little

country school again. </p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-005#64:2> <h> Building Program</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#65:2> <h> Contractor constructs hands-on class, shelves, office and student

pride on donations he raises </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#66:2> HANA - - Building contractor Rick Rutiz was looking for a way to

combine his love of construction and his desire to teach children when he

created a carpentry program at Hana High and Elementary School.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#67:2> In the year since he started, Rutiz has fulfilled his dream of

working with children while building buildings and more importantly, building

pride within students.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#68:2> The results have been remarkable, according to program participants,

their parents, counselors and the head administrator at Hana High School.</p>

With Rutiz 's training, and the financial support of private donors and

grant-giving foundations, Hana students have built a counselor 's office, a

custodial complex, much-needed bookshelves and room dividers for classrooms,

a storage facility roof and even a home for a needy family in Hana.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#69:2> Officially, Rutiz 's project is called the Hana School PTSA

Construction Trades Program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#70:2> Last fall, the program started with eight students and

&dollar;45,000 in contributions Rutiz got from his clients.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#71:2> By May 2001, with Rutiz and supporters still soliciting donations,

the program was working with as many as 20 students and had a budget of

&dollar;120,000. <ICE-USA:W2C-005#72:2> Not a single penny came from government.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#73:2> The Hana PTSA Carpentry program ( the name students call it) was

open to students in grades 10 through 12.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#74:2> Participants enrolled either through one of Rutiz 's classes,

building/construction and industrial math, or they registered in Rutiz 's

after-school work program. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#75:2> Some students involved were identified as " at-risk" - needing

special attention because of poor classroom performance.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#76:2> Others needed a positive role model in their lives or found they did

better in school outside the traditional classroom setting.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#77:2> Some were successful students who wanted to learn carpentry. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#78:2> Without a real classroom, Rutiz met with students on a grassy

area where their first project was to be built. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#79:2> " It was hands-on from day one," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#80:2> He showed his students how to apply math and science in real-life

situations.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#81:2> They talked about the goals of each project they were to take on and

discussed everything needed to make it happen from tools to materials. Once

projects got under way, students used class periods and after-school time to

earn real money -

&dollar;10 an hour, of which

&dollar;4 had to be used to purchase their own tools.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#82:2> In less than four months, the students completed their first

project: a fully wired, 12- by 16-foot naturally ventilated office/classroom.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#83:2> Former Maui District Superintendent Paul Brown called it " the most

beautiful classroom in the whole district." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#84:2> The building features a custom Polynesian design with an

open-beam ceiling, koa wainscot and trim, an inlaid hardwood floor and

wraparound recycled plastic deck.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#85:2> Outside walls include a mural designed by one of the students. Since

they completed that first project last December, the students have built a

1,200-square-foot custodial complex that features a lunchroom and kitchen,

storage space, shop work area, and a sink with tile designs created by the

students.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#86:2> The project included 1,000 feet of concrete slab for the

floor.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#87:2> Other on-campus construction projects included custom-built

classroom bookshelves, room dividers, a storage facility roof and a koa

display cabinet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#88:2> Rutiz 's program is also helping to build pride in the school.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#89:2> Hana High School Principal Melanie Coates said she noticed a

decrease in incidents of student misbehavior on campus over one year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#90:2> She attributed improvement in campus attitudes to the carpentry

program. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#91:2> " It 's more than keeping them busy; the students are really

engaged, and they're learni 'requality craftsmanship," she said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#92:2> With four different vice principals coming through the campus

this year, Coates said students had a " window of opportunity" to cause

chaos.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#93:2> " But they didn't," she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#94:2> And instead of being bogged down with discipline issues, Coates

said administrators were able to focus on " moving the school to higher

ground."
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#95:2> Parents of students in the program have been especially pleased.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#96:2> Armine Medeiros, who works in the Hana School office, said she 's seen

a change in her 15-year-old son Ikaika. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#97:2> " Attitude wise, he 's really become humble," Medeiros said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#98:2> " He just grew up all of a sudden.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#99:2> He 's matured." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#100:2> Medeiros gives all the credit to the carpentry program and to

Rutiz.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#101:2> " This is one good program.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#102:2> I just love it…<ICE-USA:W2C-005#>I praise Rick; my boy 's just different now, and

it 's great." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#103:2> The Medeiros family, by coincidence, is in the process of

constructing its own home in Hana.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#104:2> Ikaika 's gotten very involved in the project.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#105:2> " He helps his dad measure things, and he tells his dad he wants to

help out.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#106:2> His dad tells him: 'Go for it.'"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#107:2> Other parents praised Rutiz and the carpentry program through

written endorsements submitted with appeals for donations and for grant

requests.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#108:2> " It is a real joy as a parent to have my son come home from school

excited about learning, and wanting to share with me what he has learned in

Mr. Rutiz 's class," wrote parent Fawn Elder.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#109:2> She described Rutiz as a very talented craftsman " with a special

gift of being a great teacher who has the ability to motivate students who

might otherwise lose interest." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#110:2> Elder said Rutiz teaches how to work and cooperate, as well as

carpentry skills.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#111:2> " My wish is for Mr.Rutiz to able to continue what he has started at

Hana High school, and to be an example for other schools to start such

programs." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#112:2> Elder told The Maui News she hopes her 11th-grader Benel will

enroll in the program again this fall and plans to encourage her other son,

Ola, who will be a sophomore, to take Rutiz 's classes as well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#113:2> Hana parent Gena Sansone wrote that her son, Nick, had been

losing interest in school until he enrolled in Rutiz 's class. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#114:2> " Nick has learned so many important skills in this class, he

could go out today and be a contributing, valuable worker on any construction

crew," Sansone said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#115:2> " Because of this program, Nick now has talents that will translate

into a job, money, confidence and satisfaction." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#116:2> Students also had positive comments about the program, noting

them in a brochure they designed to be used for fund-raising purposes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#117:2> " This shows all the smart people sitting in class that we' 're

smart, too," wrote one student.
<ICE-USA:W2C-005#118:2> " Let 's see you guys come out and do this." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-005#119:2> " This class has helped me feel more confident; now I 'm learning

something I know I can use in my life," another student wrote.</p> </I>
