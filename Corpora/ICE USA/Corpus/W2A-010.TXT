<ICE-USA:W2A-010#4:1> <h> III</h>

<p> In the above discussion I have occasionally alluded to reasons why

aestheticians find supervenience an appealing notion.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#5:1> Now I should like to show in more detail how it has figured in three

papers specifically dealing with aesthetic supervenience.</p>

<p> Philip Pettit titles his paper <quote>  The Possibility of Aesthetic

Realism,"12 thereby making it clear that the <quote>  work </quote> he

wants to do is to provide a basis for proving or rationally justifying

aesthetic attributions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#6:1> He begins by making three observations about aesthetic attributions, (

he uses the term <quote> " aesthetic characterization"</quote>).
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#7:1> First he claims that they are not the same as pictorial attributions,

e.g., color descriptions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#8:1> ( I have always been puzzled by the fact that many theorists assume

that color statements are not aesthetic.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#9:1> I find it quite normal for people to report preferences for and

appreciation of certain colors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#10:1> " I like that shade of green that permeates the world the first few

weeks of spring, </quote> seems perfectly aesthetic to me.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#11:1> So does, <quote>  It 's the red that is so dramatic.? </quote> But

perhaps Pettit and others, would deny that these are, strictly speaking, <it>

descriptions </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#12:1> In any case, if this observation is not to be question-begging, it

needs more discussion.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#13:1> ( I will have more to say on this later.)
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#14:1> Secondly he asserts that aesthetic attributions are <quote>

relatively primitive,</quote> that is, <quote> if a characterization

applies to one work, then it applies to any which, subject to rectification

for colours, is observationally indistinguishable from that work; there is no

possibility of an unobservable difference affecting how the works are

respectively characterised."13
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#15:1> ( I am not sure what the phrase <quote> subject to rectification for

colours</quote> implies here.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#16:1> Does Pettit believe that colors can vary without aesthetic properties

changing<ICE-USA:W2A-010#>If so, I think he needs to provide some examples to show that

this is so.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#17:1> On the face of it, one would think that color-alterations would

affect enormous changes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#18:1> Perhaps I just don't understand <quote> rectification."</quote>)
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#19:1> Third, aesthetic attributions, according to Pettit, supervene on

pictorial characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#20:1> <quote> " The indiscernibility of any two works with respect to their

pictorial characterisations entails their aesthetic indiscernibility;

equivalently, there cannot be an aesthetic difference between two works

unless there is also a pictorial one."</quote>14
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#21:1> I shall later argue that this last claim is false, or at best trivial

or misleading.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#22:1> Pettit goes on to show that there is a version of aesthetic

realism consistent with these three observations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#23:1> As on Blackburn 's analysis, supervenience, coupled with

non-entailment, creates a problem for the aesthetic realist.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#24:1> Pettit, assuming that aesthetic properties supervene on non-aesthetic

ones, must fiddle around with <it> entailment </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#25:1> His own strategy involves showing how the apparent <quote>

quasi-assertive</quote> nature of aesthetic statements ( in Crispin

Wright 's sense where evidence presented cannot fail to command agreement

unless the statement is misunderstood) disappears when one fully understands

the role of perception in aesthetic attributions.15
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#26:1> But such tinkering would perhaps not be necessary if the machinery of

supervenience were not considered a necessary tool for doing the work at

hand.</p>

<p> In <quote> Aesthetic Supervenience,</quote> Jerrold Levinson also

assumes that aesthetic properties are supervenient.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#27:1> His goal is to explain the particular form that this supervenience

takes, and he opts for this: <quote> (AS): Two objects ( e.g., art-works)

that differ <it> aesthetically </it> necessarily differ <it>

non-aesthetically </it> ."</quote>16
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#28:1> That is, there could not be two objects that were aesthetically

different yet non-aesthetically identical-fixing the non-aesthetic properties

of an object fixes its aesthetic properties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#29:1> Levinson then posits three kinds of non-aesthetic properties as the

bases upon which aesthetic ones supervene: perceivable, non-perceivable, and

contextual.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#30:1> He couples supervenience with emergence ( instead of reductionism or

condition-governed-ness)
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#31:1> In order to provide a foundation for proving or rationally justifying

the attribution of the aesthetic properties that seem to him so ontologically

different from the non-aesthetic ones that one refers to in these proofs and

justifications.</p>

<p> Justification - - getting from non-aesthetic to aesthetic properties in

the absence of laws-- is John Bender 's main concern in <quote> Supervenience

and the Justification of Aesthetic Judgments.</quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#32:1> He increases the number of observations from Pettit 's three to six--

describing them as <quote> common fare for aestheticians."</quote>17
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#33:1> They probably are common fare, and this is one reason that aesthetics

is often so muddled, I think.</p>

<p> The first <quote> commonplace</quote> is that <X> <quote> artworks and

other aesthetic objects have both descriptive, structural, perceivable

properties, such as certain lines, colors, notes, sentences, chemical

properties, etc., and aesthetic properties, such as balance, unity,

tranquillity, poise, charm, coherence, energy, grandness of design, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X34:1> Pretty clearly, when conceived as universals, aesthetic properties

are not identical to non-aesthetic ones."</quote></X>18 I do not accept this

a priori distinction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X35:1> As I suggested above, I think color, for instance, may be an

aesthetic property.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X36:1> The line between <quote> design</quote> and <quote> grandness of

design</quote> is certainly fuzzy, I believe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X37:1> The <quote> etc.</quote> at the end of the lists of both aesthetic

and non-aesthetic properties Bender provides is typical of aesthetic writing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X38:1> The assumption is that all readers know exactly how to go on-- but

I, for one, do not.</p>

<p> Bender 's next two claims do seem correct to me.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X39:1>
#2. Two objects with different non-aesthetic properties can be described by

the same aesthetic term.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X40:1> Both wine and music can be balanced, for example.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X41:1>
#3. <quote> " There are, at least in general, no logical equivalences between

aesthetic and nonaesthetic predications.</quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X42:1> I also grant
#6.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X43:1> <quote> " The most common and <it> apparently </it> most forceful

strategy for justifying aesthetic judgments ...
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X44:1> is to cite those nonaesthetic properties of the thing which one

believes are responsible for or result in the work 's having the property one

has claimed for it." </quote> 19</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#X45:1> I disagree strongly, however, with commonplaces
#4-- <quote> Short of imagining vast and general alterations in human

sensibilities, in order to change the aesthetic properties of any work it is

necessary to change at least some of the nonaesthetic properties of that

work</quote> - - and
#5-- <quote> Necessarily, if two artworks were to have precisely the same

physical and sensory properties, they would have the same aesthetic

properties."</quote>20
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X46:1> It is because I deny both of these that I am dubious about

supervenience 's doing much aesthetic work, for Bender, correctly, believes

that together they provide an imprecise, but nevertheless close, statement of

aesthetic supervenience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X47:1> I believe that aesthetic attributions are culture-bound.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X48:1> Thus I do not have to believe that someone must differ <quote>

sensibly"</quote> from me to grant that he or she may apply different, even

contradictory aesthetic terms to the same object or event.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X49:1> Even I myself may, staying sensibly the same, come to apply

different or contradictory terms myself to an object whose non-aesthetic

properties are stable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X50:1> ( I shall expand upon this point below.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#X51:1> Using the notions of supervenience developed by Kim and

Blackburn, Bender goes on to develop a more precise statement of aesthetic

supervenience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X52:1> He includes in the set of base properties not only particular

non-aesthetic properties, but also their complements, for it is not only the

properties something actually possesses that matter For example, the elegance

of Brancusi 's <it> The Bird </it> does not just depend upon polished surface,

tapering curves, and seamlessness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X53:1> It also depends upon the fact that certain properties are missing,

e.g., being splashed with blood.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X54:1> Bender acknowledges that such an interpretation of supervenience

goes well beyond the properties usually or actually cited in justification,

that one must limit oneself to the <it> relevant </it> absent properties, and

that it is difficult to specify how to do this.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X55:1> Bender believes, however, that supervenience is necessary for the

objectivity of aesthetic attribution, and so is willing to tinker with it

until he has a version of it that seems to work.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X56:1> I do <it> not </it> think that supervenience is required, and so

believe this whole messy and difficult ( and ultimately, I suspect,

impossible) task can be avoided.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X57:1> <h> IV</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#X58:1> Many of the distinctions listed in my opening paragraph do not

help one do the aesthetic work we want to do because they do not hold up or,

even if they do, they fail ultimately to tell us anything special about

aesthetic properties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X59:1> Supervenience, I shall now argue, does not help because the

distinctions it depends upon do not hold up.21</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#X60:1> Like reductionism or emergence, where one kind of property can

he defined in terms of, or comes forth from, another kind of property,

supervenience presupposes the existence of ( and usually ontological priority

of) some <it> base set </it> of properties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X61:1> Blackburn, for example, defines supervenience in this way: <quote>

Necessarily if x is F and G* ( a set of facts) underlies F then anything

else in state G* is also F."</quote>22
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X62:1> Here a <quote> set of facts</quote> <quote> underlies.</quote>

In other writers the base consists of a set of <quote> natural</quote> or

<quote> structural</quote> or physical</quote> or " descriptive</quote>

properties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X63:1> Aestheticians have used all of these terms, but usually simply think

in terms of the base as <quote> non-aesthetic.</quote> So Blackburn 's

version becomes, <quote> Necessarily if a is A and N underlies A, then

anything else that is N is also A.</quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X64:1> But even Blackburn acknowledges a general problem with

supervenience. <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X65:1> " Of course, G* can contain all kinds of relational truths about the

subject, truth about other things, and so on.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#X66:1> In fact, one of the difficulties about thinking about all of this

properly is that it rapidly becomes unclear just what can be allowed in our

conception of the totality of 6* states." </quote> </X> 23
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#67:1> Is the century in which an object is produced part of G* or N?
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#68:1> If so, the apparent supervenience of properties like being realistic,

exciting, graceful, or even beautiful begins to come into question.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#69:1> I shall say more about this shortly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#70:1> Statements of supervenience that do not explicitly mention two

ontologically different sets ( these tend to be early, non-formal

articulations)nonetheless typically provide a <quote> test</quote> that

supposedly enables one to make a distinction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#71:1> The test can he stated as follows:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#72:1> TEST: If one can imagine two objects or events identical in all

respects except that one has property P and the other does not have property

P, then P is not supervenient; if one cannot imagine two objects or events

identical in all respects except that one has property P and the other does

not have property P, then P is supervenient.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#73:1> This test invites one to play a kind of <quote>

Can-you-can't-you</quote> game.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#74:1> In the early days philosophers such as Hare believed that <quote> I

can't</quote> marked off evaluative ( aesthetic and ethical) properties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#75:1> Recently, as we have seen, they have been forced to admit that

<quote> I can't</quote> does not provide an identifying mark of the

evaluative, but accounts for a variety of <quote> " mysterious</quote>

connections.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#76:1> Let us play a simple version of the game.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#77:1> Imagine two coffee mugs exactly alike in all respects except one.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#78:1> Which properties can one do this with, and which can't one do this

with<ICE-USA:W2A-010#>Initially one might provide these lists of <quote> " <it> CANS </it>

</quote> and <quote> <it> CAN'TS </it> </quote>:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#79:1> <it> CAN</it> owned by Queen Elizabeth II yellow holding coffee

now</#>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#80:1> <it> CAN'T </it> delicate holds twelve ounces shaped like a

duck<ICE-USA:W2A-010#></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#81:1> Writers who rely on supervenience to explain in the <quote>

mysterious</quote> relation that seems to exist between some properties

assume that everyone 's intuitions will match and that they will thus be able

to play this game without hesitation or doubt.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#82:1> But I find myself very quickly in a quandary.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#83:1> Where would <quote> is cylindrical</quote> go<ICE-USA:W2A-010#>On the one hand it

seems a <it> can </it> - - for one might at first think it possible to

imagine two coffee mugs of the same capacity, color, material, height, one

cylindrical, the other cubical.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#84:1> But wait: if the mugs have the same capacity then they must either

have different heights or different base widths.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#85:1> So <quote> is cylindrical</quote> must be a <it> can't </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#86:1> Or, in some ways, it 's a <it> can </it> , in some ways a <it> can't

</it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#87:1> The <it> cans </it> on the above list ( owned by Elizabeth II, etc.)

do seem right to me, but the <it> can'ts </it> begin to waver.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#88:1> If delicacy is a physical property, then it seems a <it> can't </it>

, but if it is a visual property, I <it> can </it> easily imagine two mugs

identical in all respects except that one is delicate according to Dick but

not according to Jane.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#89:1> Suppose the mugs are lead-based ceramic.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#90:1> Given different constitutions and susceptibilities, as Dick and Jane

drink out of the mugs identical in all respects, Dick might find his mug

poisonous, Jane might find hers nonpoisonous.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-010#91:1> Being poisonous, of course, like being to the left of or shorter

than, is a relative predicate ( not in the sense of being non-cognitive, but

in the sense of requiring two names or descriptions to fill out the

predicate).
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#92:1> So are many aesthetic properties, and thus supervenience fails to

help explain anything special about aesthetic proof or rational

justification.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#93:1> Just as we saw that it is not clear what counts as F(A) and what

counts as G*(N), it is not clear how one is to interpret <quote> in all

respects</quote> in the test.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#94:1> Does it or does it not include what Blackburn calls <quote>

relational truths"<ICE-USA:W2A-010#>The intuition behind supervenience is that when all

base properties remain stable, the supervening properties must remain stable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#95:1> All aesthetic attributions must remain stable if the underlying

non-aesthetic attributions remain stable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#96:1> But if relational truths ( " made in the sixteenth century,</quote>

or <quote> seen by Jane,</quote> for instance) are included in the base,

the test for supervenience breaks down-- and we are no longer in possession

of a helpful tool.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#97:1> Two objects particle-for-particle identical with one another viewed

by two persons particle-for-particle identical with one another viewed ( or

one person particle-for-particle self-identical on different occasions) in

two cultures particle-for-particle identical will be given the same aesthetic

attribution.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#98:1> This tells us nothing special about <it> aesthetic </it>

attributions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-010#99:1> It certainly does not distinguish them from perceptual, mental,

moral, scientific, religious, economic, or political attributions, nor tell

us how proof or rational justification can be carried out in the esthetic

realm if we thought there was a special problem there ( one that did not

exist, for example, in the scientific realm).</p> </I>
