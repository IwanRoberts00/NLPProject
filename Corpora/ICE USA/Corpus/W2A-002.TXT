<ICE-USA:W2A-002#1:1> <h> More radical than the comedy of satire and the comedy of nihilism,

the comedy of celebration references powerlessness as good - and the good in

powerlessness.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#4:1> The phrase <quote> philosophy of comedy </quote> has an ominous

ring to it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#5:1> It evokes an image of philosophy stooping to conquer yet another

dimension of human experience - bringing its sober light to bear on an

especially dark corner of the cave in which we dwell.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#6:1> Philosophy, as usual, assumes the position of the master term, and

reduces comedy to the status of an objective genitive.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#7:1> Philosophy has traditionally claimed this privileged position on

the ground that it alone can provide the ultimate rational explanation of the

experiences it scrutinizes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#8:1> The genitivity of the genitive in phrases such as <quote> philosophy

of religion </quote> and <quote> philosophy of art </quote> is meant to be

taken seriously: it implies that religion and art must turn to philosophy to

find their identity; it is the source of their seriousness and the progenitor

of their legitimacy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#9:1> Moreover, philosophy holds a monopoly on ultimate questions so that

its sovereignty over ultimacy seems to be beyond question.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#10:1> The <quote> philosophy of comedy </quote> suggests that, like

everything else, comedy is subject to philosophy 's authoritative

judgment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#11:1> This would, indeed, be the case - were it not for the fact that

comedy laughs until it cries at all the attempts made by philosophy to master

it.' As if there were any chance at all that philosophy might possibly have

the last laugh.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#12:1> As if the most laughable thing in the whole universe was not

philosophy itself, with its pretension to be ultimately serious, beyond

question, exempt from fallibility.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#13:1> What engenders laughter is philosophy 's very attempt to subsume

laughter, to silence it with philosophical seriousness, to deny the comedy of

its own performances.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#14:1> What is funniest of all is the humorless of philosophy itself, its

refusal to laugh at its own ridiculousness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#15:1> From comedy 's point of view, philosophy is never more hilarious than

when it is speaking seriously. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#16:1> To let comedy be, and not try to subsume it, in fact to allow it

its own voice, to let it play its practical jokes and make us the butt of its

merciless satire - this would be an alternative to the philosophy of comedy

in the conventional sense.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#17:1> But what if comedy, allowed free rein, turns out to have its own kind

of ultimacy, a syllabus of unavoidable banana peels, a tack to put under

every one of our assumptions?
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#18:1> This too would be a philosophy of comedy but under the regimen of an

entirely different genitive.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#19:1> I do not mean that comedy would itself assume a regal bearing and

presume to occupy the privileged position claimed by philosophy - for that

would be only to change roles and leave the old regimen intact.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#20:1> I mean, rather, that comedy may be able to generate a philosophy that

eschews all privilege and is permeated by the sense of the ridiculous; a

philosophy, yes, because it would be ultimate and impossible to transcend -

not, however, by virtue of the heights to which it would be brought by a

comic deconstruction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#21:1> It is a philosophy of comedy in this sense I would like to explore

here.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#22:1> <h> 1</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#23:1> Let us begin with satiric irreverence, with the body announcing

its noises on those occasions when it is supposed to completely efface

itself: the body full of sound and fury, and apparently signifying nothing.2
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#24:1> Ordinarily, we try to make our sounds conform to the etiquette of

sense so that they inconspicuously and deferentially serve our meanings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#25:1> Even in music sound does not come into its own but surrenders to

rhythm, harmony, melody - unless someone is listening to P. D. Q. Bach who,

by striking the exact wrong note, lets sound stand out, naked and

preposterous, with all its absurdity revealed.3
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#26:1> Just the body is not visible when we see the other 's face, even when

there is no make-up to dissemble its natural surface; the face itself

disguises the body - until something like Cyrano 's nose or the gap between

Letterman 's teeth reveals it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#27:1> We cover up the parts of the body which are so bodily that it is hard

to reduce them to sense at all, or make them serve any signifying purpose.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#28:1> But the body never quite holds together, even when subjected to the

most exacting surveillance of diet and exercise; no aerobic prevents its

fated excretions or unbidden erections.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#29:1> Still, the higher, the more important our signifying purposes,

the graver, the more compelling is the exigence to overcome the gravity of

the body: before any sacred event begins, it is surrounded with a taboo

against sound of any sort - a sacral silence which spectators and

participants alike feel compelled to respect.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#30:1> But, as children are especially quick to sense, this silence, even if

not broken inappropriately, is itself on the verge of being funny: in part

because of the incongruity between this sudden seriousness and our ordinary

manner, but primarily because, in assuming this etiquette, we aspire to a

seriousness that is beyond us.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#31:1> The manners incumbent on us as we enter sacred space for wedding and

funerals - the special garb, the dignity of ritual movement, the solemn grace

of ceremony - all serve to eliminate any hint of the slippery and awkward

body, of its excesses or frailties, its feckless demands and inescapable

incompetencies.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#32:1> But we cannot keep a straight face when we chance to see the

preposterous body at the very moment when we are trying to take ourselves

more seriously.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#33:1> The minister who stutters through the marriage ceremony in <it> Four

Weddings and a Funeral </it> is so discombobulated by the seriousness of the

occasion that he makes a travesty of it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#34:1> What is funny in all such situations is the incongruity4 between our

earnest solemnity and the very body by virtue of which it must be enacted.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#35:1> The body is not an instrument we can replace or a symbol we can

contest; it is inescapably <it> us </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#36:1> The ridiculousness of the very body which performs our most solemn

rituals profanes them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#37:1> There is no liturgy that is not liable to decompose into comedy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#38:1> Unable to detach from the body, we can never feel that the

seriousness with which we take ourselves is wholly safe and secure.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#39:1> The satirist, ombudsman of the ridiculous, pulls the ground up

from under the feet of those authorized to insure that the sacred is

reverenced and not blasphemed: the comedian reveals, to these authorities and

to us, that they too not only have bodies but they are subject to their

incompetencies, can fall and are as fall-ible as those subject to the

institutions over which they preside.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#40:1> Lear 's fool would love to turn Shakespeare 's play into a comedy by

exposing his king 's repressed absurdities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#41:1> No one who purports to exercise power on behalf of sacred order is

exempt from such absurdities, not even those most held up for veneration in

the sanctuary, the capitol, the academy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#42:1> These places could be kept wholly sacrosanct only if everything

ridiculous - and this means every human - were excluded from them; those who

preside over them must try harder than anyone else to disassociate themselves

from the ridiculous precisely because the most obvious of incongruities might

be that someone incompetent fully to control his own bowels should be our

paragon - our founding paradigm of wisdom, through whom the ultimately sacred

becomes accessible to us.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#43:1> Similarly, it is ridiculous, as Kierkegaard reminds us, for a man to

plight his eternal troth to the beloved, whom he is unworthy to touch, by

presenting to her his body when it is in the most preposterous of all its

conditions.5</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#44:1> We laugh at these incongruities because we appreciate them as

such and get their painfully funny point.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#45:1> In<quote> <quote> high </quote> comedies like <it> Pygmalion </it>

and <it> The Misanthrope </it> , the incongruity may not be caused by any

overt bodily affront but turn on some vulnerability that threatens to bring

<quote> low </quote> the ( usually male) protagonist; and even the lowest

comedies, such as <it> Animal House </it> , depend on our appreciating what

it is that the crudities of the body profane.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#46:1> It is not the body which gets the point, even when the point is most

literally the preposterous idea that mind can be master of the body.6
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#47:1> Indeed, because normal intelligence is so easily taken in by

conventional assumptions that it is incapable of suspecting the

incompetencies and frailties they disguise, it takes not just the

eccentricity of genius but the peculiar genius of eccentricity to hit the

funny bone at exactly the right angle, to spring the punch line at just the

right moment, with exactly the right inflection.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#48:1> This is a kind of prudence that ethics traditionally overlooks

because what, from the comic point of view, is the <quote> right </quote> act

at the <quote> right </quote> time in the <quote> right </quote> way is

always, from the viewpoint of conventional morality, an impropriety, the one

thing not to be done.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#49:1> Hence the unnerving perversity of the comic, the freakish character

of its Gumpish genius, the dangerous, anarchic - Groucho Marxist- import of

its wisdom.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#50:1> But wisdom, nevertheless: because the comic cuts so close to the

bone, makes us realize the very things we were determined to deny or

overlook, exposes us at the very points where we are most vulnerable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#51:1> Having located them, it does not hesitate to inflict a wound, even a

mortal one.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#52:1> Or especially a mortal one, as in <it> She Stoops to Conquer </it> ,

where Miss Hardcastle sets out to expose the very flaw, fault, incompetence,

fallibility that Marlowe has spent his life trying to overcome or repress.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#53:1> What gives comic wisdom its ultimacy, makes it wisdom and not mere

wit or cleverness, is that it shows no mercy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#54:1> It does not stop at reminding the mind of the body: it reminds us

that our being as a whole is liable to nothingness and has no escape from it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#55:1> The black comedy of Beckett exposes the ultimate and most

preposterous incongruity - that we, who would be being, who presume to be

being itself, are not just the mercy of nothingness, but are ourselves no

more than little bits of nothing.7</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#56:1> This means that satiric irreverence thrives on the very

presumptions and pretensions it undermines.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#57:1> The ridiculous is parasitic upon our higher sense, and absurdity

depends on the meanings we take seriously.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#58:1> The humor is not the banana peel but in the sight of the Hegelian

slipping on it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#59:1> Comedy 's incongruities are deconstructive, and deconstruction itself

is comic genius: not another theory in the conventional sense but comedy

carried into the inner sanctuary of philosophy to satirize philosophy that

takes itself seriously.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#60:1> Is such comedy itself to be taken seriously?
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#61:1> Is any comedy to be taken seriously or is doing so a ( comic)

misreading of its meaning?
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#62:1> Does the brilliance of the deconstruction imply that the comedian

deserves exemption from deconstruction?
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#63:1> Or is comedy a deconstruction from which nothing, not even the

comedian, is meant to be exempt?</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#64:1> <h> 2</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#65:1> Let us consider this last possibility.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#66:1> It requires that comedians laugh at themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#67:1> Here, the eccentricities of comic logic are complicated by the

peculiar paradoxes of self-reference.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-002#68:1> It is sometimes claimed that self-referential statements are

semantically incoherent, and that a statement about language, in order to be

coherent, must belong to a meta-language located on one level above the

language it is about.8
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#69:1> If this were the case, it would be possible to be radically critical

of oneself only by differentiating oneself from, and raising oneself above,

the self being criticized.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#70:1> What an attractive proposition: I will criticize myself by ...escaping

to a higher level.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#71:1> One could then get the jump on all one 's possible critics by making a

meta-move on oneself, and in the process end up in an even higher position

than that occupied before.
<ICE-USA:W2A-002#72:1> By distinguishing the critic in myself from the self being

criticized, the deconstructionist from the deconstructed, the wry ironist

from the object of my ironies, the person who laughs from the person who is

laughed at - even though they both occupy the same body - I am able to laugh

at myself in a way that <it> improves </it> my stature.</p> </I>
