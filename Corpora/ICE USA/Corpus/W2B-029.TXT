<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#1:1> For 160 million years reptiles flew above the Earth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#2:1> For just over 200 years we humans have known something of their

existence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#3:1> But only recently have we really begun to understand their lives--or

their looks.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#4:1> THE FOSSIL SKULL sitting on Alexander Kellner 's worktable makes no

sense.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#5:1> Usually fossils are spark plugs in the engine of the imagination.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#6:1> One look at the long, gently curved bones of a spider monkey 's arm and

you see a graceful swing from branch to branch; one glance at the weighty leg

bones of a mastodon and you hear the rumble of a heavy stride.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#7:1> But this skull greets you with cognitive dissonance: all you see is

essentially a flat triangle of bone.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#8:1> " A paleontologist once came in here and said, ` What is that?'" says

Kellner, himself a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History

in New York.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#9:1> Slowly, though, with Kellner 's guidance, the details that will

give this triangle meaning emerge.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#10:1> There is a pair of large eye sockets midway along the skull, staring

out of a braincase the size of a child 's head; the straight, smooth daggers

in front now become a set of jaws.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#11:1> Most prominent on the skull is a crest of bone that starts at the tip

of the creature 's beak; it rises above the upper jaw, passes over and behind

the eyes, and shoots out behind the skull like an oar.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#12:1> The crest doubles the length of the skull, from two feet to four.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#13:1> How could any creature support such a burden?
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#14:1> " It was hollow," Kellner says simply, picking up a piece of the

crest to show how the bone is only a few hundredths of an inch thick in some

places.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#15:1> While the crest 's interior is now filled with rock, in life there was

only air.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#16:1> It 's all a little less confusing now but no less bizarre.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#17:1> This skull belonged to a pterosaur--an extinct flying

reptile--named Tupuxuara, and it is one of the latest additions to an

inventory of more than 100 pterosaur species known to paleontologists.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#18:1> Tupuxuara lived 110 million years ago in what is now Brazil.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#19:1> It had wings measuring 18 feet from tip to tip, over 6 feet longer

than the wings of the largest living bird, the albatross.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#20:1> Yet since many of its bones were as thin as its crest, it weighed no

more than 45 pounds.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#21:1> For the most part, Kellner says, Tupuxuara soared, but from time

to time it would flap its wings to stay aloft.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#22:1> With its sharp eyes it would scan the broad lagoons below for food.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#23:1> The fern-and-pine-lined shores of these lagoons were home to many

other species of pterosaurs, as well as dinosaurs, turtles, crocodiles,

birds, and amphibians.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#24:1> Most important to Tupuxuara, the lagoons were teeming with fish.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#25:1> With a few precise adjustments to its wings, it would dip down to the

surface of the water, pluck a fish, and gulp it as it flew away.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#26:1> If, in Kellner 's telling, this pterosaur 's behavior comes off as

remarkably birdlike, it is no accident.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#27:1> According to much of the newest research by the small number of

pterosaur enthusiasts worldwide, these extinct reptiles in many ways mirrored

the habits of their far more familiar successors in the sky.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#28:1> Pterosaur flight, the researchers say, was like that of birds down to

subtle details; pterosaurs played many of the same roles birds do in today 's

ecology, and pterosaurs may even have had birdlike social structures and

child-rearing techniques.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#29:1> Pterosaurs haven't always been seen this way; they weren't even

originally seen as denizens of the air.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#30:1> In 1784 the Italian zoologist Cosimo Collini, trying to make sense of

the first pterosaur fossil ever found, guessed that he was looking at a sea

creature--an amphibious mammal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#31:1> Early in the nineteenth century the French anatomist Baron Georges

Cuvier saw drawings of this fossil and quickly interpreted the animal as a

flying reptile, but his colleagues found that concept hard to swallow.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#32:1> Throughout the 1800s researchers suggested pterosaurs were everything

from extinct bats to flying marsupials.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#33:1> Eventually they seem to have reached consensus on the image of a

lizard that, while it didn't actually fly, did glide through the air on

batlike wings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#34:1> Part of their confusion stemmed from the pterosaurs' bones.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#35:1> Hollow and thin, they were perfect for flight but not for

preservation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#36:1> Only a few sites scattered around the world have yielded many

pterosaur fossils that aren't badly damaged.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#37:1> Generally they are found in slabs of limestone, greatly flattened and

most often fragmented.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#38:1> Now, however, beautiful pterosaur fossils are emerging from a

scrubby plateau in northeastern Brazil called Chapada do Araripe.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#39:1> The site itself isn't newfound.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#40:1> Two wandering naturalists discovered it in 1817, and paleontologists

have been hauling out fossil fish, amphibians, insects, and plants ever

since.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#41:1> But not until 1971 was the first pterosaur discovered at Araripe, and

most of the other pterosaur fossils there have been uncovered within just the

past ten years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#42:1> Fourteen new species, including Tupuxuara, have now been found at

Araripe, each dramatically different from all previously known

pterosaurs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#43:1> The Araripe pterosaurs are miraculously preserved.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#44:1> For reasons geochemists still don't fully understand, animals that

died in the lagoons of Araripe sometimes began to fossilize unusually

quickly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#45:1> In other ancient lagoons, bones that sank to the bottom were covered

in mud and gradually crushed as the mud accumulated and turned to stone.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#46:1> But when an animal died in the Araripe water, it was quickly coated

with a layer of sediment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#47:1> Layer after layer of limestone built up on the bones, encasing them

in large, round nodules.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#48:1> How quickly the nodules formed is hard to say, but judging from the

presence of fossilized muscle and sometimes even bacteria on the skin of

Araripe animals, it could have happened within hours.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#49:1> It 's as if nature were packing away fine china for 110 million years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#50:1> When paleontologists unearth these pale lumps, crack them open, and

soak away the limestone, they often find fossils with unprecedented

three-dimensional detail.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#51:1> Kellner is one of the world 's experts on the Araripe pterosaurs,

and he doesn't conceal his pride in them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#52:1> " Paleontologists always like to say ` My fossils are the best,'" he

says, " but these really are the best.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#53:1>
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#54:1> Stafford Howse, a paleontologist at the University of London,

recently finished a study of a pterosaur skull from Araripe that is preserved

down to its ear bones.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#55:1> " If the thing had died six months ago," he says, " and been buried

in the soil for the worms and maggots to get to and had then been exhumed,

this is the condition it would be in.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#56:1> It 's perfect in every respect. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#57:1> As far as paleontologists can now determine, pterosaurs descended

from a small, lightweight bipedal reptile that lived perhaps 250 million

years ago, an animal that also gave rise to dinosaurs ( and thus, most

paleontologists believe, ultimately to birds) at around the same time.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#58:1> How pterosaurs evolved toward flight is unknown; they may have made

their first faltering attempts by leaping from the ground or by tumbling out

of trees.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#59:1> All researchers can say with certainty is that 225 million years ago

there were pterosaurs, which were fully qualified fliers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#60:1> THE FIRST PTEROSAURS were small, ranging from robin to sea gull

size.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#61:1> They generally had long, narrow heads filled with teeth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#62:1> Most notably they possessed a finger on each hand--their "

pinkie"--that was longer than their entire body; this outsize appendage

supported a wing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#63:1> Their other three fingers were perfectly normal and tipped with

claws.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#64:1> Trailing behind them was a long tail that, like the tail on a kite,

stabilized their flight.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#65:1> They probably ate fish as a rule, although some may also have eaten

insects.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#66:1> At some point on the evolutionary path from their cold-blooded

ancestors they must have become warm-blooded, because otherwise they wouldn't

have had enough sustained energy to fly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#67:1> Bolstering this notion, and giving strong hints of what they looked

like when alive, is a pterosaur fossil found in Russia in 1970 that shows

signs of a thick coat of fur.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#68:1> This standard pterosaur model persisted for 45 million years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#69:1> But around 180 million years ago a new version made its appearance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#70:1> These newer pterosaurs are called pterodactyloids ( from the name

given to the first member of the group found, Pterodactylus, or " wing

finger"; the older pterosaurs are referred to as rhamphorhynchoids).
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#71:1> Pterodactyloids manifested some significant changes:
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#72:1> Their long head grew still longer, yet, because it had lost some

bones in the skull, it became even more lightweight.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#73:1> Their neck became flexible and birdlike.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#74:1> They lost some or all of their teeth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#75:1> Most important, their tail shrank to a stump, making it useless for

stabilizing flight.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#76:1> The only way that tail loss can be explained, say paleontologists, is

by pterodactyloids' having developed more sophisticated brains capable of

stabilizing flight with quick, small changes to the wings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#77:1> For more than 30 million years pterodactyloids remained

relatively rare.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#78:1> But 144 million years ago, for reasons unknown, their primitive

relatives vanished, and at that point the pterodactyloids exploded into a

strange diversity of species.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#79:1> Some became enormous--one late species named Quetzalcoatlus was 39

feet across, making it by far the largest animal ever to fly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#80:1> Other pterodactyloids developed extremely peculiar heads: one species

had hundreds of bristles for teeth; another had a duck bill, another a spoon

bill.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#81:1> Many pterodactyloids had bizarre crests like upuxuara 's; some had

crests shaped like swords, others like keels.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#82:1> For all the hallucinatory appeal of pterosaur heads, however, it

is the creatures' method of flight that remains the central question for

paleontologists.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#83:1> Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to fly, and only two other

animals have since joined them in the air: birds and bats.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#84:1> By comparing the bones of all three creatures, paleontologists have

tried to draw analogies that might suggest exactly how pterosaurs flew.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#85:1> Judging from the bones in the shoulder region, researchers have

concluded that the extinct reptiles could have flapped their wings as

powerfully as a bird or a bat.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#86:1> Yet the analogies can go only so far.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#87:1> Bird and bat wings themselves are very different from each other.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#88:1> In birds, the wings are made of feathers with stiff shafts that are

rooted in the arms and the fused fingers of the hands.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#89:1> The wings of bats are made of elastic membranes that run between four

elongated fingers and reach all the way down to the feet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#90:1> By moving their feet and fingers, bats control the shape and tautness

of the wings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#91:1> Pterosaur wings, supported by that single outlandish finger,

could not have been really close to either of these models.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#92:1> Something had to give the wings support, to keep them from flapping

uselessly in the wind.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#93:1> Either the wings had to be stiffened internally or they had to be

tied down to legs or feet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#94:1> But we have no perfectly preserved soft-tissue fossil to tell us.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#95:1> The best clues come from 80 fossil impressions of wings left behind

in the mud.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#96:1> Unfortunately these tracings do not provide researchers with any

definitive answers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#97:1> Usually the wings became distorted and were pulled into unnatural

positions in death, and without exception their impressions are maddeningly

ambiguous.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#98:1> In many of the fossils it 's not even clear if the impressions were

made by a wing or by some other soft tissue folded into a provocative

position by accidental events.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#99:1> But since the nineteenth century, paleontologists, observing that

pterosaur wings looked as if they were made of a membrane like that of a bat,

have assumed that the creatures did in fact sport leathery wings that ran,

like a bat 's, from finger to feet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#100:1> For more than a decade paleontologist Kevin Padian, of the

University of California at Berkeley, has been vigorously fighting this view.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#101:1> " If you' 'rechoosing between the bat and bird analogy," he says, "

there are many more reasons to draw comparisons with birds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#102:1> Batlike pterosaur wings would show a clear attachment to the foot,

he says, perhaps with a notch in one of the bones, but he has seen none.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#103:1> A bat 's wing also has a tendon running along its trailing edge, but

there is no evidence of one in pterosaur fossils.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#104:1> There is evidence, however, of a different sort of structural

component.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#105:1> Paleontologists have long noted that some pterosaur fossil wings

bear thin parallel ridges.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#106:1> Peter Wellnhofer, the curator of the Bavarian State Museum in

Munich, argued in 1987 that these ridges represent tough fibers, possibly

made of the protein collagen, sandwiched inside the wing to provide

stiffness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#107:1> Recently, Padian and Jeremy Rayner, a zoologist at the University of

Bristol in England, found that the tips of pterosaur wings support this idea.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#108:1> Since bats have an elastic membrane that they pull tight, their wing

comes to a sharp point.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#109:1> But while studying a particularly well preserved pterosaur in

Germany, Padian and Rayner discovered that its wing tip forms a blunted

curve.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#110:1> Such a shape requires some internal stiffening, such as could have

been provided by fibers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-029#111:1> This pterosaur had been preserved in a belly-up position,

exposing the underside of its wings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#112:1> Padian and Rayner found that at the trailing edge some of the fibers

had apparently separated from the wing and were lying on top of it at an

angle, leaving behind corresponding grooves on the wing itself.
<ICE-USA:W2B-029#113:1> The way the fibers had frayed indicates that rather than being

sandwiched inside the wing, as many paleontologists had imagined, they lined

the underside like the ribbing of an umbrella.</p> </I>
