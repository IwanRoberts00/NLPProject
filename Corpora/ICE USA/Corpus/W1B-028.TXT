<ICE-USA:W1B-028#1:1> <h> Item 1. BUSINESS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#2:1> The Home Depot, Inc., including its subsidiaries ( " The Home

Depot" or " Company") is the leading retailer in the home improvement

industry.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#3:1> It operates " warehouse style" stores which sell a wide assortment of

building materials and home improvement products.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#4:1> At fiscal year end, the Company had 340 stores in 28 states and 3

Canadian provinces, with an aggregate total of approximately 35,133,000

square feet of selling space.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#5:1> Such stores average approximately 103,000 square feet of enclosed

space per store, with an additional 20,000 to 28,000 square feet of garden

center and storage space.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#6:1> The Company 's corporate offices are located at 2727 Paces Ferry Road,

Atlanta, Georgia 30339-4089, telephone number ( 404) 433-8211. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#7:1> The Home Depot 's operating strategy stresses providing a broad

range of merchandise at competitive prices and utilizing highly knowledgeable

service oriented personnel and aggressive advertising. Company-employed

shoppers regularly check prices at competitors' operations to ensure that The

Home Depot 's low " Day-In, Day-Out" warehouse prices are competitive within

each market.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#8:1> Since a majority of the Company 's customers are individual

homeowners, many of whom may have limited experience in do-it-yourself ( "

D-I-Y") projects, management considers its employees' knowledge of products

and home improvement techniques and applications to be very important to its

marketing approach and its ability to maintain customer satisfaction. Many

D-I-Y customers take advantage of " how-to" classes offered in The Home Depot

stores.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#9:1> Another segment of the Company 's business activity is the

buy-it-yourself ( " B-I-Y") customers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#10:1> The B-I-Y customer chooses products, makes the purchase and contracts

with others to complete or install the project.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#11:1> The Home Depot also devotes significant marketing, advertising and

service efforts toward attracting professional remodelers and commercial

users.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#12:1> <h> Products</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#13:1> Management estimates that during the course of a year, a typical

store stocks approximately 40,000 to 50,000 product items, including

variations in color and size.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#14:1> Each store carries a wide selection of quality and nationally

advertised brand name merchandise.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#15:1> The table below shows the percentage of sales of each major product

group for each of the last three fiscal years.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#16:1> However, these percentages may not necessarily be representative of

the Company 's future product mix due, among other things, to the effects of

promotional activities associated with opening additional stores.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#17:1> Also, newly opened stores did not operate through a complete seasonal

product cycle for all periods presented.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#18:1> The Company sources its merchandise from approximately 8,000

vendors worldwide, of which no single vendor accounts for as much as 10

percent of purchases.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#19:1> The Company is not dependent on any single vendor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#20:1> A substantial majority of merchandise is purchased directly from

manufacturers, thereby eliminating costs of intermediaries.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#21:1> Management believes that competitive sources of supply are readily

available for substantially all its products.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#22:1> Marketing and Sales</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#23:1> Management believes a number of the Company 's existing stores are

operating at or above their optimum capacity.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#24:1> In order to enhance market penetration over time, the Company has

adopted a strategy of adding new stores near the edge of the market areas

served by existing stores.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#25:1> While such a strategy may initially have a negative impact on the

rate of growth of comparable store-for-store sales, management believes this "

cannibalization" strategy increases customer satisfaction and overall market

share by reducing delays in shopping, increasing utilization by existing

customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#26:1> The Home Depot has continued to introduce or refine a number of

merchandising programs during fiscal 1994.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#27:1> Key among them is the Company 's ongoing commitment to becoming the

supplier of first choice to an assortment of professional customers,

primarily small- scale remodelers, carpenters, plumbers, electricians and

building maintenance professionals.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#28:1> The Company has reacted to the needs of this group by emphasizing

commercial credit programs, delivery services, new merchandising programs and

more efficient shopping through the Company 's Store Productivity Improvement

program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#29:1> The Company continued a Company-wide roll-out of an enlarged

garden center prototype.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#30:1> These centers which are as large as 28,000 square feet, feature 6,000

to 8,000 square foot house plant enclosures ( " HPE") or covered selling

areas providing year round selling opportunities as well as a significantly

expanded product assortment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#31:1> By the end of fiscal 1994, the prototype was in place in at least 244

stores.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#32:1> By the end of fiscal 1995, these enlarged centers should be in most

of the Company 's stores.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#33:1> The organization of the merchandising group was revamped during

fiscal 1994 to be more efficient and responsive to customers' needs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#34:1> Under the new structure, both product line merchandisers and regional

merchandisers report to division merchandise managers who have responsibility

for broad product categories, such as construction, decor, repair and season-

lawn/garden.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#35:1> The Company 's installed sales program is available in 332 stores

in 70 markets and is planned to be in all of the Company 's stores over the

next year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#36:1> There are approximately 3,400 installed sales vendors who, as

independent, licensed contractors, are authorized to provide services to

customers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#37:1> This program targets the B-I-Y customer, who will purchase an item

but either does not have the desire or ability to install the item.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#38:1> During the past year, the Company has continued its marketing

effort to support its sponsorship of the 1994 and 1996 Olympic Games and the

U.S. Olympic teams' participation at those games.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#39:1> In fiscal 1994, the Company unveiled a program to help pave the

Olympic Park in Atlanta with engraved bricks, and hired athletes to work in

its stores and offices while they train for the Olympic Games.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#40:1> The Company 's growing partnership with 29 key suppliers in the United

States and 26 in Canada is providing significant financial support for the

sponsorship.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#41:1> During fiscal 1994, the Company also announced its sponsorship of

the Paralympic Games, which will follow the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#42:1> Support of the Paralympic Games is symbolic of the Company 's

commitment to better serve those of its associates and customers with

disabilities. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#43:1> In January 1994, the Company opened its second Expo(R) Design

Center in Atlanta, Georgia.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#44:1> The Expo stores, located in San Diego and Atlanta, enabled the

regional merchandising staff to test a variety of upscale interior design

products and services.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#45:1> Due to strong customer acceptance of its Expo stores, the Company

plans to add Expo stores in Westbury, New York, and in Dallas, Texas, during

1995.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#46:1> The Expo stores offer approximately 125,000 square feet of selling

space plus 5,000 square feet of climate controlled garden centers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#47:1> During 1994, the Company also opened additional food service

facilities in certain stores.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#48:1> These facilities are an extension of the Company 's commitment to

total customer satisfaction, and are designed to provide customers and

employees with a convenient place to eat.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#49:1> The Company believes customers with limited amounts of time to

complete their shopping, especially customers with small children, may spend

more time in the store if fast food is available on site.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#50:1> The food service providers vary by market.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#51:1> On February 28, 1994, the Company acquired a 75 percent interest

in the Aikenhead 's Home Improvement Warehouse ( " Aikenhead 's") chain in

Canada.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#52:1> This 75 percent interest was purchased from the Molson Companies

Limited ( " Molson").
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#53:1> The Company has the right to acquire Molson 's remaining 25 percent

interest beginning in 2000.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#54:1> The Company is the managing partner of this partnership which

operates as The Home Depot Canada.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#55:1> During fiscal 1994, the Company began developing plans to open

stores in Mexico.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#56:1> Although the Company has begun building relationships with key

suppliers in Mexico, entry into this market will be cautious and slow.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#57:1> On a long-term basis, however, it is anticipated that success in

Mexico could lead to more opportunities throughout Central and South

America.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#58:1> The CrossRoads(tm) store format, announced during fiscal 1994,

will carry building and home improvement supplies sold at traditional Home

Depot stores, as well as a broad assortment of products and services for

farmers and ranchers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#59:1> By combining its traditional customer base with the markets in

farming and ranching communities, the Company anticipates being able to

penetrate hundreds of smaller markets that might not otherwise have supported

Home Depot stores.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#60:1> The first CrossRoads store is expected to open in Quincy,

Illinois during the summer of 1995, with stores in Waterloo, Iowa and

Columbia, Missouri expected to also open during the year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#61:1> The average CrossRoads store is expected to encompass more that

100,000 square feet, plus additional outside selling space of approximately

100,000 square feet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#62:1> " The Home Depot", the " Homer" advertising symbol and various

private label brand names under which the Company sells a limited range of

products are service marks, trademarks or trade names of the Company and are

considered to be important assets of the Company.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#63:1> <h> Information Systems</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#64:1> Each store is equipped with a computerized point of sale system,

electronic bar code scanning system, and a mini-computer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#65:1> These systems provide efficient customer check-out with an

approximate 90 percent of scannable products, store-based inventory

management, rapid order replenishment, labor planning support, and item

movement information.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#66:1> In fiscal 1994 faster registers were introduced as well as a new

check approval system and a new receipt format to expedite credit card

transactions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#67:1> Store information is communicated to home office and divisional

office computers via a satellite and land-based communications network.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#68:1> These computers provide corporate financial and merchandising support

systems.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#69:1> The Company is constantly assessing and upgrading its information

systems to support its growth, reduce and control costs, and enable better

decision-making.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#70:1> The Company continues to see greater efficiency as a result of its

electronic data interchange ( EDI) program.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#71:1> Currently, over 400 of the Company 's highest volume vendors are

participating in the EDI program.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#72:1> A paperless system, EDI electronically processes orders from stores

to vendors, alerts the store when the merchandise is to arrive and transmits

vendor invoice data.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#73:1> In fiscal 1994, the Company introduced phone centers to serve its

customers who call to inquire about pricing and availability of merchandise.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#74:1> By adding experienced sales associates to a phone bank to answer

calls quickly and efficiently, weekly phone sales have increased.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#75:1> Without the necessity of responding to phone calls, the sales

associates can better concentrate on serving in- store customers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#76:1> In fiscal 1994, stores were outfitted with Electronic Article

Surveillance ( " EAS") detectors that trigger an alarm if a person exits the

store with merchandise that has been affixed with an EAS label that has not

been desensitized at the cash register.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#77:1> The system is proving to be a deterrent to theft, with many stores

reporting reductions in shoplifting offenses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#78:1> The Company also operates its own television network and produces

training and informational programs that are transmitted to stores via the

communications network.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#79:1> <h> Employees</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#80:1> As of fiscal year end, The Home Depot employed approximately

67,000 persons, of whom approximately 4,800 were salaried and the remainder

were compensated on an hourly basis.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#81:1> Approximately 83 percent of the Company 's employees are employed on a

full-time basis.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#82:1> In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, the Company seeks

to maintain salary and wage levels above those of its competitors in its

market areas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#83:1> The Company 's policy is to hire and train additional personnel in

anticipation of future store expansion.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#84:1> The Company has never experienced a strike or any work stoppage, and

management believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#85:1> There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of the

Company 's employees.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#86:1> <h> Competition</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#87:1> The business of the Company is highly competitive, based in part

on price, location of store, customer service and depth of merchandise.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#88:1> In each of the markets served by the Company, there are several other

chains of building supply houses, lumber yards and home improvement stores.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#89:1> In addition, the Company must compete, with respect to some of its

products, with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores,

warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent,

other retailers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-028#90:1> Due to the variety of competition faced by the Company,

management is unable to precisely measure the Company 's market share in its

existing market areas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#91:1> Management, however, believes that the Company is an effective and

significant competitor in these markets. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-028#92:1> <h> Executive Officers</h>
