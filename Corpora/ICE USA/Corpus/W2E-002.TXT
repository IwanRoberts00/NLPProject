<ICE-USA:W2E-002#1:1> <h> The Primary Results</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#2:1> Tuesday 's primary election had more than its share of surprises

and close races.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#3:1> The voter turnout in the Savannah area - somewhere around 50 percent -

was encouraging as well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#4:1> The biggest shocker on the local scene was Joe Mahany 's upset of

incumbent Chatham County Commission Chairman Robert McCorkle in the

Democratic primary.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#5:1> Mr. McCorkle, who has served on the commission for 22 years, was

beaten by Mr. Mahany by nearly a 2-to-1 margin.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#6:1> The chairman 's defeat by members of his own party is a clear

indication that voters want a change in leadership.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#7:1> The victor, Mr. Mahany, will face one of two Republicans, Commissioner

Julie Smith or Ray Gaster, who were the top vote-getters in the Republican

primary.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#8:1> No matter who wins in the November general election, Chatham Countians

will begin 1993 with a new commission chairman on board.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#9:1> In other contests, the crowded fields in the 1st District and 11th

District congressional races virtually guaranteed runoff elections, which

will be held Aug. 11.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#10:1> Barbara Christmas, a Democrat, ran a strong campaign in the 1st

District and will face either Buddy DeLoach or Bryan Ginn in the runoff.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#11:1> That winner will run against State Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah,

who easily won the Republican nomination.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#12:1> In the newly-drawn 11th District, Cynthia McKinney and George

DeLoach will vie for the Democratic nod, while Republicans Woodrow Lovett and

Savannahian Michael Pratt will fight to carry their party 's flag.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#13:1> All four have an unenviable task, since this crazily configured

district stretches from Atlanta to Augusta to Savannah.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#14:1> In various judgeship races, Charles Mikell handily won the

election for Superior Court judge, proving that his experience on the State

Court bench paid off.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#15:1> State Supreme Court Justice Leah Sears-Collins, a Savannah native,

won her race to keep her seat, guaranteeing a measure of diversity on the

high court.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#16:1> One disappointment was the statewide race between Labor

Commissioner Al Scott and challenger David Poythress for the Democratic

nomination.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#17:1> Mr. Scott has been doing an admirable job as labor commissioner; Mr.

Poythress has been manufacturing issues and tossing mud.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#18:1> Unfortunately, the below-the-belt tactics apparently had an impact in

the three-person race ( Savannahian Frances Bright Johnson did surprisingly

well) and Mr. Scott and Mr. Poythress go into the runoff.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#19:1> On a more upbeat note, local voters wisely chose to return

Dorothy Pelote and Tom Bordeaux to the Georgia House.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#20:1> There, they will be rejoined by Diane Harvey Johnson, who had little

trouble reclaiming her old House seat.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#21:1> On the Chatham County Commission, Republican David Saussy turned

back former chairman Bill Stephenson 's bid to get back on the board in the

1st District.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#22:1> He goes on to face Democrat Marty Felser.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#23:1> Incumbent Deanie Frazier was the leading vote-getter in the 5th

District, but Democratic challenger Clifton Jones Jr. forced her into a

runoff.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#24:1> In the 7th District, Eddie DeLoach won his race and will follow in

the footsteps of his father, outgoing Commissioner James DeLoach.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#25:1> In school board races, congratulations are in order for

incumbents Daniel Washington and Andy Way and former State Rep. DeWayne

Hamilton.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#26:1> All three won their respective nominations, and Mr. Washington and

Mr. Hamilton will join the board because they have no opposition in the fall.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#27:1> Mr. Way, a Republican, goes on to face Democrat K.B. Raut.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#28:1> Credit is also due Tax Commissioner Barbara Kiley, who handily

won the Democratic nomination.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#29:1> She meets Republican Bill Atkinson in November.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#30:1> A final winner Tuesday was the voting public.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#31:1> Getting people to the polls for primaries isn't easy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#32:1> Yet, half the voters in Chatham County did their duty.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#33:1> That 's a positive trend.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#34:1> It 's also one that the public, and the politicians, should try to

build on through November and beyond.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#35:1> <h> President Should Settle Up</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#36:1> Some local Democrats are getting some cheap laughs at the expense

of President Bush, who still owes the city some

&dollar;14,000 for a campaign visit here back in March.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#37:1> Actually, that 's not too surprising.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#38:1> Most politicians are notoriously slow in paying their debts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#39:1> Sitting presidents are no exception.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#40:1> Still, it would behoove the president if he settled up with City

Hall sometime soon.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#41:1> While the delinquency isn't going to mean a thing to most voters, it

has to be a little embarrassing to his supporters.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#42:1> Besides, it 's not as if he 's strapped for cash.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#43:1> Published reports say that his campaign is sitting on a

&dollar;7 million surplus from his primary campaign fund that he has to spend before

the Republican convention, so as to qualify for federal campaign funds in the

general election.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#44:1> Coming across with

&dollar;14,000 for the city of Savannah should be painless.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#45:1> And while that 's not a lot of money to the city either, local

taxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bills for political rallies, no matter

which party stages them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#46:1> Thousands of area residents jammed the riverfront to see and hear

the president.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#47:1> He got its money 's worth for the pre-Georgia primary pick-me-up.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#48:1> Now he should finish the job and pick up the tab.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#49:1> <h> An Unpleasant Surprise</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#50:1> A month ago, Savannah seemed on its way to getting a 5-percent

cut in federal flood insurance premiums.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#51:1> That was welcome news for residents and business owners who could use

the discount.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#52:1> But lately, representatives for the Federal Emergency Management

Agency changed their mind.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#53:1> The agency says it won't cut rates because of " serious deficiencies"

in flood control here.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#54:1> Why the sudden turnabout?
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#55:1> And more importantly, how can it be resolved?
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#56:1> Taxpayers are spending millions of public dollars to improve drainage

in the community.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#57:1> Not so long ago, FEMA was applauding Savannah for some of the

measures it was taking to improve flood control and reduce the risk of flood

damage.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#58:1> Happily, it looked as though the investment would soon be paying off

through reduced insurance premiums.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#59:1> Now it appears the anticipated rate cut may be headed down the

drain.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#60:1> The feds are faulting the city for allowing five buildings - four

private homes, scattered from Coffee Bluff to west Savannah, and the Goodwill

Industries building - to be built below the nationally designated flood plain

without adequate protection.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#61:1> They also contend that several structures were given certificates

of occupancy before the elevation was formally established, as required by

FEMA regulations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#62:1> City Manager Don Mendonsa says this is the first he has heard

about any problems.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#63:1> He says all previous contacts with the agency had been positive.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#64:1> But Glenn Woodard, who works for the state Department of Natural

Resources and serves as FEMA 's representative, tells a different story.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#65:1> He contends that trouble was spotted last November, and that state

and federal officials have unsuccessfully prodded the city for months to make

corrections.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#66:1> It 's clear that a breakdown occurred somewhere.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#67:1> But what 's most important is to correct what 's wrong so Savannahians

can save a little money on their premiums.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#68:1> Mr. Mendonsa says he will send a detailed explanation to FEMA

about the buildings constructed below the flood plain.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#69:1> That 's a start.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#70:1> Perhaps the agency can be persuaded to change its mind.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#71:1> After that, city and FEMA officials need to do a better job of

comparing notes so that such unhappy surprises don't happen again.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#72:1> <h> Ugly Campaign Tactics</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#73:1> Responsible voters in Georgia have reason to be concerned about

the tone and direction of the state labor commissioner 's race.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#74:1> Al Scott, the incumbent labor commissioner, is the target of a

barrage of ugly charges from challenger David Poythress, who has wound up

opposing the incumbent in a runoff set for August.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#75:1> A Savannahian and a former state legislator, Mr. Scott has

performed capably at the Department of Labor, but you wouldn't know that if

you listen to his opponent.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#76:1> It is fair for a candidate to question his opponent 's

qualifications and competence.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#77:1> But Mr. Poythress goes well beyond that.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#78:1> He exceeds the limits of fairness.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#79:1> He emphasizes at every opportunity the race of Mr. Scott.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#80:1> This is blatant.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#81:1> There 's nothing subtle about it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#82:1> A black, Mr. Scott was appointed to his post by Gov. Zell Miller.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#83:1> He is the first person of his race to hold the statewide office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#84:1> In addition, Mr. Poythress claims Mr. Scott took a bribe.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#85:1> This is an unsubstantiated charge that is not borne out by the FBI

tapes Mr. Poythress claims are supportive of his allegations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#86:1> The tapes were made by an undercover agent operating a 'sting'

against another state legislator.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#87:1> The legislator, Rep. Frank Redding, has not been convicted.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#88:1> A mistrial was declared in his case.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#89:1> Al Scott was a government witness at the trial.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#90:1> He was not a co-defendant.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#91:1> If the investigators had evidence that Mr. Scott took money for

his vote, why wouldn't they have sought his indictment along with Rep.

Redding?
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#92:1> If they had suspected Mr. Scott, wouldn't they have gone to him and

tried to trap him the same way they set up a trap for Mr. Redding?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#93:1> Mr. Poythress also complained to the State Ethics Commission

about Mr. Scott, claiming the incumbent broke the rules on raising campaign

money.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#94:1> The commission dismissed the complaint.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#95:1> Ironically, Mr. Poythress is supported by the forces of former

Labor Commissioner Sam Caldwell, who was forced to resign his office under a

cloud of scandal and wound up spending time in jail.<ICE-USA:W2E-002#> Mr. Poythress

obviously is not as sensitive about his support as he is about Mr. Scott 's

alleged conduct.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#96:1> Political contests should be settled at the polls by citizens who

are not confused or misled by unconfirmed rumors and charges.<ICE-USA:W2E-002#> We deplore

this type of political attack whenever and wherever it is made.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#97:1> We hate to see it happening in Georgia.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#98:1> <h> Jones Falls; Newt Hangs On</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#99:1> Among those who got jolted in the Georgia primary voting was

Democratic Rep. Ben Jones, the former TV actor.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#100:1> Among those who got scared but escaped defeat was Republican Rep.

Newt Gingrich.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#101:1> Rep. Jones fared poorly in a Democratic race won by state

legislator Don Johnson.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#102:1> Mr. Johnson, chairman of the state Senate Appropriations Committee,

accused Rep. Jones of working for perks and privileges, voting against

voluntary prayer in school, and being out of touch with voters in eastern

Georgia 's 10th District.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#103:1> " The commercials and the rumors and things like that are as

tough as we've e 've faced," Mr. Jones complained.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#104:1> Yes, they were tough.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#105:1> But they summed up his House stint pretty well.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#106:1> He has been doggedly liberal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#107:1> Mr. Johnson, however, is not home free.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#108:1> He must still survive a fall contest.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#109:1> Newt Gingrich, the House minority whip and Georgia 's only

Republican in Congress, edged Herman Clark, a former state legislator who

ridiculed Mr. Gingrich for writing bad checks, voting himself a pay raise and

using a limousine.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#110:1> In this case, the criticism was also fair because Rep. Gingrich did

all those things.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#111:1> But he was not a major culprit in the House overdraft scandal, he

apologized for having been involved, and he voted to publicize the names of

all those who had written overdrafts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#112:1> He redeemed himself somewhat by properly supporting openness and

reform of the system that brought about the scandal.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#113:1> He also has given up his limousine.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#114:1> One of Mr. Gingrich 's prime virtues as a congressman is his

ability to put burrs under the saddles of the Democratic House leadership.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#115:1> For that reason, Democrats will work hard to beat him in the fall.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#116:1> But the minority whip 's abrasiveness doesn't void the fact that what

he says often needs to be said.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#117:1> Washington wouldn't be quite the same without him.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#118:1> <h> Keeping Up With Crooks</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#119:1> The days of the police six-shooters became numbered when more

criminals started packing semiautomatic pistols.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#120:1> The Chatham County Police Department is the latest to modernize.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#121:1> County police officers are being issued .45-caliber pistols,

which hold 8-shot clips, to replace their 5- or 6-shot .38 revolvers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#122:1> It 's good that officers will be less likely to be out-gunned.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#123:1> With more sophisticated hardware on the market, those who protect

and serve shouldn't be put at a disadvantage.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#124:1> <h> Still Needed: Great Orators</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-002#125:1> Great oratory is still missing from the presidential election

campaign.
<ICE-USA:W2E-002#126:1> Most of us who like it are still smarting from President Bush 's

lackluster State of the Union address in January.</p> </I>
