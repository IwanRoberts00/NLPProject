<ICE-USA:W2A-006#2:1> <h> Cruising for Feminine Discourse</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#3:1> For feminists, the claim of objectivity ( symbolized by

impersonality) is false and dangerous.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#4:1> Nevertheless, it is impossible for women to work in government,

industry, or the sciences, hard or soft, or to write discourse and expect to

be read by colleagues, to gain respect and get promoted, without learning and

using the abstract, impersonal, inexpressive discourse that is equated with

professionalism in our time.1</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#5:1> She must learn again to speak starting with I starting with We

starting as the infant does with her own hunger and pleasure and rage.2</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#6:1> In the beginning was not the word.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#7:1> In the beginning is the hearing.3</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#8:1> Listen.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#9:1> I will tell you a story.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#10:1> Once upon a time in the South of the states that are called

united, there lived a white child ( small child, girl child, brown hair,

brown eyes) who lived in a white house ( parsonage, home loaned, not owned)

with her white family and a black book.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#11:1> She had a red wagon The black book ( written by a white man) told

stories of truth, stories about a doll named Raggedy Ann, whose head was

thought to be stuffed with cotton, and her doll friends who talked and danced

and carried on with adventure when the <quote> real</quote> folks turned

off the light and left the room.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#12:1> The dolls--Beloved Belindy, the French doll, Uncle Clem, and

others--were owned and cared for by Marcella ( white girl, low curls),4 who

talked to them but could not hear them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#13:1> Into her own wagon Marcella lined up her dolls and pulled them around

the house, the conductor of a special train.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#14:1> She did all this between the pages of the big black book owned by the

child with brown hair, brown eyes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#15:1> One day the child was lonely.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#16:1> So she lined up her dolls in her own wagon ( wobbly wheels, rusty

handle): a panda bear, Ruthie, a ragged pink bunny, Smokey the Bear, Barbie

with a bubble-cut hairdo heavy that it cracked her neck and made her head

fall off.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#17:1> The girl pretended she was Marcella, trailing her train behind her up

the driveway, around the house, pointing out scenic spots and collecting

tickets as a good conductor does.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#18:1> At that moment the child became Marcella.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#19:1> In a moment of transference(transformation? transcendence?), the

edges blurred and she became what she read.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#20:1> <it> <quote> [N]othing less than our sanity and survival is at

stake in the issue of at we read.</quote> </it> 5</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#21:1> This a paper about women and rooms.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#22:1> They have wandered around in circles, confined to the narrow room

in which they've been given a 'veadly brainwashing.6</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#23:1> The garret was only nine feet long and seven wide.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#24:1> The highest part was three feet high, and sloped down abruptly to the

loose board floor.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#25:1> There was no admission for either light or air.7</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#26:1> He understood these things....
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#27:1> <quote> " I want to be big enough to contain whatever you must

be."</quote>8</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#28:1> There may, however, be something accurate about this repeated

dramatization of woman as simulacrum, erasure, or silence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#29:1> For it would not be easy to assert that [ the] existence and

knowledge of the female subject could simply be produced, without difficulty

or epistemological damage, within the existing patterns of culture and

language.9</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#30:1> As a child, I had a big book of Hans Christian Andersen 's fairy

tales with colorful, rich pictures of Chinese emperors, talking porcelain

figurines, the lovely and delicate Snow Queen, and flying swanmen.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#31:1> I read <quote> The Snow Queen</quote> and <quote> The Wild

Swans</quote> again and again, drawn to them for inexplicable reasons that I

can't even now completely understand. l</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#32:1> In <quote> The Wild Swans,</quote> a beautiful princess ( of

course) and her eleven brothers ( who were given swords and pencils while she

entertained herself with a picture book) are banished by their evil

stepmother when their father remarries.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#33:1> The princes' fate is to become white swans by day and men by night;

they can only return to the land of their birth for eleven days a year.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#34:1> After several attempts to get rid of the princess Elsa, whose

goodness tends to foil the plans, the stepmother-witch forces Elsa to flee to

the forest because her father doesn't recognize her after the queen has

blackened her face ( a face that horrifies Elsa when she glimpses it later in

a pool of water).
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#35:1> She catches up with her brothers, asks the conventional woman 's

question ( thinking only of them)--<quote>"how can I help to set you free"
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#36:1> </quote> ( Andersen, 127)-- and learns through a dream that she must

weave shirts for them made from nettles gathered in caves and cemeteries,

nettles that will burn and cut her as she crushes them and spins the flax

into thread.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#37:1> Until her task is done--and it may take years--she must remain

silent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#38:1> She is told in her dream by the Fairy Morgana ( whose kingdom changes

shape and whose borders have never been crossed by a man) that for her

brothers, <quote> life depends on your silence</quote> ( 133).
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#39:1> So, like Philomela, she learns to weave, suffer, and be still.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#40:1> Soon Elsa falls in love with a king whom she wants to tell

<quote> of her suffering, but knowing she must complete her task to free her

brothers, she remained silent</quote> ( 136).
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#41:1> <it> Hear me hear my silence </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#42:1> After many trials and tribulations, including being confined first in

a cave then in a room where she spins and weaves her shirts, Elsa is

proclaimed a witch because the king who has married her discovers that she

visits cemeteries at night.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#43:1> She will be burned at the stake.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#44:1> She weaves until the last moment, even as, <quote> garbed in

sackcloth</quote> ( 138), she is brought up to the stake, where the swans

suddenly surround her and she throws the shirts on them, freeing them and

turning them into men.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#45:1> <quote> " Now I can speak at last,</quote> she cries, excited to

tell her story to her husband-king who has never bothered to find an

alternative way to communicate with her but has promised, <quote> If you are

as good as you are beautiful I will dress you in velvet and satin, and I will

give you a castle to live in</quote> ( 134).
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#46:1> ( What more could a woman want?)
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#47:1> But on the returns to the castle to live ( allegedly) happily ever

after, no one questioning why a woman would want to live with a man who had

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-006#49:1> What does this story teach me, child of six?
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#50:1> Girls are expected to be good, to do what they're told ( a 'reit helps

to be beautiful).
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#51:1> Nothing should terrify a white girl more than discovering she has the

face of a black sister, as the narrative of the white community tells white

girls.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#52:1> A woman 's role is suffering, silence--in fact, men 's lives depend on

it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#53:1> Men get pencils; women have no words, no voice in telling their own

stories.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#54:1> If women behave properly, we will be given fine clothes, a good

house, and happiness, all contingent on our being gratefully heterosexual.
<ICE-USA:W2A-006#55:1> When we are not grateful for the ( pre-scribed) happiness that men

foist upon us, we may be deemed witches and burned at the stake--as was the

fate of so many real women in history--especially if we can weave mysteries

that men cannot.</p> <X> <quote> <it> Spinsters spin deeper into the
