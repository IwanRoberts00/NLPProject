<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#1:1> Wherein a neutron star invades, destroys, and rebuilds its

neighbor in slavish orbit, betraying itself only by a wisp of lithium.</p> <p
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#2:1> ASTRONOMERS AREN'T easily surprised by things astronomical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#3:1> They take black holes, curved space, quasars, and many other wonders

in stride.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#4:1> Yet Philip Charles of Oxford University had occasion to be nonplussed

during a recent astronomy meeting.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#5:1> He had just finished giving a talk on a fairly unspectacular

subject--the lithium content of certain X-ray-emitting star pairs--when he

was buttonholed by Philipp Podsiadlowski of Cambridge University.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#6:1> Podsiadlowski pointed out that Charles may inadvertently have found

the first evidence that a superdense neutron star can plunge to the core of a

giant neighbor, disrupting that star 's nuclear furnace and causing its vast

atmosphere to drift off into space, where the gas would clump together again

into a new and smaller star in orbit around the neutron-star invader.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#7:1> The lithium, said Podsiadlowski, was the smoking gun.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#8:1> As it turns out, he wasn't just daydreaming, and the weird

scenario he described wasn't entirely his invention.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#9:1> Some 20 years ago astrophysicists Kip Thorne of Caltech and Anna

Zytkow of Cambridge proposed that a neutron star that started out in orbit

around a red giant might eventually sink to the giant 's core.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#10:1> Although a neutron star is only ten miles or so across, its

gravitational pull is so strong that it could draw matter away from its huge

but more diffuse companion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#11:1> In the process, it would slow down, like a ship dragging an anchor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#12:1> Eventually the neutron star, in an ever-shrinking orbit, would plow

into the outer layers of its neighbor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#13:1> After a few thousand years it would spiral down into the star 's

center, demolishing the existing stellar core but leaving the rest of the

star essentially intact.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#14:1> A red giant that has been violated in this way has come to be called

a Thorne-Zytkow object--even though no one has ever seen one.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#15:1> Charles wasn't looking for one, either.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#16:1> Indeed, he was studying objects that are in some sense the opposite

of Thorne-Zytkows: X-ray binaries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#17:1> Instead of a neutron star orbiting a red giant, an X-ray binary is

believed to consist of a small ( sun-size) star orbiting either a neutron

star or that other species of massive invisible body, a black hole.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#18:1> As the massive object pulls material off its small companion, the

material gets so hot that it emits bursts of X-rays.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#19:1> " I was studying these systems because they contain our best

black-hole candidates," says Charles.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#20:1> While looking at the spectra of several X-ray binaries, Charles

found that they all contained unusually high amounts of the element lithium.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#21:1> This was unexpected: lithium is usually destroyed in nuclear

reactions deep within a star, and so the characteristic wavelength of light

it emits doesn't show up in the star 's spectrum.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#22:1> " We would have expected to find none," says Charles.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#23:1> But the presence of lithium made immediate sense to

Podsiadlowski, a theoretician who has thought a lot about Thorne-Zytkow

objects.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#24:1> He thinks what Charles has been studying are not the T-Z objects

themselves but star systems that are descended from them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#25:1> In fact, he thinks all X-ray binaries may arise in that way.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#26:1> Once a neutron star sinks to the center of a red giant to form a

Thorne-Zytkow object, says Podsiadlowski, the physics of the star changes

dramatically.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#27:1> Most stars have a large, hot core where energy-producing fusion

reactions occur.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#28:1> Above this burning zone is a convective layer where hot gases rise,

cool, and then sink back toward the core.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#29:1> A Thorne-Zytkow object, however, has at its center a ten-mile-wide

neutron star rather than a core thousands of miles across.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#30:1> Nuclear fusion still occurs in the hybrid--matter falling into the

neutron star gets compressed and heated enough--but only in a thin shell

around the neutron star, at the bottom of the convective layer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#31:1> According to Podsiadlowski, the different locus of burning in a

Thorne-Zytkow object explains why Charles saw his lithium.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#32:1> Although lithium is a normal by-product of fusion reactions in stars,

in most stars high-speed protons in the core slam into the lithium atoms and

transform them into beryllium ( which later breaks down into helium).
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#33:1> But in a Thorne-Zytkow object, Podsiadlowski says, fusion actually

takes place in the bottom layer of the convective zone, which allows some

lithium to escape before it can be converted into beryllium.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#34:1> Rising gases carry it to the outer layers of the star, where it

becomes visible.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#35:1> Eventually the feeble fusion reactor inside a Thorne-Zytkow

object fails altogether, and the hybrid can no longer withstand its own

gravity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#36:1> The outer envelope of the star collapses like a pricked balloon, and

part of it forms a lithium-enriched disk around the neutron star.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#37:1> Some of the matter in the disk, says Podsiadlowski, might coalesce

into a second-generation star in orbit around the neutron star, much the way

planets coalesced around our sun.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#38:1> The born-again star might then begin losing matter to its dense

neighbor again--resulting in just the sort of X-ray-emitting, lithium-rich

binary that Charles observed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#39:1> One great virtue of Podsiadlowski 's theory, convoluted and

outlandish as it sounds, is that it offers an explanation of where X-ray

binaries come from.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#40:1> Astronomers have had a hard time explaining how the small companion

in an X-ray binary could have survived while its larger neighbor exploded as

a supernova, which is the only way to make a neutron star.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#41:1> ( A neutron star is the dense remnant of the exploded star 's core.)
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#42:1> In Podsiadlowski 's scenario, the companion starts out as a red giant

so large it can withstand a nearby supernova explosion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#43:1> Only when it is later invaded by the neutron star does the giant die,

to be reborn later in smaller form.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#44:1> Charles himself does not buy Podsiadlowski 's theory.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#45:1> He has a less colorful explanation for the excess lithium: some of

the X-rays emitted by matter falling onto the neutron star, he says, strike

incoming carbon and nitrogen atoms, splitting them into lighter elements,

including lithium.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#46:1> But Charles admits that this explanation " ignores the question of

how the damned things"--the X-ray binaries, that is--"formed in the first

place.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#47:1> Thorne-Zytkow objects should forge a variety of strange elements

besides lithium, and if Podsiadlowski is right, astronomers might be able to

detect those other elements in X-ray binaries too.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#48:1> Until then Podsiadlowski may have trouble making a lot of converts to

his theory.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#49:1> " It 's certainly speculative, and many astronomers may find it too

speculative or exotic," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#50:1> " However, what you see is often more exotic than anything you've

ev 'vethought about."</p>

<ICE-USA:W2B-028#53:1> As federal and Montana state officials wrangle, the Park Service

becomes an unwilling accomplice in the slaughter of Yellowstone 's bison.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#54:1> </h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#55:1> <h> By Marvin Jensen </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#56:1> While Old Faithful may be the icon of Yellowstone National Park

and first on visitors' must-see list, wildlife--grizzly bears, elk, wolves,

and bison--is a close second.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#57:1> Bison--cows grazing with their cinnamon colored calves on cool, green

meadows, bulls bellowing during the fall rut in Hayden Valley or warming

themselves on thermal-spring mounds in winter-- stir the soul.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#58:1> Not surprisingly, then, the shooting and slaughter of more than

1,000 of these majestic animals last winter made national news.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#59:1> Media accounts, which blamed insufficient winter habitat, a disease

called brucellosis, and competing human interests, did little to improve

public understanding of the situation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#60:1> Within any given year, bison populations, just like any wildlife

population, increase each spring when young are born and decrease throughout

the summer, fall, and winter, as a result of natural mortality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#61:1> The bisons' numbers naturally fluctuate from one year to the next as

well, regulated by weather, forage, and predation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#62:1> Over the years, the Park Service 's policies have swung from

intense population management to nearly none at all.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#63:1> Today, the policy has evolved toward " natural regulation"--allowing

ecosystems to operate with as little human influence as possible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#64:1> This philosophy recognizes that while Yellowstone ( and other parks)

is not pristine, the ecosystem is as complete as is possible in today 's

world.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#65:1> Unfortunately, even at 2.2 million acres of land, Yellowstone

affords limited winter habitat for its wildlife.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#66:1> Bison and other large mammals, therefore, migrate outside the park

onto adjoining Forest Service and private ranch lands, staying sometimes into

the spring to calve.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#67:1> Last winter proved especially harsh in Yellowstone.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#68:1> Heavier-than-normal snowfall before Christmas was followed by several

days of rain around New Year.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#69:1> The rain saturated the snow, and the subsequent normal subzero

temperatures created a layer of ice as much as a foot-and-a-half thick over

most of the park.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#70:1> Bison and other grazing animals could not penetrate the ice in their

quest for forage.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#71:1> Exiting the park in unprecedented numbers to seek accessible

winter forage, the bison fell prey to the grisly provisions of an Interim

Management Plan, designed to protect cattle from the threat of

brucellosis.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#72:1> Brucellosis is a disease affecting bison, elk, and cattle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#73:1> It was first discovered in Yellowstone National Park in 1917; about

40 percent of the park 's bison now test positive to exposure to the brucella

organism, as does a lower percentage of elk.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#74:1> In cattle, the disease causes cows to abort their first calf, and

ranchers, the Montana Department of Livestock ( DOL), and hence, the governor

of Montana, are concerned that bison may transmit it to domestic

livestock.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#75:1> While it has been documented in experimental confinement, such

transmission has never been demonstrated in the wild.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#76:1> In the Jackson Hole, Wyoming area, cattle intermingle on summer

ranges and national forest lands with elk, up to 70 percent of which carry

the organism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#77:1> Ranchers there have vaccinated their livestock against brucellosis

for several decades, but the vaccines are just 65 percent effective.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#78:1> Nonetheless, there have been no reports of brucellosis being

transmitted from elk to cattle.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#79:1> However, a small herd of bison in the area that had tested

negative in two different years in the mid-1980s recently tested positive for

brucellosis.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#80:1> The only reasonable explanation is that the disease was transmitted

to bison from the infected elk.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#81:1> Given the uncertainty surrounding transmissibility, ranchers near

Yellowstone 's northern and western borders do not want to risk infection.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#82:1> In response to their concerns, the Park Service for several years has

been working toward a solution, through negotiations with the state of

Montana.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#83:1> An environmental impact statement ( EIS) and a long-term plan have

been in the works by the Park Service, the U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#84:1> Forest Service, and the Montana departments of Livestock and Fish,

Wildlife and Parks for a longtime- probably far too long.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#85:1> In 1995, while the review of the draft EIS was out for public

comment, the state of Montana filed suit against the National Park Service

and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS).
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#86:1> APHIS had threatened to revoke Montana 's brucellosis-free status

while bison from a herd exposed to brucellosis were allowed to cross park

boundaries into Montana.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#87:1> A court-approved settlement called for an interim plan and a

long-term plan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#88:1> The interim plan, now in effect, mandates: the sanction of bison on

federal land where there is no livestock; bison that have left the park at

West Yellowstone are to be captured and tested, with those testing positive

for brucella antibodies sent to slaughter and negative-testing, non-pregnant

bison released onto public land; and the Park Service capture of and delivery

to the DOL for slaughter any bison near the park 's north entrance that cannot

be prevented from straying onto adjoining private lands.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#89:1> Under the provisions of the interim plan, this winter and spring

near the north entrance to the park, 464 bison were captured and sent to

slaughter, 261 were shot by the Montana DOL, and 107 that tested negative

were corralled by NPS and recently released back into the park.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#90:1> Near West Yellowstone, 48 bison were captured and sent to slaughter,

while another 310 were shot by Montana DOL.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#91:1> The settlement, in essence, has made an unwilling partner of the

National Park Service in a management program that runs counter to its

mission, beliefs, and policies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#92:1> The basis for the management program lacks scientific support, yet it

appears to be the only course for working toward the Yellowstone bison 's

long-term protection.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#93:1> Meanwhile, that long-term planning process and the EIS ( which

will evaluate a range of alternatives) have been restarted, and according to

the settlement agreement, the draft EIS is to be available for public review

and comment by the end of July.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#94:1> The National Park Service believes that solutions exist.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#95:1> Some aspects of the problem can be resolved quickly, and some will

take a number of years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#96:1> For starters, given that the real risk of brucellosis

transmission from bison to cattle is relatively low, there should be an

increased level of tolerance for bison migrating to winter habitat on public

lands outside the park.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-028#97:1> Because the Park Service does not want to increase any real risk

of bison-to-cattle brucellosis transmission, it supports the establishment of

a hunt for a portion of the bison that migrate outside of the park.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#98:1> Montana already has such hunts for elk, deer, antelope, moose,

bighorn sheep, and other species.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#99:1> Wyoming 's bison program, instituted in 1996, is a successful model.
<ICE-USA:W2B-028#100:1> The solution must also address elk that carry the disease and would

most likely re-infect bison even if the disease were eliminated from their

numbers. </p> </I>
