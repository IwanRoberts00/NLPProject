<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#1:1> Frankfurt, Germany--Center stage at the auto show that opens here

today are a pair of little bubble-topped cars that represent a potential

industry breakthrough.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#2:1> The models whose unveiling this morning attracted about 2,000 auto

executives and journalists aren't pollution-free wondermobiles, or even

most-elegant Mercedes-Benz and BMW sedans.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#3:1> Instead, they're a pair of ordinary subco 'rects from Chrysler Corp.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#4:1> with an extraordinary mission: to become Detroit 's first small cars to

sell well, drive comfortably AND make a profit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#5:1> The new Dodge and Plymouth Neon are noteworthy this morning for

another reason: Their Frankfurt debut marks the first time one of the Big

Three first introduced an American-made car abroad.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#6:1> But then never before has a U.S. car counted on overseas sales so

heavily for its success.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#7:1> Successfully marketing small cars has been Detroit 's Holy Grail

for the past three decades.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#8:1> Not that there haven't been notable attempts--and flops.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#9:1> General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet Corvair attempted to copy the

rear-engine design of the popular Volkswagen Beetle, only to spawn Ralph

Nader and his book Unsafe at Any Speed.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#10:1> Ford Motor Co.tried to stem rising Japanese car sales with the Pinto.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#11:1> But court setbacks over fuel-tank explosions sank the Pinto

instead.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#12:1> American Motors Corp., which pioneered Detroit 's plunge into

small cars during the late ' 50s, produced one of the ugliest cars ever

conceived--the squat Pacer.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#13:1> Even the Ford Escort, one of the best-sellers in Ford 's history, has

failed to produce profits.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#14:1> Through it all, top Big Three executives were uncomfortable with

small cars and the modest profits they produced.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#15:1> And by producing unsatisfactory cars like the Pinto or the Chevrolet

Vega, Detroit merely fed the rush of young, affluent buyers to foreign

cars.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#16:1> " By creating awareness of the practicality, even pleasure, that

is inherent in driving a small automobile--and then marketing mediocre Vegas

and Pintos--Ford and General Motors were generating increased potential sales

for Volkswagen, Toyota and ( Nissan)," auto writer Brock Yates observed in

his 1983 book The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#17:1> Now, Chrysler is hoping to reshape the perception of America 's

small cars.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#18:1> To do, it is banking its recent string of comeback vehicles on the

Neons-as Chrysler describes them, " cute" four-seaters with roomy,

cab-forward interiors, standard dual air bags and peppy 2.0-liter, 16-valve

engines likely to sell for less than

&dollar; 9,000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#19:1> The car 's biggest drawback: It comes with only a three-speed

automatic transmission, while many of its competitors offer a more

modern--and often more efficient--four-speed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#20:1> The debut of the Neons caps a year in which the once-troubled

carmaker won raves for its new mid-sized sedans, sold Jeep Grand Cherokees as

fast as it could make them, prepared to thrust a bold, new entrant into the

U.S. pickup truck market and slashed its enormous debt.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#21:1> " With the recent positive view of Chrysler as a clever,

innovative, dynamic company, they're certainly trying 'remove that halo over

the Neon," said David E.Cole, director of the University of Michigan 's Office

for the Study of Automotive Transportation.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#22:1> " I think they're doing a good job 're it."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#23:1> Indeed, the Neons represent more than just additional new

products for Chrysler.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#24:1> The Neons are Chrysler 's first new subcompacts since 1978 's Dodge

Omni and Plymouth Horizon.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#25:1> When Neons start selling in the United States in January, the company

hopes they will win back long-lost market share from the Japanese.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#26:1> In Europe, the little car could play a big role in re-establishing

Chrysler as a mainstream automaker.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#27:1> Building the Neons " was really a counter-attack to get back what

we used to have," said Robert P.Marcell, Chrysler general manager of

small-car engineering and leader of the team that built the Neons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#28:1> But the Neons' most-notable achievement would be to make

money--or at least not lose it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#29:1> " In today 's very demanding auto industry, you really don't want

to do money-losing products," said Joe Caddell, Chrysler 's general product

manager of small cars.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#30:1> With subcompacts, that 's easier said than done, for reasons both

of necessity and choice.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#31:1> For one thing, small cars cost nearly as much to design and build

as larger cars.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#32:1> But bigger autos command proportionately bigger prices, producing

bigger profits.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#33:1> In the past, the Big Three ere willing to accept the trade-off

because the unprofitable small cars helped them average out the fuel economy

of their car lineups to meet federal standards.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#34:1> Small cars also inhabit a corner of the market that doesn't allow

much room for price hikes.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#35:1> " With 22 nameplates, it 's by far the most competitive segment in the

world," Marcell said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#36:1> Former Chrysler Chairman Lee A.Iacocca initially wanted to spread

the cost of building the Neons by getting Fiat 's help.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#37:1> " Iacocca was sort of the small car 's biggest advocate and biggest

adversary," Caddell said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#38:1> " It was kind of a love-hate relationship, like, " I'd really l 'de to

do a small car, but, damn it, I can't figure out why.'"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#39:1> Marcell and his team convinced Iacocca that they could build a

profitable subcompact if they dispensed with conventional thinking.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#40:1> They knew " if we did things the same way we had done things for the

past 20 years in Detroit, we would end up disappointed," Marcell said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#41:1> The result: Chrysler spent

&dollar; 1.3 billion to bring the Neons to market.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#42:1> By loose comparison, Ford a helled? out

&dollar; 6 billion for its Mondeo " world cars" and GM spent

&dollar; 5 billion to give birth to Saturn.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#43:1> Chrysler figures that difference means each Neon will cost about

&dollar;500 less to build than its close competitors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#44:1> The Neon team began by tearing apart rival models and talking to

hundreds of consumers to determine how to make a car that would address

buyers' two main beefs with subcompacts: They look unsafe and they're no fun 'reto drive.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#45:1> Following Chrysler 's " platform team" development concept,

designers, engineers, production planners, suppliers and line workers worked

together to trim costs while adding features normally not offered by

subcompacts.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#46:1> As a result, Neon will arrive in dealerships after a 31-month

gestation, beating the average Big Three development pace by more than a year

and rivaling Japan 's swiftness.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#47:1> " What the team tried to do is question every step of the way why

you do things and why they can't be done a different way," Caddell said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#48:1> " When you save

&dollar; 1.50 here and

&dollar; 2 there, it does add up."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#49:1> For example, the Neon planners counted seven different types of

fasteners that had been used to attach doors to door panels on the Plymouth

Sundance, Chrysler 's current small car.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#50:1> They decided the Neon would do better with just one type.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#51:1> " That means you've got one 'vepplier vs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#52:1> seven," Caddell said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#53:1> " You've got one 'vex ( of parts) on the assembly line vs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#54:1> seven.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#55:1> You've got one 'verque wrench at one torque setting instead of seven.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#56:1> You eliminate the cost of putting the wrong screw in the wrong

hole."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#57:1> Chrysler saved

&dollar; 25 to

&dollar; 35 a car by using a single air-bag crash sensor instead of the usual three

to five.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#58:1> Bumpers were molded in color, making them recycleable and cutting

painting costs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#59:1> By locating satellite stamping facilities next to the main Neon

assembly plant in Belvidere, Ill., Chrysler will reduce shipping costs and

scrap.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#60:1> Chrysler also is shelving the standard approach of supplying

different sales outlets with slightly different versions of the same car.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#61:1> Because research showed consumers see through such tactics, both

Dodge and Plymouth dealers will sell identical Neons, saving on engineering,

advertising and other costs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#62:1> The Neons seek to offer the basics consumers expect in a small

car: a modest price and decent fuel mileage.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#63:1> Caddell said the car will get just below 30 mpg in the city and at

least 35 mpg on the highway.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#64:1> But Chrysler willingly sacrificed a bit of fuel economy to equip

the cars with a 2.0-liter, 16-valve engine--and make it more enjoyable to

drive.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#65:1> The car will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in about nine seconds.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#66:1> " It 's about the fastest car in the Chrysler Corp.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#67:1> short of the ( Dodge) Viper," Caddell said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#68:1> Dual air bags were included to address buyers' safety concerns.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#69:1> The car will meet federal safety standards for side-impact collisions

four years before they take effect.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#70:1> Enhancing the safety image is the availability of anti-lock brakes

and built-in child seats as options.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#71:1> " We're not 'reoking at making a profit by making the product

cheap," Caddell said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#72:1> " We're loo 'reg at making a profit by making the product

efficient."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#73:1> Will the Neon make money? As recently as January, retiree Iacocca

said he doubted it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#74:1> Analysts are more optimistic, but they think Chrysler will have to

sell at let 300,000 Neons a year to pet it into the black.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#75:1> That 's no easy task in a market as subdivided as America 's, and

it shows why European sales are necessary for the Neons to succeed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#76:1> " Volume is crucial," U-M 's Cole said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#77:1> " If for some reason the car doesn't sell...you've g 'vea serious

problem because your fixed costs are just about as high as with any

product."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#78:1> Four-door models will debut in the United States in January

followed by two-doors in September.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#79:1> Chrysler plans to begin exporting four-door versions to Europe--where

the subcompact market is about twice as large as the U.S. market for small

cars--in June.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#80:1> Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#81:1> in New York, said some Chrysler managers are worried they won't have

enough capacity in Illinois and at the plant in Mexico to satisfy demand.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#82:1> " They're 'reually scratching their heads: 'What if the Neon is more

successful than we think?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#83:1> For America 's small cars, it would be a switch.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#84:1> <h> CHRYSLER'S OVERSEAS GAMBLE </h> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#85:2> <h> Ford, UAW consider 4-day week for Wayne </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#86:2> Ford Motor Co.and the United Auto Workers are considering a

proposal to put the Wayne assembly plant on an unusual four-day work week--a

possible model for alternative schedules elsewhere.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#87:2> The plan under consideration in local negotiations calls for the

plant to run two ten-hour shifts a day for four days.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#88:2> Plant management and UAW Local 900 have formed a committee to study

the idea, a union source said Wednesday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#89:2> The proposed schedule would help cut absenteeism, since workers

would enjoy three-day weekends.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#90:2> " We believe the new schedule will help attendance," the source said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#91:2> " We took a survey, and about 90 percent of our members wanted

it."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#92:2> It would boost Ford 's capacity at the Wayne plant, which now

builds Escort subcompacts.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#93:2> The company could easily schedule five or even six days of

production.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#94:2> The extra capacity could become important later if Ford decides to

move additional Escort production from Mexico.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#95:2> Utility expenses like heat and lighting would also fall if the

plant didn't need to operate on the fifth day.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#96:2> Unlike General Motors Corp.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#97:2> and Chrysler Corp., Ford has been reluctant to boost production by

using three work crews or three shifts at its assembly plants.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#98:2> Instead, Ford has relied on traditional overtime to get more vehicles

out of some plants.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#99:2> The four-day arrangement would not require Ford to hire a third

shift of workers, as General Motors did at its Saturn plant in Spring Hill,

Tenn., and its Lordstown, Ohio, Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird

assembly plant.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#100:2> The main roadblock to changing the Wayne plant 's schedule seems

to be overtime pay.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#101:2> Ford wants employees to work four ten-hour shifts at normal wage

rates.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#102:2> But the union wants workers to be paid overtime for the extra two

hours added to each daily shift.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#103:2> Union leaders believe the extra day off at the Wayne plant could

reduce unexcused absences from the plant 's current rate of 4 percent, which

is slightly above the average absentee rate at Big Three factories.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#104:2> Ford spokesman David Caplan declined to comment on the status of

the negotiations.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#105:2> However, Caplan did note that the company has not floated any formal

proposals for a new work week in local negotiations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#106:2> A UAW source noted that similar proposals have cropped up from

time to time in previous negotiations with Ford locals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-013#107:2> Each UAW local negotiates its own three-year contract with

company plant managers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#108:2> Local agreements typically handle issues such as work rules,

outsourcing, absenteeism and safety.
<ICE-USA:W2C-013#109:2> Their importance has grown as automakers are racing to make their

operations more efficient.</p> </I>
