<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#1:1> Efforts to fight sexual violence have a central place in the

history of feminist aspiration.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#2:1> But many of today 's activists want to do more than ensure justice and

sensitive treatment for victims.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#3:1> They want to restructur laws and institutions to reflect the view that

rape, far from being an individual crime, is a social disease afflicting most

men.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#4:1> With a guilt-tripped male Senate falling over itself to demonstrate

gender sensitivity, the activists have never had a better chance to codify

this new understanding of sexual violence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#5:1> And they've almost succeeded.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#6:1> An unlikely 'velition of activists and politicians have joined forces

to support the Violence Against Women Act of 1993, which would enhance

penalties for violent crimes " motivated by gender."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#7:1> The bill has been heralded by Senator Joseph Biden, its chief

sponsor, as " the first comprehensive approach to fighting all forms of

violence against women, combining a broad array of needed reforms."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#8:1> But its central reform--turning some rapes into " hate" crimes--is not

needed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#9:1> Its political base in an alliance between feminist absolutism and

patriarchal condescension is inherently unstable, and anathema to sound law.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#10:1> By elevating motive over deed, anti-rape activists threaten to

subvert their movement 's main premise: that rapes are crimes of violence;

that no rapes are " better" or " worse" than others.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#11:1> Biden, who has been lecturing on date rape since 1980, first

introduced the bill in 1990, warning his Senate colleagues that it would "

change attitudes" and " test our assumptions." Not surprisingly, it never

made it to the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#12:1> So to help promote his cause, Biden held four days of hearings,

featuring the wrenching testimony of rape survivors.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#13:1> He interviewed experts.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#14:1> His staff even ginned up a sixty-five-page report, " Response to

Rape: Detours on the Road to Equal Justice," which portrays the problem as

worse than we ever supposed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#15:1> This year, thanks to Biden 's persistence and the fact that

feminism is a hot commodity in Washington, the bill is expected to sail

through the Senate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#16:1> " There was a strong message sent in the last election that women and

women 's issues were not being addressed in Congress," says Democratic Senator

Patty Murray.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#17:1> " That helps passage of bills like this." On May 27 the Senate

Judiciary Committee approved the bill unanimously.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#18:1> It is expected to go to the floor sometime in the next few months,

buoyed by a bipartisan list of sixty-two co-sponsors.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#19:1> " I predict the Senate will pass it unanimously," says Democrat

Charles Robb.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#20:1> But should it?
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#21:1> Certainly the bill is not without merit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#22:1> VAWA would, for example, establish new rules of evidence, limiting

the use of a victim 's clothing or sexual history in rape trials.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#23:1> It would also finance increased lighting and camera surveillance at

bus stops and in parks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#24:1> The heart of the bill, however, is its civil rights provision, which

attempts to create a federal remedy for violent crimes committed on the basis

of " an animus based on the victim 's gender."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#25:1> Title 3, called " Civil Rights for Women," would make sexual violence

a violation of federal civil rights law.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#26:1> " This is the beginning, middle and end of the legislation," says

Biden.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#27:1> In reclassifying rape, wife-beating and other gender-based felonies

as bias crimes, the provision would write into law the view of rape as a

socially embedded institution.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#28:1> " Rape as an expression of male dominance has been tolerated because

of our society 's sexist attitudes," says Sally Goldfarb of the National

Organization for Women 's Legal Defense Fund.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#29:1> " One of the advantages of the bill is that it codifies the true

nature of rape."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#30:1> Rape is a horrible crime, whether kindled by sexism or sheer

nastiness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#31:1> But rather than creating new penalties for bigoted thoughts and bad

motives, why not put in place the relatively straightforward remedy of

stiffening jail sentences for rapists?
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#32:1> Part of the problem, says Biden, was Democratic coalition politics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#33:1> At first, women 's groups opposed his effort.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#34:1> " Most of these people are way left," he explains.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#35:1> " We wanted to increase jail terms and they said, 'Hey, that 's aimed

at black males.'"
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#36:1> When he took out the stiffer-sentencing provisions, the women 's

groups jumped on board.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#37:1> Biden sees rape as an almost normative condition of female

experience.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#38:1> " It 's not just garbage cans and alleys," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#39:1> " It 's people with standing in the community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#40:1> It 's everywhere."<ICE-USA:W2B-016#> Feminist author Andrea Dworkin, who consulted

with Biden 's staff on the bill, takes this a step further.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#41:1> " When Joe Biden or other men think about this, they're always acts

they would not 'remit, " she says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#42:1> " They're always thinking about it in wa 'rethat exclude them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#43:1> Whereas we're thinking, they're included."<I 'reUSA:W2B-016#> C 'reidering this world

view, it 's no wonder the stiffened-sentences provision was tamped, down to "

a sentencing commission to review offenses."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#44:1> The idea of harsh penalties would undermine the bill 's ideological

coherence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#45:1> If rape is less a crime than a social pattern in which all men are

implicated, the cultural rationale for punishing those responsible

disappears.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#46:1> Meanwhile, says Biden, " Women are being victimized more and

more.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#47:1> And society 's doing less and less about it."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#48:1> Never mind Bureau of Justice Statistics that show the incidents of

rape per 1,000 women declined 30 percent between 1980 and 1990.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#49:1> For Biden the problem is not so much empirical as philosophical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#50:1> " I have become convinced," he writes in the bill 's preamble, " that

violence against women reflects as much a failure of our nation 's collective

moral imagination as it does the failure of our nation 's laws and

regulations."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#51:1> Biden will need considerable imagination to enforce the bill 's

civil rights provision.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#52:1> While there are rapists who hate women and use the act as a way of

expressing their hostility, they are in the minority.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#53:1> According to Richard Felson, a sociologist at SUNY-Albany who has

studied motives for sexual coercion, rape has never been successfully

correlated with hostility toward women.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#54:1> " Men who commit rape don't have any special attitude toward women,'

he says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#55:1> " They're versatile.
<ICE-USA:W2 're16#56:1> They tend to commit other crimes, to mistreat people generally."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#57:1> Civil libertarians, meanwhile, are troubled by the bill 's

explicit " animus" standard, which seems to permit an inquiry into bigoted

thoughts and motives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#58:1> " There 's a big difference between criminal and civil cases for these

purposes," notes Andrew Good, a Boston civil defense lawyer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#59:1> " With a civil case, you face the prospect of a very intrusive

investigation of your views.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#60:1> It 's, 'Are you or have you ever been a sexist?'
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#61:1> This is one of those well-intentioned, god-awful pieces of

legislation whose consequences only become apparent when it 's too late to get

repealed."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#62:1> Nevertheless, some in the Senate are not too worried.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#63:1> " I'm willing to err on the side 'me bill comes down on," says' Robb.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#64:1> " If it doesn't pass constitutional muster, so be it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#65:1> I'd rather send a messa 'd at this point."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#66:1> Meanwhile, differences over the scope of the civil rights

provision threaten to create rifts in the coalition.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#67:1> To the social constructionists, gender hatred is disclosed in the act

of rape itself.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#68:1> " Theoretically, I guess, a rape could take place that was not driven

by gender animus," muses Biden.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#69:1> " But I can't think of what it would be." Senator Orrin Hatch, the

bill 's primary co-sponsor, sees things a little differently.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#70:1> " You can make distinctions," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#71:1> " We're not opening the f 'reral doors to all gender-motivated crimes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#72:1> Say you have a man who believes a woman is attractive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#73:1> He feels encouraged by her and he 's so motivated by that

encouragement that he rips her clothes off and has sex with her against her

will.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#74:1> Now let 's say you have another man who grabs a woman off some lonely

road and in the process of raping her says words like, 'You're wearing a

sk 're!
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#75:1> You're a woman!
<ICE- 're:W2B-016#76:1> I hate women!
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#77:1> I'm going to show you, y 'm woman!'
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#78:1> Now, the first one 's terrible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#79:1> But the other 's much worse.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#80:1> If a man rapes a woman while telling her he loves her, that 's a far

cry from saying he hates her.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#81:1> A lust factor does not spring from animus."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#82:1> Senator Denni DeConcini, another co-sponsor, agrees with Hatch 's

interpretation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#83:1> " With the first example, you have only one major violation," he

says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#84:1> " But with the second example, you have two!
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#85:1> What you've got there is 'veo crimes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#86:1> They're subject to 'rearate determination."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#87:1> Apparently, hating women in general is worse than hating one in

particular.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#88:1> Feminists who worked with the Judiciary Committee in drafting the

bill are dismayed at these fumbling legalisms.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#89:1> " That 's ridiculous," says Eleanor Smeal of the Fund for a Feminist

Majority.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#90:1> " Rape is never an act of lust.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#91:1> Mr. Hatch just doesn't get it." NOW 's Goldfarb agrees.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#92:1> Obviously, Hatch and DeConcini will have to be led around by the

hand.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#93:1> Their befuddlement, however, points up a larger problem.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#94:1> By asking politicians and juries to make difficult distinctions

between " terrible" and " much worse" rapes, the gender feminists are in

danger of reifying the very value judgments the date-rape movement sought to

eviscerate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#95:1> " There 's always that risk," says Dworkin.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#96:1> " That 's part of the ongoing struggle and conflict."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#97:1> Meanwhile, Dworkin claims to be surprised at the bill 's

popularity in the Senate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#98:1> " The only possible explanation for it is that senators don't

understand the meaning of the legislation they pass," she says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#99:1> " I expect that the more they understand, the narrower the margin of

support will be."
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#100:1> She may be right.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#101:1> Most of the bill 's co-sponsors seem to view the legislation as

merely the latest stop on the road of Anita Hill penance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#102:1> " Men need to be educated as to what others find offensive," says

DeConcini.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#103:1> " They might think it 's O.K.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#104:1> to rub somebody 's behind.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#105:1> But they need to learn that hey, unless you know that person well

enough and you've tal 've about it, it 's not O.K.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#106:1> That 's what this is all about." Bob Packwood, Daniel Inouye and Ted

Kennedy apparently agree.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#107:1> They've s 'veed on as co-sponsors too.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#108:2> <h> Can Aristide come home now?<h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#109:2> <h> LOVE AND HAITI </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#110:2> Under Bill Clinton as well as George Bush, U.S. policy in Haiti

has threatened without delivering.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#111:2> The Haitian generals, masters of bluff and bravado themselves, see

this for what it is.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#112:2> Their interpretation: the United States <it> says </it> it wants to

reinstate democratic rule, but it doesn't--not really.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#113:2> In the past few weeks, however, the intransigence of the Haitian

military has been so embarrassing to the United States that the

administration has been forced to make good on a few of its threats.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#114:2> Two weeks ago, responding to the Haitian generals' retreat from

the negotiating table, the United States finally revoked the visas and froze

the assets of some of the leaders and backers of the 1991 coup against Jean

Bertrand Aristide.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#115:2> Of course, since the Americans had threatened to do this for almost

two years, there was not much left to freeze.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#116:2> The United States also agreed to support forthcoming U.N.-enforced

petroleum and weapons sanctions against Haiti, after having closed its eyes

to the leakiness of the OAS-Sponsored trade embargo that is theoretically

still in effect.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#117:2> Clinton put Marc Bazin, prime minister of the de facto regime, on

his assets list, sending a signal that Bazin is no longer the Americans' pet

pol.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#118:2> Once he lost his U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#119:2> support, Bazin also lost his military backing and was forced to

resign.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#120:2> Now that Haiti has no de facto president or prime Minister, the

regime is openly military.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#121:2> Old institutional ties within Haiti are a big reason it took the

United States so long to get serious.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#122:2> Since its nineteen-year occupation of Haiti, which began in 1915,

the United States has had close links to Haiti 's light-skinned elite, whom

the Marine occupiers found more appealing than the country 's blacker, poorer

citizens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#123:2> The occupation government ran customs, where its agents and officers

worked with the elite business families of the <it> bord de mer </it> , which

supervised exports.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#124:2> The Marines installed a succession of mulatto puppet presidents and

developed a mulatto officer corps for what became the modern Haitian army.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#125:2> The military relationship remains strong.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#126:2> Generals Henry Namphy and Prosper Avril, two of Haiti 's

post-Duvalier dictators, were trained in the United States, as were Raoul

Cedras, chief of staff under Aristide and leader of the coup against him, and

Michel Francois, perhaps the most brutal of the anti-Aristide officers

running the country.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#127:2> In other words, the generals who led the coup against Aristide,

and their business backers, had good reason to expect the United States not

to push them too hard for Aristide 's return.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#128:2> They knew the U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#129:2> Embassy and the U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#130:2> Agency for International Development in Haiti harbored a deep

antipathy to Aristide, whom the embassy had labeled " a radical firebrand"

before he became a presidential candidate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#131:2> Aristide was just the kind of leader--poor, country-bred, black--the

Marines had fought in various anti-U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#132:2> rebellions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#133:2> He had no ties to the elite.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#134:2> He was out of the Port-au-Prince loop, and to be feared.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-016#135:2> AID, on the other hand, was very much on the inside with

Port-au-Prince society.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#136:2> The secretaries at the fancy AID office came from Haiti 's best

families.
<ICE-USA:W2B-016#137:2> The embassy nurse, an American, was married to the scion of a

wealthy elite clan, a man who participated in an abortive coup against

Aristide even before the new president was inaugurated.</p> </I>
