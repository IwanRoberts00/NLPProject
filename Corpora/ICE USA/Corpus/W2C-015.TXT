<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#1:1> Next weekend in Florence, you can visit an adobe home built by

Jesus Martinez in the 1870s and see the original saguaro-rib ceiling

supported by crooked cottonwoods harvested at the Gila River.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#2:1> Next month in Globe, you can tour one of the town 's earliest

schools that sits on a hill overlooking the Old Dominion Mine, soon to open

as a bed-and-breakfast.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#3:1> You also can tour the mine.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#4:1> In Tubac, Arizona 's oldest non-Indian community, you can walk

through history, from the 1750s to the late 1880s, starting with a look at an

archaeological dig.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#5:1> In Willcox, there 's the oldest department store in the state.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#6:1> All across Arizona, communities large and small use building tours

to show off their history, lifestyle and the hard work of people who cherish

their homes.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#7:1> What better way to taste the true flavor of a town than to visit

private dwellings and special buildings? " It 's been such a neat thing," said

Sheldon Miller, manager of the Globe-Miami Chamber of Commerce.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#8:1> Its annual tour has grown in the past three years to draw a couple of

thousand visitors.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#9:1> The event has become a sort of community festival, with an associated

antiques show, community theater performances and an exhibit of local

quilting art.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#10:1> " We found out things about ourselves that we were unaware of,

that people enjoy our historic structures and homes that we took for

granted," Miller said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#11:1> " People coming from the outside were probably much more appreciative

of our history than we as citizens were.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#12:1> " We know of instances where people have come on the tour, been

impressed with the community, and have come back to explore us a little

more."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#13:1> <h> Catalysts for volunteers </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#14:1> The tours can be massive community catalysts, said Susan Spater,

director of the Pimeria Alta Historical Society Museum in Nogales, because so

many volunteers are needed to coordinate the event, sell tickets and serve as

guides in the homes and buildings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#15:1> In Globe, students are recruited from high schools and 4-H Clubs

to serve as greeters and door openers, Miller said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#16:1> The tours, which have more than 100 people working daily, also are

painless teaching tools.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#17:1> " It helps us with understanding the continuity of history a

little better," Spater said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#18:1> The Nogales tour typically includes several turn-of-the-century

homes, Queen Anne Victorians and Sonoran-style adobes, the hidden treasures

of Nogales that still are lived in by fifth-generation families.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#19:1> Nogales has more examples of domestic historic architecture from the

turn of the century than any other town in the state, Spater said, and the

historic tour highlights this resource.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#20:1> The tour also includes a contemporary home, she said, to

illustrate that history extends into our time.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#21:1> The home of noted Arizona architect Bennie Gonzales, for example, has

been on the tour.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#22:1> <h> Jerome high on list </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#23:1> Aficionados of home tours could make an argument that Jerome 's is

Arizona 's most popular tour.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#24:1> Jerome also has been opening its homes to the public longer than

anyone else: The 1993 tour will be its 28th.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#25:1> Jerome homes can even be viewed as works in progress.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#26:1> " We get people who come back year after year after year," said

Christine Warren, tour coordinator.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#27:1> " We always try to do something different.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#28:1> We try not to show ( the same home) within five years.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#29:1> If it 's under construction, we'll show a home, then show 'll again

five years later.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#30:1> " Just two years ago, we had a friend 's house just up the hill

from me.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#31:1> I said, 'Leave everything the way it is.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#32:1> Don't worry about cleaning up the sawdust and putting tools away.' So

he just cordoned it off so people could move through it easily, and people

loved it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#33:1> It was one of the most popular stops on the tour.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#34:1> Hopefully, in five years, we'll be able to talk him i 'll it again and

show the progress."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#35:1> <h> Miners of major interest </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#36:1> Mining communities, including Jerome, Bisbee, Globe-Miami and

Ajo, typically include both modest miners' houses restored in creative ways

as well as larger homes built for or by the mine managers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#37:1> Once you've walked on stepping ston 'vedown an otherwise inaccessible

" street" in Jerome, to a home where all groceries are transported in a

child 's red wagon, you have a better grasp of the challenges and delights of

living there.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#38:1> Bisbee, called Queen of the Mining Towns in its heyday, could

today be called Queen of the Home Tour Towns.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#39:1> In addition to its 10-year-old fall home tour, another popular

bed-and-breakfast tour is held in June.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#40:1> This one focuses on the adaptive reuse of miners' boarding houses,

defunct schools and large homes originally built for mining executives.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#41:1> Last year, Bisbee added another home tour, this one of artists'

homes and studios, in March.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#42:1> " It really went over well," said Pat Hernandez of the Bisbee

Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#43:1> <h> New look at old homes </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#44:1> Older desert towns play up their adobe heritage, showing off

original details and years of hard work by homeowners.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#45:1> Florence, which has more than 130 buildings on the National Historic

Register, is a virtual catalog of Territorial adobe construction, starting

with Sonoran-style row houses punctuated by one doorway after another.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#46:1> Last year, Tubac started a one-day historic walk.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#47:1> Almost all of the buildings in the old part of town are adobe.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#48:1> The old Presidio, or fort, is where the tour starts, and visitors can

go down into an archaeological dig to see the foundations of the original

structure, built in 1752.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#49:1> The local Historical Society already had offered a brochure for a

self-guided tour.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#50:1> However, said assistant manager Richard Williams at the Tubac

Presidio, " we decided that in order to spread the word and generate more

interest in the historical nature of what we have here, we should one day a

year make it more similar to the Florence effort.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#51:1> Not all home tours reach so far back into time.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#52:1> <h> History is relative </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#53:1> A tour was held of the " historic" first homes in Green Valley, a

26-year-old retirement community south of Tucson.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#54:1> According to sponsors, the tour was a major hit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#55:1> " People love these things," Spater said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#56:1> " From our point of view, it 's such a seductive way to communicate

history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#57:1> " People absorb tremendous amounts of history doing something

that 's very fun.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#58:1> It 's a wonderful educational project for us.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#59:1> You don't have to dress up or go to a lecture hall, just show up for

something that 's really fun."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#60:1> Some tours are fund-raisers that focus on well-appointed homes

that may or may not have historic status.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#61:1> Often, these fund-raisers are held during the holidays.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#62:1> Last year, the Pinetop-Lakeside Cup of Cheer Christmas Home Tour

offered refreshments, five homes and an antiques store.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#63:1> One house was a large log cabin; another was a mobile home.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#64:1> " And a couple were traditional homes," a spokeswoman said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#65:1> " There are so many mobiles up here...
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#66:1> The idea is to get decoration ideas.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#67:1> And I think women just like to look at houses."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#68:1> 1) The second Pinal County Courthouse, 102 years old, is one of

the most recognized buildings in the town and always is on the annual tour of

historic buildings in Florence.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#69:1> The first courthouse, now McFarland State Park, also is on the

tour.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#70:1> 2) It 's always 9 o'clock - - or is it 11:45? - on the cupola of

the second Pinal County Courthouse.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#71:1> The clock faces and curtains are painted.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#72:1> 3) The Florence Woman 's Club building is on this year 's community

historic tour.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#73:1> Woman 's Clubs sponsor some of the many home tours held across the

state.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#74:1> A fireplace inside the club is large enough to accommodate standing

adults.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-015#75:2> <h> NFL FILMS FOUNDER'S SUPER STREAK IN JEOPARDY</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#76:2> <h> NFL Films founder and part-time Scottsdale resident Ed Sabol 's

Super Bowl streak is in jeopardy.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#77:2> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#78:2> Cue the dramatic music.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#79:2> For each of the preceding 26 NFL championship games, Sabol has

been there.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#80:2> Roll the slow-motion footage of Sabol intermixed with images of Super

Bowls past: Vince Lombardi on the sidelines.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#81:2> A victorious Joe Namath running off the field.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#82:2> But this year, Sabol is thinking about sitting out the big

game.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#83:2> Cut to an extreme close-up of Sabol 's eyes that portrays his

indecision.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#84:2> A golden-throated narrator explains the significance of THE STREAK in

battlefield metaphors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#85:2> Ed Sabol, 76, has been more than an idle spectator at each and

every Super Bowl.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#86:2> His NFL Films has been a catalytic force that helped make the NFL a

national obsession, and has elevated the Super Bowl from a mere game into a

de facto national holiday, a two-week-long event filled with endless hype and

prognostication.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#87:2> " We brought the game into the American living room," Sabol said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#88:2> " It sounds like a simple thing, but I think we've had a huge i 'vect

on the game of football."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#89:2> NFL Films has changed the image of professional football through

innovations that now seem inseparable from the game: Closely cropped shots in

ultra-slow motion.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#90:2> Reverse angle.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#91:2> Extreme close-ups of a player 's eyes or the sweat dripping from a

lineman 's facemask.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#92:2> Candid shots from the sidelines that show victory or defeat as

clearly as the action on the field.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#93:2> The imagery and drama that NFL Films has brought to the game has

not been by accident.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#94:2> NFL Films was formed in 1964 by the NFL owners with the expressed

purpose of providing some gloss to the sport 's blue-collar image.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#95:2> The company 's roots actually go back a few years further to 1962,

when Sabol, now president of the firm, bought the film rights to the NFL

Championship game.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#96:2> Sabol hired free-lance photographers, one of whom shot entirely in

slow motion.<ICE-USA:W2C-015#>"I knew the people who shot the championship the year before,"

Sabol said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#97:2> " They only shot in slow motion on third down.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#98:2> They said it was too expensive, because it uses so much film.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#99:2> I wanted to do something different, to make it more interesting, so I

shot the whole thing in slow motion.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#100:2> And then he hired Philadelphia television anchorman John Facenda to

do the voice-over.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#101:2> " He had a voice that could make a roll of toilet paper sound like

the U.S. Constitution," Sabol said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#102:2> The resulting film, Pro Football 's Longest Day, caught the eye of

then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#103:2> Sabol persuaded the owners to purchase his fledgling company and

make it into a promotional and film-marketing vehicle. Under the agreement,

which Rozelle and the owners accepted, each of the 14 NFL team owners chipped

in a one-time start-up fee of

&dollar;20,000.</p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#104:2> <h> Started with 3 employees</h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#105:2> With three initial employees, including Sabol 's son, Steve, NFL

Films' first responsibilities were limited to producing an NFL Championship

game film and an annual highlights film for each team.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#106:2> Later, when the American Football League merged with the NFL in

1967, the company 's responsibilities expanded to include filming AFL teams

and the Super Bowl.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#107:2> Under Steve Sabol, who has taken over as president and creative

director, NFL Films' signature style jelled.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#108:2> The senior Sabol gets credit for the emphasis on slow-motion and for

introducing the dramatic narration.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#109:2> But it was the younger Sabol who brought in many of the other

innovations.<ICE-USA:W2C-015#> " We've worke 'ves a team," Steve Sabol said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#110:2> " He was the salesman and the businessman.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#111:2> I was the film maker.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#112:2> This year, the company 's photographers will shoot about 650 miles of

film.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#113:2> The Sabols have resisted suggestions that they switch over to

less-expensive video.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#114:2> Steve Sabol likens film to the rich and varied grains a craftsman

brings out in wood.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#115:2> Video is more like Formica, he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#116:2> The company 's celluloid purchases make it Eastman Kodak 's largest

customer, he said.

<P> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#117:2> " We wouldn't be NFL Films without film," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#118:2> " Film is an essential part of the distinctive feel and mystique of

our productions.
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#119:2> We're 're journalists; we're 'rerytellers, romantics,

philosophers."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-015#120:2> <h> World 's largest collection</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-015#121:2> The company 's voracious consumption of film, combined with an

aggressive campaign to buy up early footage, has led to the world 's largest

collection of film from any professional sport.<ICE-USA:W2C-015#> The vault at the company 's

Mount Laurel, N.J., headquarters contains every print of every professional

football game since 1948, every print of championship games since the early '

30s, and selected prints dating even further back.</p></I>
