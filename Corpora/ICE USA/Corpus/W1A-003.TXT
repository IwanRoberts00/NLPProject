<ICE-USA:W1A-003#1:1> <h> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#2:1> This report analyzes UMD 's peer tutoring center tutor training

program and presents an alternative solution for improved tutor training.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#3:1> <h> The Present Training System is Outdated</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#4:1> The present tutor training system has been in effect from the

inception of the tutoring center over six years ago.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#5:1> The training program has been a success and has helped many students

through the tutoring experience, but has also gotten old and needs to grow

with the tutoring center.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#6:1> Some tutors are not getting the continuing education they desire

as they become more experienced and want to go further in their educational

abilities.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#7:1> The present system allows them only one quarter of classroom

experience to absorb this information.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#8:1> Tutors are also not getting enough praise for the work they do and

would appreciate some benefit for their volunteer time and effort.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#9:1> Lastly, tutors a program to keep them in closer contact with the

faculty of their educational discipline in order to remain up to date on the

status of the classes and teaching techniques.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#10:1> <h> The CRLA Program is an Effective Remedy</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#11:1> The College Reading and Learning Association 's accreditation

process remedies two of these three problems.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#12:1> First of all, it offers tutors the chance to complete three

single-quarter classes instead of just one.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#13:1> The extra classes give tutors the opportunity to expand their

knowledge and experience following a guideline for national accreditation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#14:1> The accreditation also gives tutors recognition for their work, which

is an added incentive to participate and excell.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#15:1> <h> INTRODUCTION</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#16:1> With the continued growth and success of the peer tutoring center

at UMD, it is ever more important to focus on one skills of its peer tutors

and on the training they receive.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#17:1> This paper examines the implementation of a program to nationally

certify tutors through an expanded training program.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#18:1> This program would benefit both tutors and the students they work

with if it were shown to be effective and convenient enough for all involved.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#19:1> Strengths and weaknesses of the present tutor training program and

the proposed certification program will be presented, along with a

recommendation for the most feasible alternative.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#20:1> <h> BACKGROUND</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#21:1> The peer tutoring center at UMD was set up just six years ago and

has continued to follow the same general principals throughout its history.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#22:1> It is a true success story in that there were no other models

available at the time on which to base this type of learning center.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#23:1> The tutoring center is original because of its integration into the

academic fabric of the school, and also because of its continued growth over

the years.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#24:1> From fall of 1987 to present, the number of tutorials has grown from

816 to approximately 4000 per quarter.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#25:1> In addition, many other universities are now using the tutoring

program here as a model to base their own.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#26:1> The faculty involved in the program have given many national

presentations to other interested campuses around the United States (

Treuer)</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#27:1> <h> PROBLEM DEFINITION</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#28:1> As the number of tutor and tutorials have grown over the years,

so has the need for improved training.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#29:1> The training program that was developed six years ago with ~he

introduction of UMD 's tutoring center was completely original and has for the

most part served its purpose well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#30:1> With the introduction of additional tutoring disciplines and

increased expectations of students, a more specialized and structured program

has become necessary.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#31:1> Some tutors have voiced the opinion that they are not given the

opportunity to develop their skills fully and would like the opportunity for

increased instruction in the art of peer tutoring ( Treuer) .
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#32:1> The training system in place now gives tutors the opportunity to

participate in only one full quarter training practicum.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#33:1> This class covers the basics of teaching, learning styles, and

sensitivity training but leaves much to be desired for many tutors who want

the chance to further develop their skills.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#34:1> Other tutors complain that they are not given enough recognition

for the hard work and thoughtful assistance they provide for their peers.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#35:1> Since the tutoring at UMD is done on a strictly voluntary basis, it

is important to keep the tutors relatively satisfied.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#36:1> If too many tutors come to the conclusion that they are not getting

any benefit for their effort ( material or immaterial) there may be a problem

with recruiting enough tutors to supply the current demand.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#37:1> <h> PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#38:1> The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current method of

training tutors in the UMD Achievement Center and determine if this status

quo should be changed by implementing the College Reading and Learning

Association 's program for national certification.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#39:1> An analysis into both the program 's positive and negative points will

be included as well as a recommendation for the best alternative at this

time.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#40:1> <h> METHODOLOGY AND ORGANIZATION</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#41:1> In order to become familiar with the College Reading and Learning

Association 's ( CRLA) program for certifying tutor training programs, I

consulted UMD Achievement Center staff member Paul Treuer.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#42:1> I used the outline for CRLA certification to develop a questionnaire

( Appendix A) to distribute to present tutors to get their opinion on this

proposed change both good and bad.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#43:1> I have acquired knowledge of the present system of tutor training

first-hand by going through the tutor training course in winter of 1993.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#44:1> Since then, I have been a business and economics tutor and have had

the chance to experience both the joys and the frustrations of peer tutoring.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#45:1> I have also spent past two quarters working at the reception desk in

the tutoring center doing such tasks as keeping track of the number of

tutorials and providing information to new tutors.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#46:1> This experience has allowed me to identify both strengths and

weaknesses of the present system.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#47:1> Finally, I used secondary library research to see what other

learning centers find important when training new tutors and how they go

about developing their skills with the greatest success and the least

resistance on the tutor 's part.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#48:1> <h> WHY TUTOR TRAINING IS IMPORTANT </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#49:1> In order to determine which method of tutor training s most

beneficial, it is important to determine why tutor training is important to

the success of the overall tutoring program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#50:1> " Research suggests.. that the effectiveness of peer tutoring

depends primarily on the type of training the tutors receive" ( Deming 5).
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#51:1> Just because a student is successful in a classroom does not

automatically mean they are prepared to start teaching this material to

another student.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#52:1> A tutor must be prepared to begin the tutoring experience before any

successful interaction can take place.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#53:1> Classroom training of tutors should include many aspects including

the following.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#54:1> Tutors should become familiarized with the learning center system

in order to become comfortable in the new environment and to learn general

policies and procedures of the center.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#55:1> This should include a tour of the tutoring center along with a

description of all available reference materials.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#56:1> This is important to let the tutors know what they have to work with

and what they may want to ask for for future reference.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#57:1> The sign in or other attendance measures should also be described to

assure accurate bookkeeping of tutorials.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#58:1> Tutors must also learn to become sensitive to the varied needs

and abilities of others in the student body.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#59:1> They must learn to treat others equitably and fairly regardless of

learning level or background.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#60:1> Some important groups to focus on include nontraditional students,

racial minorities, and people with physical or mental disabilities.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#61:1> Learning techniques for dealing with others fairly assures that no

student seeking help is alienated.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#62:1> This keeps the tutoring center from being viewed in a negative

light.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#63:1> One of the most important skills a tutor can learn is how to ask

questions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#64:1> Learning what to ask, how to ask, and when to ask questions can make

the difference between a very successful and very unsuccessful tutor.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#65:1> Asking questions of the person seeking help allows that person to

think more about what their actual problem is.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#66:1> Questions can also be used to direct a student to the answer without

coming right out and saying it.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#67:1> This in turn teaches the student about the process of learning and

how to approach problems from a different angle.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#68:1> The tutor should also be asking him/herself questions constantly to

stay involved in the situation and to anticipate future plans of action.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#69:1> Some questions tutors should ask themselves include ( Deming 6)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#70:1> What do I think the tutee is sensing?
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#71:1> What do I think the tutee is feeling?
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#72:1> What do I think the tutee is thinking?
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#73:1> Why do I think the tutee is here?
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#74:1> What are his/her expectations?
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#75:1> What is the tutee doing? - What are the tutee~ actions? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#76:1> By learning to ask these questions, a tutor becomes more prepared

to handle different and varied situations in the tutoring process.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#77:1> Hardly any two tutorials are the same, and it is therefore very

important for tutors to be trained to handle different situations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#78:1> Tutors must also have access to a structured environment where

they can continue to practice and expand their skills.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#79:1> This environment should include contact with the professors of their

chosen tutoring field to provide links between learning mediums and to make

sure that they are not working against each other.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#80:1> Contact with professors also keeps tutors up to date on changes that

may have been made in certain classes over time.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#81:1> <h> NEEDS OF A SUCCESSFUL TUTOR TRAINING PROGRAM</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#82:1> From the above paragraphs it becomes clear that there are many

criteria necessary for a successful tutor training program.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#83:1> Tutors must become familiar with tutoring environment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#84:1> Tutors must become sensitive to varied needs of students.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#85:1> Tutors must learn questioning skills.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#86:1> Tutors must have continued contact with faculty and

administration.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#87:1> <h> DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT SITUATION</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#88:1> The tutoring center at UMD has applied basically the same tutor

training program from its inception and has worked satisfactorily for the

past six years.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#89:1> The tutor training course ( SSP 3003) is a ten week classroom

experience instructed by Paul Treuer and Kathy Clark.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#90:1> The class lasts for two hours and is held one day a week in the

Achievement Center at UMD.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#91:1> This course is basically an introduction to one-on-one and small

group tutoring, yet includes training in other areas.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#92:1> The general week-by-week schedule outline is as follows (

Credit-Based Peer Tutoring, 21):</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#93:1> Week 1: What can I expect in the Tutoring Center?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#94:1> Week 2: What do I really know about my discipline and how did I

learn it?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#95:1> Week 3: What values and ethics will be important to me as I

tutor?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#96:1> Week 4: How can I help someone who is struggling?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#97:1> Week 5: How can I communicate effectively?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#98:1> Week 6: What are some effective strategies for one-on-one

tutoring?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#99:1> Week 7: What tutoring strategies work with small groups?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#100:1> Week 8: How might my tutee 's learning style differ from my

own?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#101:1> Week 9: How can I create a comfortable and equitable learning

environment?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#102:1> Week 10: Case studies: This is what I 've learned!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#103:1> In addition to covering these topics during the quarter, tutors

also spend three hours a week in the tutoring center working with other

students.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#104:1> This gives them the opportunity to apply their knowledge right from

the first week and they can come back to the next classroom discussion with

problems or successes to talk about.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#105:1> Tutors are also required to keep a journal during the quarter

which helps to solidify their experiences and frustrations as they encounter

different situations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#106:1> This journal is the used as a source for a tutoring portfolio, which

is a compilation of most of the tutors activities during the quarter

including: statement of tutoring philosophy, tutoring responsibilities,

personal tutoring assessment along with ideas for improving effectiveness,

reflective statements, and a case study of a chosen individual with whom the

tutor has worked during the quarter.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#107:1> <h> PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-003#108:1> Although the current situation meets most of the criteria

necessary for an effective training program, there are still some which need

to be met.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#109:1> First of all, this program is limited in its time frame.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#110:1> One quarter is often times not long enough to learn all of the

skills necessary to become a good tutor.
<ICE-USA:W1A-003#111:1> While some tutors are happy to have their training complete in one

quarter, others express that they would like to have extended training to

work on their skills while learning new ones.
