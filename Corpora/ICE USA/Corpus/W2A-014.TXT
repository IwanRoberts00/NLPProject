<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#1:1> <it> The circuits of capital/uneven development model is widely

used in geography, urban planning, and the social sciences.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#2:1> Its principal weakness is its marginalizing of local influences in

explaining the intensity and patterning of metropolitan investment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#3:1> A deeper consideration of local culture, politics, and biographies is

needed to sensitize the model to the particularities of place.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#4:1> Local creative actors set in motion place-specific forms of change

whose logic is tied to structured circumstances. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#5:1> Studies of North American urban structure increasingly incorporate

the insights of neostructuralist theory to dissect gentrification, slum

formation, downtown restructuring, and similar urban processes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#6:1> Whereas ecological and neoclassical studies cast districts as

essentially outgrowths of metropolitan forces, neostructuralist studies

emphasize the influence of regional, national, and global economic processes

( Smith and Feagin 1987; Cater and Jones 1989).
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#7:1> They seek to connect broad economic transformation with local urban

change, recognizing that human agents and large-scale processes restructure

places.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#8:1> Local agents are frequently seen as translators of broad processes,

who transmit the influence of structures to neighborhood or city. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#9:1> The circuits of capital/uneven development model emphasizes the

local transformative influence of a crisis-driven national economy ( Harvey

1981, 1982).
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#10:1> It connects local urban change with the capital accumulation process.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#11:1> In this model, investment shifting across economic circuits together

with the logic of local uneven development explain the intensity and

distribution of local restructuring.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#12:1> Investment shifting across economic circuits involves three

interrelated capital outlets: the primary(investment in production),

secondary ( investment in built environment and consumption fund), and

tertiary ( investment in technology and labor power reproduction).
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#13:1> Investment shifts initially concentrate in production.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#14:1> A tendency to channel too much investment into primary production

arises as investors act in a way that, in aggregate, runs counter to their

own class interest.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#15:1> Bouts of overaccumulating capital ( and underinvestment in the built

environment) then facilitate capital shifting to the secondary circuit.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#16:1> Investors subsequently generate crisis in this circuit by

concentrating capital in the built environment that overaccumulates and

produces falling profits.This crisis is evinced by periods of excess

residential and commercial construction, rising building vacancies, and

declining real estate prices.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#17:1> Investment again needs to be withdrawn, this time out of the built

environment, and guided elsewhere to elude declining profits.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#18:1> Such investment switching is chronic and permits investors to stay

one step ahead of falling profits. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#19:1> The second part of the circuits of capital model, the logic of

local uneven development, explains investment patterns by reference to

differential opportunities for capturing potential profit from redevelopment

across space.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#20:1> Investment accumulates where potential property value is not captured

under present use, usually where substandard buildings and property

predominate.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#21:1> Areas are seen to undergo progressive disinvestment that creates a

gap between potential and actual land rent being extracted.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#22:1> When this gap is most pronounced, investment flows back to the area

to close the rent gap.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#23:1> Devaluation therefore sets the stage for profitable investment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#24:1> Metropolitan change becomes spatially uneven, profit-driven and

pronounced in areas where property value potential is currently unfulfilled.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#25:1> I examine the current status of the circuits of capital/uneven

development model in light of its increased use in geography, urban planning,

and the social sciences ( see Jackson 1984; Leitner 1987).
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#26:1> I identify its weaknesses and propose a revised formulation for more

sophisticated usage.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#27:1> My goal is to offer a model that is more sensitive to the particular

circumstances of specific places.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#28:1> Empirical applications of this model subsume the importance of the

local to the general and exhibit two major flaws.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#29:1> First, they marginalize the role of locally constructed investment

incentives as forces attracting capital.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#30:1> Overemphasis on the built environment as a safety valve for

investment conceals the influence of constructed investment incentives.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#31:1> Second, they neglect the role of local culture, politics, and

individuals in structuring uneven development.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#32:1> The model casts the process as something that happens to people

rather than something they influence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#33:1> The filter of local process, I believe, ceaselessly meshes with

broader economic processes to generate uneven investment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#34:1> My proposal for refining this model calls for a deeper

consideration of local culture, politics, and actors in explaining the

intensity and patterning of metropolitan investment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#35:1> The granting of significant causal power to the rich texture of place

adds breadth to the model.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#36:1> This element is important with recognition that intensities and

patterns of restructuring vary widely across metropolitan areas.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#37:1> My revision retains the historical-materialist character of the model

while sharpening its grasp of local conditions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#38:1> Culture, politics, and individuals should be crucial components in

any materialist model that purports to explain local restructuring. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#39:1> <h> <bold> Empirical Applications </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#40:1> Recent applications of the circuits of capital model are

suggestive but they frequently lack detail and specificity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#41:1> Four studies have attracted disproportionate attention amidst a surge

of applications ( see Clark 1988; Badcock 1989; Beauregard 1991).
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#42:1> Harvey 's ( 1981) historical analysis of US urbanism, the first

application of this model, linked recent urban growth to national and

international economic processes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#43:1> Harvey cast the ebb and flow of real estate investment as outcomes of

overaccumulating capital in the primary circuit that necessitated capital

rechanneling.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#44:1> Too much capital initially was produced in the primary circuit in

aggregate for its profitable employment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#45:1> Capital switching, to Harvey, represented efforts to find productive

outlets for capital.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#46:1> The global economic crises of the 1930s and 1970s represented most

vivid illustrations of this switching.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#47:1> Uneven urban development that followed was theorized as a see-saw

investment pattern driven by the rhythms of capital accumulation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#48:1> Devaluation of fixed capital set the stage for renewed investment

that blunted falling rates of profit in production. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#49:1> Harvey ( 1985) expanded this argument in a more sophisticated

study of Paris, with its massive building programs under Louis Napolean and

Baron Haussrnann Economic crisis, once again, took the form of overproduction

that spurred massive construction in the 1850s and 1860s.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#50:1> Government and banks were used to resolve this crisis; intervention

eased capital switching from primary to secondary circuits.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#51:1> This intervention temporarily resolved one crisis only to generate

another.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#52:1> Deficit financing of new construction represented a new investment

outlet but created an overstretched financial structure doomed to crash. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#53:1> Harvey 's study of Paris traced how the large-scale and local

interconnected to produce unique local restructuring.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#54:1> Uneven investment across Paris was guided by active agents infused

with a materialist imperative.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#55:1> A logic of accumulation was negotiated by personal biographies that

ascribed meaning and symbolism to the restructuring process.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#56:1> A central figure in this process was Baron Haussman, who helped

construct a built environment that permitted excess capital to circulate and

be absorbed in the everyday fabric.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#57:1> He mobilized public works projects that transformed Paris to his

personalized specifications.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#58:1> Eased flows between center and periphery, left and right banks, and

industrial and commercial spaces opened up new investment opportunities and

renewed livability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#59:1> This restructuring had a unique and distinctive form whose logic was

compelled by circumstances of economic crisis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#60:1> The " force he [ Haussman] had to mobilize, and it was in the end the

force that mastered him, was the circulation of capital.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#61:1> The surpluses of capital and labor power absolutely had to be

absorbed if the Empire was to survive" ( Harvey 1985, 76). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#62:1> Following the lead of Harvey, Feagin ( 1985) examined office

building investment in Houston, Texas.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#63:1> Municipal mediation of investment flows across circuits constituted

Feagin 's focus.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#64:1> Municipal government catalyzed office construction through weak

investment regulation, technical assistance, and absence of zoning.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#65:1> At the same time, the city provided construction subsidies in the

form of tax abatements, reduced land prices, and block grants.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#66:1> The resulting boom in construction attracted jobs and capital

believed critical to economic viability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#67:1> Government rhetoric extolling the virtues of unfettered growth

accompanied these programs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#68:1> Such investment was not profitable forever, however.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#69:1> Unregulated investment generated periods of overbuilding, as shown in

cycles of rising vacancy rates and falling profits.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#70:1> Slowed construction and leasing concessions reflected the downside of

unregulated urban investment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#71:1> While failing to bring out the complete influence of local processes,

Feagin convincingly documented the transient ability of the secondary circuit

to absorb capital profitably.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#72:1> Investment in this circuit, like others, represented a short-term

solution to recurring crises of falling profits. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#73:1> King ( 1989a, 1989b, l989c) applied the circuits of capital model

to the Melbourne, Australia housing market between 1932 and 1985.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#74:1> He more substantively linked urban restructuring to microscale

processes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#75:1> In particular, the importance of constructed housing submarkets as

local investment influences was introduced.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#76:1> This process was purportedly most pronounced during periods of

capital overaccumulation in the primary circuit and subsequent economic

downturn.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#77:1> Thus, capital switching to the secondary circuit was facilitated by

two forces.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#78:1> The first, the initial tendency for investors to ignore the secondary

circuit with a robust primary circuit, subsequently made real estate

investment logical with falling profits in production.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#79:1> The second, the tendency for municipalities to build networks of

housing submarkets, ensured profitable real estate investment within socially

constructed islands.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#80:1> Social and economic processes were interwoven to depict a secondary

capital circuit that was stimulated by social constructions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#81:1> Uneven metropolitan restructuring that followed was reflected in

pockets of intensive reinvestment amidst broader stagnation and decline. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#82:1> King 's ( 1989a, 1989b, 1989c) sophisticated conceptualization did

not consider the full range of local influences.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#83:1> For example, he did not fully address local government incentives and

obstructions to the production of submarkets nor the facilitative and

idiosyncratic influence of key managers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#84:1> Thus, the influence of locality-specific regulations like historic

district designation, zoning, and tax abatement for upgrading properties were

ignored.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#85:1> These programs, moreover, were ostensibly controversial in granting

benefits to select populations and got mediated in unique and distinctive

ways by political operatives.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#86:1> Finally, the restructuring influence of community mores and standards

were subsumed under economic imperatives.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#87:1> Issues like local tolerance for segregation attempts to combat

residential discrimination, and cultural alliances among groups that could

weaken or strengthen existing submarkets remained unaddressed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#88:1> A superficial notion of locality was thus brought to bear on the

restructuring process. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#89:1> Such studies shed a wealth of insight on contemporary

metropolitan change.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#90:1> They fail, however, to fully integrate the importance of local

processes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#91:1> Metropolitan areas frequently emerge as " ideal types," exhibiting

little richness and substance to influence investment intensity and

distribution.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#92:1> Set against the powerful structural logic of capital shifting across

economic circuits and its inexorable uneven patterning, the local only mildly

mediates.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#93:1> Some local contingency and variability is recognized, but set against

the broader rhythms of capital accumulation, the local follows and adheres

rather than structures and shapes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#94:1> The following discussion illustrates the need to develop theory to

account for local influences.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#95:1> It documents the need to consider metropolitan areas as human

constructions differentially facilitative of investment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#96:1> It also documents local influences on uneven development.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#97:1> I focus on four US cities to demonstrate these points: New York City,

Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Indianapolis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#98:1> These cities, different in morphology, permit the impact of local

processes to be suitably documented. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#99:1> <h> <bold> Constructed Investment Opportunities </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#100:1> Circuits of capital/uneven development studies view metropolitan

investment as essentially a final effort to avoid broader economic crisis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#101:1> Investment purportedly flees the primary circuit and settles in the

built environment as an emergency outlet.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#102:1> The built environment. as a separate capital circuit, replenishes

investor profit margins.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#103:1> Thus, Harvey ( 1981, 111) depicted eighteenth century Britain as

engulfed by a capital glut that " had nowhere else to go."
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#104:1> The built environment appears as a godsend for the absorption of

surplus, overaccumulated capital" ( Harvey 1982,236).
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#105:1> Feagin ( 1985,190) depicted contemporary Houston as " a major place

for the investment of surplus capital a major outlet for overaccumulation of

capital in the primary circuit."
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#106:1> King ( 1989b, 711-38) described Melbourne as an outgrowth of "

crises of overaccumulation speculative money capital itself prone to

overaccumulation." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-014#107:1> Such interpretations minimize local investment incentives that

shape local restructuring intensity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#108:1> Yet built environments are not passive capital outlets, but dynamic

and evolving infrastructures differing in capacity to absorb profitable

investment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#109:1> Incentives for construction, often contested in their planning and

emergence, arise unevenly across places.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#110:1> While agents like builders, developers, realtors, and local

governments seek to implement incentives conducive to investment, tenant

groups, block clubs, and neighborhood associations work to create a livable

and humane urban area.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#111:1> The complex interplay between these groups structures investment

attractiveness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#112:1> To attract massive investment, various agents promote two processes,

socioeconomic differentiation and subsidized tax base redevelopment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#113:1> These actors are place entrepreneurs who strive for maximum

financial return through investing, renting, or taxing property.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#114:1> They implicitly reject the notion that noneconomic factors should

guide community development.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#115:1> Conflict over development in the political sphere defines the degree

to which they can achieve their agendas.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#116:1> While these actors do not necessarily conspire to create

socioeconomic differentiation and subsidized tax base redevelopment, the

short term pursuit of profit and political support often create them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-014#117:1> Successfully implanting these processes makes a built environment

attractive for massive investment. </p> </I>
