<I>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#1:1> As we pass beneath the Golden Gate Bridge on our way out to sea, I

look up and see the gold hammer and sickle on red emblazoned on the immense

stack of this 300-plus foot ship.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#2:1> It is October 1990.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#3:1> My home for the next three weeks, the research vessel<it>Akademik

Mstislav Keldysh</it>, is the flagship of the P.P. Shirshov Institute of

Oceanology and one of the prides of the Soviet Oceanographic Fleet, and

rightly so.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#4:1> Hailing from Kaliningrad, she is well fit for oceanographic duty, with

enough winches, davits, and A-frames to accommodate any requirement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#5:1> She can support 130 people in 18 laboratories, and she carries two

special pearls: the pair of small, three-person submersibles,<it>Mir

1</it>and<it>Mir 2</it>(<it>Mir</it>means " peace"), tucked protectively

beneath her hydraulically activated awnings on the starboard aft deck.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#6:1> The identical-twin<it>Mirs</it>were built for the Soviets by the

Finnish company Rauma-Repola in 1987 and 1988.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#7:1> Blimplike in shape, they sport a top deck painted international orange

for increased visibility on the water surface. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#8:1> <h> <bold> Launching the Pearls</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#9:1> On this sunny morning in Monterey Bay, I watch the preparations

for the day 's dives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#10:1> The routine is familiar to me: wrench- bearing technicians top off

hydraulic lines with fluid and adjust ballast; a pilot peers through the

forward viewport of<it>Mir 1</it>as he runs through predive checks of

manipulator functions; and replenishing supplies are passed into the crew

sphere.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#11:1> With the submersible ready to go, the diving team, outfitted in

sky-blue jumpsuits, pauses ritually at a threshold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#12:1> The three then emerge in order--copilot, scientist, pilot--and climb

up to the hatch and into the sphere.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#13:1> A complement of ship 's crew and scientists man the railings to watch

the launch progress.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#14:1> <it> Mir 1</it>is hoisted off the deck with a crane and lowered over

the side into the water.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#15:1> A swimmer from an inflatable life-boat leaps onto the sub and deftly

releases the lift line.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#16:1> A second boat tows<it>Mir 1</it>away from the ship and stands by

while the pilot completes the predive checks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#17:1> With checks complete and all lines clear,<it>Mir 1</it>begins her

60th descent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#18:1> An hour later,<it>Mir 2</it>is launched. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#19:1> At 60 dives each, the<it>Mir</it>boats are only babies compared

to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution 's submersible<it>Alvin</it>,

which I recently piloted on her 2,400th dive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#20:1> But the<it>Mirs</it>are first-class submersibles, destined for a

future of technically and scientifically successful dives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#21:1> Already, the Soviets have used them to explore seafloor sites

throughout the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#22:1> They have visited dive areas made familiar by<it>Alvin 's</it>work,

then moved outward to virgin seafloor where they continually find new

features of interest.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#23:1> In the next year or two, the<it>Mirs</it>will likely be the first

deep-diving boats to work the unexplored seafloor of the Indian Ocean, where

important scientific observations await.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#24:1> Designed and cleared to dive to 6,000 meters, the<it>Mirs</it>can

explore vast areas of the ocean 's bed that are inaccessible to<it>Alvin</it>.

</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#25:1> <h> <bold> Pilgrimage to Monterey and " Cannery Row"</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#26:1> We anchor off Monterey.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#27:1> Ship 's crew and scientists are given unrestricted leave to go ashore,

and the ship 's cutter is pressed into service as a ferry.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#28:1> For many of the scientists, and for myself, too, the visit to Ed

Ricketts 's<it>Cannery Row</it>laboratory is something of a pilgrimage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#29:1> One Soviet biologist, Lev Moskalev, shows me his well-thumbed copy of

John Steinbeck 's Cannery Row, wherein Ed Ricketts, a classic marine

biologist, is so colorfully portrayed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#30:1> Lev Moskalev is himself a great naturalist; his laboratory notebooks

are filled with careful observations, detailed sketches, queries, and

theories.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#31:1> Some of his queries are directed at my own research, and these

stimulate a congenial debate over our diverse interpretations of the natural

history of an animal we have both studied. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#32:1> As the Soviets invade the small town of Monterey, they invite

everyone they meet to an impromptu open house aboard<it>Keldysh</it>.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#33:1> The cutter runs continuously, carrying visitors to the ship.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#34:1> The guests are given tours, invited to meals, and asked to join crew

members in their staterooms for tea, wine, or vodka.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#35:1> Laughter and singing resonate in the passageways as the Russians

entertain their guests with unbounded graciousness and hospitality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#36:1> At midnight, under moonlight, the last guests hug their new friends

goodbye.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#37:1> With tears in their eyes, they reluctantly board the cutter to leave

the ship.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#38:1> We sail away at dawn. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#39:1> <h> <bold> A Record Dive to 4,065 Meters and an Abyssal

Plain</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#40:1> Another day, in deep water off Ensenada, Mexico, it is my turn to

dive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#41:1> I pause at the threshold wearing my borrowed jumpsuit and sporting

the gold dolphins that mark me as a US Navy- qualified, deep-submersible

pilot.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#42:1> As copilot on this dive, I am first to step out and climb into the

submarine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#43:1> I am followed by Julia Tchindonova and Dima Vasilyev.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#44:1> Our dive plan is straightforward.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#45:1> As the scientist on board, Julia will study the distribution of large

zooplankton in the water column.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#46:1> We descend slowly, 10 meters per minute, with the floodlights on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#47:1> Julia peers intently out the forward viewport, identifying and

counting the organisms that pass through a 1-cubic-meter frame held by one of

the manipulators.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#48:1> Between 500 meters and 1,000 meters, we pass through a layer that is

the daytime home of giant squid.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#49:1> Attracted to our lights, they approach the submarine and keep us

glued to the viewports.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#50:1> These animals ascend to the surface at night to feed, where they are

eagerly hooked beneath deck lights by the ship 's sailors.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#51:1> Squid flesh supplements the galley 's stores; squid beaks are

dissected out and kept as trophies. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#52:1> It is a long, six-hour descent that ultimately takes us to 4,065

meters and an abyssal plain of soft brown sediment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#53:1> For me, it is a personal depth record I won't be able to exceed

in<it>Alvin</it>.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#54:1> On the bottom, the pilot, Dima, passes control of the submersible to

me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#55:1> I find the sub agile, skimming over the soft sediment surface with

ease as I operate the joystick.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#56:1> Dima takes over and shows his skill and dexterity with the

manipulators.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#57:1> In every respect, he demonstrates the professionalism of an

experienced deep-submersible pilot. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#58:1> <h> <bold> Sampling the Sea and the Senses</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#59:1> On days that the submersibles do not dive, the ship is occupied

with other scientific activities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#60:1> For example, a large ( 150- liter) water-sampling bottle is

repeatedly serviced, hoisted off the stern, and lowered to different levels

in the water column where the bottle is tripped closed and the sample is

returned to the surface.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#61:1> Once on deck, water is siphoned from the bottle and distributed to a

myriad of laboratories for a carefully orchestrated suite of productivity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#62:1> This research program is being undertaken on a global scale; on this

voyage of<it>Keldysh</it>alone, hundreds of samples along a transect that

stretches from one shore of the Pacific 0cean to the other have been

collected and analyzed. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#63:1> Two men stand as silhouettes against the sun that sets over the

rugged desert mountains of the Baja Peninsula.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#64:1> With intense concentration, they parry and thrust their fist-sized

chessman across a checkered field.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#65:1> As I quietly enjoy this decidedly Russian vignette, Anatoly

Sagalevitch approaches.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#66:1> Sagalevitch-- his name gave me a pause at first, but now the

syllables tumble out in a satisfying rhythm: Sa-ga-le'-vitch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#67:1> He is an admirable man: scientist, engineer, skilled pilot, and

outstanding leader.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#68:1> The<it>Mirs</it>operate successfully because of his talents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#69:1> As we look out over the surface of the becalmed sea, we speak in

simplest Russian of the mysteries that lie beneath us, and we speak of our

submersibles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#70:1> Though our sentences are short and the conversation brief, we reach

beyond politics and pretenses to establish a professional bond that will last

throughout our careers as scientists and pilots. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#71:1> <h> <bold> Of Tube Worms, Mineral Chimneys, and Slurp Guns</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#72:1> We sail up the Gulf of California--the Sea of Cortez--and

the<it>Mirs</it>are again readied for dives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#73:1> Though<it>Keldysh</it>sails smoothly over the water, strong winds

have pushed up sizable waves that threaten to cancel our dive plans.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#74:1> Word is finally passed to carry on with the dives, and I climb

into<it>Mir 2</it>with two other pilots, Dima and Sagalevitch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#75:1> On this dive, Sagalevitch and I share the science program.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#76:1> We will dive on hydrothermal vent sites and use a slurp gun to sample

zooplankton in the water column around the vents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#77:1> Despite the rough seas our launch is flawless and we descend 25

meters per minute to the seafloor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#78:1> Once on the bottom, the submersible 's sonar picks up return signals

from mounds of sediment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#79:1> We drive toward one and find a vast colony of tube worms, bacterial

mats, and warm shimmering water at the top.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#80:1> Sagalevitch goes to work, positioning the submersible without

stirring up the sediment, setting up the pump, and sampling the water.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#81:1> With one sample collected, we move off to additional stations along a

transect away from the vent site.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#82:1> When the samples are processed back in the ship 's laboratory, we will

find out if bacterial production at the vent supports an enriched zooplankton

community in the overlying water column. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#83:1> As we sample, I peer out the viewport and see the eerie lights

of<it>Mir 1</it>working nearby.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#84:1> The two submersibles often dive together, each serving as a rescue

vehicle for the other.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#85:1> Eight hours into the dive, we finish sampling and confer with the

mother ship about weather conditions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#86:1> The sea state has worsened, we are told, and the decision is made to

stay submerged for another eight hours.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#87:1> This is a luxury<it>Alvin</it>cannot afford.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#88:1> <it> Alvin 's</it>power capacity limits its workday to 8 or 9 hours,

although in an emergency she can stay submerged up to 72 hours.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#89:1> The<it>Mirs</it>routinely submerge for 16 hours with full power (

although shorter dives are planned whenever a woman is scheduled to dive);

for emergencies, the<it>Mirs</it>also have extended submergence capabilities.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#90:1> With our extra bottom time, we decide to tour the hydrothermal

mounds in the area, traversing from one site to another using the sonar to

locate targets.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#91:1> Each mound is different.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#92:1> Some have profuse animal communities with diffuse venting of

low-temperature water; others are ornamented with pagodalike mineral chimneys

and inverted hot-water pools; and still others appear as relicts of former

hydrothermal activity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#93:1> We select one hot-water site and Sagalevitch begins to collect

physical measurement sets that he will use to estimate the hydrothermal

energy emitted by the vent. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#94:1> It is well into night by the time we return to the surface.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#95:1> The seas are still unsettled and the recoveries are prolonged.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#96:1> Finally, sheets of water flow past the viewports as we are plucked

from the sea and come to rest on deck.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#97:1> Elvira Shuskina, the chief scientist on the cruise; takes over,

carefully transferring samples from the collecting chambers to bottles for

preservation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#98:1> The next day, Elvira and her colleagues sort through the samples and

make a preliminary organism count.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#99:1> With considerable excitement, they report finding peculiar-looking

larval stages of some of the animals that colonize the vents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#100:1> Eventually, we hope that analyses of these samples and others will

help us understand how animal communities persist at vent sites and how new

vent sites are colonized. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#101:1> <h> <bold> The Rhythm of Life at Sea</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#102:1> Three weeks on my adopted ship pass by far too quickly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#103:1> Rituals like tea with the<it>Mir</it>pilots and technicians in the

morning, and sauna with the women scientists twice a week, begin to define

the rhythm of life at sea.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#104:1> Friendships develop rapidly within the closed society of a ship 's

community, and it is only reluctantly that I leave my new friends and

colleagues. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#105:1> I spend my last evening on board first with the scientists I

worked with and then in the company of the submersible crew.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#106:1> Sagalevitch draws the evening to a close with a ballad that tells of

the courage and dedication of those who dive to the seafloor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#107:1> His voice alone carries the melody at first; then, one by one, the

other men join in until a chorus of 20-odd sings to me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#108:1> Finally, I pick up the Russian words, and we sing the last lines

together. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#109:1> Cindy Lee Van Dover is a Postdoctoral Investigator in the

Biology Department of the Woods Hole oceanographic Institution ( WHOI) and a

pilot of WHOI 's submersible<it>Alvin</it>. </p> <&> N.B. Chart

removed-Darrell Penta</&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#110:1> The ocean is Earth 's oldest habitat, so it comes as no surprise

that it is also the most diverse.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#111:1> This diversity extends into all realms of marine life, as organisms

have evolved to exploit every imaginable advantage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#112:1> It follows that marine animals would employ a wider variety of

reproductive means than their land- based counterparts, and this is the case.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#113:1> In this issue, we highlight the reproductive modes of various

animals, from the perspectives of the researchers studying them. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#114:1> <h> <bold> Sex? Asex? Both?</bold></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-026#115:1> At the most general we divide reproduction into two categories:

asexual and sexual.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#116:1> Asexual reproduction is the oldest and simplest form of

reproduction, by which one parent 's body divides or breaks apart in some way

to produce offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-026#117:1> Asexual reproduction methods include<it>fission</it>, where a

parent 's body splits into two more-or-less equal parts;<it>budding</it>,

where a small part of a parent 's body becomes differentiated and separates

from the rest; and<it>fragmentation</it>, where a parent 's body breaks into

many pieces and each piece develops into an offspring ( starfish can regrow

an entire body from a single broken-off arm this way). </p> </I>
