<p> <it> The following article summarizes the findings and conclusions of a

case study that was undertaken as part of the author 's master 's thesis at

MIT.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#2:1> Ford Foundation Professor Frank Jones served as advisor.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#3:1> The study is part of an overall strategy to develop a National Black

Veterans Network in conjunction with the Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse,

Inc., and the Congressional Black Caucus Veterans Braintrust.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#4:1> It is hoped that the study will provide a planning, research, and

educational tool to enhance organizing and affordable housing development

efforts on behalf of black veterans across the country.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#5:1> Future research is being proposed on a national scale to examine the

success of stitch organizing efforts in order to understand the ways in which

black veterans cat' implement strategies for community development and

initiate other self-help initiatives. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#6:1> Eighteen years have passed since the official end of the Vietnam

War in 1975 and the unceremonious homecoming of Vietnam veterans.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#7:1> The unpopularity of the war placed side by side with the civil rights

and Black Power movements made the homecoming and transition experience into

post-military adjustment even more difficult for black veterans.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#8:1> Nevertheless, the ensuing years saw black Vietnam-era veterans

attempting to adjust and organize along many fronts as an attempt to create

meaning and define their space within a landscape of social, political and

economic upheaval and unrest. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#9:1> These organizing efforts and strategies met with varying degrees

of success or failure, but never reached the magnitude of a social movement.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#10:1> Many veteran activists like myself have participated in the process

of organizing so many groups, associations, organizations, conferences, and

meetings over the past eighteen to twenty years that time and space limit my

ability to recall all their names.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#11:1> Yet, all too often these efforts based on good intentions and 'felt

need" have resulted in group self-destruction within six months of

origination, or failed to provide long-term solutions to veterans social

problems.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#12:1> No study to date has been conducted of Vietnam-era veterans'

organizing efforts, particularly those of black Vietnam-era veterans.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#13:1> Thus, eighteen to twenty years after the Vietnam War, we know little

about the factors involved in successful self-help organizing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#14:1> With this in mind, I began the process of questioning and

reexamining the possibility of comparatively studying a select number of

successful nonprofit organizations and their leadership to determine what

strengths would be revealed regarding their success.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#15:1> Two questions for examination were: did military service contribute

to their organizational successes in terms of skills, attitudes, or behavior?

But more importantly, how would black Vietnam-era veterans themselves

describe self-help organizing and organizational and community development--

the struggles and barriers as well as opportunities for social reintegration

within thy community setting? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#16:1> Three assertions guided me while considering these questions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#17:1> First, blacks in Vietnam had paid a high price and consequently had

made certain vows and promises about becoming social change agents when they

returned to the " world."
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#18:1> As Wayne Smith, a former Vietnam combat medic, said, " What ever

happened to the promise that we were going to change the world?"1 Second, the

ability to establish a feeling of brotherhood or male bonding was a positive

and intangible asset from the war experience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#19:1> Third, Vietnam 's military small unit tactics were tangible

illustrations of how small groups of committed individuals could overcome

major obstacles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#20:1> This study attempts to ascertain if any aspect of these assertions

has carried over into civilian life or been recaptured as a strength or

building block for organizational and community development. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#21:1> <h> <bold> Models for Community Change </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#22:1> The study examined three nonprofit organizations in the

Northeastern United States: the Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse, Inc,, of

Roxbury, Massachusetts, Black Veterans for Social Justice, Inc., of Brooklyn,

New York, and Western New York Veterans Housing Coalition, of Buffalo, New

York.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#23:1> These three organizations formed the nucleus for gathering

information about successful strategies and tactics involving organizing,

organizational and affordable housing development, attracting specialized

resources, and garnering political and community support.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#24:1> Further, the study proposed that a typology or model for replication

exists in these examples for self-help organizing around the country. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#25:1> All three were organized since the end of the Vietnam War as a

response to felt need in their respective communities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#26:1> Thus, these community-based organizations represent efforts by black

veterans to reconnect with black community life.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#27:1> Furthermore, they represent symbolically untapped human resources

contained in various communities around the country. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#28:1> The study focused on examining why these three organizations were

successful when other black veterans organizing attempts were failures; if

military service was a determining or contributing factor for their success;

and, whether these factors or attributes were present in all three veterans

and, if so, whether a formula could be developed based on these factors for

replication in other parts of the country.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#29:1> The study also examined how these factors might manifest themselves

in organizing community-based organizations for community development. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#30:1> Over a three-year period, interviews were conducted with the

organizations' leaders: Mr. Ralph Cooper, executive director of the Veterans

Benefits clearinghouse; Mr. Job Mashariki, director of Black Veterans for

Social Justice, and Mr. Jerry Bowman, vice-president of Western New York

Veterans Housing Coalition between 1988 and 1990.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#31:1> These three-hour interviews consisted of categorical questions using

an ethnographic research approach recommended by Dr. Carlos Brossard. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#32:1> The study 's principal value is its theoretical veterans community

development model emphasizing the role played by military service, organizing

and organizational development, higher education, relationship building,

interpersonal skills, leadership, racial consciousness, and social activism

on behalf of self-help.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#33:1> In this sense, the study represents a purposive sample and its goal

is simply to give definition to a theory for veterans' supplementing

community development efforts and a model for community application or

practice. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#34:1> Self-help offered these veterans a window of opportunity to

offset feelings of need, negativity, frustration, hopelessness and

helplessness with programmatic responses.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#35:1> At the same time, necessity merely sanctioned what had already become

self-help practices.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#36:1> The idea of self-help motivated veterans to come together as a group

and strive towards creating long-term solutions to their social problems,

while expanding the realm of possibilities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#37:1> This acknowledgment, however, should not dismiss the importance of a

community context. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#38:1> The overall goal of the study was to take a new approach to

examining black Vietnam-era veterans focusing on factors of successful

organizing and development of community-based nonprofit organizations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#39:1> It also sought to investigate and understand black leadership

attributes, rather than fall prey to continuing depictions of black

Vietnam-era veterans as a tragic problem group. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#40:1> The study examined the following premises: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#41:1> ( Black veterans are an untapped resource within the black

community; </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#42:1> ( Community development offers a window of opportunity for black

Vietnam-era veterans to become integrated into the community setting; and,

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#43:1> ( Homelessness and affordable housing development offer future

areas of potential conflict and opportunity for black veterans; </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#44:1> <h> <bold> The Effect of Military Service on Successful Organizing

</bold> </h>

<p> <it>
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#45:1> Human capital formation </it> by definition is added value or

increase in human capacity through both generalized and specialized skills

and training.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#46:1> The assertion here is that military service contributes to human

capital formation versus being merely an instrument of U.S. foreign policy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#47:1> Military service provides a modicum of tangible attributes through

training, travel, occupational and leadership development, not to mention the

intangible attributes of certain social behaviors, including interdependency,

discipline, camaraderie, small-group cohesion, and teamwork, among others.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#48:1> However, the study unevenly reflects the impact of military

service on human capital formation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#49:1> Only one of the three interviewees reported being in Vietnam and

drawing on the lessons of Vietnam when addressing present day problems and

situational difficulties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#50:1> The second stated that he did not think the military did much for his

development, but then contradicted himself later in the interview when he

noted that he traveled, experienced foreign cultures, acquired language

skills, and felt for the first time felt he was received as a human being,

rather than as a " nigger."
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#51:1> He added that he felt this experience would be with him forever.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#52:1> The third veteran did not discuss his military experience to any

degree. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#53:1> The study is, therefore, somewhat ambiguous as it relates to the

extent that military service might be a developer of human capital.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#54:1> Yet, while the veterans themselves were reluctant to attribute any

good to their military experience, the study found that military service had

in fact a profound socializing effect on their lives.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#55:1> The military as an autocratic organization imposed discipline and

order and frequently aided in sharpening critical assessment skills.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#56:1> In addition, it facilitated their ability to improvise more readily

and become more mission- or task-oriented.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#57:1> The acquisition of this kind of operational discipline, coupled with

the veterans' natural talents, proved to be a factor in successful

organizing. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#58:1> <h> <bold> Veterans' Roles in the Community </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#59:1> All three veterans' backgrounds are rooted in community

organizing and organizational development.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#60:1> All three men built local reputations as political activists on

behalf of the broader array of black community concerns.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#61:1> Community organizing was a springboard for approaching the problems

of black veterans from a self-help and community-based organizational

perspective.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#62:1> All three mentioned seeing self-help organizing, social services

delivery, and affordable housing development targeted towards black veterans

as a continuation of their efforts at addressing community problems at large.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#63:1> In Buffalo, the demise of industry or blue collar manufacturing

jobs, the continuation of white Irish political control, and finally an

increasingly vocal black population precipitated the community organizing

efforts of Jerry Bowman and his founding of the Black Community Information

Center.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#64:1> Job Mashariki helped to organize the East Cultural and Education

Center, arrange economic boycotts of downtown businesses, and establish the

Randolph Evans Funds in Brooklyn, New York, the city 's largest borough where

a large, progressive, and even militant segment of the population, largely

African and Caribbean American, has had a long history of community

involvement and political control extending from the local neighborhoods to

the congressional district.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#65:1> In Boston, similar to parts of the southern United States, school

busing during the 1970s and its aftermath of racial violence, polarization,

and struggle for political control between the white Irish and the black

population led to Boston 's being labeled " the most racist city in America."
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#66:1> Yet, despite this, Ralph Cooper opened the first Veterans Peer

Assistance Counseling Program in the city of Boston on the campus of Boston

State College, co-founded the Veterans Club and the Veterans Benefits

Clearinghouse, and after graduation was awarded a Commonwealth of

Massachusetts Fellowship and field placement at the Roxbury Multi-Service

Center, one of the oldest and largest social service organizations in

Boston 's black community, to learn the internal workings of a community

agency. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#67:1> <h> <bold> The Role of Higher Education </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#68:1> The study found that attending college played a major role in the

post-military resocialization into civilian life and contributed to the

personal growth and professional development of the three veterans.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#69:1> As older students possessing maturity and experience, college

provided them with an academic and intellectual type of discipline and

challenge not associated with military service.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#70:1> Most importantly, it provided an environment conducive to short- term

economic survival, learning and teaching, and, lastly, institutional

maneuvering or manipulation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#71:1> These black veteran organizers viewed higher education, social

activism, and life-long learning in a positive light. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#72:1> The college backgrounds and organizational histories of the three

veterans interviewed revealed certain commonalities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#73:1> All three attended college after the military and therefore brought a

host of personal resources to the task of campus organizing, academic

achievement, and community activism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#74:1> In Boston, Ralph Cooper and others organized the Veterans Club on the

campus of Boston State College which was later incorporated as the Veterans

Benefits Clearinghouse; in Brooklyn, Job Mashariki attended New York State

College while working at the Veterans Administration community storefront ( a

precursor to the Vet Centers, the Veterans Administration 's version of a

community-based organization) contributing to community activism, and

organizing the Black Veterans for Social Justice; and, in Buffalo, Jerry

Bowman organized the Third World Veterans Association on the campus of

University of Buffalo and later assisted in establishing the Buffalo Vet

Center.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#75:1> While employed at the Vet Center, Bowman also organized and assisted

veterans in the Attica State Prison over a ten-year period.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#76:1> His advocacy work begun in the community at large finally culminated

in the development of the Western New York Veterans Housing Coalition. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#77:1> <h> <bold> Organizational Philosophies: Similarities and Differences,

Strengths and Weaknesses </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#78:1> The missions of all three organizations are based on providing

action- oriented responses to felt need, but their resulting success and

evolution warrant further scrutiny.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#79:1> This is particularly true of the Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse and

Black Veterans for Social Justice.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#80:1> The immense task of organizing and sustaining organizational growth

and development within a black context and without previous models has not

been fully or even partially documented.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#81:1> In reality, race and veterans issues are not everyday political and

social priorities for most of society.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#82:1> Therefore, organizing specifically around black veterans' issues is

slower and substantially more difficult than other types of organizing

efforts, a fact that makes the success of these three black veteran

organizers all the more remarkable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-011#83:1> According to the study, there are basic similarities and

differences in the organizational structuring, staff composition and

operation of the three groups.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#84:1> The Western New York Veterans Housing Coalition is governed by its

board of directors and has no staff with the exception of a project manager.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#85:1> The members of the board of directors are volunteers and are composed

of ethnically diverse, social service agency representatives as well as

established businessmen.
<ICE-USA:W2A-011#86:1> In the majority of instances, they are Vietnam veterans or at least

emotionally connected to the issue of Vietnam. </p> </I>
