<ICE-USA:W1A-008#1:1> <h> 1. Discuss Behaviorism versus Innatism</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#2:1> Behaviorism: Initial attempts to explain first language

acquisition were provided by B.F. Skinner ( 1957, 1968) and the Behaviorists

school of thought.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#3:1> On the surface, it is easy to understand why Behaviorists make an

analogy between the types of behavior studied by Skinner and verbal behavior.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#4:1> After all, numerous controlled experiments prove that animals may be

trained into a behavior if the operant ( desired response) that it produces

is continually reinforced through reward.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#5:1> This viewpoint, understood in the framework of an operant

conditioning/ S-R-R model, posits through analogy that infants must learn to

speak by trying out their language ( stimulus), and that when they succeed in

communicating ( response), the reward that they receive encourages them to

develop appropriate verbal habits.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#6:1> In this manner, the child learning to speak is like a tabula rasa, or

blank slate, that acquires all its behavioral tendencies ( including

language) through systematically rewarded behavior.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#7:1> Thus, it is " nurture" that creates a fully functioning language user

and it is the reward one receives for correctly mimicking and displaying

appropriate forms that results in children becoming competent speakers.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#8:1> The behaviorist model contends that no cognition occurs in the passive

language learner; instead, the speaker 's psychomotor skills are developed

through the S-R-R model, and only observable behavior is considered relevant

to the discussion.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#9:1> Applying this to the topic of African American vernacular English,

then, the Behaviorist approach would argue that some population of America 's

blacks would have to have been raised in households in which only certain

grammatical constructions were rewarded and in which others were not.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#10:1> For example, one standard feature of AAVE is the loss of the

third-person present " - s" marker on verbs, so that Standard English " He

writes" would appear as " He write."
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#11:1> In order for this feature to be acquired by infants, according to

Behaviorists, it would need to be continually reinforced as correct verbal

behavior; furthermore, the acquisition of Standard English 's " - s" marker in

such an environment would not occur unless it received similar reward.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#12:1> While I don't believe it is rational to totally dismiss the language

environment of the home and the role that caregivers play in the process of

acquisition, I do believe that such a reductive view of language acquisition

fails to fully account for the full experience of acquiring one 's first

language.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#13:1> This same point was first articulated by members of the Innatists

camp, described below.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#14:1> Innatism: Noam Chomsky was one of the first researchers who

sought to replace the idea of " nuture" with one of " nature."

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#15:1> As the preeminent Innatist scholar, Chomsky ( 1965) raised a

number of important questions about language development in children that

simply could not be accounted for by Skinner.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#16:1> For example, if a child was like a blank slate, he inquired, intaking

and repeating the " correct" language around them, why do children not speak

in parentese--the prosodically and structurally marked baby-talk to which

many children are exposed?
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#17:1> Furthermore, how do we account for language development in those

cultures where adults do not speak directly to children?
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#18:1> Chomsky 's theory posited the notion of poverty of stimulus;

contending that almost all utterances are truly novel, and that as result,

children can not possibly be exposed to all the correct types of language

structures.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#19:1> Simply stated, there are just not enough stimuli during the child 's

developmental stages to accurately hypothesize a process of

internalization-through-mimicry.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#20:1> In the class video Language Series Part 2, Pinker also points out

that a child, even when corrected, is likely to ignore such correction and

make the same mistakes again and again.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#21:1> Chomsky also addresses in this video a problem with the Behaviorist 's

belief that a child would learn appropriate patterns for word classes, and

then extend those patterns to create new utterances.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#22:1> His case is made with a " red barn," example, which shows how the

construction, " I painted the barn red/the red barn," does not allow for a

simple replacement in the verb category: " I saw the red barn./ ! I saw the

barn red." In other words, the idea that a child could generate novel

utterances by learning and extending patterns to which they have been exposed

was ineffective for accounting for real language acquisition.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#23:1> Rather than " nurture," Chomsky and other scholars ( Lenneberg:

1967, MacNeill: 1968) believe that human beings are born with a

species-specific Language Acquisition Device, an innate system embedded with

universal principles that, after being shaped by exposure to language

structures, selects appropriate parameters to generate a discreetly infinite

number of grammatical constructions in the language into which a learner is

born.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#24:1> Accordingly, Chomsky has contended, children " grow" language in the

same way that birds " grow" wings.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#25:1> The system may be viewed as a series of switches, turned on or off by

the demands of the native language, that serially generate the rules for

language production.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#26:1> Such a device provides language users with a deep ( possibly sub- or

un-conscious) awareness of their native language 's sounds and structures.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#27:1> According to MacNeill, the LAD contains at least four linguistic

properties: the ability to distinguish speech sounds from other sounds in

nature, the ability to organize linguistic data into classes that cane later

be modified, the ability to recognize that only some language systems are

possible, while others are impossible, and finally, the ability to evaluate

the developing linguistic system so as to construct the simplest possible

system out of the available linguistic input ( Brown, 24).
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#28:1> In effect, Brown ( 2000) summarizes this perspective in contrast to

Behaviorism by arguing that child language development is not a matter of

gradually decreasing " incorrect" structures, but instead, is a process in

which " the child is constantly forming hypotheses " [ which] are continually

revised, reshaped, or sometimes abandoned."(25)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#29:1> Although such features as hypotheses formation are almost

impossible to prove, the model described above is not without its merits.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#30:1> The phenomenon of language in nearly all humans, coupled with the

fact that numerous languages share common features offers some support for

the notion of a Universal Grammar, which we might define as the LAD 's initial

state before parameters have been set.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#31:1> Yet I would argue that such a model neglects important considerations

with respect to the role that socialization plays in the process of language

acquisition.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#32:1> Reducing the process to the most basic features of physiology, for

example, also assumes that language learners are passive and have no control

over their own development.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#33:1> In the case of our AEMP students, the UG hypothesis does not account

for the reasons why certain structures may appear more frequently in the

speech of their respective language communities than in others.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#34:1> Critiques of this model were raised by Social Interactionsits, who

will be discussed below.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#35:1> <h> 2. Discuss the important concepts in Social Interactionism </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#36:1> Important theories of language acquisition came through the work

of Piaget ( 1972), Bloom ( 1971) and others, who examined the ways in which a

child 's cognitive abilities might be related to their language abilities.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#37:1> In a developmental model such as Piaget 's, a child 's interaction with

the world is a factor in the child 's development, and corresponds to an

increase in cognitive abilities.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#38:1> As Brown explains, Piaget " described overall development as the

result of children 's interaction with their environment"(29)
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#39:1> Here, we have an example of the child-learner not as passive in the

process of learning language, but rather, as increasingly aware of language

in the real-world environment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#40:1> Whereas Innatist theorists were concerned with the underlying

forms of language, this approach allowed researchers to consider the ways in

which the pragmatic nature of language--the part of language that allows us

to engage with our environment--might be a driving force behind the

developing of language in humans.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#41:1> This is understood as a functional, rather than a formal,

consideration.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#42:1> Dan Slobin ( 1971, 1986) asserts that language development is couched

in the need to acquire an increasingly complex semantic schema--that is, the

need to use language to interact with the environment--which in turn,

triggers those processing capabilities concerned with the grammatical and

structural forms of language. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#43:1> In the same functional scope of language development, the Social

Interactionists are also interested in the ways in which the

language-learners environment sets the pace at which a child learns.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#44:1> However, unlike strict Behaviorists, Social Interactionists also

accept that fact that language structure is unique and unlike other

behaviors.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#45:1> For these researchers, the structure of language manifests as such

due to the need of people to interact socially, and so the function of

language, more than the form, becomes the important component.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#46:1> Instead of mimicking the language of their parents, children,

according to Social Interactionists, receive cues about language through

acculturation, or through the familiarization/confrontation of the

socio-historic specificities of their real-world conditions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#47:1> These include such things as economic standing, access to educational

materials, and the status of an individual 's language with respect to

society-at-large.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#48:1> Language as part of cultural capital, does not exist in a vacuum and

can not be disarticulated from its relationship to the language user; rather,

it is part of a cultural capital " package" that contains, " forms of

knowledge; skill; education; and any advantages a person has which give them

a higher status in society, including high expectations" ( " Cultural

capital," Wikipedia.org, 2005)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#49:1> Accepting the role that these conditions play in the development

of language, we might assert that as interactions with the real-world become

more complex, so too does the internal language faculty.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#50:1> This particular was taken up by Vygotsky 's ( 1978), who argued that

language-based social interaction is actually the precursor to cognitive

development.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#51:1> His suggestion of a zone of proximal development has been used to

characterize the distance between a learner 's potential development and the

current state of their cognition.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#52:1> Thus, language is taken to be a tool for children to begin the

process of social interaction, and an example of this is Child Directed

Speech--a type of speech game in which a child is able to manipulate the

language/behavior of those around her in such a way as to learn the important

structural, semantic, and pragmatic clues that children use to engage with

the world.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#53:1> Researchers like Holzman ( 1984), developed this idea further by

suggesting a " reciprocal" or " bidirectional model" of language which

essential states that it is the caregiver 's relationship to the child that

creates the parameters by which a child will learn to use language.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#54:1> That is to say that even CDS is guided by the concrete reality that

surrounds a child, so that a child 's response ( attention, speech, etc.)

shapes the caregivers output, and vice versa.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-008#55:1> There is evidence that CDS play an important role in a

child 'schild 's language development, but it is also accepted that CDS does

not appear in all languages, and is not uniform when it does appear.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#56:1> Brice Heath ( 2006), for instance, was able to produce data on the

ways that differing socio-cultural environments could shape the types of

linguistic input that children received.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#57:1> Comparing two working-class communities-- Trackton, a black

community, and Roadville, a white community--Brice Heath " documented how

their quite distinct ways of learning language affected their integration

into academic life" for " each differed from expectations the mainstream

families and schools held about uses of language."
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#58:1> In short, we see the emergence of socio-historical and economic

actualities taking a much greater role in the process of language

acquisition. </p>

<p> This phenomenon, often referred to as the home-school cultural mismatch,

accounts for the fact that differences between the cultures to which children

are exposed in the familial setting and in the school setting can be highly

problematic for students when schools fail to recognize the differences.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#59:1> In the case of the AEMP model, there seems to be an informed

awareness of this mismatch as a root problem in the performance gap.
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#60:1> The antithesis of this awareness is manifest in the question posed by

the student who asked, " If blacks in America are being exposed to the same

type of English that they are, why aren't they learning Standard English?"
<ICE-USA:W1A-008#61:1> A Social Interactionist perspective, I argue, provides us with the

clues to answer this question appropriately: In any given culture, different

competencies are valued over other, as are the various types of abilities

that language-users possess.</p> </I>
