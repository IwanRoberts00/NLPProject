<ICE-USA:W2D-001#2:1> <h> Guide to Massachusetts Tax and Employer Obligations Overview of

Filing Requirements and Options</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#3:1> You will use different returns and follow different filing

schedules depending on the amount of each trustee tax you expect to collect

or excise tax you owe annually.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#4:1> To make filing and payment of taxes faster, more accurate, and more

convenient for taxpayers, Department of Revenue has several electronic filing

and payment options which are discussed in this section.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#5:1> <h> Return Filing Options</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#6:1> After registering, you have the option of filing sales and

withholding tax returns from a personal computer using free " PC File"

software.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#7:1> Sales and withholding taxpayers participating in electronic funds

transfer ( see Payment Options), have the added option of using Business

Telefile to file their sales and withholding tax returns using a touch-tone

telephone.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#8:1> However, regardless of whether you use PC File software or

Business Telefile, after you have registered, the Department of Revenue will

mail you forms preprinted with your firm 's name, address, and identification

number, for all of the trustee tax types for which you have registered.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#9:1> Most forms come in a booklet ( and resemble loan payment coupon

booklets).
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#10:1> Note: If your business size makes you an annual filer, you will not

receive your form until December of the year for which you are filing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#11:1> If you do not plan to use PC File software or Business Telefile,

or in the case of the tax types not covered by PC File software or Business

Telefile, Department of Revenue urges you to use your preprinted forms, which

will facilitate accurate and timely processing of your returns.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#12:1> All returns must be postmarked by the U.S.Postal Service at least

two days prior to the due date of the return or be received by Department of

Revenue on or before the due date to be considered on time.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#13:1> <h> Payment Options</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#14:1> Depending on which trustee taxes you collect and your annual

liability for each tax type, you may be mandated to make certain trustee and

other tax payments through electronic funds transfer ( EFT), or have the

option of doing so.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#15:1> EFT payments are mandatory for taxpayers who have over

&dollar;250,000 in annual liabilities for withholding and sales and use ( including

sales and use tax on telecommunication services).
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#16:1> EFT is also mandatory for corporations, domestic and foreign, with

annual liabilities over

&dollar;250,000, and for taxpayers with annual gasoline, financial institution,

insurance, and utility excise tax liabilities over

&dollar;100,000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#17:1> There are two methods available for making EFT payments: ACH (

Automated Clearing House) Credit-- The ACH Credit method is restricted to

certain tax types and filing frequencies ( refer to charts in More about

Specific Trustee and Excise Taxes Requiring Registration below).
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#18:1> This method requires the taxpayer to instruct its financial

institution to transfer money to Department of Revenue Application for

participation is required.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#19:1> After applying you will receive a personal identification number (

PIN) which can also be used for Business Telefile.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#20:1> Mass-Debit ( ACH Debit)--This method allows the taxpayer to make tax

payments via touch-tone telephone.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#21:1> Any business taxpayer registered with Department of Revenue is

eligible to use this payment method.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#22:1> Application for participation is required.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#23:1> After applying you will receive a PIN which can also be used for

Business Telefile.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#24:1> For more information about Business Telefile, EFT, and how ACH

Credit and Mass-Debit work, see Business Options: Electronic Filing and

Payment Programs on Department of Revenue 's Web site or contact the

Department of Revenue 's Automated Processing Bureau by phone at ( 617)

887-5020 or by fax at ( 617) 887-5019.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#25:1> <h> Income Tax Withholding</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#26:1> Income tax withholding is the withholding of a portion of

employee wages for state and federal income tax purposes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#27:1> As a general rule, the owner of a business that is incorporated is

also considered an employee for withholding tax purposes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#28:1> If you were the sole proprietor of a business that has no other

employees, you would not be considered an employee and would not be required

to register for withholding tax.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#29:1> ( However, as the owner you are required to make individual estimated

income tax payments if you expect to owe more than

&dollar;200 in Massachusetts income tax on the income you receive from the business.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#30:1> See Sole Proprietorships Estimated Payments.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#31:1> The amount you withhold from your employees for state income tax

purposes should be based on Form M-4, Massachusetts Employee 's Withholding

Exemption Certificate ( submitted to you by each employee), and on Circular

M, Massachusetts Income Tax Withholding Tables.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#32:1> A detailed explanation of how to use the tables or a percentage

method for automated payroll systems is provided in Circular M.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#33:1> The IRS and Social Security Administration ( SSA) also require

employers to withhold federal income tax and social security contributions

from employee wages.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#34:1> Resources for obtaining additional information about your federal

obligations are listed in the Help and Resources section at the end of this

guide.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#35:1> If you plan to selltangible personal property items, meals, or

certain telecommunications services you must register with Department of

Revenue as a sales tax vendor and collect a 5 percent Massachusetts sales

tax.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#36:1> The Massachusetts sales and use tax applies to sales of tangible

personal property.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#37:1> Even if you are selling tangible personal property items at a

wholesale level ( i.e., for eventual resale at the retail level), you still

must register as a sales tax vendor.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#38:1> All sales tax vendors must file the appropriate return ( Form ST-9

series); see overview of filing requirements above for electronic filing and

payment options, and chart below for additional specifics).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#39:1> Certain items are exempt from sales tax, such as items of

clothing under

&dollar;175 and food not purchased for immediate consumption.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#40:1> See A Guide to Sales and Use Tax for more information on the sales

tax, including what is exempt.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#41:1> <h> Sales Tax on Meals</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#42:1> The Massachusetts sales tax also applies to meals, which

Massachusetts law defines as any food or beverage that has been prepared for

immediate consumption, including items sold on a take-out basis.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#43:1> Meals can be purchased from restaurants, any part of a store

considered by Massachusetts law to be a restaurant, and other venues such as

street carts and vending machines.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#44:1> The tax is 5 percent of the sales price of the meal.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#45:1> The Form ST-MAB-4, Sales Tax on Meals, Prepared Foods and All

Beverages Return, is filed monthly and is due on or before the 20th day of

the following month.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#46:1> Payment is due with the return.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#47:1> See the chart below and A Guide to Sales Tax on Meals or the TA-1

instructions for additional details.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#48:1> <h> Sales Tax on Telecommunications Services</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#49:1> Telecommunications services include telephone and other

transmissions of information ( such as beeper services, cellular telephone

services, and telegram services).
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#50:1> Cable television, Internet access and related online computer

services are exempt from the sales tax.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#51:1> Generally, the tax on the sale or use of telecommunications services

is a tax on the transmission of messages or information by various electronic

means, but not on the sale or use of information itself.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#52:1> All vendors must file the appropriate return ( Form STS-M or - Q);

see chart below.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#53:1> See A Guide to Sales and Use Tax or the TA-1 instructions for

additional details.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#54:1> <h> Use Tax</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#55:1> The use tax is 5 percent of the purchase price or rental charge

on tangible personal property ( including mail order items) on which no sales

tax, or a sales tax less than 5 percent, was collected, and which are to be

used, stored or consumed in the Commonwealth.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#56:1> Unlike the regular sales tax, the purchaser generally pays the use

tax directly to the Commonwealth.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#57:1> For example, if you purchase furniture for your Massachusetts

business from an out-of-state firm and pay no sales tax, you are required to

pay the 5 percent use tax.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#58:1> If you are registered to collect sales taxes, you can report and pay

use taxes on your regular sales and use tax return.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#59:1> Otherwise, if you only make occasional purchases subject to use tax,

you can file and pay use taxes using the ST-10 Business Use Tax Return or the

ST-11 Individual Use Tax Return.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#60:1> See A Guide to Sales and Use Tax or the TA-1 instructions for

additional details.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#61:1> <h> Exempt Sales</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#62:1> In addition to exempting specific items, like articles of

clothing under

&dollar;175, from sales tax, the law exempts other types of purchases.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#63:1> For example: Sales where the purchaser intends to resell the item in

the regular course of business are exempt.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#64:1> In these cases, a Form ST-4, Resale Certificate, must be given to and

retained by the seller as proof the sale was exempt for that reason.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#65:1> Purchasers must be registered sales/use tax vendors to obtain this

exemption.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#66:1> They can obtain the Form ST-4 by calling the Department of Revenue 's

Customer Service Bureau at ( 617) 887-6367 or toll-free in Massachusetts at 1

( 800) 392-6089.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#67:1> Sales of materials, tools, fuel, machinery and replacement parts,

which will be used directly and exclusively in the manufacture, processing or

conversion of tangible personal property to be sold, are exempt in many

cases.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#68:1> The vendor must receive from the purchaser a Form ST-12 , Exempt Use

Certificate, and maintain proper records on such sales.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#69:1> Sales to organizations that have tax-exempt status are generally

exempt from sales tax.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#70:1> The purchaser must present the seller with the appropriate exempt

purchaser certificate to obtain the exemption.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#71:1> The two basic categories of tax-exempt purchasers are governmental

organizations and charitable and nonprofit organizations.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#72:1> To obtain an exempt purchaser certificate, purchasers must register

with the Department of Revenue ( by completing the TA-1 registration).
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#73:1> Please note: Tax-exempt organizations that sell tangible personal

property or telecommunications services on a regular basis are considered

vendors and are required to collect sales/use tax.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#74:1> Because of the complexity of the law, some guidelines listed here

may not apply to every transaction.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#75:1> Be sure to consult A Guide to Sales and Use Tax or the TA-1

instructions for additional information on other types of exempt sales and

details on the examples above.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#76:1> See also Massachusetts Regulation 830 CMR 64H.8.1, which discusses

resale and exempt use certificates.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#77:1> To avoid any interest or penalty charges on sales tax that was not

collected properly, taxpayers with questions about the taxability of any sale

should contact the Department of Revenue.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#78:1> See the Help and Resources section at the end of this guide.</p> <p

<Massachusetts imposes a room occupancy e xcise tax of 5.7 percent on rooms

rented for

&dollar;15 or more per day.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#79:1> And each Massachusetts city and town has the option of levying up to

an additional 4 percent.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#80:1> In addition, Massachusetts imposes a convention center financing fee

of 2.75 percent on room occupancy in hotels, motels, or other lodging

establishments in Boston, Cambridge, Springfield, and Worcester.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#81:1> The total tax rate is applied only to the rent received from an

individual who occupies the lodgings for 90 consecutive days or less.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#82:1> Generally, you are responsible for collecting and remitting this tax

if you are an individual or business operating a hotel, motel, lodging house,

or a private club offering sleeping accommodations, and, the relationship

between you and the occupant is not that of landlord and tenant.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#83:1> Establishments must file the appropriate return: Form RO-2CF for

Boston, Cambridge, Springfield and Worcester establishments, and Form RO-2

for all others.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#84:1> Returns are due monthly, 20 days after the end of the following

month, i.e., February 20, for the January filing period, and so on.

which was organized under Chapter 180 of Massachusetts General Laws,

including fraternal organizations, must pay a yearly excise of .57 percent on

the gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#89:1> Any corporation, association, or organization that is subject to the

business corporation excise, or that is a chartered veterans' organization

that maintains quarters for the exclusive use of its members, is not liable

for this excise.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-001#90:1> Gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages are the total

proceeds from the sales of all drinks with an alcoholic nature or content.
<ICE-USA:W2D-001#91:1> Any cost or expense relating to the purchase, storage or sale of

alcoholic beverages may not be deducted from gross receipts.
