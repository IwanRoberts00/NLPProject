<ICE-USA:W2F-004#1:1> <h> " Dwayne Hanson"</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#2:1> <h> CHAPTER ONE</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#3:1> Dwayne Hanson picked a piece of tobacco off his tongue and wiped

it inside the pocket of his black denim duster.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#4:1> He dropped his eighth cigarette and carefully stamped it out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#5:1> He pulled out another unfiltered Lucky, flipped open his hammered

silver lighter and thumbed it on, cupping the flame in his hands so that it

would not be seen by the boy he hunted. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#6:1> He stood on a cushion of needles under a large pine tree.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#7:1> At six feet tall, he was a foot below its lowest limb.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#8:1> The long drooping branches formed a natural tent with a twelve foot

diameter that he had been pacing for the past two hours.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#9:1> Puffing on his cigarette, he walked around the tree again and tipped

his watch so it caught the faint light filtering in from a nearby street

lamp.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#10:1> Almost midnight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#11:1> The damp chill of the early May night was beginning to heighten his

irritation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#12:1> " Too damn cold," he muttered.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#13:1> Maybe it was that hole in the ozone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#14:1> He shook his head - who gives a shit?
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#15:1> Where was that little weasel?
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#16:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#17:1> Being loaned out was really eating at him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#18:1> This waiting in the cold only made it seem worse.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#19:1> Frankie Fallo had given him to some arrogant creep like he was a

loaner car or something- so, of course, the guy treated him just like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#20:1> Go here, watch that one, do this...lucky that Dwayne Hanson was a

professional.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#21:1> Still, it sucked. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#22:1> Three hours ago he had been watching the woman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#23:1> He had been on her for five days.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#24:1> He smirked - he'd like to 'd on her for five days.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#25:1> She was was as hot as she looked.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#26:1> She probably wasn't.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#27:1> How could she be and be hanging with this college punk?
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#28:1> He even had a pansy name - James Elsinor Ryerson, Junior, for

Christ 's sake.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#29:1> Well, the junior part was right, he was in deep shit way over his

girl 's hair head.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#30:1> What could the bitch see in this kid?
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#31:1> Hanson 's thick lips twisted in a grin.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#32:1> Who could figure broads?
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#33:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#34:1> The campus was almost deserted with only an occasional couple

strolling by on the concrete walkway twenty feet from his tree.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#35:1> An hour ago, he had actually waved his arms to see if anyone would

notice him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#36:1> No one seemed to.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#37:1> A good sign in case it got messy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#38:1> He hoped it would - Dwayne Hanson liked it messy. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#39:1> He ground out this butt with the others and was about to twist

another between his lips when he saw someone emerge from behind a large

granite building at the edge of the campus.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#40:1> He pocketed the cigarette, staring through the branches.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#41:1> The figure walked to the narrow drive that divided the campus,

paused, then hurried across.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#42:1> Dwayne Hanson saw that it was a male and, more importantly, it looked

as if he wore his hair in a ponytail.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#43:1> It had to be Ryerson.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#44:1> The boy stopped again by the bookstore, still looking from side to

side.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#45:1> He carried a large manila envelope in his right hand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#46:1> Damn, Hanson thought, the little punk 's got the goods with him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#47:1> Perfect.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#48:1> He could have this all straightened out in an hour. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#49:1> The boy left the bookstore and approached the English building,

appropriately covered with ivy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#50:1> He paused again under a walkway light and Hanson saw the blonde hair,

pulled back tight in a ponytail.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#51:1> Jimmy Ryerson for sure, denim jacket and all, going to see his pal

just as the caller had said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#52:1> The boy continued toward North Hall, a Gothic dorm which reminded

Hanson of something out of an old vampire movie.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#53:1> It stood ten yards beyond his hiding place.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#54:1> Pulling a lead-filled blackjack from his duster pocket, Hanson tapped

it against his leg.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#55:1> One shot behind the ear and the punk'd be a 'drooling mess.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#56:1> Just drag him into the bushes beside that English building and see

what was what.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#57:1> He slid through the branches and moved silently across the lawn,

coming up on Ryerson from behind.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#58:1> Three feet away, he swung the sap back and reached for the dungaree

shoulder.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#59:1> At that instant, the boy glanced back, saw him and leaped away with a

startled cry.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#60:1> Hanson 's hand grabbed air and he almost fell.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#61:1> Rage filled him as he caught his balance and spun around to see Jimmy

Ryerson sprinting back the way he had come.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#62:1> Hanson stuffed the blackjack back in his pocket and went after him.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#63:1> Jimmy Ryerson had run track in high school.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#64:1> Even with five beers in him, he instinctively lengthened his stride

and pulled his rhythmically pumping arms closer to his body.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#65:1> Glancing back, he could see he was pulling away from the curly-headed

man in the flapping duster.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#66:1> It was the same guy who had visited his step-father, no question.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#67:1> He was in bigger trouble than he had planned. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#68:1> Past the bookstore, he saw South Hall, the twin of North, and

angled toward it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#69:1> This guy would have to back off if other people were around.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#70:1> The quickest way into the dorm was through a side door, almost hidden

by flowering Forsythia bushes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#71:1> Ryerson remembered that the flowers were a bright yellow, but they

looked a sickly white in the moonlight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#72:1> He pushed through them, seized the doorknob in his left hand and

pulled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#73:1> The door shuddered, but did not open.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#74:1> The curly-headed man 's footsteps were closer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#75:1> An arc of terror made him fumble and almost drop the manila envelope

as he switched hands. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#76:1> As he grabbed the door in his stronger right hand and pulled it

open, something sharp hit him beneath his right eye.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#77:1> Three inches from his head a piece of wood had been torn out of the

door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#78:1> As he focused on that, a hole popped in the chicken-wire window in

the center of the door. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#79:1> The crazy bastard was shooting at him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#80:1> He dove through the door and down three metal steps that led into

the basement, landing on his knees in the corridor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#81:1> Pain paralyzed him for a moment, but fear stood him up and pushed him

toward the staircase in the center of the building.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#82:1> He knew he wouldn't be safe from this madman, no matter how many

people were here.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#83:1> As he reached the steps, he heard the door behind him slam open and

glass break.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#84:1> The sound propelled him up the stairs and into a collision with four

students entering the front door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#85:1> He pushed through them and was outside, their curses trailing him.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#86:1> Dwayne Hanson 's breath felt like liquid fire and sweat ran freely

down his back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#87:1> The kid was in the building.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#88:1> Some lucky, that punk.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#89:1> Shooting on the run was the only reason he had missed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#90:1> The Ruger twenty-two with its three inch silencer was still in his

right hand as he burst through the basement door, vaguely aware of glass

breaking as he slammed it against the wall.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#91:1> His focus was on the hallway and there, just past the vending

machines, an exit sign.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#92:1> He guessed the kid would be too scared to try to hide down here. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#93:1> As he reached the stairwell, he heard voices echoing in it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#94:1> Ramming the .22 into its holster, he took the steps two at a time.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#95:1> " Slow down, asshole," someone shouted. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#96:1> Four students milled around the front door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#97:1> The one yelling, Hanson 's height with a brushcut, was still leaning

out the door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#98:1> Hanson grabbed him by the belt and propelled him out of the building

and down the two entry steps where he lost his footing and sprawled

face-first onto the sidewalk.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#99:1> Brushcut screamed in pain, then began scrambling to his feet,

swearing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#100:1> Hanson pulled his blackjack from his coat and rapped him with it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#101:1> In mid-curse, Brushcut 's legs folded as he dropped to his knees and

pitched sideways, just making the grass. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#102:1> Ryerson was nowhere in sight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#103:1> Hanson ran to the end of the dorm and stared into a grove of trees

and brush.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#104:1> He knew the punk was in there and that he wasn't going get him

tonight. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#105:1> " Fuck," he said aloud.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#106:1> Now he'd 'dave to call that jerk and explain how he had screwed up.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#107:1> He turned and started back the way he had come. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#108:1> The three college kids were trying to revive their friend when

one of them saw Hanson returning.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#109:1> He whispered to the others and, without a word - or their friend,

they scurried back into the building. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#110:1> Hanson had to grin.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#111:1> College kids were never as smart as they thought they were, but at

least these three were smart enough to know what was good for them. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#112:1> <h> CHAPTER TWO </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#113:1> Nicholas Carmody was six feet tall, dressed in a sleeveless

sweatshirt, stained blue jeans and work boots.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#114:1> A faded red bandanna covered his hair.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#115:1> He held a three foot tapered metal shaft in his gloved hand and

stared at it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#116:1> He tipped the metal so that it glowed in the overhead lights.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#117:1> Close, he thought, but this isn't it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#118:1> He clamped the shaft in a vise on his work bench then removed

his safety goggles to examine it more closely.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#119:1> Absently pulling on his salt and pepper moustache, he walked around

the piece until he nodded to himself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#120:1> Picking up a striker, he lit his acetylene torch, adjusted the flame

then plopped a welding mask on his head and began cutting irregular pieces

out of one edge of the metal. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#121:1> He stopped because even the intentionally random cuts seemed too

planned.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#122:1> Closing his eyes, he moved the torch along the glowing metal.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#123:1> When he opened them, he found he had almost severed the tip, but it

did look better. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#124:1> Carmody turned off the torch and removed his mask.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#125:1> He loosened the blade from the vise enjoying its warmth through his

asbestos glove.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#126:1> He positioned it on a metal anvil, slipped on his goggles and began

molding it with a heavy hammer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#127:1> Cords of muscles stood out on his arms and shoulders.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#128:1> The sound was deafening but he didn't care. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#129:1> As he hit the jagged metal, he experienced an odd mix of

feelings again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#130:1> First, there was a sense of being detached and watching this object

form before his eyes almost as if he weren't shaping it with his blows.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#131:1> But under that was a subtle excitement deep in his body.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#132:1> It had a surge to it that felt as if it were sexual or, at least,

came from a parallel source.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#133:1> It intensified until it seemed to consume him, making him work the

steel faster, but with greater delicacy. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2F-004#134:1> Yeah, he thought, maybe it comes from the sexual part of the

brain.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#135:1> Then he interrupted himself by realizing that he never had these

kinds of thoughts before he started drawing and making sculpture.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#136:1> Sure, he had always thought about women- the way they looked, their

different scents, the incredible smoothness of their skin.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#137:1> But hammering metal and coming up with a connection to sex...well,

that seemed pretty weird.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#138:1> It was definitely new territory for him and, as such, felt strange

and a little embarrassing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#139:1> His grip tightened and he was on it now, making this steel bend to

his will until, paradoxically, it gave him whatever it chose to share.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#140:1> It was ironic that this process seemed sexual to him because it also

reminded him of his recent experiences with women when he had tried to be in

control but always wound up shaking his head, wondering what the hell was

going on.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#141:1> He was grateful that sculpture was easier than people.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#142:1> He was also grateful that he didn't have to share these new

thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#143:1> Sometimes, when he had them, he would imagine what it would be like

to still be a cop and have to tell someone about them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#144:1> Of course, it would always be someone like that idiot, Brennahan, an

overweight, chain-smoking red-neck sergeant who always looked as if he had

just just crawled out of bed after a rough night in his clothes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#145:1> Yeah, Brennahan'd 'de great.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#146:1> Carmody imagined him bellowing, What 's that you say, Carmody?
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#147:1> You got the hots for that metal shit you make?
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#148:1> Man, you gotta have a world-class hard-on to handle that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#149:1> Cops, most of them a little crazy, a lot crude - he didn't miss any

of it, except sometimes...
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#150:1> He stopped and studied the battered, asymmetrical shape.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#151:1> " Better," he said aloud.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#152:1> Carmody turned to the large sculpture that shared the thousand

square foot studio with him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#153:1> It lay tilted on its side.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#154:1> The base, a rough-cut seven foot oak pillar, was braced by thick

blocks of wood anchored to the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#155:1> The top consisted of an almost completed five-foot ball of wood and

metal spikes and was supported by a heavy wooden saw-horse.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#156:1> The hammering of this metal shaft had twisted it enough so that it

would not fit in the slot he had cut for it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#157:1> He reworked it with the hammer until it was straighter, then pushed

it in among the other spikes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#158:1> Pulling off his gloves, he sank into a scarred captain 's chair.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#159:1> He removed the knotted bandanna revealing a full head of silver-gray

hair which had begun to arrive twenty-two years ago when he was nineteen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#160:1> By age twenty-one, it had reached its present state and earned him

the nickname of " Gray" which had followed him throughout his life.
<ICE-USA:W2F-004#161:1> </I>
