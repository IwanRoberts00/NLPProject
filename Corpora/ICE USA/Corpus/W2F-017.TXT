<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#3:1> Dill worked in the produce section of our town 's biggest

supermarket.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#4:1> The store was the centerpiece of the town 's newest strip mall, which

had a bigger parking lot than the combined middle school/high school and

which boasted beige walls made of textured concrete.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#5:1> Even when the snow drifts were piled three cars high, the walls

reminded me of a huge Southwestern adobe hut. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#6:1> I suspected that they looked nothing like adobe.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#7:1> Since I had never been to the Southwest, since all I knew of warm

climates and New Mexico and Arizona were the " genuine Southwestern

hand-tooled leather wear" sold in another strip mall by a couple from

Vermont, plus whatever I had seen on TV, I suspected that I had rather

adjusted my inner vision of the Southwest to match the beige concrete walls

of this strip mall.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#8:1> That way, when I drove out in the middle of a blizzard to buy a can of

black beans, I could tell myself, " I am going to bask in the image of warmer

climes," rather than, " I am going on another useless errand to the grocery

store on the off-chance that I just might catch a glimpse of Dill rearranging

the swiss chard or carting out California oranges." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#9:1> I parked.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#10:1> I entered the supermarket.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#11:1> I sauntered carefully through the aisles, ignoring the young women

with their whining, sticky-faced children, maneuvering aroung the old women

with their permanented thinning hair and their careful steps, occasionally

ducking behind a display of Super Value store-brand Cheetos so that I could

avoid my uncle.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#12:1> He was crazy and lonely, and he haunted the supermarkets and gas

stations just so he would have someone to talk to.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#13:1> Holding my breath and trembling in the centers of my palms, I would

find myself in the produce section, gazing longingly at raddichio or

pondering the philosophical significance of parsnips. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#14:1> Such is the way of obsessions. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#15:1> Dill was the only woman in the store who wasn't a cashier or a

manager.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#16:1> She got her hands dirty; she lugged fifty-pound sacks of potatoes;

she wore a puke-green apron with fruit stains mashed into it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#17:1> She politely ignored everyone who entered the store.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#18:1> She'd wo 'd the same pair of purple Converse for the past year and a

half - - I watched them fade to from bright tropical punch to grayish-brown,

saw every new patch of duct tape appear.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#19:1> I think she might have smiled at me once. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#20:1> She, too, reminded me of warmer climes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#21:1> She had dark hair and dark skin and wore the same denim jacket in

even the coldest weather.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#22:1> Sometimes I felt that if I could only walk up to her and hold my

hands out to her as if she were a furnace, I could be warm forever.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#23:1> I once snuck into the employee 's back room and left her a genuine

Southwestern belt hand-tooled with a garish scene of adobe huts carved into a

cliff face.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#24:1> I debated leaving a note: " I love you, I noticed your old belt is

getting worn, and this made me think of you.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#25:1> But I thought she would not understand how I might equate this ugly

belt with her own warm beauty, and so I left without any comment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#26:1> It was with a sense of triumph over the world that I saw her

begin to wear it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#27:1> The snow started to melt, and I traded my coat, scarf, hat, and

gloves for a grey wool blazer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#28:1> None of my friends knew much about Dill.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#29:1> She had gone to school with us through junior high, and then she went

to the county 's vocational/technical school.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#30:1> Jason 's little brother, who also went to vo/tech, had a few

metal-working classes with her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#31:1> Jeff, who lived in the projects, said she lived a couple buildings

over from him, but he'd 'dever really spoken to her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#32:1> He thought she lived alone. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#33:1> I was accepted to college in California, and school ended.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#34:1> The night after graduation, my friends and I climbed onto the roof of

the school and got drunk.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#35:1> Sean almost fell off the roof while taking a leak; we almost got

arrested </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#36:1> I got a job for the summer in the comic book store just a few

buildings down from Dill 's supermarket. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#37:1> Sometimes we ate lunch at the same time in the same Chinese food

place.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#38:1> I gazed her over my fried rice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#39:1> She, too, ate fried rice, and always a bottle of Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#40:1> Pepper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#41:1> I remember that summer Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#42:1> Pepper was in the middle of a long-running contest in which you could

win prizes written on the inside of the bottle caps, most often a free bottle

of Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#43:1> Pepper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#44:1> A couple times I saw Dill pay for her drink with a bottle cap - - I

think it was the only time I ever saw anyone win anything from a contest.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#45:1> One afternoon I was sitting on the curb to the parking lot,

having finished my fried rice with five minutes left to my lunch half hour.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#46:1> I leaned back on my elbows and watched the sun reflect off the

concrete and car fenders, and I wondered if I might actually see a real

rattlesnake in California.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#47:1> Dill walked past me into the Chinese food joint. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#48:1> A few minutes later she walked out again, swinging a bottle of

Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#49:1> Pepper by her thigh.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#50:1> She sat down next to me, opened it, and took a swig.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#51:1> " You want some?" she asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#52:1> I nodded.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#53:1> She handed it to me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#54:1> I swallowed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#55:1> In private, I had been practicing drinking Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#56:1> Pepper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#57:1> I had never really liked it, since the sweetness clogged up my throat

and made me cough - - I was more of a grapefruit juice kind of person.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#58:1> But I wanted to like Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#59:1> Pepper for thought of Dill.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#60:1> And now the sickly swallows were all worth it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#61:1> I smiled at her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#62:1> She smiled at me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#63:1> I handed the bottle back. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#64:1> We squinted at the cars in the sun; I could almost feel that

warmth emanating from her skin.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#65:1> " I have to go back to work," I told her, " See you around?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#66:1> She nodded, and as I walked the five stores down to my comic book

store, I wondered if she was watching me. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-017#67:1> The night before I left for college, I dreamed of kissing her

goodbye, her skinny hips jutting through the thin denim of her jeans, her

mouth tasting oddly of plums and Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#68:1> Pepper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#69:1> I woke up just before dawn and sat at my desk with a pen and a piece

of notebook paper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#70:1> Finally I wrote, " Thank you for the Dr.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#71:1> Pepper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#72:1> The belt was from me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#73:1> It was seven o'clock.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#74:1> I drove to the supermarket and saw through the window that she was

stocking red delicious apples.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#75:1> I parked and went inside and bought a bottle of Smokey Pete 's Red Hot

Sauce.
<ICE-USA:W2F-017#76:1> Then I snuck into the back room and left the note and the hot sauce

waiting in the pocket of her faded denim jacket. </p> </I>
