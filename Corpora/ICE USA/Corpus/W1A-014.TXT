<ICE-USA:W1A-014#1:1> <h> Professional Issues and Ethics in Counseling Final Exam</h>
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#2:1> <h> 1.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#3:1> How does one develop a personal ethical position or stance, that is,

decide what to do in a particular situation?
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#4:1> What sources of information, guidance, and resources are available to

assist one in this process?
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#5:1> Describe an ethical decision making process; how and when would one

use it? </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#6:1> One develops a personal ethical position by not just consulting

and abiding by a written code of ethics but by considering one 's own values.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#7:1> Because codes of ethics cannot possibly prescribe exactly how

counselors should act in every situation, counselors must rely on their own

sense of personal ethics to help them make sound ethical decisions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#8:1> Certain ethics, called mandatory ethics, comprise the minimal

standards by which counselors should abide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#9:1> Principle ethics help one decide what to do in certain situations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#10:1> Principle ethics are based on moral principles and should always be

considered when making ethical decisions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#11:1> They are based on Kitchener 's five moral principles that are

generally valued in our society: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence,

justice, and fidelity ( Herlihy & Corey, 2006).
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#12:1> All counselors should abide by the moral principles that all clients

have the right to make their own decisions, counselors should never harm

their clients, counselors should promote growth and good mental health in

their clients, counselors should treat all clients with fairness, and

counselors should always abide by their promises and honor the commitments

they make to their clients.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#13:1> Beyond principle ethics, by which all counselors should abide,

counselors can hold even higher personal ethical standards for themselves.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#14:1> Called virtue ethics, these ethics focus on who the counselor is as a

person.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#15:1> One develops virtue ethics by asking, " Who am I as a person and

counselor?" and by examining one 's personal character traits and virtues.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#16:1> Counselors who aspire to always consider virtue ethics when making

ethical decisions utilize principle ethics as well as consider their own

emotions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#17:1> This involves self-awareness and self-reflection.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#18:1> Virtue ethics include: discernment or prudence, respectfulness,

integrity, self-awareness, acknowledgement of the role of emotion, and

connectedness with the community.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#19:1> Aspiring to abide by the very highest standards of ethical conduct by

utilizing these virtue ethics helps counselors make more culturally sensitive

ethical decisions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#20:1> When faced with a complex ethical dilemma, counselors can use virtue

ethics to help them decide the best course of action.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#21:1> Counselors should consult a code of ethics to help them make

sound ethical decisions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#22:1> Counselors can use the American Counseling Association 's ( ACA) Code

of Ethics ( 2005) as well as the code of ethics in their specialty, if one

exists.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#23:1> Professional school counselors should consult both the ACA Code of

Ethics and the American School Counselor Association 's ( ASCA) Ethical

Standards for School Counselors ( 2004).
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#24:1> These are both based on Kitchener 's moral principles, but the ASCA 's

code addresses ethical standards specific to the school setting and should be

used for handling ethical dilemmas in this realm.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#25:1> Codes of ethics provide guidelines for best practices, promote the

values held by the members of the counseling profession, and are used for

accountability purposes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#26:1> These codes of ethics detail the ethical responsibilities counselors

have to their clients, students, colleagues, and themselves.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#27:1> Professional school counselors should also consult with

supervisors and colleagues when faced with an ethical dilemma.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#28:1> They do this to find out the current standards of practice so that

they can make decisions consistent with these standards.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#29:1> When counselor have an ethical dilemma, it is important that they

consult with supervisors and colleagues in addition to consulting the

appropriate code of ethics for guidance.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#30:1> They should document all of these actions in order to protect and

defend themselves, should they be sued by clients.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#31:1> Professional school counseling can also contact the ACA Ethics

and Professional Standards Department if they have an ethical dilemma.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#32:1> Staff in this department offer free consultation related to ethical

dilemmas five days a week.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#33:1> This is a valuable resource for professional school counselors,

especially if they are in need of immediate guidance and support and cannot

reach their county 's school counseling supervisor.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#34:1> Counselors should also use an ethical decision-making model when

faced with a complex ethical dilemma in which they are unsure of how to act.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#35:1> There are several ethical decision-making models available to help

counselors when faced with complex situations in which there are no clear

guidelines regarding how to respond.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#36:1> Both ACA and ASCA have developed ethical decision-making models, and

other self-test models can be used as well.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#37:1> These models help counselors identify the problem and work through

several steps to help decide how to respond.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#38:1> Following an ethical decision-making model helps counselors make

reasoned, informed decisions rather than acting hastily or irresponsibly in

the absence of set standards regarding how to act in certain situations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#39:1> This process involves reflection and consultation, and the steps

should be documented for accountability purposes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#40:1> In their book, the ACA Ethical Standards Casebook ( 2006),

Herlihy and Corey recommend following ten steps to making ethical decisions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#41:1> Step one involves identifying the problem and collecting information.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#42:1> Steps two and three involve consulting the relevant and appropriate

code of ethics and considering which of Kitchener 's five moral principles

apply to the situation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#43:1> Step four is to consult with one 's supervisor and colleagues to help

determine the standard of practice for this situation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#44:1> Step five is to consider one 's own emotions because these may impede

one 's current judgment and ability to make decisions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#45:1> Step six is to involve the client in making the decision so that he

can offer his input and wishes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#46:1> Steps seven and eight involve identifying desired outcomes and

considering all of one 's options and the consequences and implications of

each.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#47:1> Once one determines which action one will take, step nine urges one

to review the selected action and apply the tests of justice, publicity, and

universality to it.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#48:1> If it does not cause any new ethical issues, one should move to step

ten and implement the decided upon action.</p> <.h>
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#49:1> 2.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#50:1> Discuss the specific ethical and legal issues concerning counseling

minors in school settings.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#51:1> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#52:1> Because the clients are minors, there are several ethical and

legal issues surrounding counseling students in a school setting.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#53:1> According to ASCA 's Ethical Standards for School Counselors ( 2004),

the professional school counselor 's primary obligation is to the student,

although complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#54:1> When counseling minors in a school setting, confidentiality can and

should be breached if a student indicates plans to hurt him/herself or

others, if a student reports abuse or if the counselor suspects the child is

being abused or neglected, and if the counselor 's records are subpoenaed by a

court ( the professional school counselor is forced to comply if she also

receives a court order).
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#55:1> In these cases, the professional school counselor has to break

confidentiality, but he should communicate and discuss this with the student

beforehand.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#56:1> According to section B.2.a. of the ACA Code of Ethics ( 2005), the

counselor can break confidentiality to disclose information in order to

protect the client.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#57:1> The professional school counselor should make every effort to include

the student and family ( except in cases of abuse) in decision making.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#58:1> Professional school counselors have to follow several laws when

working with minors in a school system.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#59:1> Based on the Tarasoff case of 1974, the counselor has a " duty to

warn" when she suspects that someone is in danger of being harmed ( Linde,

2007).
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#60:1> In many states, this is now both an ethical and legal duty.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#61:1> In the case of HIV/AIDS, however, professional school counselors in

Maryland do not have a right to know if students are infected and have a

legal duty not to share this information with others.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#62:1> The decision of Eisel v.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#63:1> Board of Education of Montgomery County in 1991 now requires

professional school counselors to call students' legal guardians and inform

school administrators if they suspect or learn directly from a student that

the student is considering committing suicide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#64:1> All school personnel also have a legal duty to report suspected abuse

or neglect.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#65:1> If a counselor finds out that a student has committed an illegal act

or run away from home, the counselor has a legal right to notify the

administration in the former case, and the parent or guardian in the latter

case ( unless abuse is suspected).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#66:1> Professional school counselors must also be aware of and uphold

minor consent laws, which vary from state to state.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#67:1> In many states, students seeking treatment for substance abuse,

contraception, prenatal care, and treatment for sexually transmitted

infections can do so without parental knowledge or consent.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#68:1> Abortion laws pertaining to minors vary widely from state to state.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#69:1> School counselors have a legal obligation to follow not only state

laws but also local and school policies when working with minors, so they

need to be aware of these.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#70:1> In all schools that receive funding from the U.S. Department of

Education, student records must be kept in accordance with the Family

Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 ( Buckley Amendment).
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#71:1> School counselors must abide by this law and cannot share any part of

a student 's school record ( information pertaining to grades, attendance,

assessments, behavior, health records) with a non-legal guardian (

non-custodial parents have rights unless these have been terminated by a

court), and should not access students' records themselves unless they are

directly working with those students.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#72:1> Personal notes about minors are not part of the school record and

should be in a private, secure location.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#73:1> Professional school counselors should also respect the rights and

wishes of parents and legal guardians and should try to collaborate with them

when possible.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#74:1> Because parents and legal guardians have a legal right to know what

the professional school counselor discusses with minor students, the

professional school counselor should explain the importance of

confidentiality and trust with the guardians, according to section B.5.b. of

the ACA Code of Ethics ( 2005).
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#75:1> If legal guardians request more information related to their child 's

counseling, professional school counselors may disclose minimal information

or set up a meeting among the student, parent, and themselves to discuss the

counseling relationship.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#76:1> If this still does not satisfy the guardians and the student refuses

to share this information with them, the counselor will have to break

confidentiality to tell the parents information shared during counseling.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#77:1> Although minors have an ethical right to confidentially in

counseling, their legal guardians have legal rights to know what occurs in

counseling, unless the child has been legally emancipated.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#78:1> If I were a professional school counselor and a student came in

and told me this, the first step I would take would be to conduct a lethality

assessment to see if she has devised a suicide plan.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#79:1> I would ask questions such as, " How long have you been thinking

about this?," " Do you have a plan?," " Have you thought about how you would

do it?," and " Have you thought about when you would do it?" to assess the

immediacy of the risk.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#80:1> I would take our conversation very seriously because her comments

indicate that she is depressed, has developed an eating disorder, has low

self-esteem, cuts herself, and has been doing poorly academically.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#81:1> These are all serious warning signs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#82:1> I would encourage her to explore her feelings and might ask her to

complete a " Life Contract," in which she will promise not to harm herself

for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-014#83:1> I would explain that I have to tell her parents in order to

protect her.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#84:1> Section A.2.a. of ASCA 's Ethical Standards for School Counselors

explains, among other responsibilities when beginning a relationship, the

ethical duty to discuss confidentiality and its limits to clients ( 2004).
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#85:1> Even if she said her parents already knew about her suicidal

thoughts, I would tell her that I have a duty to warn them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#86:1> Following section A.7.b. of the Ethical Standards for School

Counselors, I would offer the student the opportunity to tell her parents

with me and would try to accommodate her wishes regarding how we tell her

parents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#87:1> By law, I would have a " duty to warn" her parents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#88:1> The ruling of the Eisel case resulted in a Maryland law regarding

professional school counselors' duty to warn parents if they have any reason

to suspect that their child is suicidal.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#89:1> In this case, I have heard it directly from the student herself, and

her comments must be taken very seriously.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#90:1> I would follow my district 's procedures for handling potential

suicide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#91:1> I would call her parents and strongly urge them to take her to the

hospital or to a psychiatrist for a psychiatric evaluation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-014#92:1> Depending on the seriousness and imminence of the threat, which I

would gauge by further conversation with the student, I might ask that a

parent come and pick her up immediately. </p> </I>
