<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#1:1> Thupstan is twelve years old.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#2:1> He has a mother, father, sister, and brother, but he hasn't lived with

them for six years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#3:1> Thupstan doesn't play ball.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#4:1> In fact, he doesn't play sports at all.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#5:1> Thupstan doesn't own any pants.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#6:1> He 's not allowed to wear them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#7:1> Thupstan doesn't eat meat.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#8:1> Most of the time, he 's not even allowed to eat dinner.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#9:1> Thupstan doesn't watch TV, listen to music, go shopping, grow his

hair long, or talk with many girls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#10:1> Thupstan is a Buddhist monk.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#11:1> There are nineteen Thupstans living at Rizong monastery in Ladakh, a

remote Himalayan region in northern India.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#12:1> Ranging in age from five to fourteen, they all take their name from

Khan Rimpoche Gyalsras Thupstan Nima Langstochs Stanzing Nerbu, the head

monk, who is the living reincarnation of the monastery 's founder.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#13:1> Rizong is one of more than 100 monasteries that dot this arid,

high-altitude plateau.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#14:1> Thupstan is one of the hundreds of boys who live within them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#15:1> In many ways, Thupstan is the embodiment of all that is Ladakhi

society today.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#16:1> His simple, isolated lifestyle reflects a traditional culture and

value system that are markedly different from those being carried into Ladakh

from the outside world today.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#17:1> Moreover, like the larger society his monastery is a part of,

Thupstan will soon be forced to shed his isolation and come to terms with the

outside world.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#18:1> The choices he will be forced to make parallel those facing Ladakhi

society at large.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#19:1> For centuries, Buddhism has been the dominant force shaping

Ladakhi life and ways of thought.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#20:1> Traditionally, Buddhist monasteries were the cultural, educational,

and spiritual centers of the greater community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#21:1> Monks were preachers and teachers, presiding and offering their

services at all important occasions of family and social life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#22:1> Devoutly practicing the faith and turning to their Buddhist clergy

for guidance and advice regarding this life and the next, people reserved

their highest respect for those dedicated to the search for spiritual

enlightenment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#23:1> Until quite recently, at least one member of every Buddhist family

lived and worked at a monastery.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#24:1> Sending a son into monastic service was thought to accrue karmic

merit for the family - according to Buddhist doctrine, the equivalent of

giving eyes to 100 blind men.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#25:1> These beliefs are still widely held, as evidenced by the presence of

Thupstan and his fellow novices at Rizong Monastery.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#26:1> The approach to Rizong is a difficult one.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#27:1> The monastery is situated in an isolated valley, five kilometers walk

from the nearest road.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#28:1> The English translation of Rizong is " mountain fort." The Ladakhi

word for monastery, <it> gompa </it> , means " solitary place." Both words

aptly describe its setting.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#29:1> Founded only 170 years ago, it is not one of Ladakh 's oldest

monasteries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#30:1> Rizong, however, is a reformed monastery of the Ge-Lug-Pa ( Model of

Virtue) sect, and its monks maintain strict adherence to the 253 rules of

monastic life, which govern everything from their hairstyles to their sex

lives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#31:1> So as to detach themselves from worldly desires, which beget

ignorance and hinder an individual 's efforts to attain enlightenment, the

monks lead a minimal life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#32:1> They are often found in group or solitary meditation, attempting to

attain the attributes of their deities and a state of enlightenment, which

leads to nirvana - union with the cosmic whole - or Buddhahood.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#33:1> The lives of the novices are much less regimented than those of

their older role models; however, theirs too are lives of strict routine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#34:1> Thupstan, who joined the monastery at five, climbs out of the

novices' communal dormitory at 4:3O a.m.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#35:1> every morning.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#36:1> The other novices and a rough woolen blanket are all he has to

protect himself from winter temperatures as low as - 30 degrees centigrade.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#37:1> Shoving his feet into a pair of ragged canvas tennis shoes, he pads

off through a labyrinth of passageways to the kitchen.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#38:1> En route he collects a load of wood to stoke the morning fire.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#39:1> Once in the kitchen, he joins three of the older novices, who attend

to the preparation of the morning meal when not amusing themselves by hitting

each other with sticks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#40:1> An advanced monk serves as the manager of the monastery 's mundane

affairs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#41:1> Nineteen junior monks are largely responsible for the monastery 's

day-to-day operation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#42:1> They cook, clean, gather firewood, gaze animals, carry water, and

serve the temporal needs of the elder monks.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#43:1> The kitchen is the focal point of the novices' regimen.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#44:1> The room is dark and smoky, dominated by a large mud-brick oven.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#45:1> The low rafters and walls are covered with soot and lined with butter

churns, tea cisterns, and huge brass pots.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#46:1> With practiced efficiency the novices knead dough, stoke the fire,

and stir a cauldron, which bubbles on the stove.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#47:1> The menu never varies: a brackish soup of barley noodles and turnip

greens for breakfast and a hardened ball of parched barley flour dipped in

buttermilk for lunch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#48:1> Both meals are washed down with salted butter tea.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#49:1> These are the daily staples of the Ladakhi and Tibetan diet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#50:1> According to Rizong 's rule, no one is allowed dinner, but the rule is

bent for the youngest of the novices.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#51:1> The other novices gradually appear for breakfast, huddling around

the stove for warmth and using twigs to help slurp the hot soup into their

mouths from wooden bowls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#52:1> Most have several bowlfuls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#53:1> After breakfast they move off to attend to their morning chores.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#54:1> A few stay behind to complete the half-hearted cleanup that is

typical of young boys everywhere.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#55:1> Nothing in the monastery is ever really clean, particularly the monks

themselves.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#56:1> The boys present a curious picture, caring for themselves and

their home at an age when most boys are still being coddled by their parents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#57:1> No one insists that they wash behind their ears, and they don't; the

dirt clings to their saffron robes and bodies in layers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#58:1> They go home rarely, if ever.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#59:1> When asked if they miss their families, the chorus of earnest " No 's"

is convincing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#60:1> A visit by one of the boy 's fathers belies their protestations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#61:1> The unscheduled reunion is at first rather formal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#62:1> After more than a year 's separation, the father and his

fourteen-year-old son sit down to tea and make stilted conversation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#63:1> The boy 's excitement is obvious, but he seems confused about how to

treat his father, alternating between calculated formality and sheepish

grins.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#64:1> Eventually, his determination to maintain formality dissolves, and he

allows himself to show the enthusiasm that he feels, proudly showing off his

new home and position.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#65:1> The other novices pay close attention, and at the lunch time meal,

they cling to the stranger, as if hoping to draw some familial warmth from

him.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#66:1> The reunion is brief and the atmosphere soon returns to normal, but

it is a poignant reminder of the isolation of these young men.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#67:1> Few boys choose to come to a monastery themselves, but they are

all aware that their presence there has a purpose.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#68:1> This purpose is evident in every facet of their lives, but is never

forced upon them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#69:1> The novices spend little time studying Buddhist doctrine and play

little active role in the monk 's daily prayer sessions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#70:1> Buddhism seeks to guide the individual to enlightenment through

meditation and the development of inner consciousness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#71:1> It does not demand obedience to an authoritarian god, and likewise,

little is demanded of the novices, save their adherence to their monastic

chores and school work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#72:1> Days melt into months and months into years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#73:1> The austerity and isolation of the monastic setting instill a sense

of timelessness and separation from the outside world.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#74:1> Presumably, this will help the novices discover the path to

enlightenment on their own.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#75:1> After breakfast, Thupstan takes the monastery 's cattle out to

graze.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#76:1> Their bodies dwarf his small frame, but he is accustomed to the task

and herds them deftly with a stick and a few well aimed rocks, singing all

the while and hopping between rocks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#77:1> He is a curious and intelligent boy, with a strong sense of his

station in life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#78:1> Above all, he wants to grow up and be a good monk.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#79:1> His reasoning is simple.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#80:1> " Here we don't have to worry about getting married or working," he

says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#81:1> " We can study and learn languages."
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#82:1> Monastic schools still provide some of the best primary education in

Ladakh.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#83:1> The bulk of a novice 's daily schedule is absorbed by school.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#84:1> The schoolhouse is ramshackle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#85:1> Like the novices' one- room communal dwelling, it is located at the

lower end of the monastery 's grounds, symbolizing their lowly status in the

monastic hierarchy and the intellectual distance they must travel in order to

attain enlightenment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#86:1> Every morning except Sunday, two blackboards are wheeled out, and

after a few prayers and the singing of the Indian national anthem, classes

get under way.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#87:1> The atmosphere is not unlike that of a village schoolhouse, with a

scholarly monk dividing his time between two classes and the novices taking

turns to direct the singsong recitation of the sentences he writes on the

blackboard.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#88:1> The subject material contains fragments of Buddhist philosophy, but

also includes exercises in stilted English ( " Is the gun big?" " Is this

Mary 's bicycle?").
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#89:1> The students earnestly copy their lessons into tattered notebooks

using pencil stubs sharpened on rocks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#90:1> One of the novices occasionally runs out to chase down an errant cow,

an event that might lead to general chaos in another school but hardly

elicits a sidelong glance here.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#91:1> The novices apply themselves with a seriousness that belies their

age.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#92:1> This seriousness dissolves immediately as the boys dart out of

the school-yard at the end of the day.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#93:1> They throw rocks, taunt and tease the elder monks, or simply lie in a

field and daydream.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#94:1> When asked what they would like to do when they grow up, the response

is predictable " I want to be a monk."
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#95:1> They don't act like it when they're at 'reay, and it would probably be

safe to say that it 's not the subject of most of their daydreams.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#96:1> Like most boys, they hate doing nothing, and the lack of distractions

at Rizong may be the reason why so much of their energy is channeled into

school.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#97:1> The monastic schools of Ladakh have recently introduced a

standardized curriculum.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#98:1> In addition to math, today 's novices learn to read and write in

Tibetan, Urdu, Hindi, and English.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#99:1> They will need all four languages to understand the Buddhist

scriptures, their fellow Ladakhis, Indians, and the world at large.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#100:1> The new curriculum is both a response to Ladakh 's isolation from

Chinese-occupied Tibet, to which it used to send its novices for higher

education, and a tacit admission that Ladakh is no longer isolated from the

outside world.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#101:1> Remote as Ladakh is, it is experiencing a growing tourist

industry and a steadily expanding presence of Indian soldiers and merchants.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#102:1> The tourists come to enjoy Ladakh 's rich cultural heritage, the

soldiers defend India from Pakistan and China, and the merchants are

developing a nascent commercial market.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#103:1> With their invasion of material prosperity and technological

progress the tourists and Indians represent a threat to the austerity and

isolation of traditional Ladakhi life and monastic service, which no longer

hold their universal attraction.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#104:1> As one young Ladakhi puts it, " To become a monk, you have to give

up all the good things in life."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#105:1> Thupstan is conscious and curious about the outside world, but

largely ignorant of the choices he will soon be forced to make.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#106:1> Flipping through a copy of a western magazine, he points to an

advertisement and says, " This one good."
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#107:1> His worldly desires have been raised to a

&dollar;6,000 Rolex watch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#108:1> Shortly thereafter, he spots a picture of a scantily clad woman,

giggles, and runs his finger over the glossy page.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#109:1> Given the chance to go where he would like, he immediately answers,

" America."
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#110:1> Why?
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#111:1> " For the pleasure," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#112:1> While he may never get the chance to go to America, he will almost

certainly go to Choglamsar, which in its way may prove just as

impressive.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#113:1> Choglamsar, a dusty collection of mud shacks and Tibetan refugee

settlements eight kilometers outside Ladakh 's capital city of Leh, is the

site of the Central Institute for Buddhist Studies ( CIBS).
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#114:1> Established in 1959 as a higher education center for Ladakhi novices

who could no longer enter a conquered Tibet, the center is today a sprawling

complex serving 35O students.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#115:1> It is funded by the Indian government - meaning that CIBS cannot

discriminate on the basis of age, sex, race, or religious belief.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#116:1> As a result, 85 percent of its students are lay people, who are

drawn by the institute 's ability to offer 150 rupee (

&dollar;6) per month scholarships and its reputation as a school dedicated to the

preservation of Ladakhi culture.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-011#117:1> While this mission is both admirable and necessary, the reality

for novices in attendance there is another matter.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#118:1> In a matter of hours, they are transported from the isolation of the

monastery into a world of sunglasses, hightop tennis shoes, modish

hairstyles, music, and girls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#119:1> The modern Lakakhi youth is a slick operator, and, for novices, the

contrast here could not be more striking.
<ICE-USA:W2B-011#120:1> They adapt quickly to this new world, and while they are not allowed

to discard their monastic robes, it is not uncommon to see a novice sporting

a pair of Ray Bans and hightops and striking a cool pose while hanging out

between lectures.</p> </I>
