<ICE-USA:W1B-023#4:1> <h> Re: The attached letter to the Faculty Council Review

Committee</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#5:1> I write in the sincere hope that you will be able to conduct a

full, fair, impartial, and open review of Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's

performance.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#6:1> The enclosed letter, which I will send to the Faculty Council Review

Committee as soon as its membership is constituted, does not retrace " A

Questionable Leadership: The Need for Change at UMB"(December 8, 1992) with

which you and your staff are already familiar.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#7:1> Instead, it draws upon my experience as a member of departmental and

intercollegiate committees and of the CAS Senate so as to describe six

further instances of Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's mismanagement: ( 1)

subversion of the English Ph.D., the planning of which she and her second

Acting Provost had encouraged; ( 2) faulty charge and subsequent dismissal of

the Intercollegiate Committee on Undergraduate Teacher Certification and

resulting waste of the committee 's and related dpartments' efforts; ( 3)

punishment of independent thinking and reward of servility as evidenced in

the appointment of the CAS Acting Dean in August, 1992; ( 4) coercion of CAS

faculty and governance in college restructuring, wherein the Provost in

effect becomes dean; ( 5) weak protection of faculty from anti-semitism and

sexism; ( 6) through claims that faculty are ignorant of budget constraints

and guilty of gender bias, self-deceptive resistance to constructive

criticism. Because these instances of mismanagement reflect the Chancellor 's

administrative character, they cannot be repaired with simple or quick

efforts.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#8:1> I know it is difficult for you to face the prospect of letting go the

top female administrator in the university, but I believe you must do so.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#9:1> Thank you very much for reading my letter, which I am FAXing to your

office today.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#16:1> Dear Colleagues:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#17:1> No one is wrong all of the time.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#18:1> Chancellor <@> Price</@> deserves praise for strengthening curricular

and enrollment diversity and for initiating efforts at fund-raising in the

private sector.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#19:1> But her persistent confusion of power with genuine strength has more

often damaged the University.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#20:1> Instead of negotiating, she has willfully disregarded the advice she

asked faculty to provide and advice governance legitimately provided.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#21:1> My letter will not repeat evidence of Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's

mismanagement already made familiar in " A Questionable Leadership: The Need

for Change at UMB" ( December 8, 1992).
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#22:1> Instead, I will limit it to describing six further instances of

mismanagement which prevented the University from benefiting from the work of

departmental and intercollegiate committees and the CAS Senate on which I

served</p>.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#23:1> Subversion of the English Ph.D. in Language, Writing, and

Culture: At the request of the campus administration, the English Department

agreed to design a Ph.D. program.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#24:1> For several years, I served on the English Ph.D. Planning Committee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#25:1> After extensive work, both on campus and among campuses in the

northeast, the full proposal for a Ph.D. in Language, Writing, and Culture

was presented at the June, 1991, BOT meeting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#26:1> Enthusiasm for the proposal seemed to portend timely formal approval.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#27:1> Yet Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's actions have kept approval out of

reach.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#28:1> On September 6, 1991, she asked that the proposal be put on the BOT

agenda for October, 1991.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#29:1> But later she replaced it with new agenda items ( her proposals for a

College of Science and in Engineering).
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#30:1> Then she initiated a two-track Ed.D. program, one not supported by

existing faculty resources and therefore entailing great additional expense.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#31:1> A year later on November 4, 1992, Provost <@> Sellers</@> invited the

Ph.D. Committee to meet with him, reassuring us that even though the proposal

had been accidentally omitted from the BOT agenda for 1992, he would obtain

Stage 2 approval very soon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#32:1> Since December 8, 1992, when the Chair of the English Department (

who as a member of the " Futures" committee had criticized Chancellor <@>

Price</@>) and a majority of the Ph.D. planning committee signed " A

Questionable Leadership," silence has deepened.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#33:1> Last fall the Chair of the English Department was informed that the

proposal remains at Stage 1 for the third year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#34:1> Meanwhile, even though our proposal has received both external and

internal praise, and neither Chancellor <@> Price</@> nor Provost <@>

Sellers</@> has raised substantive questions or justified the delays , the

Ed.D. program-- planned after ours and costing far more-- is up and

running.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#35:1> For Chancellor <@> Price</@> to encourage faculty to devote the

vast amount of energy and time needed to design an excellent and innovative

doctoral program like ours, to promise but continually withhold support, and

thereby to subvert the program she had outwardly fostered demonstrates one

instance of managerial wastefulness if and vengeful abuse of her power.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#36:1> Wasted Efforts of the Intercollegiate Committee on Undergraduate

Teacher: This wild goose chase, in which I participated as a committee member

for the second of its two years' deliberations, resembles the story of the

English Ph.D.: ask the faculty to plan, praise the results, then dismiss the

plans.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#37:1> " A Questionable Leadership" tells the story of Acting Provost <@>

Amin</@> 's giving one charge and Acting Provost <@> Sellers</@> 's disbanding

the committee for failing to do something else.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#38:1> I will not repeat this story of administrative carelessness that

caused some twenty committee members to waste two years' service.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#39:1> But I will add a further dimension.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#40:1> Departments like English, which were asked to contribute substantial

numbers of courses to the proposed TCP, to modify existing courses, and

perhaps to recruit faculty with expertise in English and Language Arts

education-- spent agonizing months trying to figure out where the resources

might come from: how could English both serve a program it recognized as

immensely significant both to the University and to the community, maintain

its commitments to Freshman English, the Core, and interdisciplinary

teaching, and not sacrifice the English major?
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#41:1> English was by no means the only department affected; indeed, any

department engaging in secondary certification had to grapple with these

questions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#42:1> To waste the committee members' energies was bad enough, but the CUTP

fiasco was multiplied throughout CAS, CPCS, and GCE.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#43:1> Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's two Acting Provosts were, respectively,

careless in charging the committee and thankless in disbanding it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#44:1> They made the waste of our energies and those of departments all the

more burdensome.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#45:1> <h> The Appointment of CAS Acting Dean <@> Esperanto</@> in August,

1992</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#46:1> The wastefulness and injustice of Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's

appointment of <@> Larry Esperanto</@> as Acting Dean of CAS are as widely

recognized as the procedural chicanery employed to effect it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#47:1> Again, there is no need to retrace the story here in detail.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#48:1> What I want to add here is simply this: Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's

two choices of action demonstrated once again her confusion of power with

strength.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#49:1> First, she failed to appoint then Associate Dean <@> Edith

Plaman</@>, who over twelve years had earned the overwhelming respect and

support of the CAS faculty, and who as Acting Dean had defused a crisis over

the Writing Proficiency Exam with her customary fairness, graciousness, and

realistic wisdom-- and without needing to accept the Chancellor 's offer of

University security.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#50:1> The failure to appoint this candidate as Acting Dean in 1992 taught

CAS faculty not to expect the Chancellor to reward strength, competence, and

independence.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#51:1> Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's second choice of action taught that

servility would be rewarded.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#52:1> Acting Dean <@> Esperanto</@> freely, publicly, and repeatedly

acknowledges that he was appointed on the condition that he deliver to

Chancellor <@> Price</@> the restructuring of CAS.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#53:1> <@> Esperanto</@>, but not <@> Plaman</@>, was willing to override

both widespread opposition within CAS and repeated advice from Chancellor <@>

Price</@> 's blue-ribbon " Futures" Committee-- the Task Force on Natural and

Information Sciences) not to split the College.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#54:1> Having already dismissed such opposition and such advice, Chancellor

<@> Price</@> simply wanted an Acting Dean of CAS who would obey her.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#55:1> I served on the CAS Budget and Long Range Planning Committee under

Acting Dean <@> Esperanto</@> in 1992-93.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#56:1> He gave the committee no charge and no guidance beyond an hour-long

sketch of resource allocation issues at institutions comparable to UMB.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#57:1> He was simply awaiting direction from the Chancellor 's planning

committee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#58:1> Another waste.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#59:1> The Faculty Council committee will already be familiar with the

protracted deliberations of the " Futures" and " Back to the Futures"

committees mentioned in ( 3) above.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#60:1> But I must now go into rather deep detail in order to describe

Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's persistent refusal to address governance 's

objections to restructuring CAS.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#61:1> The point of what follows is simple: Chancellor <@> Price</@>

could have read " A Questionable Leadership" in December, 1992, and chosen to

mend her managerial style so as to make it more genuinely collaborative.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#62:1> Chancellor <@> Price</@>, through Provost <@> Sellers</@>, did just

the opposite: used her power to coerce change.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#63:1> As a member of the CAS Senate from September, 1992 through

December, 1993, I witnessed Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's and Acting Provost <@>

Sellers</@> 's continuing refusal to address CAS 's objections to the <@>

Esperanto</@> plan ( " Administrative Structure and the Administrative

Responsibilities in the College of Arts and Sciences," December 11, 1992).
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#64:1> By giving line authority to both the Science Dean and the Liberal

Arts Dean, both of whom would report directly to the Provost, this plan in

effect made the Provost into the CAS Dean.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#65:1> Noting many problems with this plan, the CAS Senate approved a

detailed rationale and the following motion: " It is the sense of the Senate

that the responsibilities of the Dean of Science Faculty can be and, in fact,

have been adequately carried out without line authority over buget and

personnel.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#66:1> The Senate therefore urges Acting Dean <@> Esperanto</@> to propose

alternative administrative arrangements in consultation with department

chairs, program directors, appropriate faculty and professional staff" ( see

Senate minutes for March 1, 1993, for both the rationale and the motion).
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#67:1> Between March 2nd and March 10th, the CAS Senate conducted a

referendum on the <@> Esperanto</@> plan; 72&percent; of all respondents disapproved

of the plan ( 88&percent; in Arts &Humanities, 95&percent; in Social Sciences, and 33&percent; in

Natural Sciences disapproved it).
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#68:1> Astonishingly, Acting Dean <@> Esperanto</@> 's letter of transmittal

on March 29, 1993, not only dismissed the referendum but also inaccurately

claimed that opponents of his plan all favored the 1991 single-dean model (

see Senate minutes of April 12, 1993, and letter from Senate Moderator <@>

Johan</@> to President <@> Hoover</@> , April 14, 1993).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#69:1> Provost <@> Sellers</@> refused the CAS Senate Executive

Committee 's attempts to present alternatives to Acting Dean <@>

Esperanto</@> 's lop-sided and costly plan, and he insisted that line

authority must be given to the Science Dean ( see Senate minutes of May 12,

1993).
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#70:1> Realizing that Provost <@> Sellers</@> intended to implement the <@>

Esperanto</@> plan for accomplishing Chancellor <@> Price</@> 's wishes, the

Senate had no choice but to participate in yet another committee, the Ad Hoc

Committee on CAS Administrative Structure, working during the summer of 1993

( the Senate 's motion passed by unanimous voice vote on June 16, 1993, makes

clear the coercion it felt: " ...the Senate feels compelled to participate in

this planning.").
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#71:1> The report of that Ad Hoc Committee ( September 7, 1993) very clearly

spelled out its continuing reservations about the three-dean model it was

proposing as merely the lesser of evils.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#72:1> In response, the CAS Senate concurred with the Ad Hoc Committee 's

critique of the three-dean model yet, again as a realistic response to

coercion by Provost <@> Sellers</@>, settled for the deeply flawed model so

that dean searches could begin ( see CAS Senate minutes for September 27,

1993).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#73:1> The pattern is clear.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#74:1> Chancellor <@> Price</@> and Provost <@> Sellers</@> do have the

power to enforce their wishes over the protests of faculty and governance.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#75:1> And they exercise it, calling it " strong management." To do this is

to confuse genuine strength, which dares to negotiate and collaborate so that

a community can be preserved, with tyranny.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#76:1> <h> Weak Protection of Faculty from Students' Anti-Semitism and

Sexism?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#77:1> Chancellor <@> Price</@> rightly prides herself on her commitment

to diversity in the curriculum and in enrollment, but that commitment has

badly faltered when faculty members have become victims of students' attacks.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#78:1> Students and faculty deserve equally vigorous protection from

harassment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-023#79:1> On May 12, 1993, the Faculty Council heard a disturbing report of

anti-semitic attacks on <@> Dan Beaker</@>, my CPCS colleague in composition.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#80:1> Prof. <@> Beaker</@> 's letter detailed complaints of a disgruntled

students repeated anti-semitic letters and physical threats.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#81:1> He had promptly reported these verbal attacks, but VC Charles Desmond

had repeatedly ignored them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#82:1> For a disturbed student to express anti-semitism is one thing, for

the university senior administration to appear to condone it through inaction

is quite another.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#83:1> Amazingly, Chancellor <@> Price</@> defended her VC 's inaction.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#84:1> The Faculty Council passed a motion expressing its dismay with the

mishandling of Prof. <@> Beaker</@> 's situation and demanding periodic

reports of the administration 's subsequent responses to it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#85:1> Very soon after that, an English professor suffered sexual

harrassment from a student.
<ICE-USA:W1B-023#86:1> This woman, a brand-new untenured faculty member in English ( who

nevertheless has substantial experience teaching at urban universities in

Chicago and Miami), received a letter describing various sexual intentions,

including the explicit threat, " I will have you."</p> </I>
