<ICE-USA:W2C-010#1:1> <h> Surprise rejection of Tampa Bay offer moves him to top of Wolf 's

list </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#2:1> Green Bay, Wis. - - If Bill Parcells wants to return to coaching -

- and there are strong indications that he does-he could be named coach of

the Green Bay Packers as early as Tuesday.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#3:1> General manager Ron Wolf said Sunday night that he was attempting to

set up an interview with Parcells for Tuesday and that he was in position to

match Tampa Bay 's salary figures in his offer to Parcells.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#4:1> Parcells rejected a five-year,

&dollar;6.5 million deal from the Buccaneers Saturday night.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#5:1> Wolf declined to comment when asked whether Parcells could have the

Packers' job if he wanted it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#6:1> But sources in the organization have said Parcells had been the No.1

candidate on the Packers' list from the start.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#7:1> However, until Sunday, Wolf believed that Parcells was unattainable.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#8:1> Wolf 's plans for the next two days also suggest that he is focusing

his search on Parcells and will offer him the job unless something develops

in the interview that makes him uncomfortable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#9:1> Wolf said he had postponed an interview with former Seattle

Seahawks coach Chuck Knox, scheduled for Monday in Palm Springs, Calif.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#10:1> Knox was believed to be the No. 2 candidate on Wolf 's list. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#11:1> Wolf 's plans for the next two days also suggest that he is focusing

his search on Parcells and will offer him the job unless something develops

in the interview that makes him uncomfortable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#12:1> Wolf said he had postponed an interview with former Seattle

Seahawks coach Chuck Knox, scheduled for Monday in Palm Springs, Calif.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#13:1> Knox was believed to be the No. 2 candidate on Wolf 's list. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#14:1> " There is a new development that has caused me to cancel the

visit and schedule it for a different time.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#15:1> Wolf said, referring to Parcells' decision to reject Tampa Bay 's

offer. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#16:1> Wolf also said he would put on hold any plans to contact

assistant coaches around the National Football League.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#17:1> Wolf interviewed Mike Holmgren, offensive coordinator of the San

Francisco 49ers, here Sunday.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#18:1> But Wolf said he would hold off on asking permission to talk to

defensive coordinators Steve Sidwell of the New Orleans Saints and Pete

Carroll of the New York Jets, who would presumably be available for

interviews now that their teams have lost in the playoffs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#19:1> After saying for several days that he planned to take his time

conducting the search, Wolf said that could change.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#20:1> " It could happen quickly," Wolf said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#21:1> " The reason I said that all along is because I never thought Bill

would come here.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#22:1> " I had him penciled in for Tampa and I felt it behooved us to

explore all avenues."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#23:1> Wolf said he had just begun his interview with Holmgren when his

telephone in the Packers offices started ringing non-stop.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#24:1> The phone rang, Wolf said, after the announcement by Buccaneers owner

Hugh Culverhouse that Parcells had turned down the job.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#25:1> Wolf said the announcement surprised him.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#26:1> Wolf said he talked to Parcells later about following through with a

meeting they had tentatively arranged last Friday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#27:1> Wolf said he did not have any assurances that Parcells would

return to coaching or accept an offer from the Packers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#28:1> " I don't have any feel," Wolf said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#29:1> " I would think he wants to coach."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#30:1> After leading the New York Giants to two Super Bowl titles in

eight years, Parcells resigned after the 1990'91 season to become a studio

analyst with NBC-TV.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#31:1> ESPN reported that NBC had agreed to let Parcells become its top

analyst next season, replacing Bill Walsh, as an incentive to remain with the

network.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#32:1> An NBC representative told the Washington Post that the report was "

categorically untrue.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#33:1> If it is true, Parcells' salary to stay with NBC could rise from

&dollar;250,000 to as much as

&dollar;600.000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#34:1> Parcells said on NBC 's pre-game show Sunday that he hadn't made

up his mind about coaching again and he might return to NBC.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#35:1> But in explaining why he rejected the Tampa Bay offer, Parcells never

once said it was because he didn't want to coach.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#36:1> With a salary offer that apparently would, have made him the

highest-paid coach in the NFL, Parcells was offered full control of the

football operation with the Buccaneers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#37:1> " I thought it may have been too big a job, too many hats to wear

in this modern time of professional football," Parcells said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#38:1> " There was just something about it in the end.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#39:1> I didn't feel right.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#40:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#41:1> Wolf can't offer Parcells full control of the football operation,

but he suggested he could match Tampa Bay 's offer of

&dollar;1.3 million per year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#42:1> " I don't think money is an issue with this franchise.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#43:1> Wolf said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#44:1> Asked specifically about the Green Bay job, Parcells said: " Ron

and I have talked.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#45:1> We agreed to setup a meeting at some point in time.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#46:1> I don't know when it is, but I just assume we will talk again in the

near future.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#47:1> Parcells denied that he ever agreed to take the Tampa Bay job. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#48:1> Culverhouse said Parcells had agreed to take it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#49:1> " I feel I was taken down to the altar and there was a choke,"

Culverhouse said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#50:1> " I'm still here 'm the altar.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#51:1> Culverhouse said he pressed Parcells for reasons and Parcells never

said he had decided not to coach.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#52:1> Culverhouse also said it wouldn't surprise him if Parcells

accepted the Green Bay job.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#53:1> " I feel Bill will feel closer to Ron Wolf" Culverhouse said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#54:1> Parcells, 50, compiled an 05-50-1? record, a 61 winning percentage as

coach of the Giants.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#55:1> In five of his eight seasons, the Giants qualified for the

playoffs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#56:1> Parcells' first team finished 3-12-1 and only one other team after

that had a losing record.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#57:1> The Giants were 6-9 in 1987.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#58:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#59:1> The Giants won the Super Bowl under Parcells in 1987 and this

year. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#60:1> Parcells was shaken in recent years when Denver Broncos coach Dan

Reeves and Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka developed heart problems.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#61:1> In the last year, physicians discovered that Parcells had extra

heartbeats.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#62:1> Two weeks ago, he underwent an angioplasty, a non-surgical procedure

to clear a blocked artery leading from the heart and although Parcells has

said NC?, the Giants afterward he was healthy enough to coach, he might be in

conflict about his future.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#63:1> " From the tone of his conversation," one friend told The New

York Times, " his head is being one way and his heart in another.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#64:1> Wolf said he was impressed with Holmgren during their meeting.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#65:1> " I liked everything about him" Wolf said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#66:1> " He was easy to talk with, talk to.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#67:1> He 's very confident of himself and it 's easy to see why they are

successful with him running the show from an offensive standpoint.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#68:1> " He 's a down-to-earth, sincere person."</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-010#69:2> <h> Drug abuse is still tearing at families.</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#70:2> <h> Officials say drug abuse is still tearing at families Reports of

abuse, neglect are down, but still severe.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#71:2> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#72:2> Rampant drug abuse among parents continues to tear apart

thousands of Milwaukee County families, although authorities reported a

reduction this year in the number of families whose children suffer from

abuse and neglect.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#73:2> The county Department of Health and Human Services will have

investigated about 8,500 cases of child abuse and neglect by the end of this

year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#74:2> That compares to an all time high of about 9,100 cases investigated

last year, department spokesman Jeff Aikin said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#75:2> " This will probably be our second biggest year of referrals

ever," Aikin said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#76:2> Department records show that nearly 80% of al&percent; child neglect

cases involve parents who are drug abusers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#77:2> A smaller but significant number of child abuse cases also involve

parents who abuse drugs, he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#78:2> Social workers said that aside from drug abuse, high-risk

indicators of child abuse and neglect included poverty, teenage parenthood

and single parenthood.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#79:2> And despite the decline in the number of cases, the seriousness of

child neglect and abuse incidents continue to increase. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#80:2> One extreme example cited by Aikin occurred / 1.20, when 10

Milwaukee children, including three who authorities said were severely

malnourished, were removed from their 38-year-old mother 's home.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#81:2> The woman, who told police she uses cocaine, was charged Friday with

Three counts of child neglect and one count of child abuse.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#82:2> All the children were turned over to the county 's Department of

Social Services and are residing in foster agencies to dehomes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#83:2> The woman 's 3-year-old boy weighed 20.2 pounds, a 28-month-old

girl weighed 17.7 pounds and a 16-month-old girl weighed 17.9 pounds, a

criminal complaint says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#84:2> Police and social workers sent to the home Dec. 20 found belt marks

on the chest and back of the 3-year-old boy. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#85:2> The mother said the marks were caused by a belt she used for

toilet training.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#86:2> In addition the 16-month-old had two infected ears and a perforated

eardrum and the 28-month-old had inflamed membranes in her ears caused by

dehydration and malnutrition, the complaint says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#87:2> The children were taken to Children 's Hospital of Wisconsin for

treatment of malnutrition and dehydration.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#88:2> Hospital personnel said the weights of the three were far below

normal.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#89:2> Normal weights for healthy children of average height aged 3 years

for boys, 28 months for girls and 16 months for girls should be about 32

pounds, 27.5 pounds and 23 pounds, respectively, hospital officials said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#90:2> Authorities, who reported there was ample food in the house, said

the woman 's other children were not suffering from malnutrition.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#91:2> The woman acknowledged that her three youngest children looked ill

police said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#92:2> " All the cases we' 'reseeing are more aggravated now than they were

10 or 15 years ago," Aikin said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#93:2> " We' 'rehoping that a number of initiatives put into place by

Milwaukee County and various private agencies to deal with child abuse are

having an impact.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#94:2>
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#95:2> <H> 1 MILLION SPENT IN PREVENTION PROGRAMS </H>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#96:2> To help curb such incidents of child abuse and neglect, Milwaukee

county spends about

&dollar;1 million in tax dollars a year for prevention programs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#97:2> In the past five years, Aikin said, the number of programs initiated

through area hospitals and private social service groups has increased.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#98:2> First-time parent programs provide services for new parents.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#99:2> Teenage parent programs offer education to teenagers, regardless of

how many children they have.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#100:2> Abuse counseling is available for parents who were victims of child

abuse.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#101:2> " There are a number of efforts underway.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#102:2> Aikin said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#103:2> " We' 'rehoping it is having an impact.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#104:2> It 's always difficult to measure success.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#105:2> But if we measure it in the number of cases we 're seeing, then we 're

having some impact.

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#106:2> The proposed Rail Energy prices is no longer a good one for

struggling businesses like Ash Grove Cement of Montana City.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#107:2> The cement making business, which earlier in the year used diesel

generators to make its own power because it could not find cheap electricity,

now has an affordable contract, said Ash Grove environmental manager Joe

Scheeler. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#108:2> The cement plant dismantled its generators at the beginning of

the month.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#109:2> " We latched onto a contract for three months, enough to get

through the summer," Scheeler said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#110:2> " Then we got a deal on a four-to-six year contract." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-010#111:2> Rail Energy also planned to locate six more power producing

locomotives north of Three Forks at Trident.
<ICE-USA:W2C-010#112:2> The fate of that project is also pending.</p> </I>
