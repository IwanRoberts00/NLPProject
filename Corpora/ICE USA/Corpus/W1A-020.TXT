<ICE-USA:W1A-020#2:1>

<p> I began asking by myself the question: " What is the best group

intervention to treat test anxiety in graduate students?"
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#3:1> I began my search by accessing the Social Work Library website.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#4:1> I conducted searches on a couple of different databases.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#5:1> The first database I searched on was ProQuest.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#6:1> I searched " test taking anxiety" and " graduate students" and " group

interventions" and received no results.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#7:1> I then simplified my search to just " test anxiety" and " graduate

students" and found some results; however, most of them were studies on test

anxiety and not on treatment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#8:1> I then added " treatment" to my previous search and found two studies

on test anxiety and treatment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#9:1> I decided to try and search ERIC.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#10:1> I entered " test anxiety" and " graduate students" and " treatment"

in the search categories and found two articles that included that criterion.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#11:1> I then searched the PsychInfo database using the terms " graduate

students", " test anxiety", and " treatment".
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#12:1> I found many articles about the treatment of test anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#13:1> I then tried to scale down my results by adding " group treatment"

and found studies that specifically had tested a group treatment approach.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#14:1> I attempted to add " evidence based practice" to this search but

found no results.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#15:1> I only included articles from scholarly journals and attempted to

look for more recent studies.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#16:1> When I could not access a journal article through the Columbia

University Library I entered the title into Google Scholar to see if the text

was available on the internet.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#17:1> After conducting my literature search I came up with my COPES

question which asks " If second year social work graduate students who are

experiencing test anxiety about the LMSW licensing exam receive cognitive

restructuring or relaxation therapy or skills training in a group setting

will they show reduced levels of anxiety after intervention?" I used this

question to guide my reading of the studies found. </p>

<p> This study synthesized the results of 56 studies on text anxiety

treatments.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#18:1> The analysis looked at studies that used cognitive-behavioral, skill

focused, cognitive, meditation, and physical exercise based interventions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#19:1> The most effective interventions were those that combined cognitive

and skills training ( E=1.22).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#20:1> The next most effective treatment was found to be behavioral and

skills training ( E=1.10).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#21:1> Behavioral interventions only were also found to be effective (

E=.80).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#22:1> Other techniques like meditation and physical exercise produced a

small effect size so were deemed less effective in reducing anxiety symptoms

( E=0.15). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#23:1> In terms of intervention techniques the analysis showed that

cognitive restructuring has the largest effect size ( E=1.10).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#24:1> Other techniques that also produced large effect sizes were combined

behavioral and skills focused training, cognitive and skills focused

training, other behavioral techniques, anxiety management training, CBT and

skills focused training, and systematic desensitization.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#25:1> Behavior modification, study skills training, meditation, and

physical exercise techniques were all shown to have small effect sizes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#26:1> This study reports the efficacy of cognitive restructuring on

reducing test anxiety symptoms.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#27:1> The study consisted of three groups with a total of thirty-six

participants who are college or graduate schools.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#28:1> One group received a cognitive restructuring treatment, one group

received an exposure treatment, and the last group received no treatment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#29:1> Based comparing the scores of questionnaires given to the group in

the first and last session, the authors found that participants in the

cognitive restructuring group experienced a greater reduction in anxiety

symptoms. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#30:1> This study looks at the effectiveness of the combination of

cognitive and relaxation therapy and study-skills training in reducing

anxiety symptoms and improving test scores.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#31:1> Forty-five undergraduate test-anxious students participated in the

study.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#32:1> The study consisted of four different groups.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#33:1> One group received relaxation and cognitive therapy, one group was

received study-skills training, one group received a combination of cognitive

and relaxation therapy and study-skills training and the last group received

no treatment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#34:1> The authors found that the combined therapy of cognitive/relaxation

therapy and study-skills training were significantly more effective than

either treatment alone in reducing anxiety symptoms. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#35:1> Many studies have found that a multimodal approach is more

effective in reducing test taking anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#36:1> In Ergene ( 2003) results show that a combination of cognitive

therapy and skills training is most effective in reducing test taking

anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#37:1> Goldfried et al. ( 1978) and Denado and Diener ( 1986) supported the

finding of the meta-analysis.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#38:1> The Ergene ( 2003) study has the highest level of scientific support

for effectiveness because it is a meta-analysis of 56 other studies.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#39:1> Bloom, Fischer, and Orme ( 2009) state that in order to provide our

clients with evidence based practices it is important to focus on studies

that are able to synthesize many different studies to find the practices with

the largest effect size.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#40:1> The quasi-experimental studies I found on test taking anxiety have

small sample sizes, varying research settings, and conflicting results.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#41:1> Ergene ( 2003) was able to test the results from these different

studies to answer the broad question of which interventions are most helpful

in reducing anxiety symptoms in test anxious participants. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#42:1> Based on research on test anxiety treatments I have decided to

create a group that combines cognitive restructuring and skills-focused

training.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#43:1> This group will address the psychological reactions that the students

have around taking the licensing test as well as teach them skills to help

with recall, organized thinking, and time management. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#44:1> For students who are interested in joining the group the

intervention will be a combination of cognitive therapy and skills-focused

training.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#45:1> These treatments are based on the theories that negative cognitions

and learning deficits cause test taking anxiety ( Jones and Petruzzi, 1995).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#46:1> The cognitive therapy technique that will be used is cognitive

restructuring.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#47:1> In the first thirty minutes of each session the main facilitator will

ask for examples from the group of negative cognitions they have had about

taking the LMSW exam.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#48:1> Examples of these cognitions include statements like " I am so stupid

I don't even know where to begin studying" and " People like me never pass

tests."
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#49:1> The group will work together to challenge any negative cognitions and

restructure them so that they are neutral or positive. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#50:1> The skills training component will compliment cognitive

restructuring because often students with test anxiety feel that they need

better skills to do well on an exam ( Poorman et al., 2009).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#51:1> The skills training component of the group will take place during the

last half an hour of each session.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#52:1> The skills training will include these topics: goal setting, time

management, improving study skills, and test-taking strategies. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#53:1> At the beginning of each session, students will be asked to

complete the Test Anxiety Inventory ( Spielberger, 1980) and take a 5

question test based on material covered on the LMSW exam.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#54:1> Homework will be assigned to practice both techniques.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#55:1> Students will be asked to keep a weekly diary card where they will

record negative thoughts they have about taking a test while outside the

group.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#56:1> Student will be asked to do a variety of different assignments in

order to practice the skills-focused training techniques they learn in group.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#57:1> These will include creating a study schedule and time management

chart. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#58:1> The first strength of these operationalized versions of the

outcomes are that the main outcome, a decreased level of anxiety, will be

measured using a standardized measure that has been proved valid and has a

set of norms for different populations. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#59:1> The second strength of these measures is that they can easily be

analyzed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#60:1> Each measurement is recording one weekly numeric score. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#61:1> The greatest weakness of these operationalized outcome measures

is that they require a lot of work from the participants.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#62:1> This is especially difficult when the problem the group is addressing

is related to performance anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#63:1> The amount of work needed for each measurement might trigger greater

anxiety in some participants. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#64:1> The target of the group intervention is anxious feelings around

test taking.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#65:1> Jones and Petruzzi ( 1995) state that negative cognitions present in

test taking anxious individual impair good performance.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#66:1> Poorman et al. ( 2009) adds that individuals often experience

behaviors like difficulty paying attention, frequently getting off task, and

increased distractibility.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#67:1> The intervention will address the different facets of test anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#68:1> The cognitive restructuring component of the intervention will seek

to reduce negative cognitions by examining the students' cognitions and

systematically altering these thoughts to promote positive thoughts around

test taking abilities.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#69:1> The skills-focused training component will focus on the behaviors

associated with test taking anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#70:1> Skills like time management, creating a study log, and various

strategies for test taking will address learning deficits and negative

behaviors.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#71:1> After the intervention students in the group will be able to alter

their own negative cognitions and use the skills learned to prepare for the

LMSW test, which will lead to lower anxiety. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#72:1> Group participation will be measured by the verbal participation

of the group participants.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#73:1> The co-facilitator will record the frequency of each persons' verbal

participation during the group session.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#74:1> Verbal participation is defined in a broad way as meaning any time a

participants speaks in the group.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#75:1> Participants will be expected to participate at least once a session.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#76:1> Without verbal participation one can assume that members are not

receiving the full benefits of being in the group. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#77:1> The strength of this kind of measure is its ease of use.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#78:1> No special equipment is needed and it is easy to chart change in

behavior over time ( Bloom, Fischer, and Orme, 2009).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#79:1> The weakness of this type of measure is that some participants might

be uncomfortable speaking in front of the group.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#80:1> This is especially true since the participants are experiencing

symptoms of anxiety that might make them feel too vulnerable to share their

feelings. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#81:1> Trends in the data will be examined in order to assess the

success of the intervention.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#82:1> Each outcome measure will be graphed for a visual analysis of the

trend.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#83:1> Since groups are made up of individuals whose scores vary there can

often be outliers that might skew a mean or standard deviation of the data (

Bloom, Fischer, and Orme, 2009).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#84:1> To avoid this all data will be plotted using a box plot that takes

into account the median score of each outcome and range of the scores.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#85:1> The baseline will be collected from the measurements administered

during the first session before the intervention. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#86:1> Research has shown that there are gender and cross-cultural

differences in the rate of test taking anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#87:1> Everson et al. ( 1991) found that women experience more anxiety

around test taking and academic achievement than men.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#88:1> Some researchers hypothesize that this is because woman are

socialized to express their emotions, while men are taught to suppress their

feelings ( Boda and Ollendick, 2005).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#89:1> Bodas and Ollendick ( 2005) also found that test anxiety differs

cross-culturally.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#90:1> The authors feel that the variation in parenting styles accounts for

much of this difference.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#91:1> In many non-Western cultures parents put excessive pressure on their

children to do well academically.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#92:1> This pressure causes non-Western children to have more test anxiety

but also more shame about that anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#93:1> Overall, Bodas and Ollenick ( 2005) suggest that there is a lack of

theoretical background in test taking anxiety that is based on the

understanding of the norms and beliefs of different cultures. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#94:1> Research around test anxiety has also been done across different

races.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#95:1> This research focuses on the achievement gap between white and Asian

students and African American, Latino, and other students of color.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#96:1> Osburne ( 2001) cites theories that reveal that non-white students

often suffer from a perceived stereotype around their academic achievement.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#97:1> This stereotype informs students that they will not do as well as

Asian and white students because of the color of their skin or their cultural

background.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#98:1> There is empirical support for this theory.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#99:1> Osburne ( 2001) notes that the implications of these theories and

findings are that if stereotype threat is removed then the racial achievement

gap will close.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#100:1> Further testing of this hypothesis has been encouraging and shows

that without the stereotype threat that students of all colors perform

relatively the same on tests. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-020#101:1> Cognitive and behavior interventions have been used

cross-culturally and with both genders ( Bodas and Ollenick, 2005 and Ergene,

2003).
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#102:1> These interventions have proven successful in reducing test anxiety

in many different groups of people.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#103:1> I feel that a group intervention that uses cognitive restructuring

techniques and skills-focused training will benefit a many different types of

people.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#104:1> This group might be most helpful for women and students of color.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#105:1> As in the research stated above women often show higher levels of

anxiety around academic achievement so this group will help them decrease

that anxiety in order to perform well on the exam.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#106:1> I think that students of color will also benefit from this group

because of the research on stereotype threat.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#107:1> Stereotype threat causes students think that they cannot do well on

a test.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#108:1> The group will address this thinking with cognitive restructuring

and through changing this negative thinking be able to decrease text anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#109:1> This group may not be the best fit for students who are from

non-Western cultures.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#110:1> Though these students have been shown to experience similar levels

of test anxiety they have been found to often feel shame around this anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#111:1> A group setting might not be the most optimal for them as they may

feel ashamed to admit their anxious feelings.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#112:1> Men may also not be the best fit for the group because studies show

that men have a harder time expressing their emotions around test anxiety.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#113:1> However, though these studies inform my understanding of who will

best be served by this group I also feel that I should acknowledge my

personal experience of being a student at CUSSW and my knowledge of my

classmates.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#114:1> I feel that this program will be optimal for most students at CUSSW

because as aspiring social workers most students are in touch with their

emotions and are able to express them to others.
<ICE-USA:W1A-020#115:1> I think that this group will adequately serve any individual who is

experiencing test taking anxiety.</p> </I>
