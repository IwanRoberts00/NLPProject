BUSINESS.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#2:1> Exxon Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in

1882.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#3:1> Divisions and affiliated companies of Exxon operate in the United

States and more than 80 other countries.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#4:1> Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and

production of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacturing of petroleum products

and transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#5:1> Exxon Chemical Company, a division of Exxon, is a major manufacturer

and marketer of petrochemicals.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#6:1> Exxon is engaged in exploration for, and mining and sale of, coal and

other minerals.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#7:1> Exxon also has an interest in electric power generation in Hong Kong.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#8:1> Affiliates of Exxon conduct extensive research programs in support of

these businesses.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#9:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#10:1> The terms corporation, company, Exxon, our, we and its, as used

in this report, sometimes refer not only to Exxon Corporation or to one of

its divisions but collectively to all of the companies affiliated with Exxon

Corporation or to any one or more of them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#11:1> The shorter terms are used merely for convenience and simplicity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#12:1> The oil industry is highly competitive.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#13:1> There is competition within the industry and also with other

industries in supplying the energy and fuel needs of commerce, industry and

individuals.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#14:1> The corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of

various goods or services in many national and international markets and

employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such

purposes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#15:1> Exxon Chemical is organized into three business groups, each

managed as a worldwide business with its own manufacturing, marketing and

technology activities.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#16:1> It is a major producer of basic petrochemicals, including olefins and

aromatics, and a leading supplier of specialty rubbers and of additives for

fuels and lubricants.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#17:1> The products manufactured include polyethylene and polypropylene

plastics, plasticizers, specialty resins, specialty and commodity solvents,

fertilizers and performance chemicals for oil field operations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#18:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#19:1> The operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates

throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time

to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations,

such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and

exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims;

expropriations of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental

regulations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#20:1> Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon

the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#21:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#22:1> In 1993, the corporation spent

&dollar;1,873 million ( of which

&dollar;641 million were capital expenditures) on environmental conservation

projects and expenses worldwide, mostly dealing with air and water

conservation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#23:1> Total expenditures for such activities are expected to be about

&dollar;2.0 billion in 1994 and 1995 ( with capital expenditures in each year

representing about 35 percent of the total) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#28:1> Estimated proved reserves are shown on pages F24 and F25 of the

accompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#29:1> No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred

estimated proved reserves as of that date.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#30:1> The oil sands reserves shown separately for Canada represent

synthetic crude oil expected to be recovered from Imperial Oil Limited 's 25

percent interest in the net reserves set aside for the Syncrude project, as

presently defined by government permit.

FEDERAL AGENCIES</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#34:1> During 1993, the company filed proved reserve estimates with the

U.S. Department of Energy on Forms EIA-23 and EIA-28.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#35:1> The information is consistent with the 1992 Annual Report to

plant liquids</p> <h <3. 
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#36:1> AVERAGE SALES PRICES AND PRODUCTION COSTS PER UNIT OF PRODUCTION</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-025#37:1> Incorporated by reference to page F22 of the accompanying

financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#38:1> Average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities

from our own production as the divisor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#39:1> Average production costs have been computed by using net production

quantities for the divisor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#40:1> The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ( NGL) production

used for this computation are shown in the reserves table on page F24 of the

accompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#41:1> The net production volumes of natural gas available for sale by the

producing function used in this calculation are shown on page F27 of the

accompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.
<ICE-USA:W1B-025#42:1> The volumes of natural gas were converted to oil equivalent barrels

based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel.</p>
