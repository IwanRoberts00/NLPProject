<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#1:1> The week the last Internet porn scandal broke, my phone didn't

stop ringing: ?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#2:1> Are women comfortable on the Net??
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#3:1> ? Should women use gender-neutral names on the Net??
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#4:1> ? Are women harassed on the Net??
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#5:1> Reporters called from all over the country with basically the same

question.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#6:1> I told them all: your question is ill-formed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#7:1> ? The Net?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#8:1> is not one thing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#9:1> It 's like asking: ? Are women comfortable in bars??
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#10:1> That 's a silly question.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#11:1> Which woman?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#12:1> Which bar? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#13:1> The summer I was 18, I was the computer counselor at a summer

camp.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#14:1> After the campers were asleep, the counselors were allowed out, and

would go bar hopping.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#15:1> First everyone would go to Maria 's, an Italian restaurant with

red-and- white-checked table cloths.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#16:1> Maria welcomed everyone from behind the bar, greeting regular

customers by name.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#17:1> She always brought us free garlic bread.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#18:1> Next we'd go to the Sandpipe 'd a disco with good dance music.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#19:1> The Sandpiper seemed excitingly adult--it was a little scary at

first, but then I loved it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#20:1> Next, we went to the Sportsman, a leather motorcycle bar that I found

absolutely terrifying.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#21:1> Huge, bearded men bulging out of their leather vests and pants leered

at me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#22:1> I hid in the corner and tried not to make eye contact with anyone,

hoping my friends would get tired soon and give me a ride back to camp. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#23:1> Each of these bars was a community, and some were more

comfortable for me than others.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#24:1> The Net is made up of hundreds of thousands of separate communities,

each with its own special character.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#25:1> Not only is the Net a diverse place, but ? women? are diverse as

well--there were leather-clad women who loved the Sportsman, and plenty of

women revel in the fiery rhetoric of Usenet 's alt.flame.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#26:1> When people complain about being harassed on the Net, they've usually

stumbled in 'vethe wrong online community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#27:1> The question is not whether ? women? are comfortable on ? the Net,?

but rather what types of communities are possible? How can we create a range

of communities so that everyone--men and women--can find a place that is

comfortable for them? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#28:1> If you're looking for a res 'rerant or bar, you can often tell

without even going in: Is the sign flashing neon or engraved wood?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#29:1> Are there lots of cars parked out front?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#30:1> What sort of cars? ( You can see all the Harleys in front of the

Sportsman from a block away.)
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#31:1> Look in the window: How are people dressed?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#32:1> We are accustomed to diversity in restaurants.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#33:1> People know that not all restaurants will please them, and employ a

variety of techniques to choose the right one. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#34:1> It 's a lot harder to find a good virtual community than it is to

find a good bar.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#35:1> The visual cues that let you spot the difference between Maria 's and

the Sportsman from across the street are largely missing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#36:1> Instead, you have to ? lurk?- enter the community and quietly explore

for a while, getting the feel of whether it 's the kind of place you're

looking for 're<ICE-USA:W2B-034#37:1> Although published guides exist, they're not always ver 'reseful--most

contain encyclopedic lists with little commentary or critical evaluation, and

by the time they're published they 're already out of 'rete.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#38:1> Magazines like NetGuide and Wired are more current and more

selective, and therefore more useful, but their editorial bias may not fit

with your personal tastes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#39:1> Commonly available network-searching tools are also useful.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#40:1> The World Wide Web is filled with searching programs, indexes, and

even indexes of indexes ( ? meta-indexes?).
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#41:1> Although browsing with these tools can be a pleasant diversion, it is

not very efficient, and searches for particular pieces of information often

end in frustration.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#42:1> If you keep an open mind, however, you may come across something

good. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#43:1> <h> Shaping an Online Society</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#44:1> But what happens if, after exploring and asking around, you still

can't find an online environment that suits you?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#45:1> Don't give up: start your own!
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#46:1> This doesn't have to be a difficult task.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#47:1> Anyone can create a new newsgroup in Usenet 's ? alt? hierarchy or

open a new chat room on America Online.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#48:1> Users of Unix systems can easily start a mailing list.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#49:1> If you have a good idea but not enough technical skill or the right

type of Net access, there are people around eager to help.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#50:1> The more interesting question is: How do you help a community to

become what you hope for? Here, I can offer some hard-won advice. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#51:1> In my research at the MIT Media Lab ( working with Professor

Mitchel Resnick), I design virtual communities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#52:1> In October of 1992, I founded a professional community for media

researchers on the Internet called MediaMOO.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#53:1> Over the past three years, as MediaMOO has grown to 1,000 members

from 33 countries, I have grappled with many of the issues that face anyone

attempting to establish a virtual community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#54:1> MediaMOO is a ? multi-user dungeon? or MUD--a virtual world on the

Internet with rooms, objects, and people from all around the world.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#55:1> Messages typed in by a user instantly appear on the screens of all

other users who are currently in the same virtual ? room.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#56:1> This real-time interaction distinguishes MUDs from Usenet newsgroups,

where users can browse through messages created many hours or days before.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#57:1> The MUD 's virtual world is built in text descriptions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#58:1> MOO stands for MUD object-oriented, a kind of MUD software ( created

by Pavel Curtis of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Stephen White, now

at InContext Systems) that allows each user to write programs to define

spaces and objects. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#59:1> The first MUDS, developed in the late 1970s, were multiplayer

fantasy games of the dungeons-and-dragons variety.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#60:1> In 1989, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University named James

Aspnes decided to see what would happen if you took away the monsters and the

magic swords but instead let people extend the virtual world.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#61:1> People 's main activity went from trying to conquer the virtual world

to trying to build it, collaboratively. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#62:1> Most MUDs are populated by undergraduates who should be doing

their homework.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#63:1> I thought it would be interesting instead to bring together a group

of people with a shared intellectual interest: the study of media.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#64:1> Ideally, MediaMOO should be like an endless reception for a

conference on media studies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#65:1> But given the origin of MUDs as violent games, giving one an

intellectual and professional atmosphere was a tall order.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#66:1> How do you guide the evolution of who uses the space and what they do

there? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#67:1> A founder/designer can't control what the community ultimately

becomes--much of that is up to the users--but can help shape it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#68:1> The personality of the community 's founder can have a great influence

on what sort of place it becomes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#69:1> Part of what made Maria 's so comfortable for me was Maria herself.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#70:1> She radiated a warmth that made me feel at home. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#71:1> Similarly, one of the most female-friendly electronic communities

I've visited i 'veew York City 's ECHO ( East Coast Hang Out) bulletin board,

run by Stacy Horn.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#72:1> Smart, stylish, and deliberately outrageous, Horn is role model and

patron saint for the ECHO-ites.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#73:1> Her outspoken but sensitive personality infuses the community, and

sends a message to women that it 's all right to speak up.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#74:1> She added a conference to ECHO called ?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#75:1> WIT?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#76:1> ( women in telecommunications), which one user describes as ?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#77:1> a warm, supportive, women-only, private conference where women 's

thoughts, experiences, wisdom, joys, and despairs are shared.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#78:1> But Horn also added a conference called ? BITCH,? which the ECHO-ite

calls ? WIT in black leather jackets.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#79:1> All-women, riotous and raunchy.? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#80:1> Horn 's high-energy, very New York brand of intelligence

establishes the kind of place ECHO is and influences how everyone there

behaves.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#81:1> When ECHO was first established, Horn and a small group of her close

friends were the most active people on the system.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#82:1> ? That set the emotional tone, the traditional style of posting, the

unwritten rules about what it 's OK to say,?
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#83:1> says Marisa Bowe, an ECHO administrator for many years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#84:1> ? Even though Stacy is too busy these days to post very much, the

tone established in the early days continues,? says Bowe, who is now editor

of an online magazine called Word. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#85:1> Beyond the sheer force of a founder 's personality, a community

establishes a particular character with a variety of choices on how to

operate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#86:1> One example is to set a policy on whether to allow participants to

remain anonymous.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#87:1> Initially, I decided that members of MediaMOO should be allowed to

choose: they could identify themselves with their real names and e-mail

addresses, or remain anonymous.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#88:1> Others questioned whether there was a role for anonymity in a

professional community. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#89:1> As time went on, I realized they were right.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#90:1> People on MediaMOO are supposed to be networking, hoping someone will

look up who they really are and where they work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#91:1> Members who are not wi11ng to share their personal and professional

identities are less likely to engage in serious discussion about their work

and consequently about media in general.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#92:1> Furthermore, comments from an anonymous entity are less valuable

because they are unsituated-- " I believe X" is less meaningful to a listener

than " I am a librarian with eight years of experience who lives in a small

town in Georgia, and I believe X."
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#93:1> In theory, anonymous participants could describe their professional

experiences and place their comments in that context; in practice it tends

not to happen that way.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#94:1> After six months, I proposed that we change the policy to require

that all new members be identified.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#95:1> Despite the protests of a few vocal opponents, most people thought

that this was a good idea, and the change was made. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#96:1> Each community needs to have its own policy on anonymity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#97:1> There 's room for diversity here too: some communities can be

all-anonymous, some all-identified, and some can leave that decision up to

each individual.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#98:1> An aside: right now on the Net no one is either really anonymous or

really identified.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#99:1> It is easy to fake an identity; it is also possible to use either

technical or legal tools to peer behind someone else 's veil of anonymity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#100:1> This ambiguous state of affairs is not necessarily unfortunate: it 's

nice to know that a fake identity that provides a modicum of privacy is easy

to construct, but that in extreme cases such people can be tracked down. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#101:1> <h> Finding Birds of a Feather</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#102:1> Another important design decision is admissions policy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#103:1> Most places on the Net have a strong pluralistic flavor, and the

idea that some people might be excluded from a community ruffles a lot of

feathers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#104:1> But exclusivity is a fact of life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#105:1> MIT wouldn't be MIT if everyone who wanted to come was admitted.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#106:1> Imagine if companies had to give jobs to everyone who applied!
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#107:1> Virtual communities, social clubs, universities, and corporations

are all groups of people brought together for a purpose.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#108:1> Achieving that purpose often requires that there be some way to

determine who can join the community. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#109:1> A key decision I made for MediaMOO was to allow entry only to

people doing some sort of " media research."
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#110:1> I try to be loose on the definition of " media"--writing teachers,

computer network administrators, and librarians are all working with forms of

media--but strict on the definition of " research."
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#111:1> At first, this policy made me uncomfortable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#112:1> I would nervously tell people, " It 's mostly a self-selection

process.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#113:1> We hardly reject anyone at all!"
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#114:1> Over time, I've 'vecome more comfortable with this restriction, and

have enforced the requirements more stringently.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#115:1> I now believe my initial unease was naive. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#116:1> Even if an online community decides to admit all comers, it does

not have to let all contributors say anything they want.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#117:1> The existence of a moderator to filter postings often makes for more

focused and civil discussion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#118:1> Consider Usenet 's two principal newsgroups dealing with feminism-

alt.feminism and soc.feminism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#119:1> In alt.feminism, anyone can post whatever they want.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#120:1> Messages in this group are filled with the angry words of angry

people; more insults than ideas are exchanged.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#121:1> ( Titles of messages found there on a randomly selected day included

" Women & the workplace ( it doesn't work)" and " What is a feminazi"?.)
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#122:1> The topic may nominally be feminism, but the discussion itself is

not feminist in nature. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-034#123:1> The huge volume of postings ( more than 200 per day, on average)

shows that many people enjoy writing such tirades.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#124:1> But if I wanted to discuss some aspect of feminism, alt.feminism

would be the last place I' 'dgo.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#125:1> Its sister group, soc.feminism, is moderated--volunteers read

messages submitted to the group and post only those that pass muster.
<ICE-USA:W2B-034#126:1> Moderators adhere to soc.feminism 's lengthy charter, which explains

the criteria for acceptable postings--forbidding ad hominem attacks, for

instance. </p> </I>
