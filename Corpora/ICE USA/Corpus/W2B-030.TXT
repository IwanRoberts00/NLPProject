<ICE-USA:W2B-030#1:1> <h> Vaccines against Cancer </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#2:1> This organism is a " great simulator," yet when you follow its

developmental life cycle through all its transitional stages using darkfield

microscopic analysis of live blood, " it can be identified as a single

agent," stated Dr. Livingston.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#3:1> She never claimed to be the first discoverer of P. cryptocides, noting

that it has been " an unclassified mystery" periodically rediscovered since

the early 1800s. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#4:1> Despite the laboratory work, the photos of P. cryptocides from

live blood, the scientific papers and books, Dr. Livingston 's cancer microbe

remains " the most closeted achievement of our century," Dr. Cantwell

contends.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#5:1> " Her findings today mean nothing to oncologists.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#6:1> Her discoveries don't exist.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#7:1> How can they credit bacteria seen in living blood when they consider

blood to be sterile?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#8:1> In 1974, Dr. Livingston discoverd that the cancer microbe secretes

a hormone called choriogonadotropin ( CG), that is a cell growth regulator

similiar to human growth hormone secreted by the brain.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#9:1> " Unless CG is controlled by antibodies, white cells, and dietary

factors, it can continue its reproductive activity indefinitely in an

uncontrolled way," she said.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#10:1> CG protects the growing tumor from ingestion by the immune system.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#11:1> Further, Dr. Livingston claimed that the cancer microbe is

present inside sperm cells and, at conception, it releases the CG hormone to

protect the fertilized egg.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#12:1> It does this because otherwise at least half of fetal cells would be

regarded by the body as foreign and it would seek to destroy them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#13:1> With this new biological understanding of the cancer process, Dr.

Livingston went on to develop a practical, nontoxic approach.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#14:1> In general, she Dr. Cantwell ruled out surgery because it would be

impossible admits that it to remove all cancerous tissues as the disease is

might have been systemic.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#15:1> Also, " extensive mutilating surgery" premature for would help spread

the cancer by shocking the adrenal glands and further weakening the immune

system which would now have to aid the body in healing from the surgery in

addition to continuing to resist the cancer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#16:1> However, Dr. Livingston advised having surgery to remove the tumor

load if it could be easily removed without mutilation of the patient. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#17:1> A better approach, she proposed, would be to support the immune

system, increase the body 's Staphylococcus resistance, and suppress the

specific cancer microbe by eliminating the internal bodily conditions that

enable it to thrive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#18:1> A prime way to accomplish this, said Dr. Livingston, is through the

use of specifically targeted vaccines, especially one prepared and precisely

tailored from the patient 's own P. cryptocides. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#19:1> Such a vaccine focuses on more than cancer--it addresses the

entire immune system.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#20:1> This perspective came in handy in the late 1960s when an FDA official

told Dr. Livingston she vaccinate could not treat cancer with vaccines.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#21:1> " I assured him I was not treating cancer with vaccines but that I am

using autogenous [ 'self-made,' from the patient 's own cultured P.

cryptocides] vaccines obtained from the patient 's own tissues and bodily

fluids to treat an underlying chronic infection." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#22:1> It 's no different in 1997, says the Center 's medical director,

Mark H. LaBeau, D.O.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#23:1> The Center bills itself as specializing in the treatment of "

immuno-deficiency" diseases.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#24:1> As it turns out, about 95&percent; of their patients are people with cancer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#25:1> " We work with people and their weakened immune systems," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#26:1> The Livingston approach consists of multiple vaccines, dietary and

nutritional programs, and psychological counseling.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#27:1> According to Dr. LaBeau, among the cancer cases, the Center tends to

get the best results with cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon, and

lymph system. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#28:1> <h> Immunotherapy Based on Vaccines </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#29:1> This phase of the Livingston program consists of six vaccines,

several of them patented by Dr. Livingston.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#30:1> Their purpose is to stimulate production of antibodies to control the

spread of P. cryptocides, raise the white blood cell count and

disease-resisting potential of patients, stimulate key immune system cells (

natural killer and B cells), and support the immune system in functioning

more efficiently, says Dr. LaBeau.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#31:1> " Dr. Livingston found that when you use these six vaccines together

you get a compounding effect and better results." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#32:1> Vaccine A--Here the cancer microbe itself is collected from the

patient 's own P. cryptocides, cultured overnight at room temperature in the

laboratory, then filtered, concentrated, and injected into the muscle as a

vaccine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#33:1> The purified bacteria acts as an irritant ( antigen) that provokes

the immune system to respond to it and produce antibodies ( specialized

defense proteins) against it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#34:1> Vaccine B--This vaccine is prepared and purified from " killed" (

sterilized) bacteria cultured from the P. cryptocides of a patient who has

successfully overcome the cancer microbe. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#35:1> BCG Vaccine--The Bacillus Calmette-Gu}rin uses highly weakened

tuberculosis ( TB) microbes to evoke a strong immune response against cancer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#36:1> The BCG vaccine has been commonly used against TB since its

introduction in 1921.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#37:1> BCG is effective against cancer ( as a " protective" factor) because

Dr. Livingston 's research showed that its structure is highly similar to that

of P. cryptocides.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#38:1> " When the immune system is stimulated with BCG to react to

tuberculosis bacteria, it is also stimulated to cross-react to P.

cryptocides," says Dr. LaBeau. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#39:1> Gamma Globulin--This is a conventional vaccine substance

consisting of five different types of specialized proteins or antibodies (

called immunoglobulins) normally found in healthy blood.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#40:1> Gamma globulin helps the immune system resist infection by supplying

it with more of the body 's basic disease-resisting substances. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#41:1> Vaccine C--This vaccine combines purified glandular extracts of

sheep thymus and spleen to support the immune activities of both organs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#42:1> The thymus gland, located behind the sternum in the chest, produces

immune cells called T lymphocytes or T cells; this gland also secretes a

hormone that controls the growth and maturation of these cells.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#43:1> The spleen produces T cells and cleanses the blood by removing

parasites among the red blood cells. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#44:1> Generally, a large dose of vitamin B-12 ( 1 cc) is added to

Vaccine C as a nutritional supplement because a vegetarian diet is deficient

in this vitamin.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#45:1> It 's given in an injectable form because it is better absorbed than

in an oral form. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#46:1> Vaccine D--Using an extract of white blood cells, this vaccine is

injected into the patient to stimulate their own T cells, Dr. LaBeau

explains. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#47:1> Other Vaccines--Livingston physicians occasionally use MRV, or

mixed respiratory vaccine, which contains common respiratory bacteria.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#48:1> For selected patients, depending on their tumor type, they may also

employ interferon, immune proteins produced by white blood cells against

viruses, given in extremely small doses as an additional immune response

booster. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#49:1> Livingston patients typically receive all six vaccines at the

same time, three times weekly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#50:1> This schedule is usually maintained for the first year or until a

remission is achieved; after this, the patient is likely to receive only

three or four of the vaccines.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#51:1> As a protective measure, after remission, vaccines are ideally

administered on a less frequent basis for the rest of the person 's life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#52:1> As the Livingston Center is an exclusively outpatient facility with

an initial ten-day program, patients are instructed in self-administering the

injections at home ( with the exception of BCG). </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#53:1> <h> Anticancer Diet and Nutrition</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#54:1> " One of the most vital systems of the body that cannot be

sustained by devitalized, dead food is the immune system," said Dr.

Livingston.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#55:1> In addition to dietary guidance, each patient receives an

individually tailored nutritional protocol consisting of, potentially, almost

40 different supplements.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#56:1>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#57:1> Dietary Recommendations--First off, avoid all poultry products,

including chicken and eggs, advises Livingston Center 's staff nutritionist

Janet Zuckerman, B.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#58:1> She notes that the primary reason for including or eliminating foods

is their likely effect on the cancer microbe. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#59:1> In most cases, patients should eliminate fish, pork, beef, veal,

and most dairy products from the diet, too, relying primarily on vegetarian

protein sources.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#60:1> Living fresh foods, such as nonprocessed whole grains and beans and

organically raised fruits and vegetables, are recommended.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#61:1> The diet also calls for avoiding fluoridated water, alcohol, soft

drinks, tobacco, chemical ingredients, and sugar-based foods. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#62:1> Abscisic Acid--This natural component of vitamin A is the

foundation upon which all cancer immunity is built because it " actually

stops cancer cells from multiplying" and is " nature 's most potent anticancer

weapon," explained Dr. Livingston.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#63:1> Abscisic acid is found in small amounts in raw yellow vegetables (

notably carrots), nuts, seeds, and certain vitamin A rich fruits ( mangoes,

grapes, pears, apples).
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#64:1> Abscisic acid is believed to decrease the secretion of the growth

hormone found in tumor cells. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#65:1> Dr. Livingston synthesized an abscisic acid formula called CIS 14

which is available as a supplement only to Livingston Center patients.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#66:1> A typical dose is 1/4 teaspoon in a base of arrowroot powder. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#67:1> Vitamins--For the first 30 days of their treatment, cancer

patients take 20 drops ( 5,000 IUs per drop) daily of vitamin A mixed into

freshly pulped carrot juice, and at least 400 IUs of vitamin E.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#68:1> They also get 8-10 g of vitamin C, in divided doses ( although doses

up to 40 g daily may be given, usually intravenously), and a complete

vitamin, mineral, and trace element package in the form of Daily Care(tm), a

formula developed by the Livingston Center. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#69:1> Digestive Supports--Enzymes are given to Livingston Center

patients to facilitate better digestion of foods as are supplements of "

friendly bacteria" such as L. acidophilus and L. bifidus to improve

intestinal activity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#70:1> Lymph System Stimulation--As an osteopath, Dr. LaBeau is keenly

attuned to the status of the patient 's lymph system, knowing that its

efficient drainage and removal of toxins from the body is crucial to

restoring health.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#71:1> He notes that about 30&percent; of his cancer patients have a musculoskeletal

problem ( as evidenced by restricted movement) at the direct site of the

tumor, such as the pelvis or breast, and that another 30&percent; have similar

problems near key lymph drainage and immune function sites. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#72:1> In these cases, Dr. LaBeau either provides the patient with

osteopathic manipulation during their ten-day program, or makes a referral

for more long-term treatment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#73:1> In either event, the goal, he says, is to remove the musculoskeletal

and lymph interference which, in turn, helps the body use the other program

components to eliminate the cancer. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#74:1> <h> Clarifying the Psychological Side</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#75:1> " The Livingston Center believes that mental attitude can have a

profound impact on the effective treatment and continued good health of a

patient," explains clinical director and staff psychologist Robert Barrett,

Ph.D. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#76:1> Since patients do not reside at the Livingston Center, there is

not enough time for Dr. Barrett to do in-depth counseling.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#77:1> However, he introduces patients to both the theoretical and practical

sides of how their emotions and stress levels interact with their immune

system and its ability to restore health. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#78:1> Typically, during his series of one-hour classes, Dr. Barrett

explains the benefits and techniques of stress reduction, progressive muscle

relaxation, visualizations, meditation, lifestyle changes, ways of coping and

positive attitude-building.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#79:1> " I look for situations or concerns they may have to face when they

return home.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#80:1> The goal is to help the person restructure the way they see their

situation, to show them what a different emotional response might lead to,"

says Dr. Barrett. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#81:1> " One thing that stresses many patients is the assumption that

because they have cancer they should be thinking about death," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#82:1> " They may be rehearsing the thought continually in their mind that

cancer is a killer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#83:1> I suggest to them that, yes, getting cancer is a wake-up call to

reconsider many things, yet many people survive cancer, and that the more

positive their attitude is about surviving, the more likely it is that this

will help their healing process." </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#84:1> <h> How It Works in Practice: Reversing Colon Cancer</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#85:1> Today, Dorothy, 73, is free of cancer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#86:1> When she came to the Livingston Center 12 years ago with a diagnosis

of colon cancer, the prognosis was not good.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#87:1> Two years earlier, she had undergone surgery to remove the cancerous

part of her colon and at that time there was no evidence the cancer had

spread elsewhere in her body.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#88:1> But in October 1985, Dorothy had a CT scan that indicated her cancer

had spread to the right lobe of her liver and to her pancreas. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#89:1> At the time of her arrival at the Livingston Center a month

later, Dorothy reported she had lost 22 pounds in the previous three months,

and had been suffering from nausea, lower abdominal cramps, and intractable

lower back pain.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#90:1> This last symptom had developed as a result of having been struck by

a car nine years earlier. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#91:1> " The motor vehicle accident is pertinent to Dorothy 's cancer,"

says Dr. LaBeau, " because she required multiple surgeries and transfusions

of 11 pints of blood.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#92:1> These 11 different sources of blood basically introduced 11 more

sources of potential infection by P. cryptocides." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#93:1> Other than the previous colon surgery, the Livingston program was

the first course of cancer therapy Dorothy received.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#94:1> During the initial ten-day program, she began the vaccine series,

intravenous vitamin C and B complex, specialized diet, and other supplements

" to reduce the amount of the cancer microbe and to enhance immune

functioning," Dr. LaBeau says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#95:1> She also attended the Center 's classes on stress management, coping

strategies, and techniques for dealing with cancer with a positive and

optimistic attitude. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#96:1> In April 1987, Dorothy was reevaluated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#97:1> She reported that her only complaint was abdominal distress from the

dietary changes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#98:1> A CT scan showed a cyst on her right kidney but no signs of cancer in

her liver, pancreas, or spleen.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#99:1> Over the last ten years, says Dr. LaBeau, Dorothy has continued with

the Livingston program and returned once yearly for a checkup.
<ICE-USA:W2B-030#100:1> Her lower back pain continued because she declined to undergo the

recommended osteopathic treatment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-030#101:1> All clinical signs, such as urine analysis and blood

chemistries, are within normal limits and Dorothy shows " no clinical

evidence of malignant disease," says Dr. LaBeau. </p> </I>
