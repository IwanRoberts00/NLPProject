<ICE-USA:W1A-016#1:1> <h> 1. There is no best method.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#2:1> Although novice teachers might think that a best method exists,

they will be sorely disappointed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#3:1> All language learners are different ( see my response to
#9, below), so an effective teacher must draw from a range of methods in a

principled manner.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#4:1> Understanding the history of language teaching and identifying

similarities and differences between methods can also help a teacher realize

that each method is a reaction to a past method and can be useful in

different contexts.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#5:1> If there is no best method, how should a teacher proceed?
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#6:1> Researchers have identified numerous principles for teachers to follow

in the absence of a single best method.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#7:1> According to Celce-Murcia ( 2001), for example, a good teacher

assesses students' needs; identifies " what can reasonably be taught" based

on factors such as time constraints, class size, and materials; tailors

activities to students' attitudes and learning styles and to the situations

and genres in which students need to communicate successfully; and figures

out how to assess students' learning in a fair manner ( p. 10).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#8:1> Moreover, gathering information about one 's teaching, whether through,

e.g., student surveys, peer observations, or field notes, can provide

important information on the effectiveness of one 's teaching and the nature

of students' learning ( Murphy, 2001).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#9:1> Kumaravadivelu ( 1994), however, advocates that teachers abandon

the concept of method entirely.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#10:1> He suggests that we have now reached a " postmethod condition" that

has resulted from our " heightened awareness" that there is no best method:

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#11:1> Having witnessed how methods go through endless cycles of life,

death, and rebirth, we now seem to have reached a state of heightened

awareness--an awareness that as long as we are caught up in the web of

method, we will continue to get entangled in an unending search for an

unavailable solution, an awareness that such a search drives us to

continually recycle and repackage the same old ideas and an awareness that

nothing short of breaking the cycle can salvage the situation. ( 1994, p.

28)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#12:1> Kumaravadivelu argues that being aware that there is no best

method is futile; despite this knowledge, we are still " recyl[ing] and

repackag[ing]" in order to create the best possible combination of methods.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#13:1> The only solution, Kumaravadivelu argues, is to stop looking for

methods and to abandon the concept entirely.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#14:1> He states that we need an alternative to method that empowers

teachers to theorize from their practice and encourages them to listen to

their " subjective understandings" ( or " sense of plausibility") ( 1994, p.

31) that arise from their experience and education.. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#15:1> Kumaravadivelu 's solution is to give teachers " macrostrategies,"

which, he implies, are the basis of all good language teaching.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#16:1> His strategies include maximizing opportunities for students to

learn, privileging the negotiation of meaning, using inductive learning,

contextualizing the linguistic input, integrating language skills instead of

teaching them separately, promoting learners' autonomy, making the

instruction relevant to the learners, and raising the learners' cultural

awareness.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#17:1> These strategies, along with Celce-Murcia 's ( 2001) suggestions noted

above, could be considered good principles for language teaching that will

help teachers and learners succeed"without reliance on ( a) method."</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#18:1> <h> 4. It is important for teachers to understand the notion of

top-down and bottom-up processing.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#19:1> Proficient language users rely on both top-down and bottom-up

processing when they read or listen.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#20:1> When we hear or read something, we draw on our schema and background

knowledge to interpret and predict what is going on, such as when we make

inferences about a character 's behavior or predict the content and direction

of a professor 's lecture.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#21:1> Simultaneously, however, we are decoding what we hear or read at an

incredibly fast rate.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#22:1> We may only notice our decoding processes when we are forced to slow

down, such as when we read an academic text in an unfamiliar discipline or

listen for specific pieces of information in, say, a traffic report. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#23:1> Teachers should understand these concepts because students need

help developing not just bottom-up processing but also top-down and

interactive processing in listening, pronunciation, and reading instruction.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#24:1> How many of us actually think about what we are saying or hearing

sound-by-sound" ( Goodwin, 2001, p. 119)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#25:1> Wilcox Peterson ( 2001) recommends activating students' top-down

processing skills before every listening activity and building automaticity

in bottom-up processing ( p. 89); otherwise, students will get frustrated at

the slow rate at which they decode what they see and hear.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#26:1> Reading rate development materials"which help students read in

chunks, minimize regressions, and minimize the number of fixations"may be

especially useful to develop automaticity in reading.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#27:1> Moreover, curricula now reflect the understanding that students

need practice at all leveles of processing.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#28:1> Goodwin ( 2001) reports that in pronunciation instruction, the

bottom-up approach is being replaced by a more balanced approach in which "

the sound system is addressed as it naturally occurs in the stream of speech"

( p. 119).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#29:1> Suprasegmental features ( e.g., thought groups, prominence,

intonation) are taught first and segmentals ( e.g., consonants, vowels) are

focused on at various points, akin to a " zoom lens" ( p. 119).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#30:1> Many reading researchers have reached a similar conclusion: teachers

need to teach both phonics and whole language, a " whole-to-part-to-whole"

approach ( Ediger, 2001, p. 161) that stresses both comprehension and

decoding. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#31:1> When planning lessons, teachers should consider that that

reliance on bottom-up or top-down processing often depends on several

factors: the student 's prior knowledge of the task or topic and the purpose,

or function, of listening ( Morley, 2001, citing Richards, 1990).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#32:1> Morley cites a few of Richards' examples: If the student is listening

in order to interact and socialize with others, then top-down processing

dominates; and if student is listening to a friend tell a joke, then

bottom-up processing dominates.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#33:1> Yet if the student is listening in order to extract or convey

information, bottom-up processing dominates; and if the student is listening

to something he or she has heard many times before, such as a flight

attendant 's safety instructions, then top-down processing dominates ( pp.

74-75).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#34:1> A teacher can use Richards' matrix of listening functions and

processes to design lessons that develop students' listening skills in an

appropriate way.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#35:1> In addition, teachers should consider not just helping students

develop these skills but also teaching them the metalanguage so that they can

select levels of processing strategically.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#36:1> Wilcox Peterson ( 2001) recommends helping students to understand the

different ways they process language and to " [ n]otice how their processing

operations interact with the text" ( p. 89).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#37:1> Students can then choose listening strategies strategically. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#38:1> <h> 5. Accuracy and fluency should receive equal emphasis in the L2

curriculum</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#39:1> xfIn the past, methods such as grammar translation and

audiolingualism emphasized accurate output over meaningful, fluent

communication.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#40:1> With the introduction of communicative language teaching, however,

teachers and researchers agree that there should be a balance between fluency

and accuracy.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#41:1> According to Lazarton ( 2001), " it is no longer acceptable to focus

only on developing the grammatical competence of our students [ ...] Today,

teachers are expected to balance a focus on accuracy with a focus on fluency

as well." ( p. 104).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#42:1> In reference to oral skills, Lazarton defines " fluency" as both

attention to suprasegmental features and to the negotiation of meaning ( p.

104).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#43:1> In reference to writing skills, fluency might refer to the ability to

generate lots of text ( e.g., through freewriting), and, as in Lazarton 's

definition, the ability to negotiate meaning. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#44:1> Despite the consensus that there must be a balance, there are

still misconceptions about the role of accuracy in communicative language

teaching.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#45:1> According to Savignon ( 2001), " The perceived displacement of

attention to morphosyntactic features in learner expression in favor of a

focus on meaning has led in some cases to the impression that grammar is not

important, or that proponents of CLT favor learner self-expression without

regard to form" ( p. 24-25).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#46:1> Savignon argues that the appropriate balance depends on such factors

as the students' age, the curriuclum, and the students' opportunities for

using the language outside of classroom ( p. 25).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#47:1> Additional factors affecting attention to form are the goals of

the activity.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#48:1> In a communicative activity, explicit error correction would

interfere with communication, so the teacher might merely want to make a note

of form-related errors and give feedback later.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#49:1> During activities that focus on form, however, the teacher could

point out the error when it occurs or could also bring it up later.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#50:1> An oral skills activity that develops both fluency and accuracy is

the audiotaped dialogue journal ( Lazarton, 2001, p. 109).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#51:1> The student records an impromptu reaction to a topic or prompt, and

the teacher can then react to its content and/or to the student 's grammar and

pronunciation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#52:1> In a writing class, attention to grammatical correctness is best

done when the student is working on a near-final draft, that is, once the

student' content is set ( Kroll, 2001, p. 229).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#53:1> Yet merely pointing out grammatical errors in a near-final draft is

not enough to help students with accuracy; error feedback is most useful when

the student has already learned about the error via a minilesson and has had

practice identifying and correcting the error in his or her own writing or in

a peer 's writing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#54:1> For instruction that focuses on form to be successful, a teacher

should be aware of " options in how to make a rule explicit or not; whether

or not to isolate a rule; whether an explanation should involve a deductive

or inductive presentation; who should give the explanation: the teacher, the

text, or another student; whether the language is abstract or not; and

whether the explanation is provided orally or in writing" ( Crookes &

Chaudron, 2001, p. 32). </p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#55:1> <h> 6. A specific purpose approach to curriculum design is more

efficient than a general purpose approach.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#56:1> This statement carries two assumptions: that one approach to

curriculum design can be more efficient than another and that there is such a

thing as a " general purpose" approach.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#57:1> I will address each assumption in turn and then discuss ways in which

a specific purpose approach requires substantial planning time. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#58:1> First, different learners have different learning styles and

strategies ( Oxford, 2001), and there is no one-size-fits-all-approach for "

efficient" learning.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#59:1> Yet according to Strevens ( 1988), one of the benefits of ESP is that

it is " focused on the learner 's need and wastes no time" ( qtd. in Johns and

Price-Machado, 2001, p. 44).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#60:1> The ESP curriculum may indeed " waste no time" because of its design

principles or " absolute characteristics," which are that the curriculum "

meets the specified needs of the learner"; teaches content and language

skills appropriate to the " particular disciplines, occupations, or

activities," and is not " General English" ( Strevens, 1988, qtd. in Johns

and Price-Machado, 2001, p. 44).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#61:1> The implications of these characteristics are that if the learners do

not need to develop a certain language skill or function for their specific

purpose--say, perhaps only reading knowledge of the language is necessary, or

perhaps the learner will be communicating over the phone much more than in

writing--then the specific purpose curriculum will reflect those needs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#62:1> To the extent that the curriculum is tailored to learners' needs, the

specific purpose approach may be more efficient in helping learners

communicate successfully in their specific context, be it electronics

assembly, nursing, or a graduate program. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#63:1> However, what is a " general purposes" approach? I agree with

Johns and Price-Machado 's ( 2001) assertion that there is no such thing as "

General English": " All language and language classes are specific to the

learner, the context, and the content" ( p. 54).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#64:1> I would qualify this by saying that all good language classes are

those things, but even if a teacher teaches language and content that is

irrelevant to his or her learners and their contexts, this curriculum design

is not " General" English, just perhaps " off-target" English or English

poorly specified to the learners' needs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#65:1> A preemployment VESL class, which teaches job skills such as making

requests and answering the phone, is still teaching skills for a specific

purpose, even though Johns and Price-Machado note that it is a " modified

version of a general ESL class" ( 2001, p. 51). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-016#66:1> Although a specific purpose curriculum may help learners reach

their communicative goals more efficiently than, say, a poorly specified

curriculum, it may be more time-consuming to plan because it involves, among

other things, a needs assessment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#67:1> A true specific purpose curriculum, in fact, requires a needs

assessment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#68:1> Such an activity helps curriculum designers determine what students

need to do in English in their specific context or occupation and how they do

it.
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#69:1> A needs assessment can be performed by asking students or other

stakeholders to fill out questionnaires or participate in interviews, by

observing or shadowing students on the job, by determining students' learning

styles, and by analyzing spoken or written reflections by students or their

supervisors ( Johns and Price-Machado, 2001, p. 49).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#70:1> The ESP curriculum also includes continual assessment of " what types

of content are central, how content is used and valued, and the relationships

between vocabulary and central concepts" ( p. 50).
<ICE-USA:W1A-016#71:1> Additionally, the curriculum designers might analyze the discourses

and genres of the specific context or occupation. </p> </I>
