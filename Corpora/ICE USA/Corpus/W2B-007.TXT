<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#1:1> What is dominant [ in the symbol] is the inexpressible which, in

seeking expression, will ultimately burst the too fragile vessel of earthly

form by the infinite power of its being.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#2:1> But herewith the clarity of vision is itself immediately destroyed,

and all that remains is speechless wonder.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#3:1> <h> Friedrich Creuzer in Walter Benjamin, The Origin of German Tragic

Drama</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#4:1> The discussion of the differentiation of the allegorical and

symbolic has had considerable influence on the conceptualization and

validation of specific artistic techniques and forms of aesthetic experience.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#5:1> The Romantic denigration of the allegorical and its corresponding

affirmation of the symbolic began with Goethe in the late 18th-Century and

subsequently found its way into the writings of A.W. Schlegel, Fredrich W.J.

Schelling, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Novalis in Germany, as well as Samuel

Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and Thomas Carlyle in England.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#6:1> Continuing interest in the symbol-allegory distinction can be found in

the literary criticism of Roman Jakobson, Northrop Frye, and Paul de Man, and

the work of a number of other contemporary art critics and historians such as

Craig Owens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#7:1> In his Trauerspiel study, Walter Benjamin attempted to redeem the

allegorical mode as an artistic technique on par with that of the symbolic.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#8:1> Although Benjamin 's text dealt exclusively with the Baroque period, it

is apparent that allegory informs not only the Modernist techniques of

Montage, Collage and Assemblage in both literature and visual arts, but the

whole of interpretive writing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#9:1> It therefore becomes important to comprehend the historical genesis of

this distinction.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#10:1> This shall not be undertaken merely as an attempt to redeem Modernist

forms of allegory for ourselves, but to lead us to the validation of a

broader range " aesthetic" experience.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#11:1> <h> I. The Beautiful Symbol </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#12:1> The earliest characterization of the symbol that we can clearly

recognize as our own is found in Kant 's Critique of Judgment ( 1790).
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#13:1> In &sect59 entitled 'Beauty as a Symbol of Morality' Kant objects to

the improper use of the word 'symbol' to describe mathematical abstractions (

e.g.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#14:1> symbolic logic), and instead defines the symbolical as a form of

hypotyposis, a rhetorical mode involving 'presentation' or 'sensible

illustration'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#15:1> For Kant, there are two forms of hypotyposis: schematical and

symbolical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#16:1> Both confer something of the nature of a concept ( Begriff) without

being mere signs directly designating the concept itself.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#17:1> The schematical mode illustrates the concept by demonstration, acting

as a formal analog to the concept ( as a drawn triangle would refer to the

abstract principle which it both represents and conforms).
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#18:1> On the other hand the symbolic mode represents that for which, " no

sensory representation would be appropriate."
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#19:1> Paul de Man described hypotyposis in general as, " [ that] which

makes present to the senses something which is out of their reach, not just

because it does not happen to be there but because it consists, in whole or

in part, of elements too abstract for sensory representation.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#20:1> The symbolic in this sense expresses a concept, " not by means of

direct intuition, but only by analogy with it, i.e. by the transference of

reflection upon the object of intuition to a quite different concept to which

perhaps an intuition can never directly correspond."
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#21:1> The reflection of the object at hand in the intuition or imagination,

brings forth a correlation with a concept for which there is no adequate

representation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#22:1> Kant 's relation of beauty to morality operates symbolically;

morality is not found to reside in the beautiful form ( i.e.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#23:1> beauty is not the sensuous presentation of 'mora 'mty'), nor does

beauty demonstratively 'show' the nature of morality ( as would a schema).
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#24:1> Instead the relationship is one of analogy in which the two concepts 'beauty'

and 'mor 'mity' are found to function according to similar formal principle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#25:1> Kant states that language is, " full of indirect presentations of

this sort, in which the expression does not contain the proper schema for the

concept, but merely a symbol for reflection," as when for example the word 'ground'

is substituted for 'support' or 'basis', or to 'flow' from something is

employed instead of 'to follow'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#26:1> Thus, it is through a process akin to metaphor that beautiful form is

found to represent morality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#27:1> This formulation is directly linked to Kant 's discussion of

non-discursive knowledge, and represents a manner in which empirical sense

experience can lead to knowledge of concepts which would otherwise be

unavailable through purely empirical or conceptual means.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#28:1> Although this brief statement represents one of the earliest

formulations of the modern symbol, Kant never returned to this line of

thought in his later writings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#29:1> In the end it was not Kant, but Goethe, whose formulation of the

symbol-allegory distinction became definitive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#30:1> Before Goethe the terms 'symbol' and 'allegory' were used

interchangeably to name any general mode in which one thing served to

designate another.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#31:1> Hans-Georg Gadamer notes that, " Winckelmann, whose influence on the

aesthetics and philosophy of history of the time was very great, used both

terms synonymously; the same was true of eighteenth-century aesthetics as a

whole.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#32:1> Goethe redefined the pair antithetically to describe two forms of

representation each with its own method and result.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#33:1> The most succinct statement of this is found in his Werke:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#34:1> 1. Symbolism transforms appearance into an idea, the idea into an

image in such a way that the idea remains always infinitely effective and

unreachable in the image and remains ineffable even if uttered in all

languages.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#35:1> 2. Allegory transforms appearance into a concept, the concept

into an image, but in such a way that the concept can be grasped and can be

had completely as something delimited in the image and can be expressed in

it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#36:1> 3. It is a big difference whether the poet looks for the

particular in the general or whether he sees the general in the particular.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#37:1> The former produces allegory, where the particular has validity only

as an example of the general; the latter, however, is the actual nature of

poetry; it expresses the particular without thinking of the general or

without pointing at it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#38:1> He who grasps this particular vividly gets the general with it at the

same time without being aware of it, or only late.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#39:1> As described by Goethe in the first two points, symbolism and

allegory are related yet discrete modes of representation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#40:1> Formed by coincidence of sensible appearance and supra-sensible

meaning, the symbol seeks to represent the ineffable and " unrepresentable"

from within the confines of the concrete particular.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#41:1> The relationship of form and content in the symbol is indissoluble,

not to say that a particular form necessarily contains a specific content,

but that 'form' in general allows us access to the ineffable content which

unintentionally appears in the 'vivid representation of the particular'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#42:1> This unity of form and content endows the symbol with its perceived "

fullness" and inexhaustibility.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#43:1> In contrast, allegory expresses a particular content which remains

equally communicable through another instance of language or another form.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#44:1> At a fundamental level the relation of form and content in allegory

is arbitrary.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#45:1> As Goethe states, both modes negotiate between sensuous

appearance ( <foreign> Schein </foreign> ) and meaningful image ( <foreign>

Bild </foreign> ) .
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#46:1> Although both modes result in the creation of a meaningful image, the

content of the ' 'maning' in each instance depends upon the nature of their

mediation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#47:1> As Tzvetan Todorov suggests:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#48:1> The concept, belonging strictly to reason, is opposed to the Idea

in the symbol--we may suppose that the 'idea' is drawn by Kantian overtones

toward a global and 'intuitive' apprehension.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#49:1> This difference is important, and new: for the first time Goethe

affirms that symbol and allegory do not have identical content, are not just

vehicles for expressing 'the same thing'.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#50:1> In the symbol this is accomplished by the relation of appearance

and 'Idea', whereas allegory transforms appearance into image by way of a 'concept'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#51:1> Because symbol and allegory undergo distinct mediations their content

is non-identical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#52:1> The Kantian 'Idea', " representation of the imagination which induces

much thought, yet without the possibility of any definite thought whatever,

i.e.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#53:1> concept, being adequate to it, and which language, consequently, can

never get on level terms with or render completely intelligible," is given a

privileged position.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#54:1> The Idea is greater than the mere concept of rational understanding,

being irreducible to it, and simultaneously 'above' language which fails to

encompass it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#55:1> The 'Idea' as represented in the symbol remains, following Goethe, 'infinitely

effective and unreachable'; its complete comprehension is postponed or held

out of reach of the subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#56:1> What is represented by the 'Idea' is more than mere phenomenological

experience.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#57:1> Schelling describes the symbol, " as concrete, resembling only

itself, like an image, and yet as universal and full of meaning as a

concept.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#58:1> The unity of form and content, of appearance and Idea, comprises the

ontological nature of the symbol.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#59:1> Hegel, for all his criticism of Schelling, maintains this definition

in his 1835 The Philosophy of Fine Arts:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#60:1> Inasmuch, however, as it is the function of art to represent the

idea to immediate vision in sensuous shape and not in the form of thought and

pure spirituality in the strict sense, and inasmuch as the value and

intrinsic worth of this presentment consists of the correspondence and unity

of the two aspects, that is the idea and its sensuous shape, the supreme

level and excellence and the reality, which is truly consonant with its

notion, will depend upon the degree of intimacy and union which idea and

configuration appear together in elaborated fusion.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#61:1> In contrast, allegorical representation is easily delimited by

the content of its attendant concept.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#62:1> In his 1819 World as Will and Idea, Arthur Schopenhauer defined the

object constituted by the concept as, " abstract, discursive...attainable and

comprehensible to him that has only reason, communicable by words without any

other assistance, entirely exhausted by its definition.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#63:1> The concept, although immanent in and coextensive with language, is

capable of operating without the threat of a loss of content.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#64:1> The medium of transmission is thus viewed as adequate to the task of

communication.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#65:1> Be it in the realm of language or that of the visual, there is no

remainder.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#66:1> Goethe 's allegorical 'concept', " can be grasped and...had

completely...in the image."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#67:1> In the third part of his characterization Goethe writes: " It is

a big difference whether the poet looks for the particular in the general or

whether he sees the general in the particular.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#68:1> The literary critic and theorist Northrop Frye in Anatomy of

Criticism summarized the distinction of symbol and allegory as, " between a 'concrete'

approach to symbols which begins with images of actual things and works

outward to ideas and propositions, and 'abstract' approach which begins with

the idea and then tries to find concrete images to represent it.?
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#69:1> Although Frye fails to maintain the critical use of the terms 'concept'

and 'idea', his observation addresses an important issue in the relation of

the two modes to rational thought.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#70:1> The terms 'idea' and 'concept' correspond closely to the two modes of

reason widely discussed in German thought after Kant.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#71:1> The 'idea' emerges from synthetic reason ( i.e., Reason, or <foreign>

Vernunft </foreign> ) , while the 'concept' is produced by the machinations

of analytic reason ( Understanding, or <foreign> Verstand </foreign> ) .
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#72:1> For Kant and Hegel <foreign> Verstand </foreign> was a lower form of

cognition, one that merely formed the phenomenal world into categories

developed in relation to 'common sense'.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#73:1> To the understanding ( <foreign> Verstand </foreign> ) the phenomena

and objects of the world appear as isolated entities, unrelated to one

another except by general characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#74:1> Reason ( <foreign> Vernunft </foreign> ) , however, is capable of

comprehending 'higher' relationships between the objects of common

understanding, and for Hegel <foreign> Vernunft </foreign> was fundamentally

dialectical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#75:1> The symbol is thus found to be aligned with synthetic reason, a

reason involved with the reconciliation and sublation ( <foreign> Aufgehoben

</foreign> ) of antithetical conceptual pairs, or contradictory elements

within a greater totality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-007#76:1> As Hegel writes in his Encyclopaedia:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-007#77:1> The logical has in point of form three sides...These three sides

do not constitute three parts of the Logic, but are moments of each logical

reality, that is of each concept...a) Thought, as the Understanding, sticks

to finite determinacies and their distinctness from one another...b) The

dialectical moment of the self-sublation of such finite determinations and

their transition into their opposites...c) The speculative moment, or that of

positive Reason, apprehends the unity of the determinations in their

opposition--the affirmative that is contained in their dissolution and

transition.</p> </I>
