<p> Michael Jordan didn't shed any tears yesterday.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#2:1> Instead, he flashed a smile as bright as the sun, then walked away

from professional basketball at the height of his powers, recognized as

perhaps the most popular American sports figure in history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#3:1> The aftershocks were still rumbling across the landscape as

Jordan, 30, made it official, saying he had lost his desire to compete and

had no remaining goals now that he has won three consecutive world

championships.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#4:1> " He looked like the happiest man in the world," noted David

Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#5:1> Crushed last month by the murder of his father, James Jordan, and worn

down by his celebrity, Jordan offered no specific plans except to spend more

time with his family.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#6:1> " I have reached the pinnacle," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#7:1> " I feel like I don't have anything else to prove.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#8:1> David Falk, Jordan 's agent and close friend, predicted that the

retirement would be permanent.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#9:1> However, Jordan left broad hints that he might someday return, leading

to speculation that the world 's finest basketball player is actually on an

indefinite sabbatical.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#10:1> " I don't believe in never," he said when asked about a comeback.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#11:1> Pressed on the subject, he explained, " I'm just saying that fi 'm

years down the line, if the urge comes back, and if David Stern lets me back

in the league, I will come back.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#12:1> To which Stern responded, " My ears perked up when I heard him

mention five years.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#13:1> Right away, I wanted to negotiate him down to three.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#14:1> Jordan 's announcement was the low point of one of the darkest

days in Chicago sports history.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#15:1> Shortly thereafter, the Cubs fired manager Jim Lefebvre Despite their

third winning season in 23 years, and the White Sox lost the second game of

the American League playoffs to Toronto at Comiskey Park.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#16:1> Dressed impeccably, in a light green suit, Jordan was surrounded

at the announcement by many of the people who parlayed his talent and

charisma into a marketing effort that brought him an estimated

&dollar; 30 million annually on top of his

&dollar; 4 million Bulls salary.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#17:1> Part of Jordan 's legacy is that, in addition to revolutionizing

the sport, he has helped the NBA to spread basketball throughout the world,

while also generating untold millions for companies such as Nike that

succeeded in exploiting his video-friendly skills.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#18:1> Yesterday, even as Jordan was walking away from the NBA, there was

speculation that he would team up with Nike on an overseas venture in

basketball.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#19:1> Jordan 's talents transcended normal boundaries.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#20:1> " I used to say that this man was the Babe Ruth of basketball," Bulls

owner Jerry Reinsdorf said as he introduced Jordan yesterday.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#21:1> " I have now come to believe that Babe Ruth was the Michael Jordan of

baseball.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#22:1> " Really, across borders, I don't know who 's more famous than

Michael Jordan," said Stern.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#23:1> " He 's the most famous person in the world.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#24:1> Who else is there? There 's Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan and

Madonna.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#25:1> In the end, however, that notoriety threatened to engulf Jordan.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#26:1> His final season, immediately following his stint as leader of the

Olympic Dream Team, was the most difficult of his career, in large part

because of charges that he gambled excessively.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#27:1> Stern said yesterday that the commissioner 's office is still

investigating allegations by a former golf partner, Richard Esquinas, that

Jordan incurred gambling debts of more than

&dollar; 1.2 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#28:1> Stern said Jordan was scheduled to meet with him this week about

matters concerning the investigation.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#29:1> The meeting has been postponed, Stern said, but he added that the

investigation and Jordan 's retirement are unrelated.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#30:1> " One has nothing to do with the other," said Stern, who added

that it was Jordan who wanted to make sure that the meeting still took place

in order " to close the loop.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#31:1> Jordan has lashed out at the media for reporting on his gambling.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#32:1> During the Eastern Conference finals against the Knicks, he stopped

speaking for more than a week after it was reported that he spent time in an

Atlantic City casino on the eve of Game 2.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#33:1> However, he said yesterday that his decision, which came two days

before the Bulls are scheduled to open training camp, stemmed more from lack

of desire to compete than any other factor.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#34:1> " I always stressed to the people that have known me and have

followed me that when I lose that sense of motivation and that sense that I

can prove something, it 's time for me to leave," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#35:1> " It was just a matter of waiting until this time, when

basketball was near, to see if my heart ticked for it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#36:1> I went through all the different stages of getting myself prepared

for the next year, but the desire was not there.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#37:1> Jordan said he already " pretty much" had decided to retire

before his father was brutally murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#38:1> But he said the ordeal " made me realize how short life is .
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#39:1> .
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#40:1> .
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#41:1> I was already leaning in that direction, but it made it that much

simpler.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#42:1> " The biggest positive I can take out of my father not being here

with me today is that he saw my last basketball game," he added.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#43:1> " That means a lot.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#44:1> Jordan apparently had been contemplating retirement for a while.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#45:1> He first mentioned it to Reinsdorf last year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#46:1> This past season, he said frequently that he loved playing in ancient

Chicago Stadium and was less than enthralled about moving to a new arena

across the street for the 1994-95 season.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#47:1> On Sept. 17, Jordan appeared at a charity benefit with Reinsdorf

in Chicago and mentioned again that he was thinking seriously about

retiring.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#48:1> Reinsdorf told him to think about it, but Jordan reaffirmed his

plans, this time more forcefully, during a 3 1/2-hour meeting Sunday at

Falk 's house in Bethesda, Md.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#49:1> " It was very clear to me that I should not make any attempt to talk

him out of it," said Reinsdorf.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#50:1> " It would be a very dishonest thing on my part because I could not

honestly say that he should continue playing.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#51:1> I believe he should not continue playing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#52:1> The following day, Jordan walked into the Bulls offices and

announced it was over.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#53:1> " I asked Phil Jackson, the coach quite frankly, 'Is there anything I

have left to prove as a basketball player?' And he paused for a second.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#54:1> That 's all I needed to hear.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#55:1> Jordan had been true to his word.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#56:1> Shortly after the NBA Finals, during an interview for a soon-to-be

released photo-autobiography, he predicted that nothing would stop him when

he was ready to go.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#57:1> " I know there will be pressure on me to stay," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#58:1> " But that will be my opportunity to tell people why I played the

game.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#59:1> It 's never been for money and it 's never been for cheers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#60:1> " If you don't believe me, then just watch.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#61:1> And take a good look.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#62:1> Because one minute I'll be 'llre, and the next minute I'll be 'llgone.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-020#63:2> <H> Power given 8 to 12 years and warning;</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#64:2> <H> Globe staff writer Tom Coakley contributed to this report.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#65:2> BYLINE: By Patricia Nealon, Globe Staff

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#66:2> In a courtroom haunted with ghosts of the Vietnam era and heavy

with the pain of children who lost their father to a revolutionary action

gone horribly awry, Katherine A. Power was sentenced yesterday to 8 to 12

years in prison for her part in the 1970 Allston bank robbery in which Boston

Police Officer Walter A. Schroeder was killed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#67:2> Superior Court Judge Robert Banks, in an extraordinary move, also

warned Power that, once she is paroled after serving her term, she might be

sent back to prison for life should she try to profit from her role in the

celebrated case.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#68:2> During an emotional hearing in Suffolk Superior Court, the former

student revolutionary who drove the getaway car apologized forcefully,

tearfully - and briefly - for her role in the murder, saying she could not

find the words to express her sorrow for Schroeder 's death.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#69:2> Schroeder 's eldest daughter, Clare, meanwhile, found eight pages

of words, detailing her family 's two decades of loss and bitterly denouncing

Power as a member of an " armed criminal gang," whom time had transformed

into a celebrity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#70:2> " While Katherine Power was fleeing across the country - spending

the money she stole from the State Street Bank, smuggling sawed-off shotguns

through the St. Louis airport, and plotting to weld railroad cars to the

tracks to disrupt military shipments - my mother was burying my father in

Evergreen Cemetery," said Schroeder, a sergeant in the Waltham Police

Department and the oldest of Schroeder 's nine children.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#71:2> " While Katherine Power was establishing her new life in Oregon -

learning to cook, establishing a restaurant, and hunting game birds with her

husband - my mother was struggling every day to care for us, to provide for

us, and to give us a loving home . .. on a Boston police pension.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#72:2> Banks, too, had harsh words for Power as he imposed sentence.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#73:2> " I reject the proposition that your criminal activities were

justified, excused or even mitigated," Banks said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#74:2> " You were a criminal in every sense of the word.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#75:2> Clare Schroeder 's latest worry - that Power could make a " small

fortune," by selling her story - was allayed yesterday by Banks.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#76:2> In a unique addendum to Power 's sentence, Banks placed her on

probation for 20 years on one of two armed robbery charges with the proviso

that her probation would be revoked and she would be jailed for life if she

engaged in any activity that would permit her to profit from her crime.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#77:2> " I will not permit profit off the lifeblood of police officers ...
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#78:2> That is repugnant to me and I could not live with myself," said

Banks, who adopted the 8- to 12-year sentence recommended by Suffolk

Assistant District Attorney Walter Shea.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#79:2> Power will be eligible for parole after serving five years and four

months of the sentence.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#80:2> Power, a former Brandeis University honors student, still faces

one federal charge of theft of government property for her role in a raid on

a National Guard armory in Newburyport three days before the bank robbery.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#81:2> Federal prosecutors are expected to recommend a five-year sentence to

run concurrently with the state sentence she received yesterday when Power is

sentenced on Nov. 24.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#82:2> Her decision to surrender brought to an end 23 years on the run

for Power, who waited in a getaway car while fellow Brandeis student Susan

E.Saxe, former prison inmates Stanley Bond, then 25, and Robert J.Valeri,

then 21, robbed the Allston branch of the State Street Bank of

&dollar; 26,000 on Sept. 23, 1970, reportedly to finance revolutionary antiwar

activities.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#83:2> William ( Lefty) Gilday shot Schroeder in the back as he approached

the bank.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#84:2> The officer died the next day.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#85:2> Valeri confessed within hours.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#86:2> Gilday was captured within days after a shootout with police and is

serving a life sentence.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#87:2> Bond was arrested in a Colorado motel several days later.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#88:2> He died in 1972 when a bomb he was constructing in his prison cell in

Walpole exploded.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#89:2> But Saxe and Power went underground, sheltered in a feminist

underground network.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#90:2> They lived and worked in Connecticut and Pennsylvania until Saxe was

arrested on a Philadelphia street in 1975.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#91:2> After stopping in New Jersey to fashion a new identity - Power

settled on Alice L.Metzinger, the name of an infant who died shortly after

birth in 1949 - she headed to Oregon.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#92:2> There she started two restaurants, had a son, now 14, and married

Ronley Duncan last year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#93:2> Duncan, a slight man with a braided, gray-flecked ponytail, was in

court yesterday with their son, Jaime, whom he adopted last year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#94:2> " Katherine participated in a criminal act 23 years ago," Duncan

wrote in a letter to Banks.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#95:2> " But the Katherine I love and cherish is no criminal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#96:2> Power 's attorney, Rikki Klieman, had asked for a more lenient

sentence of 6 to 12 years, saying Power took full responsibility for her

actions and was penitent.
<ICE-USA:W2C-020#97:2> During her time in Oregon, Power had become " a woman of substance"

who cares for others and was charitable, Klieman said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#98:2> " But it must be unequivocally stated that Katherine Power is not

a hero and Katherine Power is an accomplice to a crime," Klieman said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#99:2> " No question about that," retorted Banks, who rejected

suggestions that Power suffered from clinical depression during her years as

a fugitive or that her actions were somehow excused by the tenor of the

times.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-020#100:2> Klieman had submitted more than 100 letters supporting a lenient

sentence, including one from Robert O.Muller, the executive director of the

Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, who asked for leniency " in the

spirit of reconciliation and healing.</p> </I>
