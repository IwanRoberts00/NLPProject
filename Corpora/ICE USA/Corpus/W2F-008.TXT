<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#3:1> Some people prop themselves on a moral high ground, passing

judgment until the Lord elects to contradict them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#4:1> Other people, well... they do what they gotta do. </p> <O> line</O>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#5:1> " Goddamn it, Gary," I said as I saw the news flash.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#6:1> I said it softly, silently even, to myself like a mother at her wit 's

end.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#7:1> Except I'm not his mother, I'm his wife.
<ICE-USA:W2F-00 'm8:1> I sometimes w 'mder if there 's a difference; sometimes I wonder if

there should be. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#9:1> I've been sitting here on the couch watch 've TV for an hour now,

waiting for the six o'clock news.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#10:1> I always watch the news, but a few minutes ago they came on and said

they're going to have a story about a ba 'rerobbery that happened really close

to where we live, only about a mile or two to the southeast, depending on how

it is you go, from where I'm sitting right now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#11:1> 'mere 's going to be this story, but all they've done so far is

describe this gu 'ves being tall, six-one or six-two, thick, collar-length

blonde hair and a mustache, late twenties, early thirties.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#12:1> Nothing real particular, your typical northern Michigan weekend bank

robber type.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#13:1> I've always had a weakness for that kin 'vef guy: a little bit of

trouble, nothing too dangerous, just enough to keep things interesting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#14:1> I guess it 's not so surprising then that Gary and I have been

together for so long.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#15:1> He 's exactly like that in the looks department.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#16:1> It 's close to three years now, married almost half that - - sixteen

months.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#17:1> But now I wonder what 's going to happen to us. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#18:1> We've been through a lot, Gary and m 've
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#19:1> Not all of it so good you'd tell your friends an 'dfamily about it,

but we've had good times and we've neve 'veone anything to hurt a 'vene else.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#20:1> Not on purpose anyway.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#21:1> At any rate, you can't even call it _real_ bank robbery.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#22:1> Just one drive through, two counter spots, and an ATM.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#23:1> Small time even as bank branches go.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#24:1> Whoever did it had an easy time of it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#25:1> But robbing banks is big time, no matter how small the bank, how

small the chunk of change you get.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#26:1> And you almost _always_ get caught. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#27:1> After the news we're supposed to go out to eat 're then to the

Fireplace Inn for a few drinks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#28:1> They have a great country band out there on the weekends.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#29:1> We're celebrating.
<ICE-USA:W2F 're8#30:1> Gary helped my brother with a sheet rock job and we finally have a

little bit of spending money.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#31:1> Things have been pretty tight since the money from the house ran out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#32:1> I was beginning to think we were going to have another fire, and I

could tell that Gary was thinking the same thing, saving all the extra papers

from the _Journal_ route that he runs Sunday mornings and all.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#33:1> That may sound kind of strange, but it 's happened before.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#34:1> We lost everything we owned that wasn't with us in the car.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#35:1> I have to admit that wasn't much, but even the little things add up

when you have to start from scratch.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#36:1> It 's not like we doused the house in gas and lit a match or anything.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#37:1> What we did was, we started stacking up old newspapers in front

of the furnace, and we let the lint build up in the dryer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#38:1> Little things that add up, you might say.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#39:1> That was when we were living in Saginaw, a couple of months after we

were married.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#40:1> Gary had lost his job working the oil rigs and things were looking

kind of bleak.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#41:1> I was really sad when he lost that job.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#42:1> Don't get me wrong, it wasn't because of the money, although it was

pretty rough being without it all of a sudden like that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#43:1> I was sad for romantic reasons.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#44:1> We had our wedding ceremony in a clearing in the middle of a

cornfield beside an operational rig.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#45:1> We had wanted to have it up on a platform tower, but we couldn't get

the preacher - - Deaconess, really; Sister LaTicia Wallace - - to climb up

there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#46:1> So we had to settle for the pump in the cornfield.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#47:1> But I'll never forget it.
<I 'llUSA:W2F-008#48:1> I'll always have a soft s 'll for oil derricks. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#49:1> We were clear across town visiting Gary 's mom and dad when we

heard about the fire.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#50:1> We rushed back home, fast as we could, but when we got there the fire

department had already put it out and there wasn't much left of it but a big

wet pile of stinking, steaming wood.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#51:1> The smell of smoke and ruin was in everything, you couldn't miss the

finality of it all.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#52:1> We moved into a trailer on Gary 's parents' lot and waited for the new

house to be built, brand spanking new and owned free and clear thanks to the

glories of a healthy insurance policy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#53:1> Insurance is the one thing Gary and I have always seemed to agree on.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#54:1> I may get a couple of months behind on my utilities, dodging the

shutoff notices and recorded messages and all, but my insurance premiums are

always paid on time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#55:1> That 's because Gary lost a house once before.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#56:1> Which means an accident here could stir up a lot of trouble and

questions from the insurance companies, what with two fires in less than a

year and another one only a few years before that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#57:1> Especially since the insurance was in my name on our last place and

it 's the same here.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#58:1> They'd start screamin 'darson so fast, whether they had any evidence

or not, which they wouldn't.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#59:1> There can't be evidence of arson if we didn't set the fire. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#60:1> So anyway, the news finally comes on and the anchor is describing

this guy and asking for anyone with any information regarding the robber to

call the station to let them know, and then they go to a commercial.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#61:1> For a second I get this scared feeling and look towards the bedroom,

but I put it out of my mind soon enough because I doubt they'll get any

call 'll
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#62:1> I don't see too many of us rushing out to inconvenience ourselves

over some small time crime that will get us little more than a court

appearance.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#63:1> Traverse may not be a really big city, yet, but it 's definitely a

place where people are smart enough to know that it 's better to wait for "

Missing/Reward" or " America 's Most Wanted", or one of those shows, because

at least then you know you're going to get 'reething out of the deal.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#64:1> I watch them both; I'm waiting for a cr 'me that I know something

about, but I suppose the chances of that are pretty darn slim.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#65:1> Basically, the community ethic/goodwill thing just doesn't cut it

anymore.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#66:1> It 's too easy to get hurt doing that trip. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#67:1> I had an uncle, Uncle Ryan, who got killed doing the good deed

activity.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#68:1> Uncle Ryan was a traveling salesman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#69:1> Bathroom fixtures.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#70:1> He was twisting his way through the mountains of southeastern

Kentucky when he got killed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#71:1> There are these signs down there, all throughout the mountains that

say " Fallen Rock Zone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#72:1> They used to have signs that said " Watch For Falling Rocks", except

you never see any rocks actually falling, and people were spending more time

looking for the damn things to fall than they were looking at the road.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#73:1> I guess that 's why they made the change.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#74:1> Anyway, Uncle Ryan actually saw a rock in the road.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#75:1> Now, just because people don't actually see the rocks fall doesn't

mean that they don't.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#76:1> There are rocks the size of Yugos and all sorts of smaller boulders

all along the sides of the roads.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#77:1> It 's just that you don't see these things _in_ the road.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#78:1> Well, Uncle Ryan sees this rock and his first inclination is that

someone is going to get hurt with that rock being in the other lane like that

and there being a blind curve right there and no real way for oncoming

traffic to see the rock, so Uncle Ryan pulls his car off to the side of the

road as far as he can and he gets out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#79:1> He walks over, bends down, grabs hold of the rock and starts to lift

it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#80:1> He had enough time to get halfway up with it when a huge coal hauler

came hurtling around that blind curve Uncle Ryan was so concerned about and

hit him dead center on the grill.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#81:1> Four days later we had a closed casket ceremony and to this day I'm

convinced 'mat it simply doesn't pay to go out of your way to help someone

else if there 's nothing in it for you.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#82:1> That may be a hard thing to say, but I tend to think that these are

hard times. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#83:1> I'm waiting till 'mfter the news to wake Gary up.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#84:1> He 's sleeping in the other room.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#85:1> I should wake him up and make him watch the news with me, see what he

says, but I need time to think.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#86:1> And he needs his rest, though how he can sleep I'll never k 'll.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#87:1> He picked up a quarter pound of weed from my brother-in-law who lives

just down the road on the street behind ours.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#88:1> The dope 's mainly to sell, of course, but we usually skim off half an

ounce or so.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#89:1> Once it 's all divided up, no one notices.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#90:1> Still, I have to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't take too

much.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#91:1> I have to keep reminding him that it 's an investment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#92:1> You have to be responsible where investments are concerned.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#93:1> Sometimes I think love is a lot like baby-sitting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#94:1> But that 's okay.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#95:1> Love should be a burden.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#96:1> I've alw 've thought that, at least for as long as I've fel 've know

what love is. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#97:1> My mom knew real love.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#98:1> Love was never easy for her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#99:1> I mean, maybe at one time it was, but not that I can remember.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#100:1> My dad had Multiple Sclerosis, and it was hard on mother the last

few years of his life.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#101:1> He had gone virtually blind and was in a wheelchair; he used to say

over and over, " I ain't a baby, I can do it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#102:1> He said it about everything we tried to do for him, but, of course,

he couldn't.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#103:1> He'd we 'd himself out trying, and then sit there quiet with his eyes

all wet looking while Mom or one of us kids helped him out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#104:1> He had been a policeman and had always been active.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#105:1> The MS didn't really start affecting him till he was in his early

thirties.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#106:1> My brother and sister and I were all very young.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#107:1> By the time I was ten or eleven, it seemed like he had always been

in that wheelchair.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#108:1> His speech got to be real difficult to understand as well.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#109:1> He'd ge 'dupset over it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#110:1> I can't blame him, now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#111:1> I hate having to repeat myself, and my speech is perfectly clear.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#112:1> Mom had to take care of him like he was a child.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#113:1> And with three little kids running around on top of it all, it was

hard on her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#114:1> That 's how I know what love is all about, how it has to be a burden

to be real. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#115:1> When I first met Gary I was working at a country bar called The

Roundup, a little north of Thompsonville.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#116:1> He was up fishing along the Platte River and had been driving around

looking for a place to get a steak and have a few beers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#117:1> The Roundup is about the most perfect place around for that sort of

thing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#118:1> Anyway, I was serving him, and I guess I must have been pretty

obvious, bending over and letting him have a peek or two at the goods, and

other tricks I still haven't been able to stop using since I did a little

time as a prostitute.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#119:1> Down in Detroit.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#120:1> I left that all behind.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#121:1> It 's been practically fifteen years now since I got out of that

life. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-008#122:1> It 's weird when I think back on it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#123:1> It hurts, too.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#124:1> Sometimes I want to cry over it, like a black secret I'm 'mlways

trying to hide from the rest of the world.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#125:1> I didn't do it for long, but it was too long just the same.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#126:1> I don't even know how it happened.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#127:1> I mean, I do, but I have a hard time believing I ever did it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#128:1> I was in the Navy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#129:1> I had a good job working as a missile mechanic, which I also can't

believe I ever did.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#130:1> I only joined to get my GED and because I couldn't find a job.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#131:1> Anyway, one night I went out with a guy I met at a bar and we got to

partying.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#132:1> I was gone the whole weekend, went AWOL, and I was afraid to go

back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#133:1> I couldn't call home.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#134:1> I needed money and it seemed like an easy enough way of getting

some.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#135:1> Next thing I knew I was dishonorably discharged and sitting on a bus

back to Michigan.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#136:1> I went right back to it in Detroit.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#137:1> I got into all sorts of other bad things, too, including smack.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#138:1> As far as I know there 's still an outstanding warrant for my arrest

there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#139:1> For loitering of all things.
<ICE-USA:W2F-008#140:1> That 's what they bust you for when they can't get you on anything

else. </p> </I>
