<I>
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#1:1> <h> Dear IBM Investor</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#2:1> When I wrote to you a year ago, the global economy was

experiencing profound disruption.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#3:1> The financial system was freezing up.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#4:1> Many companies and entire industries were pulling in their horns,

hoping simply to ride out the storm.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#5:1> IBM 's own industry was no different. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#6:1> Nonetheless, I said that we felt confident heading into 2009.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#7:1> We were entering the year strong, and we expected to exit it stronger.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#8:1> A year later, despite an environment that remains very

challenging, I am happy to report that your company has continued to

outperform our industry and the market at large.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#9:1> We delivered strong results in 2009, once again achieving record

pre-tax earnings, record earnings per share and record free cash flow despite

reduced revenues.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#10:1> At the same time, we continued to deliver superior returns to you,

our owners.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#11:1> Most importantly, we are well positioned to grow as the economy

begins to recover. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#12:1> The explanation for this performance and for our optimism about

both the near-term and the longer-term future is threefold.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#13:1> It rests, first, on the ongoing transformation of our company;

second, on our focused strategy to capture the large opportunity of a

globally integrating world; and third, on a business model that reliably

generates strong profits and cash, giving us the financial flexibility to

invest for future growth. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#14:1> I will talk about each of these factors in detail in this letter.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#15:1> It is important for you to understand the ways in which IBM today is

a very different company than it was just a few years ago.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#16:1> This repositioning explains why we have demonstrated such stability

and strong results during this downturn and why we believe we will benefit as

the economy recovers and growth returns. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#17:1> Two thousand nine was a tough year by any measure, but IBM 's

performance was indicative both of our high-value market position and of the

discipline we apply to our strategy and operations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#18:1> Since the dot-com crash in 2002, we have added

&dollar;12 billion to IBM 's pre-tax profit base, increased our pre-tax margin 2.5

times, quadrupled our earnings per share and more than doubled our free cash

flow.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#19:1> Cumulatively, we have generated about

&dollar;80 billion of free cash flow. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#20:1> Our strong 2009 continued this record of superior performance:

IBM 's gross profit margin rose for the sixth consecutive year to 45.7

percent, up 9.2 points since 2003.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#21:1> Our pre-tax income margin rose to 18.9 percent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#22:1> Both margins are at their highest in more than a decade.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#23:1> We achieved this by driving productivity and continuing to shift our

business mix to more profitable segments.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#24:1> Once again, more than 90 percent of our segment profit in 2009 was

from software, services and financing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#25:1> We have continued to achieve strong EPS growth.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#26:1> Last year was another record, with diluted earnings per share of

&dollar;10.01, up 13 percent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#27:1> This marked seven straight years in which we have grown EPS by double

digits. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#28:1> IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow, a key indicator

of real business performance.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#29:1> In 2009 our free cash flow, excluding the year-to-year change in

Global Financing receivables, was

&dollar;15.1 billion, an increase of

&dollar;800 million from 2008.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#30:1> IBM ended 2009 with

&dollar;14 billion of cash and marketable securities. </p> S<p><ICE-USA:W1B-022#>Since the dot-com

crash in 2000, we have added

&dollar;12 billion to IBM 's pre-tax profit base and increased our pre-tax margin .5

times, our earnings per share by 4 times and free cash flow more than

doubled. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#31:1> Our revenue was

&dollar;95.8 billion, down 5 percent at constant currency.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#32:1> Nonetheless, in 2009 we grew pre-tax income from continuing

operations by 9 percent, to

&dollar;18.1 billion, our highest ever.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#33:1> Our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business

and to generate substantial returns to investors.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#34:1> Our 2009 cash investment was

&dollar;1.2 billion for six acquisitions five of them in key areas of software.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#35:1> And after investing

&dollar;5.8 billion in R&D and

&dollar;3.7 billion in net capital expenditures, we were able to return more than

&dollar;10 billion to you

&dollar;7.4 billion through share repurchase and

&dollar;2.9 billion through dividends.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#36:1> Last year 's dividend increase was 10 percent, marking the 14th year

in a row in which we have raised our dividend. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#37:1> In sum, with our excellent financial position, strong balance

sheet, solid recurring revenue, strong profit streams and unmatched global

reach, we are confident about the year ahead, and beyond.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#38:1> Indeed, we achieved our 2010 objective of

&dollar;10 to

&dollar;11 in earnings per share one year early.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#39:1> We believe that we will again grow EPS by double digits this year,

reaching at least

&dollar;11. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#40:1> Today, many of our competitors are emulating our moves.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#41:1> For instance, several have gone on an acquisition binge to get into

new spaces.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#42:1> However, there is a vast difference between what your company has

done amassing truly differentiating technology and skills, and focusing on

the needs of enterprise clients and what others are doing, largely to

compensate for rapidly commoditizing business models. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#43:1> As the new decade begins, some in our industry still seem to

believe that history will repeat itself, for example, that clients will

invest in IT simply because of product upgrade cycles.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#44:1> Once again, we have a different view.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#45:1> We believe that clients will only invest in what delivers compelling,

quantifiable business value.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#46:1> We believe that the fundamental shifts I described earlier will

continue to play out, and that they create a unique opportunity for IBM.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#47:1> And because of the way we have managed the company during the

economic downturn, we have the flexibility to take advantage of this

opportunity, and to invest for growth.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#48:1> Our investments in 2010 are focused on four high-potential

opportunities.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#49:1> IBM has among the broadest global footprints of any corporation or

institution.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#50:1> We serve clients in more than 170 countries around the world, and we

have been deeply established within myriad local economies and cultures for

decades. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#51:1> Our Growth Markets unit, established in 2008, is helping to

capture the highest-growth opportunities of the world 's emerging economies.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#52:1> Since 2005, these markets have expanded their contribution to IBM 's

geographic revenue by a point a year, growing at least 8 points faster than

major markets over the last three years. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#53:1> Going forward, both mature and emerging markets are building out

and integrating their physical and digital infrastructures, and infusing the

resulting systems with intelligence.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#54:1> More than

&dollar;2 trillion in fiscal stimulus has already been earmarked by governments

around the world.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#55:1> We are uniquely positioned to benefit from these large business and

technology opportunities, and we are pursuing them aggressively in 2010. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#56:1> Data is being captured today as never before both from the

so-called Internet of Things ( heading toward trillions of connected objects)

and from hundreds of millions of individuals using social media.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#57:1> In just three years, IP traffic is expected to total more than half a

zettabyte.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#58:1> ( That 's a trillion gigabytes ( or 1 followed by 21 zeroes.) And this

data no longer consists merely of text and numbers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#59:1> It includes rich media of all kinds, from video and audio, to images,

avatars, simulations and applications.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#60:1> Thirty percent of the data in the world today consists of medical

images alone. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#61:1> All this information-the knowledge of the world, the flow of

markets, the pulse of societies-can now be turned into insight through

sophisticated mathematical models, also known as analytics.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#62:1> Where once we inferred, now we know.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#63:1> Where once we interpolated and extrapolated, now we can determine.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#64:1> The historical is giving way to the real-time, and even the

predictive. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#65:1> IBM is moving quickly to capitalize on this promise.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#66:1> We have built the industry 's premier analytics practice, with 4,000

consultants, mathematicians and researchers, as well as leading-edge software

capabilities bolstered by key acquisitions such as Cognos and SPSS.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#67:1> Our new Business Analytics and Optimization service line targets the

highest-growth opportunities by delivering integrated analytics solutions

based on the needs of specific industries. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#68:1> As our planet becomes instrumented, interconnected and

intelligent, the computing model is evolving to support it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#69:1> Think of it as the industrialization of IT.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#70:1> Over the past generation, our digital infrastructures have become

very complex and inefficient, so now we're 'reimizing them through

automation, creating systems that are highly tuned to the specific workloads

they run and to new consumption and delivery models, such as clouds. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#71:1> Thus, the data center is shifting from being a single physical

place to something more like the Internet, a diverse set of services fueled

by IT.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#72:1> This provides far more choice and flexibility, which is of particular

interest to the many businesses and governments that want simply to consume

some services they once built, maintained and provided themselves.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#73:1> It also makes possible things that were not previously so, such as

modeling systemic risk or creating integrated healthcare records. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#74:1> However, with these new possibilities come new challenges, in

areas such as security.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#75:1> As a result, our clients are seeking help in architecting and

building a new kind of highly efficient infrastructure that is reliable and

secure, even as it integrates services from a variety of external

sources.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#76:1> We have invested billions of dollars in R&D and acquisitions to

build leadership in two key dimensions of this new IT model: service

management software and optimized systems.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#77:1> We have also established a portfolio of cloud services that clients

can access externally from IBM or offer internally to users on their own

premises.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#78:1> And because of IBM 's track record of integrating new technology

paradigms like open source and the Internet into the enterprise, we have

earned the trust of clients and the industry to bring reliability and

security to what is new. </p> W<p><ICE-USA:W1B-022#>We are seeing smarter systems being

implemented in every major industry and across every region of both the

developed and developing worlds.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#79:1> And they are creating measurable economic and societal value.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#80:1> All of these growth strategies come together in the opportunity we

call " smarter planet." This is not a metaphor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#81:1> It describes the infusion of intelligence into the way the world

actually works, the way that almost anything-any person, any object, any

process or any service, for any organization, large or small, can now become

digitally aware, networked and intelligent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#82:1> This means that industries, infrastructures, processes, cities and

entire societies can be more productive, efficient and responsive. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#83:1> We developed this agenda and strategic initiative in the summer

of 2008, and we launched it that autumn at the peak of the economic crisis.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#84:1> We did so because we believed it represented a pragmatic way to

address the very problems that were transfixing the world. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#85:1> After just a year, it is clear that our belief was correct.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#86:1> The idea of " smarter systems" is resonating with decision-makers in

both the private and public sectors.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#87:1> We are seeing these systems being implemented in every major industry

and across every region of both the developed and developing worlds.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#88:1> And they are creating measurable economic and societal value. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#89:1> In a study of 439 cities, those that employ smarter

transportation solutions-including ramp metering, signal coordination and

incident management-reduced travel delays on average by more than 700,000

hours annually. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#90:1> Eight hospitals and 470 primary care clinics in Spain implemented

smarter healthcare systems across their facilities and improved clinical

results and operational efficiency by up to 10 percent. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#91:1> Banks and other financial services organizations around the world

are achieving new levels of risk control, efficiency and customer service.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#92:1> For instance, payment processing costs at the Bank of Russia have

been reduced by 95 percent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#93:1> And CLS Bank now handles most of the world 's currency exchange

transactions, securely eliminating the risk from trades worth

&dollar;3.5 trillion per day, and growing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#94:1> Four leading retailers have reduced supply chain costs by up to

30 percent, reduced inventory levels by up to 25 percent, and increased sales

up to 10 percent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#95:1> They'v 'veone so by analyzing customer buying behaviors, aligning

merchandising assortments with demand and building end-to-end visibility

across their entire supply chain. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#96:1> This list could go on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#97:1> We are quantifying the outcomes of hundreds and hundreds of smarter

systems, and this measurable value gives leaders everywhere the confidence to

try something new. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#98:1> The opportunity to make our planet smarter is both real and

inspiring.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#99:1> It has excited forward-thinking leaders in industry, government and

across civil society in both mature and growth markets.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#100:1> Encouragingly, but not surprisingly, it has also energized IBMers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#101:1> Over nearly a century, IBM 's greatest achievements have arisen from

our distinctive culture and values. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#102:1> This is why, despite the current economic climate, I am

optimistic about IBM 's prospects to lead the era we are now entering.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#103:1> Underneath the surface turmoil, this moment presents a rich and

transformational opportunity.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#104:1> Everywhere around the world, people are eager for change.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#105:1> And every day, more and more forward-thinking leaders are creating

tangible outcomes and benefits, making their parts of our planet smarter.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#106:1> Like IBMers, they recognize that we cannot wait, cannot let this

moment pass.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#107:1> They know the time to act is now.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#108:1> And the way to act is together. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-022#109:1> Let me close by expressing my pride in the 400,000 women and men

of the global IBM team who have brought us to this point.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#110:1> And let me express my gratitude to you, our shareholders, for your

unwavering support.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#111:1> I hope that you are pleased with how your company is performing and

evolving.
<ICE-USA:W1B-022#112:1> And I trust that you share our excitement about the role we can play

in what promises to be a new epoch for our industry, for business and for our

planet.</p> S<ICE-USA:W1B-022#><h><@>Sidney Jones</@>
