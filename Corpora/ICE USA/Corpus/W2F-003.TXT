<ICE-USA:W2F-003#1:1> 1. STILL DRINKING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS</h> <h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#2:1> by Ivan Gold</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#3:1> Jason Sams, in danger of losing his job ( not ready to admit it

was already lost), deemed it high time to return to the literary wars.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#4:1> It was 1976, year of the tall ships, two hundredth anniversary of the

nation 's founding; impossible to ignore ( in Boston, in March) signs of

impending celebration, but the prospect of pervasive pageantry depressed him

less than the knowledge that his best efforts were unlikely to keep the

Englishwoman from finessing him out of the job.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#5:1> He was entering his eighth year of marriage, father of one and author

of two ( in marked contrast to Fiona, divorced dam of seven, perpetrator of

six), forty-three and intermittently aware that alcohol had become less

useful to him than once it had been, at some indeterminate period in his

life.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#6:1> He knew there might well come a day ( comfortably in the future) when

he would elect to give it up entirely. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#7:1> ( And once he returned from New York, where he must venture soon

to talk up his new book, as yet barely on the drawing board, he intended to

put together an extended piece of abstinence, long enough to launch, at

least, the project that would signal his return.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#8:1> Even the impending loss of livelihood was less disturbing than the

recollection of how nice he'd been to h 'd in the dog days following her

arrival in July of ' 75, when no one in authority had been in town, let alone

on campus, and ( fresh off the plane) she'd called hi 'dfrom the Creative

Writing Department office, to which she'd taxied di 'dctly from Logan, and

burst into tears right on the phone in her confusion and loneliness. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#9:1> Delighted to be summoned from whatever it was he had been doing,

moved further when he laid eyes on her ( about ten years his senior, no harm

in that; his cock and he much taken by her earthy, ample, Colleen Dewhurst

qualities), Jason saw her settled into the nearby Howard Johnson motel and

then helped her, over the next few weeks, find a university-owned apartment

not far from his own.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#10:1> He squired her to neighborhood pubs, gave her a hand moving in when

her stuff finally arrived, and when her back went out he drove her to and

from the supermarket in his beatup Valiant and finally to his own house for

dinner, carefully arranging the pillows and extra chair on which she might

prop up her leg ( for he knew better than to underestimate a bad back, even

if she didn't), setting her up in his own favorite chair at the head of his

table in a manner that recalled to him both his grandfathers, or any

imperious patriarch presiding at a seder.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#11:1> His wife, battered by years of proximity to his habits, still wildly

hopeful that their " new life" in Boston would bring new meaning to their

lives, busted her butt in the kitchen and turned out a masterpiece, a

flawless novella of a four-course meal.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#12:1> His four-year-old son said impossibly witty, insightful things at

dinner, and otherwise ( incredibly) behaved himself, when he might just as

easily have staged a repetition of the antics that had sent John Cheever

scurrying into the night the previous academic year.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#13:1> But Fiona managed to ignore the kid and even had the balls to send

the chicken tarragon back to the kitchen for fine tuning, while blowing

literary smoke Jason 's way, and framing keen questions about the head of the

English Department and other notables ( to which, long since smashed on his

own Chivas and his own Bordeaux, Sams returned - - callow fucker that he

was-- keen and humorous and self-compromising answers). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#14:1> Nevertheless he drove her home and turned her over to her doorman

in the posher quarters she had found by then, in genteelly seedy Brookline

Towers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#15:1> He remained at her disposal through August and into September of

1975; by late September the bigwigs were in place and the new term began, and

as the visiting star-for-a-year she seemed to have settled in from the

beginning, socially and pedagogically, for he heard nothing further from her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#16:1> A victim ( all his lousy life!) of misplaced compassion, Sams finally

felt, by mid-December, her ill wind blowing through the fog, adding its

particular peril to the boozy miasma in which he passed his days. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#17:1> The limey son-of-a-bitch! Himself once the visiting star for a

single semester ( filling in for a distinguished drunk who began academic

year ' 73-74, taught a class or two, then vanished), he was now in his second

year of discharging the duties of backup person to the hotshot of the moment,

a safe ( he had thought), reasonably well-compensated, untaxing gig he would

have been content to continue for as long as they would have him or until his

ship came in, whichever was soonest; but Fiona was after it now, and not (

from what he'd further 'dard) from love of teaching or a need for money but

because she'd fallen f 'd some West Indian poet putz and needed the promise of

a job in order to renew her visa; what could be simpler than to go after some

version of the position she already held, stepping with Ms.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#18:1> Dewhurst 's own terrible grace over whatever bodies might litter the

road?
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#19:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#20:1> Not without resources, Sams primed himself with a few pops of

Jack Daniels and a Rignes beer and got on the blower to the New York Times.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#21:1> They accomodated him with three first novels to review.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#22:1> He was sick and tired of writing book reviews, even ( or especially)

for the Sunday New York Times, but the point now was to see to it that the

brief bio accompanying the ephemera contained not only his literary bona

fides but also a thunderous plug for the half-ass creative writing program (

as weren't they all) in the half-ass university that was about to discharge

him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#23:1> This much unfolded as planned: " Jason Sams, the author of Just

Desserts, a book of stories, and Slow Dying, a novel..." was further

described as Visiting Lecturer in Creative Writing ( Fiction) in the Graduate

Creative Writing Program at the University of Greater Boston, and in the days

after his review appeared the doddering Shakespearean scholar took to nodding

at him in the hallway, and the philologist who specialized in New England

place names allowed that he hadn't read a novel in thirty years, and Sams'

omnibus pan had done little to alter his habits.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#24:1> Surely someone in the administration or at least high up in the

English Department must have seen it too, and too bad his class of six that

semester was totally uninspired, or he would have solicited testimonials from

some or all of them regarding his preternatural ability to elicit the best

prose ( fiction) they had to offer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#25:1> But to a man ( and one snide woman) they were obtuse and talent-free,

so he let that aspect go. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#26:1> In mid-February the Joycean scholar who chaired the English

Department, new to the position and also to the U of GB, suggested lunch.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#27:1> Jason accepted, recommending a frugal Greek place in the square, not

far from where he lived.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#28:1> Between the chairman 's invitation and their meeting a week later a

Sunday New York Times appeared, and there on the cover of the Book Review was

Fiona, Visiting Professor in the Graduate Creative Writing etc., assessing

Doris Lessing at considerable length.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#29:1> The Times had to have bumped someone else to have given her the new

Lessing on such short notice; holy shit ( if he had doubted it before), was

he ever overmatched! He thought he might share this rueful insight with the

chairman over lunch, while not neglecting to make his own strong case for

keeping the job: he was ( unlike the Englishwoman) an experienced teacher of

the unteachable, had done the thing at Columbia University and at Bard

College before arriving at the U of GB, and ( not that this necessarily

mattered, nor did contemplation of it always bring him pleasure) could point

to moderately successful young writers publishing out there at this moment

who had obviously benefited from his guidance. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#30:1> He would of course endeavor to steer clear of the fact ( although

it informed their every word to each other) that he and the chairman had

known each other for almost twenty-five years, and that the chairman had

written a delighted review of Jason 's first book some thirteen years earlier

for ( of all places) the Sunday New York Times.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#31:1> Now married to a young woman who had been his student at the

university he had recently been lured from, father by his first marriage of

two teenaged boys he saw every other weekend ( his ex-wife taught English at

Radcliffe), the chairman had aged well, retaining all his curly locks (

unlike the thin-topped Sams), a becoming salt-and-pepper now, as was his

neatly-trimmed beard; had published two collections of scholarly essays with

university presses and was readying a third; to Jason ( who had read all

their mentor 's fiction and nonfiction with considerable profit and pleasure),

the chairman 's work seemed to owe a great deal to Lionel Trilling 's, while

managing to sidestep entirely the master 's readability.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#32:1> Sams had not loved the chairman, as he still loved a few of the

friends he'd m 'de way back then, and in fact had not known him all that well

during their undergraduate years.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#33:1> But they had been at Columbia at the same time, shared whatever the

class of ' 53 had shared, and beyond that were both New Yorkers, from

orthodox Jewish backgrounds long since repudiated, and so the present

situation, the chairman inheriting both Jason and his problems, was indeed

perhaps a trifle fraught, as Trilling might have said, although not nearly as

fraught, in Sams' opinion, as the chairman, with his love of complex Jewish

suffering, liked to make it appear. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#34:1> In the beginning, while Sams still attended faculty functions (

for the free booze, and for the opportunity - - which eluded him always-- of

advancing his career), the chairman would seek him out and drape an arm

across his shoulders and say to whatever third party happened to be passing,

" You see this guy?
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#35:1> He 's one hell of a short story writer!"
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#36:1> ( The chairman had not been enamored of Sams' novel, but neither, for

that matter, had been Trilling, or the New York Times.) " We were classmates

at Columbia, can you beat it?
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#37:1> We even took Trilling 's Austen-Dickens-Wordsworth course together!

And he wrote well then! 'Silent Generation' my foot, eh Jace?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#38:1> With these facts and opinions public record, any temptation toward

favoritism the chairman might have felt was clearly compromised, and at that

point, if he judged the company receptive, and even if not, the chairman

would fire off a brand new Jewish joke, which invariably glazed Jason 's eyes

and strained the corners of his mouth, while he wondered what idle nincompoop

continued to grind the damn things out, and how the chairman managed to have

instant access to them. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#39:1> I' 'veknown this guy forever ( Jason heard), and now that you know

it you can rest assured I won't be doing him any favors.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#40:1> In these corrupt times, in this city corrupter than most, in this

university corruptest of all, led by an iron-fisted president ( with a palace

guard of wildeyed satraps) who summarily dismisses his enemies and appoints

his cronies to high administrative posts and what is worse does not scruple

to anoint anyone who strikes his fancy a " professor" and inflict same at

budget-busting ratesd on some unsuspecting department head ( and you may rest

assured I will resign my chairmanship and my position both before I allow

such a thing to happen in my purview), all the while shooting off his mouth

with an incredible mixture of chutzpah and cant about the need for

belt-tightening and the quest for something he calls " excellence," some few

of us with the means to do so must combat the prevailing tone. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#41:1> Jason was with him up to here ( although there were times he

found himself wishing that the president and his handpicked band of merry

psychopaths didn't scare the shit out of him, and that he and all the

powerful freaks had somehow come to be fast friends), but did such

scrupulosity mean you had to bend way back the other way and give the shaft

to people you knew, whose work ( if nothing else) you once respected in a

former life?
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#42:1> Hah, lansman?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#43:1> Was it so written in the Talmud?
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#44:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#45:1> The chairman was an inch or two taller than Jason, and ( even had

he not been wearing the expensive tweed topcoat) considerably broader;

couldn't blame him for these physical advantages, but who else was there to

hold responsible for the writer 's weird feeling of being bested from the

start?
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#46:1> " Dutch treat?" the chairman said as he walked up, ushering Jason

into the restaurant.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#47:1> To the employee it was an ill omen, although he had chosen this

particular place to guard against just such eventuality.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#48:1> This was not New York, he was not lunching with a publisher or some

other seeker after his favor, he would not be starting off with a martini (

which he never otherwise drank), getting ready to be courted.
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#49:1> Would such a wooing, he wondered, ever befall him again?
<ICE-USA:W2F-003#50:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-003#51:1> Minus ( unthinkably!) booze, the chances were, if so. </p> </I>
