<ICE-USA:W2A-040#9:1> <h> Introduction </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#10:1> Cosmic rays were first discovered because of the dogged curiosity

of one man to explain a minor scientific irritation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#11:1> The study of radioactive materials in the period from 1898 to 1912

was of widespread interest because this field offered direct insight into the

nature of the atom, whose structure was still unknown.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#12:1> Electrometers were often used to measure the very small flux of

particles coming from radioactive materials.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#13:1> ( An electrometer consists of two thin ribbons of metal suspended in

a vacuum bulb, which diverge when charge is present.)
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#14:1> In use, electrometer readings had to be corrected for " leakage,"

which was dependent on the electrometer size and proportional to time, but

remarkably was not dependent on the amount of charge on the electrometer

foils.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#15:1> This leakage led to speculation about possible undiscovered

radioactive contamination, or a flux of new invisible ether particles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#16:1> Victor Hess studied this phenomenon by taking electrometers onto

lakes where there should have been less contamination ( no change in leakage)

and into caves ( leakage disappeared).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#17:1> Finally, in 1912, he brilliantly solved the problem by lifting two

ion chambers in balloons to altitudes of 6 km ( Figure 1) [ 1, 2].
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#18:1> He showed that there was indeed a flux of particles, and that it came

from the sky with an intensity which increased with altitude ( he was awarded

the 1936 Nobel Prize for this work).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#19:1> His work was immediately followed by more detailed studies such as

that of Kolhorster, who showed that the particle flux increased very rapidly

with altitude, with a 10X increase at only 10 km.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#20:1> Cosmic rays became the source of wild speculation for the next twenty

years because of their exponential increase in flux with height.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#21:1> Finally, Pfotzer showed in 1936 that the flux did not continue to

increase but reached a peak at about 15 km, after which it diminished rapidly

[ 3] [ Figure l(c)].
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#22:1> All of this early work is directly related to the prediction of

integrated circuit ( IC) soft fails at terrestrial altitudes and at airplane

altitudes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#23:1> Because of the wide speculation about the nature of cosmic rays (

a name introduced by the popular press about 1914), there is no single

scientific definition of the phrase, only the popular description: Things

which rain down from the heaven and are not wet.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#24:1> The scientific literature has adopted three variations on the phrase:

primary cosmic rays, the initial particle flux external to the earth 's

atmosphere; cascade cosmic rays, the intermediate flux within the atmosphere;

and sea-level cosmic rays, the final terrestrial flux of particles. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#25:1> <h> Outline of methodology </H>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#26:1> This paper evaluates the terrestrial cosmic ray flux at various

cities to facilitate the prediction of cosmic-rayinduced electronic soft

fails [ 4].
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#27:1> The cosmic particles which cause soft fails fall into the class of

particles called hadrons, which interact with the strong interaction ( also

called the nuclear force), specifically neutrons, protons, and pions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#28:1> Experimental values of the flux of all of these particles have never

been measured for any single terrestrial site.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#29:1> Therefore, scattered measurements taken over 50 years must be

combined with theoretical estimates of variability to obtain a single

benchmark cosmic sealevel flux, the cosmic flux datum, which was arbitrarily

chosen to be that at New York City.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#30:1> Other experiments and theoretical calculations will scale this datum

flux to other terrestrial cities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#31:1> The topics of this paper are presented in the following order:
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#32:1> 1.External particle flux-A discussion of the external incident cosmic

ray particle flux into the earth 's outer atmosphere, and how it changes with

time. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#33:1> 2.Cascades in the atmosphere-None of these external incident

particles survive to reach the earth 's surface because of the density of the

atmosphere and the strength of the strong interaction.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#34:1> Each incident particle creates a cascade of secondary particles,

which in turn creates further cascades.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#35:1> The details of the cascades are complicated because many high-energy

particles decay spontaneously, with half-lives of less than a nanosecond.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#36:1> A cascade calculation is used which gives flux spectra for all

significant particles ( including all hadrons) in the lower atmosphere.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#37:1> This calculation generates the shapes of the sea-level particle flux

spectra ( differential flux versus particle energy).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#38:1> These shapes are then normalized using the available experimental

data. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#39:1> 3. Altitude corrections-The results of the above particle cascade

calculations are used to obtain snapshots of the cascades at various

altitudes in order to establish scaling rules which correct experimental flux

measurements taken at various terrestrial altitudes to a common sea-level

datum. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#40:1> 4. Geomagnetic corrections The earth 's magnetic field deflects

cosmic rays and significantly modifies the terrestrial flux.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#41:1> Calculations of these terrestrial variations are used to normalize

cosmic flux measurements taken at various geographic locations to equivalent

fluxes at New York City. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#42:1> 5.NYC sea-level flux datum- The above steps establish the New

York City sea-level flux datum, with experimental measurements taken at

different locations and at different altitudes being normalized to a common

point.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#43:1> No correction for solar cycle is made because the scatter of data is

much larger than the effects of the solar cycle. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#44:1> 6.Flux intensities for cities The cosmic ray flux at many other

cities is evaluated on the basis of their latitude, longitude, and altitude.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#45:1> An appendix tabulates the results for many cities with populations

above 500 000 or isolated sites with extensive electronic systems ( e.g.,

Kinshasa, Zaire, or Leadville, Colorado). </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#46:1> <h> Primary cosmic ray flux </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#47:1> There are two sources of primary cosmic ray particles: First,

there is a flux of very energetic particles from distant sources in the

galaxy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#48:1> There is also the flood of low-energy particles called the solar

wind, which disappears during the period of the quiet sun, and then builds

into a torrential storm of particles during an active sun period.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#49:1> These two particle currents are initially considered separately. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#50:1> <h> Galactic flux</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#51:1> The galactic cosmic rays are of debatable origin, and there are

no theoretical estimates of the primary flux.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#52:1> Some have energies beyond 10^sup 23^ eV, so exotic scenarios have

been proposed for their origin, such as being accelerated by stellar flares,

supernova explosions, pulsar spin-offs, or from the explosions of nascent

galactic nuclei.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#53:1> The flux density of primary cosmic rays in the galaxy is very large,

about 100 000/m^sup 2^-s.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#54:1> The energy density of cosmic rays is very high, more than I MeV/m^sup

3^, so it is assumed that they must originate within our galaxy or else the

mass/energy balance of cosmology would be inconsistent with current theory.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#55:1> Because our galaxy is spinning, it is saturated with a magnetic field

of several microGauss.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#56:1> The cosmic rays interact with this field so that, typically, they

continuously spiral during their lifetime with a spiral diameter of a

fraction of the galactic diameter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#57:1> It is because of this vast spiraling trajectory that a local observer

within the galaxy would detect that the galactic cosmic rays are isotropic

and do not come from particular sources. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#58:1> Particle detectors in satellites have determined that the primary

low-energy cosmic ray particles consist of 92&percent; protons and 6&percent; alpha

particles, with the remainder being heavy nuclei ( Figure 2).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#59:1> There are no free neutrons in the external galactic flux because

neutrons are unstable unless bound in a nucleus and have an 11-minute half

life as free particles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#60:1> The flux of higher-energy particles shown in Figure 2 has been

estimated from various kinds of experiments: ( a) the flux variation of

particles through different strengths of the earth 's geomagnetic field; ( b)

data from large-particle spectrometers flown in balloons to altitudes of 100

km; ( c) measurements of the penetration of hadron cascades into the earth (

marked Indirect in Figure 2); and ( d) the analysis of the very large

individual showers with 10^sup 8^ particles which spread over a hundred

kilometers at sea level ( all from a single incident particle!).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#61:1> Accurate spectrometers in satellites such as CREDE-II have identified

the individual elements in the primary flux, and typical data are shown in

Figure 2(b). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#62:1> These incident particles have such high energies that the

particles have deBroglie wavelengths smaller than a proton diameter ( or,

more explicitly, smaller than the interaction distance of the strong

interaction).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#63:1> Further, their energy is far greater than that of nuclear binding

energies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#64:1> This means that when a cosmic ray alpha particle hits an atmospheric

nucleus, the alpha particle need not be considered as a He nucleus, but can

be treated as independent particles, two protons and two neutrons, with each

one interacting independently with any atmospheric nucleus.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#65:1> Therefore, from the standpoint of its interaction with the

atmosphere, we can simplify the primary particle flux distributions of Figure

2 by assuming that the incident flux is just 71&percent; protons and 29&percent; neutrons.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#66:1> This assumption, along with corrected energy/flux curves for just two

sets of particles, greatly simplifies the calculation of the atmospheric

cascades.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#67:1> Calculations of cosmic ray particle trajectories in the earth 's

magnetic field indicate that initial energies above 1 GeV are necessary for

penetration to the earth 's surface ( see [ 7-16]).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#68:1> Precise satellite measurements show that the incident flux of cosmic

rays with energies above 1 GeV is about 1600/m^sup 2^-s at the edge of the

exosphere with isotropic trajectories [ 17]. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#69:1> <h> Solar flux </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#70:1> A second source of primary cosmic rays is the sun.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#71:1> During the quiet sun period there are essentially no energetic

particles in the solar wind which can reach sea level on earth because of the

low energies of the particles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#72:1> In the active sun period, the solar wind increases by factors of the

order of 10^sup 6^, making it far denser than the galactic particle flux.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#73:1> The sun has a variable cycle which ranges from 9 to 12 years; Table 1

shows the years of the most recent cycle nodes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#74:1> During the previous quiet sun period, 1985-1986, satellite detectors

indicated that there were effectively no energetic particles in the solar

wind which could penetrate to sea level on earth ( i.e., with energies

greater than 1 GeV). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#75:1> The simplest evidence that solar particles do not induce

sea-level cascades is that there is only a small diurnal change.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#76:1> The maximum diurnal effect is estimated at less than 1&percent;; see Figure

3, which indeed shows minima occurring every day at local midnight.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#77:1> During periods of a large solar flare ( which might last a few days),

there is a small chance that the earth might pass through the narrow beam of

particles from the flare, and the total intensity of cosmic rays at the

earth 's surface might double for a few hours.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#78:1> More than two dozen of these events occurred during 1990-1991. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#79:1> However, there is a more important aspect to the solar cycle than

the increased particle flux.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#80:1> The active sun with its large solar wind creates a large distortion

of the magnetic field about the earth ( the magnetosphere), which increases

the earth 's shielding against intragalactic cosmic rays.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#81:1> This leads to a net reduction of the sea-level cosmic rays during the

period of the active sun.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#82:1> In the active sun of 1989-1991, which was the most intense solar

activity ever recorded, the sea-level intensity of cosmic rays actually

decreased by about 30&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#83:1> Thus, the active sun greatly intensifies the solar wind, and the

external particle flux increases, but the earth 's distant magnetic field also

increases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#84:1> The final result of this complex interaction is that the terrestrial

sea-level flux of cosmic particles decreases during the active sun, except

for the few hours during the most spectacular solar flares ( Figure 4). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#85:1> Figure 4 is also a good representation of how the terrestrial

flux which causes soft fails changes with the solar cycle.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#86:1> It includes all hadrons, and also has a significant contribution from

muon capture processes ( described later).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#87:1> It shows that the solar cycle is a perturbation of the general

terrestrial flux, amounting to, at most, a 30&percent; reduction during the most

active solar periods.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#88:1> The data in Figure 4 constitute the longest continuous record of

cosmic rays [ 19-21].
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#89:1> The figure shows the general inverse correlation between solar

activity and terrestrial cosmic rays, but the details of the two phenomena

have only partial relationships.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#90:1> This is because the sunspots, and their corresponding solar flares,

usually distort the solar magnetosphere only in specific directions, and the

effect on the earth depends on whether the earth is in that sector. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#91:1> Solar flares may also send a particularly intense stream of

particles into the solar wind, but these particle streams are usually of such

low energy that they are not detected at sea level.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#92:1> During the period from 1956 to 1972 ( 17 years) there were 61 solar

events which caused particle bursts at satellite altitudes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#93:1> Of these, only 18 were simultaneously detected at sea-level particle

detector stations, with an average change of flux of about 10&percent; for a period

of about a day ( [ 17], p. ( 6-20/21).
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#94:1> More typical is a decrease in particle flux due to increased

intensity of the magnetosphere caused by the solar event.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#95:1> Typical sea-level particle flux changes are shown in Figure 5, in

which a narrow 20&percent; dip is due to a solar flare event.
<ICE-USA:W2A-040#96:1> This type of decrease is called a Forbush decrease, after the

scientist who first related the decrease to solar flares [ 22]. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-040#97:1> Details of the variation of the primary galactic particle flux

with the solar cycle have been measured, and above I GeV there are almost no

significant differences due to the solar cycle. </p> </I>
