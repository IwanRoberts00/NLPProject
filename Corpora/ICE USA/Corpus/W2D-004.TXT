<ICE-USA:W2D-004#1:1> <h> WHAT IS COPYRIGHT?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#2:1> Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the

United States ( title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of " original works of

authorship," including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain

other intellectual works. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#3:1> In addition, certain authors of works of visual art have the

rights of attribution and integrity as described in section 106A of the 1976

Copyright Act.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#4:1> For further information, request Circular 40, " Copyright Registration

for
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#5:1> <h> Works of the Visual Arts."</H></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#6:1> It is illegal for anyone to violate any of the rights provided by

the copyright law to the owner of copyright.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#7:1> These rights, however, are not unlimited in scope.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#8:1> Sections 107 through 121 of the 1976 Copyright Act establish

limitations on these rights.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#9:1> In some cases, these limitations are specified exemptions from

copyright liability.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#10:1> One major limitation is the doctrine of " fair use," which is given a

statutory basis in section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#11:1> In other instances, the limitation takes the form of a " compulsory

license" under which certain limited uses of copyrighted works are permitted

upon payment of specified royalties and compliance with statutory conditions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#12:1> For further information about the limitations of any of these rights,

consult the copyright law or write to the Copyright Office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#13:1> WHO CAN CLAIM COPYRIGHT</H></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#14:1> Copyright protection subsists from the time the work is created

in fixed form.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#15:1> The copyright in the work of authorship immediately becomes the

property of the author who created the work.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#16:1> Only the author or those deriving their rights through the author can

rightfully claim copyright.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#17:1> In the case of works made for hire, the employer and not the

employee is considered to be the author.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#18:1> Section 101 of the copyright law defines a " work made for hire" as a

work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; a

work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a

collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as

a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional

text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the

parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work

shall be considered a work made for hire.... </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#19:1> The authors of a joint work are co-owners of the copyright in the

work, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#20:1> Copyright in each separate contribution to a periodical or other

collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole

and vests initially with the author of the contribution.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#21:1> Works consisting entirely of information that is common property

and containing no original authorship ( for example: standard calendars,

height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, and lists or tables taken

from public documents or other common sources)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#22:1> The way in which copyright protection is secured is frequently

misunderstood.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#23:1> No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright

Office is required to secure copyright.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#24:1> ( See following NOTE.) There are, however, certain definite

advantages to registration.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#25:1> See " Copyright Registration." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#26:1> Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created, and

a work is " created" when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first

time.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#27:1> " Copies" are material objects from which a work can be read or

visually perceived either directly or with the aid of a machine or device,

such as books, manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#28:1> " Phonorecords" are material objects embodying fixations of sounds (

excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture soundtracks), such as

cassette tapes, CDs, or LPs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#29:1> Thus, for example, a song ( the " work") can be fixed in sheet music

( " copies") or in phonograph disks ( " phonorecords"), or both.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#30:1> If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part of the work

that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the created work as of that

date.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#31:1> Publication is no longer the key to obtaining federal copyright

as it was under the Copyright Act of 1909.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#32:1> However, publication remains important to copyright owners.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#33:1> " Publication" is the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a

work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental,

lease, or lending.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#34:1> The offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of

persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public

display constitutes publication.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#35:1> A public performance or display of a work does not of itself

constitute publication.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#36:1> NOTE: Before 1978, federal copyright was generally secured by the

act of publication with notice of copyright, assuming compliance with all

other relevant statutory conditions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#37:1> U. S. works in the public domain on January 1, 1978, ( for example,

works published without satisfying all conditions for securing federal

copyright under the Copyright Act of 1909) remain in the public domain under

the 1976 Copyright Act. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#38:1> Certain foreign works originally published without notice had

their copyrights restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ( URAA).
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#39:1> Request Circular 38b and see the " Notice of Copyright" section of

this publication for further information.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#40:1> Federal copyright could also be secured before 1978 by the act of

registration in the case of certain unpublished works and works eligible for

ad interim copyright.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#41:1> The 1976 Copyright Act automatically extends to full term ( section

304 sets the term) copyright for all works, including those subject to ad

interim copyright if ad interim registration has been made on or before June

30, 1978.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#42:1> A further discussion of the definition of " publication" can be

found in the legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#43:1> The legislative reports define " to the public" as distribution to

persons under no explicit or implicit restrictions with respect to disclosure

of the contents.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#44:1> The reports state that the definition makes it clear that the sale of

phonorecords constitutes publication of the underlying work, for example, the

musical, dramatic, or literary work embodied in a phonorecord.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#45:1> The reports also state that it is clear that any form of

dissemination in which the material object does not change hands, for

example, performances or displays on television, is not a publication no

matter how many people are exposed to the work.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#46:1> However, when copies or phonorecords are offered for sale or lease to

a group of wholesalers, broadcasters, or motion picture theaters, publication

does take place if the purpose is further distribution, public performance,

or public display.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#47:1> Works that are published in the United States are subject to

mandatory deposit with the Library of Congress.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#48:1> See discussion on " Mandatory Deposit for Works Published in the

United States.?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#49:1> The year of publication may determine the duration of copyright

protection for anonymous and pseudonymous works ( when the author 's identity

is not revealed in the records of the Copyright Office) and for works made

for hire.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#50:1> The use of a copyright notice is no longer required under U. S.

law, although it is often beneficial.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#51:1> Because prior law did contain such a requirement, however, the use of

notice is still relevant to the copyright status of older works.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#52:1> Notice was required under the 1976 Copyright Act.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#53:1> This requirement was eliminated when the United States adhered to the

Berne Convention, effective March 1, 1989.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#54:1> Although works published without notice before that date could have

entered the public domain in the United States, the Uruguay Round Agreements

Act ( URAA) restores copyright in certain foreign works originally published

without notice.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#55:1> For further information about copyright amendments in the URAA,

request Circular 38b.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#56:1> The Copyright Office does not take a position on whether copies

of works first published with notice before March 1, 1989, which are

distributed on or after March 1, 1989, must bear the copyright notice. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#57:1> Use of the notice may be important because it informs the public

that the work is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright owner, and

shows the year of first publication.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#58:1> Furthermore, in the event that a work is infringed, if a proper

notice of copyright appears on the published copy or copies to which a

defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall

be given to such a defendant 's interposition of a defense based on innocent

infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided

in section 504(c)(2) of the copyright law.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#59:1> Innocent infringement occurs when the infringer did not realize that

the work was protected.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#60:1> The use of the copyright notice is the responsibility of the

copyright owner and does not require advance permission from, or registration

with, the Copyright Office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#61:1> The " C in a circle" notice is used only on " visually

perceptible copies." Certain kinds of works--for example, musical, dramatic,

and literary works--may be fixed not in " copies" but by means of sound in an

audio recording.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#62:1> Since audio recordings such as audio tapes and phonograph disks are "

phonorecords" and not " copies," the " C in a circle" notice is not used to

indicate protection of the underlying musical, dramatic, or literary work

that is recorded.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#63:1> Sound recordings are defined in the law as " works that result

from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not

including the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual

work." Common examples include recordings of music, drama, or lectures.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#64:1> A sound recording is not the same as a phonorecord.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#65:1> A phonorecord is the physical object in which works of authorship are

embodied.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#66:1> The word " phonorecord" includes cassette tapes, CDs, LPs, 45 r. p.

m. disks, as well as other formats.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#67:1> <h> Position of Notice</h></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#68:1> The copyright notice should be affixed to copies or phonorecords

in such a way as to " give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright." The

three elements of the notice should ordinarily appear together on the copies

or phonorecords or on the phonorecord label or container.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#69:1> The Copyright Office has issued regulations concerning the form and

position of the copyright notice in the Code of Federal Regulations ( 37 CFR

Part 201.20).
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#70:1> For more information, request Circular 3, " Copyright Notice."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#71:1> </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#72:1> <h> Publications Incorporating U. S. Government Works</h></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#73:1> Works by the U. S. Government are not eligible for U. S.

copyright protection.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#74:1> For works published on and after March 1, 1989, the previous notice

requirement for works consisting primarily of one or more U. S. Government

works has been eliminated.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#75:1> However, use of a notice on such a work will defeat a claim of

innocent infringement as previously described provided the notice also

includes a statement that identifies either those portions of the work in

which copyright is claimed or those portions that constitute U. S. Government

material.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#76:1> <h> Omission of the Notice and Errors in Notice</h></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#77:1> The 1976 Copyright Act attempted to ameliorate the strict

consequences of failure to include notice under prior law.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#78:1> It contained provisions that set out specific corrective steps to

cure omissions or certain errors in notice.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#79:1> Under these provisions, an applicant had 5 years after publication to

cure omission of notice or certain errors.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#80:1> Although these provisions are technically still in the law, their

impact has been limited by the amendment making notice optional for all works

published on and after March 1, 1989.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#81:1> For further information, request Circular 3. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#82:1> <h> HOW LONG COPYRIGHT PROTECTION ENDURES</h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#83:1> <h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#84:1> Works Originally Created On or After January 1, 1978</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-004#85:1> A work that is created ( fixed in tangible form for the first

time) on or after January 1, 1978, is automatically protected from the moment

of its creation and is ordinarily given a term enduring for the author 's life

plus an additional 70 years after the author 's death.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#86:1> In the case of " a joint work prepared by two or more authors who did

not work for hire," the term lasts for 70 years after the last surviving

author 's death.
<ICE-USA:W2D-004#87:1> For works made for hire, and for anonymous and pseudonymous works (

unless the author 's identity is revealed in Copyright Office records), the

duration of copyright will be 95 years from publication or 120 years from

creation, whichever is shorter.</p>
