<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#2:1> American medicine is by many measures the best in the world- so

why is it generally agreed that the system is 'in crisis'?
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#3:1> And how do we cure what is wrong without ruining what is right?</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#4:1> <h> THE CLINTON PLAN AND OTHERS</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#5:1> HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON and her Task Force on National Health Care

Reform are attempting to design a health-care system for the twenty-first

century.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#6:1> Unfortunately, key elements of the emerging plan look more like

twentieth-century collectivist experiments in Eastern Europe and Asia than a

futuristic model for America.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#7:1> Bill Clinton 's campaign promises on this subject seemed so

appealing: Health coverage would be extended to 35 million uninsured people

in the United States.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#8:1> All Americans would get full coverage at a reasonable cost, regardless

of their medical history.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#9:1> All plans would offer preventive care as well as protection from

catastrophic expenses.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#10:1> Government would help to streamline administration, reduce paperwork,

and lower costs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#11:1> The money saved on Medicare and Medicaid would be used to help

balance the federal budget.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#12:1> For the last three months, more than five hundred academics and

government bureaucrats have been mired in the complexities of figuring out

how to make these utopian campaign promises a reality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#13:1> The outline of the plan, scheduled to be unveiled this month, is

fairly clear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#14:1> The centerpiece is " managed competition," a depersonalizing scheme

embraced by big corporations, insurance companies, and bureaucratic

organizations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#15:1> Under the plan, large networks of doctors and hospitals, organized

primarily by insurance companies, would offer budget-priced health-care

services to collections of consumers for a fixed monthly fee.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#16:1> Regulators would prescribe the services to which patients would be

entitled through their " core benefits package," and " gatekeepers" in these

big networks would control access.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#17:1> In other words, beyond the mask of " pro-business, pro-

entrepreneur language" ordered up by White House strategist James Carville

lurks a system characterized by price-control agreements, rationing, and

centralized government decisions over how much health care consumers will

get, how they will get it, and how technology will be used and

constrained.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#18:1> Here are some of the elements of the likely proposal:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#19:1> <bold> Core benefits package.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#20:1> </bold> A new National Health Board will define the basic doctor and

hospital services that would be available to all of us, from preventive care

to catastrophic coverage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#21:1> This is tricky, however: If the package is all- inclusive, it will be

impossible to fund, but if it rations care, the political fallout will be

tremendous.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#22:1> <bold> Purchasing cooperatives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#23:1> </bold> New organizations called " health insurance purchasing

cooperatives" or " health alliances" would be created.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#24:1> These quasi-public groups would represent employers and perhaps

individuals in negotiations to buy hospital, doctor, and laboratory services

from newly formed " super HMOs."
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#25:1> The big health-maintenance organizations would compete with one

another to offer the lowest price for providing the core benefits package.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#26:1> The networks would be prohibited from denying anyone coverage and

would be required to charge everyone basically the same monthly fee to

receive health-care services.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#27:1> <bold> A global budget.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#28:1> </bold> One of the trickiest issues is whether to require the new

National Health Board to set a budget for how much the nation would spend on

health care.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#29:1> If a global budget were set, some inflation adjusted version of

current annual expenditures--currently about

&dollar;900 billion--would become the new ceiling, and states would probably be

required to enforce the limits.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#30:1> The task force may require private insurers to abide by new, lower

reimbursement fees for doctor and hospital services for Medicare patients.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#31:1> A debate on whether to impose mandatory price controls has been

raging at the White House.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#32:1> <bold> Employer mandates.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#33:1> </bold> All employers would be required to offer health insurance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#34:1> Ninety-seven per cent of companies responding to a recent National

Association of Manufacturers survey already provide health insurance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#35:1> The National Federation of Independent Business says that two-thirds

of its members provide health insurance, and of the third that don't, 92 per

cent said they would if they could afford it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#36:1> Those that don't are primarily small, start-up, and marginal firms;

the Clinton plan may call for a phase-in with tax breaks to help make the

coverage more affordable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#37:1> However, small-business organizations have warned the President that

requiring employers to provide coverage will mean a loss of up to five

hundred thousand jobs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#38:1> Even before it is unveiled, the Clinton plan is being modified to

respond to political practicalities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#39:1> Patients are being told that they will be able to buy extra services

if they are willing to pay more, and they are being assured they will be able

to choose their own physician.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#40:1> Big companies can opt out of managed-competition networks if they

want.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#41:1> And the task force is considering asking industry for " price-control

agreements" as a substitute for mandatory price controls.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#42:1> Managed competition is tailor-made for a President who professes

support for the private sector but whose political nature compels him to

devise complex new government programs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#43:1> While passage of the proposal is far from assured, the Clinton team

already has scored one significant victory.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#44:1> It has engaged the nation in debating how much and what kind of

control the government will have over the nation 's health-care system,

preempting discussion, at least for now, of alternative free- market

solutions.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#45:1> <h> <bold> The Cold Reality </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#46:1> NOW the hard work and cold reality of paying for the promises has

begun.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#47:1> Task Force czar Ira Magaziner estimates that the plan would cost

&dollar;100 to

&dollar;150 billion in new spending.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#48:1> The White House has tried to squelch the number and put the estimate

at

&dollar;30 to

&dollar;90 billion--a more politically salable figure.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#49:1> The list of problems with managed competition is endless.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#50:1> Internal Task Force documents concede, " The plan would be

cumbersome.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#51:1> Consumers would have to deal with new and unfamiliar agencies [ "

health alliances"] and choose from among plans they feel ill-equipped to

evaluate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#52:1> Unanticipated barriers to service would be erected when people are

sick."
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#53:1> Because managed competition theoretically offers patients unlimited

access to doctors and hospitals, the length of lines at the clinics, not

pricing, would regulate demand.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#54:1> Bureaucrats would continually ratchet down the services in the " core

benefits package" as costs escalated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#55:1> Most importantly, technological innovation would decline as cost

concerns take priority over quality of care.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#56:1> " High-tech medicine" frequently is cited as the culprit in rising

health-care costs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#57:1> While medical technology may be expensive, these advances almost

always lead to more cost-effective total care and a better quality of life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#58:1> In no other industry is less technology considered progress.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#59:1> Unfortunately, restricting access to new technologies is now seen as

part of the solution.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#60:1> The ethical question over access to expensive treatments by those

unable to pay is one of the most difficult to address.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#61:1> But restricting access to innovative treatments and new technologies

because they are too costly to be included in the " core benefits package"

will quickly diminish the quality of patient care for everyone.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#62:1> <h> <bold> The Root of the Problem </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#63:1> THE CURRENT SYSTEM does need fixing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#64:1> It distorts pricing and demand, is inequitable, and is alternately

wasteful and miserly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#65:1> Too many people are locked into jobs they don't like because they are

afraid of losing their health insurance, and millions more don't have

coverage at all, forcing them to go untreated or obtain care in crowded

hospital emergency rooms.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#66:1> Unfortunately for Mr. Clinton, 75 per cent of Americans are

reasonably satisfied with their own health care, according to pollster

William D. Mclnturff of Public Opinion Strategies in Alexandria, Va.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#67:1> " They clearly are not ready for massive changes in the way they get

care for themselves and their families, even though they may say that changes

are needed to fix the system for everyone else," Mclnturff said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#68:1> One reason they are happy is that the great majority of the more

than two hundred million Americans with coverage is insulated from the true

costs of medical services.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#69:1> Imagine that every time you went to the supermarket you paid only 20

per cent of your grocery bill, because your " food insurer" picked up the

rest of your tab.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#70:1> You and other insured shoppers would have little incentive to be cost

conscious, and you would likely buy caviar and prime steaks instead of potato

chips and hamburgers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#71:1> Luxury items eventually would push moderately priced goods off

the shelves, and people without food insurance would find the price of food

prohibitive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#72:1> The cost of food insurance would rise, and more and more people would

be left standing outside the supermarket.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#73:1> This is precisely the system that has fueled the inflation of

health-care costs in the United States.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#74:1> Inflation is the inevitable result of shielding consumers from the

costs of their purchases.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#75:1> And as prices increase, fewer people can afford coverage,

accelerating the spiral.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#76:1> Who are the uninsured today?
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#77:1> Of the estimated 35 million people who lack access to health-care

reimbursement at any given time, many are young people in entry-level jobs,

the self- employed, the working poor who earn too much to qualify for

Medicaid, or workers who are between jobs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#78:1> Half of the uninsured lack coverage for four months or less.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#79:1> Only a small minority, about 15 per cent of the 35 million, are

uninsured for more than two years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#80:1> Even with this group, hospitals rarely deny emergency treatment to

injured or seriously ill patients.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#81:1> Managed competition will not help the chronically uninsured.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#82:1> But rather than target solutions to this entrenched group, policy

makers are ready to impose extraordinarily cumbersome top-down " solutions"

that will dramatically alter a segment of the economy that employs ten

million people and constitutes one-seventh of the U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#83:1> economy.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#84:1> <h> <bold> A Better Idea </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#85:1> THE QUESTION that is central to the problem but which is not

being asked is this: How can we change the behavior of the buyers and sellers

of services so that the health-care sector functions more like a competitive

market?
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#86:1> Here are some options:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#87:1> <bold> Incentives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#88:1> </bold> Americans are sophisticated consumers who decide what they

need in many fields, and they can use the same skills in making purchases

from their doctors, given the proper incentives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#89:1> But U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#90:1> medical-payment systems seldom require them to employ these skills,

partly out of a paternalistic belief that medical care is too complex for

most patients to understand.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#91:1> More than 90 per cent of all medical decisions are made in a non-

crisis situation; if consumers were motivated to be more financially

responsible about health-care purchases, information markets would spring up

to help them make choices.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#92:1> <bold> Tax deductibility.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#93:1> </bold> Nowadays few question the connection between health benefits

and employment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#94:1> But Milton Friedman says this makes no more sense than the early

industrial ploy of paying employees with vouchers that could be spent only at

the company store.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#95:1> The reason Americans expect their employers to buy their health

coverage for them is misguided tax policy that makes premiums deductible for

companies but not for most individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#96:1> The vast majority of employees are precluded from making individual

choices in an open and competitive market to select the kind of health

coverage that best suits their needs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#97:1> Managed competition promises choice, but it will offer only those

choices mandated by government in a highly regulated environment--hardly an

atmosphere for viable competition.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#98:1> Furthermore, employer-based insurance encourages over-use of

health services.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#99:1> Employees have given up wages to get health coverage, and they want

to get value from the wage substitute.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#100:1> As a result, health insurance increasingly has evolved from

catastrophic to first-dollar coverage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#101:1> After employees pay their deductible for the year, they expect to

get all the health care they want for 20 cents on the dollar.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#102:1> This overuse in turn increases the costs of coverage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#103:1> It is highly indicative that more than 97 per cent of individuals to

whom tax-free insurance is available are insured, while only 33 per cent who

must buy health insurance without a tax deduction are insured.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#104:1> Further, the code discriminates against the lowest-paid workers in

favor of the highest-paid.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#105:1> For a typical family earning

&dollar;20,000, the tax break for health insurance is worth

&dollar;366. <ICE-USA:W2B-015#106:1> For some one earning more than

&dollar;100,000, it 's worth

&dollar;1,463.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#107:1> Allowing individuals to purchase their own health insurance with

tax-deductible dollars would do more than anything else to bring market

incentives to the health care system.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#108:1> In this transfer of deductibility, employees would expect

assurances that the money that their employers had been spending on health

coverage would now come to them directly so they could buy their own

coverage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#109:1> Most employers would be happy to arrange this so as to get the

monkey of rising health-care costs off their backs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#110:1> <bold> Restoring true insurance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#111:1> </bold> The great fear of the middle class is not that they won't be

able to pay the bill for their flu shot: it is of bankrupting medical bills

in the event of catastrophic illness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#112:1> But in virtually all developed countries, the concept of using

health insurance as a protection against financial risk has been lost.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#113:1> Instead, health insurance has become a plan for pre-payment of

routine medical expenses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-015#114:1> Those who want the predictability of a pre-paid plan for routine

care should be able to buy such coverage to simplify their access to

physicians.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#115:1> But those who would rather save money and pay out of pocket for

routine bills should be able to buy policies that provide them insurance only

for major bills.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#116:1> This would discourage people from over-using health services.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#117:1> It would reward cost-consciousness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#118:1> And it would encourage people to be more responsible for their own

health.
<ICE-USA:W2B-015#119:1> Just as they realize that reckless driving makes their car insurance

more expensive, disregard for their health could increase the costs of their

medical insurance.</p> </I>
