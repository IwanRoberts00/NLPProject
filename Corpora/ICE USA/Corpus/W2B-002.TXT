<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#1:1> Although most of the citizens of the world 's largest democracy are

Hindus and altogether some 685 million people identify themselves as Hindus,

many Americans probably do not know a Hindu as a friend or acquaintance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#2:1> Yet world wide only Christianity and Islam count more adherents than

Hinduism. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#3:1> In India, where most Hindus live, about 83 out of 100 people

belong to this ancient religion, and there are also substantial Hindu

populations in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia, and half a dozen other

countries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#4:1> In the United States and Europe, Hindus are relatively scarce; an

estimated 400,000 live in the U.S. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#5:1> With few opportunities to know any Hindus or gain firsthand

knowledge of their religion, many Americans rely on a jumble of impressions:

bearded swamis, sacred cows, Untouchables, fakirs lying on beds of nails,

Mahatma Gandhi, exotic temples, idols, and so on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#6:1> Because this religion is virtually confined to the Indian

subcontinent, Westerners have to make a special effort to understand anything

about the incredibly complex religion of Hinduism, the oldest of the major

world religions. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#7:1> All the other major religions trace their history to some

founder-Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#8:1> Hinduism is the exception.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#9:1> No one person can be said to be the founder of Hinduism, which began

to develop more than 4500 years ago when Aryan tribes invaded the

subcontinent and brought with them their sacred writings known as the Vedas.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#10:1> Since then Hinduism has passed through a number of stages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#11:1> In its original Vedic period Hinduism emerged as a worldly and

optimistic faith, in which the faithful worshiped various gods of nature,

such as the god of fire, the god of sky, the god of storms and war. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#12:1> During the next period-the Brahmanic-the role of priests was

greatly expanded; they developed complex rituals for daily life as well as

for life 's milestones.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#13:1> Also during this period the basic concepts of caste, reincarnation,

and karma appeared.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#14:1> These beliefs were found in the Vedic treatises, dated as early as

the 8th and 7th centuries B. C. and known as the Upanishads--the epitome of

early Hindu philosophy. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#15:1> Gradually during this period, Hindus developed the belief that

the many gods they worshiped were really many " faces" of one ultimate

God(Brahman) that is also the atman ( soul) of all living things.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#16:1> In its final stage philosophical Hinduism explored ways in which the

atman could escape from the cycle of births, deaths, and rebirths and achieve

moksha, or liberation, into the Brahman. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#17:1> Hinduism acknowledges a multitude of gods--some say 330 million-

but one should distinguish between the folk religion of the Indian masses and

the Hinduism of the educated and sophisticated elite.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#18:1> The latter see Brahman as the one God who takes form as all the other

gods. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#19:1> Brahman 's chief attributes are seen through the trinity of Brahma

the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Siva the destroyer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#20:1> In practice most Hindus tend to ignore Brahma and direct their

devotion to Vishnu and Siva along with their personal and village gods.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#21:1> All sects agree that their many paths lead to the same moksha. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#22:1> Vishnu is believed to have appeared in nine incarnations to date,

including the popular Rama and Krishna; his tenth incarnation is expected in

about 45O,OOO years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#23:1> Vishnu appears as Krishna in the <it> Bhagavad Gita </it> ( " Song of

the Lord"), Hinduism 's famous epic poem. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#24:1> Popular Hinduism, as practiced in India 's 575,000 villages, seems

both polytheistic and tolerant.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#25:1> Devotees often treat images of the gods in their homes and in the

temples as they would a person: they offer them food and drink, clothe them,

bathe them, and tuck them into bed at night.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#26:1> Again, sophisticated Hindus view these actions as suitable for people

of limited education, but they themselves believe that the gods are only

aspects of the one great god, Brahman. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#27:1> The Western observer may be puzzled by the many sects and

branches of Hinduism, but he or she might consider how Christianity looks to

an educated Hindu.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#28:1> More than a billion people identify themselves as Christians; but

they group themselves in such diverse bodies as Southern Baptists,

Presbyterians, Amish, Roman Catholics, Pentecostals, Jehovah 's Witnesses,

Lutherans, Greek orthodox, Mormons, Anglicans, Seventh-day Adventists, Copts,

Quakers, Methodists, and so on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#29:1> And if Hindu beliefs are difficult to comprehend, so is the Christian

doctrine of the Trinity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#30:1> Many Hindus see the world and material things as not fully real;

the world is but a maya, or illusion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#31:1> People experience misery and frustration because they seek pleasure

and achievement in this world of maya, and they fail to find a fully real

life in God.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#32:1> Only through final union with God can the atman escape this human

condition. </p> <h> You'd bett 'd be nice</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#33:1> Unlike Christianity and Islam, which teach that the individual

will survive death and attain a state of eternal bliss or deprivation,

Hinduism teaches that salvation may take many lives to achieve.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#34:1> If one reaches the state of union with God in this life, he or she

will remain in that union forever.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#35:1> But if a person fails to achieve salvation, he or she will be reborn

until that goal is reached.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#36:1> The soul reaches salvation by four main paths: those of devotion,

knowledge, work, and meditative exercises.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#37:1> An individual Hindu will favor one of these four paths over the other

three. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#38:1> Why do the wicked seem to prosper and the good suffer? Hinduism

seeks the answer in its doctrine of reincarnation, which posits that the

individual dies and is born again as another person or as an animal in an

almost endless series of lives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#39:1> A person 's karma ( the force generated by one 's actions) determines

the nature of the atman 's next incarnations. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#40:1> The evildoer may return to earth as a member of a lower caste or

as a dog, a horse, or an Untouchable ( a person, who is outside the caste

system altogether).
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#41:1> The virtuous person may be assigned to a higher caste.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#42:1> Either in this life or the next all good is rewarded and all evil

punished. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#43:1> One consequence of belief in karma is the common attitude that

those who suffer in this life are simply getting their just deserts.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#44:1> They are suffering the consequences of their bad conduct in a

previous existence. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#45:1> For some Hindus, the doctrine of karma may stem the impulse to

improve the condition of the poor and sickly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#46:1> Following the same reasoning, one wouldn't envy the healthy,

powerful, and fortunate since they are enjoying the fruits of the good they

accomplished in their previous lives.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#47:1> However, most sophisticated Hindus recognize that since all forms of

life have an atman, they are sacred and deserve to be cared for no matter

what their present condition is. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#48:1> Besides reincarnation and karma, the caste system is central to

Hindu beliefs and customs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#49:1> When Aryan invaders conquered the indigenous people, they created the

four castes and divided themselves into the three higher castes, while

assigning the conquered people to the lowest caste. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#50:1> The four castes have since been further divided into

approximately 3000 subcastes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#51:1> Hindus may not change their caste during their lifetimes, but they

may aspire to a higher caste in their next incarnation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#52:1> Caste membership determines many aspects of daily life: choice of

occupation, social status, dress, religious practices, and even eating

habits.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#53:1> Each Hindu is expected to carry out the dharma, or duties, of his or

her par- ticular caste and subcaste. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#54:1> At the top of the system is the Brahmin caste, the priests and

intellectuals.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#55:1> Then come the Kshatriyas of the ruling and warrior caste.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#56:1> Third, the Vaisyas who engage in business and the professions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#57:1> The lowest caste and the one that includes about three fourths of the

Indian population is that of the Sudras, or laborers and farmers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#58:1> Completely outside the caste system are the Untouchables, who are

destined to carry out the most menial tasks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#59:1> Gandhi called these outcastes harijans, or children of God, and urged

compassion toward them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#60:1> The 1949 constitution of the Indian state declares: " Untouchability

is abolished, and its practice in any form is abolished."
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#61:1> This official and legal position has had little effect on the life of

the Untouchables in the thousands of Indian villages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#62:1> Nevertheless, Untouchables can now attend college and aspire to

better jobs despite the social discrimination. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#63:1> Hindu marriages are usually arranged by the parents of the bride

and groom with the children 's consent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#64:1> Of course, people marry within their own caste.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#65:1> It is not uncommon that the husband and wife have not met before the

ceremony.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#66:1> Astrologers choose a propitious time for the wedding ceremony, which

is usually conducted by a Hindu priest in the temple.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#67:1> A Brahmin might preside at the wedding of his own son or daughter.

</p> <h> A man 's world</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#68:1> Hinduism has always emphasized the role of men in religion and

society, and that remains true today.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#69:1> Most Hindu women are expected to find fulfillment in their relations

with their husbands and children.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#70:1> A Hindu man, on the other hand, is said to pass through four stages

of life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#71:1> As a young man, he begins his spiritual journey under the guidance of

a guru.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#72:1> Later he undertakes the responsibilities of marriage, a career, and

community service.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#73:1> Only married men may perform the major religious rites, and a Hindu

is not considered fully qualified until he has sired a son. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#74:1> After middle age he enters the stage of detachment from material

things and may retreat to the forests to live the life of a hermit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#75:1> In the fourth and final stage the person finds union with God and is

considered a holy man.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#76:1> Of course, the demands of modern life may call for some modification

of the final two stages. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#77:1> When a Hindu man believes death is near, he tries to travel to

the holy city of Banares to bathe in the sacred waters of the Ganges River.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#78:1> The bodies of ordinary Hindus are cremated preferably on the

waterfront of the river.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#79:1> A very few sannyasins, or holy men, are not cremated upon death;

rather, their bodies are garlanded by their disciples, weighted, and dropped

into the waters.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#80:1> Then they are believed to have achieved union with Brahman. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#81:1> For many Hindus and Westerners, Gandhi, who lived from 1869 to

1948, represented the highest exemplar of a holy man in modern times.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#82:1> A deeply spiritual reformer and champion of nonviolence, Gandhi was

also influenced by the Sermon on the Mount and other non-Hindu writings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#83:1> For his dedication to an independent India he was sentenced to prison

terms totaling seven years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#84:1> When independence from British colonial rule came in 1947, the

country was split into predominantly Hindu India and an Islamic Pakistan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#85:1> Millions died in the ensuing civil strife.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#86:1> Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu zealot who abhorred tolerance for

Muslims. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#87:1> About 110 million Muslims now live in India, and a much smaller

number of Hindus live in Pakistan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#88:1> Unfortunately conflict between the two great religions has not been

resolved.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#89:1> Riots following the destruction of a mosque at Ayodhya in India in

l992 led to an estimated l2OO deaths.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#90:1> Militant Hindus tore down a mosque built more than 45O years ago, but

which they said was erected on the site of Rama 's birthplace. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#91:1> If a few Hindus resort to violence, the majority display an

attitude of tolerance and nonviolence toward all living things.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#92:1> In this spirit of celebrating the sanctity of life, the cow holds a

special place. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#93:1> For millennia the people of the subcontinent have relied on cows

to pull plows, produce milk for babies, and provide dung, which in dried form

serves as a major domestic fuel.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#94:1> An estimated 16O million cows roam the large cities of India as well

as the villages. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#95:1> At one time killing a cow was a capital offense, and even to this

day no devout Hindu would ever eat beef.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#96:1> At certain times of the year the faithful honor cows by anointing

them with oil and dressing them in garlands.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#97:1> Some wealthy Hindus even endow homes for aged and tired cows.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#98:1> Hindus of certain sects also venerate monkeys, rats, and cobras. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#99:1> Hindus believe one achieves the goal of union with Brahman

through good living, ritual, self-control, detachment, purity, nonviolence,

charity, and compassion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#100:1> For most, yoga occupies a paramount role in their spiritual

development.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#101:1> At least a dozen types of yoga, involving posture, breath control,

and meditative techniques, are practiced. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#102:1> Although comprehensiveness is characteristic of Hinduism, the

religion has given birth to several other religions that could not be

confined to Hinduism 's parameters.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#103:1> For example, Buddhism was founded by a Hindu in the 6th century B.

C.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#104:1> Some of the teachings of Buddha have been incorporated in Hinduism,

and Buddha has been added to the list of incarnations of Vishnu.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#105:1> This reabsorption of Buddhism by Hinduism has been so successful

that, while Buddhism counts hundreds of millions of devotees in China, Japan,

Vietnam, and other countries, it is almost nonexistent in India. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-002#106:1> Two much smaller religions-Jainism and Sikhism-also grew out of

Hinduism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#107:1> Sikhism is relatively new-it goes back to a reform movement in

Hinduism in about l5OO A. D.
<ICE-USA:W2B-002#108:1> The Sikhs reject idols, the caste system, and polytheism but retain

a belief in reincarnation. </p> </I>
