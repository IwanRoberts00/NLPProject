<I>
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#1:1> <h> To our shareholders:</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#2:1> Fiscal 2005 was a year of continued solid, balanced growth for

Cisco from both a product- and market-leadership perspective.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#3:1> We achieved an outstanding financial performance with record profits

and cash generation, year-over-year growth in our core routing and switching

products, and very strong growth in our six advanced technologies.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#4:1> Our enterprise, service provider, and commercial customer market

segments all experienced solid year-over-year growth.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#5:1> However, the highlight for the year was the balance that we achieved

across our geographies, customer market segments, architectural evolutions,

and product families.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#6:1> We believe our financial strength, product leadership, and global

reach uniquely position Cisco as a company not only built to last, but built

to lead. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#7:1> <h> Innovation Strategy</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#8:1> In our opinion, the key to long-term success in the

high-technology industry is ongoing strategic investment and innovation, and

we intend to continue to take good business risks.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#9:1> Our innovation strategy requires a unique combination of internal

development, partnerships, and acquisitions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#10:1> In our opinion, for companies to lead in the technology industry they

must be able to do all three.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#11:1> We continue to believe that our industry will consolidate and that

the consolidation will occur along both technology and business architecture

lines.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#12:1> This technology architecture will probably evolve where the seven

layers of the Open Systems Interconnection ( OSI) stack are first loosely,

then tightly coupled.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#13:1> That is exactly where you see us taking the integration of our core

and advanced technology product architectures.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#14:1> Equally important, companies also have to gain the confidence of

their customers from a vision and strategy perspective, a product

architecture leadership perspective, and a service and support perspective.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#15:1> We think we are very uniquely positioned to continue to win the

hearts, minds, and capital investments of our customers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#16:1> In fiscal 2005 we invested more than

&dollar;3.3 billion in research and development ( R&D).
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#17:1> This resulted in more than 50 product introductions and the

number-one market share leadership position in most of our product

categories, including our advanced technology markets, truly demonstrating

that the investments we made three to five years ago are now paying off.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#18:1> We believe this product momentum will continue in fiscal 2006, and we

will do our best to continue to meet and exceed the expectations of our

customers and partners. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#19:1> <h> Fiscal 2005 Performance</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#20:1> In fiscal 2005 we achieved record performance across almost all

of our financial and operational metrics.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#21:1> Fiscal 2005 revenue was

&dollar;24.8 billion, compared to fiscal 2004 revenue of

&dollar;22.0 billion.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#22:1> Net income on a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP)

basis was

&dollar;5.7 billion, compared to fiscal 2004 GAAP net income of

&dollar;4.4 billion.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#23:1> GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for fiscal 2005 were

&dollar;0.87, compared to

&dollar;0.62 for fiscal 2004.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#24:1> In addition to net income, Cisco generated

&dollar;7.6 billion in cash, highlighting the ongoing quality of our earnings. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#25:1> Cisco demonstrated solid execution on its three long-term

financial priorities.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#26:1> First, we continued to focus on profitable growth with GAAP net

income as a percentage of revenue exceeding 20 percent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#27:1> During fiscal 2005, we increased revenue year over year by

approximately 12.5 percent.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#28:1> Of total revenue, approximately

&dollar;20.9 billion was related to product revenue and

&dollar;3.9 billion was related to service revenue.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#29:1> Our revenue growth is the result of a continued recovery in the

global IT economic environment, and we achieved significant market share

gains in many product areas. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#30:1> Second, we increased our profitability.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#31:1> We increased GAAP net income by 30 percent and GAAP earnings per

share by 40 percent during fiscal 2005, while operating expenses decreased by

3 percent as a percentage of revenue. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#32:1> A key competitive advantage for Cisco is how we use our own

technology to drive productivity.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#33:1> We achieved a key metric by reaching our productivity goal of

approximately

&dollar;700,000 in annualized revenue per employee, up from approximately

&dollar;450,000 in fiscal 2001 when the goal was set.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#34:1> This is significant given that we also increased headcount in fiscal

2005 by 12 percent, primarily in sales and R&D.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#35:1> Our profitability far exceeded our revenue growth rate and is

evidence of our ability to drive productivity and operational efficiency.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#36:1> Third, we maintained our strong and conservative balance sheet,

while aggressively reducing outstanding shares through our share repurchase

program.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#37:1> At the end of fiscal 2005, cash and investments totaled

&dollar;16.1 billion, days sales outstanding ( DSOs) were 31, and annualized

inventory turns were 6.6.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#38:1> During fiscal 2005, we repurchased

&dollar;10.2 billion, or 540 million shares of our stock.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#39:1> Cash used for these repurchases was generated primarily through

operations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#40:1> At the end of fiscal 2005, our cumulative purchases since the

inception of the share repurchase program in September 2001 were

approximately

&dollar;27.2 billion, or 1.5 billion shares, at an average price of

&dollar;18.15. <ICE-USA:W1B-021#41:1> This is a decrease of more than 13 percent in the weighted

average diluted shares outstanding since the inception of the program.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#42:1> The program 's remaining approved repurchase amount is approximately

&dollar;7.8 billion. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#43:1> Our strong cash position provides investment opportunities for

Cisco. The Board of Directors routinely evaluates growth and technology

leadership objectives with the goal of providing an attractive return on

investment for our shareholders. Our technology investments are designed to

extend our current product leadership through new offerings, as well as

feature and functionality enhancements.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#44:1> We believe these investments will allow us to capitalize on new

advanced technologies and emerging geographic markets.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#45:1> These investments include areas such as enterprise IP communications,

network security, and wireless networking.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#46:1> We believe ongoing strategic investments, along with our share

repurchase program and strong cash balance, are in the best interest of Cisco

and our shareholders. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#47:1> <h> Balanced Growth</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#48:1> Cisco 's success in fiscal 2005 can be attributed to the balance

achieved in almost all of our product families, customer market segments, and

geographies.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#49:1> This, combined with our ability to continuously innovate and expand

the industry and our markets, is a significant driver of our success. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#50:1> In fiscal 2005, Cisco 's six advanced technologies showed the

highest revenue growth of our product groups.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#51:1> Revenue from advanced technologies increased 32 percent year over

year to

&dollar;4.4 billion.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#52:1> The six advanced technologies include: enterprise IP communications,

home networking, optical networking, security, storage area networking, and

wireless technology.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#53:1> During fiscal 2005, security and enterprise IP communications

achieved our initial goal of an annual revenue run rate of approximately

&dollar;1 billion.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#54:1> We shipped our 6-millionth IP phone.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#55:1> We continue to expand our advanced technologies and have set an

aggressive goal of announcing several new advanced technologies in fiscal

2006. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#56:1> This year we introduced the integrated services router, one of

the industry 's most comprehensive enterprise solutions for branch offices.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#57:1> The integrated services router is designed to allow customers to

customize solutions by adding security, voice, and wireless capabilities to a

single routing platform.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#58:1> In our core switching families, we made five key product

announcements in fiscal 2005, and Cisco 's switching products continue to

maintain a number-one market share position. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#59:1> We also experienced balance across all key customer market

segments, with solid growth in the service provider, enterprise, and

commercial segments.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#60:1> Our consumer-oriented Linksys division had the highest annual growth

by market segment of approximately 40 percent year over year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#61:1> In terms of our balance among Cisco 's five geographic areas in fiscal

2005, we experienced strong product revenue growth in almost all of our

geographies, increasing total product revenue by 12 percent on an annual

basis.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#62:1> We were also very pleased with our ability to enter new markets

and gain leadership from both a market share and innovation perspective.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#63:1> As mentioned earlier, we believe innovation comes from a combination

of internal development, partnerships, and acquisitions.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#64:1> In terms of key strategic alliances, we accelerated our growth

opportunities with our strategic partners.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#65:1> In fiscal 2005, we continued our strategy of taking good, solid

business risks by completing 17 acquisitions to further extend our talent and

technology opportunities for both our core routing and switching products as

well as our advanced technologies.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#66:1> We believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of future growth

opportunities, and we are confident and optimistic about the areas of the

business that we can control and influence.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#67:1> We intend to continue to add both engineering and sales resources as

we focus on developing the next wave of advanced technologies, growing the

commercial market segment, capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities,

and increasing our market share gains. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#68:1> <h> Corporate Citizenship and Social Responsibility</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#69:1> An integral part of Cisco 's business strategy is corporate

citizenship.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#70:1> We believe this is not only the right thing to do, but is also just

plain " good business."
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#71:1> We employ and advocate responsible business practices and programs,

which builds a lasting trust with our key stakeholders' customers, partners,

employees, and shareholders.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#72:1> In the fall of 2005, Cisco will release its first Corporate Social

Responsibility Report, which will be available

atwww.cisco.com/go/citizenship. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#73:1> We are dedicated to sustaining a diverse, inclusive workforce.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#74:1> We employ responsible operations, product stewardship, and

environmentally friendly design policies, and we encourage our suppliers to

adhere to these standards.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#75:1> Cisco is committed to sound and transparent corporate governance and

financial disclosure practices.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#76:1> Our Website provides Cisco 's corporate governance policies and

practices, corporate citizenship programs, and financial information. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#77:1> Cisco is also committed to education.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#78:1> We have Networking Academies in more than 160 countries, with

approximately 10,000 academies and 420,000 students.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#79:1> Students in high schools, technical schools, colleges, and community

organizations learn hands-on networking skills to prepare for the workforce

of today and the future.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#80:1> The Jordan Education Initiative, spearheaded by Cisco in partnership

with the World Economic Forum and several other organizations, has created a

replicable model and is expanding its interactive e-curriculum-based

education programs into other geographic areas. </p> I<p><ICE-USA:W1B-021#>n the area of

giving back, employees celebrated Cisco 's 20th anniversary by donating more

than 20 years' worth of community service hours, or 235,000 hours far

exceeding the goal of 175,200.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#81:1> During a time of global need, Cisco and our employees donated more

than

&dollar;4 million in relief efforts for the South Asia tsunami victims.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#82:1> We are truly proud to be a part of a strong culture of giving back

and social responsibility. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#83:1> <h> Built to Last, Built to Lead</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#84:1> In fiscal 2005, we made evolutionary changes that support our

long-term strategy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#85:1> We announced a reorganization of our geographic segments to better

address our global approach and focus on key growth areas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#86:1> We evolved our engineering and sales leadership, demonstrating our

continued bench strength and investment in future opportunities.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#87:1> Our ability to implement these changes smoothly is one of our core

competencies. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#88:1> Fiscal 2005 marked the end of our 20th anniversary, and on August

10, 2005, more than 3,000 employees participated in the " Virtual Opening" of

The NASDAQ Stock Market at Cisco 's headquarters.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#89:1> This historical virtual opening bell ceremony showcased the power of

networking technology, demonstrated how a stock market can be opened anytime,

anywhere, eliminating distance and time restrictions, and reiterated Cisco 's

commitment to technology and innovation leadership. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#90:1> Looking ahead, we believe that Cisco 's unique balance of

financial strength, product leadership, and global presence truly position us

as a company that is not only built to last, but built to lead.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#91:1> We would like to recognize the contributions of Don Valentine and Jim

Gibbons for their years of service to Cisco 's Board of Directors, and on

behalf of the Board, we would like to thank our customers, partners,

employees, and shareholders for their continued confidence and support.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#92:1> We hope to make the next 20 years equally successful. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#93:1> <h> BUILT TO LAST</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#94:1> We are pleased with our strong performance in fiscal 2004 and

believe the investments we made 12 to 36 months ago are paying off in terms

of our business and financial metrics.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#95:1> Going into fiscal 2005, we will continue to focus on our three major

growth areas of core routing and switching, service provider, and Advanced

Technologies, as well as network architecture evolution expectations and a

continued focus on profit contribution. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#96:1> For 20 years, Cisco 's strategy has included an intense focus on

results, catching market transitions, and listening to our customers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-021#97:1> We helped build the foundation of the Internet by building the

routers and switches that fueled it, and we believe that the best is yet to

come in terms of increases in productivity and standard of living that can be

created from technology innovation from companies such as Cisco. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-021#98:1> We are confident that Cisco is a company that is built to last,

and on behalf of our Board of Directors, we would like to thank our

customers, partners, employees, and shareholders for your continued

confidence and support.</p>
