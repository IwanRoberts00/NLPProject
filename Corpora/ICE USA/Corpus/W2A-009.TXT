<ICE-USA:W2A-009#1:1> <H> Cultural History, Interdisciplinarity, and Romanticism</H>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#2:1> Increasingly literary scholarship and criticism is turning to

interdisciplinary approaches that stretch beyond the now familiar linkings of

literature and art, literature and history, literature and philosophy.1

Romantic Studies in particular has been experiencing a shift toward an

emphasis on cultural history in the last few years, as books and articles

have come out on taste, the metropolis, ecocriticism, colonialism and empire,

trade routes and their impact, and the dominance of theatre and spectacle in

the cultural imaginary.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#3:1> Romanticist conferences have focused on themes relating to migration,

mobility, cosmopolitanism, and the developing sciences in the period.2 Such

research has demonstrated the importance of considering both the global and

the local, and of questioning frameworks that are in themselves only

relatively new, such as the public/private divide, the polite/popular culture

divide, gender practices, consumer culture, and everyday life.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#4:1> Although there has been some effort on the part of historians to step

back and define cultural history as a distinct practice, what remains to be

done is a thoroughgoing examination of cultural history as a theoretically

framed and integrative approach to the past.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#5:1> Here I will sketch out some points about cultural history that may aid

in such an interrogation.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#6:1> Cultural historical research necessitates a multiply layered

perspective and approach.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#7:1> This is not the same as interdisciplinarity, because interdisciplinary

approaches presuppose the priority of the disciplines, with their grounding

objects of study: the discipline of literature takes a particular kind of

text as its object; history takes the nation state; sociology takes class;

anthropology takes culture; ethnology takes comparative cultures, economics

takes the industrial city.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#8:1> These objects are constructs: class, for instance, is an abstract

concept that defines sociological research in the direction of class

conflict.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#9:1> This assumed definition narrows, methodologically but also

conceptually, how society might be studied.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#10:1> Similarly, although literary scholars and historians both study

texts, historians examine texts for evidence while literary scholars examine

particular kinds of texts for formal and cultural expression.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#11:1> Interdisciplinary studies also presume these disciplinary frameworks,

so that something like urban studies, while drawing on economics, sociology,

and so forth, takes as its object of study class in the metropolis.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#12:1> As Romanticists attempt to go ever deeper into textual

understanding while staying attuned to the cultural milieu that produced

Romantic Period texts and that formed the imaginations of their authors, they

are forging new relations with other disciplines, as is happening in so many

of the liberal arts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#13:1> For literary scholars the other disciplines proving useful are

increasingly those of the social sciences  economics, psychology,

demographic studies, anthropology, urban studies  and hard sciences such as

meteorology, geology, cartography, environmental studies, astronomy, and the

medical sciences.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#14:1> While some academics worry about the way in which the sciences appear

to be valued over the humanities in interdisciplinary research, and others

are concerned about retaining disciplinary purity as scholars attempt to

master the approach and the skills of other disciplines, these concerns may

be balanced by what we necessarily stand to gain in the pooling of

information.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#15:1> Here is where cultural history steps in, because its starting point

differs from that of the disciplinary object of study.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#16:1> Cultural history asks a question or poses a problem.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#17:1> In seeking to answer that question or understand that problem, the

scholar is freed to bring together whatever tools are necessary to create

frameworks from which to study it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#18:1> Thus the accepted disciplinary practice of disregarding what does not

fit the approach to a defined object of study can no longer apply: the

scholar must be open to all potential facts, paradoxes, and discrepancies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#19:1> This form of <quote> thinking outside the box</quote> allows for a

flexible practice  one that resists the regularization of approach and

methodology since each new problem or question requires new frameworks to be

created. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#20:1> Thus, when a cultural historian asks what daily life was like in

Romantic period London, and draws on literature, urban studies and the

history of economics to do so, a new framework must be devised to reconstruct

what it was like, for instance, for Jane Austen to purchase her tea, sugar,

cocoa, dress materials, and gloves, or to attend fashionable art exhibitions

while visiting her banker brother in Sloane Street.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#21:1> The consumer history, material culture, and trade economics involved

in this information sheds light not just on the lives of real people, but on

the careful detailing of foodstuffs, dress fabrics and accessories in womens

novels, all of which signal something important to characterization or plot

in the specific act or article of dress being described.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#22:1> Involving the theory of everyday life in this mix would help

reconstruct what everyday practices were, although such reconstructions are

admittedly incomplete and open to ongoing revision.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#23:1> The same pooling of disciplinary resources ( rather than restricting

oneself to methodological purity) would allow a scholar to reconstruct the

cultural importance of what Richard Altick has termed <quote> the shows of

London</quote> ( 1), a sudden emergence of exhibitions of curiosities,

natural objects, and art that moved indoors from the public square space of

Bartholomew Fair and Southwark Fair, or that became more public and

entrepreneurial than the antiquarian collections of wealthy virtuosi (

gentlemen scholars) and picture collections of the great landed families.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#24:1> The new indoor shows ranged from innovative technologies such as

mechanical manikins to menageries of exotic animals, exhibitions of foreign

plants or artifacts, displays of live tribal peoples with their native

costumes and implements, and shows of exotic or ancient art.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#25:1> While we might make the connection easily between these London shows

and the rise of national museums in the nineteenth century, such a

reconstruction requires revealing the trade networks, collecting fads,

scientific research, and global explorations that made such shows possible,

and that gave enormous stimuli to the great literary imaginations of the

period, from the visionary William Blake to the cosmopolitan Lord Byron. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#26:1> This way of framing the pursuit of knowledge differs in kind and

degree from that of interdisciplinarity, which is all too frequently touted

as the answer to disciplinary restrictiveness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#27:1> Indeed, scholars have been warning about interdisciplinarity as a

too-easy accommodation of disciplines for years.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#28:1> In 1988 Janet Wolff complained that when literary studies and

sociology were brought together, particularly in the U.S., the result was

either a literary critical investigation privileging an ideological-critical

perspective which rarely attempted <quote> to discuss representation as the

complex product of processes and institutions,</quote> or it was a

sociological investigation that analyzed institutions <quote> without a real

sensitivity to representation and textuality</quote> ( 109).3 Insensitivity

to either institutional agency on the one hand, or aesthetic form on the

other, means an either/or approach and a constitutive blindness to cultural

processes: social and economic relations and social and ideological relations

constitute culture as it is experienced.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#29:1> Wolff puts some of the blame for this lack of real

interdisciplinarity on the weight given scientific objectivity versus

subjectively informed humanistic interpretative strategies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#30:1> The nineteenth-century professionalization of more generalized areas

of scholarship into separate disciplines contributed to the segregations of

knowledge and activity that have helped create an <quote> increasingly

fragmented and compartmentalized way of life</quote> ( 72).
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#31:1> The professionalizing of the university guided not only the creation

and definition of disciplines, it also guided collaborative effort.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#32:1> <quote> Interdisciplinary</quote> work was often taken to be

research that occurred entirely within the domain of one discipline or that

centered on a shared object of study, rather than one that profited from

different epistemological frameworks.4 Attempts to talk across disciplinary

boundaries became increasingly fraught in the second half of the twentieth

century as the increased value given culturally and politically to scientific

specialization was accompanied by a decreasing valuation of humanistic

generalism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#33:1> Either/or thinking reflects the binarisms at stake in disciplinary as

well as interdisciplinary studies.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#34:1> We are still struggling with this see-saw effect in which the

liberal arts and the sciences are made to counterbalance each other, as we

also struggle to escape the constraints and blindspots of disciplinary

assumptions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#35:1> Each year more efforts are made to reconnect scientific and artistic

knowledge through projects that, for instance, might investigate both the

mechanics of the eye and the interpretive judgments determined by that eye

toward an artwork, or that might apply the principles of baroque music to

medical research on the ear.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#36:1> But this recent trend is often untheorized and haphazard.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#37:1> It has been preceded by more traditional forms of discipline-crossing

in which two disciplines from the humanities or two from the physical

sciences are brought together in ways that do not interrogate the assumptions

of either discipline, and therefore do not de-compartmentalize how an object

of study is conceived or approached.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#38:1> Because so much has been made of interdisciplinary work and areas of

study in the last two decades or so, scholars may well have wanted to rush to

knowledge rather than taking the time to learn how economists construe trade

relations or model urban demographics, how historians gather and analyze

data, or how art historians analyze paintings, architectural elevations and

other visual images and artifacts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#39:1> As Janet Wolff notes, we tend to foreground our own discipline, and

for literary scholars this means giving analysis of the literary text

priority.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#40:1> Often a multidisciplinary approach ( putting two disciplines

side-by-side) provides an easy fix because it does not demand the same degree

of theoretical and methodological integration as an interdisciplinary one (

interconnecting disciplines at a deep level so that each is viewed through

the other), and yet appears to escape the difficulties arising in

interdisciplinary work.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#41:1> A thorough integration of conceptual frameworks and tools can move us

even further past disiciplinary assumptions and facile approaches, producing

knowledge through a juxtaposition of disciplines that encourages

cross-interrogation into the cultural past.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#42:1> This does not mean <quote> breaking down the walls</quote> between

the disciplines so much as talking across them to see how similarities and

differences in conceptual models and disciplinary methods can be made to help

us view problems in cultural history in a more three-dimensional way.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#43:1> Cultural history can provide a method of problem-solving by opening

up frameworks rather than presuming them. </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#44:1> But we do need to attend seriously to a careful use of

disciplinary knowledge as we move beyond the boxes that disciplines

construct.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#45:1> First, language itself can often trip us up.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#46:1> Different disciplines have different technical meanings for words, as

in <quote> prosody,</quote> which in literary analysis refers to the poetic

effects ( acoustics and rhythm, or versification) of crafted language, is

used in linguistics to refer to parts of a languages sound structure ( tone

and intonation), and in musicology to refer to musical phrasing and acoustic

cues.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#47:1> Yet the very use of the same term by different disciplines also

facilitates interdisciplinary research, as when clinical psychologists use

linguistics to help explore cognitive dysfunction through a patients

recognition of affective prosody ( emotional tone of voice) and propositional

prosody ( whether the sentence is a question, imperative or declarative).

</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#48:1> Second, interdisciplinary study is usually too grounded in the

disciplines that gave rise to it, such as urban studies, which developed from

a particular integration of sociology, economics, and history, while American

studies integrates disciplines necessary to the analysis of class, race, and

gender.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#49:1> These interdisciplinary studies developed new conceptual models based

on the theories that orient their object of study.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#50:1> They thus create new ways of understanding that offer insights to

other fields, but they can also provoke deeply instilled resistance to the

intermixing of discipline-specific methodologies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#51:1> Those working in cultural history need to beware the distinction

between interdisciplinary work and an approach that moves beyond disciplinary

methodologies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#52:1> As Dror Wahrman notes of an improperly conceived cultural history,

its <X> most problematic methodological quagmire . . . can be described as

the difficulty of the <quote> weak collage</quote>: the historian,

identifying a seemingly similar phenomenon in several disparate cultural

spheres at the same historical moment, declares it to be a pattern of

historical significance. ( 45)</X>
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#X53:1> Although this difficulty can be circumvented through quantitative

evidence, the historians stock-in-trade, the problems of change over time

and categorical difference can mean that pattern changes in cultural forms

and modes might be dispersed throughout a period or beyond period boundaries

rather than accumulating synchronously.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#X54:1> It is the cross-interrogation of their appearance, in other words,

that resolves anomalies into discernible patterns, and that produces real

knowledge rather than a <quote> weak collage.</quote> </p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-009#X55:1> Cultural history involves an approach in which cultural and

material practices are investigated in order to reveal shifts in human

subjectivity and identity, social class hierarchies and constructions,

political identity, institutional formations, and changes in religious,

economic, and creative practices, their reception and tolerance or

resistance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#X56:1> The term <quote> culture</quote> itself is a hotly debated one,

its meaning ranging from social history to anthropological analysis, cultural

sociology, ethnography, cultural studies, community identity, cultural

identity, and a tradition of cultural achievements in the arts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#X57:1> For literary studies, Raymond Williamss seminal works on the

cultural grounds of literary production provide the arena for understanding

culture as the integration of traditional, dominant, and emergent forms

that at any one moment formulate a literary culture, and the economic and

social conditions that facilitate such a culture.5 But those trained in other

disciplines would argue for a different understanding; anthropologists, for

example, have moved from considering <quote> culture</quote> as a

non-dynamic concept to understanding it as that which is dynamically produced

at any given moment by a body of people, so that an individual can move from

the culture of his or her workplace to the culture of the street, to that of

the subway, to that of the home.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#X58:1> As William Sewell argues, part of the confusion in how to define

culture lies in the hazy distinctions often made between conceptual and

concrete understandings of <quote> culture.</quote> Theoretical concepts of

culture refer to broad categories of social life, while concrete studies of

cultures refer to culture as practice, culture <quote> not [ as] a coherent

system of symbols and meanings but a diverse collection of tools that . . .

are to be understood as means for the performance of action </quote> (

Sewell 40).
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#X59:1> This understanding of concrete cultures, viewed through theories

arising from a range of disciplines, can produce a cultural history that

reconstructs a stronger and more vital picture of the past or present.
<ICE-USA:W2A-009#X60:1> By contrast, not differentiating clearly between conceptual and

concrete meanings of culture can lead to a falsifying attempt to integrate

these two definitions, allowing the <quote> smuggl[ing of] highly debatable

assumptions into ethnographic accounts  for example, that cultural meanings

are normally shared, fixed, bounded, and deeply felt </quote> ( 41). </P>
