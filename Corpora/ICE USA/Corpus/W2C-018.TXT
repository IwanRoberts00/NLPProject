<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#1:1> A US West Communications plan to sell its 60 rural telephone

exchanges and invest the profits in improved telecommunications would be a

boon to Billings, the Montana Public Service Commission Has told Thursday

night.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#2:1> In a public hearing at Parmly Billings Library representatives of

the city 's business, medical and education communities repeatedly told

commission members that the sale would boost their ability to compete

nationally and internationally.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#3:1> <h> US West plans to sell its exchanges to six rural Montana

cooperatives </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#4:1> The company asked the PSC to make two declaratory rulings--that

the sale is in the public 's best interest, and that the gains will go to US

West and not to ratepayers, said John Alke, attorney for US West.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#5:1> In Billings, 13 people voiced their opinions, mainly about the

advantages of investing money in urban telecommunications systems.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#6:1> No one spoke against the sale.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#7:1> Because of the state 's remote location and its sparse population,

it has been ill-equipped to compete in business, said Jerry Thomas, executive

director of the Montana Tradeport Authority.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#8:1> " Recent advancements in computer and telecommunication technology can

change all this.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#9:1> Such advancements have the potential to allow Montana businesses, even

in remote locations, to become competitive."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#10:1> The Federal Communications Commission also must approve the sale.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#11:1> The sale price of the 60 US West telephone properties is

&dollar; 124.8 million.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#12:1> US West says its profit on the sale will be

&dollar; 29.2 million, after taxes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#13:1> Through the terms and conditions of the sales agreement, the

cooperatives have agreed to provide equipment upgrades and modernize the

rural exchanges.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#14:1> Regardless, US West is committed to modernizing those exchanges,

said Mary Wright, attorney for the Montana Consumer Counsel.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#15:1> The Montana Consumer Counsel doesn't oppose the sale, she said,

but favors giving the profit to the ratepayers, instead of US West

shareholders.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#16:1> Under the US West plan, the shareholders would invest the profit

in TeleTech, a program to implement high-tech telecommunications in its urban

service areas, including Billings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#17:1> For instance, more than 170 miles of new fiber-optic cable will

be installed in Billings, Bozeman, Butte, Great Falls, Helena and

Missoula.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#18:1> " TeleTech is still not free," Wright said during a break in the

meeting.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#19:1> " In the future, US West will expect to get a return of its

investment and on its investment, so it 's

&dollar; 28 million at least twice.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#20:1> We don't see that the people that are talking tonight have really

been exposed to a meaningful discussion of the costs."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#21:1> Educators, business people and those in the medical field

insisted that they would be better off with the investment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#22:1> Charles Brooks, a retired businessman, told commission members

that it is the stockholders who have taken the risks, and they are the ones

who should profit.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#23:1> " Why should the ratepayer benefit? Has he shared any risk? Has he

made any investment in the company?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#24:1> City Administrator Mark Watson urged commission members to

consider whether a rebate to customers is worth the technological

improvements in a highly competitive market.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#25:1> " We need a lot of these services now and we needed them years

ago," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#26:1> Jock Michelotti said the Billings Area Chamber of Commerce

endorses the US West plan.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#27:1> And, he said, speaking as a member of the District 2 School Board,

students would also benefit from the sale.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#28:1> " In our analysis of what our needs are in the future, technology

is extremely important," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#29:1> The cooperatives involved in the sale are Blackfoot Telephone

Cooperative, Missoula; Mid-Rivers Telephone Cooperative, Circle; Nemont

Telephone Cooperative, Scobey; Range Telephone Cooperative, Forsyth; Three

Rivers Telephone Cooperative, Fairfield; and Triangle Telephone Cooperative,

Havre.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#30:1> These cooperatives are members of the Montana Telephone

Association.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#31:1> The Billings hearing was one of 31 scheduled hearings across the

state aimed at collecting public opinion on the sale.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-018#32:2> <H> Bank of Montana bought out: Acquisition by Norwest Corp. would

create state 's largest bank</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#33:2> Norwest Corp. said Monday that it has signed a definitive

agreement to purchase the Bank of Montana System, a move that would result in

the state 's largest banking organization.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#34:2> If the acquisition is approved by state and federal regulators,

the combined companies would control about

&dollar; 1.6 billion in assets and

&dollar; 1.4 billion in deposits.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#35:2> The two organizations currently operate 37 locations across the

state.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#36:2> The two banking companies would have a combined 18.7 percent market

share in Montana 's banking industry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#37:2> Great Falls-based Bank of Montana System has 29 banking locations

in 25 communities, with total assets of

&dollar; 793 million.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#38:2> Norwest Banks in Montana have assets of

&dollar; 855 million and eight locations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#39:2> Norwest also operates five locations in Wyoming.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#40:2> With the proposed acquisition, Norwest 's Montana-Wyoming region would

have

&dollar; 2 billion in assets. Norwest banks in Montana and Wyoming are subsidiaries

of the

&dollar; 47.8 billion Norwest Corp., based in Minneapolis.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#41:2> First Bank System currently is the state 's banking leader, with

deposits of

&dollar;1.1 billion and a 14.8 percent market share.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#42:2> The terms of the acquisition weren't disclosed, and officials

from the two banking companies said the regulatory approval of the

acquisition could take at least six months.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#43:2> Bob Worth, president of Norwest Bank Billings, said no decisions

have been made regarding how many offices would remain open, nor have there

been any decisions regarding employment of the two combined companies.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#44:2> " The combination of Bank of Montana System and Norwest Banks

will bring together two Montana institutions with strong local traditions,"

Worth said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#45:2> " We are confident that Norwest, one of the nation 's most

successful financial services companies, will provide our communities

throughout Montana with a broader array of services and products and a high

level of community involvement," said Ed Lamb, executive vice president of

Bank of Montana System.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#46:2> A new state banking law, which allows some out-of-state bank

holding companies to buy Montana banks, goes into effect Oct. 1.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#47:2> Norwest 's proposed acquisition of Bank of Montana System is seen as

one of several possible mergers that could result from the new interstate

banking law.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#48:2> In late July, Bank of Montana announced that it was discussing

the possible merger with another banking company.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#49:2> Norwest then conducted a due diligence review of Bank of Montana 's

operations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#50:2> Earlier this year, federal regulators approved the merger of Bank

of Montana and Billings-based Montana Bancsystem Inc.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#51:2> Some analysts considered the earlier merger a way for Bank of Montana

to groom itself for a merger with a larger company.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#52:2> Norwest Corp. is involved in banking, insurance, investments and

other financial services in all 50 states, all 10 Canadian provinces and

other countries.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-018#53:3> <H> Deacare looks at options</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#54:3> Short-term contract will keep Deacare in the air for at least

three months while Deaconess Medical Center and Cardinal Drilling Co., its

grounded air-service contractor, await the outcome of a federal hearing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#55:3> " At this point, we are looking at what all the options are,"

Joyce Dombruski, Deaconess emergency services manager, said Monday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#56:3> Since the 90-day agreement began on Friday with Air Methods

Corporation, the nation 's largest exclusive provider of emergency air medical

transportation systems and services, Deacare has made nine flights.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#57:3> Deaconess has an option to renew the agreement for a second

90-day period with the Denver-based firm.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#58:3> Marius Burke, director of operations for Air Methods, said 13

pilots were trained for Air Methods certification.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#59:3> He said two twin-engine Beechcraft King Air 200s owned by the

hospital, and two smaller leased planes, were brought into service.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#60:3> " Mostly paperwork needs to be taken care of," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#61:3> " Primary ( physical) changes were with the medical interiors that

had already begun before they came down to us."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#62:3> Deacare medical flight teams have been working on the ground

since Aug. 8, when the Federal Aviation Administration began an investigation

of Cardinal Deaconess 's pilot and air service management contractor.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#63:3> The FAA grounded all four planes and required a lengthy inspection

before they were cleared for takeoff again.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#64:3> The FAA also has issued emergency orders that could put Cardinal

out of the flying business permanently.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#65:3> The agency revoked Cardinal 's flying certificate and its chief

pilot 's license.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#66:3> Cardinal and the pilot have appealed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#67:3> Although Cardinal 's contract is not up until 1997, Deaconess

offered Air Methods a temporary subcontract to keep Deacare 's services in

place.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#68:3> Kurt Burris, president of Cardinal said the hearing before an

National Transportation Safety Board judge is scheduled for late October or

early November.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#69:3> " Our intentions are to clear ourselves of all FAA charges and

resume with the contract," Burris said.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-018#70:4> <H> MPC sued for on-call policy</h> tain

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#71:4> A trial that began Monday in a lawsuit brought by three Montana

Power Co. computer technicians could help refine federal Requirements for

compensating workers who are " on call."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#72:4> The employees, who work at the MPC Colstrip generating plant,

contend that they should be paid time and a half for the hours they spend on

call every fourth week.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#73:4> Each of the plaintiffs--Richard L. Fitz, Larry Jones and Gregory L.

Peterson--will apparently be asking

&dollar; 140,000 in back pay, their attorney, Stephen Mackey of Billings, indicated

during his questioning of potential jurors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#74:4> MPC attorney Patrick Fleming told the jury that the employees

were already well compensated for their work, and that the on-call system in

use was technicians' idea, not the company 's.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#75:4> According to Mackey, each of the employees works a 40-hour week.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#76:4> But every fourth week, one of the four computer technicians in the

division spends the week, including the weekend, on call.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#77:4> The employee must stay close enough to a telephone to respond within

15 minutes.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#78:4> Each of the technicians is equipped with a pager that must be carried

during the entire week.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#79:4> Mackey said that the range of the pager is only about five miles,

which means that the person on call has to remain with a five-mile radius of

the plant, he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#80:4> The key issue in the case will be the extent of the limitations

placed on their lives while they are on call, and how much is fair

compensation for the disruption in their lives.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#81:4> In his opening argument, Mackey said that when Fitz is on call,

he can't attend church or take classes toward a college degree, and that he

has also missed his daughter 's Christmas play.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#82:4> Mackey said Peterson hasn't been able to spend Christmas or

Thanksgiving with his family in Billings, has missed the wedding of a close

friend and is unable to accept social invitations with people he socializes

with in his church.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#83:4> Mackey said that Jones has missed his daughter 's out-of-town

basketball games and her solo choir performance in Miles City.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#84:4> He said they all have trouble sleeping through the night because of

calls from the plant or anticipation of calls from the plant.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#85:4> Others workers who are on call at the plant aren't tied to

Colstrip and have no mandatory call in, Mackey said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#86:4> But the computer technicians are required to be within 15 minutes of

the plant.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#87:4> That distinction will apparently be an important one.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#88:4> Fleming said that the three workers are already well paid for

their time. They get paid more than

&dollar; 30 an hour when they are called out, he said, and they are paid each time

for a minimum of two hours.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#89:4> The MPC attorney said that until 1986 or 1987, the computer

technicians did shift work to cover the plant 24 hours a day.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#90:4> But the technicians objected to the rotating shifts and asked for an

on-call system instead.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#91:4> The proposal was apparently made by the fourth technician in the

computer group, who will testify for the power company.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#92:4> Fleming said that the company said it would not go along with the

on-call system unless all the technicians agreed.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#93:4> Mackey said that Fitz, the only plaintiff who was working in the

computer division at that time, was opposed to the on-call system, but agreed

to go along because all the other technicians wanted it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#94:4> The current system has been fair, flexible and lucrative for the

technicians, Fleming said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#95:4> The technicians fix their own on call schedule a year in advance and

submit it to MPC.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#96:4> The company places no restrictions on their ability to trade on-call

time, he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#97:4> Modems were purchased for the technicians so they could work from

their homes if they were called.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#98:4> He said they can chose to work 10-hour shifts instead of 8-hour

shifts so they can have three-day weekends.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#99:4> The technicians are also provided pagers so they can go anywhere in

the Colstrip community, Fleming said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-018#100:4> And if the technician is called and it 's inconvenient for him to

come to the plant right then, the company has always allowed for a delay, he

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-018#101:4> The case is being heard by U.S. Magistrate Richard Anderson in

Billings. Trial is expected to conclude by midweek.</p> </I>
