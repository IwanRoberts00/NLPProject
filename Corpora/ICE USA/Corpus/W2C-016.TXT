<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#1:1> US West is helping Time Warner build an experimental cable TV

system in Orlando, Fla.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#2:1> BellSouth may be putting its money behind the New York Rangers hockey

team.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#3:1> NYNEX, in a sense, will back Beavis & Butt-head.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#4:1> Once-boring regional telephone companies are on a tear, investing

in television and entertainment and remaking themselves for the video age -

an era when the telephone, TV and computer merge into one technology.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#5:1> The moves are risky.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#6:1> They dance daringly around regulations and the phone company 's role as

low-cost provider of local telephone service.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#7:1> Some of the companies may be rushing blindly into areas they don't

know much about.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#8:1> John McCann at Duke University 's business school thinks the phone

companies are flailing, trying to cut any deal they can.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#9:1> " It 's almost monkey see, monkey do," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#10:1> " They see a strategic move and say, 'I might want to do that, too.'

It 's all just popping now, purely driven by competition."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#11:1> But that may be OK.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#12:1> Fast-changing technology is creating a world where the strongest

communications companies will be those that can transmit, manage and, most

important, create video information and entertainment - all under one

umbrella.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#13:1> Low-capacity phone wires and plain old voice communication are

becoming obsolete.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#14:1> Many say phone companies have to buy their way into the video age if

they want to compete and grow.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#15:1> " Some of these investments are going to turn out to be the

eight-tracks of the ' 90s," says Jeffrey Kagan of Tele Choice Consulting,

referring to short-lived eight-track audio tapes of the 1970s.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#16:1> " But they have to get in.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#17:1> This is exploding."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#18:1> To add to the temptation, phone companies are now seen as

potential sugar daddies by the TV and multimedia crowd.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#19:1> Phone companies have tremendous amounts of available cash - none has

operating cash flow below

&dollar; 4 billion a year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#20:1> Denver-based US West barely blinked at investing

&dollar; 2.5 billion in Time Warner in early 1993.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#21:1> Companies looking for money go knocking on phone executives'

doors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#22:1> " Certainly the

&dollar; 2.5 billion message US West sent has not been lost on anyone," says Gary

Arlen, a Bethesda, Md., consultant.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#23:1> On the phone company side, CEOs and strategic development

departments are deciding to jump in based on commonly held beliefs about

where their industry is heading.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#24:1> Here 's what 's driving the seven regional phone companies, according

to US West CEO Richard McCormick and industry executives:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#25:1> The phone companies own billions of dollars worth of copper phone

lines that run into 95% of homes and businesses.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#26:1> Those basic phone lines, if doctored by the latest computers, can

possibly carry one channel of vide&percent; programming.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#27:1> By comparison, cable TV 's coaxial cable, running to 60% of homes and

businesses, can carry at least 500 to 700 channels if a computer helps.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#28:1> Those lines could carry TV, movies, comp&percent;ter services like Prodigy

and video or voice telephone calls - all at once.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#29:1> If phone companies do nothing, eventually they'd even lose 'dome

of their mundane voice-telephone business to such competitors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#30:1> To catch or pass cable TV 's capacity, phone companies would have

to spend enormous amounts for construction.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#31:1> US West, for instance, says it will have to spend

&dollar; 500 million a year " for several decades" to replace all its wires, on top

of its usual upkeep and construction costs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#32:1> The other choice is to buy existing cable systems, also

expensive.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#33:1> That 's the route Southwestern Bell is taking, buying Hauser

Communications' cable systems for

&dollar; 650 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#34:1> Either way, the business of locally transmitting information or

entertainment over wires will get more competitive as phone companies and

cable companies go head-to-head in most areas.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#35:1> That will force prices down and squeeze profits, much as battles

between AT&T, MCI and Sprint chopped long-distance prices once that industry

became competitive in the 1980s.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#36:1> In the end, local phone companies won't be able to make enough

money on their new networks to justify the expense of building or buying them

- unless they can sell more than just a connection to a wire.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#37:1> They'll need t 'lldd value to the networks, probably by creating

and owning some of the programs and information on them.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#38:1> To get to that point, the phone companies need to buy into a media

giant like Time Warner or Viacom.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#39:1> " I don't think ( phone companies) can do it alone," says Peter

Shapiro, telecommunications consultant with Arthur D.Little.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#40:1> " All seven regional Bells plus a big independent phone company or

two are talking to Viacom and everybody else in the business of cable TV and

programming."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#41:1> That 's where the panic factor may be: There aren't a lot of

first-class media and entertainment companies to split among seven phone

companies.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#42:1> So executives are rushing to tie up some piece of the industry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#43:1> " I think you're going 're see myriad business combinations in the

next couple of years," US West 's McCormick says.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#44:1> Deals are already flying.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#45:1> A lot of them swirl around the takeover fight for Paramount, which

owns movie studios, TV programming and sports teams including the

Rangers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#46:1> NYNEX, the phone company in New York and New England, has agreed

to put

&dollar; 1.2 billion into Viacom, which is bidding for Paramount.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#47:1> Viacom owns cable TV systems and cable channels including Nickelodeon

and MTV, home of the Beavis & Butt-head show.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#48:1> Bidding against Viacom is a group headed by QVC Network.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#49:1> To boost cash available for the takeover, QVC is reportedly talking

with phone companies BellSouth ( which operates in Southern states),

Ameritech ( the Midwest) and Bell Atlantic ( mid-Atlantic states).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#50:1> On other fronts, Bell Atlantic would like to buy a cable TV

operator and has talked with dozens of them.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#51:1> Latest word says it is focusing on Cablevision Systems, a Long

Island, N.Y.-based cable company worth about

&dollar; 1.4 billion. Monday, Bell Atlantic announced it would invest about

&dollar; 1 billion in Grupo Iusacell, Mexico 's largest cellular phone company (

Company Spotlight, 3B).
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#52:1> Bell Atlantic officials haven't said whether that big outlay might

delay buying a cable firm.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#53:1> US West is the only phone company to close a major multimedia

investment so far.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#54:1> The company is transferring people to Orlando, Fla., where US West

and Time Warner will build an interactive cable system that is supposed to

let TV viewers get hundreds of channels, order movies, choose from dozens of

pay-per-view sporting events and send electronic mail.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#55:1> " We're sta 'reng to have our first management committee meetings,"

McCormick says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#56:1> " I feel good about the investment."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#57:1> Pacific Telesis has been the only regional phone company absent

from major dealmaking.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#58:1> Some deals are better than others.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#59:1> The US West-Time Warner deal, negotiated for six months, gets high

marks.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#60:1> " I was pleasantly surprised with the way US West structured it and

what it paid," says Steven Yanis, analyst at Kidder, Peabody.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#61:1> US West got a lot of specifics, including an equal partnership in

building the Orlando test system.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#62:1> By contrast, NYNEX " gets no control at all" for its vaguely

structured investment in Viacom, Yanis says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#63:1> Though analysts say NYNEX and Viacom had talked before, the deal was

rushed to make it part of the Paramount fight.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#64:1> At least the phone companies aren't taking their deals to

extremes, trying to meddle in management of businesses they don't know.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#65:1> And that 's not likely to change.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#66:1> " The investments are not too hands-on," analyst Yanis says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#67:1> " I can't see phone company executives driving around Hollywood

saying, 'Love you, babe.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#68:1> Let 's do lunch.' " </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#69:1> Regional telephone companies are making bold investments to move

into video delivery or programming.

<I>
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#79:2> <H> For women, land of opportunity</h> <h> Many are lured by hopes of

economic, personal equality</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#80:2> BODY:

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#81:2> Jennifer Ong came to the USA for school.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#82:2> Yuko Franklin came for love.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#83:2> Hiromi Suzuki came in search of better opportunities for women.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#84:2> Their stories differ, but each helps explain why a longtime trend

appears to have reversed, so that women now outnumber men among recent Asian

immigrants to the USA.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#85:2> Last year, says the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service,

there were 155 Filipino women for every 100 Filipino men immigrating here.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#86:2> For Koreans and Japanese, women outnumbered men 145-100.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#87:2> For Chinese immigrants, it was 122-100.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#88:2> Although men traditionally have outnumbered women immigrating to

the USA from all over the world, the new trend among Asians is particularly

striking: Once, Asian men outnumbered female Asian immigrants at least 3-1 or

4-1 says demographer Jeffrey Passel of the Washington, D.C., Urban

Institute.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#89:2> " They ( men) were brought in as either miners, railroad workers

or agricultural workers?so you had these bachelor communities," he says.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#90:2> Sociologists offer several explanations for the shift, including

new laws encouraging nurses to immigrate and marriages of Asian women and

U.S. servicemen and students.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#91:2> In addition, the rapid growth of low-skill, service jobs may make

it easier for women to find work in hotels or nursing homes, than for male

immigrants to get jobs in fields such as construction.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#92:2> But a growing number of middle-class Asian women also seem to be

coming here in search of something more ethereal: greater equality at work

and at home.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#93:2> When Hiromi Suzuki left Japan for California in 1979, she planned

to study to become an English teacher, gain work experience and then return

home.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#94:2> But when she went back to Japan in 1986, the transition was hard.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#95:2> " I felt too much stifled," Suzuki recalls.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#96:2> " You had to play a softer role."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#97:2> During one job interview, Suzuki was puzzled to watch her

potential Japanese employer blush red with embarrassment.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#98:2> It took a moment to realize her error: direct eye contact, a possible

sign of a sexual come-on.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#99:2> " I had been in America 5 1/2 years," Suzuki says, " and I forgot

how to see people in a Japanese way."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#100:2> So in 1988, Suzuki returned to San Francisco.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#101:2> " I miss people, but I never miss Japan," she says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#102:2> " I feel like I can be myself here."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#103:2> For some Asian women, immigrating means escaping the roles

prescribed by their societies, such as the expectation that they should be

married by a certain age.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#104:2> Jennifer Ong didn't come to California from the Philippines with

escape in mind, but in some ways her stay here has become one.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#105:2> Ong went to the University of San Francisco in 1986 to study.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#106:2> After graduation, she found a job as a reporter for the Philippine

News.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#107:2> Ong says she stayed partly because of better job opportunities,

partly because life here affords her more personal freedom.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#108:2> In the Philippines, if you don't marry, " you live with your

family until your hair turns gray," she says.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#109:2> " Here, it 's all right if you don't want to get married until you'r 're
40."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#110:2> Ong believes many Filipino women in her graduating class decided

the greater equality here outweighs the lure of home.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#111:2> Staying in the U.S. seemed to hold less appeal for the men, Ong

says.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#112:2> " Some of them belong to a certain social class," she explains.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#113:2> " Here, they feel like they'r 'reothing.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#114:2> In the Philippines, if they go to a certain social club, people know

who they are."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#115:2> But for some women, adjusting to the new life they seek can be

difficult.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#116:2> Yuko Franklin, now president of Nobiru-Kai Japanese Newcomer

Services in San Francisco, came to the USA in the early 1970s with her

husband, an American student she met in Tokyo.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#117:2> " Until ( Japanese women) actually come here and live, they have

a stereotyped expectation of what the U.S. will be - women 's lib, freedom and

individualism," says Franklin.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#118:2> " Mentally, you understand you have to be more independent...
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#119:2> It 's hard to change."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#120:2> Franklin speaks from experience.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#121:2> Once in San Francisco, her husband returned to school and asked her

to support him.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#122:2> In her first job, Franklin worked as a medical secretary in

charge of bill collection.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#123:2> A shy woman, Franklin could hardly have drawn an assignment less

suited to her personality.
<ICE-USA:W2C-016#124:2> But the experience taught her a valuable lesson about the necessity

of direct communication in America.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-016#125:2> " In Japan," Franklin says, " you don't really express your

feelings in words."</p> </I>
