<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-013#4:1> Media propaganda plays an integral role in motivating the general

public to participate in genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#5:1> Leaders often use the media to indoctrinate the masses with their

ideology and advance their political agenda ( Straus 9/29/2009).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#6:1> More specifically, hate speech dehumanizes the intended victim and

encourages discrimination ( Timmermann 354).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#7:1> Looking at propaganda is key to understanding whether a series of

atrocities were coincidental or part of a larger, deliberate plan.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#8:1> The insidious relationship between the mass media and genocide is

particularly evident in the genocide in Rwanda.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#9:1> In this paper, I will evaluate the role of Hassan Ngeze, a prominent

propagandist in the Rwandan genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#10:1> First, I will provide a basic historical overview of the conflict in

Rwanda.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#11:1> Second, I will examine Ngeze 's role as both editor-in-chief of the

extremist newspaper, Kangura, and as a powerful authority figure in the Hutu

regime.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#12:1> Third, I argue that Ngeze 's role was essential to creating a climate

of fear in Rwanda.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#13:1> By disseminating propaganda, he advocated for racial hatred and

incited the masses to commit horrific crimes against the Tutsis.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#14:1> Finally, I argue that Ngeze was rightfully tried under the Genocide

Convention for incitement to genocide, genocide and crimes against humanity.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#15:1> It is important to note that Ngeze was not decisive to the outcome of

genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#16:1> Other critical factors such as political instability, civil war, and

long-standing ethnic enmity between the Hutus and the Tutsis fostered a

volatile environment and fueled great brutality in Rwanda.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#17:1> However, by psychologically preparing the general population for

genocidal violence with propaganda, Ngeze was instrumental to inciting the

public to massacre the Tutsis with unprecedented speed, scope and

savagery.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#18:1> <h> Historical Context</h>

<p> Genocide in Rwanda emerged from a complex historical background between

the Hutus and the Tutsis.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#19:1> Examining the context strengthens our understanding of the Kangura 's

perspective and helps explain Ngeze 's role as a major Hutu leader during the

genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#20:1> Mahmood Mamdani argues that the reorganization of the colonial state

from 1926 to 1936 represents the key turning point in political violence and

conflict in Rwanda.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#21:1> To help govern the state, Belgian colonial rule legally stratified

the Rwandan population into two distinct groups.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#22:1> The Mwame, or the Rwandan king, identified the Tutsi population as

non-indigenous and gave them special privileges.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#23:1> As a result, the Tutsis began to " embrace the racialization of their

own identity as non-indigenous," ( 105).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#24:1> Meanwhile, the Hutus were legally required to carry an identity card

to mark their ethnic inferiority.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#25:1> Philip Gourevitch explains that " Hutu and Tutsi identities took

definition only in relationship to state power"those ideas were largely

framed as opposing negatives: a Hutu was what a Tutsi was not, and vise

versa," ( 50).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#26:1> Frustrated by their legal status, a Hutu political counterelite

emerged along with a Hutu nationalist movement.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#27:1> In 1959, the Hutus eventually gained political power through a social

revolution, founded the Republic of Rwanda in 1962 and forced the Tutsi

political elite to flee to neighboring countries ( Zahar 45).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#28:1> While in exile, rebel Tutsi forces banded together to form the

Rwandan Patriotic Force ( RPF) and plotted to regain power ( Wallenstein

353). </p>

<p> Although genocide did not erupt until 1994, major episodes of violence

occurred in Rwanda in 1959, 1963, 1966, 1973 and systematically from 1990 to

1994 ( Des Forges 65).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#29:1> The RPF invasion from Uganda in October 1990 played a significant

role in goading anti-Tutsi propaganda.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#30:1> In addition, economic decline, popular unrest, Hutu discontent and

international pressure on Rwanda to become a multiparty democracy, all

threatened the power of the extremist Rwandan government and exacerbated

ethnic tensions between the Hutus and the Tutsis, ( Kidder 270).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#31:1> Hutu political elites saw the extermination of Tutsis and their Hutu

and Belgian " accomplices" as the ultimate solution to Rwanda 's problems, and

used propagandist media to voice this hatred and mobilize violence (

Wallenstein 392).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#32:1> The RPF invasion helped the Hutu extremists gain legitimacy, popular

support, and " provided an ideal basis for a well-orchestrated campaign of

virulent anti-Tutsi propaganda" ( Kidder 270).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#33:1> Immediately following the invasion, Ngeze founded the newspaper,

Kangura, and published an article warning that the RPF were preparing to wage

a war against the Hutus that " would leave no survivors" ( Des Forges 78).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#34:1> Kangura continued to advocate for ethnic hatred against the RPF and

the Tutsis through the onset of genocide when Rwandan president Juvenal

Habyarimana and Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira were assassinated on

April 6, 1994 ( Des Forges 66).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#35:1> By July 1994, 500,000 Tutsis were massacred, which accounted for 75&percent;

of the total Tutsi population in Rwanda ( Straus 12/1/2009). </p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#36:1> <h> Ngeze 's Specific Role</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-013#37:1> As editor-in-chief of the propaganda newspaper, Kangura, Ngeze

had exclusive control over the paper 's publications and wrote many editorials

( " Prosecutor v. Nahimana et. al." 2775).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#38:1> Thus, Ngeze was responsible for what was printed in Kangura and the

effect of those words on Rwandan society.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#39:1> Kangura echoed the state 's racist creed and utilized lies and

exaggerations to instill a sense of fear, hatred and paranoia in Rwandan

society.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#40:1> For example, Kangura alleged that there were mass gravesites of

innocent Hutus to develop an anti-Tutsi sentiment ( Wallenstein 393).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#41:1> The paper consistently republished the Ten Bahutu Commandants, a

violent document that called for Hutu ethnic and racial dominance, hatred for

the Tutsi minority and that encouraged persecution of Tutsi women, ( "

Prosecutor v. Ngeze" 18).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#42:1> Moreover, Kangura painted the Hutus as innocent victims in a

Tutsi-led genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#43:1> Alison Des Forges describes this phenomenon as " accusation in a

mirror," meaning that the " party which is using terror will accuse the enemy

of using terror" ( 66).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#44:1> In this case, Kangura persuaded readers that it was the Hutu 's

responsibility to " erase the enemy within" and fight to preserve the pure

Rwandan nation ( Wallenstein 392).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#45:1> The media demonized the Tutsis by calling them names such as "

cockroaches, feudal lords, snakes, subversive and the enemy," and convinced

the Hutu majority that pre-emptive action against the Tutsi population was

necessary for their own self-defense ( Timmermann 354).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#46:1> In the article A Cockroach Cannot Give Birth to a Butterfly, for

example, Kangura wrote: " A cockroach gives birth to another cockroach"a

Tutsi is someone who has a sweet tongue but whose wickedness is

indescribable.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#47:1> A Tutsi is someone whose desire for revenge is insatiable; someone

who is unpredictable, someone who laughs whereas he is suffering," (

Timmermann 364).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#48:1> In addition to the Tutsi minority, the aggressive propaganda campaign

was also aimed at Hutus who opposed the Hutu Power ideology.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#49:1> These Hutus were depicted as " accomplices" of the Tutsis and were

largely targeted in the genocide ( Gourevitch 18).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#50:1> Finally, by publishing lists of specific Tutsi and moderate Hutu

targets in Kangura, Ngeze incited the militia and members of the community to

violently eliminate the Tutsi population ( Wallenstein 392). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-013#51:1> Ngeze was an influential public figure in Rwanda during the

genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#52:1> As a founding and active member of the Coalition for the Defense of

the Republic ( CDR) political party, Ngeze openly declared his extremist Hutu

ideology and exercised authority over the militia groups, Interahamwe ( MRND)

and Impuzamugambi ( CDR) ( " Prosecutor v. Ngeze" 11).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#53:1> For example, in 1991, Ngeze distributed weapons to Hutu fighters and

helped train them to massacre Tutsis in Gisenyi prefecture ( " Prosecutor v.

Ngeze" 15).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#54:1> Additionally, in April 1994, Ngeze traveled with the Interahamwe to "

identify the Tutsi and their 'accomplices' and kill them on the spot"[He

also] took part in killings of Tutsi at Commune Rouge.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#55:1> He supervised the mass graves, commended the Interahamwe on their 'good

work' and encouraged them to continue the killing," ( " Prosecutor v. Ngeze"

20).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#56:1> Ngeze and Kangura worked closely with the extremist radio station,

Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines ( RTLM), as " partners in a Hutu

coalition," ( " Prosecutor v. Nahimana et. al. 2773).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#57:1> Ngeze was a shareholder in RTLM and served as their Gisenyi

correspondent.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#58:1> When interviewed on RTLM, Ngeze consistently called for the

extermination of the Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and defended his extremist

Hutu ideology, ( " Prosecutor v. Ngeze" 14). </p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#59:1> <h> Whether Ngeze 's Role was Essential to the Outcome</#>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-013#60:1> By perpetrating a climate of fear and hatred, Ngeze played a

significant role in creating the conditions that led to genocide in Rwanda (

Timmermann 364).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#61:1> Through Kangura, Ngeze conditioned the public to loathe the Tutsis on

the basis of their ethnicity, and convinced them that pre-emptive action was

necessary for their survival.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#62:1> Thus, by the time genocide broke out in April 1994, the masses were

motivated and prepared to systematically murder Tutsis at a blistering speed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#63:1> Kangura was highly influential in Rwanda for many reasons.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#64:1> First, although only 66 percent of Rwandans are literate, those who

do not know how to read were either read to, or looked at cartoons " which

were so graphic that they could not be misinterpreted," ( Des Forges 67).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#65:1> Second, Wallenstein argues, " in times of instability, people tend to

be more reliant on mass media for information and guidance.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#66:1> They may know of crucial events only through mass media.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#67:1> In 1994 Rwanda, communications and travel became all but impossible,"

( 389).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#68:1> Although 95&percent; of the population lives in rural areas of Rwanda and the

government was able to reach them using Kangura to preach their ideology.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#69:1> The paper was widely distributed by urban workers who carried copies

with them when they went home to the countryside for the weekends ( Des

Forges 67).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#70:1> In the 1990s, Kangura and the main radio station, RTLM, became the

main source of news for the nation and framed how the public should treat the

Tutsis. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-013#71:1> Some argue that since the genocide in Rwanda was mostly committed

by civilians to civilians, authority figures like Ngeze should not be

responsible for the colossal death toll.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#72:1> However, because conformity was deeply embedded in Rwandan culture,

Ngeze 's propaganda and his role as a community figurehead were especially

influential.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#73:1> A Kigali lawyer, Francois Xavier Nkurunziza explained to Gourevitch

that, " in Rwandan history, everyone obeys authority"The people of

influence"may think that they didn't kill because they didn't take life with

their own hands, but the people were looking to them for their orders.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#74:1> And in Rwanda, an order can be given very quietly," ( 23).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#75:1> The masses looked to leaders like Ngeze to direct them and tell them

how to behave.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#76:1> Ngeze used this to his advantage through the power of his words,

causing the public to believe that every Tutsi was a grave and imminent

threat.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#77:1> This relates to Stanley Milgram 's theory that obedience drives people

to commit horrific crimes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#78:1> When there is a legitimate authority figure, Milgram argues that

people will obey without question ( Straus 9/29/09).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#79:1> In Rwanda, Ngeze served as a legitimate authority figure and gave out

directives knowing that the people would comply without question.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#80:1> Similarly, Christopher Browning argues that people who commit

atrocities were often just following orders " or " atrocity by policy."
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#81:1> As seen in Rwanda, war helped Ngeze racially stereotype and

dehumanize the Tutsis through propaganda.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#82:1> Browning also emphasizes that few perpetrators did anything to stop

the genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#83:1> Ngeze was able to mobilize the community to massacre Tutsis through

both his actions and his inactions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#84:1> According to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, " Ngeze

knew that the articles published in Kangura were inciting, aiding and

abetting the local population and the militia groups to exterminate all the

Tutsis"and failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent

such acts."
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#85:1> Additionally, Ngeze " knew that the articles, speeches or interviews

published in Kangura resulted in widespread massacres of the Tutsi population

and the murder of numerous moderate Hutus" and was therefore a necessary

vehicle in facilitating the violence ( 19).</p>
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#86:1> <h> Genocide Convention</#>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-013#87:1> Genocide first became an international crime under the Genocide

Convention in 1948.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#88:1> The convention defines genocide as " the deliberate and systematic

destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or

national group," ( Power 62).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#89:1> This law was first enforced at the International Criminal Tribunal

for Rwanda ( ICTR) after the 1994 genocide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#90:1> ICTR examined the link between mass media and genocide " setting a

precedent that hate speech is legally one of international law 's most heinous

crimes ( " Prosecutor v. Nahimana et. al." 2769).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#91:1> The ICTR Appeals Chamber also ruled that " hate speech directed

against a group and inspired by discriminatory motives"whether on the basis

of ethnicity or any other basis"violates the right to respect for the human

dignity of the members of the group and thus constitutes discrimination in

fact," ( Timmermann 364).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#92:1> In 2003, ICTR convicted Ngeze, along with two other media executives,

Ferdinand Nahimana and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, for genocide, incitement to

genocide and crimes against humanity ( " Prosecutor v. Ngeze" 25).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#93:1> In accordance with the Trial Chamber 's rulings, I agree that Ngeze

was guilty for his involvement in Kangura and his individual criminal

actions. </p>

<p> To determine the necessary elements of direct and public incitement to

commit genocide, an actor must publicly provoke a number of individuals to

commit a criminal action, ( Wallenstein 394).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#94:1> In Rwanda, Kangura satisfies this requirement because it is a form of

mass communication meant to reach the community at large.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#95:1> Unlike other key actors, Ngeze was able to voice his extremist

ideology through a major outlet to quickly reach a wide audience.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#96:1> Propagandists often argue that they were simply exercising their

right to freedom of expression, which makes it very difficult to prove their

incitement to harm.
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#97:1> " Yet the ideal of freedom of expression does not justify undermining

public order"In times of war and armed conflict, unlimited freedom of

expression may serve to subvert and sabotage the integrity of the nation and

inspire crimes as horrifying as genocide," ( Wallenstein 388).
<ICE-USA:W1A-013#98:1> Interestingly, the Tribunal notes that speech " aligned with state

power rather than in opposition to it deserves less protection to ensure that

minorities without equal means of defense are not endangered," ( " Prosecutor

v. Nahimana et. al." 2772). Kangura was state owned and directly supported by

the Hutu extremist government. </p> </I>
