<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#1:1> It is a fatal assumption to ascribe these calamities exclusively

to the errors and infirmities of the Irish character; and set about

alternately coercing and cajoling, as if it were a child or a maniac we had

to deal with.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#2:1> No empire has ever yet treated a whole section of its subjects as

inferior in heart and mind without incurring the condemnation of posterity. (

2)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#3:1> This question of race is the very last topic that English writers

and politicians should have broached. . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#4:1> The fallacy of referring Irish evils to Celtic causation, is one very

likely to be wiped off in blood. ( 3)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#5:1> The 150th anniversary of the Irish potato famine in autumn 1996 is

already stirring a highly emotional reappraisal of the history of English

treatment of Ireland.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#6:1> The belief that the racist English refused substantial famine relief

to Ireland because of their hatred for the Celtic race is widespread both

within and outside the scholarly community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#7:1> Recent demands by the Irish Republic for an official British "

apology" for the famine reflect this belief, which sometimes extends to the

assertion that the English sought to perpetrate racial genocide by

engineering mass starvation in Ireland.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#8:1> This understanding of the famine poisons English-Irish relations to

this day, just as memories of 1641 or 1798 stirred anger and bitterness in

the Victorian period.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#9:1> Lewis Perry Curtis, Jr. is the most prominent of many historians

who conclude that race was the defining element in nineteenth-century English

perceptions of the Irish.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#10:1> The English, according to Curtis and others, looked with a

self-conscious sense of Saxon superiority at what they considered to be a

childlike and inferior but dangerous Celtic race.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#11:1> This attitude, it is assumed, shaped policy and lay at the root of

Irish oppression.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#12:1> Irish nationalist historians have used these arguments to place their

people among other victims of colonial racism and genocide in Africa, Asia

and North America. ( 4)
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#13:1> Anti-Irish racism in this sense appears as an inevitable

manifestation of colonialism.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#14:1> It is easy to forget, however, that prejudice takes many forms,

not all of them based on a concrete conception of the victim as a

biologically distinct race.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#15:1> Those who forget this fact have trouble interpreting English policy

toward Ireland in the 1840s.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#16:1> Some writers misjudge, for example, the motivations behind the

insistence of many Englishmen in the early famine period that Celt and Saxon

and even Protestant and Catholic were fundamentally equal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#17:1> Liz Curtis hails John Stuart Mill, who repeatedly rejected the notion

that the Irish were racially inferior, as one of the few Englishmen who

understood the true nature of " British exploitation" of Ireland. ( 5)
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#18:1> Mill also, however, asserted at the height of the famine that</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#19:1> We must give over telling the Irish that it is our business to

find food for them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#20:1> We must tell them, now and forever, that it is their business. (

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#21:1> K.D.M.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#22:1> Snell sees Alexander Somerville 's lack of religious or racial bigotry

as evidence that Somerville was not " prejudiced" against the Irish. ( 7)
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#23:1> Yet Somerville also wrote in early 1847 that the starving Irish were

willingly foregoing food and using English charity money to buy arms, and

that continuing to give them relief would only " make the people think that

the government should do everything."(8)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#24:1> British perceptions of the Irish in the 1840s were more complex

than they may at first appear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#25:1> During the first months of the crisis, advocates of the tight-fisted

government policy drew on what may be called a Liberal discourse of moral

improvement which explicitly denied the racial inferiority of the Irish and

saw the famine as a Providential opportunity to civilize and improve them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#26:1> The Liberal understanding of human nature gave the great majority of

the public confidence that Irish degradation was moral and not biological in

nature, and thus subject to change.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#27:1> Forcing the Irish to fend for themselves in time of dearth thus

appeared as a useful and necessary moral lesson for a people with such

potential for improvement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#28:1> Frustration at the apparently obstinate unwillingness of the Irish to

improve as a result of the famine led an increasingly large portion of the

English public to believe, however, that the Irish were an irredeemably

inferior race for whom no amount of tutoring would do any good.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#29:1> The years that followed saw resurgence of racialist discourse on

Ireland that would persist for the remainder of the century.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#30:1> The " condition of Ireland question" was a matter of great public

attention in the years preceding the famine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#31:1> Ireland was, most people agreed, a country of immense economic

potential existing in the lowest possible state of degradation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#32:1> Fish teemed off her shores, her harbors were some of the best in the

world, and her land was capable of producing excellent crops.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#33:1> Her people, however, seemed unwilling to take advantage of the

natural resources at their fingertips, living instead in abject poverty

attended by a barbaric state of mind.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#34:1> External factors, not inherent flaws in the Irish character, were

considered to be responsible for this state of affairs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#35:1> Particularly to blame was the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, as it

perpetuated " the system which has given to the character of the Celt some of

the qualities peculiar to a slave population,"(10) ruling the Irish peasantry

as an alien people incapable of integration into civilized society.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#36:1> The worst thing about " the system" was that it had stood in the

way of the complete union of the English and Irish people.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#37:1> This union was held to be the natural consummation of God 's will; and

what God had placed together no man could break apart:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#38:1> The condition of Ireland is, directly, the condition of the

British empire.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#39:1> No legislative union can tighten - no Utopian separation could

dissolve - that intimate and close connexion between the two islands which

has been formed by the hand of nature, and consolidated by the operations of

time . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#40:1> Each year cements by closer fusion the twain branches of the Saxon

and the Celtic stocks . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#41:1> Whilst our passions are the most excited, and our jealousy the most

vigilant, terror and passion are found equally unavailing to keep those apart

whom a higher Power than man 's has joined by the contiguity of position and

the bond of mutual dependence. ( 11)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#42:1> The landed aristocracy of Ireland thus acted against natural law

in seeking to perpetuate divisions among the peoples of the British family of

nations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#43:1> Unlike the larger of the British Isles, where Saxon, Norman and Roman

had " amalgamated," and were in the process of doing so with the Welsh and

Scots, in Ireland the races had remained separate. ( 12)
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#44:1> The blame for this, it was supposed, rested on Anglo-Irish and

English policy as practiced from the twelfth through the eighteenth

centuries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#45:1> These policies, by segregating the two peoples socially, racially and

religiously, had kept them artificially divided and had worked to prevent the

proper consummation of the union.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#46:1> These errors could only be rectified, it was believed, by

bringing the Irish more fully under English law.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#47:1> The Act of Union was only the first step; measures to strengthen this

legislation through the introduction of measures such as a Poor Law on the

English model were necessary.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#48:1> The ultimate aim in doing so was " the blending and amalgamation of

the two peoples."(13)
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#49:1> Or, as James Grant put it, " There is one way, and one way only, of

crushing repeal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#50:1> That is by rendering Ireland in reality what it is nominally - an

integral part of the British empire," instead of ruling it as " a conquered

province."(14)
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#51:1> The Poor Law Extension Act of 1847 was enacted during the famine with

this end in mind.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#52:1> For all of the English admissions of the shortcomings of British

rule in Ireland through 1800, it was considered inconceivable that the Irish

could govern themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#53:1> The only potential leaders of an Irish government, the English

assumed, would be the Anglo-Irish aristocracy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#54:1> Attacks on repeal of the Union therefore necessarily involved

denigration of the ability of this class to rule effectively.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#55:1> They were therefore roundly excoriated by the English government and

public as lazy, profligate, and brutal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#56:1> The Times proclaimed that</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#57:1> the prime cause why the Irish peasantry have been reduced to

their present level must be sought for in the neglect and unthrift of past

generations of claret- drinking, writ-despising, landlords.(15)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#58:1> In this respect the landlords had also become the scapegoats for

English misgovernment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#59:1> As Alexander Somerville put it,</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#60:1> It would be in the natural order of things for an Irish

parliament of Irish landlords to legislate for themselves and against their

tenantry and the great body of the people. ( 16)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#61:1> Peasants and aristocrats could therefore obviously not supervise

the regeneration of Ireland.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#62:1> The assumed absence of a native Irish middle-class ruled out the

possibility that natives of any sort could rule the country.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#63:1> The possibility that an Irish middle-class could emerge at any point

in the future was simply not considered.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#64:1> The Irish had no choice, therefore, but to look to the English and

Scotch middle classes to govern and regenerate Ireland.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#65:1> Somerville expressed this attitude in the form of a hypothetical

lecture of a pro-repeal Irishman:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#66:1> your parliament, if you had it, would be entirely composed of

landlords and lawyers, neither of whom as yet have done you any service, but

much mischief . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#67:1> Feudalism and territorial representation is on the decline.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#68:1> It will decline more and more in England every year; but you would

restore it in Ireland by an Irish parliament of landlords and law - jobbers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#69:1> You have no middle class to control them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#70:1> It is to the new current of legislation from the commercial classes

of England that you must look for real substantial benefits to Ireland. (

17)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#71:1> Confidence in the English middle-class as the ultimate source of

all social and moral progress combined with the Liberal belief that all human

beings were capable of moral education and improvement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#72:1> With English help, therefore, the Irish people would not be doomed to

forever exist in a state of semi-barbarism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#73:1> Celts, no less than any other European people, would ultimately prove

responsive to Liberal treatment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#74:1> Liberals denied, in Somerville 's words, " the natural incapacity of

the Celts for becoming a commercial people" or " the impossibility of

improving the Celtic population."(18)
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#75:1> English thrift and forethought would, it was assumed, be transmitted

to the Irish and uplift their physical and mental states to a substantial

degree.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#76:1> Even so, though the Irish were not considered " inferior," it was

assumed that on their improvement the Irish could not simply dispose of

English support and begin to fend for themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#77:1> They were instead expected to reciprocate by settling down in

contented submission, sharing and enjoying the fruits of economic prosperity

that would follow on realization of the union.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#78:1> Despite its apparent optimism, the ultimate purpose of Liberal

discourse on Ireland was to justify perpetual English rule under the guise of

the creation of a British family of nations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#79:1> Critics like Daniel Owen-Madden argued that adherents of this view

erred by failing to recognize the inherent difference of the Celtic people,

which made ruling them through English laws and institutions a mistake:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#80:1> There is a class of Imperialists who propose to govern Ireland

without the slightest regard to local feelings, or to Irish prejudices.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#81:1> They would wish to obliterate Ireland in the map of the Empire, and

to substitute West Britain.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#82:1> They would first deride all Irish instincts, malign all Irish

character, and then proceed to treat a concursive and semi-celtic population

as if it inherited the individualism and characteristic phlegm of English

nature.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#83:1> This school of Imperialists is one made up of Whigs, Whig-Radicals,

and Economists. ( 19)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#84:1> A fundamental paradox did lay at the heart of the Liberal

discourse.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#85:1> Although the principles of social and economic Liberalism could not

admit that the Irish ( or, indeed any people) were unimprovable, the case for

English rule depended on the continual subservience of the Irish people.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#86:1> Englishmen professed their desire to fully assimilate Ireland into

the British family of nations, ( 20) but also desired to maintain the

colonial relationship of the two islands.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#87:1> Were the Irish ever improved to the extent of being admitted as full

moral and physical equals of the English, their desire for independence could

no longer be denied; but to justify their subservience on the basis of

inherent racial inferiority would have been to reject the dogma of the

improvability of all men.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#88:1> Somehow the Irish needed to be represented, not as racially inferior

to or incompatible with the English, but as necessarily and perpetually

playing the subservient role in the Union.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#89:1> A conceptual framework for reconciling these paradoxes was at

hand in the rhetoric of marriage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#90:1> Lynda Nead has explained the Victorian concept of marriage in the

following manner:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-009#91:1> The underlying principle of gender division in the nineteenth

century was that the two sexes were different and complementary.
<ICE-USA:W2B-009#92:1> Woman was never described as inferior to man; rather, she was

different, and her differences were to be valued since they entirely

complemented male attributes.(21)</p> </I>
