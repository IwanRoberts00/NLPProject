<ICE-USA:W1A-001#2:1> <h> by: <@> Shanaynay Morris</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#3:1> Spring time is here yet again.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#4:1> Outside the trees are green and luscious, the birds are singing a

welcome song for the warm air and the blooming flowers.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#5:1> Everyone seems to want to be outdoors more than they did a few weeks

ago, and they seem to be in more cheerful spirits.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#6:1> And, as the old saying goes, " Love is in the air.?
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#7:1> But for me, when this time of year comes around an unstoppable sense

of sadness always creeps upon me, and tears well up in my eyes for no

apparent reason, and a lump occupies my throat causing my voice to break

periodically.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#8:1> This happens every spring because I remember a time five years ago

when love was in the air for me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#9:1> I was on the verge of falling head over heels in love with a close

friend I had known since I was three years old, when it all came to a

screeching halt that changed my life forever.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#10:1> I first met Eric in the church nursery when I was three years old

during Vacation Bible School.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#11:1> He and I were the only " big kids" in the nursery class.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#12:1> We weren't big enough to be in the preschool class, but we were too

big to be babies so we couldn't take naps and drink bottles.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#13:1> Instead, we had to rely on each other for companionship and

entertainment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#14:1> For the whole week, we would share crayons and color pictures of

Jesus, Moses, and Noah together, and then argue over who had colored the

prettiest.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#15:1> We would build huge castle out of stacking blocks and then knock them

down.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#16:1> Every time he would crash through the walls, his reddish-brown hair

would fall into his eyes so he couldn't see where he was going.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#17:1> And, I would get trampled.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#18:1> One time when we went outside to get cookies and Kool-aid, I was

running and fell down.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#19:1> I looked down at my bloody, skinned knee and started to cry.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#20:1> Eric came over and while petting my hand, asked me if I needed him to

call an ambulance to unhurt my leg.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#21:1> By the end of the week we were inseparable, and continued to play

together all the time as he conveniently lived just up the road from me.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#22:1> When we started first grade together, he was there to keep me

from being scared according to my mom.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#23:1> But, I think I helped him more than he did me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#24:1> I was ready to go to school, but Eric cried when his mom dropped him

off.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#25:1> So, it was my turn to pet him on the head and call an ambulance to

unhurt him.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#26:1> The next seven years of elementary school we spent together in the

same class every day talking at lunch, playing at recess, borrowing pencils

from each other, and letting him copy my math homework sometimes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#27:1> He couldn't multiply to save his life at times.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#28:1> Since the eighth grade was incorporated into the high school

curriculum back then, I was apprehensive about our friendship remaining since

there was a chance that we wouldn't be in the same classes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#29:1> I was afraid that we wouldn't be able to talk very much or spend very

much time together.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#30:1> I was also afraid that we would grow apart because we wouldn't have

as much in common anymore.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#31:1> But, fate intervene and we had all six classes together our eighth

grade year as well as our ninth grade year.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#32:1> We spent time together and was always there when we needed each

other.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#33:1> I made sure I was there for him the summer before our freshmen

year when his dad died slowly of lung cancer.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#34:1> I watched him grow up so quickly.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#35:1> Almost overnight he went from being a thirteen year old boy to the

man of the house.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#36:1> Everything about him changed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#37:1> He became a much more serious person about life.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#38:1> He tried his best to make sure that everyone else had something to

laugh and smile about whether he did or not.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#39:1> He grew four inches in height during our freshmen year, and for once

was taller than me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#40:1> His face began to take on the appearance of a young man, the chubby

cheeks adorned with dimples melted away.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#41:1> The once carefree brown hair was now neatly in place, the shorter cut

took away his red highlights.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#42:1> His green eyes in the past had been mischievously bright, but were

now almost hard and serious due to the pain he had felt, and would never get

over.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#43:1> In public, Eric acted like he was coping with his father 's long

illness and death, but I knew how hurt he was and how much he wanted to be

with his father, no matter what the cost.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#44:1> I knew that he was only being strong for his mother and little

sister, and he did everything he could to fill his father 's shoes for them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#45:1> He took it upon himself to do without the normal materialistic "

necessities" of the typical teenager.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#46:1> He saved his allowance in case an emergency ever arose and they

needed the money.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#47:1> He was so noble and brave, yet he never felt like he was doing enough

to make his dad proud.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#48:1> I tried to tell him he was doing the best he could and that was what

mattered.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#49:1> I wanted him to understand he was just a kid and his father would not

have wanted him to lose his youth because he had lost his father.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#50:1> But, his heart was so full of pain that he no longer seemed to be the

friend I had once known.<./p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#51:1> When he turned sixteen during our sophomore year in high school,

things began to get better for him.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#52:1> He bought himself a car with the money he had saved and got an after

school job.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#53:1> He was slowly adjusting to the loss of his father.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#54:1> Once again, he became carefree and fun-loving.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#55:1> We would go riding around town together, and talk about everything.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#56:1> I helped to fix him up with another one of my close friend.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#57:1> Eventhough it didn't work out and he had the worst date imaginable

with her, it gave us something to laugh about together.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#58:1> He told me it was too bad my friend hadn't been more like me, because

I was the ideal girl he wanted to go out with.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#59:1> But, we were too good of friends to risk losing our friendship in

case things didn't work out.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#60:1> And we both agreed to this, in words anyway.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#61:1> We began to go out more and more, and everyone was asking us if

we were a couple.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#62:1> We would just smile and say " We'r 'renly friends.?
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#63:1> Yet, things began to happen between us and I felt this deep and close

bond developing between us.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#64:1> I think he felt it too. We began to talk about our futures.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#65:1> Both of us wanted to be lawyers, and he said he would create his own

firm, and that he would let me be a partner so he couldn't be accused of any

sexual discrimination.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#66:1> We would spend all day at school together and then come home and

spend all night talking on the phone, supposedly doing homework.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#67:1> One night when we were riding around together, he was so quiet

and distant.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#68:1> I kept asking him what was wrong, but he would say nothing.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#69:1> Then, out of the blue, he asked me if I thought that if he were to

die tomorrow would his little two year old nephew ( his older half-sister 's

son) remember who " Uncle Eric" was.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#70:1> And, he wanted to known if anyone would miss him, if he was gone

forever.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#71:1> I told him that everyone would remember him and miss him, but I told

him that he was being silly because nothing was going to happen to him.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#72:1> When he dropped me off at home that night, he leaned over and pecked

me on the lips before I got out of the car.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#73:1> At that moment, I knew that we were on our way to becoming more than

friends.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#74:1> On May 11, this all came to a stop.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#75:1> That Friday afternoon, Eric had said at school that he would do

anything to get out of taking his finals, and he got his wish.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#76:1> That Friday night, he went out with the guys and never made it home.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#77:1> At approximately 11:30 that night his truck went off the road and hit

a tree.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#78:1> At 6:45 the next morning, he was found dead.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#79:1> My heart broke in two when I found out that he had laid on the side

of the road for hours slowly bleeding to death.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#80:1> He had not been killed instantly, and because his truck was black and

had went off the road on a decline into the woods, no one had seen it until

the sun came up.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#81:1> My mind can not forget this image of him lying helplessly bleeding in

pain, and no one came to help him until it was too late.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#82:1> Three days later, on May 14 - my sixteenth birthday, Eric was

buried.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#83:1> And along with him, my first love was covered with dirt and gone

before it really had a chance to begin.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#84:1> So as those dates draw closer, tears and brushed aside pain fill my

heart.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#85:1> It took me over four years to allow myself to care about a guy as

much as I did Eric.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#86:1> I decided at his burial that I never wanted to feel that kind of pain

again.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#87:1> I hated to hear the saying " it is better to have loved and lost,

then to never had loved at all." then, but now when I think about Eric, I

have something to remember that is very special.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#88:1> And that memory will never die eventhough Eric did.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#89:1> So now, once again I am falling in love, but I still can't help but

wonder " what if...".</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W1A-001#90:2> <h> LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW TO MOTHER NATURE'S SOUL</h>
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#91:2> <h> <@> Cyndi Vasco</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#92:2> Have you ever stopped what you were doing, opened a window,

thrown off your shoes and just looked out?
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#93:2> I do not mean sat there to be lazy and fall asleep, or to watch

television.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#94:2> I mean sat down and really looked out a window and soaked up nature.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#95:2> If not, might I suggest a daily dose of window watching. Window

watching may be done from any window in any room of any house.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#96:2> You may wonder, why would you want to look out a window on your spare

time when you could be watching TV, listening to the radio, reading a book,

or spending time with your boy or girlfriend.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#97:2> Here is my answer . . . WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING, OUTSTANDING,

POWERFUL, and BRILLIANT LIFE!!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#98:2> I would like to take you now to the window from which I have been

doing the majority of my window watching.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#99:2> It is a large window located on the top of a two story house.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#100:2> The surroundings of the window are not important, and neither is

what the window faces.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#101:2> What matters about this window is the life that can be seen through

it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#102:2> From your window you may notice a number of miracles, just as I

have.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#103:2> Notice the trees that not too long ago were cold and bare are now

beginning to bloom pink and purple.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#104:2> Isn't it amazing how mother nature causes the changes of the trees?
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#105:2> See the sun shine from the corner of your window hitting the silky

webs of worms that are starting to hang from the trees.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#106:2> How do they do that?
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#107:2> The birds will glide into your sight, as they enjoy the warm breeze

that intertwines with their wings, keeping them in flight.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#108:2> As the afternoon becomes evening, feel the warm breeze begin to turn

cool as it wisps by your face.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#109:2> You can smell the sweet sent of nectar as your deep breaths allow

the air to dance with your lungs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-001#110:2> Now, place your bare feet on the ledge of the window and let

them be replenished from their long day.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#111:2> Your eyes get fixated on the shadows dancing on the ground, caused

by sashaying trees and happy clouds You begin to scan the scene in which your

window surrounds.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#112:2> Look how quickly that yellow spider can maneuver all eight of it 's

legs as it runs down the shingles, hot to the touch.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#113:2> Leg, leg, leg, leg, leg, leg, leg, leg.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#114:2> Seeds, pedals and leaves float by with happy ants on the waves.
<ICE-USA:W1A-001#115:2> Hear the startling calls of animals aroused by the warm summer

day.</p> </I>
