<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#1:1> Although Rotel may not be a familiar brand name to many American

audiophiles, it has long had a solid reputation in Britain for producing

good-sounding, moderate-priced equipment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#2:1> This Japanese company has now introduced a high- end line in the

United States; the line includes a tuner, a phono preamp and equalizer, a

passive preamp, and the two products under review, the RHB-10 power amplifier

and RHA- 10 preamplifier.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#3:1> The amp sells for about

&dollar;2,700, and the preamp for about

&dollar;1,800.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#4:1> I initially approached these two components with some trepidation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#5:1> Far too many Japanese companies' attempts at high-end amps and preamps

have emphasized features over sound quality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#6:1> The technical excellence of such units seemed to be the product of a

committee of engineers unsupervised by anyone who actually listens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#7:1> The end result has been products that have outstanding specs and test

performance but that fail to provide musicality to match their technical

achievements.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#8:1> The RHB-10 and RHA-10, however, combine both technical and musical

excellence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#9:1> Rotel has produced two excellent high-end units and has a design team

that can listen!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#10:1> My first indication of how good the RHB-10 power amplifier is

came from my eldest son.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#11:1> He does a great deal of my unpacking and hookup work, and has gotten

used to constant changes in my electronics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#12:1> He normally greets new amplifiers with total indifference, but when

he turned on the RHB-10, he reacted immediately by saying, " That sounds

really good!"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#13:1> Extended listening with a wide range of speakers confirmed my

son 's praise.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#14:1> The RHB-10 is rated at 200 watts into 8 ohms, 330 watts into 4 ohms,

and a higher power level into 2 ohms.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#15:1> Such ratings are not uncommon for today 's transistor power

amplifiers, but the amps often prove disappointing in terms of driving

difficult loads and are unpredictable in terms of performance with particular

speakers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#16:1> The RHB-10 exhibited neither of these problems.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#17:1> It performed well with my Apogee Divas, Thiel CS-5s, Quad ESL-63s,

Spendor BC-1s, and a pair of custom-built small monitors that have extremely

demanding crossovers and impedance.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#18:1> I experience no problems with the amp 's power- protection

circuitry, even when committing the usual round of " stupid reviewer tricks"

during various hook-ups.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#19:1> On the other hand, internal wiring changes allow you to bypass this

protection if you are a purist who demands the minimum circuitry possible

between amplifier and speakers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#20:1> The RHB-10 is superbly built, and its styling is more typical of

European components than it is of Japanese.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#21:1> If you open the chassis, you find two mono amplifiers with large

individual toroidal power amplifiers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#22:1> Each channel has a very sophisticated and highly regulated power

supply, and the gain stages are laid out in a symmetrical design, with a

fully complementary push-pull differential amplifier that feeds two

emitter-followers stages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#23:1> The output stages use a Darlington quadruple parallel circuit that is

also completely symmetrical and is mirrored top, bottom, left, and right.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#24:1> The RHB-10 has exceptionally large heat-sinks, a clean circuit

layout, and excellent standards of construction.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#25:1> Rotel has used high-quality passive components, such as 1% Visha&percent;

resistors, LCR/Wima capacitors, and high purity copper wiring.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#26:1> Most important, the Rotel RHB-10 is musical.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#27:1> It has an overall timbre that is just slightly warm, where most

Japanese electronics tend to be just a bit lean or analytic.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#28:1> It neither rolls off the highs nor exaggerates the lower midrange and

upper bass at the expense of bass depth, control, or power.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#29:1> The RHB-10 is not an " ultimate" amp in the sense of a Classe

Audio M 1000 or Krell MLA-300.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#30:1> It cannot deliver the same kind of deep bass extension and dynamics,

but its bass is very good indeed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#31:1> Music that often seems slightly dead in the bass and lower midrange

with mid-fi or moderate-quality high-end power amplifiers, such as strong

bass lines in jazz and rock, comes alive with the Rotel.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#32:1> At the same time, percussion does not lose detail, and guitar is not

altered in overall timbre.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#33:1> The midrange is exceptionally sweet and does not lose detail or

transparency.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#34:1> Many Japanese-made high-end amplifiers have excellent signal-to-noise

specifications and performance but limited midrange transparency and life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#35:1> With the RHB-10, you can really enjoy low-level midrange detail and

listen to voice without fear of hearing a change in character or of having

voice go hard or flat.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#36:1> Many transistor amplifiers are a bit unkind to female vocalists,

particularly untrained soprano voices.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#37:1> The Rotel will not compensate for vocal weaknesses, but it has the

kind of midrange that allows you to get the best out of solo voice.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#38:1> The same is true of demanding instruments like the violin and

harpsichord.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#39:1> The upper midrange and treble are equally well defined; no one

will ever accuse the RHB-10 of lacking highs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#40:1> It offers transparency and low-level definition without an apparent

brightness or edge.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#41:1> One of the most critical tests of a power amplifier is whether it

provides exceptional upper midrange detail and the ability to resolve upper

midrange harmonics, low-level detail, and transients in a way that is as

musically natural as the source material and front-end components allow.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#42:1> The upper midrange and treble of the Rotel RHB-10, though just a bit

short of reference quality, are outstanding for an amplifier in its price

range.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#43:1> The soundstage performance of the RHB-10 is equally good.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#44:1> The amp reproduces virtually all of the soundstage information on a

recording without contracting it, expanding it, or altering its apparent

location in space.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#45:1> ( I have several DAT cassettes of solo instruments that I recorded

live.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#46:1> I keep notes with these tapes on the location, apparent size, and

sound character of the guitar, drum set, and piano I recorded.)
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#47:1> The RHB-10 does an excellent job of handling image size, some very

low-level soundstage data, and left-to-right placement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#48:1> It also does very well in reproducing layers of depth with more

complicated music--although I am highly leery of saying that the depth of

orchestral or any other complicated music is ever captured naturally on a

recording and that it can ever be reproduced accurately in a home listening

room.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#49:1> The Rotel is scarcely unique in being mechanically and

electronically quiet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#50:1> In fact, I would deem unreviewable, and instantly return, any

high-end transistor power amplifier that had fan noise, mechanical hum, or

any electronic noise or hum that was audible in the listening position.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#51:1> There are so many top-quality amps without such defects that even

minimal noise is totally unacceptable!
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#52:1> The RHB-10, however, does deserve high praise for being remarkably

free of the kind of low-level noise that nags at the edges of your

perception.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#53:1> You can listen further into the music than is common with amplifiers

in its price range.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#54:1> My single reservation about the RHB-10 concerns its ergonomics

and is a bit petty.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#55:1> The WBT output terminals for speaker connections do an excellent job

of accommodating large bare wires, but they will not fit the standard spade

lugs used by many high-end speaker cable manufacturers in the U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#56:1> On the other hand, Rotel does recommend its own " 6 nines" copper

speaker cable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#57:1> This cable is not a rival of the best American cables ( such as

products from AudioQuest, OCOS, Kimber, Tara Labs, and Wireworld), but it is

of very high quality.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#58:1> If I have slightly less praise for the RHA-10 preamp, it is not

because it, too, is not an excellent- sounding unit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#59:1> Like the RHB-10, it is superbly built, uses high-quality and

custom-designed components, and has a very attractive European styling.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#60:1> This is the kind of unit that you want to display rather than hide in

a cabinet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#61:1> The RHA-10 also reflects Rotel 's emphasis on actually listening,

rather than taking sound for granted as many mid-fi designers do.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#62:1> The preamp uses a specially designed four-gang attenuator as a volume

control, Vishay resistors, high-precision switches with gold-plated contacts,

and a power supply with a very high-quality toroidal transformer.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#63:1> Circuitry is on a double-sided, high-grade glass-fiber board, with

specially formulated extra-thick copper tracks on the bottom and copper

shielding on the top.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#64:1> If the extra care taken on this circuit board design seems like

gilding the lily, let me note that every high-end electronics designer I know

has found that different types of circuit board really do have a significant

impact on the nuances of sound quality.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#65:1> The circuitry is similar to the symmetrical, push-pull topology

used in the rest of the new Rotel line.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#66:1> Rotel feels that it contributes to the preservation of subtle phase

differences between the two channels and that it presents a highly detailed

soundstage with a great deal of depth.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#67:1> Features include low-impedance outputs that allow very long

interconnects, three regular line-level inputs, and two tape loops.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#68:1> A tape buffer amplifier is intended to eliminate any possibility that

hookup to a tape unit will degrade the signal to the power amplifier, and

there is a record output switch with five positions plus a separate control

for switching the tape output off.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#69:1> All of the inputs are mechanically switched, and an input is only

connected to the ground plane when it is active.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#70:1> This feature may seem unimportant, but it is surprising how many

high-end preamps allow trace levels of signal to go from one input to

another--particularly when a tape monitor output is being fed into the

preamp.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#71:1> Two sets of RCA outputs allow for biamping or other uses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#72:1> These features are typical of today 's " minimalist" high-end

preamps, where the goal is the lest possible coloration of the signal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#73:1> At the same time, I do have three minor reservations about the

features of the RHA-10:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#74:1> * There are no balanced inputs or outputs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#75:1> This will be unimportant when the RHA-10 is used with the RHB-10 or

in an installation free of hum fields and other sources of noise.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#76:1> Most of today 's top preamps do, however, have at least one balanced

input and one balanced output.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#77:1> * It may make sense for a manufacturer to assign numbers to the

inputs on a unit intended to be exported, rather than assigning them names,

but I find names more convenient.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#78:1> * The RHA-10 does have a remote control that can also be used

with the Rotel RHT-10 turner, but the remote does not have a balance control.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#79:1> I find the ability to adjust balance via a remote control to be a

real advantage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#80:1> I have a great many CDs and records where a slight adjustment of

balance is needed to lock in left-to-right imaging and depth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#81:1> Perhaps if a balance control was called a soundstage control, its

importance might receive more widespread recognition.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#82:1> What counts most in a high-end product, however, is sound

quality, and the RHA-10 is very competitive with other preamps in its price

range.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#83:1> Its sound largely duplicates the sound of the RHB-10.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#84:1> It is very neutral in overall timbre and frequency response, with no

touch of transistor leanness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#85:1> It does not alter the highs or bass to reduce or emphasize either

frequency extreme.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#86:1> Bass extension and dynamics are fully competitive with the better

high-end U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#87:1> designs, with a high-quality deep bass that is missing in many

imported preamps.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#88:1> Percussion and string bass have excellent transient and harmonic

detail.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#89:1> The midrange is neutral and transparent, although a few U.S.-made

high-end line preamps provide slightly more low-level and transient detail.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#90:1> Reproduction of voice and solo instruments is excellent, particularly

violin, piano, and guitar.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#91:1> Resolution of complex choral passages and grand opera is very good to

excellent, and very musical.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#92:1> The upper midrange and treble are largely unaffected by the

RHA-10 preamp, with the same transparency, low-level definition, and lack of

apparent brightness or edge as the RHB-10 amp.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#93:1> The sound of the upper octaves is determined far more by the other

active and passive components in the system than by the RHA-10, although

there is a minor loss of sweetness and harmonic detail compared to the upper

octaves of the best high-end designs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#94:1> The soundstage performance of the RHA-10 is very good to

excellent--even in comparison with the top high-end units.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#95:1> Soundstage width and depth are very natural, as is the presentation

of left-to-right imaging and layers of depth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#96:1> Some other units do a slightly better job of reproducing very

low-level soundstage detail and musical dynamics, and the RHA-10 does tend to

move the apparent listening position just slightly forward.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#97:1> At the same time, the RHA-10 matches the RHB-10 in providing an

exceptional apparent signal-to-noise ratio and in being electronically

quiet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-032#98:1> In broad terms, the RHA-10 provides excellent sound quality and

highly musical performance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#99:1> It is a fact of life, however, that any line-stage preamplifier

costing over

&dollar;1,000 that does not provide excellent sound quality will simply not be

competitive in today 's market.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#100:1> The state of the art has advanced to the point where a colored or

noisy unit is more an irritating curiosity than a serious product--except for

those audiophiles who want a preamp to act as a euphonic equalizer more than

they want a neutral preamp.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#101:1> As a result, a line-stage preamp must be judged by its features and

the relatively minor sonic nuances of the kind I have just described, or it

must provide an extraordinary level of excellence at a given price point.
<ICE-USA:W2B-032#102:1> The RHA-10 is fully competitive at its price point, but it does have

competition.</p> </I>
