<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#1:1> Molecular biology has revolutionized the study of protein

structure and function.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#2:1> Not only has the microbial production of enzymes and other proteins in

useful amounts become routine in recent years, but systematic alteration of

protein sequence by site-directed mutagenesis is now a standard tool for

dissecting chemical mechanism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#3:1> The recent development of new methods for ligating peptides, however,

promises to make chemical synthesis of large proteins an attractive

alternative to biosynthesis, particularly for the construction of novel

molecules containing non-natural amino acids or other structural

modifications.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#4:1> Attempts to synthesize proteins chemically have traditionally

followed one of two basic strategies: stepwise assembly from their

constituent amino acids on a solid support, or convergent coupling of peptide

segments in solution.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#5:1> Although solid-phase peptide synthesis has been optimized to the

extent that proteins over 100 amino acids in length can be prepared in

favorable cases [ l], such syntheses still represent heroic undertakings and

the number of side products that accumulate over the many coupling steps that

are necessary often makes purification of the final product laborious.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#6:1> Convergent coupling has the considerable advantage that synthesis and

purification of peptide segments up to 30 residues long is relatively

straightforward; since a variety of unusual amino acids can be introduced

into each segment, this approach is also highly adaptable to the preparation

of multiple analogs of naturally-occurring proteins.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#7:1> But broad implementation of the fragment condensation strategy has

been limited by the poor solubility of protected peptide segments and the

tendency of a-carboxy-activated peptides to racemize.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#8:1> Many of these difficulties can be circumvented by enzymatic coupling

procedures.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#9:1> Proteolytic enzymes, particularly serine proteases, have been used

extensively in peptide synthesis because of their selectivity, ability to

function under mild reaction conditions, and minimal requirements for

protecting groups [ 2].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#10:1> Although it might seem counterintuitive to attempt to synthesize a

protein using a protease, problems due to proteolytic degradation of the

final peptide product by the catalyst can be minimized by manipulating the

reaction conditions or through genetic engineering.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#11:1> For example, replacement of the active site serine in subtilisin with

cysteine converts the protease into an acyl transferase: the modified enzyme

is readily acylated by esters and subsequently deacylated by amines, but has

greatly diminished amidase activity compared with wild-type subtilisin [ 3].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#12:1> However, substitution of sulfur for oxygen engenders steric crowding

in the active site, limiting the activity of the enzyme.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#13:1> Wells and colleagues [ 4] have relieved this crowding by mutating a

second residue in the active site.The resulting double mutant, dubbed

0subtiligase,¡ eficiently couples unprotected peptides in water.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#14:1> The acyl donor in a typical subtiligase-catalyzed ligation ( Fig.

1) is a peptide whose carboxyl terminus is esterified with a

glycolate-phenylalanine amide group.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#15:1> This ester efficiently acylates subtiligase because of the enzyme¡s

preference for glycine and phenylalanine in the two positions directly

following the 0cleavage¡ site, Pl¡ and P2¡, respectively.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#16:1> Deacylation of the enzyme by a fully deprotected peptide ( or

protein) corresponding to the desired acceptor fragment then yields the

ligated product.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#17:1> Nearly quantitative yields have been obtained for reactions between

model esters and dipeptide nucleophiles [ 4].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#18:1> Such an approach has also been successfully applied to the

post-translational modification of natural and recombinant proteins.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#19:1> For instance, biotinylated and heavy- atom derivatives of N-methionyl

human growth hormone were prepared by ligating peptides that contain biotin

or mercury to the hormone¡s N-terminus [ 5].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#20:1> Wong et al. [ 6] have used analogous enzymatic methods to synthesize

a variety of N- and Olinked glycopeptides.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#21:1> Blockwise assembly of large proteins by repeated couplings of long

peptides is also possible.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#22:1> The enzyme RNase A ( 126 amino acids) was synthesized in good yield

and high purity by subtiligase-catalyzed ligation of six peptide fragments

ranging in length from 12 to 30 residues [ 7].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#23:1> RNase A mutants containing the unnatural amino acid 4-fluorohistidine

in place of the histidines at positions 12 and 119 were also prepared to

examine whether the basic nature of these residues is important in catalysis

[ 7].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#24:1> Given that the incorporation of multiple unnatural amino acids into a

protein backbone is not currently possible using recombinant technologies,

this application of subtiligase illustrates the potential utility of chemical

approaches to protein total synthesis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#25:1> By expanding the set of possible changes that can be made, our

ability to probe structure-function relationships in proteins with the

precision of physical organic chemistry and to design new materials with

novel properties will increase dramatically.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#26:1> Site-specific incorporation of NMR probes, structural constraints,

and catalytic cofactors into proteins are only some of the exciting

possibilities that spring to mind.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#27:1> The utility of subtiligase-catalyzed peptide coupling is a

consequence, in part, of its high reaction rates and relatively broad

specificity.The glycolate esters used as acyl donors are stable and easily

prepared by solid-phase methods, so that side-reactions, especially

racemization, which are often problematic in the chemical coupling of

activated peptides are suppressed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#28:1> The fact that the enzyme tolerates a wide range of Pl, Pl¡, P2 and

P2¡ amino acids also provides great latitude in the choice of ligation site.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#29:1> Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to broaden this specificity

further [ 4,6] and to increase the stability of the enzyme [ 5,6].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#30:1> The design of subtiligase variants capable of coupling peptides in 4

M guanidine hydrochloride may be particularly important [ 5], as

highly-structured peptides and proteins are otherwise poor substrates for the

ligase.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#31:1> New non-enzymatic methods for coupling peptide fragments,

including highly structured peptides, have the potential to complement and

extend enzymatic ligation procedures considerably.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#32:1> Several research groups [ g-10] have reported powerful chemical

ligation strategies that can be carried out under fully denaturing conditions

with high efficiency.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#33:1> In these reactions, unprotected peptide fragments are specifically

brought together in such a way as to juxtapose the acyl donor and amine

acceptor.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#34:1> The high effective molarity of the reactive groups then ensures

facile intramolecular formation of the desired peptide bond.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#35:1> This approach, which bypasses the need for highly activated acyl

donors, is illustrated by the recent work of Kent and coworkers [ lo].</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#36:1> As shown in Fig. 2, native chemical ligation can be achieved by

chemoselectively reacting a peptide bearing a thioester at its carboxyl

terminus with a second peptide capped at its amino end by a cysteine.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#37:1> The resulting thioester ligation product undergoes a rapid,

geometrically favorable rearrangement involving acyl transfer from the thiol

to the amine, yielding a final product that contains a native amide bond at

the ligation site.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#38:1> Both peptide segments are conveniently prepared by conventional

techniques, and coupling is rapid and selective in aqueous buffer, occurring

without significant side reactions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#39:1> In fact, solubilizing agents such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride

appear to enhance the chemical efficiency of reaction by concentrating and

denaturing the peptide segments.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#40:1> The synthesis of interleukin- 8, a 72-residue cytokine that contains

multiple disulfide bonds, demonstrates the utility of this approach for the

preparation of moderately-sized polypeptides [ lo]; the synthesis of larger

proteins and protein analogs is limited only by the availability of larger,

appropriately modified peptide segments.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#41:1> Although native chemical ligation strategies require a cysteine at

the coupling site, this is not likely to be a significant limitation in the

preparation of proteins with novel architectures.The thiol side chain is a

useful catalytic group and/or metal ligand in many proteins.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#42:1> It is also readily converted through selective alkylation to a

variety of anionic, cationic and neutral functionalities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#43:1> Indeed, the high yields and comparatively easy implementation of the

chemical approach are likely to render it an effective alternative to

enzymatic coupling methods in many instances, and a successful marriage of

the two techniques may dramatically increase the size range of polypeptides

directly accessible by total chemical synthesis.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#44:1> Of course, chemists wishing to synthesize proteins need not be

bound by nature¡s choices.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#45:1> In addition to expanding the repertoire of amino acid side chains

that can be incorporated into proteins, chemical synthesis makes backbone

engineering possible: peptide segments and protein domains can be joined by

linkages other than the amide bond.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#46:1> This point is illustrated by variants of HIV- l protease containing

novel thiol ester linkages [ 11,12], which were constructed by combining a

peptide fragment possessing a C-terminal thioester with a second segment

bearing a bromoacetyl group at its amino end.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#47:1> Alkylation of the thiol occurs rapidly and in high yield.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#48:1> When the thioester replaces the natural peptide bond between Gly51

and Gly52, the alkylated product remains fully active [ l 11, but when it is

used to replace the Gly49-Ile50 peptide bond, catalytic activity is reduced [

12].
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#49:1> This observation provided direct evidence for the notion that

specific backbone hydrogen bonds from the enzyme active site flaps to the

substrate are important for the catalytic function of the protease.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#50:1> Backbone engineering has also been exploited for the rapid assembly

of a four-helix bundle on a ternplating peptide [ 13] and for semisynthesis

of analogs of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor containing a single

backbone acyl hydrazone bond [ 14]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#51:1> In sum, versatile new methods for coupling peptides provide the

basis for a general and modular approach to the chemical synthesis of large

proteins.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#52:1> Accordingly, the field of protein chemistry is likely to experience

something of a renaissance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#53:1> For decades to come, wide implementation of these technologies will

provide exciting research opportunities for chemists and biologists

interested in exploring protein structure and function.</p> </I>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#54:2> The chlorobenzene emissions detected in the stack effluent of

this facility probably resulted from a combination of two processes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#55:2> The first is the original contamination found in the sludge feed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#56:2> Previous studies have shown chlorobenzene to be a very stable

compound, even when decompoSed as part of a mixture ( 17,18)-.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#57:2> Thus, the appearance of chlorobenzene in the stack is probably due in

part to its ability to undergo relatively harsh thermal exposures and escape

unscathed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#58:2> The second contribution to the emission of chlorobenzene at the

full-scale facility is the possibility that this compound was formed as a

PIC.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#59:2> We have conducted many studies involving the decomposition of benzene

and/or toluene or related compounds in the presence of chlorinated species.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#60:2> The free chlorine radicals generated in such a reaction atmosphere

have host of chlorine- containing compounds were detected in the sludge feed

at the full- scale facility, it is logical that chlorobenzene was detected in

the stack.</p> </I>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#61:3> Food items in stomachs were identified to the lowest practical

taxon and counted under a dissecting microscope.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#62:3> The individual prey items were blotted dry and weighed to the nearest

milligram.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#63:3> Typically, crustaceans were identified to genus or family and insects

to family or order.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#64:3> Fish were identified to species or genus and measured ( fork length)

to the nearest millimeter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#65:3> Partly digested fishes often were identified by their bone

morphology, as determined from a reference collection ( Hansel et al. 1988)

when length could not be measured directly because of digestion, we estimated

it from standard or nape-to-tail lengths or bone lengths ( Hansel et al.

1988) with regression equations developed from whole specimens.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#66:3> Partly digested fish remains from more than one prey fish species

were weighed together and apportioned to each species on the basis of the

extrapolated sizes of whole fish.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#67:3> When we could not estimate the relative sizes of each prey fish, we

divided the total weight of the parts equally among fish in the stomach.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#68:3> Parasites, non-food items, and unidentified materials were ignored in

dietary calculations.</p> <&> [ TABLE 2 OMITTED]</&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-029#69:3> To determine if northern squawfish were feeding selectively on

certain sizes of juvenile salmonids, we compared the length frequencies of

juvenile salmonids in the digestive tracts of northern squawfish to length

frequencies of those available in the environment during the same days

predators were collected near the dam.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#70:3> Length data on salmonids from the environment were obtained from

smolt samples at the McNary Dam collection facility ( Paul Wagner, Washington

Department of Fisheries, unpublished data); these data were continuous but

grouped, because smolts were sorted into groups by 10-mm increments and

individual measurements were not available.
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#71:3> The length-frequency distributions were tested for independence with

the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test for continuous, group data ( Zar

1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-029#72:3> Lengths of juvenile salmonids were pooled for all years by month

because length distributions did not vary significantly among years.</p> </I>
