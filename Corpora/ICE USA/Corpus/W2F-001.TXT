<ICE-USA:W2F-001#1:1> <h> THE DOGS OF CARRBORO </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-001#2:1> Looking at the freshly painted white wall of her apartment, she

wonders what it would be like just to leave the few remaining cardboard boxes

on the floor and never finish unpacking.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#3:1> That way she could savor the newness of her new life, the excitement

of not quite remembering what 's around the corner.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#4:1> She pushes a plastic fork through the salad she got at the deli she

discovered today.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#5:1> An elegant salad, a seductive salad of avocado, crumbled feta, red

pepper, black olives.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#6:1> She holds an olive on her tongue for a long second before swallowing

it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#7:1> Yes, she loves the place, she loves Berkeley, the job at the agency

has started well.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#8:1> At the moment she knows with mathematical certitude that she 's made

the right choice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#9:1> And that 's even without taking into account the view from the balcony:

over spikes of bottlebrush to a discreet blue wedge of the bay.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#10:1> She 's saving that for now, not the salad and the view at the same

time, not yet.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#11:1> Who needs any more than this?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#12:1> The phone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#13:1> Which is a surprise.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#14:1> His voice, which she hasn't heard in months.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#15:1> She feels herself stiffening, looks toward the door as if to assure

herself that it 's locked, and sees her yellow jacket hanging on the knob.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#16:1> " How did you get my number?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#17:1> She 's conscious of holding the receiver a half-inch further away than

usual.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#18:1> " I've got my sources," he says airily.
<ICE-USA:W2F 've1#19:1> For a while she doesn't answer but maintains what she thinks is a

chilly silence.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#20:1> It 's part instinct and part conscious signal.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#21:1> Still, she has to admire his resourcefulness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#22:1> Of course, he was always resourceful, and with the way he lived, he

had to be.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#23:1> That 's all in the past, she reminds herself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#24:1> It makes him less of a threat and she feels better.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#25:1> After all, he 's across the continent in Virginia.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#26:1> " So how 's it going out there"" he asks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#27:1> " Terrific.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#28:1> Couldn't be better," it 's like a strong forehand whacked smartly

across the net.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#29:1> Only maybe it 's a little too strong.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#30:1> It sounds overdone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#31:1> Maybe she should have toned it down just a little. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-001#32:1> For a while there 's a silence and she remembers his tall

silhouette, the long topcoat, wide shoulders.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#33:1> Just when she 's beginning to wonder if he 's still there she hears him

again: " Tell me what you're seeing."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#34:1> 're laughs to herself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#35:1> One of his little photographer 's games.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#36:1> Strangely, though, she doesn't mind acquiescing: it 's like the old

times without being the old times.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#37:1> " I see a room," she says.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#38:1> " White walls, a sliding glass door leading to a balcony.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#39:1> The curtains are white too, there 's a green wall-to-wall carpet--

avocado.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#40:1> There are a few boxes on the floor."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#41:1> She talks slowly, expecting him to break in at any moment with a

clicking sound like a man snapping a picture but all he says is " Yeah," as

if he 's suddenly lost interest, and she stops describing the apartment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#42:1> It 's different out here, she wants to tell him, the air is sharp and

dry, not like the South.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#43:1> Here when you step into the shade the heat doesn't follow you.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#44:1> But all at once she feels disoriented: for the moment she 's been

pulled back into his world, or rather, he 's re-interpreted hers, framing it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#45:1> Something has gone out of her elation, like a wind dying down.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#46:1> " I'm going to get wind-chimes," she 'mys, apropos of nothing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#47:1> " There 's always a breeze in the evening."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#48:1> He doesn't respond.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#49:1> " Hey," she asks, " are you still there?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#50:1> " Yeah."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#51:1> The slow Carolina drawl makes the word seem longer than it is and

hearing it she sees again that thin face with two distinctly different

halves, remembers the blond hair and green eyes that change color like the

sea.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#52:1> She tries to gauge from the sound how much his life is under control

now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#53:1> " How are you doing?" she asks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#54:1> " Good.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#55:1> Real good.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#56:1> I got a teaching gig for the fall.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#57:1> At the community college."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#58:1> " That 's great."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#59:1> Maybe he does have it together, after all, though with him the

question is always: for how long?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#60:1> " You meet any nice new people out there?" he asks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#61:1> " Uh-huh." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-001#62:1> There 's no need to tell him that she isn't interested in new

people right now, she just wants to start life clean, a tabula rasa, like

this apartment; and she wishes she could keep it that way for a while:

innocence, learning something new each day about the city, like the names of

TV anchorpeople, the best places for Mexican food ( she can hear him on that

subject).
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#63:1> She 's done her duty, paid her dues, her life with him is over.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#64:1> " Think of it as four years in the Peace Corps," a friend in Chicago

said, " working in an undeveloped nation."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#65:1> " Isn't the current term developing nations?" she asked, going along

with the joke; but the friend answered, " No, with this one there 's no

possibility-- we're not talking Third Wor 'rehere, more like Seventh or

Eighth.?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#66:1> They laughed, drank wine.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#67:1> There were wildflowers on the bright orange tablecloth, the big lake

heaved softly on the horizon-- everything seemed to float.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#68:1> It felt so good to be able to talk about all that from a distance, no

longer tied up in it, in the pain, in his mood swings, the sudden onset of

long silences, vodka before noon, suicidal glooms.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#69:1> " Developing nations."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#70:1> Only later did she recognize the photographic pun.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#71:1> Now she looks around the empty white room: her canary yellow jacket

slumps over the doorknob, her discarded shoes a few feet from the door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#72:1> Home.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#73:1> She feels like the heroine at the end of a horror movie: after the

dark corridors, the ominous sounds at the bottom of the stairs, mysterious

shapes; after her own panting, heart pounding in her throat, she 's safe at

last, in her favorite chair, and the thud she hears in the distance is only

the plop of the folded newspaper on the porch.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#74:1> " I want a normal life," she says.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#75:1> " And I've got one now."
<ICE-US 've2F-001#76:1> " Heh-heh," he cackles stagily, as if reading her thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#77:1> Aren't you just a little nostalgic, the laugh seems to ask, for those

terrors"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#78:1> " How can you be sure I can't reach you even in that white apartment

with the green rug and the sliding glass door?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#79:1> You know, if you think bad thoughts about me you'll get cold sores." 'llICE-USA:W2F-001#80:1> Relieved that he 's joking, she answers, " I don't .
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#81:1> .
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#82:1> . </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-001#83:1> " She wants to say she doesn't think any thoughts of him at all

but that wouldn't be true.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#84:1> " I don't want cold sores," she says.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#85:1> " How vain you are, my dear," comes the voice from across the

country.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#86:1> " Isn't that a little like the pot calling the kettle black?" she

says, remembering his swaggering dramatic poses, the costumes, his staged

entrances.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#87:1> But she loved it once, didn't she, their bohemian life, when she

thought of herself as a serious painter?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#88:1> On one of their anniversaries they colored each other 's faces: savage

streaks of yellow under one of his eyes, a peaceful blue under the other; he

put a tiny rainbow on her brow.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#89:1> " Every time you get a cold sore you'll think of me," 'llsays.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#90:1> " Aren't you sweet?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#91:1> " Hey, sweetie, I don't use my magic powers on just anyone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#92:1> You should feel flattered."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#93:1> Can they really be talking like this, in a harmless enough way?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#94:1> Last spring on that hot whispery street in Virginia her throat burned

as if she'd swallowed l 'd, the scent of honeysuckle and mimosa pressing down

on her through the humid air while he stood a few feet away, holding the hand

he'd hurt when h 'dpunched a tree.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#95:1> Now here they are at different ends of the country, bantering

lightly, a regular stir fry of a conversation.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#96:1> She smiles, looking at the salad 's bright colors before her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#97:1> Is it possible that a call from him can be just a parenthesis,

pleasant, funny, nostalgic, in her life?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#98:1> Still, she doesn't quite trust the feeling.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#99:1> Looking at the sunlight on her white walls in California she feels

protected from that other side of him, hungry and demanding.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#100:1> She remembers a night in Carolina when he looked at her across a

table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#101:1> It was in a roadhouse on Route 29, heavy with tobacco smoke.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#102:1> As the band played something slow and melancholy he sat there,

hunched over for the longest time, silent as a stone, until he suddenly drew

himself erect.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#103:1> All the features on his pale face were the same but he'd become a
 'dstranger.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#104:1> " I do not understand the person I am," he declared with great

formality his eyes looking beyond her, beyond the fake log cabin walls of the

roadhouse.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#105:1> It scared her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#106:1> Silently she assented: he wasn't the man she thought she knew, that

was clear, that had been becoming clearer all the time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#107:1> Days later they acted as though none of it had ever happened, as if

it were a matter of washing the paint from their faces; but that night in the

roadhouse was the first time she admitted to herself they weren't likely to

stay together.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#108:1> Sometimes his pictures could achieve the same kind of readjustment

of vision: a familiar object suddenly became mysterious, menacing; an

ordinary scene was transformed into a magical revelation.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#109:1> It was uncanny how he'd caught som 'dhing in their homely doorway in

Chapel Hill: the tall, thin shape-- like him, in a way-- the frame not quite

in line, the peeling paint and that worn, once elegant knob.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#110:1> His camera turned it into an ambiguous omen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#111:1> Remembering that doorway to their apartment in Chapel Hill she 's

suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of loss.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#112:1> Yes, if you looked at it the right way you could glimpse things that

hadn't yet gone on behind that door, you could believe that doorway could

somehow foretell her being alone here in California.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#113:1> Life opens up, her friend in Chicago told her, tomorrow can always

be better than today.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#114:1> There are times, though, when she believes that all there is is

memory.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#115:1> 'Hey, sweetie," his voice breaks in on her thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#116:1> " I was thinking-" - - " Yeah?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#117:1> " In a couple of years we're both going 're be middle-aged."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#118:1> She says nothing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#119:1> " Isn't that weird, though?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#120:1> He sounds genuinely bemused.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#121:1> It 's not an idea she finds particularly appealing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#122:1> " Well," she says, " you'll be ther 'llirst."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#123:1> It 's their joke, since he 's three weeks older than she is.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#124:1> " I'll tell 'll how it feels." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-001#125:1> They're both 'reent for a while trying to fathom how it will

feel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#126:1> It 's a step forward, she told herself this morning, giving up those

ideas about painting-- it 's seeing things clearly, and that feels good.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#127:1> Her job at the agency is challenging, her work helps people, at the

end of the day she feels satisfied, she 's contributed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#128:1> " I was down at the coast last week," he says.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#129:1> " I remembered that bird we saw."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#130:1> " What bird?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#131:1> " The one in the marsh that day with its wings up."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#132:1> " Oh.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#133:1> Yeah."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#134:1> The memory comes distantly, as though she 's watching someone else 's

home video.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#135:1> It was a quiet place with soft contours, where the marsh grass bent

under its own weight, green willows drooped beside a sluggish tidal stream.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#136:1> She was the first to notice the black shape a hundred yards away, on

a piling in the water near a weatherbeaten dock.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#137:1> It was a large seabird that was facing them, its wings extended,

like an eagle on a coin, but it was so motionless that at first she thought

it had to be sculpture or a carving.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#138:1> For a long time it remained perfectly still and then a wing moved

slightly, like a guarded gesture of welcome, just enough to indicate that

this was a living creature.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#139:1> But it didn't move any further, it just stayed there, frozen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#140:1> " Look at that," he said, taking her hand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#141:1> " That means something, doesn't it?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#142:1> It 's got to mean something."
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#143:1> The two of them stood there a long time, contemplating this world of

grass and water that was breathing slowly with the tide while one creature

stayed mysteriously still.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#144:1> " Yeah," she says again, realizing by the time she 's remembered it

fully that she 's moved by the wonder of that moment, no longer distant.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#145:1> " So strange," she says, looking at the white walls of her

apartment, her jacket hanging on the door, the discarded shoes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#146:1> After a while he asks, " Don't you get lonely sometimes?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#147:1> " No,"- she answers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#148:1> An absurd response but she 's leaving him no opening.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#149:1> " Oh, I do," he says matter-of-factly and it seems as though he has

no intention of pushing the subject any further. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-001#150:1> But how can you know about him, how can you ever know?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#151:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-001#152:1> He always had something up his sleeve.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#153:1> That last year in Virginia she went through the days clenched, ready

for the explosions that were sure to come.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#154:1> Yet even then there were times like the night he drove her with

great mystery across the back roads to a bridge over the railroad tracks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#155:1> The sky above them was black and starless, dark heat moved through

the hissing leaves and tree frogs shrieked.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#156:1> Under the smell of ripe vegetation there was a faint trace of oil

coming up from the tracks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#157:1> What was he doing, she wondered, why had he dragged her out here?
<ICE-USA:W2F-001#158:1> </I>
