<I>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#1:1> <h> A milestone for the Mideast</h> For too long it was fashionable to

say, as if history were destiny, that the Middle East could never be

hospitable to peaceful compromise.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#2:1> Not the least of the achievements wrought in the disengagement

agreement between the Israeli government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and

Yasser Arafat 's PLO is their common transcendence of old habits.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#3:1> The 460-page accord that Rabin and Arafat will sign Thursday at the

White House has more in common with a commercial contract than it does with

the circular logic of a permanent vendetta.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#4:1> If this contract is implemented, a century of nationalist passion

and communal vengefulness will culminate in an imperfect but practical

resolution of a desolating conflict.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#5:1> The Palestinians will still be subject to the indignities of

occupation.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#6:1> Particularly in the city of Hebron, where a cluster of 450 ideological

Israeli settlers will continue to be protected by Israeli troops, the symbols

of Israeli rule will linger on for a while.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#7:1> But the political itinerary of the two peoples has been made

explicit.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#8:1> Explaining to Israeli voters in the most palatable terms possible the

destination of his statecraft, Rabin said: " I think we made the right step

in the direction of our final goal, which is not Greater Israel as a

binational state but the state of Israel as a Jewish state.?
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#9:1> The separation of the two communities, as stipulated in the legalistic

document concluded Sunday, will be administrative, territorial and political.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#10:1> Henceforth Arafat will cease to be merely the appointed boss of Gaza

and Jericho.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#11:1> The other cities of the West Bank and 450 Palestinian towns and

villages will be transferred from Israeli to Palestinian control, and Arafat

will be elected president of a national council whose 82 members are to be

elected 22 days after Israeli troops withdraw from Palestinian areas.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#12:1> <h> Run, Colin, run</h> If Gen. Colin Powell sticks to his military

dictum that battles shouldn't be joined without overwhelmingly superior force

and a virtual assurance of victory, then he will not enter the presidential

race this fall.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#13:1> But if he is guided by another one of his maxims - that campaigns

require the clear support of the American people - then he should run.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#14:1> There is no denying the excitement that a possible Powell

candidacy has generated.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#15:1> In television and radio interviews the general exudes a quiet

confidence and common-sense approach to politics that appeal to the broad

center increasingly turned off by both political parties.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#16:1> Gradually, as his positions emerge, Powell is coming across as

more fiscally conservative than the Democrats and more socially liberal than

most of the Republicans.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#17:1> This might argue for a run as an independent.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#18:1> But as Powell himself has said, independent candidates don't win

presidential elections.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#19:1> He said he was reluctant to play the spoiler and " throw the election

up in the air.?
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#20:1> Therefore we would urge Powell to enter the race as a Republican.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#21:1> True, he may be a tad liberal for some hard-core GOP primary voters.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#22:1> But the field lacks luster, and of the 52 primaries and caucuses next

year, the 34 that allow independents and Democrats to cross over account for

1,213 out of the 1,984 GOP delegates to be chosen.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#23:1> Disappointed Perot supporters who are looking for a fresh but less

eccentric personality might well turn to the general.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#24:1> Were a Powell candidacy to push the GOP toward moderation, so much

the better.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#25:1> Political parties are not that difficult to capture, as Barry

Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, George McGovern and even Bill Clinton have

proved.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#26:1> Race is never far below the surface in American life, and it is

difficult to predict its effect were Powell to run.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#27:1> But race is not what is driving a Powell candidacy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#28:1> What people sense in Powell is leadership.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#29:1> Many questions about Powell remain to be answered.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#30:1> But let him immerse himself in the acid bath of presidential politics

and the quality of his mettle will emerge.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#31:1> <h> National disservice</h> National service was one of Bill

Clinton 's most appealing themes as a candidate, and it was one of the prime

legislative successes of his first year in the White House.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#32:1> Now Republicans are trying to snuff the life out of AmeriCorps,

the national service program that has been operating, and thriving, for just

over a year.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#33:1> Senators face a choice this week of whether to kill it, as their

Appropriations Committee and the House have already voted, or continue it at

its current level.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#34:1> Eliminating national service would definitely be bad policy; it would

quite likely also be a political boomerang.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#35:1> AmeriCorps is popular in all sections of the country, generating

support from 90 percent of those familiar with it, according to a Gallup

survey, and for good reason.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#36:1> It now has more than 20,000 members contributing to their communities

tangibly: cleaning up streets, parks and streams; assisting teachers in

schools; helping build housing; encouraging neighborhood crime-fighting

efforts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#37:1> For this, members get a modest stipend and

&dollar; 4,725 to spend on college or vocational education.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#38:1> An offshoot - Learn and Serve AmeriCorps - helps stimulate part-time

community service from some 750,000 young people who are still in school.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#39:1> The overall federal cost of

&dollar; 400 million - less than

&dollar; 20,000 a person - leverages more than

&dollar; 200 million in state and private funding.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#40:1> Most important, it invests in neighborhoods and individuals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#41:1> There are only two rational reasons for members of Congress to

oppose AmeriCorps.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#42:1> One is the genuine belief of minimalists that government should do

nothing more than is absolutely necessary.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#43:1> But even conservative governors like William Weld, John Engler of

Michigan and Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire are enthusiastic about national

service generally and specifically about AmeriCorps, which focuses on local

projects.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#44:1> The other reason is to deny Clinton what has become his signature

program.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#45:1> If Congress is willing to dump AmeriCorps out of pure politics, the

cynicism implicit in this rationale, along with the actual damage, will not

escape the voters.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#46:1> <h> Avoiding FAA crashes</h> BODY: The disquieting frequency of

failures recently in America 's air traffic control network highlights the

need for fundamental changes in the Federal Aviation Administration.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#47:1> The FAA as presently constituted has proven unable to effect the

major upgrades in technology needed to protect the safety of pilots, crew and

passengers in US airspace.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#48:1> It would not be going too far to say that the air traffic control

infrastructure is crumbling.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#49:1> Radar screens are going blank and radios are going dead across the

country.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#50:1> At the Aurora, Ill., nerve center that guides airplanes over six

Midwestern states, the main system has gone down five times since May.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#51:1> Last week a power failure took out the radar at Pittsburgh

International Airport, while a similar outage in Northern California last

month disabled not only the primary computer but also its backup.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#52:1> The foremost reason is age.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#53:1> Some of the devices that guide 1.5 million people across our skies

each day still use vacuum tubes instead of transistors.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#54:1> The main computer at Aurora is 25 years old.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#55:1> Modernization has been hampered by byzantine procurement regulations

on the one hand and an average two-year tenure for politically appointed FAA

chiefs on the other.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#56:1> Reform is badly needed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#57:1> Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Rep. John Duncan of Tennessee

have introduced competing bills to achieve it.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#58:1> The Duncan bill would remove the FAA from the Department of

Transportation and make it an independent agency headed by an executive

appointed by a five-member board.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#59:1> Making the administrator independent yet accountable is an excellent

idea; the McCain bill would leave the FAA under the Department of

Transportation 's umbrella.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#60:1> Duncan 's plan to remove the aviation trust fund from the budget would

free up some cash for operating expenses at first, but if that language

prevails in conference committee, safeguards should be added to make sure the

bulk of the fund remains intact so the agency has enough money for new

equipment in the future.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#61:1> <h> Slander on the Net;</h> There is no doubt that computer networks

are creating new modes of communication, but it is becoming equally obvious

that they are also clearing the way for a new permutation on an old American

tradition: the wasteful and ill-conceived legal action.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#62:1> The perpetrators are small-time companies engaged in quixotic

lawsuits for electronic libel.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#63:1> Last week the Carib Inn in the Antilles filed suit against

America Online to release the true identity of one its users - known by the

handle Jenny TRR - so the resort can sue " Jenny" for libel.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#64:1> Her offense?
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#65:1> Posting a message in AOL 's SCUBA area relating an alleged experience

with a stoned diving instructor at the inn.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#66:1> The inn 's owners seem to be taking a cue from the misguided

directors of the Stratton-Oakmont investment bank, which is suing Prodigy for

allowing an unknown user to post an allegedly defamatory comment on one of

its boards.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#67:1> The bank wants

&dollar; 200 million in damages.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#68:1> Ironically, the door to holding Prodigy liable as a publisher was

opened by the company 's attempts to screen obscene and otherwise

objectionable messages.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#69:1> Can anyone imagine besmirched customers trying to hold tavern

owners liable for anonymous bathroom wall graffitti, or insisting they hunt

down the authors?
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#70:1> Of course not.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#71:1> Judges need to refine the law to protect on-line providers from

liability for the sharp typing fingers of their users.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#72:1> <h> Slender on the Net</h> Some of the Republican presidential

hopefuls got a publicity boost when they unveiled their sites on the

Internet 's World Wide Web, and for good reason.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#73:1> A presence on the web could generate new interactions between

candidates and the public.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#74:1> But that promise has gone largely unfulfilled.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#75:1> A survey of campaign sites reveals a lot of stale press releases and

150-word issue summaries but no sense of real communication - certainly none

of the healthy two-way dialogue found on sites like the one run by New

Hampshire 's second-largest newspaper, Foster 's Daily Democrat - or even any

humor like that embodied by the tongue-in-cheek Hispanics for Wilson page.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#76:1> Instead, the GOP candidates' Internet presence seems to have little

purpose other than impressing the media.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#77:1> We are not impressed.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#78:1> Bob Dole, who does not have an official site, now has an opportunity

to show up his rivals and do something to trim his dowdy image.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#79:1> <h> A hazardous proposal</h> A Congress that is flirting with an Oct.

1 government shutdown because of its budget disputes with President Clinton

faces a less prominent but equally important deadline Dec. 31, by which time

it must act to preserve the funding mechanism for cleaning up hazardous waste

sites.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#80:1> If Congress fails to renew special levies on the petroleum and

chemical industries, which yield

&dollar; 1.5 billion annually, money for the cleanup of hazardous wastes will dry

up.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#81:1> The Superfund system, established in 1980 to help manage and pay

for hazardous-waste cleanup, has never satisfied everyone.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#82:1> The slow pace of the cleanups, the mounting number of identified

sites, the arbitrariness of some cleanup rules and the potential for large

fines despite minimal involvement have produced demands for revisions.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#83:1> The risks of acquiring possibly contaminated sites, moreover, has led

to a preference for virgin land for industrial development - a considerable

disadvantage for old regions, especially cities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#84:1> Despite these misgivings, Congress has extended the 1980 act

several times.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#85:1> It now appears willing to let the special taxes and fees expire at

the end of the year.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#86:1> That would be a mistake, because future federal funding of toxic

waste cleanup would then have to come from general revenues and compete with

funding for other programs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#87:1> Indeed, the petroleum and chemical industries want extension of

the special taxes, and they advocate earmarking Superfund money so it won't

be siphoned off into the general fund for deficit reduction.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#88:1> This has led to underspending by the fund and the accumulation of a

surplus of

&dollar; 4 billion.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#89:1> There are 93 Superfund sites in New England.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#90:1> Eliminating the dedicated tax-and-fee structure will complicate

rather than simplify the process in an area that needs all the help it can

get.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#91:1> <h> Secrets of the stars</h> Cosmologists have long sought evidence

on the age of the universe as well as the ages of its stars and galaxies and

have developed through theory and observation some confidence in their

judgment about each.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#92:1> However, they have recently been discovering stars that appear to be

significantly older than the roughly 10 billion years they have believed is

the age of the universe.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-007#93:1> There is widespread, though not total, agreement among scientists

that the universe as we now recognize it began in the Big Bang.
<ICE-USA:W2E-007#94:1> An unimaginable detonation unleashed all matter, transforming it from

near-nothing through a fantastically rapid process into shapes that evolved

into stars and galaxies.</p> </I>
