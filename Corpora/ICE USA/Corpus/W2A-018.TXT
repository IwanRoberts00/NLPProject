<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#2:1> Educational efforts and innovative policies have reduced the

prevalence of cigarette smoking among US adults from 41.7&percent; in 1965' to 28.8&percent;

in 1987.2
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#3:1> Despite this progress, 15.7&percent; of deaths in 1984 could still be

attributed to smoking.3
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#4:1> African Americans suffer from a particularly severe burden of

smoking-related disease.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#5:1> The age-adjusted smoking-attributable mortality rate among African

Americans in 1984 was 143.2 per 100 000 persons compared with 119.0 among

Whites.3
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#6:1> The 1987 National Health Interview Survey found that 32.9&percent; of

African-American adults smoked compared with 28.5&percent; of White adults; the

proportion of ever smokers who had quit was far lower among African Americans

( 31.0&percent; vs 45.8&percent;).2 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#7:1> Much attention has therefore been directed to reducing the

prevalence of smoking among African Americans.4,5
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#8:1> Identification of factors that promote smoking in the African-American

community is a prerequisite to developing effective interventions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#9:1> Evidence from the 1987 General Social Survey suggests that stress may

be such a factor.6 </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#10:1> <h> <it> Stress and Smoking </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#11:1> Psychological stress can be defined as an " internal subjective

state involving the perception of threat to one 's well-being," while

stressors are stimuli that provoke psychological stress in susceptible

individuals.7
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#12:1> Stressors have been shown to increase tobacco consumption among

established smokers,8 promote adolescent cigarette use,9 predispose to

smoking clinic failure,10 and precipitate relapses among successful

quitters.",11,12
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#13:1> Investigators have evaluated a variety of potential stressors,

including anxiety-inducing tasks,8 family turmoil,9 job factors,13 and major

life events ( e.g., unemployment, divorce).6,10 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#14:1> Lazarus and colleagues have recently argued that daily hassles

may represent a better conceptualization of stress than traditional measures

of major life events.14
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#15:1> They define hassles as " the initiating, frustrating, distressing

demands that to some degree characterize everyday transactions with the

environment."15
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#16:1> Hassles appear to predict many health outcomes, including

psychological distress,15 somatic symptoms,16 respiratory illness episodes,17

and arthritis-related disability.18 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#17:1> In a 12-month follow-up study of ex-smokers who had participated

in a smoking cessation program, the frequency and severity of hassles were

significant predictors of late relapse in men, but not in women.19
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#18:1> A similar evaluation of a work-site smoking cessation program found

that the mean severity of hassles, but not the count, predicted relapse by 12

months.20
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#19:1> Previous studies have not addressed the relationship between hassles

and the prevalence of smoking in a community sample.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#20:1> Given the role of smoking as a psychological coping behavior,7 we

hypothesized that persons reporting numerous hassles would be more likely to

smoke than those experiencing fewer stressors. </p> <&> GRAPH, TABLE, FIGURE,

ETC removed</&>
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#21:1> <h> <it> Social Support and Smoking </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#22:1> There is extensive epidemiologic evidence of a relationship

between social support and diverse health outcomes.21
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#23:1> Persons with high levels of social support have lower mortality

rates,22 have less coronary atherosclerosis, and use less health care24 than

those with lower levels of support.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#24:1> Social support may exert these salutary effects partially by

fostering changes in health-related behaviors, such as smoking.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#25:1> Indeed, successful quitters have higher levels of perceived support

from their partners than smokers who never quit or relapse.25
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#26:1> Having someone to talk to about one 's problems predicted cessation in

another recent study.26
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#27:1> The prevalence of smoking is higher among separated or divorced

persons than among those currently married or widowed,2 even after

controlling for other demographic characteristics.27
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#28:1> We therefore hypothesized that persons with poor social support would

be more likely to smoke than those with good support. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#29:1> <h> <it> Buffering and the Stress-Support Interaction </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#30:1> The mechanism by which social support improves health outcomes

has been a subject of intense debate.28
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#31:1> Advocates of the buffering hypothesis argue that social support works

by moderating the deleterious effect of stressful events and serving as "

coping assistance."29
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#32:1> Therefore, our final hypothesis was that any association between

social support and smoking would be stronger among persons experiencing

stressors than among those in low-stressor environments. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#33:1> The present study was undertaken to assess the cross-sectional

relationship between these social factors and smoking behavior in a large

population-based sample of African-American adults in the San Francisco Bay

area. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#34:1> <h> <bold> <it> Methods </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#35:1> As part of a prospective controlled community intervention trial

to reduce cancer mortality, a survey of African-American households in San

Francisco and Oakland, Calif., was conducted between November 1985 and July

1986.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#36:1> Potential respondents were identified through two-stage probability

sampling.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#37:1> In the first stage, 100 census blocks with at least 25&percent; African-

American population according to the 1980 census) were randomly selected from

each city.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#38:1> Specific households were then randomly selected from each block.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#39:1> Using the Kish procedure, interviewers randomly identified one

respondent from each household with an African-American member aged 20 years

or over.30
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#40:1> A non-profit survey research organization hired, trained, and

supervised field workers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#41:1> Intensive efforts were made to interview persons who were not

available during the initial visit.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#42:1> Follow-up telephone contacts with at least 10&percent; of all respondents

confirmed that the interviews took place and that the information obtained

was accurate. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#43:1> The survey instrument included questions about current health

status, health behaviors, use of preventive services, sources of health

information, knowledge and attitudes regarding cancer, social networks and

stressors, and demographic characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#44:1> Smokers were defined in the usual manner2 as individuals who

currently smoked and had smoked at least 100 cigarettes since birth.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#45:1> Average daily consumption of 20 or more cigarettes was used as the

cutoff to separate heavy smokers from light smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#46:1> Demographic variables included age, gender, years of formal

education, household income ( recoded from an ordinal into a continuous

variable), marital status, and employment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#47:1> Respondents were asked to describe the impact of smoking on cancer

risk ( 1 through 7 scale); those who indicated that it had no effect, a

favorable effect, or an unknown effect were categorized as " unaware." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#48:1> A four-item, health-specific locus of control scale was adapted

from the work of Wallston et al.31
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#49:1> This scale represents the mean of standardized Likert-type responses

( coded 1 through 6) to four statements concerning self- control over health.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#50:1> A high score represents a strong belief in one 's ability to avoid

getting sick by taking care of oneself, to stay healthy by following " the

advice of experts," and to control " the most important things that affect

health." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#51:1> A 10-item hassles index was created by abbreviating the original

Kanner et al. list of 117 hassles.l5
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#52:1> Each item was chosen to represent a dimension that community

residents involved in the project perceived to be especially relevant ( Table

1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#53:1> The second item ( " having a serious illness or accident")was deleted

from the scale because of concern that such events might be consequences

rather than causes of smoking.32
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#54:1> Scoring from zero to nine was based upon how many of the remaining

hassles happened to the respondent or a person " most important" to him or

her during the preceding three months.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#55:1> We did not employ an intensity scale because the frequency of hassles

has superior predictive power.l5-l7
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#56:1> In accord with Dohrenwend 's recommendations,32 we inquired whether

these events occurred but did not ask for any judgment as to their

significance. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#57:1> The original Kanner et al. Instrument was reportedl7 to have a

test- retest reliability of r = 0.79 with nine consecutive monthly

administrations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#58:1> Similar instruments developed by Weinberger et al.,18 Wolf et al.,33

and DeLongis et al.34 have demonstrated 5- through 9-month median test-retest

reliabilities of .72 to .77.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#59:1> Our abbreviated instrument had good internal consistency ( Cronbach 's

( = .74) We validated the scale against demographic variables; the mean score

was 2.S for employed and 4.1 for unemployed respondents.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#60:1> Hassle scores were inversely related to family income ( r = - .19, P

= .0001). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#61:1> Measures of social network characteristics can be categorized as

either structural or functional.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#62:1> Structural features were assessed using Berkman and Syme 's Social

Network Index ( SNI),22 which measures four types of social ties: marital

status, number of close friends, number of close relatives, and membership in

formal groups.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#63:1> This index was modified slightly by adding two types of specified

organizations ( neighborhood and senior groups) and dropping a question on

the frequency of contact with close friends or relatives.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#64:1> Scores range from one to four, where one represents those with the

fewest relatives or friends and no history of church or group involvement.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#65:1> Functional features were assessed using Seeman and Syme 's three-item

Network Instrumental Support scale,23 which measures whether respondents

would " most likely" turn to friends or family for assistance with rides,

borrowing " a small sum of money," or household repairs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#66:1> Their four-item Network Emotional Support scale23 was abbreviated to

two items, only one of which had construct validity ( " Who would you turn to

for information or advice about a personal problem?").
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#67:1> This question, scored one for those who cited friends or family and

zero for others, resembles the emotional support item used by Strogatz and

James.35 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#68:1> The distribution of demographic characteristics was examined

among smoking status categories: never smokers, ex-smokers, current light

smokers, and current heavy smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#69:1> Analysis of variance with two-tailed pairwise t tests and

Bonferroni 's correction for multiple comparisons was used to contrast the

means of continuous variables.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#70:1> Chi-square analysis, with Yates'continuity correction for 2 x 2

tables, was performed on categorical variables.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#71:1> The Kruskal-Wallis procedure with two-tailed pairwise mean rank

comparisons and Bonferroni 's correction was applied to ordinal variables.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#72:1> Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to

determine whether social support and hassles contributed to explaining

smoking status after controlling for potential confounders.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#73:1> Heavy smokers and light smokers were aggregated because of their

similar characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#74:1> In the absence of data about when or why respondents quit, both never

smokers and ex-smokers were categorized as non-smokers in our primary

analyses.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#75:1> Independent variables included age ( with a quadratic term),gender,

educational status ( <12 years, 12 years, 13 through 15 years , and 216

years), household income ( transformed to optimize fit), health-specific

locus of control, and lack of awareness about the risk of smoking.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#76:1> These variables were selected on the basis of previous studies of

smoking correlates.2~36 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#77:1> The abbreviated hassles index was then added to the basic model

to determine the role of psychosocial stress, controlling for demographic and

attitudinal characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#78:1> Social support variables were added next, with the reference group

consisting of individuals with SNI = 4 ( optimal) and Network Instrumental

Support and emotional support scales greater than zero.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#79:1> To test the hypothesis that social support buffers the deleterious

effects of stress, interaction terms between the hassles index and the three

support measures were tested.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#80:1> All two-factor interactions involving demographics and social support

were evaluated by forward selection and backward elimination procedures.37

The significance level for entry and exit was ( = .10, with adjustment to

ensure that terms derived from a single variable entered together.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#81:1> Hierarchical models were compared with the likelihood ratio test.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#82:1> Finally, multivariate linear regression was used to determine

factors associated with self-reported daily cigarette consumption among

current smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#83:1> Multicollinearities prohibited inclusion of interaction terms in this

model.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#84:1> The PROC LOGIST and PROC REG programs in SAS were used for most

analyses.38 Odds ratios ( ORB) and 95&percent; confidence intervals ( CIs) were

calculated by exponentiating the logistic coefficient estimates.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#85:1> These Ors modestly overestimate the true risk ratios because the "

rare disease" assumption underlying the OR is not satisfied. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#86:1> <h> <bold> <it> Results </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#87:1> The total sample size was 1137, representing a response rate of

67.6&percent; in Oakland and 69.1&percent; in San Francisco.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#88:1> The age, gender, and income distributions of our sample closely

resembled 1980 census data from the same neighborhoods.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#89:1> The San Francisco and Oakland samples were almost equal in size ( 569

and 568, respectively) and showed similar demographic characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#90:1> Therefore, they have been combined for all analyses. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#91:1> Of the 1134 respondents who described their smoking habits, 36.0&percent;

never smoked, 22.1&percent; had quit smoking, 26.8&percent; were light smokers, and 15.1&percent;

were heavy smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#92:1> Current smoking was more prevalent among women than among men ( 43.1&percent;

vs 40.1&percent;), but female smokers were less likely than male smokers to consume

20 or more cigarettes daily. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#93:1> <h> <it> Sociodemographic Characteristics by Smoking Status </it>

</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-018#94:1> Table 2 illustrates how the sociodemographic characteristics of

current smokers differed from those of ex-smokers and never smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#95:1> Ex- smokers were significantly older than current or never smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#96:1> Ex-smokers were more than twice as likely to have graduated from

college as heavy smokers ( 15.6&percent; vs 7.1&percent;).
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#97:1> About 41&percent; of heavy smokers and 36&percent; of light smokers were separated or

divorced, compared with only 20&percent; of never smokers and 24&percent; of ex- smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#98:1> Current smokers reported lower household incomes than ex-smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#99:1> Heavy smokers had a particularly high frequency of disability (

15.4&percent;); both light and heavy smokers were more likely to be unemployed than

ex-smokers or never smokers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#100:1> Current smokers had higher hassle scores than either ex- smokers or

never smokers, whereas the latter two groups had higher SNI scores.
<ICE-USA:W2A-018#101:1> More than 15&percent; of heavy smokers denied a link between smoking and

cancer, as compared with 4&percent; of nonsmokers. </p> </I>
