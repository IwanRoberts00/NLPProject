the Caribbean"</h>
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#2:1> <h> by [ name deleted], 19 May 1994</h>
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#3:1> <h> A paper for Postcolonial Literature From the Anglophone Caribbean,

a course taught by Professor Mair.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#4:1> The British novelist, Graham Swift, has written-- In keeping with

his [ Phillips'] nomadic inclination, it could be said that one of the main

themes of his work is that of the journey or, rather differently, of human

displacement and dislocation in a variety of forms ( 96).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#5:1> Indeed, this theme of migration and its implications for the black

Caribbean individual is the central one explored in Phillips' first novel

entitled The Final Passage ( originally published in 1985).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#6:1> It is also the theme that will be examined in this essay both in close

relation to the text and in a wider historical and cultural context.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#7:1> The title of Phillips' first novel is rather provocative because

it refers to ( and depicts the " extension" of) the legacy of the Middle

Passage-- the second leg of the triangular trade that the European

imperialists established after they conquered much of the New World ( and

Africa); the impact of slavery on Caribbean history will be briefly discussed

( Richardson 38-9).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#8:1> In order to ( in)validate Phillips' " thesis" concerning modern

Caribbean migration, the portraits of his Caribbean characters on their "

final passage" will be analyzed with respect to the sociological realities of

immigration to the United Kingdom in the twentieth century.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#9:1> And finally, the implications of the " final passage"/migration for

the Caribbean writer will be discussed in regard to Phillips ( and other

authors).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#10:1> The legacy of colonialism in the Caribbean began, of course, with

Christopher Columbus in 1492.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#11:1> On his second journey to the Caribbean ( which he had mistaken for

islands off the coast of China) Columbus introduced sugar cane-the crop that

is nearly synonymous with the area today ( Richardson 27).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#12:1> Although economic interest in the Caribbean waned for a time ( due to

decline of the Spanish empire), the further introduction of sugar cane into

the region by other European powers ( i.e. the English and the French) firmly

established colonial rule by the mid-seventeenth century ( Richardson 29).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#13:1> Soon the plantation islands of the Caribbean were considered the most

valuable possessions of the overseas imperial world ( Richardson 39).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#14:1> In light of this fact, it is not surprising that there was a constant

state of instability in the Caribbean throughout the eighteenth century due

to trade wars--manifested in stringent trade laws and literal warfare--among

the European powers ( Richardson 55).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#15:1> In large part, this demand for sugar in Europe created the

Caribbean.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#16:1> To put it in more concrete terms, the European demand for sugar was

one of the key factors in setting up the notorious triangular trade-a " Negro

slave trade, Negro slavery, and Caribbean sugar production" ( Williams 140).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#17:1> Typically, a ship set sail from a European metropolitan country with

a cargo of metropolitan goods, which were then exchanged on the coast of West

Africa for slaves.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#18:1> This was the first side of the triangle.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#19:1> The second leg ( often referred to as the Middle Passage) consisted

of a voyage from West Africa to the West Indies with the newly purchased

slaves.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#20:1> The triangle was completed as the ships returned to the metropolitan

country with sugar and other Caribbean products which were gotten in exchange

for slaves ( Williams 141).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#21:1> This triangular trade created a market for slaves in West Africa

and the Caribbean and bolstered the economies of the European home countries

( William 140).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#22:1> The purchase of slaves in West Africa and their maintenance in the

Caribbean provided great stimulus to metropolitan industry and agriculture (

i.e.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#23:1> an increase in English wool production for clothing and blankets for

Caribbean slaves) ( Williams 141).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#24:1> In Europe, the triangular trade was the source of great wealth and

pride.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#25:1> It was the source of empires.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#26:1> In contrast, the triangular trade often meant tragedy for the

West Africans who were transported to the Caribbean.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#27:1> Besides the psychological blow of being captured, sold, and then

carried to the New World as a slave, many West Africans were subject to

malnourishment and disease on the Middle Passage; many slaves committed

suicide and tried ( unsuccessfully) to rebel against their captors (

Richardson 65).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#28:1> It is estimated that three out of ten slaves died on the Middle

Passage ( Williams 139).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#29:1> In the autobiography, The Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus

Vassa, the African, the former slave and anti-slavery crusader relates his

Middle Passage experience in this way--</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#30:1> ...I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such

a salutation to my nostrils as I had never received in my life; so that, with

the loathsomeness of the stench, and crying together, I became so sick and

low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the least desire to taste anything.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#31:1> I now wished for the last friend, death, to relieve me...(28).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#32:1> From this personal account, one can see that the Middle Passage

and imperialism in general had dire consequences for the Africans sold into

slavery.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#33:1> Slavery remained the primary means of Caribbean labor for

centuries until the last slaves were freed in Cuba in 1886 ( Richardson 63).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#34:1> It is estimated that 4.6 million African slaves were brought into the

region ( Richardson 63).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#35:1> The Middle Passage constituted one of the greatest migrations in

recorded history ( Williams 144).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#36:1> After the second World War, another great migration, involving

the Caribbean, occurred.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#37:1> From the 1955 to 1985, it is estimated that more than 4 million

Caribbean persons emigrated from the islands--a total equal to the number of

slaves brought into the area during the late seventeenth and eighteenth

centuries ( Guengant and Marshall 4-5).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#38:1> Throughout this thirty year span, a large section of the Caribbean

population travelled to the United States and to Canada, but early on (

throughout the fifties and early sixties) the United Kingdom was often their

destination ( Guengant and Marshall 4-5).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#39:1> The fateful consequence of the aftermath of WW II in Britain--the

need for unskilled labor to rebuild the nation after a war that had reduced

British manpower--led to an exodus of Caribbean people to the United Kingdom

in the 1950 's ( Richardson 142).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#40:1> Still, from the sociological data available, it is evident that this

exodus had not necessarily led the Caribbean emigrant to a place of greater

freedom or opportunity to rise in the world.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#41:1> Rather, it usually meant a continuation of the legacy of colonialism

despite the British Nationality Act of 1948 which had conferred the same

legal rights to the Commonwealth members accorded to all British citizens (

Thompson 41).</p>

<p> After arriving in Britain--the " mother country"-- most Caribbean persons

were given the worst jobs at the lowest pay, and they often had to live in

low-grade inner city housing--many of them in neighborhoods considered slums

long before the workers emigrated to the country ( Thompson 47).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#42:1> In general, a color bar was in place in Britain which denied the

majority of Caribbean people access to proper lodgings, service in cafes, and

entrance to dance halls, among other rights " accorded British citizens";

also, the emigrants were often subject to rude racial comments in public in

the trams, and in buses ( Thompson 47).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#43:1> In his fascinating book entitled Double Passage, George Gmelch

records the oral histories of thirteen Barbadian men and women who emigrated

to Britain ( and North America) and later returned their island homes.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#44:1> As varied and as rich as these oral histories are, Gmelch noticed a

common phenomena: many of the migrants were surprised upon their arrival to

England; many of them were shocked at the dilapidated conditions of

neighborhoods and dismayed at the distant and reserved manners of the British

white majority ( 264).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#45:1> Although many of the narratives showed that the migrants adjusted

rather well to their manual jobs as well as big city life and seemed

gratified with their relatively higher pay, Gmelch points out that most of

the Barbadians faced racial discrimination ( especially in regard to jobs and

housing) and had a Caribbean orientation as opposed to an assimiliationist

attitude in regard to England ( 267-70, 274-8).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#46:1> Perhaps all of this can be poetically summed up by the title of

the closing chapter in George Lamming 's The Pleasures of Exile; after all, it

is clear that many of the Caribbean emigrants, like Lamming, had been on a "

Journey To An Expectation."
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#47:1> Indeed, in this closing chapter, Lamming points out that any notion

that West Indian had been truly considered an equal in the eyes of the white

British majority was nothing but an " illusion" ( 218).
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#48:1> With bitter irony, Lamming finds it amazing that " a certain type

West Indian" would go to great lengths to assure white friends that life in

England has been nothing but a " memorable participation in civilised

pleasures" ( 218).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#49:1> Caryl Phillips picks up on Lamming 's thread and weaves a tragic

tale in The Final Passage.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#50:1> From the novel, one can see that Phillips has sufficiently portrayed

the plight of many Caribbean emigrants to the United Kingdom and that his "

thesis" concerning this social phenomena is more or less pessimistic.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#51:1> After reading the novel, one realizes that the " final passage" is

not the final leg of a Homeric journey where the hero is triumphant; rather,

it is the continuation of the legacy of the Middle Passage.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#52:1> This narrative--not unlike the ones in the Double Passage and the

other sociological data above-- reveals a difficult ( if not downright sad)

fate for the Caribbean individual in England.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#53:1> At the end, Leila, the main protagonist of the novel, decides to go

back to her sunny island home as all the Barbadians in the Double Passage did

( Final 203).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#54:1> Much of this elliptically told novel takes place on an

unspecified Caribbean island and focuses on four characters: Leila, a half

white, half black woman; Michael, her irresponsible husband; Millie, Leila 's

best friend; and Bradeth, Millie 's ( eventual) husband and Michael 's drinking

buddy.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#55:1> Two other characters, Leila 's mother and Leila 's son, Calvin, appear

throughout the book and play important roles in regard to main

protagonist.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#56:1> In the large chapter, " Home," Phillips paints a balanced

portrait of the Caribbean island, adequately depicting the island 's natural

beauty as well as the parochialism of many of its inhabitants.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#57:1> This reader had a difficult time with this section of the novel due

in large part to the heavy handed Christian symbolism ( i.e.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#58:1> the cock crowing, signifying Michael 's marital infidelity to Leila)

and the meandering narrative.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#59:1> This awkwardness of depicting the island is likely due to Phillips

having grown up in England and not in the Caribbean as many of the novelists

the previous generation had.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#60:1> For this essay, the chapters which make up the second half of the

novel-- " England", " Passage", and " Winter"--will be closely examined.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#61:1> It is in these chapters that Phillips' writing seems most assured and

that his mind seems to be at work most feverishly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#62:1> In the chapter called " England," Leila, Michael, and Calvin have

already spent four months in the " mother country."
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#63:1> The chapter opens with Leila on the bus, going to visit her mother in

the hospital for what she calculates to be her 106th time.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#64:1> ( It was revealed earlier that Leila 's forty-one year old mother had

gone to England to seek more sophisticated care ( 69).)
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#65:1> On one of the past visits Leila 's mother, squeezing her daughter 's

hand, says--"Leila, child, London is not my home....And I don't want you to

forget that either" ( 124).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#66:1> After some other motherly reflections on the pride of a Caribbean

woman in avoiding being beaten by a man, the chapter concludes as Leila

arrives at the hospital, finding that her mother has passed on.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#67:1> Leila laments her passing because " she barely knew her mother" and

feels guilty because she had rebelled against her mother by marrying her

despicable husband, Michael ( 132).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-004#68:1> In this short chapter, Phillips makes the finality implied in the "

final passage" rather obvious.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#69:1> Leila 's mother dies in a foreign country, far away from what she

considers home.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#70:1> Also, Leila 's hopes for making her peace with her mother and truly

getting to know her die there.
<ICE-USA:W1A-004#71:1> England is not the place in which final ( or ultimate) hopes ( i.e.

those of physical and spiritual renewal) are realized for black Caribbeans;

it is in fact a place for death of both physical life and spiritual hope.</p>
