<ICE-USA:W2F-012#1:1> <h> MISTAH LEE</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#2:1> <h> John Cho</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#3:1> Lee runs the rough blade of his cutlass across the ruddy, smooth

skin of the guinea mango; the chipped edge catches, piercing the epidermis,

slicing out cleanly a thick, convex piece, the sticky, acrid juice flowing

through his holding hand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#4:1> He sets aside the seed-exposed main body, cups the independent piece

in his hand and scores the almost translucent meat into a grid-like pattern

with the blunt blade-tip, criss-cross, criss-cross, I wonder if this seed

would take hold back home.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#5:1> He inverts the convexity into a concavity, the skin turned inside-out,

the flesh now exposed in bite-size rectangular chunks as if they grew that

way--discrete, logical, vulnerable.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#6:1> He bites into the slippery morsels, heedless of the mildly caustic

syrup that trickles down his jaw, throat, bare chest.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#7:1> A gust blows across the veranda where he is sitting, streaking the

juice across his abdomen. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#8:1> The dim outline of the Fouta Djalon mountains on the horizon is

rapidly being shrouded by the black-as-coal-smoke tropical cumulonimbus

clouds, thunderheads roiling over the top, silent lightning flashes

backlighting random sections.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#9:1> Lee flings the still inside-out skin, now bereft of all flesh,

frisbee-style, out toward the rice field.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#10:1> It soars amazingly far, its particular geometry creating an airfoil,

cutting across the strong wind, landing in a tangle of cassava plants.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#11:1> He is proud of this small discovery-he wonders if the ancient

Africans had little flying toys for their amusement.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#12:1> When Saidu comes for the evening water he will ask him if he knows

this trick. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#13:1> The temperature and light is decreased drastically as if night

had fallen prematurely.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#14:1> Watching vainly for signs of goosebumps on his body, Lee quickly

finishes the remainder of the mango and fetches and places a bucket under the

spout coming down from a corner of the roof. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#15:1> The wind is falling off.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#16:1> The first of the raindrops are announcing their arrival on the zinc

pan roof; scattered rim shots soon give way to a continuum of a thousand

snare drums beating, beating. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#17:1> As Lee continues to bask in the relative cool of the deflected

mist he notices a bucket bobbing up from the bramble bushes that lead down to

the swamp.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#18:1> The expected head then appears beneath the bucket, then the upper

body of a woman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#19:1> She is walking briskly and smoothly, spinal column perfectly

vertical, arms at the sides, the bucket swaying slightly to and fro but

stably as if it were just a decorative hat one put on nonchalantly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#20:1> As the path from the swamp to the village passed next to his house,

following custom, Lee had to greet everyone who went by.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#21:1> Sometimes he would duck inside his house when he spotted a group of

old women coming in from their farms--they spoke neither Krio nor English and

Lee was somewhat embarrassed and frustrated by his continuing inability to

learn Limba past the few basic phrases.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#22:1> They still derived a great deal of amusement from the mangled speech

of this whiteman, this grown man who preferred to wear shorts and who did not

have a wife to cook meals for him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#23:1> The full figure of the woman is now visible, the lower half

wrapped by a lappa, the torso plastered by a drenched T-shirt, the

inscription on which is faded and indecipherable from this distance.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#24:1> It is clear now that she is a young woman, her well-defined breasts

yet undrooped by the rigor of the child-rearing years.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#25:1> As she approaches his house her face remains obscured by the shadow

of the bucket, an anonymous figure within the isolating walls of the deluge.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#26:1> Lee prepares himself for a greeting, but the girl--she looks even

younger now--keeps moving up the path, head unturned by his existence, in

unbroken rhythm as if entranced.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#27:1> He can make out the words on the T-shirt: " Go climb the mountain.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#28:1> He recognizes it and realizes that she has it on backwards--the

phrase should be on the back, not the front.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#29:1> Acting upon some newly intransigent impulse he calls out to her. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#30:1> " Eh, sistah.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#31:1> You no de greet me?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#32:1> She turns her head slowly toward him, the extra moment of the

bucket resisting sudden rotation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#33:1> " Mistah Lee." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#34:1> With a little start he realizes that he knows this girl, then

after a short delay his mind assembles her identity: Fatmata Jalloh, pupil in

Form II.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#35:1> Not an outstanding student, somewhat lethargic, but socially

well-adjusted.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#36:1> She is particularly at a loss in his math class, but this doesn't

seem to weigh upon her mind, and as she looks at him now he feels no heat of

resentment, no opacity of shame in her eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#37:1> She stares at him, not moving, not saying anything further.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#38:1> Lee 's unsettling impulse falters for a moment but makes him continue.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#39:1> " Come here, Fatu." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#40:1> He switches to schoolhouse English and invests his words with the

authority of a teacher giving instruction.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#41:1> Wordlessly she comes to him on the veranda; she stays standing just

outside the cover of the roof, the bucket on her head catching the thicker

curtain that falls from the edge. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#42:1> " Put the bucket down and come under." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#43:1> Keeping her back straight she bends down on one knee then lowers

the bucket from her head.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#44:1> Water sloshes close to the rim; under its surface are the tight knots

of washed and wrung garments.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#45:1> She stands on the concrete floor of the porch, stares at the

amorphous puddles of water growing around her bare feet.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#46:1> Lee is squatting on a foot-high, woven raffia stool, watching her

static expression; he has seen this face many times before: the bank teller

in town eating a bean sandwich and sipping her lukewarm bottle of Vimto with

unbelievable languor, eyes in the general direction of the mildewy Krio sign

painted on the wall, " KEEP YOU KOPOH NAR BARCLAYS," while waiting

customers--"businessmen," market women, civil servants, farmers-stand

sweating in the crowded lobby, warding off with a " shilling" the occasional

beggar that wanders in, but each one mirroring the same mask of negation, an

anti-expression, that the teller wears signalling that time is suspended,

that no transactions are to take place at that moment; it is somehow like the

Taoist 's " uncarved block" and the mu on which Zen practitioners meditate;

and yet it is an effortless state and one from which the subject can abruptly

explode into violent laughter in response to a neighbor 's ribald joke.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#47:1> Whenever he confronts this wall ( as he perceives it), Lee feels

desperately alone. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#48:1> As he gazes up at Fatu, he feels an extension of the same strange

impulse that made him call out to her; for no reason that he could fathom his

heart is racing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#49:1> In a mock stern voice he says, " You know you should greet everyone

you meet, especially your own teacher." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#50:1> " Yes, Mistah Lee." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#51:1> God, what an asshole I'm being, 'mt it is only with the next

words that come out of his mouth that he understands why his pulse is

pounding in his stomach: " Fatu, let we go siddohn small." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#52:1> Fatmata Jalloh, daughter of a Fula entrepreneur who had wandered

south of the colonial border as a young man to start the first bread bakery

in Kukuna and a Limba mother who sold palm oil at the market, Fatu, at age

fourteen, a responsible member of the Bundu society, a good Moslem who said

her prayers then went to a Catholic secondary school where, uniformed in a

bright azure schooldress, she learned the skills necessary to be a fine,

modern African woman: English, History, Home Ec., P.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#53:1> E., Agric., Bible, Maths, Geography, Forensics, and Religious

Knowledge; she, who had inherited the caf&eacute; au lait complexion and the petite,

angular features of the Fula, raised her eyes at Lee, who was now standing,

and giggled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#54:1> It is, however, a momentary outburst.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#55:1> She quickly falls back to her previous state, eyes now staring past

the dried mango stains cutting diagonally across Lee 's smooth chest. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#56:1> Lightning strikes strobelight the squall-induced murk, thunder

arriving almost simulaneously as soft kicks in the gut.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#57:1> The proposition somehow being articulated by someone he barely

recognized, the border crossing completed, Lee now feels compelled, without

choice, to explore the new moral territory that has been handed to him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#58:1> His perceptions continue to operate displaced: he watches as his hand

reaches out to take Fatu 's arm, but force is not necessary, they move

together inside.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#59:1> He sees their journey in snapshots, each lightning stroke exposing

two portraits: Fatu 's tin bracelet flashing bridal-white and its dark image

on the wall, glimpse of a shadowy shackle.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#60:1> He reaches under his bed for the Peace Corps medical kit through

which he fumbles for a vestige of insensible sensibility; then under the

mosquito net they go, hands quickly denuding body of wet things. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#61:1> After a while it becomes clear that Fatu does not have any idea

of what is going on but is very aware of the idea of it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#62:1> Little gasps of pain and disjointed giggles; odd rushes of sadism and

alienation.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#63:1> The bed convulses in rhythm, its creaking cutting more and more

through the dying rain.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#64:1> Mosquitos can be heard riding their high-pitched notes, a cluster

chord in variable tuning, swarming along the folds of the netting, bouncing

their hungry bellies against the flexuous lattice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#65:1> Sweat streams down from his armpits, over the hip bones onto her

pinned thighs; she is otherwise perfectly dry, the effects of the rain

evaporated by her body heat; her skin silken, hairless, and absolutely

blemishless save for the Bundu scars on her cheek and upper pudendum.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#66:1> Sunlight is already beginning to break through the departing clouds;

the open window, guarded by two vertical " thief" bars, admits a sudden light

that projects the warped square grid pattern of the mosquito netting on the

supine body of Fatmata, malleable coordinates that shift with each jolt, the

smooth landscape of her body defined geometrically and arbitrarily moment by

moment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#67:1> As her eyes come into focus she turns her head away from the

brightness, her slender neck revealing perfect, taut sinews.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#68:1> The bed noise is alarmingly conspicuous without the rain, and soon

people will be walking about again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#69:1> For Lee privacy is still a precious commodity, but it only seems to

come to him in small increments here in Kukuna. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#70:1> Holiday...holiday...it would be so nice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#71:1> Saidu loved to feel the squish of wet laterite between his toes as he

dragged his feet along the puddles in the rutted path.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#72:1> He sang the refrain from the Madonna song over and over--he couldn't

remember the verses--in a soft, accurate voice that remarkably resembled the

original.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#73:1> She was not bad, but Michael Jackson was still his hero; every other

page of his Geography notebook was filled with lyrics of My-Kell 's hits from

" Rock with You" to " Beat It" in a stylized, florid handwriting using black

and red ball-point pens.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#74:1> One entire page was devoted to a sketch of the map of Mississippi,

U.S.A., with a miniature figure of the Moonwalker gliding across the city of

JACKSON, prominently marked in red and black ink.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#75:1> Saidu had discovered the home of his idol, not in Geography class,

but on the map of America that Bruce Lee had on his bedroom wall.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#76:1> His discovery was confirmed by Mr. Lee himself: " Oh yeah.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#77:1> The town was named after him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#78:1> He was, however, deeply disappointed when he learned that Bruce had

no cassettes of Michael Jackson; in fact, that had been the first question

that he had asked in class after Bruce had introduced himself as their new

maths teacher from the United States ( everyone was surprised; they had

assumed he was Chinese).
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#79:1> Of course, when they learned his name it became obvious who he really

was: Mr. Lee?
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#80:1> Bruce Lee, of course!
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#81:1> There was no denying it--he looked just like he did on screen except

a bit thinner.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#82:1> It didn't matter that Mr. Lee never admitted the fact--he was only

concealing his identity until those evil men with their chained and flying

weapons descended upon Kukuna in search of the Dragon.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#83:1> Then we'll 'll who 's who.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#84:1> Saidu " Golden Fox" Momoh and the Kung Fu King will defend this

village to the death! Ai-yaa! Golden Fox delivered a flying kick to the

malevolent trunk of a flamboyant tree. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#85:1> Hitching up the tan polyester shorts that were always threatening

to fall off the underside of his distended belly, Saidu suddenly paused to

listen closely: some strange noises were coming from the back of Bruce 's

house that was now in full view.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#86:1> Quietly he stepped closer to the building.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#87:1> He couldn't hear anything now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#88:1> Could it be...
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#89:1> But not sensing any aura of danger he decided to call out, " M-mistah

Lee! Mistah Lee, I have come for di watah!
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#90:1> After a momentary silence during which Saidu 's gaze darted around for

quick cover from flying knives, an answer came from the bedroom window, "

Saidu, didn't you notice the big rain?
<ICE-USA:W2F-012#91:1> I' 'vegot a whole bucketful from the roof." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-012#92:1> " A... Of course." Actually, Saidu knew perfectly well that Lee

wouldn't want water from the swamp today; he had hoped to listen to Lee 's

radio for a while--it was the best one in all of Kukuna. </p> </I>
