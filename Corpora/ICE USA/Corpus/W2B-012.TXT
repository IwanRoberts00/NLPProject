and a woman of different races.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#2:1> </quote> - - from Webster 's New World Dictionary</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#3:1> My parents grew up in segregated neighborhoods.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#4:1> Cynthia was raised in a small Texas town where everybody she knew was

white and Christian.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#5:1> Marty lived in a Jewish section of the San Fernando Valley in

California.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#6:1> His school was so Jewish-dominated that the team chant was " Hit 'em

in the kischkes!"<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>At some point during their courtship, which began during

their days at a less segregated high school, my mother decided to convert to

Judaism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#7:1> And so she did several years later, studying Jewish history and

culture with a reform rabbi and professor at UCLA where she was attending

college.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#8:1> But her ethnic transformation, although legal under reform Jewish law,

would never be complete.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#9:1> To my father 's parents, she was still an interloper.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#10:1> It was as if Christianity were written into her very DNA, as

unchangeable as blue eyes and blonde hair.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#11:1> And, I must admit, I have never thought of her as Jewish either.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#12:1> She is my WASP mother.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#13:1> So I have come to be an ethnic hybrid: half-WASP, half-Jew, the

product of two supposedly segregated identities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#14:1> Such a condition lends itself easily to jokes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#15:1> If you combine my heritage with that of my partner, you get one Jew

and one Christian.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#16:1> If you combine my heritage with my partner and our friends up the

street, you get 1.2 Jews, 2 British, .5 Scots-Irish, .5 Italian, .01 African

American, and of course the inevitable imaginary .0001 Native American.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#17:1> What this tongue-in-cheek laundry list of ethnicities manages to

explain--in a quite serious way--is the extent to which all racial identities

are already hopelessly miscegenated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#18:1> Nevertheless, the terms " race" and " ethnicity" grow out of the

old-fashioned idea that there are measurable, anatomical differences between

such groups that make them obviously distinct.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#19:1> Even " multiculturalism," a concept which suggests racial plurality,

takes for granted that racial groups can co-exist peacefully only by

maintaining cultural separations and particularities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#20:1> But I would argue that the " multiculture" might more aptly be

understood as a series of cultures that are being experienced all at once,

often in a single individual or group.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#21:1> The racial logic of multiculturalism should be conceived of as "

multiple and hybridizing," not as " separate and plural."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>To acknowledge

this, in my opinion, would simply be to admit what we've known all along 'vep>

<ICE-USA:W2B-012#24:1> </quote> - - Robert Stoller</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#25:1> For my parents' and grandparents' generation, being Jewish meant

being part of " the Jewish race."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>They were part of a not-quite-white

racial category, caught between assimilating into dominant WASP culture and

finding themselves cast out of it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#26:1> Although most Eastern European Jews could " pass" as white, their

religious and cultural heritage made them a breed apart, a group that would

have to be taught the ways of American Christianity ( implicitly, American

whiteness) whether they liked it or not.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#27:1> Although my father 's elementary school was 99 percent Jewish, they

were forced to have a Christmas pageant every year.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#28:1> My mother 's parents called Jews " clannish," accusing them memorably

of " eating greasy food."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>Telling me this story, my mother bursts out

laughing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#29:1> " A Southerner saying that someone else ate greasy food!" she snorts,

still incredulous after more than three decades.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#30:1> " I'm always amazed t 'mt Marty was able to like me," she adds, "

because he hated Christians so much."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>Once, when they were first dating, my

mother referred to Brazil nuts by the only name she knew, a name she had

learned in Texas: nigger toes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#31:1> Marty claims he intended never to speak to her again.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#32:1> I used to ask them all the time what brought them together into

the unlikely union that made me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#33:1> It all came down to a sandwich.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#34:1> " I saw Marty eating these gigantic sandwiches for lunch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#35:1> I'd only ever 'dd these white bread sandwiches, with one slice of

meat and mayonnaise.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#36:1> Maybe there would be a layer of lettuce, but I don't think so.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#37:1> I had to find out why this guy was eating such huge

sandwiches.?<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>It 's so American, that fetishization of the " other" through

food.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#38:1> We avoid thinking about the way " difference" often means "

subjugation" by trying to convert social identity into tasty, consumable

objects.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#39:1> Foreign identities become synonymous with the restaurants immigrants

build ( or through their simulation).
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#40:1> We come to know the other literally by consuming them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#41:1> But my mother was consumed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#42:1> They come to visit me, and I ask her about it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#43:1> " I had always assumed, not knowing that there could be any other

alternative, that Marty would convert to Christianity," she explains to me as

my father watches her from across the room.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#44:1> " But I would never have done that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#45:1> Never," he cuts in, " That just wasn't an option.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#46:1> Christians were the enemy."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#47:1> " But why did you want to be Jewish?" I ask Cynthia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#48:1> " Was it a way of escaping your family?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#49:1> " Yes, my family was very narrow-minded.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#50:1> Jews seemed cosmopolitan, sophisticated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#51:1> In Marty 's family, people talked out loud, and spoke their minds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#52:1> And they were a handsome family, not the stereotype of the wrinkled,

hunched people my mother imagined."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#53:1> " Cynthia 's father thought that since I was a Jew, I must be a

communist," my father remarks dryly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#54:1> " So you didn't want to be part of a group like that," I turn

back to my mother.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#55:1> " No, and I didn't want you to grow up with religious conflict.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#56:1> So I converted."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#57:1> " You know, I don't think of you as Jewish," I remind her, " and

didn't you think I might wonder why your mother celebrated Christmas?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#58:1> " Well no, I never thought of that," she replies, giggling.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#59:1> Then, seriously, " But I feel like a Jew, as if I have more in common

with Jews.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#60:1> People see me as Jewish.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#61:1> Maybe being Jewish did allow me to see my own culture, Southern

Christian culture, as somewhat alien.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#62:1> It seems alien to me now."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#63:1> My partner enters the conversation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#64:1> " People would definitely think you are a Jew," he says, " most Jews

would."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#65:1> It 's true.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#66:1> Cynthia has been Jewish for more of her life than she has been white.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#67:1> I, on the other hand, have been white and Jewish for exactly the same

amount of time.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#68:1> In fact, I have been white and Jewish simultaneously.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#69:1> One could argue that such an experience is the very essence of being

Jewish in the United States today, especially if you have pale skin and blue

eyes like I do.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#70:1> Looking at me, and many Jews, most people would think " white" rather

than " Jew."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>Yet the not-quite-whiteness of being Jewish has never gone

away.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#71:1> When I declare myself Jewish, or part-Jewish, people do respond to me

differently.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#72:1> Because being Jewish is not usually something people see immediately,

they can't prejudge me they way they would an African-American or

Asian-American.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#73:1> But once they know that I'm Jewish, ma 'm of their preconceptions

shift, and I seem suddenly strange.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#74:1> They have to gather more data to feel comfortable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#75:1> " Are you kosher?" they'll ask, 'll " Are you religious?"<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>Then

there 's my favorite, " Do you speak Jewish?"<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>I wouldn't describe any of

these questions as anti-Semitic, only as indicative of the way being Jewish

somehow marks you as " other," as needing some kind of an explanation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#76:1> When you're whit 'reit 's far more rare that you're ask 'reto explain

your identity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#77:1> Most people don't regard whiteness as a race, only as the absence of

it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#78:1> However wrongheaded this attitude may be, it 's the kind of " common

sense" that constitutes our first impressions of one another.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#79:1> <h> Williamsburg</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#80:1> I go out to breakfast with my partner 's family in Long Beach.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#81:1> His grandmother Dorothy, from the Jewish side of his family, is there

with her boyfriend, Charles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#82:1> We talk about the past.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#83:1> " I'm fro 'mWilliamsburg.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#84:1> Do you know it?" Charles asks me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#85:1> I don't.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#86:1> He is shocked, then amused.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#87:1> " It 's the Orthodox section of New York."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#88:1> " C'mon 'marles, they don't know about that," Dorothy teases him.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#89:1> But I'm in 'mrested; I'm al 'mys interested to hear about the past.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#90:1> I ask to know more.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#91:1> " My father wanted me to be a rabbi; he was very religious,"

Charles says, " But I rebelled because I wanted to be an engineer."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>I try

to imagine a scenario in which a Jew becoming an engineer would constitute

rebellion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#92:1> It 's like watching someone eat a sandwich stuffed with some bizarre

form of vegetable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#93:1> You want to get up close and find out what it is.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#94:1> " Wasn't it hard for Jews to get into college in those days?

Didn't they screen you to make sure they weren't admitting too many Jews?" I

ask, remembering my Ethnic Studies courses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#95:1> " Yes, that 's what they did," Charles says, " so I became a

teacher."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#96:1> Several months later, we go out to dinner with them in Los

Angeles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#97:1> Charles and Dorothy have just been to see me give a book reading in

which I talk about whiteness, and stereotypes of whiteness.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#98:1> " I never had to deal with white people when I was growing up,"

Charles says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#99:1> " It was Williamsburg.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#100:1> Do you know it?" He looks at me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#101:1> This time I do know it, and I remember.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#102:1> " Yes, I know Williamsburg.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#103:1> What you had to deal with was really horrible," I say, referring to

anti-Semitism in the early twentieth century.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#104:1> But in retrospect, I realize what I'v 'veaid is ambiguous.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#105:1> Charles takes me to mean that growing up in a restrictive Orthodox

environment was horrible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#106:1> He couldn't agree more.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#107:1> <h>
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#108:1> Miscegenation Blues</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#109:1> I think I must have tried, like every kid, to imitate my

parents' relationship.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#110:1> When I started dating, I developed a predilection for people who

came from a biracial or biethnic background.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#111:1> I also dated outside my race, usually ending up with

Asian-Americans, who enjoy the dubious privilege of having inherited the "

model minority" label once reserved for Jews.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#112:1> My first true love was Korean-American, and I was his ultimate "

other."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>His Christian, traditional parents were more than a little

reluctant to allow their only son to date a Jewish white girl.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#113:1> They referred to me as " that American girl."<ICE-USA:W2B-012#>When I came to visit

his family once, I was filled with shame when I awkwardly took off my shoes

inside the door, nearly stumbling in my effort to demonstrate cultural

sympathy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#114:1> What was ridiculous was that I took off my shoes to enter my own

house.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#115:1> I did it every day.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#116:1> And when we visited my parents' friends' houses, we did the

same--Asian customs were ordinary to me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#117:1> But I felt suddenly, stupidly white in that long-ago boyfriend 's

house.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#118:1> I was an invader, a son-stealer, grubby-fingered and clumsy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#119:1> Later that same year, his older sister, a church-going woman, came

home late one night to find him in bed with me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#120:1> That clinched it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#121:1> I was a slut, just like all the other white American girls.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#122:1> Being Jewish was easy compared to that.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#123:1> It made me interesting, gave me a special angle on things.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#124:1> I knew how stupid Christmas was several years before the other kids

knew it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#125:1> As a Jew, I could do things in the name of Judaism that would have

gotten someone else in trouble.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#126:1> I gave a book report to my ninth grade class on Philip Roth 's novel

The Ghost Writer, about a young man who is sexually obsessed with Anne Frank.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#127:1> Dressed as " the writer," I read a long soliloquy from the novel

which praised the erotic magnetism of a dead girl, the seductiveness of the

ultimate Jewish victim.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#128:1> What kind of teacher would risk forbidding me to read erotica out

loud to a ninth grade class when I was doing it for Judaism? Anti-Semitism

was not allowed at my high school, at least not out in the open.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#129:1> Once some boys in the hallway yelled, " Dirty Jew!" at me during

lunch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#130:1> I wheeled around, glowered, and screamed " FUCK YOU!" at the top of

my lungs, giving them the finger too, just for good measure.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#131:1> A teacher tried to upbraid me for yelling obscenities in the hall.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#132:1> " They called me a DIRTY JEW!" I said.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#133:1> " But is that how you should respond?" he asked condescendingly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#134:1> " Yes," I replied, and never heard another word about it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-012#135:1> When I think about race, fucking--even the word " fuck"--just

seem to come to mind.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#136:1> And I think of family, which most psychologists would agree is a

fairly typical connection to make.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#137:1> My sense of my own racial identity always comes back to my parents'

miscegenated romance, which has isolated our family from their families for

most of my life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#138:1> Fucking, and worse, breeding, is what made their union scary during

the early 1960s.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#139:1> Although there were other conflicts between my parents and their

families, I know--having seen the way those purebloods looked at me, the

mutant offspring of Jews and hicks--that they were disturbed by what I might

represent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#140:1> I was the hybrid corruption of their own segregated cultures, proof

that Jews and whites could mate and even produce something pretty, something

smart, something that could yell " FUCK YOU!" and not be sorry at all.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#141:1> I was the living embodiment of their racial and sexual

transgression.
<ICE-USA:W2B-012#142:1> And I knew it.</p> </I>
