<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#1:1> The attorney who formerly defended a sheriff 's narcotics officer

who developed a cocaine addiction didn't learn of the officer 's drug problem

until Feb. 18, 1999, the attorney testified today during the first day of

John Frank Good 's perjury trial.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#2:1> Good will testify during his defense, Good 's defense attorney,

Leonard Robinson, told a Shawnee County District Court jury on Monday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#3:1> William K. Rork, the attorney who defended Timothy P. Oblander,

who had the cocaine addiction, was the second witness to be called to the

witness stand on Monday by Good, a former deputy, who is being tried on two

charges of felony perjury.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#4:1> Good, who was a sergeant when he was fired earlier this year from the

sheriff 's department, is charged with two counts of perjury stemming from his

testimony on Feb. 22, 1999, and March 10, 1999, in Shawnee County District

Court during which he denied knowing Oblander had used illegal drugs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#5:1> On Feb. 17, 1999, Oblander signed a release so Rork could look at

Oblander 's treatment records at Valley Hope, an alcohol and drug

rehabilitation center at Atchison.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#6:1> Rork said he read that Oblander had been treated at the center for

cocaine dependency.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#7:1> " I was shocked," Rork said, who testified Oblander earlier told

him he was treated at Valley Hope for an alcohol problem.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#8:1> " If he had told me the truth, he would never have been charged with a

crime.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#9:1> He would have continued to take the Fifth Amendment."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#10:1> Oblander was charged with six counts of perjury and one count of

official misconduct.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#11:1> The perjury counts stemmed from lying while testifying on Jan. 20,

1999, and Feb.22, 1999, in district court, court records said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#12:1> The official misconduct charge stemmed from using illegal drugs, then

lying about his drug use, according to court records.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#13:1> Oblander agreed to a diversion agreement in exchange for his

testimony against Good and former Sheriff Dave Meneley.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#14:1> About Feb. 26, 1999, Rork told Oblander that the deputy was in a

" world of trouble" for lying to the court that he hadn't used cocaine.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#15:1> Three days later, Oblander issued a public statement saying he had

dual addictions of cocaine and alcohol.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#16:1> Oblander, who was called to the witness stand by Good, testified

that he told Good about his drug addiction.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#17:1> Oblander never told Good about his drug addiction, did he? Robinson

asked Oblander.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#18:1> " Yes, I did," Oblander said, " before I went into treatment" in

late June 1995.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#19:1> Oblander said he " gave little detail" to Good about his drug

addiction.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#20:1> In his opening statement, Robinson said jurors would not only

find Good not guilty but also innocent of the perjury charges.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#21:1> Robinson told jurors that charges against Good were a way to get

Meneley, who was Shawnee County sheriff when he was charged with two counts

of perjury in April 1999.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#22:1> Two deputies, Detectives Jack Metz and Scott Holladay, have testified

that Good told them about Oblander 's cocaine addiction and that Meneley knew

about Oblander 's problem.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#23:1> Robinson told jurors he thinks Metz and Holladay learned of

Oblander 's drug problem from the drug counselor who was to provide counseling

to Oblander after he finished his one-month treatment at Valley Hope.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#24:1> Robinson said Assistant Attorney General James Welch was trying

to make points with Attorney General Carla Stovall when he testified that

Good told him of Oblander 's drug use.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#25:1> In February, Meneley was ousted from the sheriff 's office after

two Shawnee County District judges ruled that Meneley twice gave false

testimony while under oath and once concealed evidence, all linked to the

sheriff 's department drug scandal.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-003#26:2> <h> Depth of river causing concern</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#27:2> <h> By MIKE HALL</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#28:2> <h> The Capital-Journal</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#29:2> That bottled water you stockpiled for Y2K may still come in handy

if northeast Kansas doesn't get rain soon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#30:2> It is a little too early to start filling washtubs with water,

but the people who watch this sort of thing are beginning to be a little

concerned.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#31:2> Topeka Water Superintendent Don Rankin is keeping watch on the

statistics on the depth of water in the Kansas River, the only source of

drinking water for Topeka-area water customers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#32:2> He has the power to impose water conservation measures on those

customers but isn't making any predictions on the likelihood of that

happening.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#33:2> The river is low, but he doesn't have any specific depth that

automatically triggers the water conservation plan.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#34:2> " It 's kind of a relative thing," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#35:2> " The river gets this low every year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#36:2> The problem is that it 's usually in September."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#37:2> Besides watching the depth gauge at the water treatment plant on

the south bank of the Kansas River near S.W. MacVicar, Rankin also is

watching some Web sites maintained by various government agencies.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#38:2> The Kansas Water Office, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and

U.S. Geological Survey all have Web sites with useful data.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#39:2> For example, the Corps of Engineers site showed that the level of

water in the river dropped to 5.41 feet as of Friday, down from 6.26 feet the

previous Friday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#40:2> That measurement is taken by a gauge near the Sardou Bridge in

Topeka.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#41:2> Two measurements of the river level are used by the government

agencies.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#42:2> Besides the depth in feet, the other measurement is the number of

cubic feet of water that pass by a certain point in one second.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#43:2> The Corps site showed 1,429 cubic feet per second, or CFS, were

flowing through Topeka on Friday compared with 2,663 CFS the previous

Friday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#44:2> Historical tables supplied by the U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#45:2> Geological Survey site show the typical river flows in Topeka range

from highs of 70,000 CFS to lows in the range of the current level.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#46:2> But as Rankin indicated, the lows typically occur in September, with

summertime river levels often in the range of 5,000 CFS.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#47:2> At the height of the 1993 flooding, 170,000 CFS were flowing

through Topeka.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#48:2> The Kansas Water Office Web site maintains frequently updated "

Drought Reports" indicating the presence or absence of moisture in the

various parts of the state.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#49:2> The June 7 report placed much of northeast Kansas in the " severe

drought" category, a downgrading of the previous week 's rating of " moderate

drought."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#50:2> Those ratings are based on a numerical system called the Palmer

Drought Severity Index.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#51:2> The Palmer index rates an area between +4, meaning extremely wet, and

- 4, meaning extreme drought.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#52:2> To be considered in serious drought, an area has to have a Palmer

rating between - 3 and - 3.99.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-003#53:3> <H> Support group uses alternative approach</H>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#54:3> For those infected with or affected by the HIV virus or AIDS, a

new grass-roots service is available that uses a different approach from

other social services.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#55:3> Sojourn, a nonprofit organization located at 817 S.W. 6th, opened

in April and serves 11 counties in northeast Kansas.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#56:3> It was founded in June 1998 on the belief that people infected with

or affected by HIV/AIDS should live whole, independent and meaningful lives.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#57:3> It takes an holistic approach to helping clients.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#58:3> " We're dealing with 'ree physical, emotional and spiritual," said

co-founder Melba Sutton.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#59:3> " There are some alternative ways of looking at this disease and

becoming more attuned to the spiritual."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#60:3> Sojourn is a project of the Tides Center, a nonprofit

organization that has offices in San Francisco and Washington D.C. The Tides

Center provides management and funding to about 300 projects in the United

States and internationally.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#61:3> " It 's a framework to help grass roots organizations get started

up," Sutton said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#62:3> But Sojourn also gets funding from individual donations.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#63:3> Another source is the Ryan White Title II Care Program Case

Management funding from the AIDS section of the Kansas Department of Health

and Environment 's Bureau of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention for state

fiscal year 2001 starting in July.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#64:3> Sutton is Sojourn 's Ryan White case manager.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#65:3> " It enables a lot of our clients to receive services they would

not typically receive," Sojourn co-founder, Susan Tusher said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#66:3> " It 's an on-going search for grant support."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#67:3> Also on staff is Elizabeth Gowdy, the evaluation, technical

assistance and training expert for the organization.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#68:3> Gowdy, like Tusher and Sutton, received her master 's degree in social

work from The University of Kansas.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#69:3> All three are licensed to practice in Kansas.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#70:3> Gowdy just received her Ph.D in social work.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#71:3> All three work on a volunteer basis and there are no paid staff until

July 1, Sutton said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#72:3> Besides taking a different approach in its service, Sojourn is

also client-driven and that is important, Tusher said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#73:3> " The client voice is primarily why we exist.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#74:3> They all have equal say in what we do and how we do it," Tusher said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#75:3> " Our philosophy is fairly unique in social services in general.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#76:3> We're here no 'reust for the person but also as a support

network."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#77:3> The group works to identify client needs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#78:3> " Every level of service we currently or will provide has their

input," Sutton said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#79:3> She said when clients come in for help, the staff sits down and

discusses their needs - - financial, medical or spiritual assistance and

emotional support - - and gives them a list of services Sojourn can

provide.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#80:3> " They are the directors for their needs," Sutton said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#81:3> " They are their own experts."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#82:3> And clients don't have to be infected with HIV/AIDS to get help.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#83:3> Sojourn also assists those who know someone that is infected.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#84:3> " It 's those people who have someone in their family infected

with HIV/AIDS," Sutton said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#85:3> " ( Family) could be defined as friend, spouse or partner." Tusher

said it was anything the client defined as family.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#86:3> " I think it 's very important that it 's the infected person 's

definition not the standard definition of what a family is," she said.</p>

<ICE-USA:W2C-003#87:4> <h> Suspect arrested in minutes</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#88:4> Police arrested a Topeka man minutes after he allegedly robbed a

downtown fast-food restaurant late Saturday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#89:4> Daniel R. Gonzales, 20, was arrested shortly after a robbery at

Wendy 's, 728 S.W. Topeka Blvd.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#90:4> Gonzales was booked into jail less than an hour after the robbery

occurred, according to police and jail records.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#91:4> At least two employees and one other person was inside the

restaurant during the robbery, which began at 11:35 p.m.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#92:4> and ended seven minutes later, reports indicated.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#93:4> The robber gained entry into the restaurant when he broke a glass

door with a blunt object.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#94:4> He then left with an undisclosed amount of cash.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#95:4> No one was injured in the robbery, but one employee told officers

the robber threatened him with the weapon, reports showed.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#96:4> Officers arrived four minutes after the burglary was reported and

apprehended Gonzalez, who reports indicated was suspected of using alcohol,

near S.W. 8th and Topeka Boulevard.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#97:4> Gonzales, who listed an address of 1834 S.W. Clay, was booked

into the Shawnee County Jail at 1:20 a.m. in connection with aggravated

robbery, aggravated assault, aggravated burglary and criminal damage to

property, all felonies.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-003#98:5> <h> Mental intensity helps Bottalico regain edge
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#99:5> <h> By KEN CORBITT
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#100:5> <h> KANSAS CITY, Mo. - - Relaxed intensity.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#101:5> That was the contradictory mindset Kansas City Royals pitcher

Ricky Bottalico took to the mound in the 11th inning of a tie game Saturday

night.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#102:5> Confusing as it may sound, Bottalico had the right frame of mind

to shut down the Pittsburgh Pirates for two innings as the Royals won 2-1 in

12 innings at Kauffman Stadium.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#103:5> " It 's weird that I say I was relaxed but I was intense at the

same time," Bottalico said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#104:5> " They are two different things, but I definitely went out there

with a lot more intensity than I have in the past."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#105:5> The Pirates tied the game 1-1 in the ninth inning when Adrian

Brown 's single drove in Kevin Young from second base after Royals starter Mac

Suzuki was one out away from a shutout.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#106:5> But Mike Sweeney delivered the victory in the 12th with a single

that scored Johnny Damon, who led off the inning with a single and advanced

to second base on a sacrifice by Luis Ordaz.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#107:5> " Suzuki pitched a great game and came one out away ( from a

win)," Bottalico said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#108:5> " It was ( the bullpen 's) job to keep them where the game was.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#109:5> Dan Reichert did a great job and Sweeney came through at the end.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#110:5> It was a complete team game."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#111:5> Bottalico, whose troubles cost him the closer 's job, earned the

victory.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#112:5> He ( 5-1) gave up two hits and one intentional walk with three

strikeouts after taking over for Reichert at the start of the 11th

inning.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-003#113:5> " Ricky 's probably a little upset that he 's not getting the ball

in certain situations, but he pitched awfully well," manager Tony Muser said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-003#114:5> " He was, to me, very determined when he came in that game."</p>
