<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#1:1> Working within the same intellectual boundaries, the English were

able to conceptualize the Union as a marriage in which the partners were

different but compatible and, at least in theory, not unequal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#2:1> The subservience of the feminine partner was natural, but not a matter

of inferiority.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#3:1> The utility of this discourse rested upon the ability of the

English to represent the Irish as feminine and the English as masculine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#4:1> In doing so the English were able to draw on a long standing tradition

on both sides of the Irish Sea for, though the reconceptualization of the

union as a marriage was a product of the early nineteenth century,

perceptions of the two peoples had been gendered for centuries, if not

always.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#5:1> English accounts dating back to Giraldus Cambrensis feminize the Irish

as, indeed, do accounts by the Irish themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#6:1> William Carleton and other Irish writers reinforced this gendered

discourse in the nineteenth century, portraying impulsiveness, sensitivity

and aptitude for poetry and music as fundamental Irish character traits.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#7:1> In The Black Prophet, for example, Carleton used the feminine

character of Sarah M'Gowan to represent Ireland 's needs and potential: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#8:1> It is impossible to say to what a height of moral grandeur and

true greatness culture and education might have elevated her, or to say with

what brilliancy her virtues might have shown, had her heart and affections

been properly cultivated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#9:1> Like some beautiful and luxuriant flower, however, she was permitted

to run into wildness and disorder for want of a guiding hand; but no want, no

absence of training, could ever destroy its natural delicacy, nor prevent its

fragrance from smelling sweet, even in the neglected situation where it was

left to pine and die. ( 22) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#10:1> The unlucky but desirable figure of Hibernia thus appeared a

natural mate for John Bull, whose own qualities could bring her potential

beauty to fruition.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#11:1> Anna Maria Hall, another Irish writer, confidently believed that

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#12:1> a union, based on mutual interests, is rapidly cementing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#13:1> The insane attempts to procure 'Repeal' may retard, for a time, a

consummation for which every upright British subject must devoutly wish; but

a growing intelligence and increasing intimacy are barriers which the

advocates of the measure will vainly endeavour to break down. ( 23) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#14:1> In the English-Irish union, the partners were considered not

unequal, but different; the English would realize themselves through the

practition of a public and masculine role within the marriage, while the

Irish would find their destiny in a feminine and domestic role.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#15:1> Integration of the two through " consummation" of the marriage would

result in each making the other whole, bringing English values to the Irish

and Irish values to the English.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#16:1> As John Garwood argued, the Irish possessed

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#17:1> in spite of all their social degradation, a peculiarity of

character which would blend most usefully with that of their Saxon

neighbours.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#18:1> The English labourer, with all his manliness and honesty, is often

wanting in intellectual acuteness and in imaginative glow.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#19:1> In both these characteristics the Irish excel. . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#20:1> I do think that a few rays of Irish imagination, a little more play

of fancy, more exuberance of joyousness, and more brightness of hope, would

greatly add to the happiness of our own poor. . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#21:1> I would put more good sense into the Irishman, and more poetry into

the Englishman.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#22:1> And in this way I cannot but hope that even intellectually, morally,

and socially, they may do each other good; and that the English character,

retaining its own solidity, may acquire the gracefulness of the Irish, and

while equally useful, become more pleasing, demand as much of our

approbation, and more engage our love. ( 24) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#23:1> The subordinate role of Ireland in the English-Irish marriage

was, however, always clear.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#24:1> Though different in fact, the Irish would lose their separate

identity in marriage - right down to the adoption of their " husband 's" name:

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#25:1> As a family name [ Anglo-Saxon] does not exclude the Celt,

whether Irish, Scotch, or Welsh; the two families are rapidly blending into

one, and it is only natural to retain the name of the predominating element.

( 25)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#26:1> Hibernia could not survive independently.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#27:1> As James Johnson argued, </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#28:1> A repeal of the Union would eventually divorce Hibernia from John

Bull 'a mensa et thoro ' - and that without alimony of maintenance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#29:1> It is true that she might, perhaps, be at liberty to form another

matrimonial connexion - but with whom would this new liason be? Johnny

Crapaud - or Cousin Johnathan?
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#30:1> Hibernia is not of the constitution to live in blessed singleness

during the remainder of her life. ( 26) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#31:1> Once domesticated, however, the Irish would prove happy and

congenial partners in the Union.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#32:1> Samuel Smiles approvingly cited an unknown author as saying that</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#33:1> the Irish are indeed a tractable nation, and though they have

resisted chains of iron, they may easily be conducted by a kindly hand with a

silken thread. ( 27) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#34:1> The English and many Irish therefore maintained an optimistic

belief that Irish moral and social improvement would follow on their

domestication through the spread of English law; reconciled in the marital

bliss of the Union, the two peoples would become friends and allies.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#35:1> The potato blight of 1845 and the famine that followed from 1846

to 1852 appeared to English Liberals as a God-given opportunity to teach the

Irish the value of English middle-class morality and learning.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#36:1> The efforts of English and Scotch scientists and agriculturalists to

tutor the Irish peasants in methods of facing the crisis were hailed by the

Times, which noted with relish the inability of O'Connell and other Irish

leaders to fend off the impending disaster.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#37:1> Indeed, in the first stages of the potato blight many English men and

women believed that the famine would be a perfect occasion to divorce the

Irish from the Repeal movement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#38:1> The Times encouraged this by arguing that O'Connell 's continued

collection of the Repeal rent showed that he " did not care" about his

people, and should therefore be abandoned by the peasantry in favor of John

Bull. ( 28)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#39:1> Fired with confidence in the abilities of the enlightened middle

class to provide for Ireland in time of dearth, most English shared Sir James

Graham 's confidence that </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#40:1> Ireland itself is softened in all its parts by their [ sic]

sudden calamity; and capable of receiving new permanent impressions, if a

master-hand can be found to direct them. ( 29) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#41:1> The failure of free trade and middle-class science to prevent

starvation, however, worked to destroy this confidence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#42:1> It became all too easy for the English to blame the Irish for

Ireland 's miseries rather than to question the middle-class ideals in which

the English had placed such faith.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#43:1> The reluctance of the traditionally-minded peasantry to accept the

often bizarre advice of English scientists gave the latter an excuse to

exculpate themselves and blame the peasants for the progress of blight and

dearth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#44:1> Robert Traile was one of these agriculturalists who visited Ireland

with grandiose plans to teach the peasantry to ventilate their potato pits,

which he was convinced would save the country from famine.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#45:1> His frustration at his failure to do so was vented on the peasantry,

as in the following message to Peel:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#46:1> I found the miserable apathy, the unmanageable doggedness, of the

people, who would not move a hand, but folded their arms to wait, in

listlessness & torpid stupidity, the ruin of the food of themselves & their

families. ( 30) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#47:1> As the distress deepened and Irish appeals for help multiplied,

the mood of the ministers became more pessimistic but still determined: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#48:1> we shall succeed in the end.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#49:1> It will not be for many a long month, or many a long year perhaps

that we shall get the people in that country to do their duty decently. ( 31)

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#50:1> More and more, however, the Irish began to seem a threat to

English prosperity, particularly as the dearth spread to Europe and England

suffered from financial panics driven by railway speculation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#51:1> Irish despair at the blight and famine increasingly appeared to the

English as a parasitical desire to live off the wealth of their neighbors,

with the inevitable result that England and Scotland would have to feed the

whole of the Irish population.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#52:1> In the mind of the Whig Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Charles

Wood, this was the product of " the universal disposition to do as little for

themselves, & to throw as much upon the Government as possible."(32)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#53:1> By 1848 Lord Clarendon, the Whig Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was like

many of his countrymen fuming that " it is difficult to know how to deal with

such a perverse people." ( 33) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#54:1> By the middle of 1847 the English public had lost interest in

charitable donations to the Irish.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#55:1> The Times both reflected and irresponsibly fed this attitude,

complaining that " the working population of this country is dividing its

last loaf with Ireland,"(34) a sacrifice for which the Irish were in any case

ungrateful, since " we send money to Ireland and it is used as the price of

sedition and to buy firearms."(35)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#56:1> The government 's decision to cut off aid outside the Irish Poor Law

in the summer of 1847 was therefore popular in England.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#57:1> The famine and the 1848 Young Ireland rising began, indeed, to

make the " sister island" appear more an object of fear than desire.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#58:1> The emigration of Irish paupers to England and Scotland, which had

been going on for decades, added to English fears, coming after 1847 or so to

seem increasingly ominous, like the spread of a moral and physical disease.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#59:1> English workers reacted to the Irish influx with particular fright,

and, stirred by Protestant evangelical demagogues, sometimes greeted the

Irish with violence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#60:1> George Poulett Scrope, an economist ostensibly sympathetic to Irish

suffering, feared that continuing immigration would " spread through Britain

the gangrene of Irish poverty, Irish disaffection, and the deadly paralysis

of industry that necessarily attends upon these elements of evil."(36)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#61:1> Further intercourse between the two nations might therefore result

only in the spread of infection.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#62:1> Even the longstanding belief in Irish fertility disappeared for a

time, though England remained tied to Ireland for better or for worse.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#63:1> English capitalism and money had not impregnated Hibernia; or, if it

had, it may only have helped give birth to a monster: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#64:1> The money which the English government disburses, and the English

people pay, is not wholly barren or unproductive.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#65:1> It has its harvests, though not of the plough or the sickle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#66:1> It has its fields, but not of peaceful fertility and gladdening

richness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#67:1> Its crop is not the golden corn, but the steel blade; it has wrought

bayonets for sickles, and firelocks for mattocks. ( 37) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#68:1> Though some writers such as John Garwood remained optimistic

concerning the ultimate potential of the Anglo-Irish marriage, they were

increasingly the exception rather than the rule after 1850.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#69:1> Disgust at the " unreasonable" behavior of the Irish dampened

enthusiasm for a more intimate Union.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#70:1> Instead, the British began to turn to a new discourse that justified

British rule on the basis of Irish racial inferiority.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#71:1> A minority of scientists and intellectuals, writing in journals

such as the Medical Times, had long maintained a racialist interpretation of

Irish difference; but before the famine their ideas were rarely supported in

Parliament or the popular press.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#72:1> The experiences of the famine, however, in conjunction with the

efforts of newspapers like the Times, served to popularize biological racism

as it was applied to the Condition of Ireland Question.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#73:1> By the beginning of the 1850s explicitly or implicitly racialist

literature spread widely through the press and in bookshops, and was received

with much acclaim.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#74:1> Many Liberals persisted in criticizing racialism, but for the

remainder of the century the public would pay them as little heed as they had

to the racialists before the famine.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-010#75:1> Robert Knox 's work The Races of Men ( 1850) was the first and

most influential of a series of racialist works.
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#76:1> Knox triumphantly rejected the Liberal understanding of the Irish

question, which he characterized as being based upon " long-received

doctrines, stereotyped prejudices, [ and] national delusions."(38)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#77:1> Sneering at those who, like John Bright, continued to seek the future

moral reformation of Ireland, Knox declared that " the source of all evil

lies in the race, the Celtic race of Ireland."(39)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#78:1> Significantly, he went out of his way to deny the possibility of

long-lasting results from " the admixture of race by intermarriage."(40)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#79:1> Celt would always remain Celt, and Saxon would always remain Saxon: "

The possible conversion of one race into another I hold to be a statement

contradicted by all history."(41)
<ICE-USA:W2B-010#80:1> Finally, Knox savaged Liberal ideals of an intimate and fruitful

marriage in the Union with the simple statement that " Ireland is not a

colony, but merely a country held by force of arms, like India; a country

inhabited by another race." ( 42) </p> </I>
