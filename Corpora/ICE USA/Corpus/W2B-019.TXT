<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#1:1> A few years ago, when Sara Franklyn 's phone rang before 8 A.M. or

after 9 P.M., she often wouldn't answer it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#2:1> Why bother?
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#3:1> She knew it was a just another creditor calling about her unpaid

bills.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#4:1> Though she made an impressive salary as a telecommunications

consultant, Sara, now 32, just couldn't control her spending.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#5:1> " I'd go into a store," she 'dys, " and spend five hundred dollars on

clothes when my rent wasn't paid."
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#6:1> Finally, she got help from a financial counselor and started paying

off her

&dollar;10,000 debt.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#7:1> Today she spends very carefully and is much happier.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#8:1> " Nothing I'd ever bought," she says 'd" was worth that panicky

feeling." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#9:1> Salary:

&dollar;100,000</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#10:1> Take-home pay: As a freelance telecommunications consultant, Sara

nets about

&dollar;8,000 a month.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#11:1> After taxes, that comes to about

&dollar;4,500 a month. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#12:1> Credit cards: American Express ( because it must be paid in full

every month) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#13:1> Average balance on card:

&dollar;800 a month</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#14:1> Method of payment: She pays the bill immediately. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#15:1> Loans:

&dollar;10,000 student loan (

&dollar;200 a month at 7-percent interest) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#16:1> Rent: She recently moved from a

&dollar;1,600-a-month apartment to a

&dollar;1,300-a- month apartment in Manhattan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#17:1> " It makes a huge difference." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#18:1> Balances checkbook: Once a month with Quicken, a computer

software program.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#19:1> " It computes everything for you." </p>

&dollar;3,000</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#21:1> Average savings-account balance:

&dollar;15,000 in a passbook savings account.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#22:1> " It only earns three percent interest." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#23:1> Other investments:

&dollar;2,000 certificate of deposit</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#24:1> Average phone bill:

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#25:1> Other expenses: She pays for her own health insurance; cost:

&dollar;250 a month with

&dollar;170 annual deductible. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#26:1> Who pays for dating: " Men and women who make similar money

should share expenses.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#27:1> But on a first date, a man should pick up the tab." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#28:1> Amount spent on clothing: " I recently bought a summer suit, but

that 's very rare these days.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#29:1> I even avoid window-shopping because I still get those urges to go in

and buy a million things." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#30:1> Where she shops: She shops discount outlets for big purchases or

when she needs a lot of things. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#31:1> Most ever paid for an article of clothing:

&dollar;800 for a leather jacket.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#32:1> " It was back in the old days.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#33:1> I spent years paying it off.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#34:1> I wouldn't do that now." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#35:1> Amount spent on restaurants: She eats out about four times a

week.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#36:1> " Restaurants are really my main source of entertainment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#37:1> I'll spend up to twenty-two 'llllars on an entree." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#38:1> Amount spent on movies and entertainment: She buys theater

tickets six times a year, but she always buys discount tickets. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#39:1> Where she gives money:

&dollar;200 a year to cancer research</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#40:1> Haircut:

&dollar;50, and a

&dollar;10 tip</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#41:1> Makeup: Clinique, Lancome and Biotherm.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#42:1> She spends

&dollar;60 on a Biotherm cream.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#43:1> " It might be irrational, but I love it." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#44:1> Where she is most extravagant: " These days, I can't think of

anything." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#45:1> Where she scrimps: " I used to just jump on a plane when I got

bored.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#46:1> Now that 's rare, and I no longer get on the phone and make a million

long- distance calls." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#47:1> Purchase she most regrets in the last six months: " None, but

recently I almost bought a two thousand-dollar Persian rug.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#48:1> In the end, I'm glad I didn't do it.
<ICE-USA 'm2B-019#49:1> I'd rather save money fo 'dother things - like buying a place to

live." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#50:1> Best purchase: " I recently bought a two thousand two

hundred-dollar computer so that I can work at home.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#51:1> I paid for it all at once.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#52:1> If I can't afford to buy things that way, I don't buy them." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#53:1> Top price she would pay for: Blouse: " I start sweating at sixty

dollars"; cocktail dress:

&dollar;250; jeans:

&dollar;30 at the Gap</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#54:1> On a

&dollar;12 lunch tab, she would leave:

&dollar;15.50</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#55:1> She dines out with a group of people who have entrees and wine,

while she has soup and salad.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#56:1> Someone says, " Let 's split it."
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#57:1> what does she do?: " I might say something if I spent six dollars,

and I was going to have to put in twenty-five dollars.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#58:1> Some might think that cheap, but most would understand." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#59:1> Five-year plan: " I'd like to buy a home, 'dnd have savings in a

retirement fund that are accessible." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#60:1> When it comes to money, most of us can probably see a little of

ourselves in these four women.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#61:1> Whether it 's buying an expensive jacket on a whim, watching unopened

bills gather dust ( and interest due) or keeping savings in a checking

account, many women have been there.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#62:1> So how do these typical women stand up to the scrutiny of financial

experts? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#63:1> " Ann Marie, like a lot of women at twenty-six, just isn't paying

attention to money, says Shelby White, author of What Every Woman Should Know

About Her Husband 's Money ( Turtle Bay Books, 1992).
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#64:1> " She has a good salary, but it isn't reflected at all in her

savings."
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#65:1> " Ann Marie needs to make a lifestyle change," says Frances Leonard,

author of Women & Money.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#66:1> An Independent Woman 's Guide to Financial Security For Life (

Addison-Wesley, 1991).
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#67:1> " She simply must learn to say, 'Maybe I'll skip that potte 'llclass

this year.'"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#68:1> Because she clearly has no real interest in bargains--"She didn't

want to go out of her way to get those cheaper tights, and that was a real

savings," Leonard notes-Ann Marie should find out if her company offers a

voluntary long-term savings plan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#69:1> Under these plans, called 401(k)s, companies automatically deduct

savings from a weekly paycheck and then match that money with their own. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#70:1> " These are a very smart idea for anyone," Leonard explains, "

because the money isn't taxed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#71:1> If you earn eighteen thousand dollars a year, and contribute two

thousand dollars to the savings plan, you'll only be taxed f 'lla

sixteen-thousand-dollar income." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#72:1> Many young people avoid these plans because the money is not

supposed to be touched until the age of 591/2, at which time the money is

taxed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#73:1> " But," as Leonard points out, " even if you pay the ten-percent

penalty to withdraw money early, you've still saved a great 'vel over the

years in tax breaks." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#74:1> If Ann Marie 's company doesn't offer a 401(k) plan, Leonard

suggests opening an IRA(Individual Retirement Account).
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#75:1> They are a good way to start long-term savings ( also not to be

touched until retirement), but the money that 's invested isn't always

tax-deductible. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#76:1> Everyone worried about Ann Marie 's tendency to pay bills late,

and suggested she obtain a copy of her credit report ( as of May, anyone can

get one free report annually from TRW, a national credit reporting agency,

800-392-1122).
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#77:1> " Ultimately, she could be hurting her ability to borrow money for a

house," warns Leonard.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#78:1> The only way to fix a bad credit history is to keep a perfect record

for seven years, so the sooner Ann Marie finds out if there 's a problem, the

better. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#79:1> " I love the way she did her homework' and read that money book,"

says White about Maggie Drucker.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#80:1> " She 's frugal," agrees Leonard, " and it helps her."
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#81:1> But even Maggie 's finances could he improved.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#82:1> At

&dollar;1,200 a month, her rent far exceeds the rule that only a quarter of monthly

take-home salary go toward housing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#83:1> " She pays for that rent by never buying clothes," says Leonard. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#84:1> If Maggie 's parents don't greatly need the tax break, Leonard

suggests that she take over her own mortgage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#85:1> " That tax savings would be the money that she 's now having trouble

putting away," she says. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#86:1> But most importantly, Maggie should change the way she has

invested her savings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#87:1> Currently she has

&dollar;8,000 in money market accounts and

&dollar;8,000 divided among three mutual funds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#88:1> " Maggie 's being much too conservative," Leonard says, citing the low

interest most money-market accounts pay.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#89:1> Instead, she recommends Maggie keep only 10 percent of her savings in

money-market accounts.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#90:1> The rest should be in relatively safe mutual funds, and a quarter

should he in a more risky stock fund.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#91:1> " That might be tough for her psychologically, because you have to

ride the ups and downs of the stock market," says Leonard, " but she 's young,

she should be aggresive and steel her heart to do it." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#92:1> For women like Maggie who have some money to invest, the experts

suggest no-load mutual funds, which don't require any fees to join.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#93:1> For information about no-load funds, the experts recommend a highly

readable

&dollar;5 booklet published by Mutual Fund Education Alliance, 1900 Erie Street,

Suite 120, Kansas City, MO64116. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#94:1> Everyone agrees that Melissa Waksman is doing a good job of

paying off a formidable

&dollar;35,000 in student loans, but they also think she could be saving a lot more.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#95:1> Anita Jones-Lee, the author of Women and Money: A Guide for the ' 90s

( Barrolls Educational Series, Inc., 1991) suggests melting some of those

five credit cards she now holds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#96:1> " Ideally, she should just keep one and pay it off every month," she

says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#97:1> " In general, store charge cards are redundant they charge higher

interest rates, and the stores usually take bank credit cards anyway." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#98:1> Melissa should also shop around to make sure she 's getting the

best possible rate on her credit cards.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#99:1> Right now, she 's using one that charges 19-percent interest when she

could find one that charges 12 percent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#100:1> Jones-Lee suggests calling the Bankcard Holders of America,

703-481-1110, a nonprofit organization based in Herndon, Virginia, for a list

of banks and the rates that they charge. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#101:1> Nobody found fault with Melissa for her

&dollar;2,500 Tahitian vacation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#102:1> In fact, they admired her for realizing that she needed it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#103:1> Leonard thought she might cut down on the impulsive weekend trips,

but otherwise the experts found her spending habits to be under control. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#104:1> At least two of the experts compared Sara Franklyn 's

relationship with money to that of a dieter who can't control her eating.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#105:1> Sara is the high earner in the group, but she needs to resolve her

conflicts about discipline and spending.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#106:1> As one expert put it, " If you're mak 're one hundred thousand

dollars a year, you shouldn't be afraid to window-shop." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#107:1> Everyone agreed, however, that Sara 's biggest concern should be

avoiding taxes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#108:1> If she bought a house, as she says she would like to, she could

write off her mortgage interest, but the experts were surprisingly cautious

about real estate as an investment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#109:1> While it 's true that real-estate prices have dropped and interest

rates are low, there 's still no guarantee that your investment will

appreciate in the long run. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#110:1> A far better investment for a self-employed person with a high

income is a Keogh savings plan, where taxes can be deferred until she reaches

591/2 years of age.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#111:1> As a self-employed person, Sara also needs to be especially careful

about putting money aside in case of an emergency.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#112:1> Once again, everyone suggested mutual funds for growth. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#113:1> If telling someone with minimal savings to spend less on eating

out or clothing doesn't sound like a revelation, the financial experts are

the first to admit it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#114:1> The hard part, they say, isn't understanding their advice, but

convincing women to follow it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#115:1> But money isn't always a rational subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#116:1> " Look at Ann Marie," says White.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#117:1> " You would think someone who works as a financial researcher at a

bank would pay the same attention to her personal balance sheet." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#118:1> " Many women act as if real life hasn't really begun, as if what

they're 'reng is just temporary," Leonard says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#119:1> " I realize it 's very difficult in your twenties or early thirties

to think about how your finances will be when you're 'refty-nine, but you will

be that age someday."
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#120:1> And Leonard points out that women on average spend one third more

years in retirement than men, still don't make as much money as men do and

often end up having to take care of themselves. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#121:1> If those facts are dreary, there is a more positive incentive to

begin saving now.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#122:1> Assuming a return of 9 percent, a woman who invests

&dollar;l00 every month starting at the age of 25 will have

&dollar;66,790 by the time she 's 45.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#123:1> A woman who starts saving the same amount every month at 35 wilt

have only

&dollar;19,350 by the same age. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-019#124:1> " It 's as if they feel that by taking charge of money issues,

they' 'readmitting failure, that they won't meet someone or ever have help,"

Leonard says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-019#125:1> Most single young women are betting they 'll get married, and they

probably will, but either way, making financial plans for the future today is

crucial. </p> </I>
