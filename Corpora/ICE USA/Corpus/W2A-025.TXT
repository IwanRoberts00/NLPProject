<ICE-USA:W2A-025#7:1> <h> I. Introduction </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#8:1> Optical velocimetry based on Fabry-Perot interferometers ( FP 's)

operating in the fringe mode is a widely used measuring technique in research

with explosives, gas-propelled projectiles, and electrically accelerated

objects.1 Since Ref.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#9:1> 1 was published, two recent new ideas providing more capability for

this technique have emerged.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#10:1> Gidon and Behar2 have demonstrated an order of magnitude more laser

power by using a pulsed dye laser followed by an FP filter set to the same

spacing as the conventional analyzer FP.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#11:1> The interference patterns for each filtered frequency overlap almost

perfectly at the slit of the streaking camera, effectively making all

nonmonochromatic filtered power useful.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#12:1> In addition, McMillan et al.3 have applied a striped analyzer FP to

use more efficiently the light reflected by a moving test object.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#13:1> In this technique, one removes a narrow stripe of the reflective

coating on the upstream mirror to avoid the large losses ( of the order of

90&percent;) that normally arise from reflection.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#14:1> These two ideas are not without drawbacks, however.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#15:1> The multifrequency technique involves a slight broadening of most of

the interference fringes caused by the imperfect overlap, and the stripe

technique involves the problem of inducing the reflected light to enter the

stripe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#16:1> The latter issue is a function of the size of the illumination on the

target, averaged over the target travel distance, and the solid angle of the

collection optics.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#17:1> Our purpose is to provide a set of fairly simple analytical

formulas for users to compare the total velocity resolution, time resolution,

and photographic writing speed of one striped velocimeter configuration with

another.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#18:1> The major simplification in our approach is the treatment of the

fraction of light reflected by the target that can enter the instrument.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#19:1> We have written a code ( STRIPE) that calculates in detail the amount

of light at each instant of time from a moving Lambertian target that enters

an array of real collection fibers and illuminates the strip on the FP

mirrors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#20:1> To present the results as analytical formulas, however, we do not use

STRIPE here.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#21:1> Instead, we simply calculate the ratio of the emittance ( or

brightness) acceptance of the instrument to the emittance reflected by the

target.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#22:1> This helps to determine, for any optical transport system between the

target and the instrument, an upper limit on the amount of useful light.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#23:1> Work with STRIPE has shown us that it is not difficult for real

systems to collect 30&percent; of the amount of light represented by the

emittance-argument limit.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#24:1> The present work is intended to be useful in comparing various

reflectivities, mirror spacings, and streak-camera properties to see how they

affect the net time and velocity resolutions and the upper limit on the

photographic writing speed for each interference fringe.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#25:1> We derive a simple analytical result for the effect on fringe

finesse of the angular divergence of light entering an FP filter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#26:1> We also derive several properties of striped FP 's.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#27:1> For example, we present a good simple analytical approximation for

the total finesse of a striped FP with finite-sized nonflat mirrors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#28:1> An explanation of some of the properties of normal as well as striped

FP 's with regard to energy flow is given.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#29:1> It is shown below that diffraction plays a key role in understanding

energy transport in the striped FP, even for light beams several centimeters

in diameter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#30:1> Figure 1 shows the system being modeled.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#31:1> A dye-pumped laser oscillator beam2 is expanded by a telescope to

reduce angular divergence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#32:1> It then enters an FP filter and is transported to the target,

reflected, and collected by a lens.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#33:1> This light is then converged in one dimension by a cylindrical lens

and enters an analyzer FP with a stripe of its reflective coating removed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#34:1> The exiting light is focused by a spherical lens onto the slit of an

electronic streak camera.</p> <&> [ FIGURE 1 OMITTED]</&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#38:1> The upstream mirror of intensity reflectivity <it> R </it> 1 has

a stripe of half-width <it> R </it> st removed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#39:1> The length of the stripe equals the mirror diameter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#40:1> The entire downstream mirror is coated with reflectivity <it> R </it>

2.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#41:1> We first consider only light incident at a large enough angle that

multiple reflection occurs, as indicated in Fig. 2 [ OMITTED]</&>.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#42:1> It is straightforward, by using the standard formalism illustrated

for normal FP 's in Ref. 4, to calculate the intensity at the focal plane of a

spherical lens vs incident angle for perfectly flat mirrors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#43:1> The sum of the transmitted beamlet amplitudes is [ equation] ( 1)

where the phase <foreign> d </foreign> is given by [ equation] ( 2) <it> h

</it> is the mirror separation, <it> v </it> is the frequency, and <it> c

</it> is the speed of light. Here <it> r </it> 1 and <it> r </it> 2 are the

amplitude reflectivities of the two dielectric coatings, and <it> t </it> 2

is the amplitude transmission of the second coating.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#44:1> The ratio of transmitted to incident intensities is [ equation] where

the reflectivity <it> R </it> is given by [ equation] [ equation]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#45:1> The coefficient <it> A </it> is typically ~0.002 and accounts for

absorption and scattering Peaks in the transmission multiple of 2<foreign> p

</foreign> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#46:1> In this paper, this peaks are due to variations in either frequency

or angle.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#47:1> If we set <it> R </it> 1= <it> R </it> 2 = <it> R </it> in Eqs.(4)

and ( 5), Eq.(3) agrees with expression ( 5.3.1) given in the text by

Hernandez for a side-illuminated FP.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#48:1> A striped FP allows one to see fringes on both sides of the center of

the pattern, as opposed to the side-illuminated FP.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#49:1> As pointed out in Ref. 1, the analysis of the pattern is much easier

if fringes on both sides of 0º are available.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#50:1> The resonant angles <foreign> O </foreign> j of Eq. ( 3) are [

equation] where int means the integer part of, <foreign> X </foreign> is the

wavelength, <it> k </it> is a positive integer ( usually less than 5), and

<it> j </it> is given by [ equation]
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#51:1> Here <it> e </it> is the fractional order of interference and has a

value between 0 and 1.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#52:1> The index <it> j </it> is a real number.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#53:1> This notation is shown in Fig. 3.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#54:1> Our <it> k </it> - 1 is the <it> j </it> of Ref. 1.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#55:1> The second form of Eq.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#56:1> ( 6) is a good approximation to the resonant angles, since they are

usually smaller than 0.01 rad.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#57:1> The ratio of the separation of the transmission peaks to their

full width at half-maximum ( FWHM), when the phase, or the product <it> v

</it> cos <foreign> O </foreign> , is varied, is called the finesse and is

given by [ equation] the latter form being the limit for large <it> R </it> ,

which is accurate to 0.1&percent; for <it> R </it> greater than 0.86.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#58:1> If <it> R </it> 1 =1, the transmission of the striped FP can be

written as

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#59:1> [ equation]</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#60:1> For a given finesse, and thus for a given value of <it> R </it> ,

it will often be best to have <it> R </it> 1 = 1, since this produces about

twice the peak intensity compared with <it> R </it> 1 <it> R </it> 2 = <it> R

</it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#61:1> For example, Eqs. ( 3) and ( 9) show that a pair of 99.8 and 92.3&percent;

reflectivity mirrors with <it> A </it> = 0.002 transmit ~1.95 times at much

light as a pair of 96&percent; mirrors, but both have the same finesse or velocity

resolution.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#62:1> The reason is that with <it> R </it> 1= 1, almost all the energy must

exit to the right of the mirror pair.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#63:1> The advantage in doing this was not recognized in Ref. 3.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#64:1> An advantage of the stripe over the normal FP is shown by

comparing Eq. ( 9) with the result for the normal FP: [ equation] where <it>

R </it> is the reflectivity common to both mirrors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#65:1> For incident light that enters the stripe, when <it> R </it> 1 =

0.998, <it> R </it> 2 = 0.923, and <it> A </it> = 0.002, the peak intensity

for the striped FP is 51 times as large as that for the normal FP with <it> R

</it> = 0.96 and the same finesse.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#66:1> In most cases, part of this transmission advantage is canceled

because only a fraction of the illumination can be made to enter the stripe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#67:1> The stripe technique will be advantageous when the product of the

illumination size on the target and the angular range of the collected light

are small enough.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#68:1> Comparing Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) shows that the absorption A decreases

the peak transmission of the normal FP by a large percentage than it does for

the striped FP with <it> R </it> 1 = 1.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#69:1> For <it> A </it> = 0.002 and <it> R </it> = 0.97, absorption

decreases the normal FP peak transmission by 18&percent; but drops the striped FP

transmission by less than 4&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#70:1> This can be understood qualitatively by considering just a single

beam traversing the first mirror of the normal FP.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#71:1> Then absorption makes the first transmitted intensity equal to 0.028,

rather than 0.030, for a 7&percent; loss in output.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#72:1> The averages over phase from 0 to 2p - that is, over one free

spectral range- are important for the discussions below.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#73:1> They are [ equation] for the striped FP with <it> R </it> 1 = 1 and [

equation] for the normal FP pattern.</p> <h> B. Equal Reflectivity Mirrors

for the Striped Fabry-Perot Interferometer </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#74:1> Another mode of operation for the striped FP is to use equal

reflectivity mirrors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#75:1> One can compensate for the factor of 2 in peak transmission mentioned

just after Eq. ( 9) for the light that enters the stripe by using some of the

light that cannot enter the stripe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#76:1> We normally set the angular divergence approaching the stripe just to

cover four transmission peaks.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#77:1> Suppose that under this constraint the illumination cannot be made

smaller than 25 times as large as the stripe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#78:1> Then, for the example above for <it> R </it> = 0.96, the transmitted

intensity is about the same regardless of whether <it> R </it> 1 = 1.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#79:1> One problem with this mode of operation, however, is that, if any

light missing the stripe is converging toward the optical axis, some of the

multiply reflected beams may eventually exit back through the stripe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#80:1> This creates a fringe broadening owing to the limited number of

beamlets created.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#81:1> For example, if the full width of the stripe were 0.7 mm, and the

illumination 18 mm wide ( so that the intensity would be equivalent), the

mirrors would effectively be only 9 mm in radius for such rays.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#82:1> For 9-mm radius mirrors with <it> h </it> = 6.5 cm and <it> R

</it> = 0.96, one finds that, using Subsection IV.E on walkoff broadening for

these special rays, walkoff would degrade the finesse from 76 to 17.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#83:1> One might try to set up the illumination at the stripe so that

the light diverges away from the optical axis, and reflection back through

the stripe cannot occur.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#84:1> This could be ensured by using fiber-optic transport between the

reflecting target and the optics just preceding the stripe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#85:1> Thus, when the reflecting target moves, the light entering the stripe

would not change from divergence to convergence, as it could for an

air-transport system.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#86:1> To ensure divergence, one would set the waist of the illumination

upstream of the stripe.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#87:1> The rays at the waist of spatially incoherent illumination usually

have an angular distribution that is not significantly correlated with the

radius of the ray.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#88:1> It is easy to show that the illumination at the stripe must be at

least twice the diameter of the waist to eliminate convergence

completely.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#89:1> Unfortunately, the angles of the rays entering the first mirror

would then have a correlation with position with the large radii

corresponding to large angles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#90:1> If the illumination has a radius of 9 mm to match the transmitted

power of an FP with <it> R </it> 1 = 1, the outer rays hitting a 25-mm radius

mirror walk less distance before vignetting.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#91:1> These rays would have a larger walk-off broadening than would an FP

with <it> R </it> 1 = 1.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#92:1> Thus, unless the mirrors are large enough, attempting to obtain more

power transmission by using equal reflectivity mirrors necessitates broader

fringes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-025#93:1> There is one situation with an equal reflectivity FP that should

be avoided experimentally.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#94:1> Suppose the position of the illumination waist near the stripe is

allowed to move during the dynamic experiment, as would happen with an

air-transport system.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#95:1> The system 's velocity resolution would be tested with a static target

( static waist position) for which we assume that all the rays diverge into

the FP.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#96:1> Then, if the waist size is only a few millimeters, the walkoff

broadening is minimal and the fringe sharpness appears to be good.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#97:1> During the dynamic motion of the target, however, the position of the

waist may move toward the striped FP and allow converging rays to enter the

nonstriped region.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#98:1> Then reflections back through the stripe will occur and make the

fringes significantly broader than they were compared with the initial

test.</p> p><ICE-USA:W2A-025#>In summary, if the mirrors are large enough, there may be

situations where more intensity at no loss of velocity resolution results

from using equal reflectivities.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#99:1> But for our applications this is unlikely, because it is usually

possible to make the waist radius only a few millimeters.
<ICE-USA:W2A-025#100:1> Also, if the waist is this small, no significant broadening will

occur with equal reflectivities if divergence of the rays is ensured, but

more transmitted power would result from using <it> R </it> 1 = 1.</p> </I>
