<I>
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#1:1> <h> THE LITTLE BOY NOBODY WANTED</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#2:1> Was Tommy really such a bad boy that his mother had to reject him?
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#3:1> I decided to find out--and what I learned will break your heart.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#4:1> March 8, 1990.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#5:1> Low-hanging dark clouds roar across Lake Michigan bringing bleakness

and rain to Chicago.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#6:1> Inside a sterile steel and glass building on the near West Side, an

equally bleak scene is playing out.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#7:1> Tommy, a small, skinny kid with tousled brown hair and green eyes,

stands beneath an imposing bench, staring up at an equally imposing judge in

black robes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#8:1> Surrounding Tommy are an assistant state 's attorney, an assistant

public guardian appointed to act as the boy 's lawyer, his parents, and their

lawyer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#9:1> Tommy bites his lip as he tries to fight back tears.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#10:1> Within minutes, the parents who had adopted him six years previously

will no longer be his parents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#11:1> " Mr. and Mrs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#12:1> Johnson," the judge begins, " I have been advised that at this time

you wish to sign a document that is entitled ` final and irrevocable consent

to an adoption.' Is that correct?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#13:1> " Yes," the Johnsons respond.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#14:1> " Do you each understand that by signing this document you are

giving up any and all parental rights to Thomas?" the judge asks slowly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#15:1> In reply, the Johnsons grab a pen and quickly sign the

document.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#16:1> Tommy 's lawyer asks the judge if the boy can talk to him.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#17:1> Eleven-year-old Tommy has an eight-year-old brother, Rick, still at

home with the Johnsons, she says.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#18:1> Tommy loves his brother and wants to maintain a relationship with

him.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#19:1> But the judge refuses to talk to the boy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#20:1> The lawyer pleads that the judge order the Johnsons to permit

visitation between their ex-son and their present son.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#21:1> But the judge refuses, saying that any such order would be "

unenforceable."
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#22:1> Case dismissed...</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#23:1> The lawyer who represented Tommy that day works for me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#24:1> I'm the Public Gu 'mdian of Cook County, which comprises Chicago and

its suburbs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#25:1> Some 115 people, including 55 lawyers, work for my office: Our job is

to try to protect those who are least able to protect themselves--generally

the elderly and the children.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#26:1> As the legal protectors of neglected and abused children in the

Juvenile Court of Cook County, we see a lot of horror stories.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#27:1> But few have affected me as much as Tommy 's.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#28:1> When my lawyer told me about him, my first reaction was to cry.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#29:1> My second was to slug the judge for not ordering visits between Tommy

and his brother.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#30:1> My third was to do--well, something to the Johnsons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#31:1> What I did was to immediately take over Tommy 's case.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#32:1> At first, I figured that something had to be very wrong with him for

his parents to have given him up this way.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#33:1> So I checked into his background--the psychological reports,

social-work reports, and school reports that cataloged the eleven years of

his life...</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#34:1> Tommy and Rick were adopted by Pamela and Joseph Johnson when

Tommy was five and Rick, three.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#35:1> Before that, the boys' background had been chaotic.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#36:1> Sarah, their biological mother, came from an abusive family.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#37:1> Though neither she nor the boys' father physically or sexually abused

Tommy and Rick, the father seems to have disappeared early or been home only

sporadically.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#38:1> Sarah and the boys lived on welfare in one room in a poor

neighborhood on Chicago 's Northwest Side.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#39:1> At times, her father, Tommy and Rick 's grandfather, lived with

them--when he was not in jail.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#40:1> Tommy and Rick grew up on candy, soda pop, and potato chips, while

their mother lived on cigarettes and drugs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#41:1> Finally, Sarah simply decided she couldn't deal with the boys any

more and gave them up.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#42:1> In August 1984, the Johnsons adopted them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#43:1> Then in their mid-thirties, the Johnsons were a successful

middle-class couple.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#44:1> They each owned their won business, as well as cars, a house, a

camper and campsite.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#45:1> But, according to a psychologist who saw the boys and the Johnsons

regularly, " problems in Tommy 's placement were evident from the

beginning."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#46:1> The psychologist observed that, " the Johnsons-- particularly

Mrs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#47:1> Johnson--demonstrated ongoing difficulty in hearing and acknowledging

viewpoints which differ from their own."
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#48:1> He characterized the Johnsons' parenting style as " quite

rule-oriented and rigid with little encouragement for independent thinking,

discussion, and day-to-day problem solving." He suggested that the Johnsons

should become more responsive and flexible in responding to Tommy 's needs; he

consistently called their attention to their preferential treatment of

Rick--a more passive and affectionate child--but they could not, or would

not, modify their parenting approach.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#49:1> When Tommy did not behave as the Johnsons demanded, when he

didn't fulfill their expectations, they called him untrustworthy, and

increasingly withdrew their emotional support.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#50:1> Then, although Tommy had done generally well in school, he was, at

Mrs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#51:1> Johnson 's " repeated insistence," placed in a school for behaviorally

disordered children.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#52:1> Through it all, Tommy and Rick grew closer than ever: The year

after their adoption, the therapist noted that Rick idolized his older

brother.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#53:1> Imperfect as home life with the Johnsons was, there was some

element of stability in it for Tommy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#54:1> For more than five years he was part of their family, one of their

sons.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#55:1> Then, as he told me, " One night when I was eating dinner, my mom and

dad were talking about me, and they said they were going to put me up for

adoption.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#56:1> I thought they were kidding.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#57:1> But they weren't! I was crying, and then they asked my brother is he

going to miss me?
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#58:1> And he said, yeah, he 's going to miss all the fun he had with

me.."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#59:1> Ironically, it was the day before Thanksgiving 1989 when the

Johnsons dropped off their son at Hephzibah, an orphanage in Oak Park, Ill.,

and left him there with not even a backward glance.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#60:1> How did Tommy feel?
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#61:1> I guess the answer is obvious.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#62:1> He cried himself to sleep for many long dark nights.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#63:1> On Christmas Eve he and a friend made a tape.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#64:1> In it, Tommy expressed his feelings, but perhaps his friend said it

better: " When I heard that he[Tommy] was going to be [ put in the

orphanage], I started to cry.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#65:1> I said, well buddy, I'm sorry 'm
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#66:1> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#67:1> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#68:1> but I guess this is what life is about.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#69:1> A couple of nights I was so sad and so mad that I cried and cried and

cried when I went to bed."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#70:1> Tommy made the tape for the Johnsons--but they refused to even

listen to it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#71:1> And two and a half months later, in March 1990, they returned Tommy,

like a piece of defective merchandise, back to the court, severing all

connection with him.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#72:1> Within days of the Johnsons' giving Tommy up, my department sued

them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#73:1> We asked the court to order them to permit Tommy to visit and phone

his brother.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#74:1> The Johnsons argued that the court had no jurisdiction to impose a

family situation on them when Tommy was no longer family.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#75:1> We countered that brother and sisters had an absolute constitutional

right to each other 's company, which even a parent had no right to sever.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#76:1> Motions, memoranda, and squabbles went on before three separate

judges.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#77:1> The Johnsons filed legal papers arguing that it was unsafe for

Rick to be around Tommy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#78:1> Tommy, they said, had tried to drown Rick while swimming.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#79:1> Tommy had hit Rick on the head with a baseball bat.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#80:1> Tommy was psychotic; he was in a class for behaviorally disordered

boys.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#81:1> I investigated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#82:1> Yes, I learned that Tommy <it> had </it> hit Rick with a baseball

bat.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#83:1> A plastic bat.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#84:1> My disgust with the Johnsons knew no bounds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#85:1> I happen to know about plastic bats.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#86:1> My own kids, ages eight and five, use them as swords all the

time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#87:1> The " drowning" incident?
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#88:1> Tommy had dunked Rick, I found out.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#89:1> I wish I had a nickel for every time, growing up, one of my five

brothers tried to dunk me, or I one of them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#90:1> Simple boys' horseplay is all it is.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#91:1> Was Tommy psychotic?
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#92:1> Every psychiatrist and psychologist who saw him affirmed that he was

a healthy child, not emotionally disturbed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#93:1> His presence in a special education class?
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#94:1> " He didn't belong here," the special- education school social worker

told me flatly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#95:1> It was only pressure from Mrs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#96:1> Johnson that put Tommy in the class.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#97:1> In fact, soon after he was placed at the orphanage, Tommy was back at

a regular school--"a delightful and regular boy," according to the director

of Hephzibah.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#98:1> As his lawyer, I got to know Tommy well.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#99:1> I took him to a Wendy 's.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#100:1> We went for walks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#101:1> We talked about life with his family.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#102:1> " I want to go back to live with them," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#103:1> " Why?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#104:1> " Because my brother 's there.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#105:1> If I had been a better boy, if I had listened to my parents, I

wouldn't be in this fix."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#106:1> I tried to reassure him that all little boys sometimes don't

listen to their mothers and fathers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#107:1> He would have none of it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#108:1> All little boys, he pointed out, weren't turned in to orphanages.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#109:1> All little boys hadn't been abandoned by two sets of parents by the

time they were eleven years old.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#110:1> My heart broke for him.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#111:1> I told him he was wrong--he was, and is, a good kid.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#112:1> I told him I would try to help him visit with his brother.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#113:1> A couple of weeks later I took him swimming with my two boys.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#114:1> On another occasion he stayed with us for the weekend.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#115:1> My kids love him.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#116:1> He 's a joy to be around.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#117:1> As outraged as I am about what happened to Tommy, I know that

his situation is not unique.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#118:1> The sad fact is that more and more adoptive families are turning

their kids back in.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#119:1> According to the Child Welfare League of America, some 13 percent of

all adopted children were returned to state officials in 1989.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#120:1> Among children who are older, or who have physical or emotional

problems, the percentage runs closer to 25 percent.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#121:1> Just in the last couple of months, in my bailiwick, two

middle-class families turned in their kids at juvenile court.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#122:1> In one case, the parents, a physician and his wife, fought over the

car, the house, and the record collection when they divorced.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#123:1> But when it came to their adopted child, they simply dropped him off

at the juvenile court and walked away.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#124:1> In the second case, the kid was close to his adoptive father--who

died.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#125:1> At that point, his mother dumped him and fled our jurisdiction.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#126:1> But let 's not just point the finger at adoptive parents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#127:1> I also know firsthand that natural parents are not exempt.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#128:1> I can't tell you the number of middle-class couples I 've seen in my

professional capacity who keep their kids, but emotionally walk away from

them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#129:1> Careers take precedence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#130:1> Both parents work late.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#131:1> After-work business drinks or dinners are more important than

family.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#132:1> And the kids? Well, they 've got to learn to be independent someday,

don't they?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#133:1> I don't mean to imply that every parent or even most, are bad.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#134:1> There are wonderful parents out there.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#135:1> And some of them adopt kids--and love them and commit to them and

stand by them for life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#136:1> My only wish is that two such people had found Tommy...</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#137:1> There was some good news for him: We won our case.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#138:1> The judge reversed himself and ordered the Johnsons to provide Tommy

and Rick with weekly visits and nightly phone calls under the supervision of

Hephzibah.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#139:1> So Tommy and Rick do see each other, and both are better off because

of it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#140:1> The court also ordered the responsible state agency to find a new

adoptive home for Tommy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#141:1> One day after the battle for visitation with Rick was all over,

I took Tommy for a power lunch at McDonalds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#142:1> Afterward we went for a walk.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#143:1> He wanted to climb a tree and I boosted him up.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#144:1> Later, I asked him the question that had by this time become a

routine for us: " Now, what do lawyers do for their clients?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#145:1> Tommy always pretended that he didn't know what lawyers do.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#146:1> On this occasion, though, he looked at me, his eyes dancing with

mischief, and replied, " Ah, of course I know.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#147:1> They buy them cheeseburgers, fries, and a chocolate shake, and climb

trees with clients."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#148:1> In his humor, Tommy probably told me more about what I like

about being a lawyer than I had inferred in the quarter-century I 've been

practicing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#149:1> He also, I thought, told me something about himself.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#150:1> There is more, of course, I could not expect a child who was

cruelly abandoned not once but twice to escape unharmed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#151:1> So later I was sad, but not surprised, to learn that Tommy began

having emotional problems.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-018#152:1> He is receiving help from them, though, and I hope--and

Believe--he will make it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-018#153:1> Tommy is only eleven; he deserves a better chance at life.</p> </I>
