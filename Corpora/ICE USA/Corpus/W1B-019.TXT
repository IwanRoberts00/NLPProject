<I>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#1:1> <@> Sally</@>, I've gone over your 'vest two chapters and I wanted

to get back to you quickly to give you some general feedback.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#2:1> If you need a model, use the 4th edition of Linguistics for

Non-Linguists, which is now out.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#3:1> Your manuscript will be published as a 6 x 9 book, so you'll need to
 'llut it in a single-column format ( double columns will be too narrow and will

make it difficult to integrate figures).
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#4:1> <@> Robert</@> will working with the files on a PC platform ( Word

2003, Windows XP), so your files will need to be compatible with that.<p><ICE-USA:W1B-019#>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#5:1> 4On pp. 3-4, you get into the " nature vs. nurture" argument

concerning language acquisition.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#6:1> Your point is clear to someone who is already familiar with it, but

might be missed by novices.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#7:1> Why not put it in point form, like we do in LNL? E.g., uniformity

within species, rapidity of acquisition, language universals, independent of

instruction, intelligence, and motivation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#8:1> When you're different 'reing two categories as in Sections 2.1-2.3,

use examples that differentiate just two categories.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#9:1> You're fine in s 'reion 2.1 ( Ns vs. Ds), but the examples become

unnecessarily complicated in 2.2 ( Vs vs. Is).
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#10:1> I like the sections on the " tests" for differentiating categories (

sections 2.4-2.6), but you seem to be letting the " theory " ( i.e.,

picturing, pointing, and linking) overpower the tests themselves.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#11:1> Keep in mind that your readers ( including many of the instructors

who pick up your book) are novices, and their initial concern is

understanding the tests and how to apply them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#12:1> Later on they may ( or may not) get to a point where they

appreciate the theory.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#13:1> In other words, don't let the diagram on p. 15 overpower your

presentation; what the reader wants is the summary in section 2.7.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#14:1> ( By the way, your summary on p. 19 would be enhanced immensely if

you were to include a brief example with each test.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#15:1> For examples of what I'm talking about 'msee the chapter summaries in

the binders from our last meeting in Dallas.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#16:1> In short, here is the acid test when you're writing: 'reld

someone with average intelligence, but not a linguist ( like your corner

store grocer, be able to read the text and do the exercises without the help

of someone who knows the subject?
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#17:1> That 's who you're writing 're.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#18:1> All in all I like this book and I like your approach.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#19:1> It 's going to be a good product.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#20:1> My goal is to get you on track early in the process to minimize your

work when we get to the editing stage.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#21:1> I'm going to 'mve to set your ms. aside for a while now, so I can get

back to work and have our report ready to go into print by early ' 05.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#22:1> <h> Good luck, <@> Phoebe</@> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#23:1> Dear <@> Jodie</@> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#24:1> I think your proposal for a book on wordplay actually sounds

extremely interesting ( your protestations to the contrary notwithstanding).
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#25:1> I also think you are right to pitch the book at a general audience of

English language lovers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#26:1> As such, the emphasis will have to be on the examples rather than on

the theory that accounts for the examples.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#27:1> ( This is not to say that theory should be excluded; but rather than

only the theory necessary for grasping a particular example should be

included.) In short, the book will have to be " fun" to read ( and I think it

will be, based on the examples in the proposal), and it will have to be

accessible to both " soft" linguists and non-linguists in academe, as well as

a general audience bf English language lovers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#28:1> I also think that the " applications" you mention to law,

business, etc.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#29:1> have a lot of potential, including the applications to advertising.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#30:1> In fact, it may be that the best organization for the book will be by

area of application rather than by area level of linguistic description (

i.e., phonology, syntax, morphology, etc.).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#31:1> Please send me, one of the chapters you already have written.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#32:1> I would prefer to see one of your best chapters other than ( or in

addition to) the introduction.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#33:1> You can mail it to me at the address below, or email it to me.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#34:1> PS: If you sign a publication contract with Paddington Press I

can assure you that you will be able to use your ideas in ancillary

materials, such as a workbook or seminar presentations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#35:1> All that we would ask is that Genentech receives the right of first

refusal to publish such materials ourselves.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#36:1> Best,</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#37:1> <h> <@> Gabriel Jones</@> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#38:1> Dear <@> Sal</@>,</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#39:1> Great to hear from you.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#40:1> I like your idea about a children 's book very much, and I like

the idea of the illustrations, too.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#41:1> As you know, this is outside my area, but I believe in the appeal of

the ? Monkey and Kitty? story and I have faith in your ability as a writer of

such stories.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#42:1> In short, I am eager to publish your work if you'd be wi 'ding to help

me with the marketing, i.e., mailing lists, distributors, etc.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#43:1> ( I market primarily by direct mail, using membership lists from

professional organizations.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#44:1> I also maintain a website, and I'm plannin 'mon advertising in

professional journals beginning this year.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#45:1> My own instinct is that Mr. Biggelsworth is a " young person 's"

novel, and would combine well with something like line drawings.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#46:1> Why don't you show your illustrator the " Daredevil Bassett Hound"

story and see if she would like to illustrate it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#47:1> If so, maybe you could send me a sample of her work " Captain Canary"

or something else she 's done).
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#48:1> You will have to decide the best way to compensate the illustrator--a

cut of the royalties or an up-front fee with no royalties ( we both need to

think about this).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#49:1> The snow has melted and we're rid 're outside now.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#50:1> 'In fact, this week is spring break and we have our horses down at

our farm in Woodstock about 50 miles south of Albany</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#51:1> Hope to hear from you soon.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#52:1> ( You can send stuff via email, or by regular mail to the address

below.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#53:1> PS: Please send me the " Adventures of Rocky Raccoon" story,

too!</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#54:1> <h> Sincerely,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#55:1> <h> <@> Jada Black</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#56:1> <h> Dear <@> Janet</@>, </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#57:1> Let me try to answer your questions one at a time. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#58:1> We require that the book be copyrighted by Congress.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#59:1> This is a condition of publication and is the standard in the

industry.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#60:1> ( Keep in mind that if the book goes out of print, the contract

requires us to return all rights to you.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#61:1> The website to promote your book is an excellent idea; so is

promoting it at professional conferences.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#62:1> We would, however, like you to submit the " brief excerpts" you

mention for our review before you include hem on your website. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#63:1> The form of the instructor 's manual would depend on the specific

exercises and assignments you end up including in the book itself.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#64:1> We generally think of an IM as an " answer key." However, with

open-ended exercises/assignments, we like to give instructors at least a

general sense of what each one is designed to elicit from the student.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#65:1> We would ask you to start working on the IM once the final copy of

the textbook is approved for publication.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#66:1> That way you can have it ready upon ( or shortly after) publication

of your book.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#67:1> The IM will be photocopied and provided to instructors who adopt your

book. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#68:1> You will definitely have an opportunity to review the final copy

of the manuscript as well as page proofs.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#69:1> You will also have opportunity for input on the title and cover

design.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#70:1> We want you to be happy with the final product. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#71:1> I hope this answers your questions, but let me know if you have

other concerns. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#72:1> <h> Sincerely,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#73:1> <h> <@> Jack Robertson</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#74:1> Thank you for taking the time to respond to the reviewer 's

evaluation of your manuscript. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#75:1> Since forwarding the first reviewer 's comments to you, I have

consulted with two other readers, who concur with the first: the point of

many of the readings is unclear, and the relationship of the readings to the

writing assignments in often confusing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#76:1> Moreover, according to both readers, there would be little market for

a reader of this type in a linguistics course, so the book would have to be

pitched at instructors of a generic writing course.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#77:1> I realize that these are not the kind of reviews you were

anticipating; but if such criticism is not dealt with seriously before

publication, you can be certain it will appear in published reviews

afterward. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#78:1> In light of the reader responses, it is clear that the manuscript

as it stands is not ready for publication by Waldorf Press.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#79:1> Moreover, after considering your response to the first reader 's

comments, it is equally clear that you don't agree with the type or extent of

revisions called for by the first reviewer.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#80:1> Even if you were to make all the changes the first reviewer suggests,

I'm 'mraid it would make the book inconsistent with your vision of it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#81:1> And I, as a publisher, would not feel comfortable pushing you to

compromise your work this way. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#82:1> Furthermore, I am hesitant to undertake further work on this

project by way of a major rewriting on your part or costly re-editing on

Waldorf 's part when there is still no certainty that you will be able to get

permission to use these readings and that they won't be cost-prohibitive.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#83:1>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#84:1> Since our publishing agreement technically expired on last

Thursday ( when the cameraready copy, including manuscript, index, and

instructor 's manual, was due, along with the permissions), I believe the best

course of action is for you to pursue another publisher or a less formal

publishing outlet for your manuscript.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#85:1> Assuming you could get permissions, options you might explore would

include publishing your course materials ( 1) with a local copy service, ( 2)

directly on the Web, or ( 3) with a book distributor, who will print your

materials, warehouse your inventory, and sell them, all for a fee.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#86:1> ( One such company is Johnsons Storage; they have a site at

http://www.johnsonsbighouse.com).
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#87:1> In any event, I am returning by mail your original submission and the

diskettes that you sent. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#88:1> I wish you success in your endeavor. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#89:1> <h> Sincerely,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#100:1> Dear <@> Iris Howard</@>,</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#101:1> I have received responses from two reviewers of your prospectus

and sample chapter for Technical Writing made Easy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#102:1> Although they like the concept of the work ( a writing text aimed

beginning audiences), they have reservations about whether or not the book

would go beyond basic principles of technical writing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#103:1> In particular, they note that the book would have to include the

following features, which are not apparent from the proposal or the 5-page

sample chapter: Examples of writing for any/all of the beginning audiences in

question; Exercises that require the student to produce or analyze writing

for the various UMW* audiences.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#104:1> ( Adding examples and exercises would double chapter 1, which is now

too short, from 5 to 10 pages); Discussion of genres appropriate for each

audience ( i.e., from brochures for patients to grant proposals for the NSF);

Discussion of the legal issues and responsibilities that attend to written

documents in the technical writing field; Discussion of online medical

information, especially for patients.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#105:1>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#106:1> In addition, one reviewer suggests that you restrict the

audiences that you discuss to patients, practitioners, and administrators.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#107:1> ( Writing for researchers brings up a lot of issues not peculiar to

technical writing; also, lots of books are available that handle this topic.)

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#108:1> I realize that our conception of the book may differ from yours.
<ICE-USA:W1B-019#109:1> However, if you would like us to consider your proposal further, you

will need to submit chapters 1 and 2, revised to reflect attention to the

concerns enumerated above.

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-019#110:1> If you want to revise and re-submit, you may send your materials

via email to Bill Balou by surface mail or courier service to the address

below.</p>
