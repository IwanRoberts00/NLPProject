<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#1:1> A Hilo attorney says the Navy could be just months away from

deploying the low frequency sonar system it tested off the Big Island in

1998.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#2:1> Lanny Sinkin said the authorization of the Surveillance Towed

Array Sensor System Low Frequency Active Sonar ( SURTASS LFA) is a serious

threat to the health of marine mammals, particularly whales.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#3:1> The Navy has asked the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS)

for letters of authorization under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and a

permit under the Endangered Species Act.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#4:1> These permits would allow the Navy to " harass" animals protected

under the laws.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#5:1> The NMFS will conduct a hearing Saturday in Honolulu on the

proposed five - year permit, that would allow the Navy to deploy the system

worldwide.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#6:1> Joe Johnson, Navy representative and program manager for the

SURTASS LFA EIS program, did not return a telephone message from West Hawaii

Today.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#7:1> The NMFS has proposed language and given until May 18 for comment

from the public.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#8:1> Sinkin said the rule adopts the Navy 's position that the new sonar is

not harmful to marine mammals, particularly because its volume will be

limited in particularly sensitive areas.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#9:1> But Sinkin, who called SURTASS LFA a relic of the " Cold War,"

said the Navy has dismissed or ignored evidence presented by those who

observed the 1998 experiments off the Kona and Kohala Coast as "

anecdotal."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#10:1> " Numerous whale watch captains said the whales were leaving the

test area as soon as the broadcast began," Sinkin said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#11:1> " Their scientists use anecdotal like it means 'no credibility,'"

he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#12:1> " But what we presented were observations from people who have a

cumulative 125 years of experience on the ocean and they said the whales

fled."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#13:1> Despite what he described as new technology to replace the 1980s

- era SURTASS LFA, Sinkin said the Navy will not give up the project because

it has already invested

&dollar;400 million.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#14:1> " So it will be up to Congress," Sinkin said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#15:1> " It 's just to dangerous to deploy."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#16:1> A lawsuit filed in 1998 by the Hawaii Green Party attempted to

stop the experiment based upon the reports from whale boat captains and other

observers, a snorkeler who said she was injured by the sonar and failure of

the NMFS to stop the experiment despite what it described as permit

violations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#17:1> The lawsuit was dismissed as moot by Judge Alan Kay when the Navy

stopped the testing and said it would conduct no other tests.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#18:1> But Sinkin said the NMFS based its decision on the findings of an

environmental impact statement, which he said omits the court claims and

fails to identify alternatives to deployment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#19:1> " An EIS is supposed to be comprehensive and honest, so a

decision maker can ask, 'do I want 'do be responsible for inflicting this much

environmental damage?'" he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#20:1> " As it is, this decision maker doesn't see impacts or alternatives,

and so he is making a decision in the dark."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#21:1> Sinkin said deployment is so close the Navy already has

commissioned one ship to carry the SURTASS LFA equipment and is in the

process of building three others for the same purpose.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#22:1> Public testimony may be presented at the 1 p.m. meeting at the

Mariott Waikiki Beach Hotel in Honolulu, or mailed by May 18 to Donna

Wieting, Marine Mammal Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources,

<ICE-USA:W2C-017#23:2> <h> Mixed feelings from teachers before vote</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#24:2> Big Island teachers left their picket lines and headed to the

polls Tuesday afternoon to vote on an agreement between the state and the

Hawaii State Teachers Association. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#25:2> Hundreds of teachers from 10 West Hawaii schools gathered at the

Church of Latter - Day Saints hall in Kailua - Kona to review the proposal

before casting their votes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#26:2> HSTA and state officials announced the end of the strike, which

resulted in 14 days of lost educational instruction, late Monday.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#27:2> The strike ended just hours before a federal judge could have

intervened and appointed a receiver to take over the school system. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#28:2> Teachers are expected to return to school this morning, with

classes slated to resume Thursday. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#29:2> Reaction to the contract agreement was mixed and many teachers

leaving the hall refrained from answering questions, while others refused to

provide their names. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#30:2> " I voted to ratify it," said one teacher who asked to remain

anonymous.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#31:2> " I think if we didn't the public would tear our throats out.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#32:2> But I feel bad for the senior teachers, they got shortchanged again.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#33:2> There are no two ways about it."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#34:2> Several teachers noted the contract did not include provisions

for retroactive pay.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#35:2> " It ( the state 's offer) is fair," said Brian Boshard, Kealakehe

Intermediate School teacher.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#36:2> However, he added, the lack of retroactive salary is obviously not

what the teachers wanted.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#37:2> " I voted my heart," Boshard said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#38:2> " I'm a public 'mhool teacher.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#39:2> I would be working without a raise anyway - it 's my calling.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#40:2> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#41:2> During a nearly two - hour discussion prior to the vote, HSTA

Kona Chapter President Bob Hurley fielded questions and reviewed salary

schedules. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#42:2> " I don't think teachers felt pressured about anything," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#43:2> " They just had to figure out what was their personal choice given

the reality."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#44:2> Hurley said it was difficult to determine how the majority felt,

but noted many expressed anger regarding the lack of retroactive pay.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#45:2> " It was a disappointment because ( Cayetano) would not negotiate

any retroactive pay," Hurley said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#46:2> " He refused to budge.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#47:2> He didn't pay anyone over a two - year period and then we couldn't

negotiate that."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#48:2> Not all teachers voted to ratify the contract.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#49:2> " My feeling is it 's an ethical issue.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#50:2> We've got 'vehing added for cost of living for the past two years,"

one teacher who asked to remain anonymous said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#51:2> Hurley said many teachers already have plans to leave Hawaii for

employment opportunities elsewhere, regardless of the vote results. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#52:2> " If it is approved, teachers will have a salary schedule that

functions like step increases," Hurley said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#53:2> " It does a great deal to keep teachers we currently have - but for a

lot of people, it was too little, too late - and a lot of teachers on the

picket lines are ready to leave."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#54:2> Hurley said officials estimate 1,400 new teachers will be needed

next academic year, as well as additional staff to replace those leaving.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#55:2> He noted 200 teaching positions statewide were unfilled this

year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#56:2> By striking, many teachers expected an offer that could put an

end to future contract disputes.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#57:2> However, Hurley and other HSTA members said this offer does not

eliminate the possibility of future strikes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#58:2> " I went on strike to ensure we would never have to go on strike

again, but I don't think it 's that way," an anonymous teacher said. </p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-017#59:3> <h> Hundreds turn out for Relay for Life program </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#60:3> A mixture of smiles and tears - a celebration for survivors and a

time to remember those who've pas 've on - filled the damp air with the warmth

of ohana.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#61:3> At the 7th annual American Cancer Society Relay for Life 2001 at

Old Kona Airport field Saturday night, strangers became family through the

common bond of cancer touching their lives - and no one went untouched.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#62:3> Lifting up his shirt as his smile becomes a frown, 3 - year - old

Jordan Wills, points to his catheter in his tiny chest.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#63:3> " Jordan was diagnosed with leukemia in January," his father,

John said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#64:3> The medicine from chemotherapy is injected into the catheter because

his small body wouldn't take the poking of needles, John said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#65:3> Jordan kept having fevers every other day, his mother, Eleu said,

and they took him to get his blood checked.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#66:3> When the doctor diagnosed their son, John said his immediate

thought was of the worst.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#67:3> " When you hear the word cancer you think of death," he said.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#68:3> John and Eleu said they have kept positive.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#69:3> " We have to for him," Eleu said, adding she and her husband have

crying moments when they are alone together.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#70:3> The family stays positive because Jordan is part of a nation wide

study and the cure for leukemia has gone up over the years from a 40 percent

cure to a 95 percent cure, Eleu said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#71:3> " He 's a fighter," John said, noting there are days when Jordan

gets tired of the chemotherapy treatments.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#72:3> One of the several medications Jordan takes also affects his

emotions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#73:3> " It 's like night and day," John said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#74:3> " He'll 'llhis happy self and once he takes the medicine he 's crying

and screaming."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#75:3> Cancer survivor, Mary Huebner, puts her " cancer survivor" button

on her hand painted shirt with a rainbow leading to the pot of gold for a

cure.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#76:3> Huebner was diagnosed in 1997 with kidney and breast cancer and

has lived her life to the fullest for the last four years with no

reoccurrence.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#77:3> " Your first thought is 'this is a death sentence,'" she said

with tears welling up.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#78:3> " Then you think it 's over and tell yourself, 'I don't want to die,'

and you figure out what to do about it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#79:3> " I had way too much to live for and I fought it all the way down

the line."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#80:3> She said she learned you can't put off doing the things you want

to do and now makes time to do those things.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#81:3> She makes time to spend with her children, grandchildren and 90 -

year - old mother. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#82:3> " My family rallied around me," she said, noting every time she

woke up in intensive care, someone was in the room.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#83:3> The physical side of radiation and surgery were hard on her,

Huebner said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#84:3> During her kidney operation, which had a low probability of

survival, doctors removed one and a half of her kidneys.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#85:3> After two months when she could finally role over, Huebner endured

five months of radiation for her breast cancer following a biopsy, lumpectomy

and removal of her lymph nodes. Financially, Huebner 's cancer took its toll

on her.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#86:3> She said her insurance couldn't cover everything and she was out of

work for eight months recovering from surgery and radiation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#87:3> The relay also touches people who don't personally have cancer.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#88:3> Lucy Pasco volunteers for the American Cancer Society and with

her husband, Jerry, has coordinated the Relay for Life in Kapaau for the last

four years in memory of her sister who died from stomach cancer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#89:3> " It was hard," she said as she excused herself for a minute to

fight the tears.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#90:3> " It was hard to see her go through it and not understand why the

doctor 's couldn't help her."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#91:3> Her sister lived two months after being diagnosed because she was

already in the final stage.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#92:3> Her sister would talk about her " sensitive stomach" but did not go

to the doctor until it was to late to treat.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#93:3> " The only thing I could do for her was to say, 'Sis, I 'm here

for you' and to rub her sore feet and let her know she is loved," Pasco

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#94:3> " And now, I give back to the American Cancer Society hoping

there will be a cure someday - maybe not for me, but for my great -

grandchildren."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#95:3> In 1985, the first Relay for Life was held in Tacoma, Washington

when Dr. Gordon Glatt, a board member for the American Cancer Society Tacoma

chapter, pledged to run for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer

Society.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#96:3> Today 3,000 relays are held every year in the nation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#97:3> The Big Island has four relays in Kapaau, Honokaa, Kailua - Kona

and Hilo. " It showcases American Cancer Society, celebrates cancer

survivorship and honors people who have passed away," Kona chapter executive

director Tina Clothier said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#98:3> " It is very healing."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#99:3> Clothier said the 57 relay teams consisting of about 15 people

each, has already given

&dollar;63,000 to the American Cancer Society.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#100:3> The fund - raising goal for this event is

&dollar;100,000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#101:3> The money benefits cancer patients in Hawaii, helps to fund

national and local research and the American Cancer Society Web site and

national call center, Clothier said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#102:3> Survivors started the relay at 7 p.m. with a " victory lap.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#103:3> The relay will end at 7 a.m. today. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-017#104:3> During the event they had a luminary ceremony to remember those

who did not survive.
<ICE-USA:W2C-017#105:3> Hula, line dancing, a talent show with team participants, as well as

food and game booths kept the teams going throughout the night.</p> </I>
