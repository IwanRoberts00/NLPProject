<ICE-USA:W2D-011#1:1> <h> How to make " calaveras" or Mexican sugar skulls ( Copyright

2011)</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#2:1> The net is an incredible place, because 10 years ago, if I wanted

to make " calaveras," which are those sugar skulls that kids and lovers give

each other for the Mexican holiday El Dia de los Muertos ( the Day of the

Dead), how on earth would I have figured out how to do that without going to

Mexico and hanging out in some grandma 's kitchen?
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#3:1> So I was all excited a couple of weeks back when I ordered my sugar

skull mold ( just a cheap piece of polystyrene that looks like the containers

that things like Ipods and flash drives come in...that stuff thats

practically impossible to cut open without slicing your hands) and got ready

to make 40 calaveras for my fall dinner party. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#4:1> The website that sold me the skull mold ( for an astonishing

&dollar;15 considering the cheap production cost...this stuff is just basically

packaging) has a recipe for sugar skulls that I found repeated virtually

EVERYWHERE on the internet.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#5:1> If a site had a recipe for sugar skulls, this was the recipe.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#6:1> And there simply were no other recipes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#7:1> The problem was that their recipe called for an ingredient called "

meringue powder" which is an obscure ingredient typically only found in

commercial kitchens, and it 's offensively expensive.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#8:1> Sure, their website will be happy to sell you a small quantity, enough

to make about 4 big skulls, for around

&dollar;10. <ICE-USA:W2D-011#9:1> Maybe that 's a bargain if you only want to make 4 skulls ( which,

with your

&dollar;15 mold and

&dollar;10 meringue powder, plus shipping, is going to make your skulls cost around

&dollar;9-&dollar;10 per skull once you buy the rest of the ingredients).
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#10:1> I can't afford that for 40 skulls. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#11:1> But their recipe specifically states, " This recipe will not work

if you leave out the meringue powder, the skulls will fall apart." And it was

the ONLY recipe I could find on the net that looked legitimate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#12:1> " Surely," I thought, " those little grandmas in Oaxaca aren't

pulling out their tin of ultra-expensive imported meringue powder when it 's

time to make calaveras." Knowing that meringue powder is basically powdered

eggs whites, I figured...why not just try using egg whites to help cement the

sugar together, and maybe bake the skulls at a low temperature to speed the

setting and drying process?"
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#13:1> An experiment proceeded to unfold.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#14:1> And I got it right with the first try!
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#15:1> So if you can find yourself a sugar skull mold, here 's how to make

perfect calaveras without meringue powder: 6 cups sugar, 2 egg whites. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#16:1> That 's it folks. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#17:1> Put the egg whites in the bottom of a big bowl, dump in the

granulated sugar, and get your hands all messy squeezing and churning it

together until the sugar feels like wet sand at the beach.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#18:1> You want the sugar to be as dry as possible but still stick together

in the mold, but it 's better for it to be too damp than too dry. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#19:1> Take a handful, dump it into your skull mold and press it down,

and continue until the mold is full.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#20:1> Make certain that you press VERY firmly so the sugar is packed hard

into the skull. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#21:1> Then rake a knife or straight edge across the back of the mold to

give yourself a flat edge for the bottom of the skull. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#22:1> Then take a spoon and scoop out a little sugar from the center of

the back of the skull so that you don't waste sugar and so the skull doesn't

weigh too much. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#23:1> Make sure the walls of the skull will be at least 1" thick when

you dump it out of the mold, or it may collapse on itself. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#24:1> Then take a square of cardboard just a little larger than your

skull, place it against the back of the mold, and flip the mold over. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#25:1> Gently pull the mold up off the sugar and you'll ha 'lla perfect

replica of a skull staring back at you. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#26:1> The mold should come off easily.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#27:1> If it is hard to pull off, your sugar is too wet and you need to add

an extra handful to the bowl and work it in well with your hands.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#28:1> The mold should pull off easily leaving a smooth, perfect replica,

and the drier the sugar is, the better this will happen. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#29:1> Rinse the mold between each skull and dry with a paper towel.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#30:1> Continue making skulls with more sugar and more cardboard squares

until you have all your skulls formed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#31:1> Then, very carefully, place your skulls inside a preheated 200F oven

for 30 minutes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#32:1> When you remove them, the surface will be very hard to the touch.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#33:1> But don't put too much stress on them yet...they need a week of

drying before they'll be 'llrd enough all the way through to handle

vigorously. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#34:1> Google images for " sugar skulls" or " calaveras" to see pictures

of how the skulls are decorated.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#35:1> Traditionally, the name of the person receiving the skull is written

on a piece of colored foil which is placed across the skull 's forehead, and

then the rest of the skull is decorated with brightly colored icing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#36:1> You can get tubes of premixed icing at the grocery store which work

just fine, or make your own by using lots of powdered sugar, an egg white, a

few tablespoons of corn starch, food coloring, and a few drops of water.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#37:1> Stir it until it 's thick, then stuff it into a decorating bag.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#38:1> If you don't have a decorating bag, make a cone of wax paper,

parchment paper, or just plain paper, fill the cone with icing, and cut a

tiny bit off the tip of the cone.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#39:1> Fold the top paper down until you can squeeze the icing out of the

tip you just cut.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#40:1> Use the icing to decorate the skulls, which can be done as soon as

they come out of the oven and cool.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#41:1> Then let the skulls, icing and all, dry for a week and you'll 'lle a

perfect Mexican sugar skull. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#42:1> The recipe above will make about 2 complete large skulls.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#43:1> ( Molds come with a front and a back.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#44:1> You make them separately and then glue them together with icing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#45:1> I found it was just as cool to just make the front of the skull, the

face, and decorate it so it lies flat on the table and stares up at you.) So

the recipe above will make 3-4 large skull faces, but this will vary

depending on the size of your mold.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#46:1> If you make lots of skulls, buy a huge bag of sugar and lots of eggs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#47:1> I went through 25 pounds of sugar and 18 eggs to make 40 skulls, and

only made the front half of the skull. </p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2D-011#48:2> <h> How to meditate</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#49:2> Meditation is a mental discipline by which one attempts to get

beyond the conditioned, " thinking" mind into a deeper state of relaxation or

awareness.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#50:2> There are many different meditation methods. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#51:2> At the core of meditation is the goal to focus and eventually

quiet your mind.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#52:2> As you progress, you will find that you can meditate anywhere and at

any time, accessing an inner calm no matter what 's going on around you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#53:2> You will also find that you can better control your reactions to

things as you become increasingly aware of your thoughts ( letting go of

anger, for example).
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#54:2> But first, you have to learn to tame your mind. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#55:2> 1. Make time to meditate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#56:2> Set aside enough time in your daily routine for meditating.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#57:2> The effects of meditation are most noticeable when you do it

regularly and consistently rather than sporadically. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#58:2> Some people will find a five minute meditation worthwhile, for

others, the benefits of longer meditation are well worth the time. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#59:2> You can meditate at any time of day; some people like to start

their day off with meditation, others like to end the day by clearing their

mind, and some prefer to find refuge in meditation in the middle of a busy

day.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#60:2> Generally, however, the easiest time to meditate is in the morning,

before the day tires your body out and gives your mind more to think about.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#61:2> Don't meditate immediately following a meal, or when you are

likely to be hungry.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#62:2> The body 's digestive system can be very distracting. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#63:2> Find or create a quiet, relaxing environment.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#64:2> It 's especially important, when you' 'restarting out, to avoid any

obstacles to attention.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#65:2> Turn off any TV sets, phone(s) or other noisy appliances.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#66:2> If you play music, make sure it 's calm, repetitive and gentle, so as

not to break your concentration.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#67:2> Meditating outside can be conducive, as long as you don't sit near a

busy roadway or another source of loud noise. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#68:2> Sit on level ground.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#69:2> Sit on a cushion if the ground is uncomfortable.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#70:2> You don't have to twist your limbs into the lotus position or adopt

any unusual postures.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#71:2> The important thing is to keep your back straight, as this will help

with breathing later on. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#72:2> Tilt your pelvis forward by sitting on the forward edge of a

thick cushion, or on a chair that has its back legs lifted off the ground 8

to 10 cm ( 3 or 4 inches). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#73:2> Starting from your bottom, stack up the vertebrae in your spine,

so that they are balanced one on top of another and support the whole weight

of your torso, neck, and head.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#74:2> Done correctly, it feels as if no effort is required to hold your

torso up.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#75:2> ( A small amount of effort is in fact required, but with the right

posture, it is so small and evenly distributed you don't notice it.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#76:2> Relax your arms and legs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#77:2> They don't need to be in any special position, just as long as they

are relaxed and don't interfere with balancing your torso.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#78:2> You can put your hands on your thighs, but it might be easier at

first to let your arms hang at your sides - the hanging weight helps reveal

where things are out of alignment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#79:2> Relax everything, and keep searching for things that aren't

relaxed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#80:2> When you find them, ( and you will), relax them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#81:2> You may find that you can't relax them unless you adjust your posture

so that you are better aligned, and that place doesn't need to work anymore.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#82:2> This commonly happens with muscles near your spine.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#83:2> You may also notice that you are twisted a little and need to

straighten out.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#84:2> Little muscles in your face often keep getting tense, too. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#85:2> Let your attention rest on the flow of your breath.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#86:2> Listen to it, follow it, but make no judgments on it ( such as " It

sounds a little raspy...maybe I' 'mgetting a cold?").
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#87:2> The goal is to allow the " chattering" in your mind to gradually fade

away.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#88:2> Find an " anchor" to settle your mind. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#89:2> Try reciting a mantra ( repetition of a sacred word) or short

Bible verse.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#90:2> A single word like " aum" uttered at a steady rhythm is best.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#91:2> You can recite it verbally or just with the voice in your mind.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#92:2> Beginners may find it easier to count their breaths.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#93:2> Try counting your breath from 1 to 10, then simply start again at 1.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#94:2> To circumvent images that keep intruding on your thoughts,

visualize a place that calms you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#95:2> It can be real or imaginary.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#96:2> Imagine you are at the top of a staircase leading to a peaceful

place.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#97:2> Count your way down the steps until you are peaceful and relaxed.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#98:2> Silence your mind. Once you 've trained your mind to focus on just

one thing at a time, the next step is focus on nothing at all, essentially "

clearing" your mind.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#99:2> This requires tremendous discipline but is the pinnacle of

meditation.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#100:2> After focusing on a single point as described in the previous step,

you can either cast it away, or observe it impartially and let it come and

then go, without labeling it as " good" or " bad".
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#101:2> Take the same approach to any thoughts which return to your mind

until silence perseveres. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#102:2> For some people, focusing attention on a point or object does

exactly the opposite of what meditation is all about.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#103:2> It takes you back to the life of focus, concentration, strain.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#104:2> In this case, as an alternative to the above techniques, some

meditators recommend un-focusing your attention.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#105:2> Instead of focusing attention on a point or an object, this type of

meditation is achieved by attaining a state of zero.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#106:2> Take your attention above all thoughts to a point where you lose all

attention and all thoughts. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#107:2> What you do with a silent mind is up to you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#108:2> Some people find that it is a good time to introduce an intention or

a desired outcome to the subconscious mind.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#109:2> Others prefer to " rest" in the rare silence that meditation

affords. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#110:2> You should be comfortable enough to concentrate, but not so

comfortable that you feel the urge to fall asleep. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-011#111:2> Make some effort to be mindful of your mood and thoughts when

not meditating.
<ICE-USA:W2D-011#112:2> You may notice that you feel calmer, happier, and sharper on days

when you have meditated, and notice a decrease in these qualities when you

have not.</p> </I>
