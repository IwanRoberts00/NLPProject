<p> Under the law in effect before 1978, copyright was secured either on the

date a work was published with a copyright notice or on the date of

registration if the work was registered in unpublished form.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#2:1> In either case, the copyright endured for a first term of 28 years

from the date it was secured.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#3:1> During the last ( 28th) year of the first term, the copyright was

eligible for renewal.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#4:1> The Copyright Act of 1976 extended the renewal term from 28 to 47

years for copyrights that were subsisting on January 1, 1978, or for pre-1978

copyrights restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ( URAA), making

these works eligible for a total term of protection of 75 years.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#5:1> Public Law 105-298, enacted on October 27, 1998, further extended the

renewal term of copyrights still subsisting on that date by an additional 20

years, providing for a renewal term of 67 years and a total term of

protection of 95 years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#6:1> Public Law 102-307, enacted on June 26, 1992, amended the 1976

Copyright Act to provide for automatic renewal of the term of copyrights

secured between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#7:1> Although the renewal term is automatically provided, the Copyright

Office does not issue a renewal certificate for these works unless a renewal

application and fee are received and registered in the Copyright Office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#8:1> Public Law 102-307 makes renewal registration optional.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#9:1> Thus, filing for renewal registration is no longer required in order

to extend the original 28-year copyright term to the full 95 years.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#10:1> However, some benefits accrue from making a renewal registration

during the 28th year of the original term.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#11:1> <h> TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#12:1> Any or all of the copyright owner 's exclusive rights or any

subdivision of those rights may be transferred, but the transfer of exclusive

rights is not valid unless that transfer is in writing and signed by the

owner of the rights conveyed or such owner 's duly authorized agent.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#13:1> Transfer of a right on a nonexclusive basis does not require a

written agreement.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#14:1> A copyright may also be conveyed by operation of law and may be

bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of

intestate succession.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#15:1> Copyright is a personal property right, and it is subject to the

various state laws and regulations that govern the ownership, inheritance, or

transfer of personal property as well as terms of contracts or conduct of

business.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#16:1> For information about relevant state laws, consult an attorney.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#17:1> Transfers of copyright are normally made by contract.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#18:1> The Copyright Office does not have any forms for such transfers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#19:1> The law does provide for the recordation in the Copyright Office of

transfers of copyright ownership.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#20:1> Although recordation is not required to make a valid transfer between

the parties, it does provide certain legal advantages and may be required to

validate the transfer as against third parties.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#21:1> For information on recordation of transfers and other documents

related to copyright, request Circular 12, " Recordation of Transfers and

Other Documents."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#22:1> If sending multiple works, all applications, deposits, and fees

should be sent in the same package.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#23:1> If possible, applications should be attached to the appropriate

deposit.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#24:1> Whenever possible, number each package ( e. g., 1 of 3, 2 of 4) to

facilitate processing.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#25:1> <h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#26:1> What Happens if the Three Elements Are Not Received Together</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#27:1> Applications and fees received without appropriate copies,

phonorecords, or identifying material will not be processed and ordinarily

will be returned.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#28:1> Unpublished deposits without applications or fees ordinarily will be

returned, also.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#29:1> In most cases, published deposits received without applications and

fees can be immediately transferred to the collections of the Library of

Congress.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#30:1> This practice is in accordance with section 408 of the law, which

provides that the published deposit required for the collections of the

Library of Congress may be used for registration only if the deposit is "

accompanied by the prescribed application and fee...."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#31:1> After the deposit is received and transferred to another service

unit of the Library for its collections or other disposition, it is no longer

available to the Copyright Office.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#32:1> If you wish to register the work, you must deposit additional copies

or phonorecords with your application and fee.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#33:1> NOTE: Complete the application form using black ink pen or type.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#34:1> You may photocopy blank application forms.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#35:1> However, photocopied forms submitted to the Copyright Office must be

clear, legible, on a good grade of 8-1/2-inch by 11-inch white paper suitable

for automatic feeding through a photocopier.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#36:1> The forms should be printed, preferably in black ink, head-to-head so

that when you turn the sheet over, the top of page 2 is directly behind the

top of page 1.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#37:1> Forms not meeting these requirements may be returned resulting in

delayed registration. </p> <hSpecial Deposit Requirements </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#38:1> Special deposit requirements exist for many types of works.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#39:1> The following are prominent examples of exceptions to the general

deposit requirements:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#40:1> If the work is a motion picture, the deposit requirement is one

complete copy of the unpublished or published motion picture and a separate

written description of its contents, such as a continuity, press book, or

synopsis.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#41:1> If the work is a literary, dramatic, or musical work published

only in a phonorecord, the deposit requirement is one complete

phonorecord.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#42:1> If the work is an unpublished or published computer program, the

deposit requirement is one visually perceptible copy in source code of the

first 25 and last 25 pages of the program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#43:1> For a program of fewer than 50 pages, the deposit is a copy of the

entire program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#44:1> For more information on computer program registration, including

deposits for revised programs and provisions for trade secrets, request

Circular 61, " Copyright Registration for Computer Programs."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#45:1> If the work is in a CD-ROM format, the deposit requirement is one

complete copy of the material, that is, the CD-ROM, the operating software,

and any manual(s) accompanying it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#46:1> If registration is sought for the computer program on the CD-ROM, the

deposit should also include a printout of the first 25 and last 25 pages of

source code for the program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#47:1> In the case of works reproduced in three-dimensional copies,

identifying material such as photographs or drawings is ordinarily required.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#48:1> Other examples of special deposit requirements ( but by no means an

exhaustive list) include many works of the visual arts such as greeting

cards, toys, fabrics, oversized materials ( request Circular 40a, " Deposit

Requirements for Registration of Claims to Copyright in Visual Arts

Material"); video games and other machine-readable audiovisual works (

request Circular 61); automated databases ( request Circular 65, " Copyright

Registration for Automated Databases"); and contributions to collective

works.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#49:1> For information about deposit requirements for group registration of

serials, request Circular 62, " Copyright Registration for Serials on Form

SE."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#50:1> If you are unsure of the deposit requirement for your work, write

or call the Copyright Office and describe the work you wish to register.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#51:1> An unpublished collection is not indexed under the individual

titles of the contents but under the title of the collection.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#52:1> <h> EFFECTIVE DATE OF REGISTRATION</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#53:1> A copyright registration is effective on the date the Copyright

Office receives all the required elements in acceptable form, regardless of

how long it then takes to process the application and mail the certificate of

registration.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#54:1> The time the Copyright Office requires to process an application

varies, depending on the amount of material the Office is receiving.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#55:1> If you apply for copyright registration, you will not receive an

acknowledgment that your application has been received ( the Office receives

more than 600,000 applications annually), but you can expect:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#56:1> A letter or a telephone call from a Copyright Office staff member

if further information is needed or</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#57:1> A certificate of registration indicating that the work has been

registered, or if the application cannot be accepted, a letter explaining why

it has been rejected.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#58:1> Requests to have certificates available for pickup in the Public

Information Office or to have certificates sent by Federal Express or another

mail service cannot be honored.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#59:1> If you want to know the date that the Copyright Office receives

your material, send it by registered or certified mail and request a return

receipt.</p> <b> CORRECTIONS AND AMPLIFICATIONS OF EXISTING REGISTRATIONS</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#60:1> To correct an error in a copyright registration or to amplify the

information given in a registration, file a supplementary registration

form--Form CA--( filing fee of

&dollar;65 effective through June 30, 2002) with the Copyright Office.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#61:1> The information in a supplementary registration augments but does not

supersede that contained in the earlier registration.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#62:1> Note also that a supplementary registration is not a substitute for

an original registration, for a renewal registration, or for recording a

transfer of ownership.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#63:1> For further information about supplementary registration, request

Circular 8, " Supplementary Copyright Registration."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#64:1> <h> MANDATORY DEPOSIT FOR WORKS PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#65:1> Although a copyright registration is not required, the Copyright

Act establishes a mandatory deposit requirement for works published in the

United States.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#66:1> See the definition of " publication." In general, the owner of

copyright or the owner of the exclusive right of publication in the work has

a legal obligation to deposit in the Copyright Office, within 3 months of

publication in the United States, two copies ( or in the case of sound

recordings, two phonorecords) for the use of the Library of Congress.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#67:1> Failure to make the deposit can result in fines and other penalties

but does not affect copyright protection.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#68:1> Certain categories of works are exempt entirely from the

mandatory deposit requirements, and the obligation is reduced for certain

other categories.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#69:1> For further information about mandatory deposit, request Circular 7d,

" Mandatory Deposit of Copies or Phonorecords for the Library of

Congress."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#70:1> <h> USE OF MANDATORY DEPOSIT TO SATISFY REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#71:1> For works published in the United States, the copyright law

contains a provision under which a single deposit can be made to satisfy both

the deposit requirements for the Library and the registration requirements.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#72:1> In order to have this dual effect, the copies or phonorecords must be

accompanied by the prescribed application form and filing fee.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#73:1> <h> WHO MAY FILE AN APPLICATION FORM?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-010#74:1> The owner of exclusive right(s).
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#75:1> Under the law, any of the exclusive rights that make up a copyright

and any subdivision of them can be transferred and owned separately, even

though the transfer may be limited in time or place of effect.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#76:1> The term " copyright owner" with respect to any one of the exclusive

rights contained in a copyright refers to the owner of that particular right.
<ICE-USA:W2D-010#77:1> Any owner of an exclusive right may apply for registration of a claim

in the work.</p>
