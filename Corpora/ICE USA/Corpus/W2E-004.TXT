<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#3:1> " The time has come to consider creating a global system for

protection of the world community," Boris Yeltsin said on January 31,

addressing President Bush and the United Nations Security Council.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#4:1> " It could be based on a reorientation of the U.S. Strategic Defense

Initiative to make use of high technologies developed in Russia 's defense

complex."
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#5:1> Yeltsin 's proposal is a hot deal for the former enemies: Russia gets

cash, the United States, nuclear technology - and power through the

militarization of space.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#6:1> The losers are the planet and its peoples. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#7:1> A deal to buy Russia 's Topaz 2 space reactor was struck more than

a year ago and announced in January 1991 at the eighth annual Symposium on

Space Nuclear Power Systems in New Mexico.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#8:1> Nikolai Ponomarev-Stepnoi, first deputy of the Kurtchatovis Institute

of Atomic Power in Moscow, explained at the time, " Our institution got its

budget cut 50 percent and ... we need to look for finances from different

sources."
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#9:1> As for the cost to the United States, Richard Verga, director of key

technologies for the Pentagon 's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,

said that Topaz 2 would be used in a program with an overall cost of

&dollar;100 million.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#10:1> The Topaz, a reactor that produces energy through nuclear fission as

it orbits the Earth, uses a " thermionic" design - technology in which Russia

outstrips the United States.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#11:1> It could be mass-produced here to provide power to weaponry on Star

Wars battle platforms. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#12:1> The Topaz 2 deal poses stiff competition to General Electric,

which is developing a Star Wars nuclear reactor of its own, the SP-100, and

is causing a split among U.S. policy-makers.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#13:1> In a January 6 memo the White House Office of Management and Budget

ordered the Energy Department and NASA to give preference to the Topaz 2

because " the potential availability of the Topaz 2 ... offers new

possibilities," and it cut D.O.E. 's SP-100 budget for 1993 from

&dollar;40 million to

&dollar;30 million.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#14:1> The Pentagon also favors the Topaz, claiming it can be deployed in

three years at a tenth the cost of the SP-100, which has a price tag of

&dollar;1.6 billion and can't be tested until 2004.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#15:1> But D.O.E., longtime friend to G.E., insists SP-100 's liquid metal

heat system is " ahead of thermionics." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#16:1> This past January the Russians were back with more deals - and

some veiled threats of selling to Libya - at the ninth annual Symposium on

Space Nuclear Power Systems.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#17:1> This time they were peddling their nuclear-powered rockets.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#18:1> Coincidentally, the Pentagon had just disclosed some of its own plans

for nuclear-powered rockets.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#19:1> Scrubbed in 1972 after seventeen years of development as too

dangerous and too costly ( at

&dollar;1.5 billion already spent -

&dollar;6.5 billion in today 's dollars), the project was covertly reopened for Star

Wars in 1987, code-named Timberwind and kept in deep secrecy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#20:1> Nuclear-powered rockets, with a stronger blast force than

conventional ones, would theoretically be able to loft the massive lasers,

particle-beam devices and other heavy Star Wars weaponry into orbit.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#21:1> Air Force spokesmen admitted to a cost of

&dollar;800 million for the project.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#22:1> The designer and manufacturer of the U.S. nuclear-powered rocket

engine is Babcock and Wilcox, of Three Mile Island fame. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#23:1> Lost in the scramble for dollars and technology is careful

consideration of what the nuclearization of space can cost the planet - in

dollars and in lives.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#24:1> In dollars: The Star Wars budget jumped from

&dollar;2.9 billion in 1991 to

&dollar;4.1 billion this year.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#25:1> The White House in calling for a record 1993 Star Wars budget of

&dollar;5.4 billion. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#26:1> In danger: There has been a 15 percent failure rate in both U.S.

and Soviet nuclear space hardware.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#27:1> The most serious U.S. accident occurred in 1964, when a

plutonium-powered satellite fell toward Earth, breaking up i the atmosphere

and showering plutonium over vast areas of the planet.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#28:1> Russian nuclear-powered satellites have also fallen to Earth.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#29:1> The 1978 crash of Cosmos 954 covered a broad swath of Canada with

radioactive debris.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#30:1> Topaz or SP-100, Timberwind or Russian rocketry, they're Chernobyls 'rein the sky. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#31:1> Government documents on Timberwind told of a prototype of the

nuclear rocket failing on the ground.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#32:1> Still, the Pentagon planned a test flight, which for " safety"

reasons would take place mostly over water around Antarctica, though New

Zealand is on its path.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#33:1> A government analysis put the chances of the nuclear rocket crashing

into New Zealand at 1 in 2,325.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#34:1> ( For some perspective on these odds, recall that the chances of a

Challenger-type disaster were estimated at 1 in 100,000.) The Topaz 2 has

been used in only two missions, in 1987.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#35:1> Both ended because of a malfunction in the reactor. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#36:1> This past July, insuring against accidents with U.S. nuclear

space machinery, NASA and D.O.E. signed a Space Nuclear Power Agreement

limiting U.S. liability in the event of a nuclear accident in space to

&dollar;7.3 billion to Americans for property damage or death from radioactive

contamination and

&dollar;100 million, total, for citizens of all other nations.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#37:1> Five months earlier, the United States withdrew support for U.N.

draft guidelines on the use of nuclear space devices because the Defense

Department and NASA feared that Star Wars might be hindered by such a treaty.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#38:1> It 's the nuke world order. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#39:1>
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#40:1> <h> Toxic Banking </h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#41:1> <h> DOUG HENWOOD</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#42:1> " I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste

in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#43:1> The publication of these words, from a leaked internal memo, caused a

rush of bad publicity for their author, World Bank chief economist Lawrence

Summers, who now claims he was being ironic and provocative.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#44:1> There were calls for his resignation.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#45:1> But Summers was expressing honestly the logic of his discipline and

his employer. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#46:1> Summers - whose salary is 225 times the per-person income of the

bank 's Third World clientele - is a whiz-bang Harvard econocrat, a class that

believes religiously that money is the final measure of value.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#47:1> Happiness is a growing G.D.P.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#48:1> Legal issues can be resolved as competing economic claims, and

ethical decisions can be translated into dollar terms, with the cheaper

alternative always preferable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#49:1> In his memo, which criticized a draft of the bank 's World

Development Report, Summers was applying cost-benefit analysis, which

measures the value of a human life by the stream of wages remaining to it.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#50:1> Say it will cost Global Megatoxics

&dollar;1 million to install a state-of-the-art scrubber in its chimney.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#51:1> If Global determines that not spending this sum will shorten the

lives of five people by ten years apiece, all that would be lost would be the

present value of these fifty years of wages.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#52:1> At a wage of

&dollar;1,000 a year, the cost of the five lives can be figured at

&dollar;41,000, thanks to the magic of compound interest; at

&dollar;30,000 a year, they're worth
 'reollar;1.2 million.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#53:1> As Summers said in his memo, " health-impairing pollution should be

done in the country with the lowest cost, which will be the country with the

lowest wages."
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#54:1> Since the costs of pollution - always priced in dollars or their

equivalent - rise with development, Summers argued, it makes sense costwise

to dump in Africa.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#55:1> If a pollutant is going to cause " prostrate" cancer, a disease of

old age, why not locate it in countries where people aren't likely to live

long enough to get it?
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#56:1> He concluded this section by saying that disagreement with this logic

suggests the belief that things like " intrinsic rights to certain goods,

moral reasons, social concerns, lack of adequate markets, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#57:1> could be turned around and used more or less effectively against

every Bank proposal for liberalization.?
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#58:1> Exactly; as they should be. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#59:1> It makes no sense for Summers to resign; he expressed the bank 's

logic perfectly.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#60:1> It 's a bank, and acts like one.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#61:1> It may preside over a steady erosion of Third World incomes relative

to First World ones, but it makes big money.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#62:1> Last year, after paying

&dollar;7 billion in interest and fees to its investors and bankers, it had a

&dollar;1.2 billion surplus and a rate of return that commercial banks would envy.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#63:1> What 's a public institution to do with that kind of surplus?
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#64:1> The bank 's executive board spends a lot of time working that question

over.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#65:1> In 1991 it decided to contribute

&dollar;267 million to its soft-loan affiliate, which lends to very poor countries

at concessional rates,

&dollar;29 million to the Global Environment Trust Fund and stuff the remaining

&dollar;904 million into its hoard of 'retaine 'rearnings,' which now stands at

&dollar;11.9 billion.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#66:1> According to Unicef, preventing vitamin-A-deficiency blindness would

cost

&dollar;6 million.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#67:1> Preventing " the great majority" of childhood malnutrition deaths

would cost

&dollar;2.5 billion.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#68:1> But adding to the World Bank 's surplus is a higher priority. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#69:1> In recent years, the bank has moved away from project-oriented

lending - power plants and dams - and toward structural adjustment lending,

in which credit is conditional on adoption of a standard

austerity/deregulation package.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#70:1> Not surprisingly, these schemes have savage effects, to which the

bank has a ready answer - more loans.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#71:1> The bank is lending its clients more money to treat the poverty,

social dislocation and environmental damage that earlier loans helped create.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#72:1> The bank funds greenhouse-gas reduction schemes in countries where

the greenhouse-gas producers were initially financed by the World Bank. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#73:1> Bank publicity makes much of a new environmental consciousness,

but actions tell a different story.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#74:1> The bank exempted structural adjustment programs from environmental

review even though their point is to work human and physical resources harder

which can't be friendly to people or their environment.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#75:1> It has redlined its environment department, leaving it little power.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#76:1> World Bank claims to a larger role in global environmental politics -

to be pressed, for example, at this spring 's United Nations Conference on the

Environment and Development - should be beaten back with heavy sticks. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#77:1> Whether or not Summers returns to Harvard, waste export will be a

growth industry for these sluggish times.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#78:1> The practice of shifting dirty industries to poor countries is well

established.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#79:1> Greenpeace follows the routine stuff all over the world - German (

per capita income:

&dollar;20,440) plastic to Argentina (

&dollar;2,160), U.S. (

&dollar;20,910) mercury to South Africa (

&dollar;2,470), car batteries from everywhere to Brazil (

&dollar;2,540). <ICE-USA:W2E-004#80:1> Plastic dropped into recycling bins is likely to be shipped

to Malaysia (

&dollar;2,160). <ICE-USA:W2E-004#81:1> The logic is impeccable. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#82:1> <h> IMPLANTS: TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCES</h>
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#83:1> <h> KATHA POLLIT</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#84:1> The F.D.A. hearings into the safety of silicone gel breast

implants have ended with a split recommendation by the advisory panel:

Rejecting an out-right ban on the devices, it urges that implantees be

registered in clinical trials, to which only women who needed the surgery for

reconstructive, not cosmetic, purposes would be guaranteed admittance.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#85:1> Which is it - " Panel Backs Marketing of implants" ( The Washington

Post) or " Experts Suggest U.S. Sharply Limit Breast Implants" ( The New York

Times)"
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#86:1> You be the judge. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-004#87:1> Whatever else they were, the hearings were great theater.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#88:1> There was the perfidy of Dow ( Napalm? Agent Orange? What 's that?)

Corning, the largest manufacturer of the implants, which was revealed to have

lied and stonewalled for almost thirty years.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#89:1> There was the pious greed of plastic surgeons, who aggressively

marketed the devices as a " cure" for " micromastia" small breasts, to you)

and now warn of an epidemic of " hysteria" in breast-enlarged women newly

enlightened about the risks of autoimmune disorders, painful scarring,

obscured mammograms.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#90:1> There was a hero, too, if a few decades late - David Kessler, the

F.D.A. 's energetic new head.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#91:1> But most of all there were breasts - sex, beauty, fashion, women,

women 's bodies.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#92:1> Does anyone think the implant story would have been plastered all

over the news media if it was about orthopedic shoes?
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#93:1> The real breast-implant story, though, isn't about women 's bodies;

it 's about their minds.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#94:1> In the postfeminist wonderland in which we are constantly being told

we live, women 's lives are portrayed as one big smorgasbord of " choices" and

" options", all value free and freely made, and which therefore cannot be

challenged or even discussed, lest one sound patronizing or moralistic.
<ICE-USA:W2E-004#95:1> Thus, women " choose" to have implants, we are told, to please men -

no, wait, to boost their self-esteem - and who are you to criticize their

judgment?</p> </I>
