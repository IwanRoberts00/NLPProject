<ICE-USA:W1B-024#1:1> <h> MINNESOTA MINING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#2:1> <h> For the Year Ended December 31, 1993</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#3:1> <h> Item 1. Business.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-024#4:1> Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company was incorporated in

1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware to continue operations, begun in

1902, of a Minnesota corporation of the same name.
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#5:1> As used herein, the term " 3M" includes Minnesota Mining and

Manufacturing Company and subsidiaries unless the context otherwise

indicates.
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#6:1> 3M employs 86,168 persons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-024#7:1> 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial

interdivision and intersector cooperation in research, manufacturing and

marketing of products incorporating similar component materials manufactured

at common internal sources.
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#8:1> Its business has developed from its research and technology in coating

and bonding for coated abrasives, its only product in its early years.
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#9:1> Coating and bonding is the process of applying one material to

another, such as adhesives to a backing ( pressure-sensitive tapes), abrasive

granules to paper or cloth ( coated abrasives), ceramic coating to granular

mineral(roofing granules), heat- or light- sensitive materials to paper, film

and metal ( dry silver paper, photographic film and lithographic plates),

iron oxide to plastic backing ( magnetic recording tape), glass beads to

plastic backing ( reflective sheeting), and low tack adhesives to

paper(repositionable notes).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-024#10:1> 3M believes that it is among the leading producers of products

for many of the markets it serves.
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#11:1> In all cases, 3M products are subject to direct or indirect

competition.
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#12:1> Generally speaking, most 3M products involve technical competence in

development, manufacturing and marketing and are subject to competition with

products manufactured and sold by other technically-oriented companies.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-024#13:1> 3M 's three business sectors are: Industrial and Consumer;

Information, Imaging and Electronic; and Life Sciences.
<ICE-USA:W1B-024#14:1> Each sector brings together common or related 3M technologies and

thus provides greater opportunity for the future development of products and

services and a more efficient sharing of business strengths.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-024#15:1> The notes to the financial statements on page 25 and 26 of this

Form 10-K provide financial information concerning 3M 's three industry

segments and 3M 's operations in various geographic areas of the world.</p>

dependent upon any one patent, license or trade secret or any group of

related patents, licenses or trade secrets. </p>
