<ICE-USA:W2A-036#1:1> <H> Introduction</h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#2:1> Two major forces have shaped the current drive to implement format

integration.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#3:1> First, usage of USMARC as the basis of library catalogs has become

common for all library types throughout the country; very few libraries rely

solely on card access to their collections anymore.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#4:1> With the growth of automated systems, vendors and librarians alike

have been interested in better standardization of these formats.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#5:1> Secondly, as our culture continues its evolution from a primarily

paper-based environment to one where multimedia plays an increasing role, the

nature of published materials has changed dramatically.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#6:1> Publishers market monographs with accompanying material ranging

anywhere from computer diskettes to kazoos.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#7:1> Multimedia works often encompass several different material types such

as CD-ROMs, printed guides and computer files.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#8:1> These changes have presented an ongoing challenge to catalogers and

system librarians.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#9:1> How can we best describe these multi-faceted items and ensure their

retrieval in automated systems?</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#10:1> Discussion about unifying the seven separate USMARC bibliographic

formats began in 1983.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#11:1> Format integration was envisioned as a means to simplify

documentation, reduce redundancy across formats, enable catalogers to work

more easily with multiple formats, and improve machine validation of MARC

records.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#12:1> Although the need for format integration was identified over a decade

ago, its implementation has been slow.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#13:1> The need for compatibility in sharing data among the Library of

Congress, the bibliographic utilities and various local systems has been the

biggest challenge with format integration and has contributed to the delays

in its implementation.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#14:1> The phrase " format integration" applies to changes in the USMARC

bibliographic formats only.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#15:1> Other MARC formats, such as authorities, holdings, classification and

community information remain unaffected.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#16:1> It encompasses coordination across forms of material, removing the

restriction on data elements that have previously made them valid only for

specific forms of material.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#17:1> In spite of the efforts involved in the implementation of format

integration, the bulk of the alterations in USMARC will affect just a small

percentage of cataloging records.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#18:1> <H> Implementation </h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#19:1> The first portion of format integration came in 1991, with USMARC

Update No.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#20:1> 3.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#21:1> This update included a few changes that primarily involved the

implementation of blank indicator values.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#22:1> The rest of format integration was originally planned to be

implemented simultaneously.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#23:1> However, as the planning for implementation progressed, it became

clear that the changes to the variable fields had a much smaller impact on

systems which handle MARC records than the fixed field changes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#24:1> Due to the difficulty of implementing the latter, MARBI accepted a

proposal in 1993 to split the remainder of format integration into two

phases, variable fields and fixed fields.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#25:1> This compromise allowed the variable field portion to be implemented

sooner, instead of postponing the entire project until the fixed field

portion could be ready.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#26:1> The variable field phase of format integration was implemented in

late January of 1995.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#27:1> This phase essentially validated all variable fields across all

formats, while eliminating some obsolete fields.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#28:1> This article focuses on the final phase of format integration, which

affects the Leader and 001-008 fixed fields.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#29:1> The Library of Congress and the bibliographic utilities have

scheduled the implementation of this phase for March 3, 1996.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#30:1> There are several changes that will impact catalogers and systems in

the final phase.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#31:1> * Changes to the Leader/06 ( Type of record) Remove: b = archival and

manuscripts control add: p = mixed material t = manuscript language material

* Definition of Leader/08 ( Type of control) blank = no specified type of

control a = archival control</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#32:1> The changes to the Leader/06 ( Type of record) and the definition

of Leader/08 ( Type of control) will have a significant impact on the coding

of archival materials.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#33:1> These modifications recognize that archival control is not limited to

a particular type of material.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#34:1> With the final phase of format integration, archivists will be able

to better distinguish between various material types, such as monograph vs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#35:1> serial, and also will not be limited to choosing archival control

over the visual materials format when describing an archival film, for

example.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#36:1> This structural change in the MARC record necessitates some

alterations in how the bibliographic utilities will handle archival records.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#37:1> OCLC will eliminate the Archival and Manuscript Control format ( AMC)

and will introduce a new format, Mixed Materials, to accommodate records for

which no single other format predominates.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#38:1> In RLIN, the AMC file will remain, intended for use with archival

collections of mixed materials or any individual material type.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#39:1> The RLIN-specific archival control segment ( ARC), previously valid

only in the AMC and visual materials files, will be made available for use in

all formats when the material represented by the bibliographic record is

under archival control.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#40:1> * Validate values for 007 ( Physical Description Fixed Field)

across all formats</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#41:1> The extension of field 007 to all formats enables specific

encoding of all the physical aspects present in the item in hand.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#42:1> The field may be repeated when different parts of the item have

different characteristics, such as a positive and a negative polarity

microfilm cataloged on the same record, or to represent the secondary nature

with mixed material.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#43:1> * Changes to 008/byte 06 ( Date entered on file) Redefine

detailed date from " d" to " e" in all formats Remove actual date and

copyright date ( " c" in most formats) Define publication date and copyright

date " t" for all formats Validate other values across all formats,

including: " c" - serial item currently published " d" - serial item ceased

publication</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#44:1> * Changes to 008/bytes 07-14 ( Date 1/Date 2) " u" - Date element

is totally or partially unknown " blank" - Date element is not applicable

With the final phase of format integration, the first 17 bytes of field 008,

plus the final five, will have consistent definitions across all formats,

while bytes 18-34 will remain format specific.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#45:1> The changes inherent in this process will introduce non-serial

catalogers to some serial date codes, just as variable field format

integration introduced tag 246 across all formats.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#46:1> The biggest change in field 008 is the shift from using " c" to " t"

to indicate copyright date.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#47:1> Another change which will arise with some frequency is the ability to

code unknown dates with " u" instead of the current practice of using zeros

to complete unknown dates.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#48:1> * Redefine 006 field ( Fixed-Length Data Element - Additional

Material Characteristics)</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#49:1> Full implementation of format integration will finally enable

catalogers to describe material with characteristics which are representative

of more than one MARC bibliographic format.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#50:1> In the current cataloging environment, once the decision is made

about the primary nature of the material, certain aspects of the secondary

nature are lost in the description.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#51:1> Examples of such mixed materials include: a book with an accompanying

sound recording, or a serially issued score.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#52:1> Even though format integration of the variable fields addresses the

specific description problems with these mixed materials, without the

accompanying fixed fields, machine manipulation of all aspects of the

cataloging record is limited to the primary material type described in field

008.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#53:1> The redefinition of field 006 will change all that.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#54:1> The 006 parallels the material-specific bytes of field 008, allowing

the representation of all aspects of an item for subsequent machine

manipulation, even that pesky serially published map on CD-ROM.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#55:1> Field 006 will be used only for those materials which encompass more

than one material type.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#56:1> It has a leading character which identifies the secondary nature of

the material, that is book, serial, score, recording, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#57:1> For a summary of the 006 field, see the chart below.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#58:1> The leading character in field 006 will determine what the valid

codes are for the secondary nature.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#59:1> The remainder of the 006 bytes match those of the 008 for a

particular material type, in the same fashion currently that the 007 leading

byte defines the following values.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#60:1> The tables reproduced at the end of this article summarize the

definitions of the 006 field for books, music, and serials, with the codes

used by OCLC, RLIN and WLN in the equivalent 008 fields at this time.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#61:1> <&> It is unclear whether or not the following paragraph, which

is encapsulated by quotation marks, is in fact a quote with a source of

origin distinct from the author.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#62:1> It has been included here for lack of evidence against my assumption,

which is that the quotation marks here are not being used to indicate a

quote</&>"Field 006 will have no indicators or subfield codes.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#63:1> The field will have a generic-tree structure, whereby the category of

material code given in 006/00 ( Type of 006 code) will determine the data

elements defined for subsequent character positions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#64:1> For each category of material, the codes defined for character

positions 01-17 will be the same as those defined for that category in field

008 ( Fixed-Length Data Elements), character positions 18-34." - USMARC</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#65:1> When encountering material that exhibits multiple material type

characteristics, a question remains about how to select the primary aspect.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#66:1> USMARC sets forth a model, reproduced below, to assist with the

decision-making.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#67:1> In spite of this model, interpretation about whether or not an item

is basically textual will still rest with cataloger judgment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#68:1> Note that the selection of the primary characteristic determines the

appropriate chapter of AACR2r to be used as the basis for the description.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#69:1> Thus, in shared databases, the description may vary somewhat

depending on which characteristic is chosen as the primary one.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#70:1> <&> The material below has been maintained formatting seems to be

intact.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#71:1> <H> Impact </h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#72:1> The impact that full format integration will have on our

cataloging databases depends on several factors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#73:1> As with variable field format integration, some changes to existing

records will be able to be made by a simple machine substitution; however,

other changes will have to be made manually.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#74:1> It seems unlikely that libraries will go back and recatalog items

with multiple characteristics, or that the utilities will add field 006 to

existing records in their databases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#75:1> In fact, it is difficult to identify older records that might benefit

from the addition of field 006.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#76:1> It is important to remember that these older records are not "

incorrect." Instead they will not reflect the full content designation

available with the format integrated version of USMARC.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#77:1> Additionally, field 006 is optional; thus usage of this field will

vary among institutions according to their perceived needs, the national

libraries' practices, and the nature of the material being cataloged.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#78:1> The five cataloging examples included at the end of this article

demonstrate some of the changes with this phase of format integration.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#79:1> At this point, it is difficult to determine exactly how the various

utilities and local systems will handle the upcoming changes with the final

phase of format integration.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#80:1> Decision points include: indexing field 006 for retrieval;

identifying cataloging records by material type when more than one type is

represented; implementing new MARC screen designs which will not fill the

first page of the cataloging record with fixed field options and modifying

validation routines which take the new options into account.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#81:1> The bibliographic utilities and system vendors have started

announcing some of their planned changes via their web sites ( see

http://www-rlg.stanford.edu/welcome.html,

http://www.oclc.org/oclc/menu/home1.htm, and the Library Vendors section at

http://lcweb.loc.gov/global/library/library.html#vendors).
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#82:1> How the systems and utilities choose to index field 006 for retrieval

will be based on their pre-existing file structures.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#83:1> Depending on the programming, these decisions may have a significant

impact on record retrieval when a user qualifies by material type.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#84:1> If the material-specific bytes of fields 008 and 006 cannot be

searched concurrently, multiple searches of a given database may be needed to

retrieve all relevant records.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#85:1> The display of search results may also be dependent on the coding of

the primary material characteristic.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#86:1> As the March 1996 implementation date draws closer, the utilities and

vendors will make more specific information available about how the final

phase of format integration affects searching in their systems.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-036#87:1> The utilities' implementation of this phase of format integration

will cause some changes in the familiar screen displays.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#88:1> In OCLC, look for new standardized labels and layout of the fixed

fields across all formats.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#89:1> Field 006 will display as a variable field, although users will be

able to enter and edit this tag either directly, or as a prompted display

with mnemonics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-036#90:1> RLIN will automatically generate templates for field 007 based on the

file type.</p> </I>
