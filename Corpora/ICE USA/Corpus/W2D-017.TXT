<ICE-USA:W2D-017#2:1> Collectors' Corner</h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#3:1> <h> Collecting U.S. Coins </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#4:1> United States coins are made at four Mint facilities:

Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point, NY.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#5:1> One easy way to start your collection is with the circulating coins

you use daily - pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and dollars.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#6:1> In addition, the U.S. Mint also issues annual proof and uncirculated

sets, national medals, and commemorative coins. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#7:1> Here are categories of U.S. numismatic items you can collect:</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#8:1> <h> 1. Program Coins.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#9:1> In January 1999, a unique and historically compelling 10-year

celebration of the states began. For the 50 State Quarters(tm) Program, a

series of five quarter-dollars with new reverses will be issued each year

until 2008. All 50 states will be honored in the order they joined the Union.

</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#10:1> <h> 2. Annual Coin Sets.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#11:1> Each year, the U.S. Mint packages sets of the proof and the

uncirculated coins that were produced during the year and sometimes the

previous year.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#12:1> You can purchase current - year sets directly from the Mint.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#13:1> Generally, for prior years, you will need to buy the sets from coin

dealers or other collectors. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#14:1> <h> 3. Proof Sets.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#15:1> Unlike circulating coins, proof coins display brilliant

mirror-like backgrounds, with frosted, sculpted foregrounds. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#16:1> <h> United States Mint Proof Set</h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#17:1> <h> 4. Uncirculated Mint Sets.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#18:1> These coins are struck using the same process for circulating

coins, but they have quality enhancements - slightly higher coining force,

early strikes from dies, special cleaning after stamping, and protective

packaging in Mylar(r). </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#19:1> <h> United States Mint Uncirculated Set</h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#20:1> <h> 5. Commemorative Coins. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#21:1> Authorized by Congress, commemorative coins typically celebrate

and honor American people, places, events, or institutions. They are

generally available directly from the U.S. Mint for a limited time only. They

may remain available from collectors and coin dealers thereafter. Sales of

these coins can benefit the organizations authorized by Congress in the

commemorative coin legislation. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#22:1> <h> 6. American Eagle Proof Coins.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#23:1> These platinum, gold, or silver proof coins are produced from

individually selected planchets that have been polished to a high luster.

They are struck at least twice on specially adapted coining presses, bringing

even the most minute of details with remarkable clarity. The finished proof

coin, with its frosted cameo image on a mirror-like field, is then

white-glove inspected and placed in special packaging designed to help

protect and present its showmanship. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#24:1> <h> 7. National Medals.</h><p><ICE-USA:W2D-017#> The U.S. Mint produces these

selective awards authorized by Congress. National medals commemorate the

nation 's significant historical events or honor individuals whose superior

deeds and achievements have enriched our nation or the world. When

legislation permits, bronze duplicates may be struck for sale to the public.

For example, in 1999, bronze replicas were available for the gold medals

honoring Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#25:1> <h> 8. Special collectibles.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#26:1> In addition, the U.S. Mint periodically produces special editions

of its products, such as first-day coin covers, coin and die sets, as well as

items such as coin jewelry and holiday ornaments that feature coins. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#27:1> <h> 9. Errors and Misstrikes.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#28:1> Most error coins and misstrikes are found and recycled before

they ever leave the U.S. Mint. The few that do make it into circulation,

though, are often perceived to be collectibles. Collectors classify these

coins into three major categories: die errors, planchet errors, and striking

errors. Within each, there are also subcategories, such as off-center

strikes, overdates, and multiple-struck coins that are of significant

interest to some collectors. You can learn more about this category through

national error clubs, coverage of errors in numismatic publications, and the

formal cataloging of mint errors. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#29:1> It 's easy to start a coin collection.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#30:1> You can begin with coins that you already have on hand.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#31:1> Check your pockets, wallet, desk drawers and under the sofa cushions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#32:1> Most people are surprised to discover the variety of coins hiding in

their home 's forgotten nooks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#33:1> Then, ask friends and relatives if they have any old or unusual coins

to contribute. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#34:1> To organize and display your collection, you may want to purchase

one or more coin albums.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#35:1> Some are custom-made for specific coins, such as Kennedy Half

Dollars; other albums hold all denominations.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#36:1> Additional storage and display options include paper envelopes,

plastic tubes, slabs, flips, and Mylar(r) staple holders.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#37:1> See " Storing and Displaying Coins" for more information. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#38:1> Learning how to become a coin collector also means learning a new

language.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#39:1> Coin collectors use a common vocabulary to discuss coins.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#40:1> Special terms are used to describe a coin 's condition, value, and

what it looks like.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#41:1> See " The Anatomy of a Coin " and the " Coin Term Glossary. " </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#42:1> <h> Tools of the Trade</h>

<p> Here are the basic tools you'll need to 'll started building and

organizing your coin collection: A high-quality magnifying glass so you can

look at a coin 's tiny details. A padded jeweler 's tray, plush towel, or some

other soft cloth to set coins on when viewing them. A plastic ruler that

measures in inches and millimeters.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#43:1> Avoid hard, metal rulers that may scratch your coins. A good general

coin reference book.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#44:1> It should include information on dates, mint marks, major varieties,

grading guidelines, and prices. Good lighting, such as a halogen lamp. Soft,

cotton gloves. Coin envelopes, holders, or albums for storing your coins.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#45:1> There are four questions you should answer when determining

whether to add a coin to your collection:
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#46:1> Does the coin have eye appeal?
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#47:1> What appeals to any individual collector is always subjective.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#48:1> If the coin doesn't appeal to you, don't buy it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#49:1> It 's likely that if you think the coin is ugly, other people will

too. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#50:1> How is the original luster?
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#51:1> There is no way to restore a coin 's luster - the characteristic

flashy sheen seen on a new coin - once it 's gone. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#52:1> Is there any damage?
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#53:1> Scratches, bag marks, staple marks, corrosion, and other damage will

decrease a coin 's value. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#54:1> How much wear is there?
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#55:1> According to experts, wear tends to be the single biggest factor that

determines the grade given to a coin. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#56:1> Should you buy coins for your collection, or is it better to find

them?
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#57:1> You certainly can do either - or both.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#58:1> The combination approach can be a good way to enhance your

collection.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#59:1> For example, as the new coins in the 50 State Quarters ( tm) Program

are released into circulation ( five per year from 1999 to 2008), you can

save coins for each state as you find them in your change.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#60:1> In addition, you also may want to purchase special collectibles

related to the program, such as proof sets, uncirculated sets, or first-day

coin covers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#61:1> What if you have decided to collect coins from a certain year,

but you are having trouble finding them?
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#62:1> Then, you may want to purchase the hard-to-find coins from a coin

dealer or another collector, adding depth and value to your collection. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#63:1> Here are some sources to build your collection ( the U.S. Mint

does not recommend, regulate, or endorse individual providers of goods or

services): Your local bank. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#64:1> Purchase rolls of coins to search through collectors and coin

clubs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#65:1> Trade or buy from other collectors, either privately or at coin

clubs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#66:1> Purchase coins directly from the U.S. Mint 's catalog, which is

also available online at www.usmint.gov/catalog. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#67:1> Buy or trade with reputable coin dealers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#68:1> You can try using the following venues.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#69:1> You may want to ask an experienced collector for dealer referrals.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#70:1> Here you can shop from several dealers at once.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#71:1> The selection at coin shows will be much better than at most

individual shops, and the prices will be more competitive. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#72:1> Many dealers sell coins through the mail.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#73:1> Check the numismatic publications for their ads.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#74:1> Make sure the dealer has a reasonable return policy before ordering,

and examine the coins carefully on receipt to ensure that they're
 'reatisfactory. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#75:1> Hundreds of dealers - including many conventional mail order

advertisers - offer coins on the Internet.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#76:1> Again, make sure the dealer has a reasonable return policy before

ordering, and examine the coins carefully on receipt to ensure that they're
 'reatisfactory.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#77:1> And use your good judgment! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#78:1> The rarest and most expensive coins often are available only

through major auction houses.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#79:1> In addition, many collectors now sell coins on auction Web sites.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#80:1> ( As with online dealers, make sure the seller has a reasonable

return policy and examine the coins carefully upon receipt to ensure that

they're s 'resfactory.) Note: It is not uncommon for auction bids to surpass

prices of comparable coins sold in other venues.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#81:1> It 's a good idea to check prices in shops, mail-order ads, and on

other Web sites in advance.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#82:1> Then, to avoid overpaying, limit your bids to the market-value prices

you've 'vend. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#83:1> Although they are not primary sources, sometimes coins can be

found at these events.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#84:1> Because there is less competition for the seller and many potential

buyers, prices may be inflated.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#85:1> In addition, sometimes these venues are used to move problem coins.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#86:1> Use caution and common sense when buying at these events.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#87:1> <h> Caring for Coins</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#88:1> To retain the value and look of your coin collection, proper care

and storing is essential.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#89:1> <h> Cleaning</h>

<p> While you may be tempted to clean your coins to make them look shiny and

new - proceed with caution.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#90:1> Most of the time, cleaning makes coins look worse and, more

importantly, reduces their value.</p>

<p> f you absolutely must clean a coin to remove dirt, use good-quality mild

soap and water.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#91:1> Once you've 'vehed the coin, pat it dry with a soft towel.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#92:1> Don't brush or rub it, which can scratch the coin 's delicate surface.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#93:1> Believe it or not, older coins that show the deep coloration of age

are far more desirable than coins whose surfaces have been stripped away by

improper cleaning. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#94:1> To preserve the value and natural condition of your coins, it is

important that you handle them carefully.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#95:1> A coin should be held by its edges between the thumb and forefinger.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#96:1> This protects the coin 's surface and design from fingerprints and the

natural oils on your skin that can be corrosive.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#97:1> Never hold a coin so that your fingers touch the obverse or reverse

surface.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#98:1> Doing so can leave fingerprints, which are difficult to remove. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#99:1> Some experienced coin collectors use soft cotton gloves when

handling their uncirculated or proof coins.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#100:1> If you choose not to wear gloves, make sure your hands are clean

before handling your coins.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#101:1> Also, hold coins over a soft towel or other soft surface in case you

drop them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#102:1> Finally, don't talk directly over your coins because tiny, almost

invisible droplets of saliva can drop onto the coin and show up later as

spots.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#103:1> Just like fingerprints, those marks are difficult, if not

impossible, to remove. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#104:1> 1. Always store your coins in a place that is consistently cool

and dry.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#105:1> Sharp changes in temperature and moisture promote tarnish and spots

that will devalue your coins.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#106:1> For instance, don't store your coins in the attic or basement where

the environment temperature can fluctuate significantly. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#107:1> 2. Keep your coins in their original holders, if at all

possible.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#108:1> All modern proof sets and commemoratives should be bought and sold

in their original cases and capsules. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#109:1> 3. Save the Certificate of authenticity and the information card

that comes with U.S. Mint proofs, uncirculated sets, and commemorative sets.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#110:1> These items are considered to be part of the set, and if they are

missing, your coins will be harder to sell. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#111:1> 4. As your collection becomes more valuable, you may want to

store it in a safe-deposit box.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#112:1> Or, if you choose to keep your collection at home, check with your

insurance company to make sure it 's covered for the full replacement cost.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#113:1> Flips are clear plastic holders with two pockets - one for the

coin, the other for a label.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#114:1> Some flips, such as those made of Mylar(r), are good for storing

coins but can be a little stiff and brittle.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#115:1> When you put a coin into a flip or take it out, " bow" the flip to

avoid scratching the coin - press both edges gently to make a wide opening

for the coin. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-017#116:1> Soft plastic holders aren't always a better alternative.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#117:1> You definitely want to avoid them if they contain polyvinyl chloride

( PVC).
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#118:1> This chemical, used to make plastics softer, will take a valuable

coin and turn it into a sticky, worthless mess.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#119:1> How?
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#120:1> Over time, the sticky film spreads from the container to your coin,

eating into its surface.
<ICE-USA:W2D-017#121:1> For this reason, it 's been nicknamed " green slime." </p> </I>
