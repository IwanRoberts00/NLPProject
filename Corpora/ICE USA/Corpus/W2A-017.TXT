<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#1:1> Until the latter part of the nineteenth century, divorce was

largely proscribed by law and shunned in practice much as still happens today

in many nations including some European countries such as Italy and Ireland.6
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#2:1> Most marital disruptions occurred not as a result of divorce but from

desertion or informal separation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#3:1> Because population surveys were not available prior to the middle part

of the twentieth century, it is difficult to know how often de facto divorce

took place in the United States.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#4:1> But, it seems likely that all but a small minority of marriages

survived until the death of one or another partner, an event that typically

occurred much earlier than it does today.7 Some have argued that the rise of

divorce was partly prompted by increasing survival rates, which placed a

greater strain on the ability of couples to manage marital stress or maintain

marital contentment.8
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#5:1> However, there is no firm evidence to support this conjecture.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#6:1> Divorce rates in the United States began to rise shortly after the

Civil War and continued on a steady upward course for more than a century.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#7:1> Over this time rates have fluctuated, often falling in poor economic

times and generally surging after major wars.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#8:1> But these short-term variations have been far less consequential to

the long-term pattern of constant growth.9
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#9:1> Nearly two decades ago, Preston and McDonald calculated the likelihood

of divorce for each marriage cohort beginning in 1867 and continuing until

the mid-1960s.10
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#10:1> Their results showed a continuous trend of dissolution among

successive marriage cohorts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#11:1> Roughly 5&percent; of marriages ended in divorce just after the Civil War

compared with an estimated 36&percent; in 1964.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#12:1> Thus, the pattern of prevalent divorce was firmly in place in this

country even before the divorce revolution of the 1960s.</P>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#13:1> Nonetheless, there was a sharp increase in the incidence of

divorce from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#14:1> During a span of a decade and a half, divorce rates for married women

more than doubled ( from 10.6 per 1,000 in 1965 to 22.8 in 1979), pushing the

risk of divorce much higher for all marriage cohorts, especially those who

wed after the mid-1960s.11
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#15:1> Some researchers speculated that a majority of all marriages

contracted in the 1970s and after would end, especially when both informal

separations and formal divorces were counted.12
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#16:1> Other researchers reached more conservative estimates but still

projected that more than two in every five marriages would end in divorce

when divorce rates reached their peaks in the middle 1970s.9</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#17:1> Divorce rates began to level off in the late 1970s and actually

declined by about 10&percent; during the 1980s.13
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#18:1> As mentioned earlier, fluctuations of this sort are common

historically and do not necessarily signal a reversal in divorce trends.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#19:1> Nonetheless, most demographers think that divorce is not likely to

continue its upward pattern, at least in the near term.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#20:1> There are several demographic explanations for the failure of divorce

rates to increase after the 1970s which do not necessarily imply that

Americans today are becoming more committed to staying married than they were

in the previous two decades.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#21:1> The huge cohort of baby boomers, reacting to changing economic

opportunities, postponed marriage.9,14
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#22:1> A larger proportion opted to obtain more schooling and wait to form a

family.15
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#23:1> Marriage age for women rose from just above 20 in the mid-1950s to

24.4 in 1992, an increase of more than four years.16
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#24:1> It has long been known that early marriage and lower education are

associated with marital instability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#25:1> 17 Thus, the pattern of delayed marriage might have had a role in

curbing the rates of divorce.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#26:1> Another potent source of marital disruption, associated with

early marriage, is premarital pregnancy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#27:1> Fewer marriages today occur as a result of a premarital pregnancy.18
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#28:1> It also seems plausible that the greater availability of

contraception and abortion in the 1970s may have discouraged the formation of

early unions, reducing the number of ill-considered marriages, though

evidence to support this hypothesis is not available.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#29:1> Furthermore, the population has been getting older as the baby

boomers mature.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#30:1> Older couples in long-standing marriages have a lower propensity to

divorce.19
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#31:1> Thus, as the baby boomers reach middle age, a larger proportion of

those married have passed through the high-risk years, when their marriages

are young and relatively more fragile.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#32:1> Finally, growing rates of cohabitation before marriage may have

brought down the rate of divorce.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#33:1> As more and more couples elect to live together prior to marrying, it

seems likely that many unions that would have ended in divorce end before

marriage occurs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#34:1> That is, a growing number of Americans are divorcing without

marrying, making the official divorce statistics a less reliable barometer of

union stability.20</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#35:1> For all these reasons, it is probable that the modest drop in

divorce rates does not indicate a higher propensity toward marital stability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#36:1> Instead, the composition of those marrying has changed in ways that

only make it appear that marriages are becoming more stable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#37:1> Not so many years ago, it was common for family experts to reassure

those who were alarmed at the steady increase in divorce rates by pointing

out that divorce typically is not a terminal event but a transition from one

marriage to the next.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#38:1> So it was said that couples who separated lost faith in a particular

marriage but not in the institution of matrimony.21
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#39:1> In 1975, close to three-fourths of all women in their fifties who had

experienced a divorce had remarried.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#40:1> For formerly married men, the occurrence of remarriage was even

higher, about four in five eventually remarried, owing to the greater pool of

eligible partners.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#41:1> ( It is easier for men to attract younger partners than it is for

women.)
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#42:1> But recently, the rate of remarriage has been declining.22 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#43:1> In part, the trend toward lower remarriage rates may reflect the

greater tendency to postpone second unions as both men and women may be more

willing and able to live as single persons.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#44:1> But recent evidence from the National Survey of gests the rate of

recoupling has not declined notably.23
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#45:1> Many divorced persons have become more cautious about reentering

matrimony, preferring instead to cohabit in informal and more fluid unions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#46:1> This pattern, discussed below, poses particular problems for children

who are, to an increasing extent, being raised by quasi-stepparents who are

often transitional figures in their households.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#47:1> The lower rates of remarriage may reflect a growing reluctance to

formalize unions after a failed first marriage.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#48:1> Couples who remarry are known to have a higher risk of divorce than

couples entering first marriages.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#49:1> And divorces from second marriages occur more quickly than from first

unions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#50:1> Cherlin has shown that the proportion of couples who will marry,

divorce, remarry, and redivorce has risen eightfold during the course of this

century, climbing from barely 2&percent; of those who were born in the first decade

of the twentieth century to 16&percent; of those born after 1970.9
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#51:1> Cherlin described the changing patterns of marriage, divorce, and

remarriage for four birth cohorts of women ( see Figure 2 in the article by

Shiono and Quinn in this journal issue).
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#52:1> For all but the most recent cohort, the proportion ever marrying

remained relatively stable while the prevalence of divorce, remarriage, and

redivorce progressively increased.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#53:1> In the youngest cohort, women born after 1970, Cherlin projects that

marriage ( and remarriage) will decline significantly and divorce will remain

high among women who elect to marry or remarry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#54:1> Rising rates of marital instability have been experienced by all

Americans regardless of socioeconomic status, race, religious affiliation, or

region of the country.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#55:1> However, the extent of marital instability differs enormously among

various social groups.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#56:1> It is beyond the scope of this article to explore in detail the

patterns described above for different social classes, religious groups, or

regions of the country.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#57:1> It is hard to ignore, however, racial/ethnic differences in patterns

of marriage, divorce, and remarriage because the experiences for whites,

African Americans, and some Hispanic groups are so very disparate.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#58:1> African Americans have long exhibited different patterns of family

formation.24
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#59:1> As far back as the nineteenth century, blacks were more likely to

marry earlier, had a higher incidence of premarital pregnancy and nonmarital

childbearing, formed less stable unions, and were less likely to remarry when

disruption occurred.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#60:1> Scholars disagree on the origin of these patterns.25
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#61:1> Some believe that they are rooted in different notions of kinship

brought to America; others argue that distinctive patterns of family

formation emerged in slavery; and still others contend that these family

differences did not really take hold until after Emancipation, when black

Americans were exposed to economic discrimination and racism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#62:1> Still others argue that the differences are more recent in

origin.26</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#63:1> Whatever the particular origin or combination of origins, there

is convincing evidence that African Americans are much less likely to marry,

more likely to divorce, and less likely to remarry when divorce occurs.27
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#64:1> More than 90&percent; of whites will marry compared with about 75&percent; of African

Americans; of those who do wed, African Americans have a substantially higher

risk of divorce.13
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#65:1> Ten years after marriage, 47&percent; of blacks have separated or divorced

compared with 28&percent; of non- Hispanic whites.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#66:1> Blacks are also far less likely to remarry after separating.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#67:1> As a result, African Americans spend far less time in marriage than

do whites.28
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#68:1> Much less information exists on the marriage patterns of other racial

and ethnic groups.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#69:1> Census data on Hispanics suggest that their levels of marriage,

divorce, and remarriage fall somewhere between those of whites and those of

blacks.13
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#70:1> However, official statistics actually conceal as much as they reveal

about the behavior of different Latino groups. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#71:1> There is reason to suspect that as much difference exists between

Cubans or Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans as between whites and blacks in

rates of marriage and marital stability.29
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#72:1> Still, such as it is, the evidence on Hispanic subgroups reveals

similar trends to those described for blacks and whites in the United States.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#73:1> In sum, virtually all population subgroups have experienced a

postponement of marriage, a steady increase in divorce, and a decrease in

remarriage after divorce.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#74:1> Cohabitation as a prelude, aftermath, and perhaps alternative to

marriage has become more common.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#75:1> These patterns are more evident among African Americans.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#76:1> The declining institution of marriage has important ramifications for

patterns of childbearing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#77:1> Typically, now, marriage no longer regulates the timing of sex, and

to an increasing degree, it no longer regulates the timing of first birth.30
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#78:1> Nonmarital childbearing has become more prominent over the past

several decades as rates of marital childbearing have declined and rates of

nonmarital childbearing have held steady or increased.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#79:1> In 1960, only 5&percent; of all births occurred to unmarried women; in 1990,

this proportion had risen to 28&percent;.31
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#80:1> The increase for whites has been tenfold, from 2&percent; to 20&percent; in this

30-year period.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-017#81:1> Figure 1 depicts the remarkable rise in the number of first

births among women between the ages of 15 and 34 which have occurred before

marriage for whites, blacks, and Hispanics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#82:1> Among each of the racial/ethnic subgroups, the increase has been

remarkable over the past 30 years.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#83:1> For whites this number rose from 8.5&percent; for births occurring in the

early 1960s to 21.6&percent; for those that took place in the late 1980s.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#84:1> The rise for blacks was even more spectacular, going from 42.4&percent; in

the early 1960s to 70.3&percent; in the late 1980s.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#85:1> The proportion for Hispanics doubled during the same period, going

from 19.2&percent; to 37.5&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#86:1> Clearly, out-of-wedlock childbearing has become a far more important

source of single parenthood for all Americans and especially so for African

Americans, who now have a sizable majority of first births before marriage.18

( See Figure 1.)
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#87:1> The weakening of marriage as a social institution is not unique to

the United States.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#88:1> Most developed countries are witnessing similar demographic trends.32
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#89:1> In some instances, the retreat from marriage is even more pronounced.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#90:1> For example, in Scandinavia cohabitation has become a widely accepted

alternative to marriage.33
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#91:1> France and England have higher proportions of out-of-wedlock births

than occur in the United States, though a higher proportion of these births

occur to parents who are cohabiting than in this country.34
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#92:1> Divorce rates have also risen sharply in a number of European

nations, though none equals this country in the prevalence of divorce.
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#93:1> Still, about a third of marriages in Northern Europe will end in

divorce; in England and Scandinavia, as many as two in five marriages may

dissolve.35
<ICE-USA:W2A-017#94:1> Thus, explanations for the de-institutionalization of marriage cannot

reside solely in the special features of American culture or society. </p>
