<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#3:1> There is a lack of information on the environmental fate of

herbicides used for silvicultural purposes in the Lake states region.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#4:1> Water quality is an important issue, and pesticides are a major focal

point of public concern.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#5:1> Pesticide persistence and mobility in the soil are key factors in

water-quality issues.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#6:1> Knowledge of herbicide half-lives and leaching characteristics in

forested environments is limited primarily to data from southern or western

states; little research has been done in the Lake states or the Northeast [

1].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#7:1> The objective of this study was to determine the environmental fate of

three soil-active herbicides - - hexazinone, sulfometuron methyl, and

tebuthiuron ( Velpar L?, Oust? ( E.I. du Pont de Nemours Inc., Wilmington,

DE), and Spike? ( DowElanco Inc., Indianapolis, IN))-- in low base saturated

sand soils that had been preconditioned by treatment with acidified rainwater

for four years. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#8:1> The behavior of a chemical in the soil is determined by properties

of both the chemical and the soil environment [ 2].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#9:1> Important properties of herbicides are water solubility, soil

adsorption, chemical and photodegradation, microbial breakdown, and

volatility [ 3].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#10:1> Primary environmental conditions include precipitation amount and

distribution, temperature, soil type, organic matter content, and pH.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#11:1> Large areas of low base saturated sand soils in the Lake states

region are subject to acidification by atmospheric deposition [ 4].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#12:1> Interactions among atmospheric deposition, soil acidity, organic

matter content, the environmental fate of herbicides, and their potential

effects on water quality have not been investigated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#13:1> We hypothesized that the combination of coarse soil texture, low base

saturation, low organic matter content, and preconditioning would represent

worst-case conditions likely to be encountered in the upper Lake states

region.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#14:1> This paper reports effects of litter-humus treatments, amount of

applied precipitation, soil characteristics, and rainwater acidity on

behavior of the three herbicides. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#15:1> <h> METHODS </h>
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#16:1> <h> <it> Materials </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#17:1> Lysimeters were used to determine the mobility and dissipation of

the soil-active herbicides hexazinone [

3-cyclohexyl-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4(1<it> H </it> ,

3<it> H </it> ) - dione]; sulfometuron methyl ( methyl 2- [ [ [ [ (

4,6-dimethyl-2- pyrimidinyl)amino]-carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]benzoate); and

tebuthiuron ( <it> N </it> - [ 5- (

1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]-<it> N </it> , <it> N </it> ' -

dimethylurea) in acid sandy soils.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#18:1> 14C-labeled hexazinone, sulfometuron methyl, and tebuthiuron were

used to spike the commercial formulation of each product.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#19:1> The specific activities of [ 14C]carbonyl hexazinone, [ 14C]phenyl

sulfometuron methyl, and [ 14C]5- thiadiazole-ring tebuthiuron were 263.1,

218.3, and 429.2 kBq/mg, respectively. </p> <it>
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#20:1> <h> Lysimeters </h> </it>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#21:1> Detailed soil and site characteristics and lysimeter methodology

were reported previously [ 4].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#22:1> Briefly, intact soil columns were collected in 15- x 150-cm polyvinyl

chloride ( PVC) pipes from six sites on national forest in northeastern

Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and Upper Michigan in October 1984.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#23:1> The sites were selected to provide soils with either 0 to 10 or 10 to

20&percent; base saturation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#24:1> The soil columns were transported to the Forestry Sciences Laboratory

at Grand Rapids, Minnesota ( 47?20'N, 93?30'W).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#25:1> Lysimeters were constructed by sealing the base of each with a

watertight PVC cap and instrumenting it with 70- <foreign> ? </foreign> m

porous polyethylene filters to sample soil water at the 10-,20-,40-, and 150-

cm levels.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#26:1> The completed columns were installed at the original soil depth to

maintain normal soil temperatures and atmospheric conditions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#27:1> They were covered with Fiberglass shelters at night and during

rainstorms to exclude dust and ambient rainfall. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#28:1> <h> <it> Preconditioning </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#29:1> To minimize variation in forest floor thickness among soil

columns, the litter- humus layer was removed from each and replaced with a

cap prepared from 400 g of coarsely ground litter-humus from a jack pine or

mixed hardwood stand or with an equal weight of quartz sand.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#30:1> Kentucky-31 bluegrass ( <it> Poa pratensis </it> L.) was established

on each to stabilize the cap and to provide an active root system.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#31:1> Rainwater was collected from a greenhouse roof, stored at 3 to 52C in

a polyethylene tank, and acidified to pH 5.4 or 4.2 with a 1:1 solution of

HNO3 + H2SO4.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#32:1> Half of the soil columns received rainwater acidified to pH 5.4, and

the other half received rainwater at pH 4.2.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#33:1> Applications were made weekly throughout the growing season, and the

leachate was collected periodically.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#34:1> During the four-year preconditioning period, a total of 4,600 mm of

water was applied. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#35:1> <h> <it> Design and treatment </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#36:1> The study was conducted using a randomized complete block design

with four herbicide treatments, including an untreated control, applied to

soils from each of the six sites, with six replications.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#37:1> Thus, each herbicide treatment was applied to 36 soil columns, for a

total of 144 lysimeters.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#38:1> The herbicides were applied to the surface of the soils on July 28,

1989; application rates of active ingredient ( a.i.) were 2.24kg/ha of

hexazinone ( 47.9kBq 14C per lysimeter), 42.5 g/ha of sulfometuron methyl (

47.0 kBq 14C per lysimeter), and 2.24 kg/ha of tebuthiuron ( 93.4 kBq 14C per

lysimeter).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#39:1> On the following day, 10 ml of 1.0 M NaCl solution was applied to

each column as a conservative ion tracer to indicate the Cl- breakthrough

volume.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#40:1> Acidified rainwater was applied to the columns once weekly at rates

to approximate the actual precipitation recorded at an adjacent official

weather station.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#41:1> The amount of water applied substantially exceeded actual

precipitation on three treatment dates, both to enable collection of

sufficient sample volume at the upper soil levels and to simulate rainfall

representative of worst-case conditions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#42:1> Soil water was collected once at the 10-, 20-, and 40-cm levels and

10 times at the 150-cm level over the 130 of post-treatment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#43:1> At each sample date, all leachate was collected and weighed;

subsamples were subsequently analyzed for herbicides and 24 chemical

parameters.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#44:1> Samples were stored at 3 to 52C until all analyses were completed.

</p> <it>
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#45:1> <h> Analyses </h> </it>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#46:1> Concentrations of Cl- in leachate were measured with an ion

chromatograph ( Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#47:1> 14C was determined in a 3.0-ml subsample by liquid scintillation

counting techniques with correction for quenching and background.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#48:1> Count rates were converted to concentration of chemical in solution.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#49:1> The 14C was confirmed to be parent compound by HPLC analyses using a

Hewlett Packard ( Avondale, PA) model HP 1090 with a Radiomatic flow detector

( Radiomatic Instruments, Meriden, CT) with C8 and C18 columns and different

solvent systems and comparing retention times of samples to standards.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#50:1> The 14C was predominantly parent compounds with trace amounts of

unidentified metabolites.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#51:1> Losses due to plant uptake and degradation were not considered.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#52:1> The recovered 14C was analyzed by concentration ( micrograms per

liter) and total amount ( percentage of a.i. applied).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#53:1> Data were evaluated by analysis of variance ( ANOVA) with leachate

volume as a covariate.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#54:1> Treatment differences were tested with the least significant

difference ( LSD) procedure [ 5]. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#55:1> <h> <bold> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#56:1> Ambient precipitation for the 60-d post-treatment period was 254

mm, 96 mm above the 50-year mean [ 6].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#57:1> Elevated Cl- concentrations appeared in leachate collected at the

150-cm level 45 d post-treatment, after 154 mm of rainwater had been applied

( Table 1), indicating displacement of the initial soil solution from the

lysimeters.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#58:1> Thus, the 440 mm of water applied during the 130-d study period was

approximately three times the mean pore volume of the soils and double the

50-year average precipitation for this area. </p> <&> [ TABLE 1 OMITTED] </&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#59:1> Rainwater pH had no significant effect on herbicide movement,

apparently due to high soil acidity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#60:1> In 1984, before the acid rain treatments began, pH of the surface 40

cm of soil ( in 0.02 M CaCl2) from four of the six sites averaged 4.3 [ 4];

current acidity has not been determined. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#61:1> Leaching of the three herbicides differed significantly by

litter-humus treatment, quantity of applied rainwater, and soil

characteristics.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#62:1> The variation in mobility reflects differences in their physical and

chemical properties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#63:1> Sulfometuron methyl has a short half-life and is not readily soluble,

particularly under acidic conditions [ 7,8].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#64:1> From 80 to 130 d post-treatment, no sulfometuron methyl was detected

below the 20-cm level ( Table 2), and none was found in leachate at 150 cm at

any sample date.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#65:1> By 80 d post-treatment, the 14C activity was near background level,

suggesting that most of the compound had been degrade [ 8] or irreversibly

sorbed into the upper soil layers. </p> <&> [ TABLE 2 OMITTED] </&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#66:1> Concentrations of hexazinone and tebuthiuron at 10 and 20 cm

were, respectively, nearly two and fivefold greater than those at 150 cm,

indicating that most of the products remain in the upper portion of the

profiles after the first growing season.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#67:1> Tebuthiuron is about 10 times as soluble as sulfometuron, as

reflected by the higher concentrations at the 10- and 20-cm levels and its

presence lower in the profiles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#68:1> It was detected in leachate at the 150-cm level from 12 of the 36

treated soil columns.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#69:1> Hexazinone is highly soluble and is subject to both lateral and

vertical movement under conditions conducive to leaching [ 9].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#70:1> Under the conditions of this study, hexazinone reached the 150- cm

level in 31 of the 36 lysimeters.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#71:1> Measurable concentrations of hexazinone first appeared in leachate at

150 cm from seven of the 36 columns 52 d post- treatment ( Table 3).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#72:1> Tebuthiuron was first detected in leachate from two lysimeters 66 d

post-treatment after 286 mm of water had been applied.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#73:1> The highest concentrations of both hexazinone and tebuthiuron

occurred 80 d post- treatment ( Table 3), following application of 44 mm of

water over the previous two-week period, the smallest application since

displacement of the pore volume ( Table 1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#74:1> These results agree with both field plot and watershed studies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#75:1> In a field study in Alberta, Canada, Feng et al. [ 10] found an

inverse relation between hexazinone concentrations and leachate volume.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#76:1> In catchment-scale studies, very large storms generally do not result

in high chemical concentrations due to dilution by large flow volumes; the

intermediate storms frequently produce the higher concentrations [ 11]. </p>

<&> [ TABLE 3 OMITTED] </&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#77:1> The amounts of both hexazinone and tebuthiouron reaching the

150-cm level varied significantly by collection date, due to amount of

applied rainwater.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#78:1> The above average ambient precipitation following herbicide

application and consequent heavy rainwater applications undoubtedly

contributed to the quantity of materials reaching the 150-cm level [ 12].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#79:1> Bowman [ 13] documented greater mobility and leaching of two triazine

herbicides in soil cores that received supplemental watering, compared to

those that received natural rainfall.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#80:1> The relation between leachate volume and the percentage of each

product recovered at the 150-cm level was highly significant ( <it> p </it>

<0.01, <it> r </it> =0.71 for hexazinone and <it> r </it> =0.44 for

tebuthiuron).The higher coefficient for hexazinone reflects its greater

solubility Beckie and McKercher [ 14] found a close relation between the

position of the wetting front in soil columns and movement of two

sulfonylurea herbicides, suggesting a high leaching potential in coarse

textured soils.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#81:1> The greatest amount of both products at the 150-cm level occurred 101

d post-treatment ( Table 3), following application of 88 mm of water, the

largest treatment of the year ( Table 10).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#82:1> This treatment amount is nearly equivalent to a 25-h rainfall of 3.5

in. ( 8.9 cm); the probability of a storm of this magnitude at this site is

one in 10 years [ 15]. </p> <&> [ TABLE 4 OMITTED] </&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#83:1> Leaching of both hexazinone and tebuthiuron differed

substantially by site ( Table 4).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#84:1> Movement of tebuthiuron is determined largely by soil properties.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#85:1> It is strongly adsorbed by organic matter and clay particles [

16,17], resulting in large differences among sites in both concentration and

amount of recovered chemical.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#86:1> No tebuthiuron reached 150-cm level in soils from sites 2 or 3, where

pH of the surface 40 cm of soil was 4.7 and base saturation averaged 22&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#87:1> Small amounts were recovered from the four more acidic sites, where

pH averaged 4.3 and mean base saturation was <6&percent;. 
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#88:1> The soils of sites 2 and 3 were classified as Aquic Udipsamments; the

other four sites were either Entic Haplorthods, Typic Udipsamments, or Spodic

Udipsamments [ 4].
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#89:1> These data suggest that soil pH and base saturation of the upper

horizons, in conjunction with soil classification, may be of value in

identifying sites where tebuthiuron is likely to leach below the rooting

zone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#90:1> On these same sites, soil properties had far less influence on

movement of hexazinone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#91:1> Despite the twofold difference in both concentration and percentage

of hexazinone among the six sites, the differences were not significant (

<it> p </it> >0.05). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-028#92:1> The litter-humus treatments had a most pronounced effect on

leaching of both hexazinone and tebuthiuron ( Table 5).
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#93:1> Humus type ( hardwood pine) did not significantly affect movement of

hexazinone; however, hardwood humus was particularly effective in retaining

tebuthiuron in the upper portion of the profiles.
<ICE-USA:W2A-028#94:1> The lack of a litter-humus cover increased the amount of hexazinone

reaching the 150-cm level by nearly threefold and that of tebuthiuron by

nearly fivefold. </p> </I>
