<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#1:1> His knees are bent and his arm curls beneath his head as he " goes

to the ground."
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#2:1> " Bueno?" he asks; " Is this alright?" " Yes."
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#3:1> He does moforibale to show his respect to the oricha that he has just

received and to the oricha that " lives" in his godfather 's head.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#4:1> His godfather touches his shoulders with his fingers and helps him up.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#5:1> The aleyo crosses his arms across his chest and is drawn to his

elder 's cheek, first on one side and then on the other.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#6:1> His padrino says softly, " <it> Santo, Ocha, Alafia </it> ." ( Lu. and

Sp. " Saint, Oricha, Peace,").
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#7:1> This gesture is repeated as he greets all of his elders and receives

their blessings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#8:1> He now belongs to their ritual family.5 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#9:1> A young man in an Eastern city of the United States enters a new

religious community; he is receiving a group of important deities and

entering into fictive kin relationships with his initiators.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#10:1> He must have his head washed and his body cleaned by animals, and

must perform the moforibale; to enter this tradition, he uses his body in

ways that are new to him.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#11:1> As he receives the gods, he learns new patterns of body use.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#12:1> The creation of these new bodily patterns in the Guerreros initiation

ritual presents an interesting case: The signs used in the ritual have

meanings that can be communicated verbally, but here the signs are

experientially apprehended through the body; they are not simply understood

but are also enacted. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#13:1> In recent years, studies of cultural performances have

demonstrated clearly that meaning is not latent in ritual signs and awaiting

discovery; instead people involved in ritual performances engage signs and

activate them ( Schieffelin 1985:107).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#14:1> Through performance, people communicate cultural meanings; by

employing the various culturally relevant and available communicative

resources, including specific generic and gestural forms, people produce

their culture.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#15:1> This production takes place in all cultured behavior, and ritual--any

ritual--effectively opens the door to understanding the entire culture ( V.

Turner 1967).6
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#16:1> Cultural performances " are occasions in which as a culture or

society we reflect upon and define ourselves, dramatize our collective myths

and history..." ( MacAloon 1984a:1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#17:1> Although communicative resources such as ritual do carry specific

expectations for all involved, only through enactment and negotiation can

meaning be established and understood.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#18:1> As Richard Bauman has written: Performance, like all human activity,

is situated, its form, meaning, and functions rooted in culturally defined

scenes or events-bounded segments of the flow of behavior and experience chat

constitute meaningful contexts for action, interpretation, and evaluation [

1986:31] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#19:1> Cultural performances--performances of cultural forms--can only

have meaning and functions when enacted ( Abrahams 1977:95), and enactments

often produce heightened experiences for participants. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#20:1> Because this initiate, whom I will call George Carter, was not

born into Santeria, these experiences are new to him.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#21:1> These new bodily activities, quite common to the tradition, represent

a change for Carter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#22:1> To enter the tradition fully, he must learn to use his body in new

ways; he must master certain gestures and series of actions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#23:1> As he experiences himself enacting new gestures and cultural forms of

behavior, he realizes that his body is both a sign communicating meanings in

a new way and simultaneously a locus of new experiences ( Cowan 1990:4; cf.

B. Turner 1984:1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#24:1> His body is not simply a constructed sign that links him to the

group; instead, the individual 's body mediates all of the ritual signs, for

he can only act by employing his body ( Douglas 1978:87; cf. Ekman 1977).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#25:1> The enacting of these forms by the body represents the " modes of

construction" of a culturally specific and useful body ( Feher 1989:11).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#26:1> Carter needs to be able to enact each of the three gestures that I

will explore in order to enter the religion more fully.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#27:1> He must understand <it> and </it> experience the importance of his

head, he must learn the detailed gestures of sacrifice, and he must show

respect by prostrating himself in front of his elders.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#28:1> Carter learns to be a part of the community by using his body in

specific ways. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#29:1> This initiation ritual begins the establishment of new " habitual

body sets, patterns of practical activity, and forms of consciousness" (

Jackson 1989:119-120).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#30:1> The activities of the ritual and the meanings therein are

inseparable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#31:1> In social action, an essential communicative form in Santeria,

pragmatic and semantic dimensions fuse; ideology is not an explicit discourse

but an embodied, lived experience ( Comaroff 1985:5).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#32:1> Because meaning merges with actions, the ritual represents the

creation of a new <it> habitus </it> in the initiate; it is an enactment of

some of the " principles of the generation and structuring of practices and

representations" ( Bourdieu 1989[1977]:72).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#33:1> Practitioners do provide detailed evaluations of social actions and

ceremonies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#34:1> An effective ritual is called <it> linda </it> ( Sp. beautiful), and

this choice of language suggests that the sought-after quality is aesthetic

and nonanalytical.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#35:1> The manipulation of physical objects--those used on altars and in

sacrifices, as well as bodies-produce the elusive but beautiful ceremony.7

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#36:1> This habitus represents a new historical position for the

neophyte in the case described above.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#37:1> This ritual is an important initiation on the road to the priesthood;

it creates new bodily patterns for the initiate and thus inscribes the body

into the new discourse.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#38:1> Previously abstract verbal knowledge is enacted and incorporated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#39:1> Never before has he had his head washed in omiero; never before has

he been cleaned by the sweepings of birds' wings; never before has he

performed the moforibale.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#40:1> The giving and receiving of the Guerreros. repeated many times and in

many places each year, assimilates people more fully into the community and

gives them limited access to the supernatural world, and this example is no

different.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#41:1> Here, however, the medium for assimilation is Carter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#42:1> He must enact respect and embody the tradition. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#43:1> This embodiment of tradition in the ritual context structures

Carter 's experience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#44:1> As he uses his body in new ways and places it in new positions, he

makes physical certain relationships and experiences them bodily; the

initiation, then, regulates experience " through its capacity to reorganize

the actor 's experience of the situation" ( Munn 1973:605).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#45:1> In spite of the fact that initiations vary according to the

performers involved and that these variations affect the structure of the

ritual ( Hanks 1984:131), the aleyo 's body always structures the experience.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#46:1> In Santeria, the teaching of ritual skills and moral behavior

happens informally and nonverbally; thus embodiment is especially important.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#47:1> Ritual elders tire quickly of answering questions and suggest that

the best method of learning is involvement.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#48:1> By paying attention and attending many rituals, an aleyo becomes

known as <it> serio </it> ( Sp. a serious student of the religion; see

Friedman 1982) People learn this religion not through the exegesis of

important concepts but primarily through observation and enactment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#49:1> Since learning centers on practice and entering actively into this

tradition, the body naturally emerges as central to any analysis of this kind

of ritual ( cf. Wafer @991).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#50:1> This learning takes place slowly, and so it is extremely difficult to

document.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#51:1> I have focused here on the body but it exists in a complex

relationship with social knowledge and interpretation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#52:1> The informal learning style of Santeria makes social knowledge a kind

of esoteric power.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#53:1> People who know certain ceremonies exercise power in the community.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#54:1> My analysis reflects the social realities of this community.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#55:1> Ritual focuses on the body and its manipulation, and personal

experience represents the primary method for understanding.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#56:1> When a practitioner integrates experience with more commonly held,

culturally produced expressive forms, like divination stories, social

knowledge is expanded.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#57:1> " The essential part of the <it> modus operandi </it> which defines

practical mastery is transmitted in practice...without attaining the level of

discourse" ( Bourdieu 1989[1977]:87).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#58:1> Carter clearly grasps this emphasis on practice and the use of the

body: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#59:1> Although I had never done too much in Santeria before, I...I

guess I wanted to be part of the community which I was joining, to act like

they do.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#60:1> I wanted to be involved and do what they did so I would learn the

religion. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#61:1> Involvement must be physical to be complete; although Carter

knows a great deal about the beliefs and sacred stories of Santeria, he

greatly values entering the habitus of the community and expects to learn

from his experience. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#62:1> <h> <it> Washings and the Head </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#63:1> Because no expressive body activity happens without real bodies

and no meanings can be assigned to gestures without reference to an

historically specific event ( Poole 1975:101), the specific example at hand

best reveals Carter 's bodily practice.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#64:1> The community of ritual specialists washes Carter 's head as he

prepares to enter the community.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#65:1> He leans over with eyes closed to receive their attention and

blessings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#66:1> The herbal mixture " cools" and " refreshes" him.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#67:1> His head is washed over a basin and then again in the bathtub.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#68:1> Each time, the padrino rubs the omiero, and the herbs floating in it,

into his skin and scalp. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#69:1> In the bathroom cleansing, which I have witnessed many times, the

gestures of the ritual are highly stylized.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#70:1> The aleyo leans over the tub and places the chest on the edge; the

hands rest on the bottom, one on top of the other.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#71:1> I have seen this priest, whom I will call Jose, demonstrate to people

how they should position themselves as they receive the <it> despojo </it> (

Sp. cleaning).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#72:1> Through this instruction in how properly to perform the gesture, Jose

shows that he has an aesthetic by which he evaluates it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#73:1> Similarly, Jose washes the head with a specific pattern of movements.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#74:1> He takes the omiero from its basin in a small gourd and pours it

first over the crown of the head and then over the neck.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#75:1> Again starting at the crown, he lathers the soap by moving it around

the head in growing circles until he reaches the neck, which he scrubs

vigorously.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#76:1> He then rinses the head with more omiero and squeezes the water from

the hair with a motion similar to the one with which he lathers it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#77:1> These highly stylized gestures reveal a culturally structured pattern

of bodily movement, and although they are performed by the padrino, they

suggest that the despojo does contain gestures that the aleyo learns and

experiences through his body. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#78:1> The head, which receives most of the attention in the cleaning,

carries complex and multiple symbolic meanings in Santeria.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#79:1> First, the head, called either <it> ori </it> or <it> eleda </it> ,

is the spiritual faculty and central being of a human ( Murphy 1981:287)

Before birth, each ori goes before the Creator and receives its essential

character.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#80:1> This character, which people closely associate with an individual 's

destiny, can be either " hot" or " cool" ( Cabrea 1980:121).
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#81:1> While practitioners disagree about how mutable the head as character

is, the ritual washing here in refreshing herbs and water helps to cool a hot

head.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#82:1> The head also idiomatically refers to the oricha that rules a person;

an individual and the deity also establish this relationship in front of the

Creator before birth ( see Bascom 1991:115). </p> </i>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#83:1> This central deity, often called " the owner of the head,"

represents an important part of the individual 's character.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#84:1> For example, the white, calm, and generous oricha Obatala rules the

head of Carter 's padrino, and so people assume that Jose is slow to anger,

relatively intellectual, benevolent, and, others might add, " big-headed."8
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#85:1> In fact, at times practitioners confuse the " owner of the head" and

the individual; " an Obatala" refers to a child of Obatala and in ritual may

act in the role of that oricha.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#86:1> The eleda can be identified through various divination systems, and a

growing relationship between an individual and the eleda often leads to

initiations, after which the <it> ache </it> ( Lu. power. essence) of the

oricha literally resides inside the initiate 's head; after a full initiation,

the oricha can " mount" the initiate in trance possession and thus take

control of the body that they share.9 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#87:1> In the Guerreros initiation, the aleyo, with the help of the <it>

oloricha </it> ( Lu. priests), cleans and refreshes his head.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#88:1> Thus, the ritual attention to the head marks it as socially and

religiously important.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#89:1> The omiero is both an empowering and a cleaning agent; when applied

to the head, it strengthens the spirit that dwells of the mixture, entwined

in his hair, often begin to scratch and cause itching Carter recalls: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#90:1> I felt a little estrange scratching my head after Jose [ his

godfather]had spent so much time attending to it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#91:1> He prayed and I scratched; it...it seemed so...so strange to treat

what had been made sacred as something annoying, but my scalp really itched.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#92:1> Later, I said a prayer to my head [ ruling oricha] in thanksgiving

and slept with a white cloth over it.10 </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#93:1> He pays special and prolonged attention to his head; this

attention, focused on his body and the part of it representing his destiny,

lasts through the ritual and beyond.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#94:1> The man attends to his head and thus experiences its cultural

importance in a bodily way. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-012#95:1> This attention to the head, moreover, represents the beginning of

a new cultural pattern.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#96:1> Many culturally prescribed forms of behavior, which specific other

members of the religious community validate and encourage, reiterate the

centrality of the head.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#97:1> People entering Santeria often start their affiliation when they need

healing, and frequently the first ritual they undergo is the <it> rogacion de

la cabeza </it> , in which coconut, water, and cotton are applied to the head

to feed it.
<ICE-USA:W2A-012#98:1> If they eventually undergo initiation and they almost always do (

Rogers 1@73:28-29)--their heads will receive still more attention. </p> </I>
