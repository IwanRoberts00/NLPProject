<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#1:1> The Library of Congress ( LC) has been lending books from its

collection to other libraries since 1902, when Librarian of Congress Herbert

Putnam first established LC " as the nation 's library of last resort." This

year, through its Loan Division, LC will respond to over 50,000 requests from

libraries throughout the world for book loans and article photocopies.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#2:1> This page provides information about our services, what materials are

available for loan, and how to send requests to us.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#3:1> Please feel free to contact us via e-mail at ill@loc.gov with

questions or comments, but do not send Interlibrary Loan requests to this

address. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#4:1> The Library of Congress' collections reflect the broad scope of

its acquisitions over the past 200 years.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#5:1> They amount to over 110,000,000 items and encompass material in all

known languages and in all formats.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#6:1> Almost all printed material is available for loan or copying unless

restricted by copyright or terms of acquisition.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#7:1> <h> New Lower Interlibrary Loan Charges for non-US Libraries</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#8:1> Beginning June 1 the Library of Congress is reducing its

interlibrary loan charges for non-US libraries to

&dollar;24 for book loans and

&dollar;16 for photocopies. Payment must be made by IFLA vouchers or through an OCLC

IFM transaction. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#9:1> The previous cost was

&dollar;37 ( five vouchers) for loans and

&dollar;24 ( three vouchers) for copies.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#10:1> The lower prices are possible because of lower delivery costs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#11:1> LC suspended international lending in 1993 because of high postal

charges and only resumed lending to online requestors in 1996.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#12:1> It resumed accepting mail requests paid with IFLA vouchers in 1998.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#13:1> OCLC users should note that the LC interlibrary loan symbol is

LCL ( not DLC). </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#14:1> <h> Loans to U.S. Libraries</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#15:1> For libraries in the U.S., the Library of Congress serves as a

source for material not available through local, state or regional libraries.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#16:1> Requests are accepted from academic, public, and special libraries

that make their own material available through participation in an

interlibrary loan system.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#17:1> Participation is usually indicated by membership in one of the major

U.S. bibliographic networks ( OCLC, RLIN) or by a listing in the American

Library Directory ( Bowker) or the Directory of Special Libraries and

Information Centers ( Gale).
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#18:1> LC 's policies are complementary to the National Interlibrary Loan

Code for the United States as established by the American Library

Association.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#19:1> <h> Loans to Libraries Outside the U.S.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#20:1> The Library of Congress serves as a primary source for material

published in the United States and secondarily for items published outside

the US and not available from the country of origin.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#21:1> LC 's policies generally follow the procedures set out in the IFLA

Principles and Guidelines for Interlending.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#22:1> For requests submitted from outside the U.S. via OCLC, you must

include the correct charge in the max cost field.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#23:1> For loans, you should put

&dollar;24 IFM; for photocopies, you should put

&dollar;16 IFM.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#24:1> Requests submitted without the correct charges will not be

processed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#25:1> Although the Loan Division mainly accepts requests from libraries

outside the United States that are participating members of either the OCLC

or RLIN bibliographic network, the Division also accepts requests by surface

mail ( not fax) if the request includes the correct number of IFLA vouchers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#26:1> Book loans require 3 vouchers ( valued at US

&dollar;24) and article photocopies require 2 vouchers ( valued at US

&dollar;16). <ICE-USA:W2D-005#27:1> For more information about vouchers, please click here to view

the web page for the IFLA Voucher Scheme.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#28:1> The Library of Congress OCLC symbol for interlibrary loans is LCL;

the RLIN symbol is DCLW.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#29:1> If you are an OCLC or RLIN participating library outside the US,

please refer to your network contact for further instructions.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#30:1> <h> Loan Period</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#31:1> The loan period is 30 days for all libraries, U.S. and non-U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#32:1> A grace period of another 30 days is normaly granted, after sending a

reminder notice that material should be returned soon.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#33:1> Material not returned after 60 days will result in suspension of

borrowing privileges.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#34:1> In addition, it is possible to recall material borrowed on

Interlibrary Loan, when needed for official Library of Congress business.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#35:1> A Recall Notice would be sent in such a case, and the loan period

might be shortened. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#36:1> <h> Shipping from LC</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#37:1> All books for domestic libraries are shipped via Federal Express

next-day delivery when the street address is provided.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#38:1> Otherwise, they are sent via the United Parcel Service.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#39:1> Article photocopies will be sent electronically via the Ariel

document delivery system if an Ariel IP address is included in the request.

</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#40:1> <h> Renewals</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#41:1> Interlibrary Loans may not, ordinarily, be renewed.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#42:1> Final due dates are given on the charge card which accompanies the

requested material.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#43:1> If you feel there are extenuating circumstances, contact the Loan

Division, Circulation Section, at the address below. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#44:1> <h> Lost or Damamged Items</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#45:1> As set forth in the U.S. National Interlibrary Loan Code and the

IFLA Principles and Guidelines for Interlending, the borrowing library

assumes responsibility for the safety of borrowed materials from the time the

material leaves the lending library until it is returned safely.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#46:1> Borrowers should contact the Circulation Section as soon as possible

regarding any concerns about lost or damaged items. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#47:1> <h> Requesting Books, Periodicals, and Newspapers</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#48:1> The Library of Congress provides book loans, periodical article

photocopies, and newspaper microfilm loans when this material is not readily

available from other sources.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#49:1> Not every item in the LC catalog is actually held in the collection,

however, and not everything in the collection can be lent or copied. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#50:1> <h> Verifying a Citation</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#51:1> Before making a request, verify that the item exists and is held

by LC.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#52:1> Requests should be verified through an electronic database or other

standard bibliographic tool, preferably also in the Library of Congress

Online Catalog.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#53:1> The most useful identifiers are online record numbers such as the

Library of Congress control number ( e.g., 9712456), the International

Standard Book Number ( ISBN), or the OCLC record number.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#54:1> Include these, or a citation to a published tool such as the National

Union Catalog, whenever possible. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#55:1> Many recent monographs are represented in the catalog by

Cataloging in Publication ( CIP) records but have not yet received full

cataloging and are not available in the Library 's collections.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#56:1> If the Online Catalog record does not indicate pagination or size,

the item has not been received and processed by LC. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#57:1> When requesting an article from a serial publication, please

match the serial title with the volume number, date of issue, and place of

publication.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#58:1> Be sure to include pagination, title, and author of the article.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#59:1> To request a newspaper, be sure to include the dates and place of

publication. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#60:1> <h> Material in Micro Formats</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#61:1> Many items in microfilm and microfiche formats are available for

loan.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#62:1> Although LC does not circulate original copies of items published

before 1801, genealogies, or bound periodicals, this material will circulate

as microfilm. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#63:1> <h> Dissertations</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#64:1> LC does not circulate dissertations on microfilm that are readily

available from a commercial source. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#65:1> <h> Requesting Periodical Articles</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#66:1> The Library of Congress maintains a collection of over 900,000

serial titles, including bound volumes, loose issues, and microfilm.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#67:1> Periodicals, whether bound or unbound, are non-circulating, but the

Loan Division makes every effort to send gratis photocopies of individual

articles when requested on interlibrary loan.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#68:1> Photocopied material is mailed first class or sent by Ariel when the

IP address is provided. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#69:1> <h> Requesting Newspapers on Microfilm</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#70:1> The Library of Congress maintains one of the largest and most

comprehensive newspaper collections in the world, comprised not only of the

major papers published in all 50 states and territories of the United States,

but also those published in other countries of the world and their internal

states and subdivisions that have existed during the past three centuries.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#71:1> Almost all of the more than 500,000 reels of newspaper microfilm held

by the Newspaper & Current Periodical, European, Asian, and African & Middle

Eastern Divisions are available for interlibrary loan.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#72:1> Only newspapers that have been microfilmed are available for

loan.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#73:1> <h> How to Tell if LC Holds a Circulating Newspaper on Microfilm</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#74:1> In the LC cataloging record, check the call number ( 050) field

in the bibliographic record.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#75:1> If the word " newspaper" appears here, or " newspaper" plus a number

smaller than 5000 ( Newspaper 3450), the film should be available for loan.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#76:1> If the call number field includes an X ( Newspaper 8066-X), or a

number larger than 5000 ( Newspaper 7686), then the newspaper is not on

microfilm and is non-circulating.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#77:1> Up to 6 reels may be borrowed per patron at one time.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#78:1> Please be sure to include a place of publication and the exact dates

that you are requesting.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#79:1> Loan Division is unable to provide copies of specific articles

from non-circulating microfilmed or bound newspapers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-005#80:1> Requests for photocopies from non-circulating newspapers should be

sent directly to the library. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-005#83:1> In addition to its general book and periodical collection, the

Library of Congress maintains a number of specialized collections, some large

enough to be custodial units in their own right, some small enough to be

subsets of other collections.

borrowing or requesting copies of specific items. </p>
