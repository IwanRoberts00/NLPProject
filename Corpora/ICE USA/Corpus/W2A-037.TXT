<ICE-USA:W2A-037#1:1> <H> Abstract</h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#2:1> This paper presents the findings of an empirical study into two

organizations' experiences with the adoption and use of CASE tools over time.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#3:1>
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#4:1> Using a grounded theory research approach, the study characterizes the

organizations' experiences in terms of processes of incremental or radical

organizational change.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#5:1> These findings are used to develop a theoretical framework for

conceptualizing the organizational issues around the adoption and use of

these tools--issues that have been largely missing from contemporary

discussions of CASE tools.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#6:1> The paper thus has important implications for research and practice.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#7:1> Specifically, the framework and findings suggest that in order to

account for the experiences and outcomes associated with CASE tools,

researchers should consider the social context of systems development, the

intentions and actions of key players, and the implementation process

followed by the organization.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#8:1> Similarly, the paper suggests that practitioners will be better able

to manage their organizations' experiences with CASE tools, if they

understand that such implementations involve a process of organizational

change over time, and not merely the installation of a new technology.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#9:1> <H> Introduction</h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#10:1> CASE ( computer-aided software engineering) tools have generated

much interest among researchers and practitioners as potential means for

easing the software development and maintenance burden threatening to

overwhelm information systems ( IS) departments.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#11:1> While interest and investment in CASE tools has been rising steadily,

actual experiences with tools have exhibited more ambiguity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#12:1> For example, while some studies report improvements in productivity

from the use of CASE tools ( Banker and Kauffman, 1991; Necco, Tsai and

Holgeson, 1989; Norman and Nunamaker, 1988; Swanson, McComb, Smith, and

McCubbrey, 1991), others find that the expected productivity gains are

elusive ( Card, McGarry, and Page, 1987; Yellen,1990) or eclipsed by lack of

adequate training and experience, developer resistance, and increased design

and testing time ( Norman, Corbitt, Butler, and McElroy, 1989; Orlikowski,

1988b, 1989; Vessey, Jarvenpaa, and Tractinsky, 1992).</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#13:1> While these contradictory experiences with CASE tools appear

puzzling and difficult to interpret, the research presented here suggests

that by shifting the focus from specific outcome expectations, we may be able

to make some sense of the apparently inconsistent findings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#14:1> This paper argues that the adoption and use of CASE tools should be

conceptualized as a form of organizational change, and that such a

perspective allows us to anticipate, explain, and evaluate different

experiences and consequences following the introduction of CASE tools in

organizations. To date, there has been no systematic examination or

formulation of the organizational changes around CASE tools.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#15:1> Much of the literature on CASE tools has tended to focus on discrete

outcomes, such as productivity, systems quality, and development costs, while

neglecting the intentions and actions of key players, the process by which

CASE tools are adopted and used, and the organizational context within which

such events occur.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#16:1> Issues of intentions, actions, process, and context around

information technology are not new to the IS field.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#17:1> For example, implementation research has looked at the process

through which technology is introduced ( Ginzberg, 1981; Rogers, 1983), the

interactionist ( Markus, 1983) and reinforcement politics ( George and King,

1991) approaches have examined the role of social context in shaping the

introduction and use of technology, and the structuration perspective (

DeSanctis and Poole, forthcoming; Orlikowski and Robey, 1991) has emphasized

the centrality of players' deliberate, knowledgeable, and reflective action

in shaping and appropriating technology.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#18:1> Yet, contemporary discussions around CASE tools in research,

education, and practice tend to gloss over these issues. In this paper, the

implementation of CASE tools is understood as a specific case of

technology-based organizational change.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#19:1> As such, the core research question is: What are the critical

elements that shape the organizational changes associated with the adoption

and use of CASE tools? In answering this question, I first describe the

empirical findings that emerged from my grounded theory study of two

organizations that implemented CASE tools in their systems development

operations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#20:1> I then develop a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the

findings in terms of three central categories: strategic conduct,

institutional context, and change process.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#21:1> The grounded theory approach was useful here because it allows a

focus on contextual and processual elements as well as the action of key

players associated with organizational change--elements that are often

omitted in IS studies that rely on variance models and cross-sectional,

quantitative data ( Markus and Robey, 1988; Orlikowski and Baroudi, 1991).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#22:1> While the findings of this grounded theory study are detailed and

particularistic, a more general explanation can also be produced from the

results ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Dutton and Dukerich, 1991; Leonard-Barton, 1990).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#23:1> Yin ( 1989a) refers to this technique as " analytic generalization"

to distinguish it from the more typical statistical generalization that

generalizes from a sample to a population.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#24:1> Here the generalization is of theoretical concepts and patterns.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#25:1> I further extend this generalization by combining the inductive

concepts generated by the field study with insights from existing formal

theory, in this case, from the innovation literature ( a strategy recommended

by Glaser and Strauss, 1967).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#26:1> The outcome is a general conceptualization of the organizational

changes associated with adopting and using CASE tools that both contributes

to our research knowledge and informs IS practice.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#27:1> The paper makes three principal contributions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#28:1> First, drawing on the rich data of two organizations' experiences,

the paper generates a grounded understanding of the changes associated with

implementing CASE tools in systems development.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#29:1> This grounded theory is valid empirically " because the

theory-building process is so intimately tied with evidence that it is very

likely that the resultant theory will be consistent with empirical

observation" ( Eisenhardt, 1989, p.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#30:1> 547).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#31:1> While many believe that building theory from a limited number of

cases is susceptible to researchers' preconceptions, Eisenhardt ( 1988)

argues persuasively that the opposite is true.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#32:1> The iterative comparison across sites, methods, evidence, and

literature that characterizes such research leads to a " constant

juxtaposition of conflicting realities [ that] tends to " unfreeze" thinking,

and so the process has the potential to generate theory with less researcher

bias than theory built from incremental studies or armchair, axiomatic

deduction" ( p.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#33:1> 546).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#34:1> Second, the grounded theory developed in this paper adds substantive

content to our understanding of the central role played by individual actors,

their institutional context, and the processes they enact in adopting and

using CASE tools.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#35:1> Such an understanding has been absent from the research and practice

discourses on CASE tools.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#36:1> The approach followed here focuses specifically on developing such an

understanding, thus bringing a fresh set of issues to the already-researched

topic of CASE tools ( Eisenhardt, 1989).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#37:1> Third, the paper integrates a specific grounded theory with the more

formal insights available from the innovation literature, developing a more

general framework that will allow researchers and practitioners to explain,

anticipate, and evaluate various organizational changes associated with the

adoption and use of CASE tools.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#38:1> The paper is structured as follows.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#39:1> The first section describes the research methodology and the two

research sites.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#40:1> The next section presents the research findings, describing the

experiences of each organization in turn.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#41:1> The discussion section follows, integrating the specific concepts and

findings of the field research with insights from the innovation literature

into an analytic framework for conceptualizing CASE tools adoption and use in

organizations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#42:1> The conclusion then assesses the contribution of the research

framework and findings, both for future research and for the management of

CASE tools in organizations.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#43:1> <H> Research Methodology</h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#44:1> The research methodology followed was that of grounded theory (

Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Martin and Turner, 1986; Turner, 1983), with an aim

of generating a descriptive and explanatory theory of the organizational

changes associated with CASE tools rooted in the experiences of specific

systems development operations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#45:1> This approach has been effectively used in organizational research (

Ancona, 1990; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992; Isabella, 1990; Kahn, 1990;

Pettigrew, 1990; Sutton, 1987), and was adopted here for three primary

reasons.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#46:1> First, grounded theory " is an inductive, theory discovery

methodology that allows the researcher to develop a theoretical account of

the general features of a topic while simultaneously grounding the account in

empirical observations or data" ( Martin and Turner, 1986, p.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#47:1> 141).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#48:1> This generative approach seemed particularly useful here given that

no change theory of CASE tools adoption and use has been established to date.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#49:1> While models of information technology implementation do exist (

Ginzberg, 1981; Lucas, 1978; Markus, 1983) these deal largely with the

development stages of IS implementation and focus extensively on user

involvement and user relations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#50:1> As a result, they are less applicable to the issue of organizational

change in general, and to the case of CASE tools adoption and use in

particular.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#51:1> Second, a major premise of grounded theory is that to produce

accurate and useful results, the complexities of the organizational context

have to be incorporated into an understanding of the phenomenon, rather than

be simplified or ignored ( Martin and Turner, 1986; Pettigrew, 1990).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#52:1> As indicated above, a number of theoretical approaches emphasize the

criticality of organizational context in shaping technology use in

organizations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#53:1> Such a conviction also informs this research, and the use of a

grounded theory methodology allowed the inclusion and investigation of this

key organizational element.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#54:1> Third, grounded theory facilitates " the generation of theories

of process, sequence, and change pertaining to organizations, positions, and

social interaction" ( Glaser and Strauss, 1967, p.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#55:1> 114).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#56:1> As indicated above, the change an organization undergoes in adopting

and assimilating CASE tools, and the processes of appropriation and use that

system developers engage in to incorporate the tools in their work lives have

tended to be neglected in the CASE tools literature.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#57:1> A research approach that specifically includes elements of process

and change was thus particularly appropriate here.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#58:1> These three characteristics of grounded theory--inductive,

contextual, and processual--fit with the interpretive rather than positivist

orientation of this research.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#59:1> The focus here is on developing a context-based, process-oriented

description and explanation of the phenomenon, rather than an objective,

static description expressed strictly in terms of causality ( Boland, 1979,

1985; Chua, 1986; Orlikowski and Baroudi, 1991).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#60:1> In the language of Markus and Robey ( 1988) and Mohr ( 1982), the

paper develops a process not a variance theory.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#61:1> Such a theory describes and explains the process of adopting and

using CASE tools in terms of an interaction of contextual conditions,

actions, and consequences, rather than explaining variance using independent

and dependent variables ( Elsbach and Sutton, 1992).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#62:1> This orientation " gives primacy to realism of context and

theoretical and conceptual development as research goals" ( Pettigrew, 1990,

p.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#63:1> 283).</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#64:1> The methodology of grounded theory is iterative, requiring a

steady movement between concept and data, as well as comparative, requiring a

constant comparison across types of evidence to control the conceptual level

and scope of the emerging theory.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#65:1> As Pettigrew ( 1989) notes, this " provides an opportunity to examine

continuous processes in context in order to draw out the significance of

various levels of analysis and thereby reveal the multiple sources of loops

of causation and connectivity so crucial to identifying and explaining

patterns in the process of change" ( p.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#66:1> 14).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#67:1> To facilitate this iteration and comparison, two field sites were

studied and analyzed in turn, a strategy also adopted by Kahn ( 1990).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#68:1> The initial concepts thus emerged in one organizational context, and

were then contrasted, elaborated, and qualified in the other.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#69:1> <H> Site Selection</h>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#70:1> Following Glaser and Strauss' ( 1967) technique of theoretical

sampling, the two organizations were selected for their similarities as well

as their differences.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#71:1> Theoretical sampling requires paying attention to theoretical

relevance and purpose.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#72:1> With respect to relevance, this selection process ensures that the

substantive area addressed--here, the adoption and use of CASE tools--is kept

similar, or as Eisenhardt ( 1988) notes, " is likely to replicate or extend

the emergent theory" ( p.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#73:1> 537).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#74:1> Thus, both organizations chosen for this study had within the past

few years implemented CASE tools into their systems development operations,

and mandated their use on all new systems development work.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#75:1> In addition, the CASE tools themselves, while not identical, were

compatible across the two organizations in that both were life-cycle tools

that integrate the phases of analysis, design, coding, and testing.1 Both

sets of tools provide similar capabilities such as design aids ( e.g., data

flow diagrams), data modeling facilities ( e.g., entity-relationship

modeling), screen and report design utilities, data repositories, code

generators, test data generation, and version control.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#76:1> While the one set of CASE tools are based on the Structured Systems

Design approach ( Yourdon and Constantine, 1978), the other is based on

Information Engineering ( Martin, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c).
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#77:1> Thus, the two sets of CASE tools are philosophically similar, drawing

on the same basic software engineering tenets of functional decomposition,

separation of process and data, and sequential development phases.</p>

<P> <ICE-USA:W2A-037#78:1> Because the purpose of the research was to generate theory

applicable to various organizational contexts and distinguishing different

change processes, differences were sought in organizational conditions such

as the nature and scope of systems development activity and the method of

CASE tools acquisition.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#79:1> As a result, the two companies selected also differ on other

organizational dimensions such as industry, location, size, structure, and

culture.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#80:1> The consulting firm ( SCC)3 is in the software business, developing

information systems for external clients.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#81:1> In 1987, it employed 13,000 consultants and earned

&dollar;600 million in revenues.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#82:1> SCC acquired its CASE tools by developing them in-house.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#83:1> The petro-chemical firm ( PCC) is in the petroleum products business,

having earned

&dollar;6.3 billion in revenues in 1987.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#84:1> It has an internal information systems division, which employs 320

people and which develops and maintains information systems for internal

business units.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#85:1> PCC acquired its CASE tools by purchasing them from an outside

vendor.
<ICE-USA:W2A-037#86:1> These differences in organizational conditions allowed useful

contrasts to be made during data analysis, which challenged and elaborated

the emerging concepts.</p></I>
