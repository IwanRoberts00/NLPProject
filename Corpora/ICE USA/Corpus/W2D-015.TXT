<ICE-USA:W2D-015#1:1> <h> HOW TO FLY RC HELICOPTERS - -
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#2:1> PRE FLIGHT INSTRUCTION</h>

<p> General size rule here is to stick with a heli with a rotor diameter of

no less than 600mm - anything smaller than that is very difficult to control

and next to impossible to learn on.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#3:1> Don't try to learn on a hobby grade micro electric - - they are just

too sensitive and fragile; especially ones with electric tail rotor motors (

as you know by know, I despise electric tail rotors on hobby grade machines).
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#4:1> A 400 size electric is pretty much the smallest you want to go

with.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#5:1> Other than size, your helicopter should have collective pitch and

not be fixed pitch.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#6:1> As you know by now, I believe strongly if you get into hobby grade RC

helicopters, you should start out with a larger good quality kit that has

collective pitch.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#7:1> After all, this hobby is expensive enough, and you don't want to have

to go out and purchase a new helicopter in a few weeks or spend a few hundred

dollars on upgrades after you learn how to hover. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#8:1> Spending a little more money now, will save you lots of money in

the long run - - purchase a RC heli that you can grow with.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#9:1> This means your helicopter will have the potential to perform light to

aggressive aerobatics when set up to do so.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#10:1> When you are learning to fly RC helicopters however, you want to set

your heli up as a RC helicopter trainer. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#11:1> This is accomplished by reducing the collective, throttle range,

and cyclic pitch settings so the helicopter is less sensitive and doesn't

have the large control range that could get you into trouble very quickly.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#12:1> I have actually written an e-book that goes into great detail of

what settings make this possible, how to do it, and why.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#13:1> The examples are given on a Blade 400 RC heli, but can be applied to

larger and different machines as I explain in the e-book. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#14:1> How important is correct setup?
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#15:1> It the single most important aspect of learning how to fly any

collective pitch RC helicopter in my opinion.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#16:1> Here are some general values to get you started, my e-Book goes into

much more detail... </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#17:1> Set your low stick collective pitch in the plus 1 to 2 degree

range - this will give softer landings, and minimize the chance of auguring

your RC heli into the ground.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#18:1> Set half stick collective pitch to around + 4.5 to +5 degrees - - a

nice mid range pitch to hover at for most RC helicopters.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#19:1> Set your high collective pitch to about +6 to +7 degrees - this will

ensure you can't accidentally rocket 30 feet into the air in the blink of an

eye.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#20:1> There are no pitch angles for this because the pitch angles keep

changing depending on your collective angle.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#21:1> The easiest way is to set your cyclic commands to about half of their

full movement range.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#22:1> Look at the swashplate when it is set at the normal range of

movement.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#23:1> Set this movement to about half or 50&percent; of normal travel. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#24:1> Most people will use the dual rate function on their radio for

this.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#25:1> You might find you even want to decrease the movement even more - -

up to 75&percent; less cyclic movement depending on your specific helicopter.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#26:1> Start out with half and on day 3 or 4 of your lessons, you might want

to reduce cyclic travel even more if you find your bird too sensitive. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#27:1> You should also have your flybar weights set quite far out on

your fly bars to help make the cyclic control a little less responsive.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#28:1> Weights further out on the flybars will also help reduce the effects

of wind gusts on your RC chopper. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#29:1> This is very dependent on the helicopter kit and the gyro used.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#30:1> Set tail rotor movement range as per the manufactures instructions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#31:1> Your gyro gain setting will dictate how sensitive your tail rotor

control is.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#32:1> More on this in the gyro setup below.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#33:1> If your radio has a dual rate switch for the tail rotor - a 50&percent;

setting is usually a good starting point for most setups. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#34:1> Before computerized programmable radios, we had to do this with

tricky servo and throttle arm geometry angles to produce a large amount of

throttle movement in the first half of stick movement and a fairly small

amount of throttle movement during the upper half of stick movement.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#35:1> Today things are much easier with programmable throttle/pitch curves.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#36:1> This holds true for electric RC helicopters as well, as you will have

to program the pitch curve and throttle curve to give the correct amount of

power during half stick hover.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#37:1> This is explained during day 2 dynamic engine adjustments. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#38:1> No matter what power option you use, make sure you set it up so

you can turn the engine/motor completely off with your throttle trim in the

low position.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#39:1> Most electric speed controllers simply won't arm ( power up) if the

throttle trim is not set low enough when first turned on.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#40:1> If you are not 100&percent; familiar with your RC Radio, now is the time to

re-read the instructions that came with it.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#41:1> Computerized radios are somewhat complicated and it can take some

time to get everything programmed and sorted out correctly. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#42:1> Ensure all servos are moving in the correct direction and

interacting correctly with your servo reversing switches or swashplate setup

programming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#43:1> For example, if you give a forward cyclic command; make sure your

swash plate tilts forward and not backwards or side ways.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#44:1> Likewise for left and right cyclic when viewing the swash plate from

behind the helicopter - - left stick movement makes the swash plate tilt left

and a right command tilts it to the right.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#45:1> An increase in your throttle stick should show an increase in both

your collective pitch and in your engine/motor speed. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#46:1> The instructions that come with the heli kit should indicate what

direction your servo arm moves when given a left or right command.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#47:1> Seeing that tail rotor servo placement, main rotor and tail rotor

rotational direction, and if the tail rotor is on the left or right side of

the tail boom all play a roll in determining direction, there are many

different set up possibilities.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#48:1> The easiest way to confirm if you have things set up correctly is to

make sure if you give a right tail rotor command, you see the pitch of the

tail rotor change so it blows or thrusts the tail boom to the left ( nose of

the helicopter turns right) and vice-versa for a left command. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#49:1> There are two things you want to confirm with your gyro set up.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#50:1> First off, is it correcting the tail rotor in proper direction?
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#51:1> If you hold your helicopter by the rotor head and swing the nose to

the right ( rotating your helicopter clockwise), you should see the tail

rotor servo move to give a left tail rotor command just as if you were giving

a left stick command; vice versa for a sudden left ( counter clockwise)

helicopter yaw movement.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#52:1> If the movements are opposite of what they should be, simply use the

gyro reverse switch to change the direction of correction and re-test. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#53:1> The next gyro function you want to set is the amount of " Gain"

or how sensitive the gyro is.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#54:1> Most RC helicopter kits and gyro instructions will have starting

point recommendations and you should follow those.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#55:1> As a general rule, I usually set the gain to about 55-65&percent; as a good

starting point ( but it depends on the gyro/heli combination).
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#56:1> If you have a remote gain feature with your gyro ( the ability to

change the sensitivity of the gyro from your radio) you could set one value

at 55&percent; and the other at 65&percent; for example and see which preforms best by the

simple flick of a toggle switch. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#57:1> You most likely have already done this if you followed your

helicopter building instructions, but now is a good time to recheck the

center of gravity or " CG" for short.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#58:1> The CG is simply the balance point of the helicopter.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#59:1> You will always want your CG at or a little forward of the main rotor

mast.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#60:1> How do you check it?
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#61:1> Simply hold your helicopter by the flybar so the helicopter can pivot

forward and backwards.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#62:1> If your helicopter is level or tilts a bit forward that is perfect.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#63:1> If it tilts backwards, that is the last thing you want when learning.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#64:1> Move your receiver battery pack a bit closer to the nose of the

helicopter and recheck. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#65:1> If you have an electric RC heli, you can move your main battery

pack a little more forward or backward to get the CG in the sweet spot.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#66:1> It is generally common practice to check your CG if you have a fuel

powered model with the fuel tank half full and adjust with the receiver

battery pack as required. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#67:1> All RC helicopter rotor blades ( main and tail) are held onto the

blade grips with a single bolt and lock nut.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#68:1> The tightness of this bolt and nut are very important and I have seen

many people ( newbies and seasoned fliers alike) under or over tighten them -

I was guilty of this for years myself. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#69:1> There are several methods to check if you have your rotor blades

tightened the correct amount - this is the method I like the best.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#70:1> For your main rotor blades, simply hold your helicopter sideways to

the ground with the main rotor blades out straight from the blade holders,

horizontal to the ground.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#71:1> The bolts should be tight enough so the blades don't pivot in the

blade holders downwards by the pull of gravity but they should be loose

enough to move if you shake your heli up and down. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#72:1> Now, I should mention as the birds get larger, you have to

tighten the blade bolts more as the blades have much more mass.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#73:1> Once over 700mm blade size ( not rotor diameter), blade bolt torque

is so important and on big blades like these, you generally have to tighten

the bolts so tight, the blades won't move when the heli is held sideways and

shaken.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#74:1> If large blades like this are too loose, they will lag during spool

up or down.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#75:1> Depending on both mass of the blade and the amount of lag, this lag

could shake your bird apart due to the effects of ground resonance and an out

of balance head caused by blade lead/lag. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#76:1> Here is a pretty good video I found of ground resonance on a full

size Chinook helicopter.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#77:1> Our RC birds will shake faster during ground resonance since the

rotor speeds are higher but they shake the exact same way ( don't ask how I

learned this).
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#78:1> Tail rotor blade bolt adjustment is very much the same.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#79:1> They should be tightened just enough to prevent the tail rotor blades

from pivoting down in the blade holder due to the pull of gravity on them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#80:1> Same on large or small birds since tail rotor mass is always very

low. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#81:1> As I have indicated several times in this web site, RC

helicopters are potentially the most dangerous of all RC vehicles.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#82:1> When you are first learning how to fly RC helicopters, specifically

learning how to hover, the danger is not as great as it is be when you are

starting to fly around.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#83:1> After all, the heli will ( hopefully) be staying in one fixed

location close to the ground more or less.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#84:1> The reason you want to think a bit about safety right now on day 1 is

to determine where you will be going for your first hover attempts during

days 3 and 4.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#85:1> The last thing you want is a location with many people around.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#86:1> This is not only dangerous for them, but very distracting for you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#87:1> You should go out alone or with one person maximum to assist you.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#88:1> If you learn at a RC helicopter club, they should have a practice

area away from the main flight line.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#89:1> You will need maximum concentration - - distractions are the worst!

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-015#90:1> This is not the time to have all your buds come out and watch

your first baby steps.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#91:1> Also leave Fido at home - - man have I heard some pretty messy horror

stories about dogs going after RC helicopters.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#92:1> Almost happened to me once with an off leash dog, but that is another

story.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#93:1> You will need a nice large open area free of any obstacles.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#94:1> Clean dust free pavement or packed snow/ice are the best choices (

more on this during Day 3).
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#95:1> When learning to hover, you won't need as much room as when you start

flying circuits, but you should have an area of at least 20m by 20m ( 60 feet

by 60 feet) the bigger the better.
<ICE-USA:W2D-015#96:1> Once you start flying circuits you will need much more room. </p>
