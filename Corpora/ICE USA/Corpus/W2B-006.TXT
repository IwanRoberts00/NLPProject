<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#1:1> The middle-aged woman consented to talk only after she was assured

that her anonymity would be guaranteed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#2:1> Even then she feared giving certain details, thinking that any fact

might link her to her illegal immigrant status.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#3:1> Maria, as we will call her, sadly recalled her life in Mexico, where

she lived in a small agricultural town with her husband and son.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#4:1> The three lived in a small one-room hut.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#5:1> " We had no running water and no electricity," said Maria.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#6:1> " The roof leaked and we didn't even have a bathroom."
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#7:1> Maria 's husband, a field worker, was out of work due to the rainy

season.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#8:1> " My son was very ill, and we barely had enough to eat," said Maria.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#9:1> It was for these reasons that Maria and her husband made the long,

arduous trek to California, in search of the American Dream.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#10:1> Maria couldn't have known what awaited her when she arrived.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#11:1> " They say we come here, have our children, and abuse the system,"

said Maria.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#12:1> " But I haven't done that."
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#13:1> She speaks of what she calls " a persecution of Latinos."
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#14:1> She is referring, of course, to California 's Proposition 187, a plank

in the reelection campaign of Governor Pete Wilson, which passed by a 3-2

margin, or by 59 percent of the voters, on November 8, 1994. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#15:1> Proposition 187, also known as the Save our State Initiative, or

S.O.S., would ban nonemergency health care, schooling, and other social

services for illegal immigrants.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#16:1> It would also require police, school, and hospital officials to

report suspected illegal immigrants to the federal Immigration and

Naturalization Service.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#17:1> It has currently been blocked by U.S. District Judge Mariana

Pfaelzer, who issued a preliminary injunction on December 14, 1994. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#18:1> The enforcement of the ban on higher education for illegal

immigrants was also recently barred by a superior court judge.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#19:1> That means that the increased penalty for making, selling, or using

false immigration documents is the only aspect of Proposition 187 that is

currently enforceable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#20:1> The passing of Proposition 187, however, not only affects Maria

because she is an illegal immigrant but also affects her two children.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#21:1> Before 187 passed, Maria 's four-year-old son was diagnosed with a

severe case of swollen glands.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#22:1> So severe were his medical problems that he required surgery.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#23:1> " After Prop 187 passed, I didn't know if I should still take my son

in for the operation," said Maria.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#24:1> " I couldn't sleep at night, I was under so much stress.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#25:1> I kept thinking that even though Prop 187 isn't in effect now that

they would be able to use the information [ provided on the forms] against me

later when it did go into effect." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#26:1> According to Nora Roman, a registered nurse at San Francisco

General Hospital, this fear is not uncommon.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#27:1> " Proposition 187 has had chilling effects because people know that

if it is upheld by the courts, the information they have shared with their

health care service providers will no longer be confidential," said Roman.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#28:1> The job of the California health care worker has become increasingly

difficult since the passage of Prop. 187, according to Roman.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#29:1> " People are so afraid, that they are not coming in for preventive

care," said Roman.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#30:1> " They are waiting until they are so sick they have no choice but to

come in, and this means that they require more medical assistance." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#31:1> The facts, however, indicate that the health-care system is

greatly overburdened by growing costs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#32:1> The cost of providing free services to illegal immigrants in 1992 (

the most recent year for which complete statistics are available) was 1,800

percent higher than the average of the costs over the previous five years,

according to California 's Department of Health Services. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#33:1> Opponents of Proposition 187 argue that the increased public

health care costs due to untreated illnesses will far exceed the money that

S.O.S. would save California if enforced.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#34:1> In addition, they contend that the social damage created by an

increase in juvenile delinquency and illiteracy are far too costly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#35:1> The most controversial aspect of Prop. 187 has been its denial of

basic education to illegal immigrant children.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#36:1> In 1982, a Texas statute that would have denied the children of

illegal immigrants access to elementary and high school education was struck

down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#37:1> In the decision for Plyer v. Doe, Justice William J. Brennan wrote: "

The children . . . can affect neither their own conduct nor their own status . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#38:1> Visiting condemnation on . . . an infant . . . is contrary to the

basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship

to individual responsibility or wrongdoing. . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#39:1> Penalizing [ them for] a legal characteristic over which children can

have little control . . . is an ineffectual-as well as unjust-way of

deterring the parent." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#40:1> He added that an education was necessary to sustain " our

political and cultural heritage."
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#41:1> The inability to read and write imposes a " lifelong penalty and

stigma" that " denies the means to absorb the values and skills on which our

social order rests," Brennan wrote.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#42:1> Lofty rhetoric aside, the discussion always returns to the issue of

cost.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#43:1> According to Texas State Senator Eddie Lucio, Jr., few people are

opposed to the idea of educating the children of illegal immigrants, but the

state needs help paying for it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#44:1> " We're just 'reying that Congress should provide financial

assistance," said Lucio. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#45:1> Rick Oltman, chairman of Yes on 187 and the S.O.S. Committee,

believes children are little more than political pawns for the anti-187

movement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#46:1> " Name one social change that you try to make that doesn't affect

children," said Oltman.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#47:1> " The opponents of Prop 187 are simply using children as an emotional

weapon.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#48:1> It is the citizens' children that are being hurt by overburdened

classrooms." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#49:1> According to Laura Alvarenga, executive assistant to the

superintendent of schools in San Francisco, Oltman 's position is based on

incorrect premises.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#50:1> " What these people don't understand is that if Proposition 187 is

upheld, schools will lose funding, both from the state and federal

government."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#51:1> None of these arguments seems to appease Maria.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#52:1> Her personal experiences have led her to believe that she must keep

her children out of school in order to protect them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#53:1> " I was buying groceries one day with my two-year-old daughter, when

she was stopped by an older man who shoved her aside," said Maria.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#54:1> " I think he threw her aside because she is dark, because she is

Mexican.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#55:1> I don't speak English and he didn't speak Spanish, but the language

of hatred was clearly understood."
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#56:1> " It is not only us who are affected by this hatred; our children are

also being affected.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#57:1> We would like to send them to school but because of Proposition 187,

that no longer seems possible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#58:1> I fear for their safety," said Maria.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#59:1> Proposition 187 has struck fear not only in Maria 's heart but in

the hearts of all Hispanic immigrants-legal and illegal-who live near the

U.S.-Mexico border or in Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#60:1> The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates

that 3.4 million illegal immigrants were in the United States in 1992, and

that 80 percent of them were in California, Texas, and Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#61:1> With the help of determined lobbyists, anti-immigrant sentiments are

spreading beyond these three key states.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#62:1> " Proposition 187 was only the first step in dealing with the illegal

immigrant issue in the United States," said Oltman.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#63:1> " We are hoping to stir national awareness of this issue.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#64:1> We want them not only to talk about illegal immigration but to start

deportation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#65:1> Not only in California but in the entire country." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#66:1> According to Texas State Senator Lucio, it is expensive and

pointless to try to eliminate illegal immigraton.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#67:1> He suggests that the federal government has the obligation to pay for

the services provided to illegal immigrants or " at the very least give tax

breaks to the people who live along the border."
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#68:1> He argues that " any other debate can only conjure up hate and fear,

and ultimately will not lead to a real solution."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#69:1> Since its passage by the citizens of California, several states,

such as Arizona, Washington, Oregon, and Florida, have begun to consider

similar measures.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#70:1> There have also been 32 separate pieces of legislation presented to

the federal government relating to illegal immigration.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#71:1> " We're se 'reng a message to the federal government that says we

won't stand for our towns to be overrun with illegal aliens while Americans

go hungry," said Enos Schera, vice president of Citizens of Dade County

United, an organization that is lobbying for a measure similar to Proposition

187 in Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#72:1> " There has been an over-infusion of Cubans in our state," he

continued.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#73:1> " They are eradicating our language and our culture.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#74:1> They are [ also] degrading the quality of our children 's education."
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#75:1> " Americans think this way because they believe what they are told,"

said Clara Luz Navarro, an outreach worker for the Coalition for Immigrant

and Refugee Rights and Services.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#76:1> " It is simply a game of politics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#77:1> When there is a governmental deficiency in management, they seek out

a sacrificial lamb, and unfortunately in this case it is us [

Hispanics]."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#78:1> Other 187 opponents also cite emotional ploys by the government

to divert attention from various national ills.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#79:1> " The federal government is unable to solve the nation 's problems, so

they have created anti-immigrant sentiments," said Franklin Chavez, director

of the Immigration Latina Foundation in Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#80:1> The federal government " lacks the charisma and foresight to solve

the problems, so they get patriotic feelings stirring in people who have

third- and fourth-generation American roots.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#81:1> These people are told they will not be taxed more if we can cut

social service, health care, and education costs. . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#82:1> They are told that they are protecting the American Dream, and they

can't prove this with action, so they point fingers. at the immigrants,

saying that they are the ones destroying it."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#83:1> President Clinton made a

&dollar;1 billion federal commitment in his proposed 1996 budget to strengthen

immigration control enforcement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#84:1> Of this amount, an increase of

&dollar;370 million was budgeted for the states that have incurred the greatest

expenses relating to illegal aliens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#85:1> Border control, enforcement, and deportation of illegal immigrants

were also earmarked for a funding increase of 27 percent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#86:1> In response to growing anti-illegal immigrant sentiments, House

Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, recently indicated that he will move toward

nationalizing certain elements of California 's Proposition 187.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#87:1> The law Gingrich supports would duplicate a law passed by the House

in early February, which limits Congress' ability to impose requirements on

the states without taking financial responsibility.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#88:1> House Republicans are discussing a similar law that would require the

federal government to either stop mandating that the states provide social

services to illegal immigrants or start paying for the costs incurred by

these mandates.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#89:1> " We don't need something like this in Florida," said Chavez.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#90:1> " We are talking about basic human rights.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#91:1> We are not in the Gestapo.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#92:1> " Schera counters: " The only thing that is inhumane is when illegal

aliens make it harder for Americans that are here.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#93:1> If you enter illegally, you are not entitled to anything," he argues.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#94:1> " The incompetence of the federal government and INS officials

shouldn't fall on the taxpayers." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#95:1> According to Schera, a proposition similar to 187 would pass with

no problem in the state of Florida.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#96:1> " In Dade County there are 1,500 jobless, homeless Americans, and

we're 'ready to say enough is enough." In Arizona also, immigration is a

touchy issue.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#97:1> In January, 19,426 suspected illegal immigrants were arrested in

Tucson.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#98:1> This figure is up from 9,903 last January.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#99:1> Don F. Barrington is leading the movement in Arizona.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#100:1> His solution to the immigration crisis is a national 187 campaign.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#101:1> Barrington 's ideas are continuing to gain popularity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#102:1> According to Judith Gruber, a professor of political science at the

University of California at Berkeley, the nation 's anti-immigrant mood could

possibly have an effect on the presidential race.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#103:1> " It is certainly a hot-button issue in certain states," said

Gruber.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#104:1> " The illegal immigration issue has struck deep emotional chords in

particular key states." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-006#105:1> Gingrich has gone as far as saying that California Governor Pete

Wilson, one of the major backers of Proposition 187, would make a " very

formidable" GOP presidential candidate, because it is believed by political

pundits that Proposition 187 contributed heavily to Wilson 's successful

campaign for reelection in November 1994.
<ICE-USA:W2B-006#106:1> Historically, feelings toward immigration have fluctuated with the

economy.</p> </I>
