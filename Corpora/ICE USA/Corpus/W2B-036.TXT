<ICE-USA:W2B-036#1:1> Federal budget cuts may slash everything from supercomputers to atom

smashers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#2:1> Will they imperil U.S.science?
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#3:1> Two leaders square off.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#4:1> In the waning days of World War II, two weapons conceived,

designed, and constructed by physicists shattered any doubts about the power

of science to change the world.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#5:1> They were, of course, the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and

Nagasaki.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#6:1> Even before then, the development of radar and the like meant that

politicians could no longer dismiss scientists as aloof polymaths engaged in

esoteric pursuits.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#7:1> Since World War II, science is power.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#8:1> Numerous government-sponsored national laboratories have sprung up,

mainly to produce more advanced atomic and hydrogen weapons.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#9:1> Science now means economic prowess too.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#10:1> " On the wisdom with which we bring science to bear in the war

against disease, in the creation of new industries, and in the strengthening

of our armed forces depends...our future as a nation," science adviser

Vannevar Bush argued in his 1945 treatise " The Endless Frontier" His report

led to the formation of the National Science Foundation in 1950 and paved the

way for the glory days of science.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#11:1> In the following decades, the National Institutes of Health, NASA,

the Department of Energy, and other research-intensive organizations were

established.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#12:1> Federal agencies currently lavish

&dollar;34 billion annually on civilian R&D - and pay for the majority of basic

research done at universities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#13:1> Today, science stands at a crossroads.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#14:1> led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republicans in Congress propose

the largest cutback in science and technology spending in 15 years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#15:1> The recent House of Representatives budget resolution promises an

effective 25 to 30 percent cut in civilian science over the next 7 years,

assuming 3 percent inflation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#16:1> A Senate budget proposal is only slightly less harsh.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#17:1> Under the House plan, funding for supercomputers, environmental

satellites, solar energy, and fusion power would all be drastically

curtailed.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#18:1> The Energy and Commerce departments, both of which spend billions on

research, would be abolished.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#19:1> Basic sciences such as physics and chemistry would fare better, but

agencies like the National Institutes of Health still face the possibility of

a 7-year budget freeze.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#20:1> The plans have scientists in an uproar.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#21:1> " In the United States we've built up this unbelievable 've machine,

and we're on the verge of destroyi 'reit, not out of maliciousness but out of

a desire to solve the budget problem," NASA administrator Dan Goldin -

himself a cost-cutter-warned in a speech.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#22:1> " It scares the hell out of me. "
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#23:1> Republicans, of course, argue that their plan is needed to balance

the budget, and say their cuts mostly target bloated " pork-barrel"

technology projects while protecting basic research.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#24:1> The budget battle is just beginning: A final budget probably

won't be set until October.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#25:1> To get the bottom line on the budget, POPUlAR SCIENCE interviewed

two of the leading science experts in Congress: Robert Walker of

Pennsylvania, the new Republican chairman of the House Science Committee; and

Representative George Brown, former chair of the same committee and Walker 's

chief nemesis.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#26:1> REP.ROBERT WALKER:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#27:1> PS: What 's your philosophy of government science funding?
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#28:1> What kind of research should the government pay for, and what should

it avoid?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#29:1> REP.WALKER: I come down heavily on the side of funding basic

university research.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#30:1> The government ought to sponsor basic research that no one else would

be willing to undertake.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#31:1> Secondarily, I support programs only government can do with its kind

of financial resources - the space program being a prime example.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#32:1> But I don't think the government should be involved in

developmental work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#33:1> That is, research involving businesses that have a particular product

in mind.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#34:1> This should be funded with private money.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#35:1> Now if doing basic research leads to some applications, then the

government has some role.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#36:1> The human genome project is a good example.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#37:1> As we do fundamental research on the human genome, we discover

biomedical applications.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#38:1> It 's fine for the government to fund some of these.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#39:1> But the underlying force behind the program ought to be basic

science.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#40:1> PS: How do you draw the line between basic research and

developmental work?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#41:1> REP.WALKER: There is no firm line.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#42:1> But if you're setting up programs t 're have a very quick payoff, my

guess is those have little to do with basic science.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#43:1> The advanced technology program at the Commerce Department is a

prime example.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#44:1> This program 's goal is for government to work with industry with the

express intention of producing a new product.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#45:1> To me, that 's not true R&D.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#46:1> I think technology develops so fast that it is beyond

government 's ability to respond.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#47:1> The marketplace is a far better judge of where technology investment

should go.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#48:1> PS: What do you think about renewable energy?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#49:1> REP.WALKER: I think there are some areas we have underemphasized

in the past that we ought to concentrate on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#50:1> One of the first bills to come out of my committee was the Hydrogen

Future Act.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#51:1> Hydrogen seems to be a potential energy resource with benign

environmental properties.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#52:1> I'm also personally intere 'med in the so-called cold fusion area.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#53:1> It 's not fusion, obviously.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#54:1> But there 's something that 's producing additional heat, and it 's

being found in laboratory after laboratory.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#55:1> No one at this point can explain it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#56:1> The hydrogen bill sets aside some monies to go into highly innovative

research such as this.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#57:1> Now, let 's say that we do the hydrogen research and we find

applications for hydrogen, but hydrogen is still not cost-effective compared

with other power sources.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#58:1> The government shouldn't continue supporting hydrogen simply because

there 's no market for it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#59:1> But this is what happens now at the Department of Energy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#60:1> A number of renewable energy programs there are life-support systems.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#61:1> Like photovoltaics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#62:1> The government is paying researchers to reproduce photovoltaic panels

that it has already done the research on over and over again.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#63:1> PS: Take us several years into the future, and predict what the

science budget will look like.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#64:1> REP.WALKER: At the turn of the century, the science budget will

heavily emphasize basic research.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#65:1> We will have enhanced the ability of universities to do research by

stabilizing government spending and by going to a permanent R&D tax credit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#66:1> This not only will allow companies to deduct internal research from

their taxes, but will encourage industry to collaborate with

universities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#67:1> Overall, I would hope that by the year 2000, R&D becomes a much

greater share of the gross domestic product than it is now.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#68:1> PS: So how much will the government spend on science in the year

2000 under your plan?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#69:1> REP.WALKER: Over the next 5 years, our plan spends

&dollar;111 billion on civilian R&D, somewhat less than what we'd spend if we 'd
continued at current levels.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#70:1> However, basic research is pretty well protected.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#71:1> It actually receives a nominal increase before inflation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#72:1> Where we take the hit is in corporate subsidies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#73:1> In all honesty, I'm not willing to 'my that because people contribute

a lot of money to political campaigns, they ought to get money for projects

that they call " science. "
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#74:1> That 's what I think happens in the Commerce Department 's Advanced

Technology Program.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#75:1> It 's a

&dollar;600 million-a-year program, and our plan totally eliminates it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#76:1> Some of the energy programs are also hit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#77:1> For instance, the conservation program at the Department of Energy

goes from a

&dollar;3.2 billion-to a

&dollar;2.2 billion-a-year program over 7 years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#78:1> PS: What happens to NASA under your plan?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#79:1> REP.WALKER: NASA 's budget actually declines over the next seven

years, but it 's mostly the result of accepting the reforms promised by NASA

administrator Dan Goldin.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#80:1> We also assume an aggressive privatization of the space shuttle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#81:1> We want a private entity to take over the shuttle and launch those

flights that NASA needs, and perhaps also launch the shuttle for profit a

couple of times a year.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#82:1> This will save

&dollar;1.5 billion over 7 years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#83:1> The biggest difference between our NASA budget and the Clinton

administration 's budget is in the Earth Observing System.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#84:1> We cut

&dollar;2.7 billion over 7 years from this [ environmental satellite] program.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#85:1> The savings come in three ways.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#86:1> First of all, we think some of the ground-based data collection is

pork barrel and can be cut back.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#87:1> Second, we believe that by taking advantage of micro-miniaturization,

NASA can use much smaller satellites and save tremendous amounts of money.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#88:1> Finally, we think NASA can derive revenue by selling some of the data

it gathers from its Earth Observing System satellites.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#89:1> PSi is there any possibility that the space station will be

axed?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#90:1> REP.WALKER: No.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#91:1> I support the space station because it represents a major

technological challenge for America.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#92:1> I predict that within a few years the NASA space station will produce

a Nobel Prize, simply because of the uniqueness of the environment there.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#93:1> PS: If the Energy and Commerce departments get cut, as

Republicans propose, what will happen to the scientific functions performed

by those agencies, like weather forecasting?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#94:1> REP.WALKER: If you eliminate these departments, you need to find

a place for valuable agencies like the National Institute of Standards and

Technology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [ both

parts of the Commerce Department].</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#95:1> My own preference is to put together a Department of Science that

would pick up the pieces of the departments of Energy and Commerce.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#96:1> It would also include NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the

Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#97:1> PS: MIT Nobel laureate David Baltimore argues that the budget

cuts will mean that his most talented graduate students won't be able to find

jobs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#98:1> He says the cuts " threaten the very foundation of science in this

country."
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#99:1> What do you say to him?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#100:1> REP.WALKER: I think that 's a total misreading of everything

we're doin 're
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#101:1> In fact, our plan will offer his students greater opportunities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#102:1> Right now the opportunities have been diminishing in large part

because Congress has funded too much pork-barrel science and not enough good,

fundamental science.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#103:1> By changing the mix and getting a greater overall investment in

science, we will assure more science jobs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#104:1> PS: So your plan goes against the recent trend of concentrating

more on research that will have a quick economic payback?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#105:1> REP.WALKER: I think that 's a very dangerous trend.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#106:1> The administration and others who have been moving the National

Science Foundation away from basic research toward applied research are

absolutely wrong.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#107:1> It 's just one more example of science being used for political gain

rather than achievement.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#108:1> PS: We've re 'vehorror stories that the National Weather Service

won't be able to predict weather, or that the Centers for Disease Control

won't be able to track deadly diseases if your budget goes through.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#109:1> Should people be worried?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#110:1> REP.WALKER: I have seen a number of agencies screaming that if

you cut our money or freeze our budget, we are not going to be able to

respond to future needs of society.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#111:1> It 's the typical Washington game where as soon as you talk about

reducing funds at the Interior Department, they say, " Oh, my goodness, we'll 'llhave to shut down the Washington Monument."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#112:1> Yes, researchers and everybody else will have to prioritize.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#113:1> But I would point out that most R&D agencies got dramatic budget

increases during the 1980s.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#114:1> When we started the budget process, we decided that no science

budget by the end of the century should be below where it had been at the

beginning of this decade.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#115:1> I think we've 'veomplished that pretty well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#116:1> REP.GEORGE BROWN:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#117:1> PS: How does your philosophy of government science funding

differ from Robert Walker 's?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#118:1> REP.BROWN: My differences with Mr.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#119:1> Walker involve the value of applied research or technology

development.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#120:1> I give applied research the same degree of importance as basic

research in terms of the future economic development of this country.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#121:1> Mr.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#122:1> Walker doesn't.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#123:1> He calls it corporate welfare and says that this is something that

the private sector should do.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#124:1> And in this he 's wrong.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#125:1> The private sector can't do it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#126:1> They have no economic incentive to do long-term applied research or

technology development.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#127:1> Our international competitors do it, and that 's what is giving

them a competitive advantage over us.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#128:1> PS: What effects would the Republican budget have?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#129:1> REP.BROWN: If the Republican budget is passed in its present

form, it will be destructive of America 's economic future and of the

well-being of our citizens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#130:1> It will be impossible to sustain the rate of economic growth that

this country requires with the reduction in R&D investment that the

Republicans propose.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-036#131:1> A decade ago, the United States was one of the top three

countries in government investment in R&D.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#132:1> We now rank about 20th, according to figures compiled by the

European community.
<ICE-USA:W2B-036#133:1> This steep decline will get steeper if the Republican budget is

passed.</p> </I>
