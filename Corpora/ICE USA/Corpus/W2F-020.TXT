<ICE-USA:W2F-020#1:1> <h> " Gabriel"</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#2:1> <h> by Janet Kuypers</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#3:1> She had lived there, in her fourth floor apartment on the near

north side of the city, for nearly three years.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#4:1> It was an uneventful three years from the outside; Gabriel liked it

that way.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#5:1> She just wanted to live her life: go to work, see her new friends,

have a place to herself. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#6:1> But looking a bit closer, it was easy to see what a wonderful life

she had.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#7:1> Her apartment was impeccable, with Greek statues and glass vases

lining the hallways, modern oil paintings lining her walls.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#8:1> She was working at her career for a little under two years and she had

received two hefty promotions.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#9:1> She served on the board of directors for the headquarters of a

national domestic abuse clinic and single-handedly managed to increase annual

donations in her city by 45&percent;, as well as drastically increase the volunteer

base for their hotline numbers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#10:1> She managed a boyfriend, a man who was willing to put up with her

running around, working overtime for her job, visiting clinics.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#11:1> A man who loved and respected her for her drive.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#12:1> Not bad for a woman almost twenty-five. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#13:1> Yes, life seemed good for Gabriel, she would dine in fine

restaurants, visit the operas and musicals travelling through the city.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#14:1> And she had only been in the city for three years. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#15:1> Eric would wonder what her past was like when he'd hit a 'derve

with her and she would charge off to work, not talking to him for days.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#16:1> She had only lived in the city for three years, and he knew nothing

about her life before then.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#17:1> In the back of his mind, he always thought she was hiding something

from him, keeping a little secret, and sometimes everything Gabriel said made

him believe this secret was real.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#18:1> She told him her parents lived on the other side of the country, and

even though they dated for almost two years there never was talk about

visiting them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#19:1> She never received calls from her old friends.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#20:1> There were no old photographs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#21:1> This would get to Eric sometimes; it would fester inside of him

when he sat down and thought about it, all alone, in his apartment, wondering

when she would be finished with work.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#22:1> And then he'd see h 'd again, and all of his problems would disappear,

and he'd feel 'dke he was in love. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#23:1> One morning he was sitting at her breakfast table, reading her

paper, waiting so they could drive to work.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#24:1> " Hey, they finally got that mob-king guy with some charges they

think will stick." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#25:1> Gabriel minded her business, put her make-up on in the bathroom

mirror, hair-sprayed her short, curly brown hair. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#26:1> " Hey, Gabriel, get a load of this quote," Eric shouted down the

hallway to her from his seat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#27:1> He could just barely see her shadow through the open door to the

bathroom.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#28:1> " 'My client is totally innocent of any charges against him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#29:1> It is the defense 's opinion that Mr. Luccio was framed, given to the

police by the organized crime rings in this city as a decoy,' said Jack

Huntington, defense lawyer for the case.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#30:1> 'Furthermore, the evidence is circumstantial, and weak.' What a joke.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#31:1> I hope this guy doesn't get away with all he 's done.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#32:1> You know, if IÐ" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#33:1> Gabriel stopped hearing his voice when she heard that name.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#34:1> She had heard Luccio over and over again in the news, but Jack.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#35:1> She didn't expect this.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#36:1> Not now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#37:1> It had been so long since she heard that name. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#38:1> But not long enough.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#39:1> Her hands gripped the edge of the ceramic sink, gripping tighter and

tighter until she began to scratch the wood paneling under the sink.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#40:1> Her head hung down, the ends of her hair falling around her face.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#41:1> He lived outside of the city, nearly two hours.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#42:1> Now he was here, maybe ten minutes away from her home, less than a

mile away from where she worked, where she was about to go to. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#43:1> She couldn't let go of the edge of the sink.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#44:1> Eric stopped reading aloud and was already to the sports section, and

in the back of her mind Gabriel was wondering how she could hurt herself so

she wouldn't have to go to work.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#45:1> She would be late already, she had been standing there for over ten

minutes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#46:1> Hurt herself?
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#47:1> What was she thinking?
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#48:1> And she began to regain her senses.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#49:1> She finally picked her head up and looked in the mirror.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#50:1> She wasn't the woman from then, she had to say to herself as she

sneered at her reflection.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#51:1> But all she could see was long, blonde straight hair, a golden glow

from the sun, from the days where she didn't work as often as she did, when

she had a different life. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#52:1> She had to pull on her hair to remind herself that it was short.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#53:1> She pulled it until she almost cried.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#54:1> Then she stopped, straightened her jacket, took a deep breath and

walked out the bathroom door. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#55:1> Eric started to worry.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#56:1> As they car-pooled together to work, Gabriel sat in the passenger

seat, right hand clutching the door handle, left hand grabbing her briefcase,

holding it with a fierce, ferocious grip.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#57:1> But it was a grip that said she was scared, scared of losing that

briefcase, or her favorite teddy bear from the other kids at school, or her

life from a robber in an alley.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#58:1> If nothing else, Eric knew she felt fear.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#59:1> And he didn't know why. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#60:1> He tried to ask her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#61:1> She said she was tired, but tense, an important meeting and a

pounding headache.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#62:1> He knew it was more.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#63:1> She almost shook as she sat in that car, and she began to rock back

and forth, forward and back, ever so slightly, the way a mother rocks her

child to calm her down.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#64:1> It made Eric tense, too.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#65:1> And scared. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#66:1> Work was a blur, a blur of nothingness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#67:1> There was no meeting, the workload was light for a Friday.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#68:1> But at least the headache was there, that wasn't a lie.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#69:1> She hated lying, especially to Eric.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#70:1> But she had no choice, especially now, with Jack lurking somewhere in

the streets out there, winning his cases, wondering if his wife is dead or

not. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#71:1> She never wanted him to know the answer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#72:1> Eric called her a little after four.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#73:1> " Just wanted to check if we were still going to dinner tonight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#74:1> I made the reservations at the new Southwestern place, you said you

wanted to go there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#75:1> Sound good?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#76:1> Gabriel mustered up the strength to respond, and only came up

with, " Sure." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#77:1> " Do you still have the headache, honey?
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#78:1> Do you want to just rent a movie or two and curl up on the couch

tonight?
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#79:1> Whatever you want to do is fine, just let me know." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#80:1> She knew at this point he was doing all he could to make her feel

better.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#81:1> She didn't want to put him through this.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#82:1> He shouldn't have to deal with her like this.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#83:1> She searches for her second wind. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#84:1> " No, Eric, dinner would be fine.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#85:1> We can go straight from work to save the drive.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#86:1> Thanks, too.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#87:1> You really have a knack for making my days better." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#88:1> Eric smiled at the end of the line.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#89:1> And Gabriel could feel it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#90:1> They got off the phone, she finished her work, turned off her

computer, started walking toward the elevator when it finally occurred to

her: Jack might be there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#91:1> She can't go.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#92:1> Even if he 's not there, she could see him on the street, driving

there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#93:1> She just couldn't go. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#94:1> She pressed the button for the elevator.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#95:1> And he could just as easily see me walking out of work, getting in

Eric 's car, she thought.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#96:1> I have to stop thinking like this.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#97:1> This is ludicrous.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#98:1> And he won't be there, he won't see me, because, well, the chances

are so thin, and Hell, it 's a big city.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#99:1> I have to try to relax. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#100:1> But she couldn't.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#101:1> And there was no reason she should have. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#102:1> At the restaurant, they sat on the upper level, near one of the

large Roman columns decorated with ivy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#103:1> She kept looking around one of the columns, because a man three

tables away looked like Jack.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#104:1> It wasn't, but she still had to stare. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#105:1> The meal was delicious, the presentation was impeccable.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#106:1> She was finally starting to relax.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#107:1> The check arrived at the table right as the place began to get

crowded, so Gabriel went to the washroom to freshen up before they left.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#108:1> She walked through the restaurant, feeling comfortable and confident

again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#109:1> She even attracted a smile from a man at another table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#110:1> She walked with confidence and poise.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#111:1> And she loved life again. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#112:1> She walked into the bathroom, straight to the mirror, checking

her hair, her lip stick.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#113:1> She looked strong, not how she looked when she was married.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#114:1> She closed her purse, turned around and headed out the door. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#115:1> That 's when she saw him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#116:1> There he was, Jack, standing right there, waiting for a table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#117:1> He had three other men with him, all in dark suits.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#118:1> She didn't know if they were mob members or firm associates.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#119:1> Or private eyes he hired to find her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#120:1> Dear God, she thought, what could she do now?
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#121:1> She can't get to the table, he'l 'llee her for sure.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#122:1> She can't stare at him, it'l 'llnly draw attention to herself. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#123:1> And then she thinks: " Wait.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#124:1> All I'v 'veeen is the back of him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#125:1> It might not even be him." She took a breath.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#126:1> " It 's probably not even him," she thought, " and I' 'vesat here

worrying about it." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#127:1> Still, she couldn't reassure herself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#128:1> She took a few steps back and waited for him to turn around. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#129:1> A minute passed, or was it a century?, and finally he started to

turn, just as they were about to be led to their table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#130:1> She saw his profile, just a glimpse of his face.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#131:1> It was him, it was Jack, it was the monster she knew from all those

years, the man who made her lose any ounce of innocence or femininity she

ever had.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#132:1> She saw how his chin sloped into his neck, the curve of his nose,

how he combed his hair back, and she knew it was him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#133:1> By the washrooms, she stared at him while he took one step away

from her, closer to the dining room.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#134:1> Then she felt a strong, pulling hand grip her shoulder.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#135:1> Her hair slapped her in the face as she turned around.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#136:1> Her eyes were saucers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#137:1> " The check is paid for.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#138:1> Let 's go," Eric said as he took her jacket from her arm and held it

up for her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#139:1> She slid her arms through the sleeves, Eric pulling the coat over

her shoulders.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#140:1> She stared blankly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#141:1> He guided her out the doors. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#142:1> She asked him if they could stop at a club on the way home and

have a drink or two.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#143:1> They found a little bar, and she instantly ordered drinks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#144:1> They sat for over an hour in the dark club listening to the jazz

band.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#145:1> It looked to Eric like she was trying to lose herself in the

darkness, in the anonymity of the crowded lounge.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#146:1> It worried him more.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#147:1> And still she didn't relax. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#148:1> And she drove on the expressway back from dinner, Eric in the

seat next to her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#149:1> He had noticed she had been tense today, more than she had ever

been; whenever he asked her why she brushed her symptoms off as nothing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#150:1> The radio blared in the car, the car soaring down the four lanes

of open, slick, raw power, and she heard the dee jay recap the evening news.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#151:1> A man died in a car accident, he said, and it was the lawyer

defending the famed mob leader.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#152:1> And then the radio announced his name. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#153:1> And she didn't even have to hear it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#154:1> Time stopped for a moment when the name was spread, Jack, Jack

Huntington, like a disease, over the air waves.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#155:1> Jack, Jack the name crept into her car, she couldn't escape it, like

contaminated water it infiltrated all of her body and she instantly felt

drugged.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#156:1> Time stood still in a horrific silence for Gabriel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#157:1> Hearing that midnight talk show host talk about the tragedy of his

death, she began to reduce speed, without intention.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#158:1> She didn't notice until brights were flashing in her rear view

mirror, cars were speeding around her, horns were honking.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#159:1> She was going 30 miles per hour.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#160:1> She quickly regained herself, turned off the radio, and threw her

foot on the accelerator.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#161:1> Eric sat silent.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#162:1> They had a long drive home ahead of them from the club, and he knew

if he only sat silent that she would eventually talk. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#163:1> While still in the car, ten minutes later, she began to tell him

about Andrea. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#164:1> " Three years ago, when I moved to the city, my name wasn't

Gabriel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#165:1> It was Andrea. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-020#166:1> " Seven years ago, I was a different person.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#167:1> I was a lot more shy, insecure, an eighteen year old in college, not

knowing what I wanted to study.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#168:1> I didn't know what my future was, and I didn't want to have to go

through my life alone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#169:1> My freshman year I met a man in the law school program at school.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#170:1> He asked me out as soon as he met me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#171:1> I was thrilled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-020#172:1> </I>
