<ICE-USA:W2C-004#1:1> <h> Longer records, special jails, 'zebra' plates might be in future

for offenders </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#2:1> If you are caught drinking and driving in the future, you might be

sent to a special prison, be forced to attach a license plate to your vehicle

marking you as a chronic drunk driver and have a record that will haunt you

for a long time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#3:1> The Wisconsin affiliates of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a

national lobbying group with chapters in 48 states, hopes such legislation

will be passed this year to help keep drunk drivers off the highway.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#4:1> " One measure we would like to see passed is the zebra stripe

license plates," said Mardy Meacham, president of the group 's southeastern

Wisconsin chapter.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#5:1> " Drivers caught the second time would be forced to drive with these

plates on their car, marking them as repeat offenders."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#6:1> In addition, Meacham said, her organization wants to see a special

minimum security prison set up for repeat offenders.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#7:1> Such a prison would be tailored to meet the rehabilitation needs of

chronic drunk drivers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#8:1> The organization also is lobbying the state Legislature to pass a

bill that would lower the legal blood alcohol level for a driver who has been

drinking.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#9:1> Under the law, a driver is considered drunk when his or her blood

alcohol level reaches 0.10%.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#10:1> Backers of a tougher s&percent;andard would like the Legislature to pass a

bill lowering the limit to 0.08%.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#11:1> " Right now,&percent;a 169-pound man can have three or four drinks per

hour and still drive," Meacham said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#12:1> " Under the new law, that same person could only have two or three

drinks per hour."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#13:1> <h> Efforts Praised </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#14:1> Mothers Against Drunk Driving has been widely praised by law

enforcement authorities for its efforts to reform drunken driving

statutes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#15:1> " Their efforts have [ had] a tremendous effect," said Lt.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#16:1> Richard Krizan, a 23-year veteran of the Milwaukee County Sheriff 's

Department.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#17:1> " They have made the average Joe more aware."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#18:1> But Krizan said that, as for the repeat offender, " I think it 's

often a case of substance abuse rather than a lack of awareness."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#19:1> Meacham said indications that it is a positive sign that the

incidence of drunken driving has decreased.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#20:1> But the failure of the system to successfully bring repeat offenders

to the curb needs to be addressed, she said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#21:1> " But it 's not only drunk drivers - criminals of all types are

being let out early," she said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#22:1> " Also, in the case of repeat offenders, so little is being done to

rehabilitate."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#23:1> Meacham, whose son was severely injured in a crash in 1983 that

involved a drunken driver, said that many repeat offenders are not identified

as such because of the way the legal system works.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#24:1> " In court, the records presented only go back five years," she

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#25:1> " If you had an offense six years ago, you're treated as a fir 'retime

offender."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#26:1> Meacham said that repeat drunken drivers who are from out of

state are also treated as first-time offenders because their out-of-state

offenses are not part of the court record.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#27:1> <h> Common Sense Urged </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#28:1> With New Year 's Eve upon us, foes of drunken driving want their

sobering message to come through loud and clear.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#29:1> Veteran law enforcement supervisors say that a little common

sense before and during a night of New Year 's Eve revelry can save lives and

money.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#30:1> " Many drunk driving crashes are double-edged tragedies," he

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#31:1> " When the drunk driver sobers up, they have to live with what

they've done."</p>

<p 'veICE-USA:W2C-004#32:1> Officials recommend the designated-driver approach to avoid

getting into a drinking and driving situation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#33:1> " Pick the designated driver before the festivities," Lt.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#34:1> Dennis Drazkowski of the Milwaukee Police Department said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#35:1> Drazkowski is a supervisor of traffic officers and 1st District

patrol officers on the night shift.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#36:1> " Don't think that because it is New Year 's Eve that a copper

will give you a break," he warned.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#37:1> He said that being alert for drunken drivers was something that would

be stressed in roll call.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#38:1> Krizan said that in the past few years, fewer drunken drivers had

been arrested on New Year 's Eve.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#39:1> " I think that sometimes people are so aware that time of the

year, they are more apt to follow the rules," he said.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-004#40:2> <h> A new class of needy</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#41:2> <h> People with assets but no jobs turn to pantries </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#42:2> Waukesha - When Don leaves the Waukesha Food Pantry with his bags

of groceries, the 47-year-old father of three is headed for the most unlikely

of destinations: his 2,000-square-foot house in the tranquil, rolling hills

of this suburban community.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#43:2> The home, with red double doors and a brick front, is set on two

acres of landscape grounds.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#44:2> A swing set is prominent in the spacious back yard.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#45:2> A boat is parked next to the two-car garage.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#46:2> It 's not exactly the first place one would look for clients of

the local food pantry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#47:2> But Don represents some of the changing names and faces of people

in need today - people with substantial assets who have unexpectedly lost

jobs in a faltering economy and are attempting to stave off financial

collapse.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#48:2> Many of them come from the ranks of management.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#49:2> While they are a small percentage of all people using pantries in

Sussex and Waukesha - an estimated 3% to 5% - their numbers are growing, and

food &percent;antry&percent;directors expect to see more of them in coming months.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#50:2> " People have to look at the needy in a different way," said

Cathy Bellovary, director of the Waukesha pantry.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#51:2> " These people are coming in to keep a roof over their heads; it 's a

way to sustain themselves."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#52:2> <h> Family Stress </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#53:2> For Don, who had been the primary breadwinner in his family, a

sense of shame and remorse has driven him to hold on to the family home.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#54:2> He feels he should do whatever he can to keep the family 's situation

from turning worse.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#55:2> " I could sell the house and get a cheaper one," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#56:2> " But my wife doesn't like the idea worth a damn.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#57:2> And my kids would feel terrible - absolutely terrible."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#58:2> The average home in Don 's neighborhood sold for

&dollar;132,000, based on the most recent sales there, according to Kim Hase of

First Realty of Waukesha.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#59:2> Don, who has three teenage children, is concerned that as his

family struggles to stay together during these difficult times, a move would

be too destabilizing for them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#60:2> " The family 's really down on me now.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#61:2> They question why I can't hold a job," Don said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#62:2> " The family 's been letting each other down."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#63:2> He said that he would like to sell his boat, but that he can't

find a buyer.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#64:2> And while he has no significant credit card debt, he doesn't view

credit cards as a solution to his problems.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#65:2> " That would just be more debt to pay," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#66:2> Both Don and his wife are doing what they can to earn money.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#67:2> Don 's wife has taken a full-time job, while her husband seeks

permanent employment.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#68:2> Don is taking most of the jobs that have come his way - including a

newspaper delivery route.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#69:2> However, with the exception of one job that didn't work out for

Don, the combined earnings of Don and his wife are less than the wage Don

earned before his layoff two years ago.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#70:2> Looking back at circumstances that led to his current problems,

Don said he might not have been as frugal as he could have been.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#71:2> He said he regretted a

&dollar;27,000 second mortgage on his home, particularly since he owed only

&dollar;20,000 on his first mortgage.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#72:2> " We had been frugal, but then we were influenced by the ease of

credit in the 1980 's," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#73:2> Asked whether he felt deserving of handouts while others were

homeless and in worse situations, Don said he believed that he had given to

the food pantry as much as he has taken.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#74:2> " The family 's really down on me now.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#75:2> They question why I can't hold a job."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#76:2> <h> Unemployed father </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#77:2> Although many of the newly jobless are reluctant to talk about

their circumstances, Don and a couple from Sussex agreed to be interviewed on

the condition that they be identified by first names only.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#78:2> Both families represent the almost 8.5 million Americans out of

work and searching for jobs made scarce by 17 months of recession.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#79:2> The recession has had an impact on local food pantries, where

directors said they started seeing more of the unemployed from high-paying

jobs as early as February.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#80:2> Their numbers increased over the summer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#81:2> After 23 years with a Waukesha metal manufacturing firm, Don is

one of those white-collar workers who lost a well-paying job when he was laid

off in January 1990.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#82:2> He has been in and out of the job market ever since.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#83:2> This summer, he made his first trip to the Waukesha Food Pantry.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#84:2> He remembers the day mostly by the reaction of his teenage son, who

refused to accompany him, embarrassed by the family 's changing fortunes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#85:2> Sussex residents Rob and Cindy are new to the food pantries, too.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#86:2> Rob was laid off in March from his factory job as an engine

repairman.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#87:2> The couple made their first trip to the Sussex Emergency Food Pantry

two weeks ago, hoping to feed their family of six while holding on to their

five-bedroom house.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#88:2> A pantry worker remembers Cindy crying inconsolably as six bags of

food were filled for her.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#89:2> For similar reasons, both families have decided to hold onto

their homes and try to weather the hard times with the help of charitable

agencies.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#90:2> Neither claims to be blameless for what has happened to them, nor so

they expect the unreserved sympathy of others.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#91:2> Rob, 37, and Cindy, 30, who also have been taking interim jobs

since Rob 's layoff in March, said a neighbor called a local minister to refer

them to the local food pantry.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#92:2> Rob said they didn't qualify for food stamps because of the value

of their assets.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#93:2> But as money got tight they found themselves having to make decisions

such as whether to buy milk for their children, or whether to pay they

utility bills.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#94:2> Rob said he would sell the house if he had to, but he wanted to

try to hold on to it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#95:2> The couple bought the house in 1989 for about

&dollar;87,000. <ICE-USA:W2C-004#96:2> Houses in their neighborhood are selling for about

&dollar;100,000 now, Rob said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#97:2> " Who wants to have to start at ground zero again?" he asked.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#98:2> Cindy said she understood those who might criticize them for

using a food pantry while they still had a roof over their heads and vehicles

in their garage.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#99:2> But, she adds, " they don't know what it 's like."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#100:2> Her husband, his face flushing with anger, remarked: " I'm not 'm

slougher; I'm a w 'mker.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#101:2> This could happen to anyone."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#102:2> <h> Pantries Don't Judge </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#103:2> Directors of the local food pantries agree that the tangible

assets of a family shouldn't determine whether they are provided community

aid.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#104:2> They chafe at the idea that people must become destitute to benefit

from their service.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#105:2> Betty Mindemann has been director of the Sussex Emergency Food

Pantry since 1985.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#106:2> She said the pantry wouldn't turn down anyone 's request.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#107:2> " We don't sit in judgment of anyone.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#108:2> That 's God 's way of doing it.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#109:2> The fact that they' 'rehere is important - it takes a lot for them

just to walk through the door," she said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#110:2> The board of directors of the local pantries support the open

door policy.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#111:2> At both pantries, anyone showing identification of residence may use

the service.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#112:2> Bellovary, director of the Waukesha Food Pantry, noted that many

of the clients who have had good jobs are supporters of pantries and other

charitable agencies and were likely to support them again when they got back

into the job market.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#113:2> They also move back into the job market faster, she said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#114:2> Not all clients of the pantries are on assistance, Mindemann

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#115:2> The pantries also serve the working poor and those " who fall

between the cracks."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#116:2> She said she had one client who lost a job that paid more than

&dollar;50,000 a year and had sought aid at the pantry while he worked three

fast-food jobs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#117:2> She also had a client who owned a

&dollar;200,000 home and used the pantry to sustain his family until he could get

back into the job market.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#118:2> In many cases, families lack the savings to tide them through

tough times, or they have already depleted their savings, Bellovary said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#119:2> " We want to help those people as much as others," Bellovary

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#120:2> " They are all needy."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-004#121:2> She added: " The way I look at it, if we can keep people from

getting destitute, that 's what we 're here for.
<ICE-USA:W2C-004#122:2> My feeling is that we don't want people to get to the point of total

destitution."</p> </I>
