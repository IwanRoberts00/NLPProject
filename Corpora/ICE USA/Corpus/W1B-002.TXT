<ICE-USA:W1B-002#1:1> <h> Dear <@> Lodi,</@></h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#2:1> I finally seem to have found a Sunday afternoon when I can tackle

letter writing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#3:1> Your letter is one I've had difficulty returning to 'vecause I've been

fraught with anxiet 'veround my academic plans, many of which aren't at the

level where I can even articulate them, Whenever I do go through a period of

avid letter writing I know I am in a state of relative emotional stability,

which I seem to have momentarily achieved.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#4:1> Your letter made me realize the issues at stake when you choose a

supervisor - and here that 's really what you're chosing, not so much 'rechool

as a supervisor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#5:1> The fact that I was not able to form a very coherent research proposal

made the choice very difficult-and then I found that I was much more

persuaded by finances than I had expected.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#6:1> Basically, there 's no funding available for me until I've lived In the

UK for t 'vee years ( that 's how the British Academy works) so I'm faced with

working my wa 'mthrough.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#7:1> That pretty much threw out all my choices outside of London Sussex and

Essex, probably my two strongest places.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#8:1> That left me with the choice between Birkbeck and Queen Mary, and I've

pretty much chosen B 'vebeck.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#9:1> Birkbeck caters to " mature" students ( I can't believe that 's me now!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#10:1> ) and my supervisor at the moment ( the Browning editor man) is very

sympathethic and said I don't have to start paying fees until I have the

money, I can just go to all the seminars and work with him without

registering.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#11:1> So I really couldn't turn that down!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#12:1> ( I've had a very disappointi 'verevelation about US Student

Loans...the...the Republicans made the rules about deferring more difficult,

and for all kinds of complicated reasons to do with not being able to enroll

full-time, and being outside the US, I can't fully defer my loans.)
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#13:1> Also, I interviewed at Queen Mary and was not impressed at all with

Ophelia Clarke... there are some good people there, but Queen Mary has the

worst academic reputation of all the Univ. of London colleges, and the

department is very weak in my proposed area of Victorian Poetry.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#14:1> The department at Birkbeck is very exciting, they have very strong

people in theory ( <@> Tim High</@>, we used a book by him in <@> Sadro

Dangelo</@> 's Renaissance seminar, he is a New Historicist, I attended two of

his postgraduate theory seminars and they were excellent), <@> Sakai

Takaki</@>, who writes on theory, there are good interdisciplinary ties with

women 's studies and art history ( there 's a big Pre-Raphaelite woman in the

art history department, and they jointly put out the new Pre-Raphaelite

journal.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#15:1> Then there 's my idol - <@> Ellie Mayer</@>.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#16:1> She 's a big feminist over here, she edits " Women, A Cultural Review"

out of Oxford, and she just wrote " Victorian Poetry" with Routledge.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#17:1> She is what got me excited about Browning.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#18:1> She is on sabbatical next year and is oversubscribed with phd

students, but bascially my goal is to work with her.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#19:1> My current supervisor, <@> Rin Natakathwarphat</@>, says I should be

able to work with her to some degree whatever happens.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#20:1> I can't really figure Roger out... he seems very conservative, but

then quite open-minded, he actually suggested that rather than do RB and D.

Rossetti, I extend my study to a foursome and include Elizabeth Barrett and

Christina, and when I asked about feminist theory he said that such a study

would necessitate that I use feminist theory.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#21:1> To be honest, he seems nice but a bit strange.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#22:1> The sort of person that hasn't done terribly well in his academic

career, hasn't published much, but is friends with people like <@> Liga

Bue</@>; he 's about 50-60, lives in Cambridge and makes the long commute, and

mentioned with obvious excitement his annual summer holiday, walking in the

Lake District with his mother.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#23:1> His office is emaculate, with few books, a tasteful green rug, and

two wicker chairs separated by a comforatable distance, with a little wooden

table next to his chair on which he can place the work of the student with

whom he is meeting.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#24:1> He seems very committed to his students, and very thoughtful about

what his role as a supervisor is.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#25:1> He is not, however, an exciting, dynamic person.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#26:1> So with any luck, I will be able to make a lateral shift to <@> Ellie

Mayer</@> after a year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#27:1> I sat in on two of <@> Mayer 's</@> theory seminars - she was

absolutely wonderful.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#28:1> One on Derrida and one on Kristeva.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#29:1> In my opinion, she is one of those people who is not only a brilliant

writer but a brilliant teacher.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#30:1> She is very skillful and diplomatic in her approach.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#31:1> In the beginning of the session she would ask everyone to contribute

a question or problem from the reading, which seemed to work very well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#32:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#33:1> For the past seven months I have been working full time as a

Personal Assistant with Amnesty International, and that has not allowed me to

do much academic work.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#34:1> I am just starting to look for a part-time job to start in October,

and I really want to find something better than secretarial, since I find

that each secretarial job I have chips away at my self-esteem a little bit

more.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#35:1> I am also concerned to develop a second career possibility since the

chances of landing an academic job are so poor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#36:1> I am going to try to find something in publishing since I have bit of

experience there, but I am not terribly optimistic.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#37:1> I am very aware of getting older and how difficult it is to find work

if you haven't been in a career path.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#38:1> George keeps saying to me I could alway qualify as a solicitor, but I

don't know if I would have it in me to complete another long training after

doing a phd.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#39:1> How on earth do people get sucked in to academics!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#40:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#41:1> I feel very out of what 's happening so if you can suggest any new

books/articles out I'd be grat 'dul.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#42:1> I've enclosed a cl 'veing for a book that reminds me of the book you

were working on last year.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#43:1> I am of course hoping to hear positive news about your tenure

decision.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#44:1> George has bought a flat, so we'll be movi 'llin September.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#45:1> Its nothing spectacular but is quite a step up from our current

bedsit, it will allow us to put up visitors, so if you and Jack are making

your way to London you are certainly welcome to stay with us.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#46:1> I hope everything is well and look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#47:1> P.s.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#48:1> Roger was also very enthusiastic about my Hair paper!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#49:1> Evidently you mentioned it in your reference and he asked me about it

in my interview, and now he keeps bringing it up as a possible dissertation

topic!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#50:1> I am horrified by the thought of spending three years entangled with

Hair in Victorian Poetry, but you never know...</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#51:1> Last I heard from Liz Welsh she was close to having a terme-teach

job teaching composition/ESL at a college in California.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#52:1> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#53:1> <h> Amy</h> </I>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#54:2> If you're still in 'reested in ethnomusicology though, this is the

wrong place to come.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#55:2> Ken switching to Folklore as his PhD major because the ethno-faculty

is not real receptive to his studying American country music & pop music.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#56:2> Also, the ethno. Dept. is kind of like the Russian dept. was at

Oberlin-- still has a good reputation, but the faculty is dwindling.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#57:2> So UCLA is the place to go for ethnomusicology, if you're still at 're
all interested.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#58:2> I keep toying with getting still another master 's degree, since I'm

here at 'm university and all, but in other ways I'll be gla 'llo work again.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#59:2> It 's nice to have a little money, and I actually enjoyed working when

I was at the Newberry of course, that could have been place-specific I guess.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#60:2> By the way, I never got your card, so maybe it 's still somewhere

in your apartment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#61:2> So how come you moved?
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#62:2> Did you get sick of living in Dorchester?
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#63:2> Glad to hear you're stud 'reg Italian?I'd love 'do learn it too.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#64:2> Unfortunatley, I know a lot of people who are getting or got

married, although I guess the only person from Oberlin is Steeeeeeve.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#65:2> I almost got to see him this summer when he & his wife were traveling

cross-country, taking a car his grandfather gave him from Maryland to San

Diego, where they're liv 're.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#66:2> He 's planning to go to med school.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#67:2> He applied to many last year but didn't get in anywhere.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#68:2> He said it 's because he told the interviewers that he didn't have a

life-long dream to become a doctor.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#69:2> Whoops.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#70:2> Well, thank you again for writing and for the addition to my

armadillo collection.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#71:2> I hope you can make the wedding.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#72:2> Give some thought to playing piano and let me know.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#73:2> Glad to hear you like your apartment, even though you seem to want to

make some changes in the other parts of your life.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#74:2> Take care!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#75:2> Write soon! </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#76:2> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#77:2> <h> April</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#78:2> <h> Dear Amy,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#79:2> Here is the music & recording we promised you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#80:2> The tempo on the recording is altered to be at the speed we think

will be best for walking in and out.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#81:2> The arrangement of Hopak on the tape is different from the score, but

it will at least give you an idea.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#82:2> Each piece lasts about 2 minutes with the slower tempo-- we may end

up needing more time, so probably you will have to repeat parts of the

pieces.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#83:2> Anyway, hope these pieces are do-able for you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#84:2> Let us know if there 's any problem, and thanks again for your

willingness to give this a try!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#85:2> </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#86:2> <h> Enjoy your holidays</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#87:2> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#88:2> <h> April</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#89:2> P.S. Promenade is the processional & Hopak the recessional</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#90:2> P.P.S. The songs are also recorded at their original tempos after

the slower ones, since in the slower tempo the sound is kind of

distorted.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#91:2> <h> Dear Amy,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#92:2> Have a wonderful holiday season!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#93:2> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#94:2> Glad to hear you are at least willing to think about playing

piano at our wedding.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#95:2> As far as Morris and I are concerned, you can wear whatever you

want-- no one is going to force you into a ball gown or other heavy-duty

formalwear.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#96:2> The music we would like for the marching in & out of the ceremony is

Mussorgsky 's Picutres at an Exhibition.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#97:2> We are thinking about the first or fifth promenade to march in to,

and HoPak to march out.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#98:2> If you are still interested in playing piano after hearing this, let

me know.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#99:2> We have the piano music & we can Xerox it and mail it to you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#100:2> No pressure, though!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#101:2> Heh, heh.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#102:2> Anyway, planning a wedding is pretty hectic.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#103:2> Luckily we have a cool minister ( Oberlin grad) who pretty much is

letting us do whatever we want with the ceremony.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#104:2> How are you spending your holidays?
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#105:2> Morris & I are going to Chicago for Christmas & New York for New

Year 's.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#106:2> Morris just found out that he passed his Master 's exam, so now he

has an M.A.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#107:2> I will have fulfilled the requirements for mine in 2 more weeks.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#108:2> Can't wait!
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#109:2> Yeah, can't wait to be unemployed.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#110:2> I' 'mapplying for jobs, but it 's pretty slim pickens in the job

market around here.
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#111:2> Are you still thinking of quitting your job?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-002#112:2> Let us know if you are willing to be our wedding pianist and

enjoy your holidays.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#113:2> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-002#114:2> <h> April</h> </I>
