<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#2:1> Kim Sung Wha paused under the noonday sun, straightening his stiff

back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#3:1> Doffing his papale, he ran a sleeve across his forehead and turned to

the sun, swearing at its merciless heat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#4:1> Then turning towards two horse-ridden, chatting lunas twenty yards

away. Protection against the striking canecutters.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#5:1> " I tell you, this is all no good," said Cho in Korean. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#6:1> No answer from Sung Wha.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#7:1> He dipped his body back into the work, the gathering of cane.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#8:1> " Hapai go," as he would say. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#9:1> Others were loading the harvest on wagons. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#10:1> " Look at all those lunas watching over us.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#11:1> Three of them." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#12:1> " Five." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#13:1> " Six," said another. "
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#14:1> Where 's Souza?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#15:1> " Who cares about him?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#16:1> " We should not have come out." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#17:1> " We are doomed." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#18:1> " Anything to get back at those Japanese dogs." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#19:1> " What about the Filipinos?
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#20:1> Are they dogs, too?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#21:1> " Yes, for being with the Japanese." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#22:1> " NO." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#23:1> Sung Wha broke with his silence.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#24:1> " You are wrong.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#25:1> We should not have come out here.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#26:1> Do you know what we are?
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#27:1> We're strik 'reeakers." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#28:1> " Who said that?!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#29:1> " Shut up.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#30:1> Or the luna is going to hit you on the head with his black

snake."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#31:1> " Bastards.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#32:1> Bastards of pigs." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#33:1> " Sung Wha, you better watch yourself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#34:1> This morning you could have </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#35:1> No answer. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#36:1> " Sung Wha-" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#37:1> " We should not be out here." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#38:1> " Don't tell me that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#39:1> Then why are you out here yourself?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#40:1> " Yo" fathah, Mistah Sow, is coming to check on you, see if you

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#41:1> Uncle Sung Wha is reminiscing again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#42:1> And he doesn't even know that </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#43:1> " Tango 576.

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#45:1> " Frickin' drunkard luna.

<ICE-USA:W2F-010#47:1> How come he dunno mine." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#48:1> " That 's you, Sung Wha.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#49:1> What does he want?"
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#50:1> Cho 's eyes tell Sung Wha that he has answered his own question.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#51:1> How can we work when the Japanese and Filipino laborers are striking?

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#52:1> " They're jus 'reike us.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#53:1> amn plantation wants to divide us.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#54:1> But these Koreans, my own countrymen. . .how do I convince them?
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#55:1> And why do they have so many lunas watching us?
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#56:1> So the strikers don't attack us?
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#57:1> Or so we don't run away?
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#58:1> Must they force us to work? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#59:1> " 576! 576!<ICE-USA:W2F-010#> Yes-you! 576, you make too much pilikia, too much

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#63:1> " The horse is restless.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#64:1> Souza strikes its buttocks with his black snake.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#65:1> Sung Wha steps forward, calling, motioning the others to stop work. "

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#66:1> " Me no pilikia.

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#85:1> Holding up his machete-sun ghstening off the blade-Sung Wha takes

a few steps toward the luna. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#86:1> Cho: " Don't be stupid, Sung Wha!<ICE-USA:W2F-010#> Look at all the other

lunas!<ICE-USA:W2F-010#> They have guns!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#87:1> Sung Wha lowers the blade, lowers his eyes, lowers the pride and

dignity he 's so proud of, that strain of power and dignity so

Kumgangsanesque. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#109:1> " You have to watch out," Cho warned Sung Wha as they followed

the others back to work.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#110:1> " The company is singling you out.

<ICE-USA:W2F-010#120:1> The men worked while humming singing a worksong their hearts beating

in syncopation and mindsinthought living in the past.
<ICE-USA:W2F-010#121:1> And brooding: What 's the future now?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-010#122:1> " Ah!<ICE-USA:W2F-010#> This sun is too cruel-beating my back like lashings
