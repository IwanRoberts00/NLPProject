<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#1:1> Melding modern computer technology with a time-proven optical

system makes for an exciting way to explore the heavens.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#2:1> Computerized telescopes have been the hot ticket in recent years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#3:1> Celestron International created the first commercial computerized

Schmidt-Cassegrain in 1987.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#4:1> The Compustar 8 was a pioneering model that could automatically slew

to thousands of objects but only after being precisely polar aligned.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#5:1> A new model from Celestron, capable of finding and tracking targets

without needing to be polar aligned, has been a long time coming.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#6:1> But it is here now--the Ultima 2000 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#7:1> I tested one of the first production models, which was purchased by

mail order from a major national dealer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#8:1> While flashy electronic features grab the initial attention of

buyers, sharp images and a solid mounting make a telescope a pleasure to use

year after year.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#9:1> In its advertising Celestron promises that the optics of its

Schmidt-Cassegrains are " guaranteed to be diffraction limited."
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#10:1> Anything less and stars will look soft and planets will never snap

with sharp detail.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#11:1> At high power, 2nd- and 3rd-magnitude stars showed distinct Airy

disks surrounded by a bright, well-defined first diffraction ring and fainter

second and third rings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#12:1> Diffraction patterns looked smooth and similar on either side of

focus, revealing only a low level of spherical aberration from what appeared

to be a mild zonal error.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#13:1> The optics showed little evidence of surface roughness and no sign of

astigmatism.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#14:1> A crucial test was Mars.<ICE-USA:W2B-037#> Its surface reveals small,

low-contrast details only when viewed with excellent optics.<ICE-USA:W2B-037#> On April

evenings when the 13-arcsecond-diameter disk had the Elysium-Tharsis

hemisphere turned toward Earth, the Ultima clearly showed tiny white spots,

which were likely orographic clouds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#15:1> The residual north polar cap appeared well-defined and surrounded by

the dark belt of polar dune fields.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#16:1> For comparison I also viewed Mars at the same magnification (

roughly 225x) with a 5-inch apochromatic refractor.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#17:1> I expected images through the 8-inch Ultima to be brighter, but, to

my surprise, they also exhibited a shade more contrast and detail.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#18:1> Yes, the refractor was giving near-perfect image quality, but sheer

aperture was winning out, despite the Ultima 's 34 percent ( by diameter)

central obstruction, which degrades image contrast.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#19:1> My ultimate testament to this telescope 's optics is the fact that

I actually used it apart from conducting tests!
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#20:1> On more than one night I just watched Mars for several hours.<ICE-USA:W2B-037#> I

feel these optics fulfill Celestron 's promise of diffraction-limited

performance.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#21:1> The telescope arrived slightly out of collimation, possibly due

to rough handling during shipment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#22:1> Small tweaks to the secondary mirror 's three collimation screws made

all the difference between an acceptable image and one full of sharp

detail.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#23:1> As expected, on freezing nights the telescope optics took about

45 minutes to settle down when brought outdoors.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#24:1> The corrector plate is coated with a single layer of magnesium

fluoride on each surface, and the primary and secondary mirrors have

well-designed baffles to eliminate stray light from the focal plane.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#25:1> I found no glare or internal reflections, even when observing near

the Moon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#26:1> The 7x50 finderscope is of excellent quality.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#27:1> Its polar-alignment reticles were accurate and extremely useful when

I was setting up the telescope for astrophotography.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#28:1> My only complaint with the finder is its mounting bracket: it uses

three screws at the front but only a rubber O-ring at the back.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#29:1> The O-ring allowed too much movement. I found it necessary to tweak

the finder 's alignment almost every night, especially if the telescope had

been pressed into its foam-lined trunk for storage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#30:1> A quick-release, six-screw bracket would be a better choice on a

telescope of this caliber.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#31:1> The internal focusing of the main mirror proved very smooth and

precise.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#32:1> It exhibited none of the mushiness or backlash I've experienced with

 'vee older Schmidt- Cassegrains.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#33:1> The image shift was a slight 20 arcseconds, not enough to pose

problems even when imaging with small CCD chips.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#34:1> <h> <bold> Telescope Mechanics </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#35:1> The Ultima 2000 was quick to set up, lightweight, yet solid.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#36:1> The telescope with its sturdy fork mount weighs only 31 pounds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#37:1> The Ultima 's 18-pound tripod proved extremely rigid and sturdy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#38:1> Its height can be varied by as much as 25 inches.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#39:1> With the legs fully retracted the eyepiece is about 42 inches above

ground level, ideal for comfortable seated viewing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#40:1> With the telescope set up for altazimuth operation and the tripod

placed on a grassy surface, vibrations damped out remarkably quickly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#41:1> There was only about one second of ringing after a sharp rap to the

tube.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#42:1> Removing the rubber crutch tips from the tripod legs reduced this to

1/2 second.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#43:1> Placing a set of Celestron 's Vibration Suppression Pads under the

bare legs reduced the damping time to essentially zero--the telescope was

dead solid, a good reason to use the telescope in altazimuth mode.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#44:1> Placing the telescope on its 12-pound equatorial wedge added about

1/2 second of ringing to all setup combinations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#45:1> These are figures as good as I've seen with any fork 'veunted

Schmidt-Cassegrain.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#46:1> The Ultima has no analog setting circles or mechanical

slow-motion controls since both functions are handled with the telescope 's

electronics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#47:1> Both axes have clutch adjustments that tighten but never fully

lock.<ICE-USA:W2B-037#> Although it 's still possible to manually move the telescope when the

clutches are fully engaged, I found the axes locked sufficiently tight to

prevent slipping when cameras or heavy eyepieces were attached.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#48:1> Each axis has two DC motors.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#49:1> One is for fast slewing ( up to 1O° per second when operated with

fresh batteries) and the slower " find" speed ( 2° per second).
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#50:1> The other motor is for tracking as well as the " center," " guide,"

and " fine guide" speeds, which are 6, 2, and 1/2 times the tracking rate,

respectively.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#51:1> Selecting these rates as the telescope 's default speed is a somewhat

involved process using the computerized menus, which are all accessed and

displayed with the hand controller.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#52:1> There are, however, handy shortcuts.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#53:1> Pressing any of the telescope 's four direction buttons and either the "

up" or " down" button on the controller allows quick access to the other

speeds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#54:1> You can also press and hold a direction button and then press its

opposite button to momentarily slew the scope at a higher speed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#55:1> In addition to the electronic slewing, the Ultima can be aimed

manually without disrupting the computerized operation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#56:1> The telescope 's encoders keep track of where the instrument is

pointed even when it is manually swung around the sky.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#57:1> This is a nice feature, which saves battery power and keeps many of

the telescope 's smart features functional even if the battery power drops too

low to operate the power-hungry slew speeds.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#58:1> How long the internal AA batteries last depends on how much

high-speed slewing you do. If their output drops below 81/2 volts, the "

slew" and " find" speeds give out but the slow-speed motors and

hand-controller display continue to operate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#59:1> ( One of the hand controller 's displays is a useful voltmeter.)
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#60:1> I found that high-speed slewing to a few dozen objects on a warm

night drained the batteries below this threshold level after four or five

nights.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#61:1> To save battery power the light-emitting-diode ( LED) display on

the hand controller can be dimmed or even turned off while the telescope

continues to track.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#62:1> There 's also a " sleep" mode that shuts off the tracking motors but

allows the electronics to continue calculating where the instrument is

pointed as the sky drifts by.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#63:1> Thus the Ultima could be left idling in a permanent observatory where

the user doesn't want to initialize the scope every night or wants to use it

for daytime sightings when reference stars aren't easily located.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#64:1> The Ultima can also be run from any external 12-volt source ( no

AC adapter is supplied).
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#65:1> The batteries proved wonderfully convenient for portable observing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#66:1> They lasted for many weeks' worth of occasional viewing

nights--better than the 24-hour lifetime specified in the manual, but only if

high-speed slewing was kept to a minimum.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#67:1> <h> <bold> Hand-Controller Functions </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#68:1> The compact hand controller serves as a gateway to all of the

telescope 's computerized functions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#69:1> Its LED readout worked well even in subfreezing temperatures.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#70:1> The " menu" button takes you to the top level of each menu, while the "

up" and " down" buttons page through the options.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#71:1> Here is a listing of the main menus and the features they access.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#72:1> <bold> ALIGN </bold> is for performing the initial two-star

initialization, which is necessary for all the automatic slewing and

altazimuth-tracking features to work.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#73:1> No polar alignment is required, nor any inputting of date or

observing location.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#74:1> <bold> TOUR </bold> steps through a database of a dozen or more

objects selected for each month.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#75:1> It 's a nice feature for beginners, though I thought the ordering of

the lists was a little random around the sky.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#76:1> Sometimes selected objects were below the horizon, which might be

confusing to those same beginners.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#77:1> The Ultima does not keep track of where the horizon is relative to

the sky.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#78:1> The manual explains that the software was purposely designed to allow

aiming at any object you want, whether or not it 's visible!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#79:1> <bold> SETUP </bold> is for adjusting various parameters such as

slew speed, altazimuth or equatorial tracking modes ( in either the Northern

or Southern Hemisphere), the speed that information scrolls across the LED

display, backlash compensation, and drive rate ( from a choice of sidereal,

King, lunar, and solar).
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#80:1> All these functions worked well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#81:1> <bold> TIMER </bold> initiates a single-event count-up

stop-watch. There is no alarm feature.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#82:1> <bold> IDENTIFY </bold> displays the identity of any object

currently in the telescope 's field, provided the object is in the computer 's

database.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#83:1> It also allows locating nearby targets from the entire database or

from a user-definable list such as just globular clusters brighter than

magnitude 10.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#84:1> <bold> POSITION </bold> displays the telescope 's current right

ascension and declination or azimuth and altitude.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#85:1> The latter was important when I was setting up the telescope in

equatorial mode since slewing the test telescope to +89.9° put the optical

tube essentially parallel to the fork arms, an important step for polar

alignment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#86:1> <bold> CATALOG </bold> is a powerful menu option. It allows

selecting any object from the Messier, NGC, and Index Catalogs, as well as

selected entries from the ESO and Uppsala galaxy catalogs--a total of

thousands of objects.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#87:1> An intriguing bonus list unique to the Ultima is 661 nonstellar

objects, such as obscure open clusters, starlike planetaries, Palomar

globulars, dwarf galaxies, and Abell galaxy clusters.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#88:1> The otherwise very thorough and complete instruction manual

incorrectly states that a full printout of this list is contained in the

manual.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#89:1> This is too bad since it 's difficult to remember, for example, that

the wonderful planetary nebula Abell is object 103 in this list.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#90:1> To call up Abell 12 you must enter nonstellar object 103.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#91:1> Users can also store the positions of up to 27 personal objects,

either by entering the coordinates or by aiming the telescope at the desired

object and automatically storing the current position.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#92:1> This is a powerful feature.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#93:1> It could even be used to slew back and forth between two fixed

terrestrial objects--bird nests, for example.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#94:1> The Ultima 's computer knows the position of the Sun and planets, but

stewing to them automatically requires inputting the current date each night,

a simple procedure.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#95:1> You can display details for all objects in the database.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#96:1> These include an object 's right ascension and declination, magnitude,

size, constellation, a short but useful description, and the number of the

chart showing the object in <it> Uranometria 2000 </it> or <it> Star Atlas

2000.0 </it> star atlases, a helpful bonus.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#97:1> Pressing the " enter" button while this information is scrolling

across the LED display sends the Ultima slewing at high speed to the

target.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#98:1> For objects far across the sky, I found motorized slewing never

took more than 35 seconds to complete, counting the high-speed move, then the

final slow-speed fine pointing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#99:1> Nearby objects never took less than 15 seconds to find.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#100:1> These figures are nothing to complain about but perhaps are not as

fast as the advertised slew rate of 10° per second would lead you to believe.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#101:1> With the Ultima 's " cord wrap" feature turned off, the telescope

always takes the shortest route to the next object.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#102:1> I was never able to get the telescope tangled up, colliding with

itself, or confused, even when tracking or slewing it through the zenith, or

purposely aiming it at invisible objects below the horizon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#103:1> A noteworthy feature is the Ultima 's quiet slewing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#104:1> The high-speed motors emit a gentle whir.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#105:1> The noisiest function is actually the slower 6x " center" speed, but

even it is hard to heat from more than a few feet away.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#106:1> It 's unlikely this telescope will wake up the neighbor 's dog or star

party members sleeping in a nearby tent.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#107:1> The night can remain quiet and undisturbed. Nice.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-037#108:1> The Ultima I tested had a periodic tracking error of about 35 to

40 arcseconds.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#109:1> The software includes periodic- error correction ( PEC), which

allows you to " train" the drive and reduce the error when doing

long-exposure imaging.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#110:1> The training is not retained when the power is turned off; it must

be performed each night, a decided inconvenience. This was a moot point,

however, since the PEC on the test unit did nor work correctly.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#111:1> When switched on it caused the drive to run intermittently slow and

made it impossible to train the unit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-037#112:1> With the PEC off, the drive 's sidereal rate was accurate and happily

kept objects near the center of a high-power eyepiece all night.</p> </I>
