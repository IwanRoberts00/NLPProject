<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#1:1> <it> A telephone survey was conducted to examine the television

viewing patterns and motivations of 615 respondents.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#2:1> Channel repertoire was operationalized in two ways.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#3:1> Total channel repertoire was defined as the number of channels viewers

watched, using aided recall.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#4:1> Mindful channel repertoire was further defined as those channels

identified by viewers through unaided recall.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#5:1> The findings indicate that total channel repertoire is related to

media and audience factors.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#6:1> Perceived effort, motives for changing channels with a remote control,

and intentionality were significant positive predictors of mindful channel

repertoire. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#7:1> Channel repertoire is the number of available television channels

that viewers choose to watch, typically fewer than a dozen.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#8:1> The operative word is choose, because choice of favored channels is

active rather than passive, especially as the number of possible choices has

increased in recent years.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#9:1> As a result, channel repertoire is one element of the " new media

environment" ( Webster, 1986) that embodies the concept of selectivity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#10:1> There are practical reasons to study channel repertoire.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#11:1> Competitive considerations demand that broadcast and cable channels

have " top of the mind" awareness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#12:1> As compression technologies promise 400-channel cable television

systems, the need for channels to attract loyal viewers increases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#13:1> Auletta ( 1991) outlined the revolutionary impact of channel

fragmentation on the Big Three networks, noting that they could " never

recapture their monopoly"(p. 571). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#14:1> The theoretical implications of channel repertoire are even more

compelling.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#15:1> The portrayal of viewers as passive couch potatoes has been popular

for many years because watching television involves some nonselective

behavior.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#16:1> However, research has demonstrated that viewers have been quite

active when there were only a few viewing choices ( Bechtel, Achelpohl, &

Akers, 1971), and they are still very active in the more current multichannel

environment ( Ferguson, 1990). </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#17:1> <h> <bold> Channel Repertoire </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#18:1> The construct of channel repertoire can be operationalized in at

least three different ways. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#19:1> <it> Channel familiarity </it> is the number of channels with

which a viewer is familiar ( Heeter & Greenberg, 1988).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#20:1> Channel familiarity is assessed by asking respondents to freely

indicate the channels they remember being able to receive ( Greenberg,

Srigley, Baldwin, & Heeter, 1988; Heeter, 1985, 1988).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#21:1> Channel familiarity is not a measure of viewing behavior because

familiarity is not the same as use.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#22:1> Although viewers should be more familiar with the channels they

watch, some viewers may be aware of channels ( especially well publicized

cable channels such as CNN, ESPN, Nickelodeon, and MTV) that they do not

watch.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#23:1> Channel familiarity is most likely related to levels of promotion and

publicity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#24:1> <it> Aided channel repertoire </it> presents a roster of channels

from which a viewing repertoire can be recalled.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#25:1> Aided channel repertoire is probably the most accurate measure of

viewing behavior because it most closely reflects ratings data, although it

may be affected by cable channel alignment stability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#26:1> Thus, aided channel repertoire is useful to media industries and to

researchers interested in accurate measures of audience size and demographic

makeup. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#27:1> <it> Unaided channel repertoire </it> asks respondents to list,

without any prompts, the channels they view regularly.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#28:1> The answers may provide the most valid data of channel repertoire,

but they are susceptible to temporary memory lapse that may cause omission of

salient channels.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#29:1> Greenberg, Heeter, and Lin ( 1988) noted that " unaided recall

provides a smaller set of channels in the channel repertoire of the

individual viewer" ( p. 197).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#30:1> Thus, unaided channel repertoire is the most conservative measure of

viewing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#31:1> It is important to distinguish channel familiarity, aided channel

repertoire, and unaided channel repertoire because the different

operationalizations have different theoretical implications.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#32:1> Channel familiarity is not a measure of viewing behavior but a

measure of channel awareness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#33:1> Although aided channel repertoire is the most accurate measure of

viewing behavior, it does not distinguish between salient channels and less

memorable channels.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#34:1> Aided channel repertoire may include channels that are used only

rarely or as background and without full attention, because they are not top

of mind.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#35:1> Unaided channel repertoire, on the other hand, suggests that exposure

to those channels may be more mindful and frequent because those channels may

be a regular part of television viewing. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#36:1> A primary distinction between aided and unaided channel

repertoire can be traced to the level of audience behavior.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#37:1> Researchers interested in reflections of gross audience behavior

typically find aided channel repertoire measures appropriate because they

most closely reflect ratings data.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#38:1> Although aided channel repertoire is not a clear operationalization

of gross audience behavior, it is useful to macro-level research interests

that focus on media economics, target marketing, and communication policy and

public interest ( Webster & Lichty, 1991). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#39:1> Some media researchers, however, are less interested in gross

exposure to different channels and are more concerned with the audiences

cognitive processing and psychological effects of specific media content.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#40:1> For those purposes, aided channel repertoire is less precise than

unaided channel repertoire because it does not reflect psychological aspects

of the audience, such as attention to, impressions of, or involvement with

television content.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#41:1> This approach focuses more on individual selection of television

content and the psychological processes that influence audience 's cognitive

and emotional reactions to what they view ( Bryant & Zillmann, 1991). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#42:1> Webster and Lichty ( 1991 ) account for these two perspectives in

their model of television viewing behavior.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#43:1> According to their model, there are two general influences on

audience behavior.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#44:1> Structural determinants include media factors, such as the number of

channel options, and audience availability ( i.e., the amount of time

available to watch television).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#45:1> Individual determinants include the needs, tastes, and preferences of

individual audience members.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#46:1> Macro- and micro-level perspectives place different emphases on

different aspects of the model.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#47:1> When researchers are interested in macro- level issues and measures

of overall audience behavior, structural determinants are more important.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#48:1> When researchers are interested in micro-level issues,

individual-level factors become more useful. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#49:1> This article focuses on aided and unaided channel repertoire as

reflections of audience behaviors and builds on past research about viewing

behaviors and channel selection.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#50:1> We used the Webster-Lichty model of television viewing behavior to

predict that media and audience factors would differentially explain aided

and unaided channel repertoires. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#51:1> <h> <bold> Total Channel Repertoire </bold> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#52:1> Total channel repertoire ( TCR) is the number of channels that

viewers remember watching if aided recall is used.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#53:1> Webster and Lichty ( 1991 ) noted that TCR is related to the number

of channels offered.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#54:1> As channel availability increases, so does channel repertoire.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#55:1> But, as the number of channels increases, the proportion of available

channels used decreases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#56:1> What factors should predict total channel repertoire?
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#57:1> A foundation for such prediction was laid by Webster and Lichty 's (

1991 ) model of audience television viewing behavior which points out two

major influences on channel repertoire: media factors and audience

availability. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#58:1> Within the category of media factors, there are two obvious

variables of cable television subscription and remote control device ( RCD)

ownership.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#59:1> Heeter ( 1985) found that TCR is predicted by cable television

subscription.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#60:1> Ferguson ( 1992a) confirmed the influence of cable subscription and

also noted the influence of RCD ownership.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#61:1> Remote control devices are an increasingly important element of the

new media environment ( Ferguson, 1992a; Walker & Bellamy, 1991).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#62:1> In 1990, the penetration of remote control reached 77.0&percent; in U.S.

television households ( Shagrin, 1990), compared to 70.2&percent; for the VCR ( " In

Brief," 1991 ) and 61.2&percent; for cable ( Sheridan, 1991). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#63:1> Within the category of audience availability, there are two

variables of television exposure and channel changing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#64:1> Audience availability usually refers to the number of people

available to watch television.<ICE-USA:W2A-019#> But, it can also refer to the accessibility

of television content.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#65:1> So, higher levels of television viewing and channel changing may make

more channels available to viewers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#66:1> Ainslie ( 1988) reported on " grazing" ( flipping through

channels with remote control devices) as a new way of watching television

that makes more channels available to viewers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#67:1> He found that viewers with remote control devices have significantly

higher TCRs than viewers without RCDs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#68:1> The first hypothesis of the study focuses on TCR: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#69:1> H1: Total channel repertoire will be predicted by ( a) media

factors ( cable subscription and RCD ownership); and ( b) audience

availability ( television exposure and channel changing). </p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#70:1> <h> <bold> Mindful Channel Repertoire </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#71:1> Mindful channel repertoire ( MCR) is the number of channels that

viewers freely recall watching ( i.e., unaided).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#72:1> Mindful channel repertoire is generally smaller than total channel

repertoire ( Greenberg, Heeter, & Lin, 19813).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#73:1> Based on models of free recall in cognitive psychology, MCR indicates

that channels have been accessed frequently, recently, or committed to

long-term memory ( Klatzky, 1980).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#74:1> Mindful channel repertoire also reflects a more active use of

television, because channels are remembered without prompts and are at top of

mind.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#75:1> Thus, viewers are more aware of channels whose programs are actively

processed during exposure ( Bahrick, 1979). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#76:1> It is clear that MCR is influenced by media structure and

audience availability variables.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#77:1> Cable subscription increases channel options, and greater television

exposure increases opportunity to watch different channels.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#78:1> But, because MCR is a micro-level aspect of television viewing, MCR

should also be explained by individual-level factors of the Webster and

Lichty ( 1991) model.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#79:1> In this study, we focused on individual manifestations of audience

activity in addition to media structure and audience availability. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#80:1> Audience activity describes how intentionally and purposely

people select and use media technologies and content.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#81:1> Audience activity has been a central assumption of the uses and

gratifications perspective ( Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#82:1> Audience members are seen as active because they select and use media

content to satisfy specific communication needs.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#83:1> Scholars, however, have expanded understanding of audience activity

by suggesting that audience members are variably active along several

different dimensions ( Blumler,1979; Levy & Windahl, 1984, 1985).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#84:1> Scholars have investigated influences on audience activity ( Levy &

Windahl,1984; Perse,1990a; Rubin & Perse,1987b), outcomes of audience

activity ( Perse,1990b; Rubin & Perse,1987a), and audience activity in the

newer media environment ( Ferguson, 1992a; Levy, 1987; Lin, 1990;

Perse,1990a).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#85:1> From this literature, we selected five variables to examine in this

study: television viewing motives, intentionality, affinity, effort, and

motivations for changing channels. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#86:1> <it> Television viewing motives. </it> Rubin ( 1984) has argued

that television viewing motives are a primary signal of audience activity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#87:1> Ritualistic television use, which is marked by watching to pass time

or out of habit, is a nonselective and less active use of television that

focuses on using television as a medium, not specific content.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#88:1> Instrumental use, on the other hand, reflects selective and purposive

exposure to specific content ( see also Rubin & Perse, 1987b).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#89:1> Instrumental viewing motives, such as viewing to seek information,

entertainment, and excitement, are also related to higher levels of

television exposure ( Rubin,1981, 1983) and exposure to several different

program types, such as news, action-adventure, comedy, documentaries,

magazine shows, drama, serials, sports, talk shows, and game shows (

Rubin,1981,1983; Rubin & Rubin,19@2).1983) and exposure to several different

program types, such as news, action-adventure, comedy, documentaries,

magazine shows, drama, serials, sports, talk.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#90:1> Ritualistic and instrumental viewing motives should be linked

differentially to TCR and MCR.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#91:1> Ritualistic viewing motives are related to higher levels of exposure

to television and exposure to a wide variety of different program types (

Rubin,1981,1983,1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#92:1> So, ritualistic motives might be positively related to TCR.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#93:1> But, ritualistic motives may not be related to awareness of the

channels watched.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#94:1> Heeter ( 1985) reported that many people claimed that they did not

know which channels they watched, " I don't know, I just watch TV" ( p.22).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#95:1> She observed that channel familiarity was negatively linked to

viewing television for habitual reasons.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#96:1> Ritualistic viewing motives should be associated with lower MCR

because ritualistic television use is inattentive to content and accompanied

by distracting activities ( Perse,1990a; Rubin & Perse,1987b). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#97:1> Unlike ritualistic motives, instrumental motives should be linked

to greater awareness of the channels that are watched, because instrumental

use of television is more active and aware.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#98:1> In general, an instrumental use of television is reflected in more

use of program guides to plan viewing, greater planning of time to watch

specific programs, and more thought about program content ( Perse,1990a).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#99:1> The greater planning, effort, and awareness suggests that

instrumental television use would be associated with higher MCR. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#100:1> <it> Intentionality </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#101:1> Intentional media use is planned and purposive.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#102:1> Intentionality is reflected in program guide use ( Gantz & Eastman,

1983) and " making appointments" to watch news ( Levy, 1978) and soap operas

( Lemish, 1985).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#103:1> Intentionality is also associated with greater attention to programs

during exposure ( Rubin, Perse, & Taylor, 1988).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#104:1> Because intentionality is linked to greater awareness of programming

alternatives and to plans to watch specific programs, intentionality should

be associated with greater awareness of the channels that are watched. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#105:1> <it> Affinity. </it> Affinity is another aspect of audience

activity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#106:1> Affinity reflects the importance that viewers place on television

and its content.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#107:1> Affinity has been linked to higher levels of television exposure (

Rubin, 1983), to higher levels of channel changing ( Wenner, 1990), and to a

more active use of television news ( Rubin & Perse, 1987b).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#108:1> Because affinity is related to individual media factors and to

greater television importance, affinity should be linked to higher mindful

channel repertoires. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-019#109:1> <it> Effort. </it> Effort is a goal-directed cognitive activity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#110:1> Cognitive effort directs selective attention to specific aspects of

a situation ( Kahneman, 1973).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#111:1> Effort is reflected in conscious, controlled, and voluntary mental

activity ( Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#112:1> Effort also influences what children learn from print and television

( Salomon & Leigh, 1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-019#113:1> Because effort marks greater attention and awareness, we expect

cognitive effort to be associated with awareness of channels watched. </p>
