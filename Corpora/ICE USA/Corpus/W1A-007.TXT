<ICE-USA:W1A-007#1:1> <h> The Rise and Reconceptualization of Agency in the Twentieth

Century ( Excerpt)</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#2:1> " Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they

please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but

under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the

past.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#3:1> The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on

the brain of the living" ( Johnson, 113).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#4:1> Walter Johnson quotes this passage from Karl Marx 's The Eighteenth

Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte ( 1852) as an illustration of what he considers

his " radical" reconceptualization of the determinants of historical change

and continuity ( Johnson, 113).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#5:1> Johnson contrasts his theory of the importance of people both defined

by and defining their cultural heritage ( Johnson, 119) with what he sees as

New Social History 's overly simplistic allegiance to the concept of "

agency," of people possessing " independent will and volition" and thus

shaping their own history ( Johnson, 115).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#6:1> But, if our reading in this class is representative, it seems that

Johnson may be drawing a false dichotomy and in turn minimizing the crucial

role these historians did play.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#7:1> The twentieth-century historians who assert agency by the subjects

they are investigating do so not in isolation but in explicit recognition of

the cultural limits that constrain their subjects' actions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#8:1> While these historians may differ in terms of whether they put a

greater weight on self-determination or outside forces, they are united in

asserting that the common people of history were generally able to exert at

least some measure of control over their actions and destinies.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#9:1> This newfound respect and appreciation for the lower classes of

society represents a signal contribution of twentieth-century

historiography.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#10:1> It should be obvious that the concept of agency is not new to the

twentieth century.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#11:1> Much past historical writing has adhered to the " great man" theory

of history, that powerful personages like kings, generals, and religious

leaders can alter the course of history through the force of their will and

influence.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#12:1> This attitude can be traced back to the very foundations of the

historical discipline in ancient Greece; historians like Thucydides would

argue that events such as the defeat of the Athenians in Sicily during the

Peloponnesian War, " the greatest action that we know of in Hellenic

history," came about at least in part because of poor decisions by Athenian

generals ( Thucydides, 536-37, 504, 508-11).1 As this quotation about the

Athenian defeat implies, Thucydides and most other early writers of history

held that the fundamental interest of history resided in the study of great

people and events, the workings of government, diplomacy, and warfare, or

what we would now consider political history.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#13:1> This focus on political history carried on through the scientific

historians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ( Burke, 7),

who though they showed interest in institutional history ( Novick, 72)

nevertheless maintained an allegiance to the great men.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#14:1> Classroom discussion of such people should overlook their personal

flaws " for the sake of a great work accomplished and a noble life lived,"

recommended a historian in 1902, and ten years earlier Woodrow Wilson

stressed, " What we need to study in schools is the united effort, the common

thought, of bodies of men; of the men who make public opinion, that is of the

uncritical and conservative rather than of the educated classes" ( Novick,

71).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#15:1> Clearly, among mainstream historians at the beginning of the

twentieth century, there was no room in the historical profession for a study

of the common man, much less an appreciation of his or her free will.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#16:1> In fact, other historiographical developments around this time

period threatened to render the concept of agency even more obsolete.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#17:1> Though Marx may have had a more nuanced ( or inconsistent) view of

historical determinism, if the quotation that begins this paper is any

indication, the Marxist historians that followed him viewed history as

reflecting the inevitable progression of society through different stages of

development towards a communist utopia.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#18:1> Thus, in their interpretation of the French Revolution, " the outcome

( bourgeoisie economic and social hegemony) followed from the origins ( class

conflict between bourgeoisie and aristocracy) in seemingly inexorable

fashion" ( Hunt, 4).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#19:1> Since the actions of the elite are ultimately determined for them by

the progress of history long-term and their relationship to the productive

forces ( Marx 's base/superstructure model) short-term, even the upper classes

and so-called great men in an orthodox Marxist interpretation of history are

at the mercy of outside forces beyond their control.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#20:1> Now, no one has meaningful agency.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#21:1> To reach the state of affairs by the late twentieth century where

the common people of history are seen as having some ability to influence

their fate, historiographical developments would have to occur in which

either a sense of agency is restored to people in power and/or the lives of

the lower classes of society are seen as worthy of study.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#22:1> The first option in fact never became necessary, as scientific

historians and their successors, in opposition to Marxism, continued to

maintain that elites had at least some ability to shape their lives and that

of their society as a whole ( even though, as most historians came to

believe, outside forces also had considerable influence on historical

development).2 But a major shift did occur in regards to the second option,

as the rise to power of the Annales movement in France helped lead to an

acceptance that all fields of human endeavor, and not just political history,

were worthy subjects of research.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#23:1> This increasing attention to social and cultural history naturally

led to closer examination of the lives of the common people.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#24:1> Marc Bloch 's landmark study of medieval Europe was entitled Feudal

Society so it could look broadly at the entire society, at not just feudalism

( the relationships between lords and vassals) but at manorialism as well (

the relationships between lords and serfs) ( Bloch, 239-79).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#25:1> In keeping with the Annales movement, though, Bloch 's goal is " to

analyze and explain a social structure and its unifying principles" ( Bloch,

xix).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#26:1> Any changes to this structure must come slowly, over the long term,

so even though the lives of peasants are now seen as an important

characteristic of that system, individual peasants ( and individual elites)

can play no role in bringing about meaningful change ( for themselves or the

society).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#27:1> David A. Bell sees the 1970 's as producing a fundamental turn

away from the Annales approach of " total history." Discomfort with the

impersonality of quantitative history in looking at the lower classes and

disillusionment with Marxism and its focus on impersonal forces led to an

interest in " history from below," the study of common people and their

ability to shape their own futures separate from what elites or Marxist

doctrine might expect ( Bell, 266-67).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#28:1> This interest in agency among the lower classes came from many sides,

including from historians of the new cultural turn ( who were themselves also

influenced by cultural anthropologists like Clifford Geertz),

microhistorians, and even from historians from the Annales and Marxist

movements.3 New Marxist historians like E.P. Thompson and ( later) Eugene D.

Genovese rejected economic determinism and, though still interested in class

and class struggle, started paying particular attention to the " lived

experience" of the common people ( Novick, 440-42; Bell, 266-67).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#29:1> They accepted and even stressed human agency in the lower classes,

but it was an awareness that human ability to affect their own lives was

itself constrained by the broader society.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#30:1> Thus, E.P. Thompson rejects the common notion that the crowds in

English food riots of the eighteenth century represented an irrational,

unruly mob by instead emphasizing that the members of these crowds had

specific objectives in mind, acted with restraint, and believed their actions

to be legitimate.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#31:1> Nevertheless, these " legitimizing notion[s]" that justified their

actions reflected an acceptance by the lower classes of the old paternalistic

ideas of the proper way grain should be distributed ( Thompson, 78, 76-136).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#32:1> Genovese sees slaves and slaveholders in the antebellum American

South as both accepting the hegemonic world view of paternalism, of belonging

to one " family, white and black," but by doing so slaves accepted the system

of slavery and failed to imagine themselves as a class who could rise up and

overthrow it.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#33:1> Nevertheless, they asserted agency by learning to work within the

system for their own benefit, by creating a culture that merged American and

African influences and by asserting claims of paternalism to acquire rights

and privileges from their masters ( Genovese, 73, 133-49).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#34:1> Historians have certainly raised major qualms about the validity of

Genovese 's concepts of hegemony and paternalism in describing the antebellum

South ( e..g, Johnson, 117), but the key point is that both Thompson and

Genovese held a vision of the lower classes that recognized their ability to

assert agency within constraints.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#35:1> Given the underlying philosophy behind their theoretical

frameworks, Annales and Marxist historians clearly had to recognize the

limits of agency.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#36:1> Thus, the most explicit and emphatic proclamations of the common

person 's ability to shape their own destinies came from the cultural

historians and microhistorians of the 1970 's and later.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#37:1> In her study of the religious piety of medieval European women,

Caroline Bynum stressed her desire to restore the " creativity and dignity"

of her subjects, who demonstrated " a chosen suffering, a chosen excreting,

that washed, fed, and saved the world" ( Bynum, 299, 274).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#38:1> Bynum rejected the traditional interpretations of medieval female

piety that saw these religious women as accepting the misogynistic beliefs of

the dominant male society and who thus " hated their bodies and their

sexuality, we are told, and punished them through fasting and other forms of

self-mutilation" ( Bynum, 208).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#39:1> Rather, she sees these food practices as empowering, allowing these

women to assert their independence in a male-dominated world and even

possessing certain practical advantages ( e.g., avoidance of marriage).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#40:1> Richard White also looks for agency in his examination of the middle

ground of North America between the French and the Algonquians in the

sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; he explicitly identifies his goal as [

placing] Indian peoples at the center of the scene and [ seeking] to

understand the reasons for their actions" ( White, xi).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#41:1> He also finds this exertion of free will, in arguing that the middle

ground that was formed represented a " joint Indian-white creation" in which

neither side predominated ( White, xiv). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#42:1> In stressing these expressions of agency among the common people,

both Bynum and White are reacting against earlier historiography that cast

their subjects as victims of men or European colonizers.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#43:1> But both of them properly recognize the limits of this agency.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#44:1> After all, how free can medieval women be if their only way to avoid

marriage is to starve themselves to death?
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#45:1> Bynum understands that by modern standards, the lives these women

lived would be very undesirable; " no one could wish to return to a society

in which the horrors of leprosy, gangrene, or starvation can be mitigated

only by symbols that glorify pain and sacrifice" ( Bynum, 299).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#46:1> White also explains how the middle ground was only possible in a

society where neither the French nor the Algonquian possessed a material

advantage; when the Americans were able to assert dominance, they crushed the

Indians.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#47:1> Cultural historians may choose to stress the choices their subjects

have, but they still recognize the societal constraints.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#48:1> Such is also the case for microhistorians.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#49:1> Edward Muir, in his introduction to an important collection of

microhistories, makes the focus of such studies clear: " individuals making

choices and developing strategies within the constraints of their own time

and place" ( Muir, viii).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-007#50:1> What Johnson refers to as Marx 's apparently " radical" treatment

of individuals making choices within constraints appears in fact to have

become predominant among modern scholarship.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#51:1> The issue at question is no longer whether agency is limited but

rather which condition ( choice or constraint) will be stressed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#52:1> Timothy Garton Ash 's The File explores the choice between

collaboration and resistance faced by individuals in a totalitarian state.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#53:1> He acknowledges the severe constraints, noting for example that " as

a senior state employee Michaela was certainly obliged to cooperate with the

Stasi" ( Garton Ash, 107) and wondering if Britain would be any different if

it was totalitarian ( Garton Ash, 134).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#54:1> But throughout the book, he stresses how the informers and officials

he interviews did have a choice; he is critical, for example, of the common

Stasi officer defense that he was just doing his job ( Garton Ash, 180).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#55:1> His most extreme case of valuing agency over limitations comes in his

description of the English professor " Smith" 's choice to become an informer:

" The wrong decision, of course, but completely understandable" ( Garton Ash,

137).
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#56:1> But what could Garton Ash reasonably expect?
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#57:1> " Smith," as a means to entrap him into becoming an informer, was

accused by the Stasi of being a spy, which if it led to his expulsion would

have meant his separation from his wife and child.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#58:1> Garton Ash does not examine the likelihood that the Stasi would have

expelled him based on this false accusation, or the degree to which " Smith"

should have known they were bluffing and/or would have followed through with

the implicit threat.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#59:1> And, since informing definitely allowed him to stay with his family,

might that not have been clearly the right decision for him?
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#60:1> Though asserting agency within constraints may have become the

dominant theme of historiography in the twentieth century, clearly

interesting questions on how one balances those factors will remain.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#61:1> And the story of " Smith" demonstrates another important development

of historical scholarship of the last century: Garton Ash places so much

emphasis on " Smith" 's choice because his decision to become an informer

quite possibly had critical and debilitating consequences in the lives of

those he informed on and ( in the aggregate) in propping up the East German

system as a whole.
<ICE-USA:W1A-007#62:1> The lives of common people do matter, and by approaching them through

an " agency within limits" paradigm, twentieth-century historians have

allowed us to see why this is so.</p> </I>
