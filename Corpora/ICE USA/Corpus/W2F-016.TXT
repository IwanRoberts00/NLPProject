<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#3:1> Most people play solitaire with cards.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#4:1> For others, it 's not just a game - - it 's a state of mind. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#5:1> It is my twenty-first birthday.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#6:1> It 's also a Friday night.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#7:1> I can do whatever the hell I want.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#8:1> Everything except paint.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#9:1> Is there such a thing as artist 's block?
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#10:1> Writers get blocked, and they're artists, sort of.
<I 'reUSA:W2F-016#11:1> Or is there some other reason the paper stays blank, all the brushes

in their holders, tubes of paint unopened?
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#12:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#13:1> I have my back turned to my work table as I deal cards onto the

floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#14:1> I made that table myself, particle board on cinder blocks, and it 's

just the right height for me to sit at and paint.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#15:1> It 's even and solid and square.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#16:1> I spent a long time moving the cinder blocks under the wood to

balance it and compensate for the warping of the floorboards. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#17:1> It 's the right height to sit at and play solitaire, too, but even

though it 's empty, I am playing on the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#18:1> I feel too guilty for not painting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#19:1> The emptiness of the table would accuse me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#20:1> I feel hungry.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#21:1> As I finish the game that I'm losing, I promise myself that 'ms soon

as I win once, I'll eat.
<ICE-USA: 'll-016#22:1> I deal myself another game.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#23:1> Looks bad.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#24:1> No aces in sight and I can only do one move at first, put the seven

of clubs on the eight of diamonds.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#25:1> I start to flip my way through the deck. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#26:1> I am a master of solitaire.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#27:1> It is a constant in my life.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#28:1> I use it to dull my mind when I'm upset, to while away the tim 'mwhen

I can't sleep, to smooth the flow of my subconscious when I'm frustrated with

working o 'ma painting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#29:1> I also use it to bribe myself - - I promise myself an uninterrupted

round as soon as I finish a painting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#30:1> Or after I call my mother.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#31:1> Or I use it to delay the inevitable, as I am doing now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#32:1> As soon as I win, I will look up from the worn cards, survey my

shelves, try to find something edible. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#33:1> The games are also keeping me from panicking over the naked

sheets of thick paper, thirsty to soak up water and color.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#34:1> I haven't set brush to paper in two weeks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#35:1> The last thing I painted that I was really happy with was about three

weeks ago.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#36:1> It was a crow sitting on a streetlight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#37:1> I was pleased with the way I managed to catch the highlights of his

feathers, with that kind of dusty shine crows have.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#38:1> And his one yellow eye, his head cocked.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#39:1> Last week I turned that painting to face the wall, because it had

begun to seem like he was staring at me accusingly. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#40:1> I'm worried that my brain will d 'm up with my paint, if it hasn't

already.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#41:1> It 's also been two weeks since I've been to the groce 'vestore.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#42:1> The last two nights I have ordered out - - pizza last night, Chinese

before that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#43:1> I went to the liquor store today, though.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#44:1> On my way home from work I stopped and bought a bottle of scotch with

the last of my petty cash to celebrate today.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#45:1> Tony at the liquor store knows me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#46:1> I've been buying stuff 'veere since I was seventeen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#47:1> Two aces show up in a row: hearts and spades.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#48:1> Hearts in spades.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#49:1> I should have spades and spades of hearts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#50:1> I don't want to think about that now. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#51:1> The year I moved out I was seventeen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#52:1> My parents split up when I was fourteen, and the day the divorce

papers were signed I resolved to get out as soon as I could.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#53:1> It was the usual arrangement: I lived with my mom, spent weekends

once in a while at my dad 's place.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#54:1> Nobody asked me who I'd rather live 'dth. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#55:1> They're OK, my parent 're - they didn't beat me or anything.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#56:1> My dad even came to see the student art show my sophomore year.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#57:1> It 's just that the divorce was very messy and anyone could see that

they had more important things to deal with than me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#58:1> I checked out my options. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#59:1> I was working one night a week stocking at a local comic book

store, and they needed part-time work at the main warehouse.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#60:1> So I worked there after school most of my junior year.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#61:1> They hired me full-time as soon as I got out for summer, and I never

went back to school.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#62:1> After a month I was making twice minimum wage, taking orders over the

phone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#63:1> I rented an apartment on the south side of City Park, a small place,

just to get out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#64:1> After my first six-month lease was up, I found this place.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#65:1> It 's much better than the last one, on the north side, closer to

work, with lots of windows.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#66:1> I could say to my friends that I had light to work with now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#67:1> I told my mom I was barely making the rent payments, and with the two

hundred dollars she gave me I bought a brown-and-red Ford Fiesta. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#68:1> The first time I made love with Jason was in the back of that

car.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#69:1> But I'm not thinking about t 'mt now, as I lay the four and the five

and the six of hearts on top of the pile.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#70:1> I sold it for parts three months ago and bought a Chevy Citation with

an oil leak.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#71:1> I repaired the leak myself with duct tape.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#72:1> Besides, it wasn't making love.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#73:1> It couldn't have been. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#74:1> The sun is setting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#75:1> I can tell because the light is getting red.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#76:1> I can't see the sun when it sets - - the buildings of downtown Denver

are in the way - - but I don't mind.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#77:1> Afternoon light is best to paint by, and the afternoons will be

longer soon, when daylight savings time starts. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#78:1> My dad 's place, where I used to spend weekends, had great light.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#79:1> It 's in the mountains, and it 's very quiet and all that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#80:1> I used to wish that they would let me live with him instead of my

mom, but there would have been no way for me to get to school.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#81:1> So I had to spend weeks at my mom 's place, with her and Dave.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#82:1> Dave always tried to be nice to me, but his idea of being nice was

offering me a beer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#83:1> I hate beer, and they drink too much.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#84:1> Besides, I didn't care if he was nice to me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#85:1> I just wanted him to leave me alone, so I could play solitaire and

think about what I would paint the next weekend at my dad 's.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#86:1> I had a deck of cards with cats on the backs that I used until I lost

the jack of diamonds.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#87:1> These days, cards take a couple of months to wear out between my

fingers, but I keep a spare deck around just in case. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#88:1> When I started drinking, I drank vodka, just like every high

school student.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#89:1> It 's cheap.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#90:1> But the first time I went into Tony 's liquor store, I knew if I tried

to buy vodka, especially dressed the way I usually was, in jeans and tennis

shoes, he'd kno 'dI was underage.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#91:1> So I put on a pair of costume glasses and styled my hair in a French

twist.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#92:1> My hair was long then. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#93:1> After Jason left for college I cut my hair.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#94:1> I read somewhere that a lot of women cut their hair after ending

relationships, but I didn't end it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#95:1> He did.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#96:1> I cropped it short, not more than an inch long.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#97:1> I did it myself, standing in front of the bathroom mirror.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#98:1> I did a pretty good job of it, too, and I've gott 'vebetter, since I

have to trim it every month or so. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#99:1> I wore heels to the liquor store, and a skirt and blouse.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#100:1> I asked the man, who turned out to be Tony, for his recommendations

on what wine to drink with grilled fish and rice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#101:1> He asked me what kind of fish, and I said halibut because I knew it

was a fancy type of fish.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#102:1> He recommended a French dry white wine from Meursault-Blagny,

whatever that means.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#103:1> I only remember it because I saved the bottle.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#104:1> I put flowers in it once in a while.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#105:1> I thanked him, and bought it, and he didn't card me, so the fifteen

dollars I spent on the wine was worth it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#106:1> The next time I went into the store, I wore a short skirt and a

blouse with three buttons open and bought some Grand Marnier.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#107:1> After that I knew I was safe.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#108:1> He 's never carded me, even when I've bou 've vodka. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#109:1> When the jack and queen of spades show up in the right order, I

know I've won 'vee game.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#110:1> But I play to the end as I always do, and then slide the cards

together into a pile.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#111:1> I've pla 've so much solitaire, it 's become another art to me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#112:1> I know a lot of different games, from clock solitaire to forty

thieves, which is a two-deck version, to portable solitaire that you can play

in one hand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#113:1> The person who taught me portable solitaire said it was great for

airplanes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#114:1> I've ne 've been on an airplane. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#115:1> I still have staples left.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#116:1> Rice, flour, spices, that kind of thing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#117:1> Some cans of tomato paste.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#118:1> I put a pan of water on to boil and measure out rice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#119:1> I don't sit down to play again because I know that if I do I will

let the water boil down to nothing rather than interrupt my game.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#120:1> I glance at my painting corner as I salt the water. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#121:1> I really should paint something, but I've be 'vetelling myself

that for days.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#122:1> My half-finished efforts, except for one, are stacked behind the

table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#123:1> I hate most of them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#124:1> I tried painting my hand holding a deck of cards, I tried painting a

group of people playing poker, and finally I just tried to paint a big king

of spades.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#125:1> When I noticed that it had Jason 's nose, I tore it up.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#126:1> I wander into my bedroom and throw a couple of dirty shirts into the

clothes basket.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#127:1> I'm nor 'mlly very neat, it 's only during this dry spell - - that 's

what I' 'llcall it, it has a nice ring - - that I'v 'vehrown my dirty clothes

into the corner instead of in the basket. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#128:1> When I was finally ready to show Jason my place, my apartment

that was a studio even though it wasn't a studio apartment, I thought maybe I

should throw some things on the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#129:1> It 's usually very clean, and I didn't want him to think I had

cleaned up for him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#130:1> We made love - - no, we had sex on my bed, which is really a

mattress on the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#131:1> He didn't stay the night, because his mother didn't know where he

was. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#132:1> He was eight months younger than me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#133:1> I had forgotten that people my age still lived with their parents,

still listened to their mothers, still called if they were going to be out

late.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#134:1> So he left me with kisses, saying he wished he could stay.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#135:1> At three in the morning I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep,

because I could smell him in the sheets.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#136:1> It bothered me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#137:1> I felt fiercely territorial about my place.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#138:1> So I got up and took a long shower and changed the sheets on the

bed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#139:1> I put the dirty ones in a pillowcase to separate them from the other

untainted laundry.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#140:1> Then I felt better, and I went back to sleep.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#141:1> The water is boiling, and I dump in the rice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#142:1> I make a deal with myself that I can play solitaire, but I will

interrupt my game to get the rice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#143:1> In payment for this, I am allowed to cheat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#144:1> I have devised several ways of doing this.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#145:1> There are rules even for cheating.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#146:1> Sometimes I give myself permission to go through the deck more than

the specified number of times.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#147:1> Sometimes I can switch the positions of certain cards.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#148:1> Sometimes I let one card be wild.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#149:1> Tonight I play that black can go on black and red can go on red, but

only if they 're opposite suits. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#150:1> Jason had this deck of cards that he had drilled a hole through.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#151:1> That was the first thing that I noticed when I met him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#152:1> He had a job at the same warehouse I did, but in a different

department.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#153:1> It was my second summer there, and his first.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#154:1> He was going to work full time for a year, to earn money before he

went to college. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-016#155:1> I came down to the break room for a Coke and he was playing

solitaire on the lunch table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#156:1> I noticed that he didn't play very well, and that there was a hole

in every single card.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#157:1> The holes weren't in the middle - - they were a little off center,

toward the top left corner.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#158:1> We were the only two people in the room.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#159:1> I knew better than to suggest moves to him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#160:1> I also knew that everyone probably asked him about the holes in his

cards, so I didn't.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#161:1> I just sat down across from him and drank my Coke.
<ICE-USA:W2F-016#162:1> </I>
