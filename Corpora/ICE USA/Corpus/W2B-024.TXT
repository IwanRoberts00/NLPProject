<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#1:1> If fibers were indeed a structural component of the wing, then

they, rather than the ambiguous impressions of the wing membrane, may be the

best indicator of a pterosaur wing 's shape.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#2:1> And according to the fibers, pterosaurs had narrow, birdlike wings

that attached at the hip or the mid- thigh.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#3:1> Rayner, whose specialty is animal aerodynamics, says the fibers would

have given the wings so much stiffness that a pterosaur wouldn't have needed

to keep its wings taut with its feet, as a bat does.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#4:1> Instead the fibers would have acted more like a bird 's stiff feather

shafts, which, when the bird brings its wing down, transfer the lift

generated by the wing to the rest of the body.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#5:1> The shape of pterosaur wings must have affected not only how they

flew but also how they moved on the ground.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#6:1> Birds, with their wings free of their hind legs, can walk easily.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#7:1> But bats have to deal with two problems: their wings connect their

arms to their legs, and their legs are designed to swing out to the side.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#8:1> In flight this keeps the wing membrane tight, but on the ground it

makes a bat 's legs too loose to support the weight of its body.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#9:1> As a result, bats crawl on all fours, with their long arms and

flexible legs splayed out to the sides.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#10:1> Just as pterosaurs' wings were designed for birdlike flight,

Padian maintains, their legs were designed for bipedal, birdlike walking.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#11:1> He points out that the head of their femur was oriented to swing the

leg forward and backward, not side to side, and their ankle bones had fused

into a hinge that couldn't bend out in a sprawl.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#12:1> Far from crawling on all fours, he says, pterosaurs walked on two

legs as comfortably as a dinosaur or a bird--which, Padian argues, shouldn't

be surprising.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#13:1> " They really are coming from fairly similar ancestral stocks," he

says, " and so a lot of what they do is going to be predisposed to be

similar.a
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#14:1> Pterosaurs with wings folded up on either side also leave their hands

relatively free for handling food or climbing trees.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#15:1> But the traditional batlike stance still charms many

paleontologists.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#16:1> " I find myself with the fuddy-duddies dotted around the world," says

David Unwin of the University of Bristol.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#17:1> " In our humble opinion, the legs sort of stick out sideways and the

animals tend to sprawl somewhat on the ground and walk around in a

quadrupedal fashion.a
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#18:1> Unwin, along with Wellnhofer, has argued that the hips of pterosaurs

had sockets unsuited for walking on two legs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#19:1> If a pterosaur tried to walk upright, they maintain, the pelvis

wouldn't bear directly down on the femur and the femur heads would tend to

pop out of their sockets.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#20:1> " I think you can get pterosaur hind limbs into a bipedal position in

the same way I can do a split," says Unwin.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#21:1> " It hurts, but I may be able to do it with a bit of training.a </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#22:1> Padian counters that what might seem unlikely judging from only

one part of a skeleton becomes possible when you add supporting cartilage and

muscle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#23:1> " What pterosaurs can't do," Padian adds, " is jerk the hind limb out

to the side in exactly the way a bat does it.a </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#24:1> Recently, Christopher Bennett of the University of Kansas gave

some of Padian 's ideas a new twist.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#25:1> By tilting the hip 60 degrees from the horizontal, he found that a

protruding part of the socket 's rim was positioned so that it could bear down

on a femur head.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#26:1> A pterosaur with such a hip wouldn't be hunched over like a bird; it

would be upright, something between a gorilla and a human.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#27:1> Instead of walking on its toes, it would roll back on its heels and

keep its feet flat on the ground.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#28:1> Pterosaurs standing as tall as 20 feet might have strolled along the

banks of lagoons with a humanlike gait.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#29:1> ONCE YOU KNOW how an extinct animal moved--whether it crawled or

ran, flapped its wings or only glided--you can get an idea of how it fit into

the ecological web of its time.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#30:1> If, as Padian argues, pterosaurs flew more like birds than bats, then

one would expect them to play birdlike roles in their ecology as well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#31:1> Rayner and graduate student Grant Hazelhurst have found evidence

for this idea in the geometry of pterosaur bodies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#32:1> Previous research has shown that the ratios determined by a flying

animal 's mass, wingspan, and wing surface area predict what kind of flight

style it will have.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#33:1> Forest birds share similar ratios, while soarers have their own set,

as do the insect eaters, divers, and so on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#34:1> Rayner and Hazelhurst found that the combination of long, thin wings

and slender, lightweight bodies made large pterosaurs very aerodynamically

efficient, able to soar on the weakest of rising air currents.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#35:1> Many of the largest pterosaurs may have been like today 's frigate

bird: perhaps they soared hundreds of miles over the ocean, grabbing fish or

harassing other pterosaurs to surrender their catches.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#36:1> Perhaps, also like the frigate bird, they were helpless if they

accidentally landed on water.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#37:1> Smaller pterosaurs probably flew like sea gulls and petrels, needing

to flap more often to keep themselves aloft.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#38:1> Other pterosaurs were aerial hunters like falcons.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#39:1> And the smallest ones were the swallows of their day, chasing insects

and maneuvering to match their prey 's unpredictable flight.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#40:1> Rayner and Hazelhurst 's work is just as interesting for what it

says pterosaurs didn't do as for what it says they did.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#41:1> Their long wings disqualified them from diving for fish like a duck

or loon because they would have caused too much drag in the water.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#42:1> The researchers also say those long wings would have been unwieldy in

forests.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#43:1> " If you've got a 'ved living in trees or nesting in twigs, it has a

real problem if it 's got very long wings because they can knock against the

environment," Rayner explains.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#44:1> Rayner is the first to point out that the fossils may be skewing

his view.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#45:1> The fossils of small land animals are most often preserved in watery

environments, such as oceans or lagoons, so creatures that kept to forests,

deserts, or plains left behind much sketchier traces.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#46:1> Rayner didn't consider many pterosaurs that have left only

fragmentary remains.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#47:1> For example, paleontologists know the giant Quetzalcoatlus only from

the arm bones of a single animal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#48:1> As a result, it 's still not clear exactly what its physical

proportions were, and paleontologists suspect that its wings may actually

have been small for its body.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#49:1> Quetzalcoatlus is also unusual because it wasn't found by an ocean

but instead in what were once seasonal wetlands far inland in Texas.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#50:1> The biggest birds that live in these kinds of habitats today are

egrets and herons, which ( possibly like Quetzalcoatlus) have relatively

small, squarish wings that let them keep clear of the trees and other plants

around them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#51:1> Imagine Quetzalcoatlus as a spectacularly oversize egret, wading

silently and delicately through the marsh, its long neck pulled back, and

then suddenly plunging its head into the water to snatch fish with its

chopsticks-style jaws.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#52:1> Other pterosaurs apparently foreshadowed birds' feeding habits in

surprising ways.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#53:1> One, named Pterodaustro, had hundreds of long bristlelike teeth in

its lower jaw.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#54:1> Flamingos have similar ridges in their bill that they use to filter

out algae and insects from water.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#55:1> Pterodaustro was exactly suited for that kind of feeding and

supremely unqualified for anything else.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#56:1> In London, Stafford Howse has been studying the jaw of a pterosaur he

refers to as the Purbeck spoonbill, after the geologic formation in England

where it was found; like the living spoonbills of Africa and Asia, it had a

long, narrow beak ending in two horizontal disks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#57:1> Spoonbills today move their beak through mud at the bottom of streams

and lakes to stir up the animals they feed on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#58:1> The Purbeck spoonbill seems to have been even better adapted to this

kind of feeding because it had several dozen sturdy curved teeth on both

jaws.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#59:1> Although useless for chewing, since they jutted away from the mouth,

they would have been perfect as a mud rake.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#60:1> More over, part of the roof of the Purbeck spoonbill 's mouth was

lined with horn; when it dug up snails and other shelled animals, it could

have broken them open like a nutcracker.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#61:1> In 1991 it occurred to University of Miami ecologist Thomas

Fleming that some pterosaurs ought to have eaten fruit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#62:1> Fruit-bearing plants now depend on bats, birds, and primates to eat

their fruit and spread the seeds in their droppings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#63:1> Yet paleobotanists believe that for 40 million years after

fruit-bearing plants first appeared, these dispersers either hadn't yet

evolved or were rare.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#64:1> There were plant-eating dinosaurs, of course, but they probably

destroyed the seeds in their enormous, slow-moving digestive systems.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#65:1> However, Fleming hypothesized, the seeds would probably have survived

a passage through a pterosaur 's small gut.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#66:1> Furthermore, it made sense that pterosaurs would have taken advantage

of a food that could provide them with the energy they needed for flying.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#67:1> The only problem with Fleming 's idea was that at the time there

weren't any pterosaurs known that might have been fruit eaters.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#68:1> Fleming decided to publish his suggestion anyway, and only after

his paper had been typeset did Wellnhofer tell him about a pterosaur from

Araripe that he and Kellner were beginning to describe; they had named it

Tapejara ( meaning " the old being" in the language of the Tupi Indians).
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#69:1> This pterosaur had an eight-inch-long head dominated by a high, thin

prow in front of its nose that tapered back to a narrow prong above the eye.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#70:1> Its toothless jaws were like a precise pair of tweezers, sharp and

slightly bowed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#71:1> The combination of crest and beak rules out many of the usual

pterosaur feeding techniques.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#72:1> The fish eaters had either gripping teeth or long jaws like a

pelican 's.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#73:1> Tapejara 's beak might have been good for picking at carrion, but its

crest would have gotten in the way when it tried to poke into a carcass.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#74:1> Yet both its crest and its beak made Tapejara well suited for picking

fruit.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#75:1> It could have used the crest to push aside thick foliage and could

then have plucked fruit from the stem with its beak, which is precisely what

hornbills and toucans do today.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#76:1> If so, then perhaps pterosaurs like Tapejara were crucial to the

evolution of fruits like avocados and mangoes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#77:1> FLYING AND EATING undoubtedly took up a healthy part of a

pterosaur 's day but not all of it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#78:1> What did pterosaurs do the rest of the time?
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#79:1> What was their social life like?
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#80:1> Christopher Bennett has recently shed some light on the question for

a pterosaur known as Pteranodon, which lived from 115 million to 70 million

years ago along the coast of a sea that ran down the middle of North America.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#81:1> It was among the best of the soaring pterosaurs, with a wingspan

ranging from 10 to 25 feet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#82:1> Pteranodon fossils have been found at sites that were 100 miles or

more from the coastline of the ancient sea, which suggests that these

pterosaurs regularly flew great distances in search of food.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#83:1> Bennett compared some 1,100 Pteranodon fossils, plotting on a

graph the length of their individual leg bones, finger bones, and so on.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#84:1> In each case the measurements bunched into two distinct groups.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#85:1> The average individual in the small group, he calculated, had a

wingspan of 12.5 feet, while the larger ones averaged 19 feet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#86:1> The smaller pteranodons seemed to be more common, outnumbering the

larger creatures two to one.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#87:1> Beyond their size--and presumably their weight--there were only

two other differences Bennett could find between the groups: the pelvises of

the large animals were proportionately narrow, while those belonging to the

smaller ones were wide; the smaller animals also had small crests, while the

large pteranodons had extravagant ones.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#88:1> Paleontologists have long speculated on the purpose of pterosaur

crests.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#89:1> Did they improve the aerodynamics of the body?
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#90:1> Did they act as a rudder?
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#91:1> Kellner points out that Tupuxuara 's fossilized crest was covered with

the impressions of blood vessels.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#92:1> A dense mesh of capillaries on the crest, he proposes, might have

acted like an air conditioner during flight, bringing hot blood close to the

skin.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#93:1> Bennett doesn't think either aerodynamics or cooling makes sense.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#94:1> If a small crest is sufficient to do the job, then why do a third of

the pteranodons have much bigger ones?
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#95:1> The only explanation that made sense to him was that he was looking

at male and female pteranodons.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#96:1> The crests were primarily male mating displays, like antlers on an

elk or a long tail on a bird, and the wide hips of the smaller, female

pteranodons were designed to pass eggs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-024#97:1> To understand this combination of sexual differences in size,

displays, and population ratios, Bennett turned to living animals as

analogues.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#98:1> He found several creatures with these traits, ranging from elephant

seals to boat-tailed grackles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#99:1> And, he learned, they all court, mate, and raise their young in a

similar fashion.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#100:1> Bennett thinks Pteranodon probably did the same.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#101:1> He envisions male pteranodons on crowded rookeries lining the ocean,

competing for the attention of females.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#102:1> Usually crest and body-size display would be enough for males to

ward off challengers, but occasionally they might have to fight.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#103:1> The winners would maintain big harems of the smaller females, but

they 'd offer no help in raising their young.
<ICE-USA:W2B-024#104:1> The unlucky males could only look on enviously.</p></I>пя
