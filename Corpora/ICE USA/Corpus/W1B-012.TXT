<ICE-USA:W1B-012#1:1> <h> 2 September 1991</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#2:1> <h> Dear Clare,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#3:1> I started a letter to you eight days ago, and another four days

ago, but kept not being able to finish them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#4:1> As you know I have such a hectic schedule here in Deerfield.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#5:1> But I've promised myself I' 'veoing to finish this o 'm.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#6:1> Thanks for the postcard from North Dakota!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#7:1> How did the interview go?
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#8:1> You must have been really tired from traveling, but I'm sure they were

impr 'msed with you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#9:1> By now you must be heading for Boston to get your stick-shift car.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#10:1> I hope you made it home without incident.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#11:1> My interview at DePaul did not go all that well.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#12:1> I was nervous; I thought I had prepared every question anyone could

think of but there were some I wasn't prepared for.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#13:1> And I really didn't anticipate how mentally stressful it would be to

be talking to people for six hours.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#14:1> Even in the bathroom!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#15:1> At one point there was a break between sessions and the head of

reference was explaining to me where the nearest restroom was, then she

decided she had to go too and would just come along.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#16:1> And she talked all the time!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#17:1> I just sat on the john for a minute with my head in my hands thinking

" Can't I just have a MOMENT of privacy here?!"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#18:1> Anyway... I went home that night full of self-recrimination,

fanning the flames of my sense of personal inadequacy.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#19:1> I had three strong gin-and-tonics with dinner and afterwards made my

dad take me to the library so I could get some to read myself to sleep with.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#20:1> ( I was afraid to drive!)
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#21:1> The next morning I gave myself a firm talking-to about learning from

this experience...
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#22:1> Then I got a huge surprise.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#23:1> Michigan State called to ask me to come for an interview! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#24:1> This was Friday afternoon and they wanted me to come Tuesday and

Wednesday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#25:1> So I spent the next three days in total anxiety, threw out all my

notes on answers to interview questions and started over.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#26:1> It went MUCH better even though it was twice as long.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#27:1> The worst session was on Wednesday, a panel of six people in a

boardroom with me at the head of the table.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#28:1> Analogies to the Spanish Inquisition kept floating into my head and

having to be suppressed.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#29:1> Then an hour with the director of the library...
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#30:1> As you can imagine I felt like a wrung-out dishrag after all this was

over!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#31:1> But I think I have a much better chance at this job than Depaul and

frankly, I WANT it a lot more - - now that there 's a alternative to DePaul

it 's a lot less attractive.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#32:1> I would be much more at home in East Lansing than in the western

suburbs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#33:1> I won't know about either job for about 3 weeks so I'm trying to

keep my 'mind off it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#34:1> I have a pile of books to read and I'm working out how I wa 'm to

repaint some of my furniture.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#35:1> I really like the chairs and tables painted by artists that I've seen

at vario 'vegalleries ( and I always think " I could do that!")
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#36:1> I have in mind painting the little bookshelf midnight blue, with

stars and comets on the sides; and the dresser from my bedroom white with big

black or brown spots like a cow 's.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#37:1> My mainstream parents think it is the strangest thing they've ever

heard o 'vebut " It 's your furniture!"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#38:1> The latest Twilight Zone interaction with my parents involves

mangoes.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#39:1> A humble fruit from the South Seas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#40:1> About two weeks ago when I did the grocery shopping I got a mango,

just to see what it was like.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#41:1> On Monday that week my mom was visiting my grandmother in the nursing

home.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#42:1> I fixed dinner for Dad and sliced up the mango for dessert.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#43:1> He really liked it so last week I got another.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#44:1> Before I left on Tuesday I noticed it was getting soft and mentioned

to my mom that they ought to eat it soon because it would spoil.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#45:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#46:1> When I got home on Thursday night there was this rotton mango in

the fruit bowl.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#47:1> My parents, college graduates both, told me they couldn't eat it

because neither one knew how to slice it!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#48:1> Needless to say I was absolutely speechless at this revelation!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#49:1> Maybe if I stay here long enough I can write a book about it...
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#50:1> Got to go.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#51:1> Let me know as soon as you hear anything from North Dakota!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#52:1> If you go back to Olean, let me know your address.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#53:1> You may need some contact with sanity too!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#54:1> I'm listening to Bru 'm Springsteen now to try to inject some

energy into this lifeless atmosphere.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#55:1> Don't you think I was Born to Run?</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#56:1> <h> Love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#57:1> <h> Rachel</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#58:1> <h> 6 November 1991</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#59:1> <h> Dear Clare,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#60:1> Hi!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#61:1> At the rate I'm going at work yo 'mll probab 'llget this letter before

I have a chance to send you an e-mail message.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#62:1> All of a sudden I'm really busy-- b 'm that 's much better than being

bored-- and everytime I try to check my email either someone is on the

computer or I can't sign on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#63:1> The communications software we use seems to have a lot of bugs-- its

annoying.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#64:1> What I'm working on rig 'm now is the first of several handouts to

add to our arsenal during the winter and spring term of papers for " ATL"--

American Thought and Language, a required course that all freshmen have to

take.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#65:1> About 9000 kids!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#66:1> The one I'm working on now 'ms on current newspaper sources, then I'm

going to do 'mne on how to find primary sources.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#67:1> We have a really big microforms collection so that one will be fun.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#68:1> One thing I found while I was poking around in the micro library was

a set of American women 's diaries from the 18th and 19th century, about 75 or

100 in the set.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#69:1> How fascinating!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#70:1> Maybe I'll come 'll one Sunday afternoon to read them.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#71:1> Its rather cold here but nothing like what you're getting 're the

Great Plains!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#72:1> I thought of you and the errant car heater when that snowstorm hit.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#73:1> Did you get your car fixed?
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#74:1> Do you have a block heater now like all the other Minnesotans?
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#75:1> The cold snap here made me realize that I really need a winter coat -

- a raincoat with a heavy liner just isn't going to cut it-- so I've been

s 'veping the last few nights on my way home and I finally found one I liked -

- a long, black one with kind of a dark multicolored trim.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#76:1> Anyway, its long, its warm, and I have black winter boots to go with

it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#77:1> On Sunday night I was coming home from a movie and it was really cold

and windy, and I suddenly realized how miserable it would be if I got

stranded or stuck in the snow on a cold night.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#78:1> So now I have a grocery bag in the trunk stuffed with an old

sweatshirt, wool socks, extra gloves, and a bag of kitty litter for traction.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#79:1> I'm ready!
<I 'm-USA:W1B-012#80:1> I just hope I don't have to put all this to use.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#81:1> When I think of all these preparations and precautions I just shake

my head in amazement.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#82:1> My entire adult life all I ever had to do for transportation was make

sure I had my bus pass in my wallet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#83:1> I'm really fee 'mng much better this week than I had been all the

month of October.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#84:1> I got my first paycheck - - paid my bills and sent a big chunk of

money to the Visa people-- and I have enough mental energy when I come home

to cook something nicer for dinner than Chinese noodles - - you know those

packets of noodles that you boil for 3 minutes and add a packet of 'seasoning'

( ie salt and brown food coloring).
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#85:1> That 's what I ate practically every night the 1st four weeks I was

here!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#86:1> I had sort of an odd insight into anxiety and stress today - -

specifically how I deal with them-- when I'm really a 'mious about something (

a common occurrence lately) it doesn't help a bit to try to convince myself

that it 's a temporary state, that I'll f 'll better later.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#87:1> In fact I feel worse when people tell me that.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#88:1> Instead its as if I just have to live with it long enough to convince

myself that I could live with the anxiety permanently if I had to, not that I

would be happy but I could survive.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#89:1> Knowing that I can cope with it lets me give it up.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#90:1> Does that make any sense?
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#91:1> I know what you mean, how you're fee 'reg, about being isolated.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#92:1> Its hard trying to find a place for yourself in a situation where

people have been working together for years, and wondering if its really

worth the effort to try.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#93:1> I'm feeli 'm a renewed homesickness for Chicago, even.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#94:1> Perhaps the new reference libn.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#95:1> At UND will be someone amiable and the two of you will be new

together...
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#96:1> I'm glad 'mat you have Janice with you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#97:1> I don't know where I'd b 'dsometimes without Ema to take my mind off

things and make me laugh.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#98:1> I cheered when you mentioned Michigan as a possible place to look

for your next job.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#99:1> That would be fabulous!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#100:1> ( In fact anywhere east of the Mississippi would be good!) When you

are ready to start looking next year ( or whatever) I'll 'llyour inside

source!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#101:1> Take care of yourself.</p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#102:1> <h> Much love,</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#103:1> <h> Rachel</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#104:1> <h> 2/21/92</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#105:1> <h> Hi Clare,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#106:1> I am comfortably ensconsed at a table at the laundromat, with a

print out of your email, my laundry basket, and lunch before me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#107:1> I guess this is life in the 90s - - having lunch out during the

recession means eating at the Haslett Wash + Dry!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#108:1> I'm usi 'm 3 hours of comp time because I have a really busy weekend,

so I worked 8-1, had a lovely quick trip to a used bookstore, and its 2:00

and here I am.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#109:1> I have to go to my art class tomorrow morning, then dress rehearsal

for the Choral Union concert and performance in the evening.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#110:1> And work all day Sunday ( more comp time!)
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#111:1> Next weekend I get both days off.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#112:1> I thought it was about time I wrote you a good long letter!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#113:1> Its hard to at home - Ema is SO PERSISTENT about being ON TOP OF ME

all the time-- If I'm sit 'mng at the kitchen she 's there, usually sitting on

the newspaper, book, tax forms or whatever!
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#114:1> If I'm si 'ming in the easy chair she 's on my lap immediately.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#115:1> In bed she sleeps on my stomach or legs...
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#116:1> It makes me feel guilty because she obviously is lonesome.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#117:1> I wish I could get another cat to keep her company.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#118:1> Oops-- looks like I printed out an old message and deleted the

most recent one...
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#119:1> but as I recall you were feeling frustrated about being on a dull

committee instead of an interesting one, and Randy 's presence is taking some

getting used to.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#120:1> Maybe they are helping Randy more because they don't think he is

quite as capable and competent as you?
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#121:1> You have a great deal more experience than he has, after all - -

about 16 months' head start.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#122:1> I know it can be exasperating to have someone around who 's so

gung-ho when you' 'reexperiencing lack of enthusiasm-- it makes you feel even

more cynical than you already do.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-012#123:1> I don't know if this is good advice, but I have always found

that it gives my spirits a lift to actively work on getting to the next stage

of my life, if the present one is less than ideal, like working on my

bibliography so I 'll have a publication to my credit.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#124:1> On the plus side, you could say that this is very proactive, shows

initiative, etc.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#125:1> On the minus side I think it diverts my attention from making a real

effort to adapt to my situation here, to improve things instead of giving up

and saying, " I don't care because I 'm leaving soon."
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#126:1> After all, there is a risk of failure in committing myself to this

situation, but not in planning for the future.
<ICE-USA:W1B-012#127:1> It hasn't happened yet so its still clean+ fresh ( choice of

adjectives influenced by my surroundings!)</p> </I>
