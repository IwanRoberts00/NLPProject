<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#1:1> Friday evening, the day the Hill-Thomas hearings began, a friend

called and said she wasn't sure why she was so fascinated by the proceedings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#2:1> I said it might be because we almost never see more than a glimpse of

a real black woman on TV talking about anything, let alone the painful

realities of racial-sexual politics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#3:1> Both of us found it compelling, simply to watch Anita Hill-bright,

sincere, black, and female.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#4:1> Here was someone we recognized.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#5:1> Here was someone we believed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#6:1> I can think of no other situation that has commanded the nation 's

undivided attention that so clearly illustrated the inextricable links

between racism and sexism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#7:1> It 's difficult to conceive how the hearings could be understood from

anything other than a black feminist perspective.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#8:1> A perspective that doesn't require shortchanging any aspect of black

women 's reality or assume racial oppression is more important than sexual

oppression or vice versa.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#9:1> But of course this was not the way Anita Hill 's description of

sexual harassment was responded to, which explains in part why this drama

ended as it did.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#10:1> As a black feminist, I've long believed 'vet political analyses

and strategies that take into account how racism, sexism, homophobia, and

class oppression dovetail and interlock, provide the clearest and most

revolutionary agendas for change.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#11:1> Unfortunately, the outcome seemingly illustrates that my perspective

and that of most women of color simply doesn't count, because ultimately it 's

the white male ruling class that gets to define reality and call the

shots.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#12:1> Yes, I was furious at how Anita Hill was treated, but as a black

feminist, a socialist, and a lesbian, I was not particularly surprised.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#13:1> I don't expect justice from the Republicans or the Democrats, whose

duplicity and ineffectualness were revealed in bas-relief during the

hearings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#14:1> I also don't agree with the mainstream women 's movement 's singular

solution to run as many women for office as possible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#15:1> Late twentieth-century U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#16:1> capitalism cannot be fixed by adding new faces to the ruling

class.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#17:1> The worst consequence of the Hill-Thomas hearings for me was in

what they revealed about African Americans' level of consciousness regarding

both sexual and racial politics.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#18:1> It has always taken courage for women of color to speak out about

sexism within our communities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#19:1> In this instance it was done more publicly and dramatically than at

any time in history.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#20:1> For that, Hill was attacked not only by white right-wing misogynists,

but by African Americans who felt that she had stepped out of line by

accusing a black man chosen by white racists for high office.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#21:1> It was demoralizing to see how the confrontation reinforced the

perception that any woman who raises the issue of sexual oppression in the

black community is somehow a traitor to the race, which translates into being

a traitor to black men.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#22:1> It is particularly disheartening knowing that probably a lot of black

people took this stance despite believing Anita Hill.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#23:1> They who decided that standing behind a black man--even one with

utter contempt for the struggles of African Americans--is more important than

supporting a black woman 's right not to be abused.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#24:1> But the attitudes brought to the surface by the Hill- Thomas

confrontation are not unique.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#25:1> As in the heyday of the 1965 Moynihan Report, black women are again

seen as the cause of the myriad problems our people face.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#26:1> Despite the fact that we experience sexual as well as racial and

class oppression, black women are thought to be in a much better position

than endangered black men.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#27:1> Blaming black women instead of capitalism, racism, and those who run

the system is a political dead end.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#28:1> And yet negative views of black women abound.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#29:1> Recent films by black men ridicule us, scapegoat us for all of the

race 's problems, and portray violence against us as perfectly justifiable.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#30:1> Rap music almost always defines black women as shrews, with no value

other than as sexual commodities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#31:1> Black male teenagers in many cities are wearing T-shirts with the

words SHUT UP BITCH written in bold letters.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#32:1> This increasing misogyny and those polls indicating that most

black Americans supported Thomas, tell me how much work black feminists still

have to do.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#33:1> We must alert our communities to issues of sexual violence and get

out the message that respecting black women 's freedom does not subtract from

the freedom of black men.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#34:1> Yes, the Hill-Thomas confrontation was incredibly depressing, but

it was also politically catalytic.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#35:1> It illustrated why the work of activist feminists of color is so

crucial, why we must continue to build a movement whose politics have the

revolutionary potential to free us all.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#36:1> It also helped to radicalize more women.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#37:1> ( One of them, I hope, is Anita Hill.)
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#38:1> I see numerous signs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#39:1> African American Women in Defense of Ourselves is a grassroots

network that sprang up within days of the hearings and placed ads in the New

York <it> Times </it> ( November 17, 1991) and in African American newspapers

all over the country.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#40:1> Their clear analysis of the hearings, signed by 1,603 black women,

marks a watershed in black feminist organizing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#41:1> Never have so many black women publicly stated their refusal to pit

racial oppression against sexual oppression.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#42:1> The ad has elicited an outpouring of support, and the enthusiastic

signers intend to create an ongoing mechanism for organizing and speaking

out.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#43:1> Revolutionary Sisters of Color is a socialist-feminist

organization that is building a political base both nationally and

internationally.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#44:1> Founded in 1990, this is the first autonomous group embracing all

women of color in this country and abroad committed to an explicitly

socialist and feminist agenda that confronts the capitalist basis for racial,

sexual, and homophobic oppression.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#45:1> I find it encouraging that some black men were furious about what

happened to Anita Hill and had the integrity to speak out.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#46:1> Many more need to do so.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#47:1> That too is part of our struggle.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#48:1> I hope that white feminists have a better sense of the challenges

women of color face when we make the commitment to confront sexual

oppression.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#49:1> Those who really want to support our struggle can best do so by

cleaning the racism out of their own houses.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#50:1> This can only be accomplished by participating in political

organizing that directly challenges the multiple oppressions women of color

face, oppressions that undermine <it> their </it> lives as well.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#51:1> Not only would we then have more trustworthy allies, but it would

also be that much harder to accuse us of being the dupes of unprincipled

white women.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#52:1> Although Thomas' confirmation seemingly demonstrated the

overarching power of the white male ruling class, I got a different message.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#53:1> The powers that be are in serious trouble.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#54:1> This was only the latest example of their efforts to maintain their

hold upon the failing capitalist economy and upon an image of power by using

desperate means, by resorting to ever more outrageous lies and deceptions

just to stay in place.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#55:1> Yes, it 's going to be a long struggle.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#56:1> But in the after-math of the Hill-Thomas episode, my new T-shirt will

display the words of the old freedom song, AIN'T GONNA LET NOBODY TURN ME

AROUND!</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2B-013#57:2> <h> Becoming the Third Wave by Rebecca Walker </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#58:2> I am not one of the people who sat transfixed before the

television, watching the Senate hearings.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#59:2> I had classes to go to, papers to write, and frankly, the whole thing

was too painful.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#60:2> A black man grilled by a panel of white men about his sexual

deviance.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#61:2> A black woman claiming harassment and being discredited by other

women....
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#62:2> I could not bring myself to watch that sensationalized assault of the

human spirit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#63:2> To me, the hearings were not about determining whether or not

Clarence Thomas did in fact harass Anita Hill.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#64:2> They were about checking and redefining the extent of women 's

credibility and power.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#65:2> Can a woman 's experience undermine a man 's career?
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#66:2> Can a woman 's voice, a woman 's sense of self-worth and injustice,

challenge a structure predicated upon the subjugation of our gender?
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#67:2> Anita Hill 's testimony threatened to do that and more.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#68:2> If Thomas had not been confirmed, every man in the United States

would be at risk.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#69:2> For how many senators never told a sexist joke?
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#70:2> How many men have not used their protected male privilege to thwart

in some way the influence or ideas of a woman colleague, friend, or

relative?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#71:2> For those whose sense of power is so obviously connected to the

health and vigor of the penis, it would have been a metaphoric castration.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#72:2> Of course this is too great a threat.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#73:2> While some may laud the whole spectacle for the consciousness it

raised around sexual harassment, its very real outcome is more informative.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#74:2> He was promoted.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#75:2> She was repudiated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#76:2> Men were assured of the inviolability of their penis/power.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#77:2> Women were admonished to keep their experiences to themselves.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#78:2> The backlash against U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#79:2> women is real.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#80:2> As the misconception of equality between the sexes becomes more

ubiquitous, so does the attempt to restrict the boundaries of women 's

personal and political power.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#81:2> Thomas' confirmation, the ultimate rally of support for the male

paradigm of harassment, sends a clear message to women: " Shut up!
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#82:2> Even if you speak, we will not listen."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#83:2> I will not be silenced.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#84:2> I acknowledge the fact that we live under siege.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#85:2> I in- tend to fight back.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#86:2> I have uncovered and unleashed more repressed anger than I thought

possible.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#87:2> For the umpteenth time in my 22 years, I have been radicalized,

politicized, shaken awake.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#88:2> I have come to voice again, and this time my voice is not

conciliatory.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#89:2> The night after Thomas' confirmation I ask the man I am intimate

with what he thinks of the whole mess.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#90:2> His concern is primarily with Thomas' propensity to demolish civil

rights and opportunities for people of color.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#91:2> I launch into a tirade.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#92:2> " When will progressive black men prioritize my rights and

well-being?
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#93:2> When will they stop talking so damn much about 'the race' as if it

revolved exclusively around them?"
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#94:2> He tells me I wear my emotions on my sleeve.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#95:2> I scream " I need to know, are you with me or are you going to help

them try to destroy me?"</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#96:2> A week later I am on a train to New York.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#97:2> A beautiful mother and daughter, both wearing green outfits, sit

across the aisle from me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#98:2> The little girl has tightly plaited braids.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#99:2> Her brown skin is glowing and smooth, her eyes bright as she chatters

happily while looking out the window.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#100:2> Two men get on the train and sit directly behind me, shaking my seat

as they thud into place.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#101:2> I bury myself in <it> The Sound and the Fury </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#102:2> Loudly they begin to talk about women.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#103:2> " Man, I fucked that bitch all night and then I never called her

again." " Man, there 's lots of girlies over there, you know that ho, live

over there by Tyrone?
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#104:2> Well, I snatched that shit up."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#105:2> The mother moves closer to her now quiet daughter.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#106:2> Looking at her small back I can see that she is listening to the

men.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#107:2> I am thinking of how I can transform the situation, of all the

people in the car whose silence makes us complicit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#108:2> Another large man gets on the train.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#109:2> After exchanging loud greetings with the two men, he sits next to

me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#110:2> He tells them he is going to Philadelphia to visit his wife and

child.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#111:2> I am suckered into thinking that he is different.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#112:2> Then, " Man, there 's a ton of females in Philly, just waitin' for

you to give 'em some."<ICE-USA:W2B-013#> I turn my head and allow the fire in my eyes to

burn into him.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#113:2> He takes up two seats and has hands with huge swollen knuckles.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#114:2> I imagine the gold rings on his fingers slamming into my face.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#115:2> He senses something, " What 's your name, sweetheart?"
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#116:2> The other men lean forward over the seat.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#117:2> A torrent explodes: " I ain't your sweetheart, I ain't your

bitch, I ain't your baby.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#118:2> How dare you have the nerve to sit up here and talk about women that

way, and then try to speak to me."
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#119:2> The woman/mother chimes in to the beat with claps of sisterhood.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#120:2> The men are momentarily stunned.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#121:2> Then the comeback: " Aw, bitch, don't play that woman shit over here 'cause

that 's bullshit."
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#122:2> He slaps the back of one hand against the palm of the other.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#123:2> I refuse to back down.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#124:2> Words fly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#125:2> My instinct kicks in, telling me to get out.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#126:2> " Since I see you all are not going to move, I will."
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#127:2> I move to the first car.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#128:2> I am so angry that thoughts of murder, of physically retaliating

against them, of separatism, engulf me.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#129:2> I am almost out of body, just shy of being pure force.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#130:2> I am sick of the way women are negated, violated, devalued, ignored.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#131:2> I am livid, unrelenting in my anger at those who invade my space,

who wish to take away my rights, who refuse to hear my voice.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-013#132:2> As the days pass, I push myself to figure out what it means to

be a part of the Third Wave of feminism.
<ICE-USA:W2B-013#133:2> I begin to realize that I owe it to myself, to my little sister on

the train, to all of the daughters yet to be born, to push beyond my rage and

articulate an agenda.</p> </I>
