RESISTANCE</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#3:1> High technology networks make possible the deluge of texts

surrounding us.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#4:1> We swim in the flow of information, and are provided with ( or drowned

within) interpretations and representations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#5:1> High technology has changed the way capital functions, and makes

possible the electronic format of this journal.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#6:1> A new relationship between bodies and technologies is, seemingly,

unprecedented in modern capitalism.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#7:1> Donna Haraway, in her <quote> Manifesto for Cyborgs"</quote>(1985),

writes of a post-natural present in which <X> <quote> Late twentieth-century

machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and

artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many

other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X8:1> Our machines are frighteningly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly

inert</quote> ( 152).</X></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X9:1> After all, the human capacity to generate or make sense of

information has been surpassed by computers, and challenged by the deluge of

texts ( literal, aural, visual) that surround us.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X10:1> Baudrillard 's response to this deluge is triggered by a quick spin

of the radio dial: <quote> I no longer succeed in knowing what I want, the

space is so saturated, the pressure so great from all who want to make

themselves heard</quote> ( 132).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X11:1> Theorists from many disciplines are engaged in the process of

articulating the function and effects of high technology; many have argued,

as Baudrillard has, that the human condition has been transformed by the

encounter with the unique and unprecedented power of high technology.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X12:1> Assuming a material uniqueness in the encounter with high technology

is dangerous; this assumption obviates important precedents that may help us

to strategize some resistance to a <quote> gradual and willing accommodation

of the machine" </quote> ( Gibson, 203).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X13:1> Freud 's clinical methods, and his construction of the relationship

between patient and therapist, for example, are strikingly similar to the

current encounter between bodies and technologies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X14:1> A look at Freud 's account of his treatment of Dora makes obvious

this decidedly low-tech version of a <quote> deluge of texts,</quote> and

shows the way in which this therapeutic construct incorporated resistance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X15:1> What are the possibilities for resistance to this new deluge?
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X16:1> This question has provided the impetus for a vital, and absolutely

necessary, discussion of strategies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X17:1> As I will show in this essay, these responses are symptomatic of the

failure of resistance to technologies of the early twentieth century.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X18:1> Strategies of resistance are often incorporated into systems,

strengthening that which is being resisted.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X19:1> Juliet Mitchell has described the function of this resisting space:

<X> <quote> [Resistance] is set up precisely as its own ludic space, its own

area of imaginary alternative, but not as a symbolic alternative.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X20:1> It is not that the carnival cannot be disruptive of the law, but it

disrupts only within terms of that law</quote></X> ( Mitchell, 1982).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X21:1> I hope to provide some strategies, and historical warnings, that

may help one actualize and resist power at a time when the possibility of

doing so seems dismal.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X22:1> Haraway reminds us, with hope and pragmatism, that <quote> we are

not dealing with technological determinism, but with a historical system

depending upon structured relations among people</quote> ( 165).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X23:1> This <quote> historical system</quote> includes the interaction

between bodies and technologies and the implications of these encounters,

which are referred to in this essay as <quote> cyborg politics.</quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X24:1> The origin of cyborg politics doesn't begin with the late twentieth

century, however, but with the broad tradition of positing scientific and

technical solutions to free humans from pain and to solve problems of the

human condition, particularly problems that originate not with the machine or

technology, but within the body.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X25:1> Foucault has given us a description of the emergence of

bio-technical power in the seventeenth century; his description of this power

maps onto our twentieth-century concern with bodies and technologies:</p> <X>

<quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X26:1> Discipline may be identified neither with an institution nor with an

apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a

whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application,

targets; it is a <quote> physics</quote> or an <quote> anatomy" of power,

a technology.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X27:1> ( 206)</quote></X></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X28:1> Within an early twentieth-century Foucaultian formation, Freud

emerges as the mental technologist and industrialist, producing the truth of

mind and body within the critical tools of psychotherapy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X29:1> Freud constructed a method whereby the mind, largely abandoned to

the world of religious therapies, was treated by empiricists, and built upon

the work of the psychiatrists of the French school: Charcot, Georget, and

Pinel ( Goldstein, 134-166).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X30:1> Psychotherapy was a new disciplinary technology, unique unto

science because it treated the mind as a machine ( a method previously

visited upon the body).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X31:1> Freud ushered in the Western twentieth century with this

industrialist approach to the soul, fracturing the inner self in two: <quote>

conscious</quote> and <quote> unconscious</quote> drives.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X32:1> Within this new science, and in Freud 's clinical approach, the

Cartesian dualism of mind/body breaks down: <quote> mind</quote> has been

divided into conscious/unconscious.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X33:1> As a result, <quote> mind</quote> is no longer one unitary term

that can correspond to its binary opposite, <quote> body.</quote> This

disruption could be promising: mind/body corresponded to male/female, and it

would seem that this pair of binary oppositions would no longer be able to

function with respect to gender.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X34:1> Yet this deconstruction of oppositional pairs serves to strengthen

others, and raises some thorny questions for Freud 's treatment of Dora.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X35:1> What, then, becomes of the relationship between mind and body

within the Freudian construct?
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X36:1> If there is a disruption of the mind/body dualism when the <quote>

mind</quote> has been fractured into two distinct entities, how does this

affect clinical practice?
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X37:1> Freud changed these pairs or, at the least, expanded the way they

function: the patient 's experiences, as described by the patient, were

informed by the unconscious mind in a way that was not evident to the

patient.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X38:1> In deconstructing the mind/body separation, Freud constructed a new

oppositional pair in its place, that of the conscious/unconscious.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X39:1> The relations between the conscious mind and body were obvious to

the patient, but those were less important for fixing the machine than was

the relationship between the unconscious mind and body.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X40:1> If this relationship was the arbiter of the body 's functions and of

the conscious mind, how could one go about fixing it?
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X41:1> One couldn't; a therapist had to be called in for repair. The

<quote> unconscious</quote> drives were given over to the interpretation of

the therapist.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X42:1> In treating the machinery of the mind, Freudian therapists were

given the interpretive duty of constructing desire and representing the inner

self. Philip Reiff, in his introduction to <it> Dora</it>, captures the

perfect circularity of Freudian psychotherapy as enacted in clinical

practice:</p>

<p> <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X43:1> By presuming the patient incapable of an impartial judgment, the

therapist is empowered to disregard the patient 's denials....
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X44:1> A patient says: <quote> You may think I meant to say something

insulting but I've no such intention....
< 've-USA:W2A-003#X45:1> From this the analyst may conclude, <quote> So, she does mean to

say something insulting....</quote> </quote> ( 15)</X></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X46:1> It is also evident in Reiff 's description that resistance

against a therapist is incorporated, and neutralized, within therapy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X47:1> The Freudian therapeutic situation is a cybernetic network in which

resistance functions to support the system.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X48:1> It is in this clinical practice that any potential disruption of

dualisms promised in Freudian theory were recuperated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X49:1> That Freud has constructed an impenetrable defense for the therapist

is obvious.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X50:1> In retrospect, it 's easy ( albeit reductive) to view Freud 's

incorporation of resistance into therapies ( as a prerequisite for therapy)

as a frustrated empiricist 's attempt to fit the mind into the structure of

empiricism.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X51:1> The patient/therapist opposition was constructed in place of the

mind/body opposition, and re-enacted as male/female.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X52:1> Perhaps Freud 's construction of an impenetrable position for

therapists, and an utterly penetrated position for patients, created a

backlash against the material moment when male/female became disengaged from

mind/body.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X53:1> At any rate, the context is utterly changed for a patient of

psychotherapy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X54:1> The beginnings of an answer to the question of gender difference in

the therapist/patient relationship lie in asking the following question: Who

is treated and why?
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X55:1> Men were rarely caught on the <quote> penetrated"side of the

therapist/patient relationship.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X56:1> Although male/female no longer enacted mind/body, another structure

excluded men from needing this interpretive therapy: the impetus for

treatment is resistance on the part of the patient.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X57:1> Philip Reiff characterized the category of patient in his

introduction to <it> Dora</it> when he wrote that, <quote> the neurotic

makes too many rejections</quote> ( 16).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X58:1> Although men were no longer excluded from the category of

patient, having unconscious drives themselves, the prerequisite for treatment

was often hysteria or neurosis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X59:1> Hysteria was a term used to categorize actions seen, historically,

as being particular to women, although Freud and the Paris school 's

characterization of hysteria did not expressly exclude men.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X60:1> Jan Goldstein has documented that hysteria was flirted with by most

of the nineteenth-century French male novelists, and she argues that the

literary interest in such a disease <quote> included as one of its

components a fascination with this 'otherness,' a tendency to recognize in it

aspects of the self and to enlist it in the service of

self-discovery</quote> ( 138).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X61:1> Goldstein 's theory would also explain why Flaubert never entered

into therapy, despite identifying himself as an hysteric.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X62:1> In his fiction, Flaubert wrote of hysteria only through female

characters, as did all the other French novelists mentioned in Goldstein 's

essay.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X63:1> Dora 's treatment, after all, was not in the interest of

self-discovery, but in the interest of her father.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X64:1> Dora had been brought to Freud in an effort to get Dora to accept

her father 's affair with Frau K.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X65:1> The father also needed Dora to respond to Herr K so that he could

get his game of partner-swapping to continue to go smoothly: he attempts to

swap <quote> partners</quote> with Herr K by offering his daughter, Dora,

to Herr K, in exchange for Herr K 's wife.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X66:1> This play of substitutions, begun by the father, certainly asks to

be seen as a machine.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X67:1> This is a desiring machine in which substitutions can be made: there

are slots to be filled ( so to speak) that eclipse an individual desire to be

in that position.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X68:1> This is particularly true in Dora 's case.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X69:1> When Dora was put into treatment, Freud writes that <quote> [s]he

objected to being pulled into the game entirely, at the same time she was

fascinated by it and wanted to play</quote> ( 34).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X70:1> By the time treatment had begun, Dora was suicidal, and had been

resisting Herr K. 's advances, the first of which occurred when she was 14

years old. <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X71:1> " He suddenly clasped the girl to him and pressed a kiss upon her

lips.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X72:1> This was surely just the situation to call up a distinct feeling of

sexual excitement in a girl of fourteen who had never before been approached.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X73:1> But Dora had at that moment a violent feeling of disgust and tore

herself free from the man ..."</quote> ( 43).</X></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X74:1> Freud writes that <quote> the behavior of this child of

fourteen was already entirely and completely hysterical" </quote> because she

did not have the <quote> genital sensation which would have certainly been

felt by a healthy girl in such circumstances</quote> ( 44).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X75:1> Dora 's resistance to Herr K. 's advances provided Freud with the

cornerstone of the psychology of the neuroses: reversal of affect.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X76:1> Without Dora 's bodily resistance to Herr K., Freud would never have

been able to treat her in the first place.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X77:1> Without Dora 's repeated verbal resistance to Freud 's suppositions,

he couldn't have written in the <quote> repressed</quote> desires for

nearly everyone in the <quote> game."</quote></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X78:1> Interestingly enough, in his interpretation of Schreber 's <it>

Memoirs of My Nervous Illness</it>, Freud didn't perceive any indications

that this approach could inhibit treatment by negating the patient 's

interpretations. Freud 's textual analysis of the <it> Memoirs</it>, titled

<quote> Psychoanalytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of

Paranoia ( Dementia Paranoides)"</quote>, ignores the obvious: Schreber is

able to treat himself via his own process of writing and interpretation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-003#X79:1> Schreber writes of his <quote> gratitude</quote> toward

Professor Fleschig, his doctor, for helping Scheber to recover, but in a

manner <quote> so hedged with doubts and reservations that it subverts the

expressed appreciation</quote> ( Chabot, 16).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X80:1> Schreber doesn't give credit for his recovery to the doctor who was

in charge of his treatment, and blames this on the doctor 's inability to

recognize his patient as <quote> a human being of high intellect, of

uncommon keenness of understanding and acute powers of observation</quote> (

<it> Memoirs</it>, 62).
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X81:1> What does this tell us about Freud 's understanding of Schreber 's

treatment?
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X82:1> Freud didn't extrapolate Schreber 's therapeutic process to his own

clinical method; he ignores that Schreber 's experience points to the healing

power of a patient 's interpretation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-003#X83:1> The patient 's story, moreover, must not be systematically negated,

as in the treatment of Dora.</p> </I>
