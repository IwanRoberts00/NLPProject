<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#1:1> Four times in the last five innings Wednesday, the Bozeman Bucks

AA baseball team got their leadoff man on base against the Billings Scarlets.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#2:1> But the Bucks managed to score only once in those five frames as the

Scarlets beat Bozeman 5-1 in Class AA conference action at Legion Field.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#3:1> Both teams got solid pitching from their starters, but the

Scarlets scored once in both the second and third innings before posting two

runs in the fourth and adding another run in the fifth off Bozeman starter

Mark Bolin.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#4:1> Bolin went the distance for the Bucks in the losing cause while

Billings starter Casey Reichenberg gave up one run on five hits in seven

innings of work for the victory. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#5:1> Despite the loss, Bozeman coach Shane Miller wasn't too

disappointed with his squad 's effort against the defending AA state

champions.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#6:1> The Bucks beat the Scarlets 9-8 Tuesday night on Josh Huey 's

ninth-inning solo home run to earn a split. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#7:1> " I thought our pitching was pretty effective although we did make

a few errors in the field," Miller said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#8:1> " I mean it 's not like they came in here and pounded us today. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#9:1> " I'm pretty proud of m 'mguys and the way they played against the

state champs these last two days." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#10:1> Bozeman ( 20-9 overall, 6-3 conference) threatened in the bottom

of the ninth when shortstop Jesse Miller led off with a single to center and

advanced to second on a wild pitch with no outs.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#11:1> But Billings reliever Kyle McBride retired the next three Bozeman

batters in order to secure the victory for the Scarlets ( 36-7, 10-3). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#12:1> Billings coach Paul Hatzell felt his team could have put the

Bucks away early in the game, but credited his pitchers and team defense for

holding Bozeman to just one run. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#13:1> " We went 1-2-3 in the first inning, but then left eight guys on

base in the next four innings, so our hitters didn't produce the way I would

have liked," Hatzell said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#14:1> " I told our guys they have to maintain their focus through all nine

innings.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#15:1> We weren't very disciplined at the plate, but we had good pitching

and defense and that was the difference." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#16:1> Reichenberg 's offspeed pitches gave Bozeman batters trouble all

day.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#17:1> Bucks third baseman Adam Lawson tripled in the bottom of the first,

but Reichenberg retired the Bucks in order in the second, third and fourth

frames. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#18:1> Bozeman 's leadoff batter, second baseman Jake Phillips, scored

the Bucks only run in the bottom of the sixth after singling to right field

and advancing to third on a wild pitch and a fielder 's choice.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#19:1> When Zach Weidenaar hit a soft grounder to third, Lawson, who reached

on a fielder 's choice, got caught in a rundown between second and third.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#20:1> Phillips scored before Lawson was tagged out at second to end the

inning, making the score 5-1 Scarlets. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#21:1> Despite giving up hits to the leadoff batter in the fifth, sixth

and seventh innings, Reichenberg was confident he and the Scarlets could work

out of those jams unscathed. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#22:1> " I felt good; I was switching up my pitches pretty well and once

we got the lead, I felt really comfortable," Reichenberg said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#23:1> " Once we scored some runs, I just wanted to throw strikes and let

the defense do the work." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#24:1> Billings' big inning came in the top of the fourth when the

Scarlets got two runs on two hits, a walk, a sacrifice fly and two Bozeman

errors. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#25:1> However, after the Scarlets posted a run in the fifth, Bolin shut

Billings down over the final four innings.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#26:1> He retired the Scarlets in order in the sixth, seventh and eight

innings, before giving up a harmless infield single in the ninth. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#27:1> Mike Wardell led the Scarlets at the plate, going 2-for-4 with a

run scored and a run batted in while Huey went 2-for-4 to lead Bozeman 's

offense.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-008#28:2> <h> School vandal sentenced to a day in jail</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#29:2> The last of three boys involved in the vandalism of Bozeman High

School last fall was sentenced in Gallatin County District Court

Wednesday.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#30:2> Though he signed off on a plea agreement with the prosecution

Michael Roy Oltman, 18, got more than he bargained for after admitting to

District Court Judge Mike Salvagni that he drank alcohol at a friend 's

birthday party, violating his probation. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#31:2> " Oh, so are special occasions an exception to my order?"

Salvagni asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#32:2> Oltman said they weren't.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#33:2> But the judge sentenced Oltman to one day in the Gallatin County

Detention Center. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#34:2> " I want him to see the inside of the jail for 24 hours.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#35:2> I want him to understand what can happen if he violates the court

order again," Salvagni said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#36:2> Oltman was originally charged in October 2000 with felony

burglary, misdemeanor criminal mischief and misdemeanor possession of alcohol

by a minor in connection with an Aug. 29, 2000, break-in and vandalism of the

high school.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#37:2> Oltman and his friend, Billy Burton, then students at the school,

had been drinking before they dropped through a broken skylight and set off

fire extinguishers in the school. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#38:2> In exchange for his guilty plea, Oltman 's charges were amended to

accountability to burglary, a felony, and accountability to criminal

mischief, a misdemeanor.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#39:2> The charge for being a minor in possession remained the same. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#40:2> Jail time wasn't part of the plea bargain between the prosecution

and the defense.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#41:2> But neither was the chance for Oltman to wipe his record clean. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#42:2> The agreement called for a two-year deferred sentence for the

burglary charge, and six months suspended for the other two charges.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#43:2> Then, if Oltman didn't violate his probation, his felony charge would

be expunged from his record.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#44:2> Suspended sentences remain on a person 's criminal record. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#45:2> But Salvagni deferred all of the sentenced deferred, giving

Oltman the chance to clear his record. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#46:2> If he violates the conditions of his deferred sentence, like

drinking alcohol or taking drugs, the sentence could be revoked and the

prosecution could seek a harsher penalty. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#47:2> " Do you know what the maximum sentence is for burglary?"

Salvagni asked? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#48:2> " Twenty years," Oltman answered. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#49:2> Defense attorney Jennifer Bordy pointed out that Oltman was

constantly being lumped in with the second vandalism to the school, which

happened a week later during Labor Day weekend, when Burton and Matthew

Mitchell caused

&dollar;25,000 in damages to the school.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#50:2> " Except for what happened a week later, no one would have taken

this as seriously as they have," Bordy said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#51:2> " He made a mistake, a horrible mistake in judgment but he can learn

from it and move on." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#52:2> His first lesson, about the inside of the county jail, started as

soon as a sheriff 's deputy put Oltman in handcuffs and removed him from the

courtroom.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#53:2> He will be released from jail at 9:30 a.m. today. </p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-008#54:3> <h> RightNow expanding into Japan</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#55:3> Local software company RightNow Technologies is expanding its

global arms to encompass a new market. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#56:3> The company, which makes customer service software for online

businesses, has added Japan to its list of business locations. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#57:3> " The Japanese market is one of the largest potential markets

outside the United States," said Greg Gianforte, RightNow 's chief executive

officer.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#58:3> " We have high expectations." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#59:3> RightNow is already operating in several European markets, as

well as Australia, but none of those locations posed the language and

cultural problems the company faced in Japan. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#60:3> After months of working with Basis Technology, a

Massachusetts-based company that specializes in making Internet companies

international, RightNow 's software will hit the Japanese marketplace by

mid-July, said Mike Myer, RightNow 's vice president of development. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#61:3> " We worked with an outside party who are experts in converting,"

Myer said. " They took our software and produced a Japanese version." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#62:3> Moving into Japan is an important step for any company on the

Web, said Ed Schwalenberg of Basis Technology. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#63:3> " The big thing, of course, is the Japanese market is expanding

so fast, it 's the natural next step," Schwalenberg said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#64:3> " Anyone in the world can get to your Web site." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#65:3> When they see the site, they should be able to read it in their

language.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#66:3> " We've be 'veworking on internationalizing the product since

February," Myer said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#67:3> " It 's a four-month project.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#68:3> It was a sizable amount of money." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#69:3> He declined to give an exact figure for the cost of converting

RightNow 's software from English to Japanese.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#70:3> But he said part of the difficulty is the difference in the size of

the language.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#71:3> " Although RightNow was already shipping in European languages,

all of those have small alphabets of about 250 characters," Schwalenberg

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#72:3> " Japanese has about 10,000 characters." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#73:3> Making sure the search engine can read the language used in

keyword searches is also an important part of the conversion.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#74:3> " In Japanese there are no spaces between the words," Myer said.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#75:3> He explained that with the English-based software if a person

types the word " carpet" into the search engine the computer knows to look

for that particular word and not the words " car" and " pet" because there

isn't a space.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#76:3> In Japanese, the computer doesn't have the luxury of the space. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#77:3> To solve that problem, Basis Technology makes the Japanese

Morphological Analyzer, a product that dissects the text and then determines

where word breaks should be. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#78:3> " It parses through the Japanese and finds out where the words

are," Schwalenberg said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#79:3> To enter the Japanese market, RightNow has partnered with Mitsui

and Co., the largest " trading company" in Japan, which means it represents

non-Japanese companies in the Japanese market, Gianforte said. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#80:3> Mitsui is in the process of introducing the product in Japan and

has hired seven employees that are dedicated to RightNow. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#81:3> " The Japanese marketplace relies heavily on relationships,"

Gianforte said. " Essentially, ( Mitsui is) RightNow Technologies in Japan."

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#82:3> While some of RightNow 's competitors have already made the move

to the Japanese market, Gianforte said none have done so as completely as

RightNow.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#83:3> " Our normal competitors do have some presence there but they

have not taken the same path we have," he said.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-008#84:4> <h> Locomotive power plans still on track </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#85:4> Falling electricity prices have not yet put an end to Washington

Corp. 's plans to generate energy with locomotives parked southwest of Willow

Creek. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#86:4> Criticized by locals worried about constant noise and exhaust,

the locomotives planned for a remote rail siting are still a possibility,

said Linda Frost, spokeswoman for Montana Rail Link, a train company owned by

Washington Corp. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#87:4> " It is still pending.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#88:4> We' 'llmake an announcement next week," Frost said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#89:4> Right up until last week, neighbors to the locomotive site cold

see workers installing track to accommodate MRL 's plan. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#90:4> Locomotives are designed to generate electricity.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#91:4> Collaborating with Commercial Energy Corp.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#92:4> of Cut Bank, MRL planned to park six locomotives southwest of Willow

Creek and plumb the power the generated to nearby electric lines.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#93:4> A joint corporation, Rail Energy, was to supervise the venture. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#94:4> But electricity costs have dropped for the last week as the

federal government threatens to at least temporarily regulate skyrocketing

Western energy prices.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#95:4> Prices once hovering around

&dollar;300 a megawatt are now fluctuating in the

&dollar;40 a megawatt range. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-008#96:4> Making electricity with diesel locomotives isn't the cheapest

means.
<ICE-USA:W2C-008#97:4> To profit, Rail Energy planned to sell its power for

&dollar;110 a megawatt or more. </p> </I>
