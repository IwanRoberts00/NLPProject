<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#6:1> Wedding photography can be difficult in a sense that you only get

one chance to take perfect shots of the event or you miss them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#7:1> It takes a lot of practice and experience for someone to become a

professional wedding photographer.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#8:1> The internet is teeming with wedding photography tips that will teach

you how to make memorable shots the bride and groom ( and also the guests)

would really love. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#9:1> Chronicling one of the most significant moments of a couple is

taxing because it involves pressure from many people whether you are doing it

professionally or for a friend.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#10:1> It is important to understand the needs of the subject even if some

of the guests have the tendency to be complete smug.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#11:1> Part of the wedding photography tips given in this article involves

the proper attitude in the field.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#12:1> There would be instances that would require you to level down your

pride in the spirit of professionalism.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#13:1> Try to be polite and efficient by ignoring your own qualms.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#14:1> Treat it as your gift to the marrying couple. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#15:1> Being professional means arriving on the field well-prepared.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#16:1> As soon as you close a deal with the client, start doing research on

anything you need about the wedding.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#17:1> Spend time visiting the church and the reception.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#18:1> Find out the best way to get there on time.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#19:1> If possible, try to go to the location on the same time of the day as

the wedding event to familiarize your self with the lighting condition and to

get ideas on how to position the couple during photo sessions. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#20:1> You can find wedding photography tips on magazines and the

internet that specifically tackle various techniques on how to take candid

shots, group photos, and portraits. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#21:1> Sports photography is often deemed as pure form of photography.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#22:1> Sports photographers have to be skilled in capturing not only the

strength and skill of an athlete but also the underlying emotions and

ambiance found in a game.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#23:1> Sports photography tips given by experienced photographers are way

different from studio or nature photography.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#24:1> In sports photography you have to capture an eventful moment as it

happens because it does not rerun for you. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#25:1> Timing is of the essence for a sports photographer.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#26:1> Other than that are the most basic elements of photography: light and

composition, framing, content, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#27:1> Emphasis on the subject is intense in sports photography.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#28:1> That is why professionals would usually give sports photography tips

that do not only involve the elements mentioned earlier.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#29:1> Aspiring sports photographers should also be knowledgeable of the

game they are shooting.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#30:1> This would help them anticipate the momentous shots, the winning

goals, the passion of the athletes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#31:1> They have to know what might happen to the game.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#32:1> Sports photography is both mental and physical.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#33:1> Photographers have to practice more to improve their reflexes. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#34:1> There are no schools that offer professional degrees in sports

photography but there are workshops you can attend.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#35:1> From there, you will get to meet with professional photographers and

hobbyists who can be your potential mentors.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#36:1> Nonetheless, you can obtain plenty of sports photography tips on the

internet and by looking at the photographs in sports magazines. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#37:1> Best of all, you have to practice as much as you can.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#38:1> Look at sports photographs in the newspapers and magazines and try to

find the elements that made them stunning.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#39:1> Try these techniques on any sports event in your community.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#40:1> Volunteer as the official photographer for your friend 's kid who is

joining the little league.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#41:1> Go back to your high school to watch one of their football games.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#42:1> There are many athletes out there waiting for someone to chronicle

their games.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#43:1> You might easily be that person they are waiting for if you will just

grab the opportunity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#44:1> It is quite difficult to imagine if there is anything else the

best digital camera in the world cannot do.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#45:1> Photography has become just as regular a hobby as watching TV

nowadays especially when you get to share photos with family and friends as

easy as uploading a whole album to your Facebook account.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#46:1> But for professional photographers, today 's technology still has some

limitations that are not very easily resolved.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#47:1> This involves dynamic photography which is popular among landscape

photographers. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#48:1> Dynamic photography focus on capturing the different range of

brightness levels existing in a scene, more specifically, landscapes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#49:1> A landscape photograph seems dull if the photographer is unable to

capture the darkest and the lightest part of the subject.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#50:1> The challenge in landscape photography is to be able to concentrate

the eyes of a spectator inside the photograph.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#51:1> Dull landscape photographs tend to bleed through the edges of the

photograph too abruptly.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#52:1> This happens due to this lack of dynamic range. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#53:1> Dynamic photographers should improve how they handle composition

by scrupulously framing the subject.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#54:1> To achieve this, the camera is being held with the flash turned off.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#55:1> Dynamic photography requires precision when it comes to timing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#56:1> If a landscape photographer needs to wait the whole day for the best

exposure, he or she does so to achieve the effect he or she wanted.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#57:1> However, there are some who would rather rely on equipment to get the

same result.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#58:1> Professional photographers would use two to three stop blocking

filters to block the part of the landscape that receives too much brightness.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#59:1> By experimenting on blocking filters, you will be able to create

photos that truly encompass the lines and colors of the landscape.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#60:1> You may have to master other photography techniques before jumping

into the dynamic photography bandwagon as it tends to be more technical and

demanding.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#61:1> <h> Digital Photography Techniques vs. Digital Photography

Equipments</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#62:1> The usual misconception that entry level photo hobbyists have is

that they need a better camera to take better photographs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#63:1> This is not necessarily true.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#64:1> Even the oldest model of a point-and-shoot camera can take better

photos if the photographer knows some basic digital photography techniques.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#65:1> At the same time, the owner of the most expensive digital SLR is

wasting his or her time without knowing how to take pictures properly. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#66:1> If you have just started with photography, upgrading your

point-and-shoot camera right away is not required.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#67:1> You do not need to rush to a professional photography shop and

immediately swipe your credit card for that high-end digital SLR.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#68:1> It is better to hone your skills with a point-and-shoot camera before

buying a new one.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#69:1> Again, it is all about digital photography techniques and not the

equipments.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#70:1> Do not push your budget to the limit.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#71:1> Once you are ready for an upgrade, you can even buy cheaper cameras

by buying previously owned cameras on mint condition.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#72:1> There are also gadget shops that allow you to exchange your

point-and-shoot for an entry level digital SLR for an additional cost.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#73:1> Otherwise, if you do not have a camera yet, opt for a secondhand

entry level digital SLR that usually costs almost the same as a brand new

point-and-shoot camera. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#74:1> It is not about the features of the camera anyway but how you are

capable of maximizing these features to create acceptable photographs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#75:1> Before actually learning digital photography techniques elsewhere,

you have to get to know your camera by reading the instruction manuals with

the gadget on hand.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#76:1> Try to take the same subjects with different modes and effects to

find out how to use each button.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#77:1> The rest will follow once you have mastered handling your camera.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#78:1> The saying that photographers make great photographs and not the

camera rings true.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#79:1> There are people who can only afford a point-and-shoot digital camera

and yet are able take stunning shots.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#80:1> There are some who gets to flash their bulky digital SLRs and yet

their outputs fail to give justice to the gadget.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#81:1> What the latter lack is not inborn artistry but the efforts to hone

their photography skills.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#82:1> They might have ignored a digital photography guide they have seen in

some website thinking that their high-end SLR would do the trick for them.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#83:1> These people are awfully mistaken.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#84:1> How can you take great photos with a great camera if you do not even

know how to use its special features because you simply do not know anything

about basic photography?
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#85:1> Following tips and techniques from various sources that have a

digital photography guide is the second step in your research.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#86:1> The first one is studying the manual by heart.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#87:1> Grab your camera and try what those buttons can do on similar

subjects.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#88:1> That way, you get to learn how to use different camera modes for

different subjects and locations.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#89:1> You have to practice how to control exposure and lighting and most

importantly, how to use the flash.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#90:1> All these can be found in a reliable digital photography guide found

on the internet. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#91:1> Being able to produce great outputs is rewarding especially if

you have really given it enough efforts.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#92:1> There is what we call beginner"s luck in photography.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#93:1> All amateur photographers should get pass through that stage,

forward, and not the other way around.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#94:1> A digital photography guide can be your ticket to achieving that.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#95:1> <h> School Photography Tips ? Documenting School Mementos</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#96:1> Interested in school photography tips?
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#97:1> School activities are as worthy of a scrapbook page as birthday

parties or weddings.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#98:1> Children and young adults spend most of their time in school.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#99:1> There would come a time when you may have to tell something about

your past and by then, it is inevitable that your memories about school is

the first thing you would think of.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#100:1> Always carrying a camera around is never enough.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#101:1> Although it is probably the most important lesson among track loads

of school photography tips professional photographers would give you, being

trigger-happy with your camera is not the best way to learn how to take that

memorable shot. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#102:1> It is important to plan ahead especially if you are going to

document school-related events.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#103:1> Planning does not only mean packing your cameras, tripods, batteries

and other equipments.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#104:1> You also have to prepare the clothes you are going to wear, decide

and practice the shots you wanted to make or how you wanted your schoolmates

to pose for you on portraits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#105:1> Searching the internet for school photography tips is one way to

enhance your amateur shots. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#106:1> Another thing you have to consider is how to make your subjects

comfortable during photo sessions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#107:1> Remember that your friends and teachers have different

personalities.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#108:1> Some of them still need a little propping before they get to flash

those celebrity smiles.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#109:1> Others tend to dominate the whole shot which should not be the

effect you wanted for your photographs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#110:1> You have to decide the location of the photo shoot with your

subjects in mind.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#111:1> Make sure that every shot you make has a theme.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#112:1> The shots you take along the school corridor are different from the

ones you take in the cafeteria.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#113:1> Any person who gets to see the photographs would immediately notice

the distinction. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-019#114:1> Professional photographers and hobbyists would give you school

photography tips that are not just related to creating beautiful pictures.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#115:1> The more important thing is to make them meaningful may they be

portraits or candid shots.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#116:1> Practice improves your ability to choose which shots look good and

which are not.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#117:1> That is why it is advised that you try to take photographs all

throughout the school year.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#118:1> Many point-and-shoot digital camera owners are now starting to

replace their old ones with an entry-level digital SLR.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#119:1> This seems to be an inevitable trend.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#120:1> The more one uses his or her camera, the more skilled he or she

becomes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-019#121:1> In the end, he or she would demand for a better digital photography

equipment that best suits his or her newfound skill. </p> </I>
