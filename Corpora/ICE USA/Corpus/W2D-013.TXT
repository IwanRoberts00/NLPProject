<ICE-USA:W2D-013#1:1> <h> How to Lucid Dream</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#2:1> Lucid dreaming is being aware of the fact that you are dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#3:1> This awareness can range from very faint recognition of the fact (

which is often too brief and nebulous to be considered truly lucid) to

something as momentous as a broadening of awareness beyond what has ever been

experienced even in waking life.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#4:1> What a dreamer does with lucidity reflects personal tendencies and

levels of skill attained usually through experience and practice.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#5:1> Although a lucid dreamer can influence the dream 's structure,

characters, course, etc., it is not a given that a lucid dream is about what

the dreamer wants it to be about.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#6:1> Seasoned lucid dreamers who are more often lucid than not will

continue to encounter psychological and developmental challenges in the

dreamscape.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#7:1> The agreeable and the distressing, the easy and difficult, beautiful

and horrifying, are all occasioned much as they are in regular dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#8:1> But whereas a regular dream is filled with the convoluted subtleties

of the subconscious mind enumerating its issues before a largely unconscious

dreamer, a lucid dreamer has the opportunity to consciously explore at any

level.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#9:1> Lucid dreams usually occur while a person is in the middle of a

regular dream and suddenly realizes that he or she is dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#10:1> The person is then said to be " lucid", and may enter one of many

levels of lucidity.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#11:1> At the lowest level, the dreamer may be dimly aware that he or she is

dreaming, but not think rationally enough to realize that

events/people/actions in the dream are not real/pose no threat.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#12:1> At the highest level, the dreamer is fully aware that she or he is

asleep, and can have complete control over his or her actions in the dream.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#13:1> However, with low mental control your decisions could be biased not

by your opinion, but by your brain.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#14:1> You can control your dreams using the lucid dreaming methods that

follow. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#15:1> During the day, repeatedly ask 'Am I dreaming?' and perform some

reality checks whenever you remember.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#16:1> With practice, if it happens enough, you will automatically remember

it during your dreams and do it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#17:1> Keep a dream journal.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#18:1> This is perhaps the most important step towards lucid dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#19:1> Keep it close by your bed at night, and write in it immediately after

waking.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#20:1> Or you can keep a recording device if you find it easier to repeat

your dream out loud.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#21:1> This helps you recognize your common dream elements ( people from

your past, specific places, etc.), and also tells your brain that you are

serious about remembering your dreams! It will also help you to recognize

things that are unique to your dreams.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#22:1> You will be able to recognize your own " dream signs."

<p> These will be recurring things or events that you may notice in your

dreams. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#23:1> Learn the best time to have a lucid dream.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#24:1> By being aware of your personal sleepschedule, you can arrange your

sleep pattern to help induce lucid dreams.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#25:1> Studies strongly suggest that a nap a few hours after waking in

the morning is the most common time to have a lucid dream. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#26:1> Lucid dreams are strongly associated with REM sleep.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#27:1> REM sleep is more abundant just before the final awakening.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#28:1> This means they most commonly occur right beforewaking up.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#29:1> ( Sleep-onset REM is a symptom of narcolepsy.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#30:1> If you have lucid dreams right after falling asleep, you may wish to

consider seeking medical advice from a sleep medicine specialist.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#31:1> However, there are studies which show people can recall dreams after

being awakened during non-REM sleep). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#32:1> Dreams usually run in 60-minute ( Weiten Psych book 2004) cycles

during sleep.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#33:1> If you are working on dream recall, it may be helpful to try waking

yourself up during one of these cycles ( interrupted dreams are often the

ones we remember). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#34:1> Try Stephen Laberge 's mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming (

MILD) technique.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#35:1> Set your alarm clock to wake you up 4 1/2, 6, or 7 1/2 hours after

falling asleep.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#36:1> When you are awakened by your alarm clock, try to remember the dream

as much as possible.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#37:1> When you think you have remembered as much as you can, return to your

place of rest, imagining that you are in your previous dream, and becoming

aware that you are dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#38:1> Say to yourself, " I will be aware that I'm dr 'mming," or something

similar.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#39:1> Do this until you think that it has " sunk in."

<p> Then go to sleep. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#40:1> If random thoughts pop up when you are trying to fall asleep,

repeat the imagining, self-suggestion part, and try again.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#41:1> Don't worry if you think it 's taking a long time.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#42:1> The longer it takes, the more likely it will 'sink in,' and the more

likely you will have a lucid dream. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#43:1> Attempt the WBTB ( Wake Back To Bed) Technique.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#44:1> This is the most successful technique.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#45:1> Fall asleep.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#46:1> Set your alarm clock to 5 hours after you fall asleep.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#47:1> After you wake up, stay up for an hour with your mind focused on

lucidity and lucidity only.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#48:1> Go back to sleep using the MILD technique. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#49:1> Try attempting the WILD ( wake initiated lucid dream) technique.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#50:1> Basically what it means is that when you fall asleep you carry your

awareness from when you were awake directly into REM sleep and you start out

as a lucid dream.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#51:1> The easiest way to attempt this technique is if you take an afternoon

nap or you have only slept for 3-7 hours. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#52:1> Try to meditate into a calm but focused state.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#53:1> You can try counting breaths, imaging ascending/descending stairs,

dropping through the solar system, being in a quiet soundproof area, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#54:1> Listening to Theta binaural beats for an amount time will easily put

you into a REM sleep.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#55:1> See the warnings at the bottom, as these are very important. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#56:1> Another technique for overall " dream awareness" is the Diamond

Method of meditation, which can shortcut the overall learning curve, of Lucid

Dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#57:1> When one meditates, try to visualize your life, both awake and

dream-life as facets on a diamond.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#58:1> Some choose to call this " diamond" the Universe, others God, and

even " your Spirit."

<p> The point here is to begin to recognize that life is happening all at

once.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#59:1> It is only our " Perception" that arranges our dramas into linear or

" timed" order.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#60:1> So just as a diamond just is, each facet if viewed as an individual

experience, still is going on at the same time the " Dream Body" experiences

as well.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#61:1> This method is also known by Remote Viewers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#62:1> Remember it is just a slight shift in awareness that this exercise

calls for. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#63:1> Immerse yourself in the subject of lucid dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#64:1> For example, you can look on lucid dreaming websites, watch movies

with lucid dreaming ( eg. Waking Life, Vanilla sky, Inception), read books

about it, etc... </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#65:1> Try marking an " A" ( which stands for " awake") on your palm.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#66:1> Every time you notice the " A" during your waking hours challenge

whether you are awake or asleep.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#67:1> Eventually you may see the " A" in your sleep and become lucid. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#68:1> Get into the habit of doing reality checks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#69:1> Do at least three reality checks every time something seems out of

the ordinary, strongly frustrating, or nonsensical, and that habit will carry

on into your dreams.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#70:1> In a dream, these will tell you that you are sleeping, allowing you

to become lucid.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#71:1> In order to remember to do reality checks in dreams, you need to

establish a habit of doing reality checks in real life.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#72:1> One way to do a reality check is to look for " dream signs" (

elements that frequently occur during your dreams, look for these in your

dream journal), or things that would not normally exist in real life, and

then conduct the reality checks.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#73:1> When these actions become habit, a person will begin to do them in

her or his dreams, and can come to the conclusion that he/she is dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#74:1> Frequently doing reality checks can stabilize dreams.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#75:1> This is also known as DILD ( Dream Induced Lucid Dreams).
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#76:1> Some tactics include: </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#77:1> Looking at a digital clock to see if it stays constant; looking

at a body of text, looking away, and then looking back to see if it has

changed; Flipping a light switch; Looking in a mirror ( your image will most

often appear blurry or not appear at all in a dream).
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#78:1> However, your figure can be horribly disfigured in a mirror,

frightening you into nightmare or a dream.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#79:1> Pinching your nose closed and trying to breathe; Glancing at your

hands, and asking yourself, " am I dreaming?" ( when dreaming, you will most

often see greater or fewer than five fingers on your hand); Jumping in the

air; you are usually able to fly during dreams Poking yourself; when

dreaming, your " flesh" might be more elastic than in real life; a common

reality check is pushing your finger through the palm of your hand;

Pinch/poke your arm.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#80:1> In a dream, you shouldn't be able to feel your pinch/bite.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#81:1> However, this may not work since in a dream, actions can still have

effects on your body.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#82:1> Try leaning against a wall.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#83:1> In dreams, you will often fall through walls. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#84:1> Prolong lucid dreams by spinning your body or falling backwards

in the dream ( suspected of prolonging REM), and rubbing your hands (

prevents you from feeling the sensation of lying in bed).
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#85:1> Take care while spinning.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#86:1> Remind yourself even as you spin or fall that you are dreaming, as

you will find yourself in a completely different location when you stop

spinning or hit the ground and may lose lucidity otherwise.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#87:1> If you feel a dream 'shakes' or is about to fade out, look down to

the ground and visualize your surroundings, reminding yourself you are

dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#88:1> Be Pro-active about your dream.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#89:1> Have a goal in mind and try to accomplish it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#90:1> Listen to Binaural Beats.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#91:1> Binaural Beats are often used to induce lucid dreams, and many assure

this method dramatically improves success rate.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#92:1> Theoretically, listening to Binaural Beats lowers brain frequencies,

triggering different effects such as relaxation and dream induction.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#93:1> Look for Theta binaural beats, as they use the same brainwave

frequency used in dreams.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#94:1> You may also want to listen to Alpha and Delta binaural beats as they

help you relax and fall into non-REM sleep. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#95:1> " 'Look through previous dreams in your Dream Journal"'.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#96:1> If you start to notice patterns in your dreams, you will notice

dream-signs, or certain things that continue to reappear in your dreams.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#97:1> This may be as basic as all dreams are in your backyard, or all your

dreams have fans in them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#98:1> Get into the habit of doing dream checks every time you see your

dream sign, and eventually you 'll see your dream sign IN a dream, do a check

and realize you 're dreaming.. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#99:1> <h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#100:1> Modified Look at Hand Method</h>

<p> As you prepare for sleep each night, sit in your bed and take a minute to

relax.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#101:1> look at the palms of your hands for 30 minutes, and repeat to

yourself, " I will dream about", " your own dream." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#102:1> Continue to repeat this phrase, " I will dream about", " your

own dream" as you look at your hands.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#103:1> After the thirty minutes, or whenever you get tired turn off the

light and go to sleep. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#104:1> When you wake during the night, Look at your hand, and say the

same phrase.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#105:1> If you did not see your hands, remind yourself of your intent to see

your hands in the next dream. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#106:1> With consistent practice of this phrase each night before sleep,

you will suddenly see your hands pop up in front of you when dreaming, and

consciously realize, " My hands!" Oh my gosh! This is a dream. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#107:1> Lucid dreaming may be helpful for people who frequently

experience nightmares, as it gives them a chance to take control of their

dreams. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-013#108:1> It is fun to fly in lucid dreams.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#109:1> To start flying try bouncing higher and higher after each step (

while " walking" in the dream.) Some find that they need to train themselves,

while others can just think that they want to fly, and therefore lift off the

ground, and start to hover.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#110:1> You can also try walking on walls or the ceiling, as flying for the

first time can be intimidating if you are not totally convinced that you are

dreaming.
<ICE-USA:W2D-013#111:1> Many people experience flying as being very natural and very

exhilarating.</p> </I>
