<ICE-USA:W2C-007#33:6> <h> Author Jerzy Kosinski An Apparent Suicide</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#34:6> Jerzy Kosinski, 57, who in such novels as " Being There," "

Steps" and " The Painted Bird" told harsh tales of degradation and despair in

a deceptively natural and simple style, was found dead yesterday in his

Manhattan apartment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#35:6> Police said his wife, Katherina von Fraunhofer-Kosinski, found

him in the bathtub with a plastic bag pulled over his head, and called the

death an apparent suicide.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#36:6> Authorities added that a note had been found near his body, but they

declined to reveal its contents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#37:6> Kosinski 's wife, in a statement released through a publicist and

reported By the Associated Press, said: " My husband had been in

deteriorating health as a result of a serious heart condition.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#38:6> He had become depressed by his growing inability to work, and by his

fear of being a burden to me and his friends."
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#39:6> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#40:6> His first novel, " The Painted Bird," which appeared in 1965, was

a critical and popular success.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#41:6> An autobiographical work, it recounted with mounting horror the

terrible solitary journeys of a young child through an Eastern Europe

devastated by war.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#42:6> " Steps," his second novel, was published in 1968 and continued the

saga of the youth as an adult.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#43:6> It won the National Book Award in 1969.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#44:6> His 1971 novel, " Being There," was a masterful satire of

America, television and politics.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#45:6> It told of " Chance," a gardener whose only contact with the outside

world was what he saw on televison.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#46:6> Forced into the world, he becomes a popular celebrity and an oracle

sought by the rich and famous, who regarded his puzzled utterings as Zen-like

wisdom.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#47:6> " Being There" was made into a 1979 movie, for which Mr.Kosinski

wrote the screenplay.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#48:6> Peter Sellers played the role of Chance, and Shirley MacLaine also

starred.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#49:6> Melvyn Douglas won an Oscar for his supporting role.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#50:6> In 1981, Mr. Kosinski himself acted in a film, playing Bolshevik

leader Grigory Zinoviev in Warren Beatty 's " Reds."
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#51:6> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#52:6> Mr.Kosinski 's work, often depressing and almost always

disturbing, reflected a life that was as unusual as it was interesting.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#53:6> It was the very stuff of fiction.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#54:6> Born Jerzy Nikodem Kosinski in Lodz, Poland, on June 14, 1933, he

spent the first six years of his life as the only child of Jewish

intellectual parents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#55:6> With the 1939 Nazi invasion and occupation of Poland, he became

separated from his parents.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#56:6> He roamed the roads and forests of his native land, living in fear

not only of the German invader, but also of Polish peasants who seemed as

likely to show him hostility as hospitality.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#57:6> After the war, almost miraculously, he was reunited with his

parents.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#58:6> But the accumulated horrors to which he had been exposed resulted in

his being rendered mute for five years.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#59:6> He recovered to graduate from the University of Lodz, where he went

on to receive master 's degrees in history and political science.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#60:6> He continued his studies in Warsaw and the Soviet Union before

obtaining permission to study in the United States.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#61:6> He arrived in this country in 1957, working at such jobs as truck

driver and paint-scraper while working toward a doctorate in political

sociology at Columbia University.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#62:6> He eventually received a doctorate in Hebrew letters from

Columbia.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#63:6> He postponed his early studies in this country to write.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#64:6> His first book, a nonfiction work, " The Future Is Ours, Comrade:

Conversations with the Russians," was published in 1960 under an assumed

name.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#65:6> His other books included " The Devil Tree," " Cockpit," " Blind

Date," " Passion Play" and " Pinball."
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#66:6> His last book, " The Hermit of 69th Street," was published in

1988.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#67:6> His books seemed at times filled with rage and revenge, at others

simply a haunting means of recounting strange parables.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#68:6> They featured themes such as the struggle of the individual against

an increasingly regimented world and the confusion caused by the blurring of

distinctions between reality and fiction.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#69:6> He always wrote in English, saying that he was not able to work in

either Polish or Russian.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#70:6> Mr.Kosinski said that he had learned English by attending films

and memorizing poetry.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#71:6> When he began to write, he worked late at night and would call "

directory assistance," relying on the telephone company to answer questions

about grammar and syntax.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#72:6> He told a reporter: " I got incredible advice.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#73:6> I did it hundreds of times - - I still do it." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#74:6> Another unusual facet of his methodology was the employment of "

editors" to work with him while he wrote his novels, and he was accused of

plagiarism for this practice.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#75:6> Writing for the Village Voice, he disputed the allegations.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#76:6> The New York Times reported that the allegations had actually been

instigated by Poland 's military government of the time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#77:6> Mr.Kosinski had served as president of PEN from 1973 to 1975, was

a director of the International League for Human Rights from 1973 to 1979,

and was active in the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#78:6> In recent years, he had returned to Poland, where he spoke of

reconciliation between Poland and the West and ethnic Poles and Polish Jews.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#79:6> He also had taught at Princeton, Yale and Wesleyan universities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#80:6> His first wife, the former Mary Hayward Weir, died in 1968.</p>

<ICE-USA:W2C-007#81:7> </h> Shoppers crowd buy-ways of longest yard sale</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#82:7> Is it the world 's longest yard sale or a linear parking lot?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#83:7> The heaviest concentrations of goods for sale have traditionally

been along the 200-mile stretch of road from Signal Mountain to Jamestown,

Tenn.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#84:7> Organizers are expecting even more than last year 's 40,000

shoppers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#85:7> Officially, the event begins today, but buyers and sellers

already have been active.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#86:7> Throngs of hawkers have erected tables and tents on grassy

roadsides and gawkers are in pursuit of priceless treasures at bargain

prices.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#87:7> Throughout the weekend, thousands will be searching for

everything from undiscovered Picasso etchings to collections of

Elvis-on-velvet paintings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#88:7> " My dealers set up and started selling on Tuesday," said Linda

Cannon, co-owner of the Antique Station in Walden.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#89:7> By Wednesday morning, her parking lot was full and shoppers filled

her store and kept the 25 outside vendors busy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#90:7> For the weekend, Mrs. Cannon hired an off-duty school-crossing

guard to help people cross the road.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#91:7> And Walden police have set up tape and barricades to prevent parking

on the road shoulder and keep traffic slowdowns in the town to a minimum.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#92:7> But antique dealers and other businesses in the town protested.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#93:7> Prohibiting roadway parking was a compromise solution.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#94:7> Other than that fatal accident, most yard sale problems have been

finding parking, potables, potties and enough cash and trunk space for the

must-haves found along the way.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#95:7> The sale began in 1987 as the brainchild of the Fentress County,

Tenn., Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#96:7> They planned their vacation around attending the sale and made

reservations months ago to stay in Crossville, Tenn., and Danville, Ky.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#97:7> " I came prepared this year," said Mrs.Evers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#98:7> " We're 'reling an empty horse trailer behind our van.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#99:7> Last year I ran out of room and had to go home - - it looked like "

Sanford & Son" when we went home.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#100:7> We had a seed cleaner tied atop the van and the inside was full of

primitive farm equipment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#101:7> " My advice is to take your time and don't get in a hurry - -

you might miss something," she said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#102:7> That shouldn't be a problem Saturday, as traffic across the

mountain is expected to be at a near crawl by then.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#103:7> In years past, Mrs.Cannon has spent the night sleeping in a bed

that was for sale - - or even on the floor of her shop - - because she was

afraid she'd 'dot be able to get up the mountain when customers and dealers

throw off the tarps and start shopping with the first rays of sun.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#104:7> " About Thursday night I'l 'llo around and tell everyone I'm 'mt

going to do it next year," said Mrs.Cannon.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#105:7> " But the dealers from Texas, Canada and California are already

asking for the same spaces for next year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-007#106:7> It 's just a zoo, but it 's also a lot of fun."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-007#107:7> Of course, if you 're not a shopper, now is a good time to find

another route.</p> </I>
