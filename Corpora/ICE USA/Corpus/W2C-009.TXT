<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#1:1> KNOXVILLE - - The University of Tennessee football team 's first

practice in pads, the supposed tempo-setter for the rest of the preseason,

was dragging horribly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#2:1> The anticipated extra-loud whacking of pads sounded instead like a

stickless drummer tapping on cotton bales.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#3:1> The grunts and groans that accompany the strain and excitement of a

Tennessee drill? Mice scurrying through the attic arouse more attention.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#4:1> The pessimists shook their heads as head coach Phillip Fulmer

halted the mano a mano Tuesday morning.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#5:1> He too was looking for the feverish, heart-thumping pitch of a

Tennessee team 's first day in pads.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#6:1> " We weren't where we wanted to be.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#7:1> We went through two or three shots there and it was obvious that the

intensity wasn't there," Fulmer said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#8:1> " We were dragging," fullback Will Bartholomew said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#9:1> " We needed somebody to slap us in the face." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#10:1> Fulmer slapped, calling the team together to preach briefly about

demands, desires and necessities for success.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#11:1> " The Tennessee drill is something we take great pride in, and I

was pleased with the response when we started the drill over," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#12:1> " They're a young football team and it 's up 're us as a staff to lead

them and get them ready for different situations.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#13:1> It was what we expected and wanted." </p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#14:1> <h> The expected intensity flourished.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#15:1> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#16:1> " It was welcome to the jungle, like you're a piece of meat

thrown into a 'refight," said Victor McClure, a freshman defensive end from

Soddy-Daisy.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#17:1> " It was rough on me.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#18:1> I got too high both times.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#19:1> But it was exciting.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#20:1> I love putting on the pads.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#21:1> I love going one-on-one." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#22:1> Winning the one-on-one battles will be a recurring theme

throughout the season, Bartholomew said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#23:1> " The Tennessee drill is more of a team attitude drill," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#24:1> " It 's about being mentally tough, and I have no doubt this is going

to be one of the hardest-hitting summers we've ever had.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#25:1> T 've 's my kind of football." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#26:1> It 's really what football - - and the Tennessee drill - - are all

about.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#27:1> " You can't play football in shorts," Fulmer said after Tuesday

morning 's practice.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#28:1> " I look at this morning as the official opening of the season.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#29:1> You have to put on pads and see who 's willing.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#30:1> If they let you play two-hand tag all the time, it would be a

completely different game." </p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#31:1> <h> Fulmer Misses Practice </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#32:1> The head coach left campus right after his meeting with the media

to fly to Winchester, Tenn., where his mother ( Nan Lee Fulmer) was having

emergency surgery.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#33:1> He missed Tuesday afternoon 's practice, leaving assistant head

coach John Chavis in charge.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#34:1> <h> Ofenheusle 's new home </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#35:1> Will Ofenheusle 's move to right guard ( from tackle) is taking on

the look of permanency.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#36:1> " I'm glad they moved me.
<ICE-USA: 'mC-009#37:1> I have the challenge of learning a new position and it gives you a

completely different perspective on the game.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#38:1> It looks like I'm going to be there," he said.</ 'm
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#39:1> <h> One-Liners </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#40:1> Sophomore Anthony Herrera was back with the first team, working

at left guard in place of Champion ( Fred Weary was at center, Ofenheusle at

right guard, Reggie Coleman at left tackle and Michael Munoz at right tackle. .. .
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#41:1> Northwest Whitfield 's Sean Young is running second team at right

tackle.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#42:1> True freshman Rashad Baker worked exclusively at cornerback

Monday and Tuesday, " and he looks like he has a real chance to be a special

player over there," said Fulmer.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#43:1> " Well continue a couple of more days working him both ways and then

make a decision as to where he can best help this football team."
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#44:1> In the next breath, however, Fulmer pretty much sealed Baker 's fate

when he said, " Mark Jones has made some really nice strides as a receiver

and ( fellow freshman) Tony Brown has shown he can help this team.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#45:1> We're building really good de 're at that position." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#46:1> On quarterbacks Joey Mathews, A.J. Suggs and Casey Clausen,

Fulmer isn't discouraged, but he 's having to stretch his patience.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#47:1> " At times our quarterbacks are doing what we need to get done and at

times they're just not as consistent 're they need," he said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#48:1> " Some of it is experience and some of it is their need for more

intensity and concentration on each play.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#49:1> If continue to understand that, we'll be more efficient the 'll" </p>

<ICE-USA:W2C-009#50:2> <h> Growth healthy for local insurers</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#51:2> <h> Chattanooga 's biggest health insurers are helping insure a

healthy job market for local workers. </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#52:2> Cigna Healthcare, which has boosted its Chattanooga staff by more

than 50 percent over the past two years, could add up to 300 more jobs in the

next 18 months as part of its ongoing expansion in Chattanooga.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#53:2> UnumProvident, the world 's biggest disability insurer, is already in

the midst of a similar staff addition.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#54:2> And BlueCross and BlueShield of Tennessee, the state 's largest health

insurer, recently added 60 employees at its Chattanooga headquarters to

service a new Medicare contract in New Jersey.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#55:2> " There 's a lot of opportunities right now for workers in this

field," said Sandra McFarland, vice president of operations at Olsten

Staffing Services, which has helped recruit and hire hundreds of workers for

UnumProvident.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#56:2> " We have to do things a lot differently than we did five years ago

to find enough qualified people.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#57:2> Across the country, recruiting is a real challenge." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#58:2> But as the home of two of the largest insurance companies in the

South - - and field offices for several others spun off from those two - -

Chattanooga has developed a pool of talent to staff such insurance

operations.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#59:2> To help keep that base, city and county governments are also moving

this month to provide some tax relief for Cigna 's growing operations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#60:2> " We have a well-qualified work force for this business in

Chattanooga," said Steve Hiatt, manager of business development for the

Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#61:2> " With all of the insurance business we have in Chattanooga already,

I think Cigna realized the advantages of building its business here.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#62:2> We tried to put together a very competitive package." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#63:2> The Chattanooga Industrial Development Board is slated this month

to approve a financing package to cut Cigna 's property taxes on equipment in

half for the next five years.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#64:2> Since 1998, Cigna has invested more than

&dollar;13 million in personal property improvements and

&dollar;2 million in real property improvements at five different offices in

Chattanooga.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#65:2> Those investments have helped create 600 additional jobs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#66:2> In the second phase of Cigna 's expansion now under way, the

company is investing another

&dollar;4 million to create another 400 to 600 more jobs, according to documents

prepared for the city and county.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#67:2> Currently, Cigna has about 2,000 of its own employees and another

200 contract workers employed in different company divisions in

Chattanooga.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#68:2> " We expect that in the next 18 months, that number is going to

go to about 2,500 employees with the same or more numbers of temporary

workers," said John Sorrow, regional director for Cigna Healthcare 's East

Tennessee division.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#69:2> David Feng, corporate relations spokesman for Cigna, said the

exact number of additional employees hired in the future depends upon how the

business fares.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#70:2> " We do have additional office capacity for expansion in

Chattanooga and we will continue to grow as needed," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#71:2> Cigna 's cross-town rival, BlueCross and BlueShield of Tennessee,

also expanded its staff this summer.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#72:2> The Chattanooga-based health insurer recently added 60 employees to

help handle an

&dollar;11 million contract which began this month to process Medicare claims in New

Jersey.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#73:2> " It 's a tight labor market and that means you have to work

harder to get the right employees," BlueCross Vice President Ron Harr

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#74:2> But BlueCross 's new computer system has helped the company handle

three consecutive years of record growth in commercial business without much

more staff.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#75:2> " We're able to wo 'remuch more efficiently," Mr. Harr said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#76:2> The drive for efficiency also has led UnumProvident to

consolidate more of its staff and functions in Chattanooga.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#77:2> The company is in the process of adding about 300 more local

employees, although the overall corporation has cut staff since the merger

last year of Unum and Provident.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#78:2> Cigna Healthcare 's presence in Chattanooga is a corporate

offspring of Provident, which split off its group health insurance line to

HealthSource nearly a decade ago.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#79:2> Cigna acquired Healthsource in 1997 and has gradually built its

Chattanooga operations since.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#80:2> Another spinoff from Provident also is growing in Chattanooga.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#81:2> Merastar Insurance, now a division of Prudential Insurance Co., was

created from the group automobile insurance line started by Provident.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#82:2> When Prudential acquired Merastar last year, the company closed

Merastar 's claims office in Chattanooga and merged those operations with

other Prudential offices.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#83:2> But since the start of this year, Merastar employment has grown from

121 to 159 employees.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#84:2> " We anticipate still more significant growth, possibly another

50 or 60 this year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#85:2> In the year 2001, we could possibly double what we are now," said

Thomas Murphy, human resources manager for Merastar.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#86:2> " We are on our way and are going to be an integral part of the

Chattanooga insurance market." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#87:2> Merastar picked up a major account this week and has exercised

its options for additional office space at its headquarters in the Eastgate

Town Center, Mr. Murphy said.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#88:3> <h> Crime call numbers can be misleading, police say</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#89:3> When Chattanooga police padlocked the popular Whole Note on M.L.

King Boulevard last week, they pointed to the high number of calls to police

from the club/restaurant 's location as one reason for taking action.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#90:3> Records show The Whole Note and other nightspots do not rank

among the top locations police were called to in the past year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#91:3> The most frequent calls for police came from the police department 's

own headquarters, shopping malls and various locations along Interstates 75

and 24.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#92:3> For example, police responded to calls at Hamilton Place 1,183

times from July 1, 1999, to June 30 of this year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#93:3> During the same period, police responded to calls at their own

services center on Amnicola Highway 1,616 times.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#94:3> In contrast, police were called to The Whole Note 139 times during

that period.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#95:3> But comparing call volume doesn't give law enforcement

authorities a true picture of crime, said Sgt. Bobby Simpson, the officer in

charge of the department 's new civil enforcement unit.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#96:3> He included the number of calls in information he provided the

district attorney 's office on the padlocking of The Whole Note because it 's

the first question often asked, he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#97:3> Police said in the last three years there were 19 aggravated

assaults and 30 simple assaults at The Whole Note.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#98:3> An aggravated assault is one involving any type of weapon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#99:3> While police were called much more often to Hamilton Place or

other area malls, few of those calls were for violent crime.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#100:3> Exact calls for specific crimes weren't available, but police said

the vast majority of calls to shopping areas are for minor wrecks,

shoplifting, theft from cars, or helping people who had locked their keys in

their cars.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#101:3> Robin Flores' car was broken into at Hamilton Place last

weekend, and his wife 's car was stolen.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#102:3> " I'm kind 'mf skittish now about going there,'' said Mr. Flores,

an attorney and former police officer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#103:3> " I pay

&dollar;25 a month to the Police Department to get all the reports about the mall,''

Mr. Silvis said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#104:3> " We've di 'vevered a lot of erroneous things in those reports.''</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#105:3> Chattanooga 's highway system also logged a lot of police calls.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#106:3> Nine of the 20 top call locations were along Interstates 75 and 24

and on state Highway 153.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#107:3> The vast majority of those calls were for traffic accidents, police

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#108:3> Apartment complexes also produced a lot of calls.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#109:3> Woodlawn Apartments at 2300 Wilson St.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#110:3> ranked 10th; Patten Towers on East 11th Street ranked 13th; Signal

View apartments on Mountain Creek Road ranked 17th; and East Lake Courts on

Fourth Avenue ranked 18th.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#111:3> Sgt. Brian Bergenback said several hundred people live at each

of those complexes.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#112:3> A sampling of calls showed they run the gamut, from disorderly

conduct to aggravated assault.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#113:3> Sgt. Jim Massengale, the department 's crime analyst, said

there 's little to be learned by looking at the number of police responses to

a specific address.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#114:3> " At many of these addresses there 's a pay phone outside and

police simply respond to that location where someone has called from,'' he

said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#115:3> " To get a real understanding of the problem, you would have to look

at each report.''</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-009#116:3> Looking only at numbers of calls, the Police Services Center at

3300 Amnicola Highway would appear to be the city 's top problem spot,

authorities said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-009#117:3> That 's because people come into the facility to report traffic

accidents or crimes from across the city, said Sgt. Massengale.</p> </I>
