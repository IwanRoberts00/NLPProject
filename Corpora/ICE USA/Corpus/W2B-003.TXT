<p> Although the Victorian period officially ended with the queen 's death in

1901, its political and artistic cultures continue to have an unrivaled

immediacy for us.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#1:1> In recent years, conservative moralists have praised the Victorian

orphanage and recommended the Victorian virtues of thrift, cleanliness, hard

work, self-reliance, self-respect, and national pride as solutions to

American woes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#2:1> At the other end of the political spectrum, university offices of

moral sanitation issue pamphlets warning young women of date rape that recall

Victorian manuals exhorting young women to avoid " vulgar familiarity."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#3:1> John Stuart Mill 's schemes for flouting the tyranny of the majority by

plural voting have been resurrected ( albeit with the typical American

emphasis on race) by the ill-fated Lani Guinier.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#4:1> In 1995, a magnificent exhibition of Pre-Raphaelite paintings

traversed the country, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington is now

the site of a major exhibition of Victorian painters. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#5:1> But most of all it is Victorian novelists who exercise over

Americans an appeal unmatched by that of any other group of writers.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#6:1> In 1996, the Morgan Library organized a sumptuous exhibition of the

Brontes' manuscripts and memorabilia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#7:1> Television productions of the works of Charles Dickens, George Eliot,

and Joseph Conrad ( following a run of Anthony Trollope adaptations) pour

forth abundantly, and films based on the novels of Emily and Charlotte Bronte

and Thomas Hardy, though less abundant than those of the pre-Victorian Jane

Austen, also proliferate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#8:1> The Trollope Society, founded in 1987, boasts as a vice president the

current British prime minister, John Major, and flourishes mightily: in the

Seattle area, where I live, there are three separate branches.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#9:1> In the present euphoria, it came as little surprise to learn recently

that Mary Thompson, who at 120 had become the oldest living American--she

died in 1996 but did not make the Guinness Book of Records because, as the

daughter of ex-slaves, she had no birth certificate--was reported by her son

to have followed a strict regimen of reading Victorian novels every evening,

and of having them read to her when she lost her sight. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#10:1> The Victorians themselves would have found this strange; they

believed the novel was the genre least likely to survive into the next

generation, much less the next century.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#11:1> The essayist Thomas De Quincey, writing in 1848, shortly after the

appearance of Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Vanity Fair, and Dombey and Son,

declared the novel an inferior and ephemeral genre.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#12:1> " All novels whatever, the best equally with the worst, have faded

almost within the generation that produced them.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#13:1> This is a curse written as a superscription above the whole class. . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#14:1> It is only the grander passions of poetry, allying themselves with

forms more abstract and permanent," that, De Quincey said, could last.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#15:1> Mill deemed the novel an inferior genre because it could depict only

outward things like manners and scenery, not the inner man: " The minds and

hearts of greatest depth and elevation are commonly those which take greatest

delight in poetry; the shallowest and emptiest . . . are . . . not those

least addicted to novel-reading."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#16:1> Matthew Arnold told Stephen Coleridge that he had been offered 10,000

pounds to write a novel, but would not soil his hands by doing so because, as

Coleridge 's famous ancestor Samuel had said, " Novel reading spares the

reader the trouble of thinking . . . and establishes a habit of indolence."

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#17:1> Nor were disparaging opinions of this subpoetic genre limited to

poets and essayists.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#18:1> " By the common consent of all mankind who have read, poetry takes

the highest place in literature," Trollope said.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#19:1> " In his own age, [ the novelist] can have great effect for good or

evil; but we know as yet of no prose novelist who has influenced after ages. . . .
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#20:1> [ T]he novelist can expect no centuries of popularity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#21:1> But the poet adapts himself to all ages by the use of language and

scenes which are not ephemeral."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#22:1> Novelists understood better than anyone else that their characters

emerge, in part, out of historical awareness.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#23:1> Nevertheless, all of these clever people have turned out to be wrong;

and George Bernard Shaw--who said that writers who write not for an age but

for all time have their reward by going unread in all times--right. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#24:1> Far from being time-bound, the Victorian novelists have

demonstrated a staying power unequaled by their poetic contemporaries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#25:1> Is this simply because of their intrinsic artistic merit? " Dickens,"

said Leo Tolstoy, " is a genius born once in a hundred years."<ICE-USA:W2B-003#> William

Makepeace Thackeray, according to Charlotte Bronte, was on a par with the

Hebrew prophets.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#26:1> Bronte 's sister Emily was, said Matthew Arnold, a writer " whose

soul/Knew no fellow for might,/Passion, vehemence, grief,/Daring, since Byron

died" ( a reminder that it was the Victorian novelists, not the Victorian

poets, who inherited the prophetic passion of the Romantics).
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#27:1> George Eliot, whose fiction after Adam Bede ( 1859) was considered by

Victorian critics the standard by which her contemporaries should be judged,

was described by the luminaries who tried ( unsuccessfully) to satisfy her

wish to be buried in Westminster Abbey as " a woman whose achievements were

without parallel in the previous history of womankind."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#28:1> But surely all these qualities were as evident to both common and

uncommon readers at the beginning of the 20th century, when the reputation of

Dickens, for example, was at its nadir, to be revived only after World War

II, and Trollope was alleged by critics to have " disappeared." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#29:1> Let me, cautiously, suggest ( in ascending order of importance)

four reasons for the enduring--and more especially the present--appeal of

Victorian novelists. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#30:1> First, unlike most serious modern novelists, they were content to

think of themselves as popular entertainers cultivating a warm personal

relationship with their readers yet also telling them what to do or think.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#31:1> ( Until Virginia Woolf, no lengthy fiction was detached from its

teller.)
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#32:1> Who can resist the incessant direct addresses to their readers by

Thackeray and Charlotte Bronte, as in the culminating one of the 30 in Jane

Eyre?:
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#33:1> " Reader, I married him."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#34:1> Dickens used the direct address less frequently but was equally

concerned to make his readers familiar and comfortable with his voice.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#35:1> Tolstoy attributed this intimate relationship with readers to the

Victorians' affection for their characters: " The first condition of an

author 's popularity, the prime means to make people like him, is the love

with which he treats his characters.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#36:1> That is why Dickens 's characters are the friends of all mankind: they

are a bond of union between man in America and man in Petersburg."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#37:1> Thackeray, alluding to the serializations favored by him and Dickens,

said that after his characters had been " boarding and lodging with me for 20

months," he knew them thoroughly, even to the sound of their voices.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#38:1> Those of us who were brought up on the modernist writers, so notably

lacking in a tone of tender inclusiveness, now find the accents of love in

the Victorians irresistibly endearing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#39:1> ( One of these accents is the reticent treatment of sex, in contrast

to the banal explicitness of many contemporary novelists.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#40:1> We are also attracted to the Victorians by a curious mixture of

the exotic and the familiar, the time-bound and the prescient.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#41:1> If they do not offer us precisely, as Thackeray described the world

of his youth, " stage-coaches . . . riding-horses, pack-horses, highway-men,

knights in armour, Norman invaders, Roman legions, Druids, Ancient Britons

painted blue," they do give us plenty of fox hunting, dowry hunting,

Puritanism, Irish peers, Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, First

Lords of the Powder Closet, and Grooms of the Back Stairs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#42:1> We find in Victorian novels a depiction of variegated manners that

our more democratic polity lacks, a class system with clearly demarcated, yet

crossable, lines.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#43:1> We may rejoice in our freedom from the Victorian novelists' obsession

( especially powerful in Dickens and Trollope) with becoming a gentleman, and

yet be entranced by the thickness of social context in which Pip and other

aspirants to gentlemanliness pursue their quest.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#44:1> Henry James explained his own need, as a novelist, for the Victorian

English ambience in his 1879 description of " the lightness of the diet to

which [ Hawthorne 's] observation was condemned."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#45:1> Being a young American rather than a young English novelist,

Hawthorne was confronted by a negative spectacle:
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#46:1> " No state . . . barely a specific national name.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#47:1> No sovereign, no court . . . no aristocracy, no church, no clergy, no

army, no diplomatic service, no country gentlemen, no palaces, no castles,

nor manors, nor old country-houses, no parsonages, nor thatched cottages nor

ivied ruins; no cathedrals, nor abbeys, nor little Norman churches; no great

Universities nor public schools--no Oxford, nor Eton, nor Harrow . . . no

Epsom nor Ascot!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#48:1> A third reason for the Victorians' appeal is our recognition that

Victorian society, despite its differences from the contemporary world,

confronted its novelists with problems that prefigure our own: how to

reconcile democracy with traditional humanistic culture; how to create a

humane existence in the welter of urban life; how to find secular equivalents

for fading religious faith.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#49:1> Foreshadowings of our dilemmas abound in the Victorian novel.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#50:1> Lionel Trilling justified both Dickens' alleged " exaggeration" and

his interest in the mystery of evil when he wrote: " We who have seen Hitler,

Goering, and Goebbels put on the stage of history, and Pecksniffery

institutionalized in the Kremlin, are in no position to suppose that Dickens

ever exaggerated in the least the extravagance of madness, absurdity, and

malevolence in the world."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#51:1> Readers in search of early stirrings of feminism will find them in

the passionate outbursts of Bronte 's heroine in Jane Eyre and Sue Bridehead

in Jude the Obscure, as well as in the intense yearnings of Dorothea Brooke

in Middlemarch.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#52:1> Joseph Conrad 's depiction, in Heart of Darkness, of the deterioration

of imperialist idealism into a desire to " Exterminate all the brutes!" casts

a lurid, prescient shadow on the ideologues of later final solutions; his

portrait of the bomb-carrying " professor" in The Secret Agent prefigures our "

guerrillas with tenure."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#53:1> In Daniel Deronda, Eliot probed so deeply into the roots of both

Zionism and a Toynbee-esque variety of intellectual anti-Semitism that a

street is named after her in each of Israel 's three major cities.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#54:1> In The Warden, Trollope created in Tom Towers the archetype of many a

New York Times or Washington Post columnist, issuing infallible bulls from "

the Vatican of England," and " studiously striving to look a man but knowing

within his breast that he was a god."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#55:1> In Jude the Obscure Hardy depicted with tremendous sympathy the

intellectual ambition of a self-educated worker to break into the closed

circle of Oxford, an ambition akin to that of American minorities to redefine

the " mainstream" of our intellectual life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#56:1> If Pip 's quest for gentlemanly status is alien to us, the snobbish

contempt for his adoptive " father," Magwitch, that results from the very "

refinements" that Magwitch has purchased for Pip is a very American story,

familiar--alas!--to countless European and Asian immigrants.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#57:1> No single formula can encompass Victorian novelistic

imaginations.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#58:1> Dickens insisted that all novelists report their own conception of

reality from their own perspective, for " we are all partly creators of the

objects we perceive."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#59:1> But although perception is creative, commonality of purpose may

exist.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#60:1> Charlotte Bronte wrote of herself and her novelist colleagues as if

they belonged to a trade union of moral reformers, headed by Thackeray: " I

regard him as the first social regenerator of the day--as the very master of

that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of

things."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#61:1> In her insistence on the moral responsibility of novelists, their

intense concern with conduct and its consequences, we recognize a stark

contrast to the works of contemporary American novelists who subscribe to

William Gass 's dictum that " Life is not the subject of fiction" and believe

that the novel is mainly about itself or about its language.
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#62:1> It is above all a longing for what Arnold called Hebraism and a sense

that faith abandoned remains a more compelling presence in literature than

secular creeds adopted that draw us backward to the Victorians. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-003#63:1> A contemporary, W. H. Mallock, spoke of George Eliot as " the

first great godless writer of fiction that has appeared in England."
<ICE-USA:W2B-003#64:1> What this godlessness meant, exactly, is suggested by F. W. H.

Myers 's description of his conversation with the novelist as they walked in

the Fellows' Garden of Trinity College, Cambridge on a rainy evening in May

1873: " She, stirred somewhat beyond her wont, and taking as her text the

three words which have been used so often as the inspiring trumpet-calls of

men,--the words, God, Immortality, Duty--pronounced, with terrible

earnestness, how inconceivable was the first, how unbelievable the second,

and yet how peremptory and absolute the third . . . her grave, majestic

countenance turned toward me like a sibyl 's in the gloom; it was as though

she withdrew from my grasp, one by one, the two scrolls of promise, and left

me the third scroll only, awful with inevitable fates." </p> </I>
