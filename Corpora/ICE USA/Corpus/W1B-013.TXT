<p> Dear Jim,</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-013#2:1> Im writing to you, finally, on my 32nd birthday, after so much

time passing between my last letter to you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#3:1> Its not for lack of want that Ive been silent on this end; rather, I

seem to easily find ways to get myself involved in every kind of

time-consuming opportunity.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#4:1> Its in my nature, I guess, since I never seem to be able to pass up

the change to learn, to grow, to try on a new hat. </p>

<p> Ive been thinking a lot about the last time we spoke--- December 24th if

memory serves me rightand I have to say that there has been more than enough

food for thought given the circumstances.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-013#5:1> You said that it has been years since youve spoken to your oldest

son, or that he has repeatedly ignored your attempts to make peace ( which

Im sure, knowing you as well as I do, were sincere.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#6:1> I hope you can understand my point when I say that his behavior

towards you may have been warranted when he was a teenager, but it is

disconcertingly inappropriate at this point in his life.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#7:1> If I understand correctly, your son was 18 when you ran away, as you

put it, which means he was, at least legally, an adult.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#8:1> I do not have any doubt that he felt the pain of your sudden divorce.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#9:1> I dont imagine that that would be an easy situation for any person to

deal with--- his being the oldest of your kids and being the one who felt

like he was forced to be the replacement for you.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#10:1> And this may be conjecture on my part, and if it is a gross

misrepresentation of the facts, Ill ask you to forgive me, but during the

time of your divorce, I believe your ex-wife spoke of you in the most

diabolical of terms.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#11:1> This was, at least, the impression I got from my parents, who have

pretty clear memories respectively as to how the circumstances had been

related to them via your ex-wifes friends.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#12:1> There is no way your son was immune to that type of indoctrination,

for lack of a better term.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#13:1> Those were formative years for him, and he was impressionable to a

degree that was perhaps even greater than the average 18 year old, given the

idyllic childhood he experienced out on the little farm.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#14:1> He was really removed from any hardships, I think, without a job,

etc. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-013#15:1> I know that you have taken an interest in the life of Buddha, who

also lived a life totally removed from the more negative sides of life,

namely, sickness, poverty, and death.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#16:1> And he too was shocked almost to the point of depression by what he

saw when he finally left his bubble.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#17:1> I think this is partly reminiscent of your sons situation, which is

why the smack of divorce hit him so hard. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-013#18:1> Anyway, forgive me for delving into a sore topic.<ICE-USA:W1B-013#>Let me just

say that if you are ever in need of an ear, a friend, a sounding-board, a

sailing-partner, a pal to drink martinis with"as Leonard Cohen would say, - -

Im youre man. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-013#19:1> I thought I would write a little more to you about that book I

had mentioned over Christmas.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#20:1> I hate to put it like this, but it was a real pain to try to explain

the books contents to Doctor and Mrs. Naleburn, mainly because they were

only interested in hearing what they wanted to hear, if that makes sense.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#21:1> For example, I am always nervous around people who tell me that they

are excellent writers, who are the grammar police, who correct [ him]

all the time, and who cant stand to listen to the way people speak

nowadays.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#22:1> Jim, let me tell you, Ive studied the English language, and language

in general, to a degree that is much, much greater than most of the people in

the world.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#23:1> Everything I have learned has taught me that the only people who say

those things are people who were born into a kind of privilege that they

themselves dont recognize, think they earned, and would never acknowledge.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#24:1> Language, in many ways, is like music as a form of expression: One

would never tell Chopin to change the tempo of his nocturne, or tell Mozart

to stop writing for the winds, right"
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#25:1> When people become self-proclaimed grammar police, I have to wonder

what is behind their interest in, often erroneously, pointing out mistakes

in the language of others.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#26:1> Language is so closely related to personal identity that when people

are criticized for their way of communicating, it can be expected that they

will lose a deal of self-esteem.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#27:1> And Jim, Im not saying that this is the case with Mrs. Naleburn

entirely ( although I suspect it does come into play), but it seems to me

that so many of these arguments about language are really arguments against

non-white ethnic minorities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-013#28:1> Im sure that you would disagree with me on that latter point,

and I wouldnt blame you for doing so, but I hear the same types of arguments

being used all the time by people when they want to criticize anyone who is

not white.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#29:1> For instance, I was taking a break from teaching the other morning

and standing outside for one of our first spring days.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#30:1> There were three women from the building standing outside smoking and

I overheard them talking about health insurance in Massachusetts. Now, as you

know, that is a topic that is near and dear to my heart, having basically

gone broke paying for the reconstruction of the broken bones in my foot (

hey?.shouldnt all good American teachers face starvation as a result of

criminally high insurance and medical bills?).
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#31:1> So, somehow, these woman get to talking about how annoyed they are

about some illegal immigrants in Massachusetts who approached the Governor in

hopes of getting some of the Commonwealths insurance coverage.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#32:1> Boy, did these women have a lot of nasty, ignorant things to say!
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#33:1> And since Im going to hell anyway, I might as well stereotype here:

These were the South Shores trashiest of Irish white people.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#34:1> So I saw my chance to get in on the conversation by telling them, Oh

yeah, I have a story for you guys!
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#35:1> At this point, I related the following story with a straight face:

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-013#36:1> So my dad owns a small restaurant outside the city and hes been

working himself to the bones for the past twenty years to raise six kids. He

has been getting up in age and so after all that time, he finally decides to

look for a little help in the kitchen.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#37:1> One day, these two people come in, a guy and girl, who was pregnant,

and they tell my dad they are looking for a job.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#38:1> My dad asks them what they can do and they say that they are willing

to do anything because they dont have a lot of money and they want to send

money back home to their families.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#39:1> So, of course my father starts to suspect that they are illegal

immigrants when he asks them about paperwork.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#40:1> They start to explain that they have no papers and that they will

work extremely hard even without papers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#41:1> So my dad is someone who already hates illegal immigrants, so he

grabs the guy by his shirt and he says, Listen to me you dirty bastardwhy

dont you and this welfare collecting baby machine get back on the boat and

go right back to Ireland where you came from!? </p>

<p> Needless to say, Jim, they had no idea what to make of that little story.

<3> It would have been pointless to lie so blatantly about my dad, but when I

saw how they were just barely hiding their racism by using the word illegal

to mean Hispanic, I couldnt help but use the Irish example.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#42:1> You never hear people talk about the Canadians or the Irish when they

talk about immigration?.and that really bothers me!
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#43:1> I actually felt badly about duping these three brainiacs, but it was

really worth the laugh!</p>

<p> So do you think this will be another year for us to get out on the boat?
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#44:1> Id really love to get out to Misery Island this summer, but this

time, just the two of us.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#45:1> Of course, I really loved having Aunt Bard and my wife with us, but

when its just the two of us, we can really say what we want and make the

rules as we go.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#46:1> We both know that when the ladies are there, we immediately lose our

right to captain ourselves!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#47:1> I know you sort of enjoy the fact that Barb acts like the boss even

in a context in which she is entirely clueless ( i.e. the sailboat), but

getting the lecture about the gin and tonics was too much.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#48:1> Even if one didnt know that your wife and my mother were sisters,

you would know it intuitively by the way they demand adherence to their

hilarious world-view.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#49:1> What did Barb say when we were finally back and tied up to the

mooring?
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#50:1> " do you think its safe to have a drink while were still on the

boat, Jim?
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#51:1> How are you going to row us back to the shore?"
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#52:1> Boy, Jim, Ill never know how you lived without my aunt for so many

years, and how you practiced medicine without her for most of your adult

life!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#53:1> </p>

<p> Ha!
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#54:1> I cant believe I got distracted and forget to tell you about the

book.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#55:1> Well, what I would say, to finish the point I was trying to make a

few months backs, is that there are really a handful of revolutionary things

happening in the field of linguistics.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#56:1> One of them is the creation of a new theory of language proposed by a

Professor over at Tufts University, who was actually a student of Noam

Chomskys many year ago.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#57:1> And believe it or not, this man, whom I believe to be the greatest

linguist in the world, live not three block away from my house.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#58:1> The book itself is worth reading if you think you wont be bored by

looking so closely at language in such scientific terms, but it is quite an

accomplishment as far as academic works go.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#59:1> Truth be told, I am hesitant to recommend this guys book to other

linguists, though, because I have found the Professor to be somewhat

off-putting and unapproachable.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#60:1> I recently met with him to discuss PhD study under his guidance or

under his partial supervision, and he was not even willing to take a look at

the 150 page masters thesis I produced using his research---- and I can

assure you, a the time I published it, there were very, very few publications

available in which his views were being advanced by people who were not

either his grad students or his colleagues.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#61:1> In short, I felt he was just an arrogant person and I actually feel

stupid for putting so much faith into his work.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#62:1> Why should I support someone who couldnt even take a few minutes to

see what I had to offer?
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#63:1> I think it was a pedigree issue, too, since my MA degree is from

UMass and not MIT or Harvard.
<ICE-USA:W1B-013#64:1> An in a bizarre twist of fate, I actually got rejected from the PhD

program at Tufts ( after being wait-listed) only to find that the folks at

MIT are pushing me to apply! </p>

<p> Jim, youll have to forgive me for cutting this note short, but I have

got to go to sleep. I love you and cant wait to see you again!</p>
