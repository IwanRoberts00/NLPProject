<ICE-USA:W2B-021#1:1> <h> Tour ten advanced house designs from our neighbor to the north.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#2:1> Their technologies may appear in U.S.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#3:1> homes soon.</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#4:1> Probably because of its cold climate, Canada is a world leader in

energy-efficient housing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#5:1> The United States is five to ten years behind its neighbor, most

housing experts agree.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#6:1> So POPULAR SCIENCE went to Canada to learn about a group of

state-of-the-art homes, dubbed Advanced Houses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#7:1> Ten Advanced Houses, winners of a nationwide competition, have

been constructed across Canada.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#8:1> Entrants met stringent requirements: The houses will use half as much

energy as those in the well-regarded R-2000 program that Canada has been

pushing for a decade, and one-fourth the energy and half the water of

conventional homes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#9:1> Builders also focused on indoor air quality and resource-conserving

materials choices.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#10:1> These targets were met in different ways.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#11:1> " Each house is not the archetypical house of the future, but one set

of solutions," explains Tim Mayo of Canada 's energy department.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#12:1> Intended as benchmarks for the Canadian building industry, the houses

are the proving ground for new technologies and products that should drive

future housing development.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#13:1> Seven of eight windows that were prototyped for the project are now

on the market, for example.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#14:1> " We're trying t 'reush the mainstream industry as far as it can go,

and then just a bit further," says Mayo.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#15:1> Looking at the group of Advanced Houses as a whole, it is easy to

identify some emerging trends:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#16:1> * Builders are using more engineered-wood products.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#17:1> Premanufactured truss walls comprised of inner and outer wood studs

separated by plywood webs or metal spacers were used in three houses, for

example.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#18:1> This allows for wall cavities up to 12 inches deep, but uses only

small-dimension lumber.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#19:1> Only three houses have a traditional 2x6 wall-framing system.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#20:1> * Six houses are insulated with recycled materials such as

cellulose, which is made from waste newsprint.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#21:1> Two houses use newer, high-density fiberglass batts that contain some

recycled glass.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#22:1> * Three houses feature quadruple-glazed windows with gas fills,

non-metal spacers, and low-emissivity coatings that reflect heat but transmit

visible light.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#23:1> Five houses have triple-glazed windows.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#24:1> * The houses integrate space heating, cooling, ventilation, and

water heating.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#25:1> Ground-source heat pumps provide heating and cooling in three houses.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#26:1> Another four use high-efficiency systems that integrate gas heating

and domestic-hot-water requirements.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#27:1> * Occupancy sensors control ventilation in seven houses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#28:1> * Renewable energy sources are gaining a foothold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#29:1> Solar panels heat water for six houses; five of the six also have

photovoltaic-powered pumps.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#30:1> Solar energy generates electricity for two houses; another one has

wind power.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#31:1> * All but two of the houses incorporate some type of

home-automation system to control lighting, security, heating and cooling,

and more.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#32:1> The Advanced Houses will be open to the public for a year, then

sold, and finally monitored for a year under normal occupancy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#33:1> Although the houses rely on a variety of experimental technology,

they don't look out of place in neighborhoods of conventional homes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#34:1> Each house 's total project cost was about

&dollar;700,000 to

&dollar;800,000 ( Canadian); much of the expense comes from designing and installing

prototypes, which can be more costly than off-the-shelf products.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#35:1> The houses will sell for prices typical in their neighborhoods; the

three that have already sold went for

&dollar;185,000 to

&dollar;250,000 ( Canadian).
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#36:1> Here are some innovative features a visitor might see on a quick tour

of the houses.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#37:1> <h> BREATHING EASIER</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#38:1> Indoor air quality received special attention in the design of

the Manitoba Advanced House in Winnipeg.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#39:1> The hobby room, which could also serve as a home office or smoker 's

room, has its own ventilation system.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#40:1> Other " healthy house" touches include a special bag filter to

capture particles, floors made from natural cork, a basement floor sealed to

prevent the entry of radon ( a naturally occurring soil gas that may be

implicated in some lung cancers), and return air vents located in the closets

to remove dry-cleaning fumes and other pollutants.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#41:1> The Manitoba House needs no air conditioning.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#42:1> During the summer, overhangs help keep sunlight from penetrating

windows.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#43:1> The windows also have clip-on solar screens that look similar to

regular screens but reduce heat gain by about 30 percent.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#44:1> Although temperatures in Winnipeg can drop to - 40 [ degrees] F

in the winter, the house 's windows gain more energy than they lose--even on

the colder north side.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#45:1> To find the best windows for the job, the team that built the house

held a competition.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#46:1> The winner: quadruple-glazed Willmar windows with two Heat Mirror

polyester films, an additional low-emissivity coating on the inner pane of

glass, insulative spacer bars, and a gas fill that is 80 percent krypton and

20 percent argon.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#47:1> The windows have an insulative value of R-12, which is as good as

some conventional walls, says project manager John Hockman of Appin

Associates.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#48:1> Now on the market, they cost about 40 percent more than triple-glazed

windows, which are standard in new Winnipeg homes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#49:1> Other details include a natural-gas refueling station next to the

garage, an under-sink compost handler that is kept under negative air

pressure to prevent odors from escaping, and an energy-use meter that helps

reduce consumption by telling occupants how much electricity they're using 're

dollars.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#50:1> <h> SOMETHING NEW UNDER THE SUN</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#51:1> The four-bedroom Saskatchewan Advanced House in Saskatoon makes

ample use of solar energy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#52:1> A photovoltaic panel on the roof generates 1.9 kilowatts, about 10

percent of the electricity used in the house.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#53:1> The panel provides enough juice to run a Photocom refrigerator, which

uses about one-third the electricity of an average fridge ( typically the

biggest energy gobbler in a house).
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#54:1> The photovoltaics also power the heating and cooling systems.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#55:1> Surplus electricity is stored in batteries.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#56:1> Evacuated heat-pipe solar collectors on the roof capture heat and

transfer it to a 750-gallon insulated water-storage tank in the basement.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#57:1> From there, the heat passively rises into a pair of domestic

hot-water tanks mounted on top of the storage tank.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#58:1> These two tanks provide hot water for the kitchen, bathrooms, and

laundry.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#59:1> Via a heat exchanger, they also transfer heat to water circulating

through a radiant-floor-heating system.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#60:1> The two hot-water tanks provide backup heat when the solar storage

tank in the basement can't meet the demand.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#61:1> " This is a very simple system," claims designer John Carroll.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#62:1> " The three pumps are the only moving parts."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#63:1> The Saskatchewan House also has radiant cooling, which, unlike

conventional air conditioners, requires no CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#64:1> Water is pumped through 2,300 feet of tubing in the ceilings of the

main and upstairs levels, where it picks up heat from aluminum collector

plates.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#65:1> The water then flows through another 1,600 feet of tubing buried in

the ground beneath the floor slab and in the backfill.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#66:1> Cooled to about 50 [ degrees] F by the soil, the water recirculates

to the ceilings.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#67:1> To conserve water, the backyard 's concave shape channels the flow

toward the grass to water the yard.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#68:1> <h> PANELS: SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#69:1> Located in the Vancouver suburb of Surrey, the British Columbia

Advanced House uses a variety of prefabricated components.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#70:1> The second-floor walls and the roof are made from stress-skin panels,

which are stronger than conventional double-stud walls, require less lumber,

and can be mass-produced.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#71:1> " What we're real 'redoing is moving the construction off site and

into the factory, where there 's better quality control and more efficient

materials use," explains architect Richard Kadulski.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#72:1> Each stress-skin panel has a layer of HCFC-blown polyurethane

sandwiched between two sheets of plywood.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#73:1> Because they are manufactured using HCFCs ( hydrochlorofluorocarbons)

instead of CFCs, the panels are potentially less damaging to Earth 's ozone

layer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#74:1> Strolling around the house, an informed visitor can spot many

recycled materials.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#75:1> The foundation and landscaping contain crushed glass, the rubber

pavers are made from old tires, and the deck is recycled plastic.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#76:1> The roof tiles, developed by Vancouver-based C-Max Technologies, are

particularly noteworthy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#77:1> They look like slate, but are made from a fire-retardant

weather-resistant combination of two waste products: pulp sludge produced by

local mills, and a cementlike material made from a fertilizer byproduct.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#78:1> Local inventors devised two other products.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#79:1> The Touch Tap in the shower allows occupants to preset the

temperature and flow rate for each person in the house, says Kadulski.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#80:1> And the Ventex toilet, with a fan that vents odors from the bowl

through a pipe to the outside, removes about 85 percent less air than a

bathroom ceiling fan.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#81:1> Homeowners turn on another fan when they take a bath or shower.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#82:1> Household waste goes into a tank buried under the front lawn,

where microorganisms break down the solid materials.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#83:1> Only the liquids continue on to the city sewer system, reducing the

need for municipal waste treatment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#84:1> The most sophisticated element of the house is its

home-automation system.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#85:1> The house is prewired so that appliances can " talk" to each other.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#86:1> If the doorbell or telephone rings, for example, the vacuum cleaner

automatically stops.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#87:1> <h> WASTE NOT, WANT NOT</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#88:1> The Waterloo Region Green Home, located an hour west of Toronto

in Waterloo, Ontario, takes what some have called a " low-tech" approach to

energy efficiency and environmental responsibility.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#89:1> " We consider that a compliment," says project manager John Kokko of

Enermodal Engineering Ltd.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#90:1> The project team used no CFCs in the house, and selected a

variety of recycled materials including: siding made from sawdust, a steel

roof made from junked cars, carpeting made from plastic soda bottles, and a

refurbished bathtub and sink.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#91:1> One of the team 's goals was to virtually eliminate construction

waste.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#92:1> " We never had a dumpster on site," says Stephen Carpenter of

Enermodal.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#93:1> While builders typically send about 2.5 tons of waste to the landfill

for every house they erect, the Waterloo team generated just two garbage bags

weighing about ten pounds apiece.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#94:1> The team used only half the concrete that would be required for a

poured-in-place foundation by adapting engineered concrete wall panels for

the foundation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#95:1> Flat on one side, the precast panels have steel reinforcing on the

other, wafflelike side to give them the strength of a conventional

foundation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#96:1> The house 's heating system, developed with the Canadian Gas

Research Institute, uses a conventional natural-gas furnace joined to a

heat-recovery ventilator ( HRV) with two briefcase-size containers of gravel.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#97:1> Furnace flue gases and ventilation exhaust from the bathrooms heat

one set of rocks, while the second set of rocks heats incoming fresh air.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#98:1> Every five minutes, a pair of valves reverses the airflow to the two

compartments, so the heated rocks are cooled, and the cooled rocks are

heated.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#99:1> Because the rocks are cheaper than a stainless-steel heat exchanger,

the furnace/HRV system could be manufactured less expensively than its

competitors.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#100:1> It will be field-tested in 20 other Canadian houses this year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#101:1> One innovation Kokko and Carpenter can't resist pointing out is

a " toilet with a twist.?<ICE-USA:W2B-021#> Made by Control Fluidics of Greenwich, Conn.,

the Fluidizer toilet contains a blenderlike device that liquefies solid waste

and toilet paper.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#102:1> The patented toilet uses just two quarts of water for each flush;

other low-flush toilets use one and a half gallons, and standard models use

three gallons.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#103:1> The Fluidizer could become commercially available as early as

June.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#104:1> <h> ALL TRUSSED UP AND READY TO GO</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#105:1> Metal-web trusses are premanufactured units commonly used in

floors.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#106:1> " Stand that floor system on its side, and you've go 've wall," says

Paul Duffy, an engineer at Buchan, Lawton, Parent Ltd. in Toronto, and

project manager of The Novel Environmental Advanced Technology Home, or NEAT

Home, in Hamilton, Ontario.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#107:1> Truss walls provide high levels of insulation without requiring

increasingly scarce and expensive large-dimension lumber.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#108:1> " There 's nothing bigger than a 2x5 in the whole house," says

Duffy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#109:1> The NEAT Home 's 11-inch-thick walls consist of 2x3 studs

separated by a metal web.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#110:1> They'r 'reovered with insulative foam sheathing on the outside, and

drywall on the inside.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#111:1> The wall cavities are filled with a poured-in-place non-CFC foam.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#112:1> " It expands up to 60 times its volume," says Duffy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#113:1> Specially formulated for this project by Icynene Inc. of

Mississauga, Ontario, the foam flows easily around the framing materials but

does not build up enough pressure to force off the drywall or sheathing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#114:1> It shrinks less than three percent as it dries, to prevent

insulative gaps.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#115:1> Builders put scraps of excess foam into the attic before blowing

recycled fiberglass insulation into place.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#116:1> For the foundation, the project team adapted a technology

commonly used in high-rise construction.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#117:1> " It 's never been tried in a residential foundation application,"

says Duffy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#118:1> To build the foundation walls, workers used tie rods to position

rigid insulation and a fiberglass drainage layer between concrete forms.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#119:1> They then poured two layers of concrete to form a sandwich around

the insulation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#120:1> The outer concrete layer supports above-grade masonry finish, and

the inside layer supports the house framing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#121:1> There 's no need for any exterior or interior finishing of the

foundation walls.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#122:1> " When you strip the forms, you 're done," says Duffy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-021#123:1> To accommodate changing family needs, the NEAT Home has an

oversize garage door that allows the owner to add a roll-in suite to the

house.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#124:1> This suite, which arrives on the site completed like a manufactured

home, contains a bedroom, kitchenette, and bathroom.
<ICE-USA:W2B-021#125:1> Plumbing and mechanical hookups on the garage wall ease

installation.</p> </I>
