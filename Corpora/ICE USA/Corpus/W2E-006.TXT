<ICE-USA:W2E-006#1:1> <h> 'The coward 's weapons'</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#2:1> When Americans went off to fight the Persian Gulf War, one of the

greatest Threats they faced was from land mines, high-explosive metal

canisters the forces of Saddam Hussein buried by the hundreds of thousands in

the sands of Kuwait and Iraq.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#3:1> U.S. troops in Somalia face the same threat.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#4:1> At least American soldiers are accompanied by personnel trained to

locate and destroy antipersonnel mines.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#5:1> But who makes old war zones safe for the civilians, particularly

the children, who are left behind when the troops depart?
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#6:1> The answer is, no one, and the toll is devastating.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#7:1> The Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, which has been

fighting a campaign against antipersonnel mines, estimates they kill 4,000

people every month in Angola alone.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#8:1> In Cambodia, where land mines have been used in war for decades, one

in every 236 people is an amputee.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#9:1> According to the U.S. State Department, 1-million children in

Afghanistan have been killed or injured by antipersonnel mines.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#10:1> As many as 100-million of the potentially lethal mines lie buried

in places such as Kuwait and Iraq and Somalia and Angola and Mozambique, and

no one knows exactly where.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#11:1> The United States, which makes land mines, has stopped exporting

them.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#12:1> Congress passed a one-year moratorium in 1992, and last fall extended

it in other three years.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#13:1> It should have happened sooner.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#14:1> The United States was one of the 53 countries that signed a 1981

United Nations convention limiting the use of mines, among other weapons,

against civilians, but Presidents Reagan and Bush never submitted the

agreement to the Senate for ratification.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#15:1> Now the Clinton administration has taken the lead through the

U.S. representative to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, who has called

land mines " the coward 's weapons of choice.?
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#16:1> The United States has asked the 40 nations that manufacture

antipersonnel mines - the leading exporters are Russia, Italy and China - to

stop for at least three years.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#17:1> Albright persuaded 75 other nations to sign on to a successful

General Assembly resolution calling for a global moratorium on land mine

export.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#18:1> Moreover, the United States has earmarked

&dollar; 20-million to develop land mine detection-and-clearing technology and to

train people living in and around war zones in the use of the technology for

the protection of themselves and their families.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#19:1> It 's frightening to imagine how many have been maimed or killed

in the 12 years that have passed since the Reagan administration turned its

back on the first effort by the United Nations to begin the process of

ridding the world of land mines.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#20:1> But the process has begun now.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#21:1> The United States can't solve the problem alone, but it is to the

credit of the Clinton administration that we are trying, and we are actively

and successfully recruiting other nations to join the effort.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#22:1> <h> Applause for news of Annenberg 's donation</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#23:1> Congratulations to the St. Petersburg Times for giving the most

important progressive and humanitarian news of this decade front page

coverage! I'm referring to Walter Annenberg 's d 'mation of a

half-billion-dollars to education! Finally, there was news that kicked off

Michael Jackson and ( almost) Marla 's

&dollar; 2-million tiara.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#24:1> With most charitable institutions regretfully reporting less revenues

than past seasons, this is a memorable gesture.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#25:1> <h> Shock vs. therapy</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#26:1> In light of the surprisingly strong showing of anti-reform

candidates in Russia 's parliamentary elections, American officials are now

suggesting that Western governments should relax their insistence on

so-called " shock therapy" for the Russian economy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#27:1> They say the election results sent a powerful message that the

Russian people are growing weary of sweeping economic reforms that have not

yet had a positive effect on their daily lives.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#28:1> Strobe Talbott, the Clinton administration 's top Russia

specialist, says Washington should now concentrate on helping President Boris

Yeltsin 's government provide " less shock and more therapy for the Russian

people.?
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#29:1> That 's sensible advice.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#30:1> Grand economic theories sometimes must give way to hard political

realities.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#31:1> Russia 's government now faces the very real need to act to ease the

short-term pain of economic reform, even if that means slowing the pace of

the transition to a market economy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#32:1> Otherwise, millions of Russians will become even more susceptible to

the demagoguery of old Communists, or of new-styled fascists such as Vladimir

Zhirinovsky.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#33:1> The United States' own economic problems obviously aren't nearly

that serious or dramatic, but the Clinton administration and the Federal

Reserve Board have been engaged in an American version of the " shock

therapy" debate: One group of economists insists that the federal government

must continue to emphasize deficit reduction and inflation control, even at

the risk of slowing the economy and abandoning much of the president 's

original domestic agenda.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#34:1> Others insist that the president 's proposed investment in public

works projects and other pro-growth spending programs, already delayed for a

year, should now go forward.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#35:1> Administration officials said last week that their 1995 budget

proposal would, when adjusted for inflation, leave total domestic spending

below the levels established by the Bush administration.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#36:1> Those numbers still could change.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#37:1> If that proposal remains intact, though, it would constitute a

stunning retreat from the president 's original promise of new investment in

public works programs, education, job training and other basic domestic

needs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#38:1> If the president still feels the need to prove the seriousness of

his commitment to deficit-reduction, this budget proposal should satisfy any

remaining doubters.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#39:1> However, the deficit for the current fiscal year is now projected to

come in well below the administration 's original target.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#40:1> In the meantime, millions of Americans suffer the growing

consequences of social problems the federal government failed to address

throughout the 1980s.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#41:1> It 's not just our roads and bridges that are decaying.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#42:1> The foundations of many of our schools, neighborhoods and communities

are collapsing, too.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#43:1> The challenge for the Clinton administration and Congress is to

find the appropriate balance between maintaining a long-term commitment to

deficit reduction and responding to the immediate crises that only the

federal government can address.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#44:1> In fairness to President Clinton, his ( and the country 's) options

are severely limited as a result of the huge deficits accumulated by his

predecessors.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#45:1> The country simply cannot afford to adopt even the relatively modest

domestic agenda the president originally proposed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#46:1> At the same time, though, the country cannot afford to continue

to ignore crises in health care, education, the environment, criminal justice

and other domestic issues that have been all but neglected.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#47:1> As Russia 's disturbing experience reminds us, people eventually

become alienated - and susceptible to the easy answers of demagogues - when

their government seems unable or unwilling to meet its most basic

responsibilities to them.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#48:1> <h> Get Rostenkowski case over with</h> The allegations of misconduct

in office against U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., keep mounting, with no

end of the official investigation in sight.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#49:1> Meanwhile, at least eight Democrats have declared their intention to

run against him in the 1994 House primary, some in a genuine effort to beat

him, others to act as spoilers to help him win re-election.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#50:1> Yet with all the distractions, Rostenkowski continues to be an

effective legislator.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#51:1> He helped the Clinton administration pass its budget and NAFTA this

year, and he is certain to be a major player when health care takes center

stage next year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#52:1> The federal investigation of the powerful chairman of the House

Ways and means Committee began last May.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#53:1> It has covered a variety of allegations: that Rostenkowski cashed in

stamps from his congressional office and pocketed the money; that he used tax

money for cars and a phantom office in his Chicago district; and now, that

tenants of buildings owned by his family, full-time Chicago city employees

and former congressional employees were receiving payments from

Rostenkowski 's congressional office without any evidence they did any work

for the money.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#54:1> The newest reports come from interviews by the Chicago Sun-Times.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#55:1> Among the allegations are that Rostenkowski kept a Chicago alderman 's

wife on his payroll for five years after she resigned to have children; that

his congressional office paid two elderly tenants in a building his family

owned, although they did no work; and that a woman who used to work in one

congressional office told a grand jury she had never seen a man who

purportedly worked with her and collected

&dollar; 48,000 on Rostenkowski 's payroll over a four-year period.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#56:1> It 's difficult to understand why, after eight months of

investigation, the Justice Department hasn't acted on any of the evidence

amassed in these allegations, assuming action is warranted.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#57:1> There 's a cynical inclination to assume the Democratic Justice

Department is deliberately going slowly to preserve for as long as possible

Rostenkowski 's ability to help push President Clinton 's agenda through

Congress.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#58:1> But there 's also a question of fairness.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#59:1> Reports on allegations against Rostenkowski have been trickling out

almost as long as the investigation has been going on.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#60:1> Even grand jury witnesses are talking to newspapers.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#61:1> It isn't supposed to happen this way, and even if Rostenkowski is

guilty of everything he is alleged to have done, simple fairness says, get it

over with.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#62:1> Indict him or clear him.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#63:1> This has gone on long enough.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#64:1> Letting people twist in the wind got old 20 years ago.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#65:1> <h> Adm. Inman 's unsettling past</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#66:1> President Clinton 's selection of Bobby Ray Inman to succeed

Secretary of Defense Les Aspin sent much of official Washington into throes

of ecstasy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#67:1> Inman, a retired admiral and veteran of a variety of intelligence

agencies, is the consummate insider 's insider, a man so entrenched in the

ways of the federal city he has spawned his own generation of spinoffs,

proteges he trained who now serve in high government positions of their

own.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#68:1> While Washington insiders applaud, there 's a lot about Bobby Ray

Inman Washington outsiders might find unsettling.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#69:1> The matter of not paying Social Security tax for a housekeeper is

the least of what 's troubling about Inman.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#70:1> Until that issue began bumping Clinton nominees off their tracks,

nobody gave it much thought.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#71:1> What 's worth noting, however, is the lameness of the White House

excuse that Inman didn't make things right with the IRS until he knew he

would get the Defense nomination because he thought the tax rules might

change to exempt cases like his.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#72:1> Far more troubling is Inman 's work history since leaving the

federal government in 1982 after overseeing the most expensive intelligence

buildup in U.S. history.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#73:1> He embarked immediately on a career as a magnate of the civilian

defense industry - a position meant to trade on his Washington contacts.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#74:1> Inman 's private career could be described, charitably, as a

flamboyant failure.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#75:1> He presided over a leveraged buyout that led a Fortune 500

defense contractor straight into bankruptcy.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#76:1> He served as chairman and chief executive of that company, Tracor,

Inc., of Austin, Texas.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#77:1> He also was recruited as chairman of Westmark Systems Inc., an

investment group.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#78:1> Westmark bought Tracor for

&dollar; 714-million - 23 times the company 's earnings, an excessive price by any

reckoning - a month before the stock market crash of 1987.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#79:1> The junk bonds that financed the deal became virtually worthless, and

two years later - the year Inman was paid

&dollar; 1-million in salary, compensation and bonuses - Tracor filed for Chapter 11

protection.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#80:1> Inman also founded a consortium of computer software and hardware

manufacturers with the idea they would pool their efforts to compete against

Japan.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#81:1> The trouble was, he couldn't get IBM and AT&T to participate, and

without them, the grand plan had no hope of success.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#82:1> One Washingtonian who knows Inman well describes him as a man

adept at spending money but nearly dysfunctional when it comes to raising it,

saving it or managing it to cut costs.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#83:1> That 's a disquieting assessment of the man expected to oversee a

budget belt-tightening at the Pentagon dictated by the deficit and changing

international politics.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#84:1> At the same time, Inman has a lot of friends and supporters in

Washington who vouch for his management skills and probity.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#85:1> Many of these people are members of Congress and journalists to whom

Inman has ingratiated himself over the years.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#86:1> That 's not a constituency normally associated with military and

intelligence types, but Inman has courted them well.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#87:1> Their collective sense that Inman is a good and decent man can't

be dismissed out-of-hand, any more than their judgment that he has the

baseline experience for the Pentagon job.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#88:1> And Inman sounded refreshingly independent when he announced, with

Clinton standing at his side, that he voted for President Bush last year.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#89:1> But it bordered on arrogance when Inman went on to say that he

hadn't accepted this nomination until he talked to Clinton and reached " a

level of comfort" that the president was suitable to be commander in chief,

almost as though he were interviewing Clinton for employment instead of the

other way around.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#90:1> Perhaps that 's a residue of the years Inman was a boss.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#91:1> But at this stage of his career, it bespeaks the attitude of a man

too convinced of the correctness of his opinions, too entrenched in his own

personal ethic.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#92:1> Given recent disclosures of Inman 's willingness to trade on his

government service for very large personal gain, and given the ineptitude of

that effort, arrogance is a scary ingredient in the mix.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2E-006#93:1> Let 's hope he learned something from his failures in the private

sector.
<ICE-USA:W2E-006#94:1> Just as important, let 's hope the Senate will assure the American

people of that before sending this manipulator of the military-industrial

complex off to manage it.</p> </I>
