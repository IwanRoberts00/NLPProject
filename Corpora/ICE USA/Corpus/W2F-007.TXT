<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#3:1> The dirty, dystopian future of cyberpunk writers is so popular

now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#4:1> But if the future ends up looking more like " Leave it to Beaver" than "

Neuromancer", should we consider ourselves lucky or cursed? </p> <O> line</O>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#5:1> " Next!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#6:1> Jeez.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#7:1> Finally.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#8:1> As I enter the white room alone, three short, uniformed men display

practiced grins, gleaming straight teeth framed by dark, oily skin.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#9:1> My luggage has preceded me, and lies apparently unopened on the

plastic table - - the only furniture.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#10:1> Two video cameras glare ostentatiously from the eaves like Poe 's

ravens. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#11:1> " Anything to declare?"<ICE-USA:W2F-007#>One agent opens my suitcase and deftly

upends the contents on the table.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#12:1> The next employs a metal detector like a kitchen tool, stirring my

egg white socks and flipping my sausages.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#13:1> A similar metal detector was needed to eliminate the threat of the

brass rivets on my 501 's when I wasn't able to pass the walk-thru test a

second time. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#14:1> " Are you taking any prescription medications?"<ICE-USA:W2F-007#>Another agent

devours my overnight bag, snorting my talc, drinking my shampoo, chewing my

aspirin, and gnawing my hairbrush.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#15:1> Finally, sniffing my Speed Stick and giving my shaving cream Indian

rug burn in an attempt to unscrew either end, he turns his attention to his

clipboard. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#16:1> " Please turn your pockets inside out.?<ICE-USA:W2F-007#>The third agent seems

especially interested in my pens, taking them apart and flexing the springs

suspiciously.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#17:1> I find nothing at all in my pockets, having already emptied them

before the metal detector and EPD scan, and having vacuumed them carefully

before this trip. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#18:1> EPD ( Emotional Photograph Detectography) is an emerging science

wherein a selection of emotional elementals, the basic components of all

emotions, are measured.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#19:1> Some of the more elusive emotional components exist for mere

nanoseconds, and can only be detected using EPD.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#20:1> The resulting measurements are then interpreted as a concrete report

of the subject 's psychic personality.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#21:1> For example, violent criminals should show exaggerated hatred and

pain elementals, while the ideal, bovine citizen displays a healthy mix of

happiness, sadness, and fear. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#22:1> The EPD scan had encouraged me with its accurate reading of my

normally cool emotional complexion.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#23:1> EPD, despised in the West but employed in Newtopia, leaves much to be

desired in a psychic evaluator for one simple reason: criminals are commonly

more together than straight folk.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#24:1> But I had needed the recommendation - - my long hair is a serious

warning sign to these people.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#25:1> This fact is duly noted on several pages of my passport in large red

letters: " S.H.I.T." ( Suspected Hippie In Transit.) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#26:1> Notice the way my hands shake when I tell you this.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#27:1> A typically heavy storm thrashes the hotel windows rhythmically with

its wrinkled fingers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#28:1> I'm on th 'm60th floor of this 72-floor steel and glass monster,

slowly getting sick from the motion - - the hotel is a giant pine branch

stuck in the old tar of a derelict rolling gas station.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#29:1> My makeshift pendulum, a pencil suspended from the lamp by a

complimentary piece of thread, nervously etches a widening oval on hotel

stationery.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#30:1> Huge, horizontal claws of lightening, no longer shy to be seen by my

bloodshot eyes, scratch the paint off my retinas, leaving the white of true

power etched into my vision. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#31:1> I'm jet-l 'm wired.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#32:1> My watch delivers its one-liner with a straight face, " Sixteen

thirty-three." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#33:1> " Stop, you're ki 'ren' me!" I chuckle rhythmically, like a

woodpecker finding lunch.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#34:1> My gaze turns to the bathroom and I stop giggling abruptly. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#35:1> A flash of lightening lasts mere nanoseconds, but this one turns

from white to yellow as it lights up the shower curtain like a Las Vegas

night.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#36:1> I whip around, jaw snapping into place a bit late, and gape.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#37:1> I've se 'veplenty of esses blow in the past, but this one flares into

a screaming white magnesium celebration of the universe and my small brain.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#38:1> Hallelujah! The red neon tubes explode, exhaling their precious cargo

like an ejaculation.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#39:1> Tiny bits of burning sign dive off toward the street below in a

shower of sparks like space flotsam entering the atmosphere.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#40:1> The skin on my chest tingles with electricity. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#41:1> The storm is eerily over and the building rests, perhaps

sleeping, exhausted from its dance in the primal rain. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#42:1> " Sixteen thirty-two?"<ICE-USA:W2F-007#>I check my watch again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#43:1> Then my stomach checks in with me, hunger overpowering my nausea.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#44:1> I find the thought of a food-finding mission risky, but room service

is downright inhospitable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#45:1> " 'Adventure' is my middle name," I say as I grab my card key and

sunglasses. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#46:1> Outside the hotel, the hot, thick air presses against my face

like a wet blanket.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#47:1> The jungle doesn't stop at the city limits like a timid forest

creature, but spills out of cement troughs throughout the city.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#48:1> Youths on motor scooters choke the streets, buzzing from mall to mall

with their T-shirts on backward.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#49:1> Police adorn every corner, shouting nonsense over cellular phones,

9mm handguns and black batons painfully visible.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#50:1> Three million people slap the sidewalk with floppy sandals - - a

percussive symphony in the heavy air. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#51:1> A stocky blond man emerges backwards from a doorway in an office

building.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#52:1> His soiled cotton slacks and sweat-stained shirt distinguish him from

the throng as much as his fair complexion and relative stature.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#53:1> The stubble on this rube 's cheeks is days old.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#54:1> An irate woman, a madam with white pancake and rouge, follows him out

onto the sidewalk, ranting incoherently.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#55:1> A tan micro-van screeches to a halt in the middle of the street,

pig-tail radio antennae wagging, halting traffic in both directions.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#56:1> The front and back doors pop open and steady streams of small,

uniformed men pour impossibly from the tiny vehicle, like circus clowns.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#57:1> A captain, adorned with gold buttons and megaphone, becomes

ringmaster of this grotesque circus, as the acrobatic constables perform

fearless feats of brutality, quickly subduing the golden-maned lion.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#58:1> More cops rush needlessly to the scene from adjacent corners,

knuckles white on their batons. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#59:1> " Bad foreigner! Get in van!" shouts the ringmaster.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#60:1> " Everything OK now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#61:1> Nothing to look at.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#62:1> Everybody scram!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#63:1> " Baby crocodile crawled out of the sewer yesterday, damned if it

didn't bite my landlady!" says a nonplussed pedestrian, continuing his broken

stride. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#64:1> " Don't say.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#65:1> Good things come in small packages.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#66:1> Remember that guy with 93 outstanding parking tickets?
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#67:1> Just got nipped for 36 grand and three visits!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#68:1> " Ouch, ouch!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#69:1> " Smile when you say that." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#70:1> Newtopia employs corporal punishment to achieve its rigid social

order.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#71:1> Miscreants and nogoodniks are dealt with swiftly and effectively

according to a graduated scale of evil-doing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#72:1> Jaywalking, spitting, and littering bring a quick five hundred dollar

fine, as does the use of a public toilet without flushing afterwards.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#73:1> More serious crimes are punished by fining and beating the guilty

individual.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#74:1> Tampering with a telephone on the subway, peeing in an elevator, and

bad-mouthing a police officer all result in a fine and a beating.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#75:1> Counterfeiting results in a

&dollar;10,000 fine and five beatings. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#76:1> A beating is an organized affair, in which an appointment is made

for the sentenced offender to appear at an office, rather like a visit to the

dentist.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#77:1> Appointments are rarely missed, due to the ten- fold nature of

escalating punishments.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#78:1> Paperwork is required to officiate the event, " Please sign here and

here in triplicate...and here..."<ICE-USA:W2F-007#>Awaiting the soon-to-be-reformed criminal

are two police officers and a government doctor in an examination room,

completely bare of furniture except for a small stainless steel table on

which sits a clipboard and a medical bag.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#79:1> The penitent citizen is checked for sobriety, directed to strip down

to his/her underwear, and advised to assume a stance of attention in the

center of the room. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#80:1> The two officers proceed to administer the beating, which I will

describe sparingly, using no scathing adjectives or graphic similies. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#81:1> Using weathered bamboo canes three feet long, both officers

brutally deliver slicing blows from far overhead, like lumberjacks chopping

wood.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#82:1> The hapless recipient generally falls quickly to the linoleum floor,

but the beating continues relentlessly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#83:1> The two officers trade blows like Chinese slaves building an American

railroad.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#84:1> Each blow raises a discoloring welt or breaks the skin, and crimson

tears flow from the shallow wounds.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#85:1> The antidoctor, assigned to prevent death from excessive abuse,

determines the merciful end of the beating when the victim is suitably

reprimanded.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#86:1> After a few minutes, most citizens walk out under their own power.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#87:1> If the criminal has been sentenced to more than one beating, an

interval of time is prescribed between beatings for the wounds to heal.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#88:1> Some persons convicted of multiple crimes are suffered to endure the

lesser punishments, i.e.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#89:1> beatings, before the ultimate penalty, namely, hanging to death.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#90:1> Smugglers, pushers, and users are all sentenced to death, as are all

perpetrators of violent crimes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#91:1> Participants in shootouts with police are never tried - - anyone

stupid enough to point a gun at a cop is immediately shot to death. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#92:1> Allow me to state the obvious: cops in Newtopia engender no small

amount of respect.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#93:1> All males are required to serve a two-year term in the service of

their country when they are 18.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#94:1> It 's no wonder most elect to become police officers.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#95:1> What comes around, goes around. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#96:1> Subversive behavior is not tolerated.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#97:1> Dissenting opinion and left- wing blasphemy are not tolerated.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#98:1> Anyone caught voicing such revolutionary rhetoric disappears.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#99:1> " The Government is all-powerful, my son, and Thou Shalt Not Mess Wid

It." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#100:1> All news of any kind, that is, newspapers and TV news, is

carefully censored by the state.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#101:1> Editorials do not exist.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#102:1> Late-night TV stations run the following spots: A figure in

silhouette is shown standing, noose around neck.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#103:1> Next to the figure is displayed a name and a crime.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#104:1> Trapdoor opens, figure falls against taut rope, struggles for a

moment, then swings silently. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#105:1> McDonald 's sprouts everywhere like a shit-eating fungus.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#106:1> The thought of a Big Mac turns my guts, but the food park in the

broad alley attracts me like a dump attracts seagulls - - a pungent smell on

the air miles away.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#107:1> Ramshackle shops offer steamed rice, noodles, and a variety of

animal parts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#108:1> The flat eyes of whole, dead fish flick towards me in my peripheral

vision, but stay put when I stare at them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#109:1> I order noodles and fish by pointing and begin to eat. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#110:1> The sounds of commerce break apart like someone singing through

the blades of a moving fan.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#111:1> Thin yellow and orange spots blinking little neon lamps.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#112:1> Throbbing stroboscopic flash scene.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#113:1> My camera works at twelve frames per second.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#114:1> Now, only four frames every second.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#115:1> Step forward.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#116:1> Flash.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#117:1> Fumble bowl.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#118:1> Flash.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#119:1> Bowl crashes to street, chopsticks chasing madly after.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#120:1> Flash.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#121:1> Next step forward lands on noodles.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#122:1> Flash.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#123:1> I'm 'mmehow happy to be earthward bound as my feet then my legs

become egg noodle. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#124:1> Three Russians with five cars full of TVs, radios, VCRs, furs,

blank tapes, and pornography search docks for a homeward-bound ferry for

hire. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#125:1> I wake up in a hotel room with a bad hangover and a pulsing ache

in my side.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#126:1> I discover a wound there carefully sewn with black thread - -

twenty-three stitches.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#127:1> Here 's the routine: hooker snares white- faced John dupe, fucks him

in prearranged hotel room.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#128:1> Antidoctor joins femme fatale after John gets all squashed on dope

from doctored booze.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#129:1> Antidoc, he remove excess baggage from Johnny 's inventory.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#130:1> Kidney and pancreas sell well on black market.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#131:1> Antidoc, he patch John Boy up nice: " Get yer hands offa me!
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#132:1> I' 'ma wholesaler, not a murderer!" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#133:1> A smooth, circular pool set in the center of the room stirs

restlessly under my gaze.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#134:1> Glass water on top protects gossamer cloud below.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#135:1> Iridescent cream color cloud swirls when disturbed, flipping clear

opals flashing green orange red blue sparks.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#136:1> Swells and ripples of opal chips cascade away from droplets of sweat

falling off my nose. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#137:1> The opals fall crystalline, tinkling, echoing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#138:1> More sounds come from every corner.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#139:1> My mother calls my name clearly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#140:1> A trumpet plays a raceway overture.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#141:1> Bells and whistles are interrupted by a radio news report.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#142:1> " Thirty-one degrees at twenty-three twenty.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#143:1> Humidity a low 97.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#144:1> Rainfall totals two-point-seven centimeters..." All these sounds

from my memory coming clearly, yet projected on an auditory movie screen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#145:1> I summon more sounds by name - - earthen blocks thudding together,

rusty old roller skate wheels spinning, clips from a million unrecorded

symphonies composed in my head.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#146:1> Each sound is as clear and unprocessed as spring water, and on tap

for instant playback in this auditory theater. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#147:1> " I 'll be damned if it doesn't look like a free-flowing parking

garage," Zan confides. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#148:1> Allow me to describe this amazing structure.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#149:1> Each level undulates like a sine wave, exactly one cycle from east

to west extremes of the building.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#150:1> A second wave, exactly out of phase with the other, sits adjacent to

the first, so that the two waves share a common point exactly in the center

of the entire structure.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#151:1> By traversing from one wave to the next via one of the

aforementioned nodes, the intrepid parking garage spelunker can achieve the

uppermost bounds of this Sinusoidal Time Antenna ( STA). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-007#152:1> Each wave segment is frozen in time - - anchored in the stream,

if you will.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#153:1> Time is frozen, and we move freely through it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#154:1> An artificial light source provides the illumination here.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#155:1> Photons cannot travel in the STA, so imaginary light is used.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#156:1> Each quadrant of each wave bears an identifying scheme of colors,

applied to the white enamel supports.
<ICE-USA:W2F-007#157:1> You cannot get lost; out is always down, and up is always out. </p>
