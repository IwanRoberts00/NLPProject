<ICE-USA:W1B-018#1:1> <h> UMass Boston 1995-1996</h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#2:1> <h> The Chancellor 's Annual Report </h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#3:1> <h> A Message from the Chancellor </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#4:1> The year 1994-95 began for UMass Boston with resounding good news.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#5:1> The Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England

Association of Schools and Colleges gave us four commendations in continuing

our accreditation for the next ten years.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#6:1> We were commended for successfully pursuing the goals of our last

strategic plan despite a major economic downturn and in particular, for

instituting new graduate programs that further our urban mission.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#7:1> But the Commission also commended us for our commitment to

undergraduate students, for maintaining a " culture of teaching" with

programs aimed at improving and developing pedagogy, and for infusing the

student support functions of our Office of Student Affairs throughout campus

life.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#8:1> Finally, we were praised for the widespread participation of faculty,

staff, and students in the accreditation process itself, which in many ways

focused campus energy during the previous two-and-a-half years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#9:1> Members of our community take these commendations not only as a

vote of confidence, but also as something else: a sign for us that one phase,

the middle phase, of UMass Boston 's history has ended, and that a new one has

begun: our maturity as an educational institution.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#10:1> During 1995-96, we did come out of our accreditation process with a

renewed zest in our ongoing activities of teaching and learning, research and

scholarship.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#11:1> That zest is reflected again and again in these pages.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#12:1> But much of our campus energy during the past year was also focused

on charting a course for a new phase of our institutional history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#13:1> Much of this report is devoted to our plans for this new phase.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#14:1> It begins with the completion of our Strategic Plan for the next five

years, continues through the drafting of principles for transforming

undergraduate education across the campus, and moves into planning for the

construction of a long-awaited Campus Center--and the first capital campaign

in our thirty-year history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#15:1> But this movement into our future is not just planning; it 's also

doing.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#16:1> Important as it is, the Campus Center is part of a larger effort of

renovation and construction.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#17:1> During the past year we were able to move our Department of Public

Safety from the basement of the Healey Library to bright, highly visible new

quarters tucked under the Quinn Administration Building on our plaza.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#18:1> And in the library space freed by the move, we have created a

Learning Center--a physical setting for faculty and staff to acquire new

skills for the twenty-first century.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#19:1> We moved as well into a permanent process of academic program

review.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#20:1> We conducted our first review, enabling us to shift resources into

needs defined by our new strategic plan.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#21:1> We then assessed and revised these standards in preparation for a

review three years from now.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#22:1> At the same time, members of our faculty and administrative staff set

guidelines for assessment in every phase of our campus life.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#23:1> And, with the appointment of <@> Hamsah Arinio</@> as my special

assistant for urban affairs, we have begun a re-examination of our " urban

mission" itself, something which, despite clear successes, we do not take for

granted.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#24:1> This, then, is a report about a year of accomplishment by

students, faculty, and staff, but also about passing a milestone and reaching

far beyond it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#25:1> I send it to you with pride in our effort, and with my best wishes.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#26:1> <h> Transforming Undergraduate Education</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#27:1> For the past three years, committees of faculty and staff

representing the breadth of the university have sought to define excellences

in teaching and curriculum that would enable UMass Boston to help its

students meet the evolving challenges of the next century.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#28:1> In June, the Faculty Council accepted a set of recommendations of its

General Education Steering Committee to shape a new university-wide general

education curriculum.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#29:1> The Committee recommended assessment of the outcomes of learning,

the adoption of new ways to gain and improve intellectual skills, adaptation

to rapidly-changing demands of the workplace, and campus-wide faculty

collaboration in the development and testing of new pedagogies.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#30:1> It portrayed an educational life in which students were members of "

learning communities," working closely with other students and faculty in

intimate groupings of courses and other experiences.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#31:1> It described a learning experience which helped students become

self-conscious learners adept in thinking, communication, and research,

taking multiple perspectives on issues--and understanding the impact of their

studies on the life of metropolitan Boston.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#32:1> The Faculty Council then charged thirty members of our faculty

and staff to work throughout the summer to bring the implementation of a new

general education curriculum for UMass Boston nearer to completion.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#33:1> They formed working groups focused on four aspects of general

education: a developmental model with organizing principles for a

four-year-program; the students' first-year experience; science education;

and world languages and culture.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#34:1> By summer 's end, the groups were to report on pros and cons,

alternative approaches, and issues particular to their areas of concern. </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#35:1> <h> Examining Boundaries, Making Connections</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#36:1> UMass Boston 's transformation of undergraduate education will

call forth widespread, daily collaboration among faculty across boundaries of

colleges and disciplines.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#37:1> That type of examination of boundaries and making of new connections

began as well in other areas of UMass Boston 's academic program during

1995-96.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#38:1> UMass Boston 's ninth doctoral program, a Ph.D. program in nursing

to be conducted in collaboration with UMass Lowell, was given final approval

by the Higher Education Coordinating Council in November.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#39:1> Its students, the first of whom began their studies in fall 1996, can

draw on special strengths in nursing and health care policy on the Boston

campus, and nursing and health promotion in Lowell.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#40:1> The new doctoral program crosses boundaries on the Boston campus in

another respect: it will draw on courses and faculty in our doctoral programs

in gerontology and public policy and our master 's programs in business

administration, counselor training, and human services.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#41:1> UMass Boston 's varied approaches to international studies,

including its programs in European studies, East Asian studies and

international relations, were brought together as a Division of Global

Studies.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#42:1> Similar structures that bring together shared interests across the

traditional boundaries of colleges and departments were begun for two aspects

of education: foreign language instruction and the training of undergraduate

students as teachers.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#43:1> <h> A Process for Renewal</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#44:1> UMass Boston 's faculty and staff know full well that the

financial costs of providing undergraduate students with excellent

campus-wide general education will be great: they established nine doctoral

programs during the most difficult moments for the Massachusetts economy in

UMass Boston 's history.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#45:1> In the process of establishing those programs, they conducted two

major reviews of their allocation of resources.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#46:1> In 1995-96, they made the Academic Program Review a permanent process

on a three-year cycle, guaranteeing that scarce resources can be shifted to

meet emerging needs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#47:1> A committee of senior faculty, deans, and staff examined each of

fifty-five academic programs with a set of criteria that touched upon every

aspect of their activity, from teaching to public service.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#48:1> After careful review and consultation, it recommended that seventeen

programs either be eliminated or have their resources reduced; thirteen have

their resources increased; and twenty-five remain constant.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#49:1> The committee concluded its work by establishing criteria for a

review to follow in three years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#50:1> The Academic Program Review was the most visible aspect of an

effort to engage UMass Boston in careful assessment in every aspect of its

functioning.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#51:1> UMass Boston was one of twenty-six American colleges or universities

that had been chosen to participate in the American Council on Education-W.W.

Kellogg Foundation Program in Institutional Transformation.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#52:1> In 1995-96, a steering committee of faculty and staff drafted a

master plan to bring campus-wide assessment into reality.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#53:1> At the same time, the Boston campus participated in the UMass

system 's administrative redesign initiative--bringing state-of-the-art

management expertise to developing cost-saving measures in such areas as

purchasing, and new efficiencies in areas such as the administration of

student financial aid.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#54:1>
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#55:1> <h> The l995-1996 Budget </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#56:1> UMass Boston 's 1995-96 operating budget was

&dollar;125,319,357. <ICE-USA:W1B-018#57:1> This represents a modest 3.3% increase ove&percent; 1994-95,

primarily in grants and contracts, fundraising activity, and state financial

aid.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#58:1> State support for the campus rose by

&dollar;1.4 million, or 2.4 %, to
&percent;
&dollar;61.8 million; but state support now represents only 49.2 &percent; of total

operating funds.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#59:1> We continued our policy of minimizing student charge increases by

only modestly raising fees, which now represent 15&percent; of our revenue.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#60:1> As we examine our current fiscal situation and project future growth,

we believe it is realistic to forecast that state funds will remain less than

50&percent; of the total.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#61:1> Our future financial stability and capacity to develop new programs

will come largely from our success in increasing non-state funding and

enrollment.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#62:1> During 1995-96 we also continued to assess expenditures carefully

through the academic program review and administrative redesign processes.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#63:1> Several recommendations for reallocation of existing resources to

critical activities were formulated and carried out.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#64:1> We admitted the first students to our M.A. Program in Dispute

Resolution, our Ph.D. Program in Computer Science, and the Urban School

Leadership Track of our Ed.D. Program; and, through a major networking

project, we provided ethernet access to every desktop and student lab. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#65:1> We were delighted that funding for much-needed deferred

maintenance, as well as for Campus Center construction, rose dramatically in

1995-96.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#66:1> We now expect to complete many repair projects over the next three

years and to move forward with the Campus Center, which will open its doors

as early as the year 2000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#67:1> UMass Boston 's fiscal situation has stabilized.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#68:1> With careful planning, wise investment of existing resources, and

active solicitation of new funds, we are confident that we can reach the

goals we have set for ourselves.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#69:1> <h> The Challenge of Maturity</h></p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#70:1> The year 1995-96, the thirty-first in our history, was special in

many ways--for the successes of our students and the teachers that guided

them, for breakthroughs in research, and for the affirmation of our role in

metropolitan Boston.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#71:1> It was a year in which we committed ourselves to self-assessment,

establishing new connections--and looked into our future.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#72:1> In one sense we are still a very young institution.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#73:1> We still count among us members of our first faculty and staff.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#74:1> They remember well what it took to constitute an entirely new faculty

and deliberate on an institution 's identity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#75:1> Many more of us understand a middle phase of an institution 's

existence: to chart a new direction as we did during the 1980 's in graduate

education, and turn an institution 's resources toward that direction, even in

the most difficult budgetary climate in our history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#76:1> In 1995-96, I feel, UMass Boston began a new phase.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#77:1> We made the review of our programs a permanent process, and put it on

a regular cycle.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#78:1> We began the re-examination of functions we knew were

excellent--undergraduate teaching, the pursuit of our urban mi,ssion--to

assure their excellence in a rapidly changing future.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#79:1> We affirmed the loyalty of our alumni and friends, and appealed to

that loyalty to help build our future by planning our first capital campaign.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#80:1> These are functions of a mature institution.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#81:1> In 1995-96, UMass Boston took up the challenge of its maturity.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#82:1> In 1995-96, I feel, UMass Boston began a new phase.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#83:1> We made the review of our programs a permanent process, and put it on

a regular cycle.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#84:1> We began the re-examination of functions we knew were

excellent--undergraduate teaching, the pursuit of our urban mission--to

assure their excellence in a rapidly changing future.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#85:1> We affirmed the loyalty of our alumni and friends, and appealed to

that loyalty to help build our future by planning our first capital campaign.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-018#86:1> These are functions of a mature institution.
<ICE-USA:W1B-018#87:1> In 1995-96, UMass Boston took up the challenge of its maturity. </p>
