<ICE-USA:W2A-001#1:1> <h> IDEOLOGY AND GENRE IN THE BRITISH ANTIREVOLUTIONARY DRAMA OF THE

1790s</h>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#2:1> <h> By Jeffrey N. Cox</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#3:1> The first category, represented by such works as Dent 's <it>

Bastille </it> ( Royal Circus, 1789), John St. John 's <it> Island of St.

Marguerite </it> ( Drury Lane, 1789), and Charles Bonnor 's <it> Picture of

Paris in the Year 1790 </it> ( Covent Garden, 1790), offered London

theater-goers an opportunity to cheer the actions of the people of Paris as

they liberated the Bastille in Dent 's play or freed the Man in the Iron Mask

in St. John 's.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#4:1> These plays celebrate mass action and trace a movement from the

enclosed spaces of the past-the prison, the castle, the convent-to the open

spaces of a liberated future, a movement that marks them as parallel to the

revolutionary festivals analyzed by Mona Ozouf.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#5:1> In fact, many of these plays themselves end in festivals, not only of

public liberation but also of romantic union, an erotic liberation that is

seen to arise with political liberty.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#6:1> This turn to the erotic is even clearer in the other potentially

radical dramatic form of the day, the Gothic.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#7:1> The Gothic drama may have its roots in such plays as Horace

Walpole 's <it> Mysterious Mother </it> of 1768, but it did not become a major

force on the British stage until after 1789, the year of both the Bastille

and the publication of Ann Radcliffe 's first novel.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#8:1> I have argued elsewhere that the Gothic was read at the time as an

ideologically charged form, a reading revealed powerfully in Coleridge 's <it>

Biographia </it> where he defines the Gothic as the <quote> " modern

jacobinical drama."</quote>6
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#9:1> For present purposes, it is important to note that the Gothic, when it

traces the liberation of its lovers from past restrictions imposed by cruel

fathers, lascivious lords, and fanatic monks moves to the rhythms of the

revolutionary spectacular; and when it instead emphasizes the erotic quest of

the villain-hero as he pursues pleasure in defiance of any limits, the Gothic

portrays a more individual rebellion.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#10:1> The Gothic was seen as embracing either individual or collective

revolt, and its celebration of erotic liberation was particularly troubling

to the defenders of official morality and culture.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#11:1> J. C. Cross 's <it> Julia of Louvain; or, Monkish Cruelty </it> ,

taken we are told <quote> " from a paragraph in a Newspaper during the French

Revolution"</quote> ( 99) and staged at the Royal Circus in 1797, offers a

kind of compendium of these features of the prorevolutionary drama.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#12:1> It engages both the historical spectacle - drawing upon an actual

event and seeming to invoke the patters of revolutionary festival - and the

Gothic.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#13:1> It tells the story of Julia, loved by Clifford but also sought by the

noble St. Pierre.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#14:1> When she rejects the libidinous aristrocrat, he has her imprisoned in

a loathsome convent.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#15:1> The play climaxes when a crowd, led by officers of the Revolution,

storms the convent and Clifford liberates Julia from her dungeon.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#16:1> Arising to counter such plays, the antirevolutionary drama also

faced what Ronald Paulson defines as the central problem of all artistic

attempts to represent the Revolution.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#17:1> Since the Revolution was seen as an unprecedented event - even Burke

called it <quote> " the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the

world"</quote> - the use of traditional forms and images to present it would

misrepresent its uniqueness.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#18:1> What genre does one use for an event that is sui generis? How is one

to stage a conservative version of the radically new events of the

revolution?
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#19:1> The <it> Anti-Jacobin </it> , in introducing its poetry section,

makes, albeit humorously, an astonishing suggestion - that poetry itself in a

revolutionary age might become revolutionary, that there might be no genre

for the conservative poet to adopt: <X> <quote> " But whether it be that good

Morals, or what we should call good Politics, are inconsistent with the

spirit of true poetry-whether <it> 'the Muses still with freedom found' </it>

have an aversion to <it> regular </it> Governments...We have not been able to

find one good and true Poet, of sound principles and sober practice."9 Of

course, as the poetry of the <it> Anti-Jacobin </it> itself demonstrates,

conservatives did write. </quote> <X>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X20:1> One response to this situation, and the one adopted by the <it>

Anti-Jacobin </it> itself, is to turn to parody, to attempt to undo or revise

the forms adopted by one 's opponents.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X21:1> It is significant that the greatest antirevolutionary art of the

period is created by the caricaturists and that the antirevolutionary dramas

which found some stage success tended to be satires on Jacobins.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X22:1> Another course was to react against the new forms arising within the

British theaters of the 1790s and to return to traditional tragedy,

particularly neoclassical tragedy, as a declaration in formal terms that the

Revolution was not new and that history finally spoke of noble individuals

and not popular action.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#X23:1> We can discover the two key targets of the conservative drama 's

revisionary tactics in a satire that appeared in the <it> Anti-Jacobin </it>

during June 1798.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X24:1> This weekly was founded by a group of Pitt 's supporters around

George Canning, made undersecretary of foreign affairs in 1796; it included

John Hookham Frere, whose adaptation of octava rima would late inspire Byron,

George Ellis, who had earlier proved himself a satirist for the Whigs, and,

as editor, William Gifford, who was brought in, Canning 's biographer tell us,

because he could provide a <quote> " thoroughly brutal spirit." </quote> 10
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X25:1> Whether or not the journal had financial support from the

government, it had the political support of a series of Tory aristocrats, and

it is rumored that Pitt himself contributed to the journal 's parodies,

including its great satire on Jacobin drama entitled <it> The Rovers; or The

Double Arrangement </it> .</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#X26:1> The play attacks what it calls the German school of drama-what

Coleridge later, perhaps recalling this piece, relabels the <quote> " modern

jacobinical drama ( which, and not the German drama, is its appropriate

designation)." </quote> 11
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X27:1> This school is seen as comprising on the one hand the Gothic and on

the other hand the plays literary history identifies as the drama of the <it>

Sturm und Drang </it> , plays which are seen by the <it> Anti-Jacobin </it>

as immoral filth preaching <quote> " the reciprocal duties of one or more

Husbands to one or more Wives"(236). </quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X28:1> What, the play 's authors object to are British dramas that imitate

foreign models in order to bring to the stage, first, acts of successful mob

violence against the authority of the church and nobility and, second, an

ideology of sexual liberation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#X29:1> The Gothic drama is satirized in the story of one Rogero, who

has been imprisoned in an abbey by his father for loving a woman beneath his

station.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X30:1> His dungeon provides an opportunity to recite a litany of Gothic

clichés: <X> <quote> SCENE changes to Subterranean Vault in the Abbey of

QUEDLINBURGH; with Coffins, 'Scutcheons, Death 's Heads and

Cross-bones.-Toads, and other loathsome Reptiles are seen traversing the

obscurer parts of the Stage.-ROGERO appears, in chains, in a Suit of rusty

Armour, with his beard grown, and a Cap of grotesque form upon his

head.-Beside him a Crock, or Pitcher, supposed to contain his daily allowance

of sustenance.-A long silence, during which the wind is heard to whistle

through the Caverns.(238)</quote></X>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#X31:1> Rogero is liberated from this dungeon in the final scene by a

mob action that mimics the Gothic <it> Julia of Louvain </it> or <it> The

Island of St. Marguerite </it> or, for that matter, Dent 's <it> Bastille

</it> ; and the play ends with the figures of traditional authority, the

prior and Rogero 's father, the count, being led off in chains.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X32:1> The action of the liberators is undercut, however, as their band-led

by a man thought a waiter but revealed to be <quote> " No Waiter, but a <it>

Knight Templar </it> " </quote> ( 245)-is unable to defeat a body of <quote> "

Choristers and Lay-brothers"</quote> until Puddingfield and Beefington, two

British barons in exile awaiting the signing of the <it> Magna Carta </it> ,

call for a battering ram and a Roman legion appears to complete the

assault.12
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X33:1> This single scene parodies many central images and ideas of the

Jacobins-the appeal to Roman precedent, the admiration for Saxon liberty, not

to mention the belief in action by the people.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X34:1> The dramatic image of the people liberating castles and convents is

here ridiculed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X35:1> Clearly only a nobleman, even if he is an exiled nobleman, or a

Roman general, even if he is caught in a time warp, could complete such

heroic action; no waiter-not even one who is also a Knight Templar-could ever

change history.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#X36:1> The other object of the satire-the popularity of such German

plays as Schiller 's <it> Robbers </it> and <it> Cabal and Love </it> ,

Kotzebue 's <it> Stranger </it> , and Goethe 's <it> Stella </it> - is

announced in the prologue: <X> <quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X37:1> To-night our Bard, who scorns pedantic rules, His Plot has borrow'd
 'drom the GERMAN Schools; - The GERMAN Schools - where no dull maxims bind The

bold expansion of th'electric mind. Fix'd to 'do period, circled by no space,

He leaps the flaming bounds of time and place.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X38:1> Round the dark confines of the Forest raves, With gentle ROBBERS

stocks his gloomy caves; Tells how bad MINISTERS are shocking things, How

reigning Dukes are just like tyrant Kings; How to two Swains one Nymph her

vows may give, And how two Damsels with one Lover live! ( 237)</quote></X>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#X39:1> This passage makes an important link between political

resistance to authority and the embrace of sexual freedom.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X40:1> This connection is at the heart of the <it> Anti-Jacobin 's </it>

vision, as is made clear in its prospectus, where it identifies its enemy as

<quote> " JACOBINISM in all its shapes, and in all its degrees, political and

moral, public and private, whether as it openly threatens the subversion of

States, or gradually saps the foundations of domestic happiness." </quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X41:1> In the view of Mr. Higgins, the fictitious Jacobin author of <it>

The Rovers </it> , the German drama calls for a new </quote> " SYSTEM

comprehending not Politics only, and Religion, but Morals and Manners, and

generally whatever goes to the composition or holding together of Human

Society; in all of which a total change and Revolution is absolutely

necessary"(236). </quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X42:1> Within the play, this attack upon domestic happiness is traced

through the relations of Matilda, Rogero 's love and mother of his children,

who has also borne children by Casimere who is married to Cecilia; the cast

list includes the children of Matilda by Casimere, the children of Matilda by

Rogero, the children of Casimere and Cecilia along with <quote> " Several

Children; Fathers and Mothers unknown"(237). </quote>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X43:1> Political revolution be abhorrent, but it is the prospect of sexual

liberation-particularly the liberation of female sexuality-that is truly

terrifying.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-001#X44:1> The position adopted by the <it> Anti-Jacobin </it> was neatly

summed up by William Cobbett in a poetic epistle to its editor, Gifford,

about his satire the <it> Baviad </it> .
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X45:1> Cobbett joins Gilford in attacking playwrights who have <quote> "

their gothic hands on social quiet laid, / And as they rave, unmindful of the

storm, / Call lust refinement, anarchy reform." </quote> 13
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X46:1> This double assault upon popular rebellion and sexual liberation

defines the project of the antirevolutionary drama.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X47:1> This project, both ideological and generic, seeks to defeat the

dangerous erotic power unleashed in both the Gothic and in revolutionary

romances through an appeal to domesticity and patriarchal power in formal

terms, there is an attempt to transform the Gothic into the domestic

melodrama.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X48:1> And there is also a struggle to replace the image of mass action

with conspiracy theories of isolated, ambitious men manipulating the foolish

people-in formal terms, the conversion of revolutionary spectaculars such as

Dent 's <it> Bastille </it> into neoclassical tragedies of intrigue.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X49:1> <h> II</h>

<p> The attack upon the French Revolution as the site of sexual excess was

established early, in, for example, Burke 's <it> Reflections on the

Revolution in France </it> , as Paulson among others has pointed out.14
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X50:1> Burke first works to establish the French royal family as a model of

domestic love and loyalty.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X51:1> Louis XVI, who had difficulty consummating his marriage, hardly made

an ideal model for patriarchal potency, but Burke transforms him into an

image of manly and kingly prowess.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#X52:1> In the figure of Louis confronting the mob at Versailles Burke

offers us a perfect father, husband, and ruler: <X> <quote> " As a man, it

became him to feel for his wife and his children, and the faithful guards of

his person, that were massacred in cold blood about him; as a prince, it

became him to feel for the strange and frightful transformation of his

civilized subjects, and to be more grieved for them, than solicitous for

himself"(488). </quote> </X>
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#53:1> Marie Antoinette was, if anything, a harder case, known for her

flirtatiousness and revealing dress and attacked as an adulteress, lesbian,

child abuser, and even incestuous lover.
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#54:1> Burke 's famous passage on the queen-rising to his complaint <quote> "

But the age of chivalry is gone"</quote>-describes her as not only possessing

beauty, <quote> " glittering like a morning star, full of life, and splendor,

and joy," </quote> but also as embodying <quote> " lofty sentiments"</quote>

and the <quote> " dignity of a Roman matron"</quote> ( 488-89).
<ICE-USA:W2A-001#55:1> She thus manages to combine physical charm with the iron-clad

domestic virtue of the Roman wife and mother.</p> </I>
