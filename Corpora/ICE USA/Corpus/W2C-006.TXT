<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#1:1> Donald Zuidmulder likes to set a quick pace, whether he 's striding

through Brown County Courthouse hallways or traveling as a tourist.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#2:1> Just ask his wife.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#3:1> " He 's not a good tour-group person," said Gloria Zuidmulder, who

goes by the name of Snooky.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#4:1> " He 's got lots of energy.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#5:1> He'll take one day 'llcover places it takes most people four

days."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#6:1> The Brown County judge - - who regularly begins his day working

out at the YMCA - - recently returned from a solo bike trip along the Baltic

coast.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#7:1> The 2 1/2 week trip - - with a stop in Paris for Bastille Day - -

was a way for Zuidmulder to combine his passion for history and physical

fitness.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#8:1> " I've always been fascina 've by the Hanseatic League and cities

along the Baltic.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#9:1> And cycling was the best way to see it," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#10:1> The league was a confederation of north German cities that began

to develop in the late 1100s.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#11:1> Zuidmulder, 58, arrived in Amsterdam on June 30.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#12:1> He bought a bicycle and rode it from Lubeck to Flensburg in Germany.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#13:1> Then he took a ferry to Denmark and cycled 110 miles in one day.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#14:1> Another ferry took him to Rostock, Germany.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#15:1> In all, he pedaled 400 miles.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#16:1> " I was very worried," said Snooky Zuidmulder.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#17:1> " But I tried to be supportive.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#18:1> I knew he could handle it."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#19:1> " He stayed on my good side by phoning home every day."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#20:1> The judge filled a pocket notebook with lists of people and

places he encountered.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#21:1> He carried eight new

&dollar;1 gold coins and gave them out to folks as a way of thanks.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#22:1> Among the recipients he noted were two high school girls he met

on a train.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#23:1> They translated for him with a railroad conductor.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#24:1> Some German police officers escorted Zuidmulder to the right

biking path after they saw him go astray.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#25:1> " People are the same all over.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#26:1> If you're open with them, 'reu'll find out how 'llerous they are," he

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#27:1> In Paris, Zuidmulder joined the throngs of thousands who watched

the French Foreign Legion parade down the Champs Elysees on Bastille Day,

July 14.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#28:1> Bastille Day marks the anniversary of the storming of the

Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, setting off the French Revolution, which

ended the monarchy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#29:1> More than 200 years later, the spirit of liberty prevailed on

Bastille Day.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#30:1> People shared wine and cheese with one another, Zuidmulder said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#31:1> A woman played an accordion as songbooks were passed out to

revelers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#32:1> " I don't speak French, so I just hummed along with the others.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#33:1> It felt great," Zuidmulder said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#34:1> He also visited Notre Dame Cathedral and toured the Louvre.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#35:1> Zuidmulder was overwhelmed by the Louvre 's famous art treasures

by the Dutch masters, Michelangelo and the Leonardo da Vinci.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#36:1> The 40-acre Louvre has eight miles of galleries and houses more than

1 million works of art.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#37:1> " It was a cultural overload," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#38:1> Looking back on his adventure, Zuidmulder was happy about his

feat.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#39:1> He saw Europe through a different spectrum.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#40:1> He also liked the solo trip because he could just " let it

happen."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#41:1> The judge has lived most of his life in Green Bay except for

seven years he spent in college in Madison.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#42:1> He graduated from law school in 1968 and was elected Brown County

district attorney in 1970.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#43:1> He was in private practice from 1975 to 1997, when he was elected

Brown County judge.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#44:1> " There was no schedule.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#45:1> I set my own pace.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#46:1> I made sure I called home every night," he said.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-006#47:2> <h> De Pere residents may have to pipe down or face the music</h>
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#48:2> <h> Fines of up to

&dollar;1,000 in effect in quiet zones </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#49:2> DE PERE - - Waking up the neighbors in De Pere could cost you up

to

&dollar;1,000 if you raise a ruckus in a designated quiet zone.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#50:2> The City Council Tuesday unanimously approved an ordinance

allowing residents to petition the city to create neighborhood quiet

zones.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#51:2> In quiet zones people would pipe down between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.

or risk a fine of up to

&dollar;1,000, City Administrator Kevin Brunner said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#52:2> The idea for quiet zones was born of meetings with residents in

the St. Norbert College neighborhood.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#53:2> People said they are bothered by noisy students, many of whom

rent houses there.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#54:2> " Jaybirds and magpies are what they sound like," Larry Roffers

of Pleasant Place said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#55:2> " They sit out on the porches ...
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#56:2> and make noise until two or three in the morning."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#57:2> Once the city receives a petition for a quiet zone, a public

hearing must be held before the area is designated, Brunner said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#58:2> In other council matters, city officials said Tuesday that no

laws were broken by allowing use of two properties in a residential area as a

parking lot before the area was rezoned.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#59:2> The City Council on Tuesday approved 7-1 the rezoning of

properties at 318 Fourth St. and 404 College Ave. from Single and Two-Family

Residence District to Central Business District.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#60:2> The properties had been used as a 35-space parking lot for about

a month by the Nicolet Commons development on Reid Street, said Bill Patzke,

the city 's planning director.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#61:2> Houses on the properties were torn down several months ago, he

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#62:2> Robert Zittlow, who lives on a Reid Street, accused the city of

acting illegally by tearing down the houses and creating a parking lot before

rezoning the area.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#63:2> But Brunner and Patzke said the city acted in line with the

laws.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#64:2> Patzke said property does not have to be rezoned before

demolishing a building on it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#65:2> Brunner said that a development agreement with Nicolet Commons,

LLC that the council approved in December allowed a parking lot on the

properties before they were rezoned.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#66:2> Alderman Paul Kegel voted against the rezoning, suggesting that

city laws should take precedence over agreements with private developers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#67:2> " If we have policies and procedures but don't follow them,

aren't we being illegal?" Kegel asked.</p> </I>

<ICE-USA:W2C-006#68:3> <H> Golf: Lopez 's availability remains iffy for Great Lakes

Classic</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#69:3> GURNEE, Ill.-- LPGA Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez remains uncertain

that she'll be able to 'llay in next month 's ShopKo Great Lakes Classic at

Green Bay Country Club in Bellevue.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#70:3> Lopez said Tuesday that she hasn't resolved child-care problems

that would prevent her from playing in the inaugural event on the Women 's

Senior Golf Tour.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#71:3> " I really do want to play in Green Bay," Lopez said before a

practice round for the U.S. Women 's Open at The Merit Club.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#72:3> " I'm going to try a 'm work things out, but I'm still not sure 'm</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#73:3> The Great Lakes Classic, which will be Aug. 16-20, is already

missing Hall of Fame members Pat Bradley, Beth Daniel and Betsy King.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#74:3> If Lopez - - who is officially committed to play - - withdraws,

it would leave the tournament without the marquee player among LPGA members

age 43 and older.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#75:3> " I really think we're going t 'ree there," said Lopez 's caddie,

Lane Kjeldsen, who was at Green Bay Country Club last week to work on a

yardage book of the course that players and caddies will use during the

tournament.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#76:3> " I think that it 's a good sign that her caddie was up here,"

Great Lakes Classic spokesman Mark Kanz said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#77:3> Lopez learned earlier this month that her longtime nanny had

given notice that she planned to take another job.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#78:3> Lopez and her husband, former major league baseball player Ray

Knight, have three daughters.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#79:3> The search for a replacement nanny will intensify early next

month.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#80:3> After this week 's Open, Lopez will play the LPGA stop in Warren,

Ohio, and then return home to Albany, Ga., to interview potential nanny

candidates.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#81:3> " I really haven't had time to interview anyone because I've been
 'velaying so much," Lopez said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#82:3> " Hopefully, I can find someone that I'm comfortab 'm with because I

really want to play in Green Bay.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#83:3> It would certainly be a thrill to win the first ( WSGT)

tournament."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#84:3> Time is running short for Lopez to hire a new nanny in time for

the Great Lakes Classic.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#85:3> The

&dollar;500,000 tournament begins four weeks from today.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#86:3> " Unless we get definite comfirmation otherwise, we're expe 'reng

her here," Kanz said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#87:3> " I think the Lopez name gives instant credibility to the event, but

that 's not to say it wouldn't be credible without her."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#88:3> Kanz said support for the tournament has gained momentum as the

date nears.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#89:3> Volunteers and tournament workers were here at the Women 's Open

handing out Great Lakes Classic pamphlets to fans as they entered The Merit

Club.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#90:3> " We've got 've a very warm reception," Kanz said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#91:3> " So we're ve 'reexcited about how things are going."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#92:3> <h> What 's next </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#93:3> The Lambeau Field stadium board is tentatively scheduled to meet

at 7 p.m. Monday to consider setting Sept. 12 as the referendum date on the

0.5 percent stadium sales tax.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#94:3> The Packers moved closer to a Sept. 12 referendum on a stadium

renovation sales tax with the Green Bay City Council 's vote Tuesday to pass a

naming-rights and maintenance agreement.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#95:3> The council 's 8-4 vote to approve the agreement with the Green

Bay Packers followed more than 11/2 hours of heated debate.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#96:3> " This was a crucial step," said John Jones, Packers senior vice

president of administration, after watching the vote.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#97:3> " It was required under the law.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#98:3> We made many, many significant concessions to reach this point."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#99:3> The vote paves the way for the Lambeau Field stadium board - -

created by the Legislature this spring - - to set the referendum date on a

0.5 percent sales tax in Brown County.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#100:3> The tax would help fund a

&dollar;295 million stadium renovation.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#101:4> <h> Supporters see tax relief </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#102:4> Supporters of the agreement said they liked the fact that it

guarantees the city a 50-50 split of potential naming-rights revenues and

commits the Packers to selling naming rights if a deal worth at least

&dollar;120 million is obtained.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#103:4> " Three weeks ago we had zero dollars ( from naming rights),"

Alderman Daniel Haefs said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#104:4> " When I met with the Packers they were very adamant that this was

not going to be on the table.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#105:4> But it 's my conclusion that renaming Lambeau Field is going to get

done whether we are going to do it with the Packers or they were going to do

it themselves."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#106:4> The city 's proceeds could be used to help pay off the stadium

project debt more quickly, Haefs said.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#107:4> <h> Opponents wanted more </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#108:4> Opponents said they were wary of whether naming rights would

ever be sold because they anticipate the Packers would launch a campaign not

to sell naming rights.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#109:4> <h> How they voted </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#110:4> The Green Bay City Council voted 8-4 in favor of a naming-rights

and maintenance agreement for a renovated Lambeau Field.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#111:4> Aldermen voting yes: Ron Antonneau, Eugene Schmitz, Darlene

Marcelle, Anthony Theisen, Daniel Haefs, Jane Hansen, Tim Hinkfuss, Kathy

Johnson.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#112:4> Aldermen voting no: Gary Kriescher, Beth Zeise, Guy Zima, Linda

Queoff.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#113:4> Alderman Guy Zima led the charge on the council floor to reject

the agreement and seek a better one, even if that meant postponing a vote on

the stadium sales tax until February.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#114:4> Zima argued the council shouldn't be satisfied with a 50-50

split on naming rights.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#115:4> " You really may have done your best, but your best isn't good

enough as far as I'm 'moncerned," Zima told Mayor Paul Jadin, who represented

the city in negotiations with the Packers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#116:4> " The Packers should commit to using their naming rights revenues to

pay down the debt."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#117:4> But Alderman Eugene Schmitz scoffed at Zima 's proposal that the

city should be entitled to all of the naming-rights revenues.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#118:4> " I don't think that this council would get 50 cents if we named it

ourselves.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#119:4> Who would buy it from us? We 've got nothing to sell.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#120:4> We need the Packers on our side."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#121:4> Alderman Gary Kriescher said he doesn't think the Packers will

live up to the agreement.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#122:4> He said he was upset that the deal didn't provide the city more than

50 percent of naming rights revenue.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#123:4> <h> Other objections </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#124:4> Even those who spoke in favor of it said they weren't happy with

all aspects of the plan.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#125:4> Council President Kathy Johnson said she hoped she was

representing the interests of her far-west-side constituents by voting

yes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#126:4> " I don't think what we have is a perfect situation, but we

don't live in a perfect world," she said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#127:4> Two of the votes against the agreement came from new members of

the council, Linda Queoff and Beth Zeise.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#128:4> " I 'm a huge Packer fan and I want this to go to the voters, but

I am not persuaded that this agreement is in the best interests of the city

of Green Bay," Queoff said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#129:4> She questioned the lack of an arbitration clause in case the

Packers and city reach a point where they are at odds over interpreting the

language in the pact.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#130:4> Zeise raised questions about whether the Packers would support

informing taxpayers about the potential savings of a naming rights deal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#131:4> Zima agreed, predicting the team would be " fanning the flames

of tradition" in a bid to retain the name.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-006#132:4> Jadin disagreed.
<ICE-USA:W2C-006#133:4> " Are you telling me the Green Bay Packers don't want

&dollar;60 million? We want it for taxpayers, and the Packers want it for player

salaries."</p> </I>
