<ICE-USA:W2F-014#1:1> <h> " Getting Better"</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#2:1> <h> Al Divver</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#3:1> Instead of decently dying, or at least disappearing into my

adoptive metaphor, I took to wandering all over the North Shore.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#4:1> Sometimes I'd walk for hours 'dn Peabody.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#5:1> On these walks I imagined myself trying to find signs of real life.p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#6:1> Occasionally I'd stop and look 'dry hard at the little box homes

in my neighborhood, as though they contained some mystery to be explored, but

one day, as I was examining a little pink house on a street of identical

little pink houses, three cop cars pulled up.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#7:1> Before I could say a word, the drivers jumped out and rousted me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#8:1> I tried to explain that I was only trying to find signs of life, but

they handcuffed me and brought me to the station.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#9:1> Camella, of course, rescued me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#10:1> She told them, in so many words, that I was pazz', but harmless.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#11:1> As I was sitting on the reception area bench, waiting for my release,

I heard the desk sergeant say, " You'd better keep th 'd bird in a cage, lady.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#12:1> He 's scaring the tax payers around here.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#13:1> After that unpleasant incident, I began to borrow the Cadillac, which

was unregistered.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#14:1> I supposed that if I were stopped by the police I could plead

innocent on the grounds of invincible pazziness, but, remarkably, those

vigilant, fancy-town cops never spotted me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#15:1> Day after day I would drive over to Manchester by the Sea, or

Magnolia, or Ipswich, and laze on the beaches all day.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#16:1> I think the absorption of my mind into the mindless meeting of sky,

sand and water did me some good.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#17:1> The regular rhythm of ocean waves pounding on the rocky shores had a

powerful narcotic effect on me as I lay inert on the sand .
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#18:1> Strangely, I almost never fell asleep.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#19:1> With my eyes six inches above sea level I watched sandpipers hopping

around looking for food and gulls screaming their desires as they battled for

scraps.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#20:1> Occasionally, a least tern would materialize before me in one of its

swoops to the water.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#21:1> Cormorants appeared and disappeared on the swells. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#22:1> Memory, desire, despair; all of them gave way to a rhythm that

seemed to me an endless repetition of the same, both meaningless and

reassuring. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#23:1> There were plenty of young women on those beaches, but I had no

interest.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#24:1> On days when I did not relish being narcotized, I would sit on the

sand and watch the surf for hours, convinced that it had a message for me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#25:1> None came.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#26:1> After a few months, neither ecstasy nor self-hypnosis any longer

satisfied me, so I bought running shoes and ran on every shore road I could

find.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#27:1> In the golden autumn afternoons, I especially loved to be framed by

the blue ocean on one side, with its honored guests, the flocks of migrating

birds, and the riotous red, orange and yellow of the trees, as they began to

lose their summer inhabitants, on the other.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#28:1> Running in the midst of this glory made me feel like a mellow fellow,

but it didn't give me the message I was seeking.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#29:1> The trees, the birds, the ocean, all spoke, it seemed to me, but

their message was general and untranslatable into the language of

introspection.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#30:1> Almost every day I would go into the little eateries in Manchester or

some other coastal town, drink coffee, and chat with the people working

behind the counters.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#31:1> These were rich towns, but the rich were always elsewhere, it seemed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#32:1> The coffee shops and breakfast places were largely populated by

elderly people, who had lived long lives in these towns years before the

yuppy boom, lived as vassals to the old money in the magnificent houses along

the coast, or as fishermen for whom the sea meant something other than it did

to the owners of the many yachts moored in the harbor, or to me, for that

matter, as I dozed on the regenerative beaches.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#33:1> I especially liked Fowle 's, a funky place in Newburyport, where the

old men of the town hung out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#34:1> One side of Fowle 's was devoted to everyday items like magazines,

newspapers, cigars and supplies, the variety and number of which rivaled

anything in Cambridge.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#35:1> The middle of the large, long space was lined with booths, which made

a sort of room divider.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#36:1> On the other side ran a long lunch and breakfast counter with pole

mounted stools.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#37:1> I got in the habit of having breakfast there, mostly so that I could

chat with the old men.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#38:1> It seemed to me that these old codgers knew a secret that I did not.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#39:1> They talked a lot about baseball and the weather and other concerns

of the day, of course, but they were also a treasure-hoard of information

about the town and its past.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#40:1> They talked about their wives, their children, their grandchildren,

even their great grandchildren.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#41:1> They had stories about their families several generations back.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#42:1> They remembered Plum Island before it got crowded, and the town

itself before it underwent gentrification.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#43:1> They told me stories about friends who had drowned, spectacular sea

rescues, disasters, triumphs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#44:1> They described the harbor of sixty and more years ago.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#45:1> They remembered all the eccentric characters on both land and sea.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#46:1> Some even remembered how they met their wives.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#47:1> A few cried unashamedly at the memory of lost loved ones.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#48:1> Most of them were lonely, and had little more than their memories to

comfort them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#49:1> Even though, at their age, memory usually meant recollections of

loss, they made of it a kind of presence, reassurance that they belonged

somewhere in the world.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#50:1> Whatever their stories, they all carried on uncomplaining. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#51:1> I made a good friend of one denizen of Fowle 's, or, more

accurately, he adopted me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#52:1> His name was Sam Amaro.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#53:1> Sam had owned a fishing boat for a while and had fished the local

waters for more than fifty years before a heart problem and a bad back forced

him into retirement.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#54:1> He had lost his parents to influenza after the Great War, when he was

ten years old, and his brother eight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#55:1> Much of his childhood had been spent in orphanages and foster homes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#56:1> One of his foster parents happened to be a fisherman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#57:1> When Sam was fourteen, the fisherman took him out on an expedition.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#58:1> From that time on, Sam was a fisherman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#59:1> He remained close to his brother all those years, even though they

spent most of that time in different foster homes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#60:1> When Sam turned eighteen, he applied for guardianship of his brother.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#61:1> In those days, before the rise of social workers, nobody much cared

to inquire into the details.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#62:1> If a relative signed for a child, the judge let him go.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#63:1> Sam told me that his joy at having his brother with him was like

nothing he had ever experienced, and since has been matched only by the birth

of his two children.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#64:1> When Sam married Maria Albiani, a Gloucester fisherman 's daughter, in

1931, - - he said that was joy, too, but of a different kind - - his brother

continued to live with him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#65:1> Apparently, they were very happy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#66:1> Sam and his brother, whose name was Antonio, like my father 's, worked

very hard to save money for a boat, a task made more difficult by the birth

of Sam 's son and daughter.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#67:1> Tony had decided, said Sam, to forsake looking for a wife until Sam 's

family was a little more financially secure, so he stayed resident in a tiny

room off the back hallway of the ramshackle apartment they had rented.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#68:1> In 1935, the brothers bought their dreamboat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#69:1> They christened it with an elaborate name: Santa Maria della Buona

Fortuna. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#70:1> A token of their desire to express, through Maria 's namesake,

their joy in the present and, in their evocation of the goddess, their hope

for the future.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#71:1> Life went along very smoothly for a few years.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#72:1> Tony had fallen in love, and, now that the brothers were solvent, had

decide to get married.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#73:1> Much to everyone 's satisfaction, he found a place to rent only a

block away.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#74:1> The wedding took place on the boat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#75:1> Then, one night in 1938, Tony, with a small crew, was returning from

an unusually long fishing trip.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#76:1> Sam had stayed in Gloucester to help tend his son, who had contracted

scarlet fever.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#77:1> About twelve hours from Gloucester , the hurricane hit the Santa

Maria della Buona Fortuna.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#78:1> The coastguard later reported that they had received a distress

signal from the vessel, but that the message had been cut off before they

could fix its position.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#79:1> The family barely survived that disaster, which crippled them both

economically and emotionally.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#80:1> Tony 's wife moved in with Sam and Maria.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#81:1> Both women took jobs in fish packing plants, Maria at night, Tony 's

wife during the day.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#82:1> They shared care of the children.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#83:1> Sam barely survived.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#84:1> Only the thought of his children, he told me, kept him afloat. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#85:1> Sam had to go back to working on another man 's boat.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#86:1> The pay was poor, because the smaller boats were losing out to the

big trawlers that came out of Boston.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#87:1> Somehow, and Sam, looking back on it, professes not to know how, the

three adults managed to feed and clothe the children, and send them to

school.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#88:1> Both children were good students and both won college scholarships.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#89:1> The daughter, Maria, went to Smith, where she studied literature.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#90:1> She now teaches at Berkeley.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#91:1> Tony, the son, went to Boston College.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#92:1> He was interested in the law.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#93:1> While there, he joined the R.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#94:1> O.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#95:1> T.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#96:1> C., to help defray costs that his scholarship didn't cover.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#97:1> In 1952 he graduated summa cum laude.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#98:1> Three months later, on a muddy hill half way across the world, a rain

of artillery shells exploded in the midst of his platoon, killing him and

most of the men he was leading.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#99:1> Oddly enough, according to Sam, he was not destroyed by the news.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#100:1> By that time he had learned to expect such things from life.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#101:1> When his wife died of cancer, in 1988, Sam did not cry.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#102:1> He had cried too much during the long months of her suffering, he

said.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#103:1> Now, he looked forward to the times when he could see his daughter

and her children, although he was not yet ready to move out to " cuckoo

land," as he put it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#104:1> He had too many memories along the streets and shores of

Massachusetts to give them up just yet.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#105:1> This was the man who befriended me at the counter of Fowle 's

everything store in Newburyport. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-014#106:1> Many days we would walk the beaches together.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#107:1> Sam never said much on these walks, except to comment on the clams,

or plants, or salt-water marshes, as we went along.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#108:1> He knew everything about them, it seemed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#109:1> Once, he took me clamming.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#110:1> He had borrowed a pair of hip boots from a friend for me, but they

were much too big.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#111:1> We hadn't sloshed out into the mud flats very far, when I got stuck.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#112:1> The green-black ooze caught hold of me and sucked me in high over my

knees.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#113:1> The more I struggled, the more I sank.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#114:1> Sam, standing safely away from the carnivorous mud, was enjoying the

spectacle mightily.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#115:1> Finally, after he had had enough entertainment, he threw me a line

from a boat beached nearby.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#116:1> I grabbed it and began pulling with all my strength.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#117:1> As I pulled, my too big boots remained in the muck, and, when my

feet finally got free of them, the force of my pulling twisted me around my

clamming pail and caused me to go sprawling face first in the stinking stuff

that formed the world 's most complex ecosystem.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#118:1> All around me, I could see jets of water sent up by indignant

bivalves.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#119:1> Sam, standing at some distance, called out to me, " That 's a way,

son.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#120:1> You shua found them clams.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#121:1> Now all you gotta do is dig ` em up.?
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#122:1> Once out of the boots, I managed to pull myself to safety.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#123:1> I was painted green black and smelled like low tide at the point

where salt water marsh meets the ocean.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#124:1> For those who have smelled that smell, no explanation is necessary;

for others, no description is adequate.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#125:1> Against the ribbing of the old boys at Fowle 's, I presented myself

as Swamp Thing, just off the set of the third sequel, " The Red Tide of Swamp

Thing." I guess I owed them a little entetainment in exchange for their

stories.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#126:1> I was happy to believe that sticking my nose into the tidal eddies

of the salt marsh shoreline showed me an angle on life I would otherwise

never have seen, or smelled, because I had reached the stage of looking at

all my experiences as lessons.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#127:1> Especially those taken at shore level.
<ICE-USA:W2F-014#128:1> </I>
