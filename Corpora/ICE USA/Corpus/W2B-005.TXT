<ICE-USA:W2B-005#118:1> through a glass brightly Stained glass isn't " stained" by coloring

agents at all.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#119:1> White light contains every color of the rainbow.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#120:1> To isolate co/ors, creating the stained effect, certain chemicals

are added to the molten sand that is glass in its liquid form.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#121:1> The chemicals separate the colors - filtering out each color except

that of the final piece of glass.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#122:1> Because the coloring process is done with chemicals instead of

pigments, stained glass does not fade, even' over centuries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#123:1> After the coloration process, the glasses blown into large

cylinders, then cut in haft lengthwise, re-liquified and cooled in sheets.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#124:1> Artists and studios use these sheets to create stained-glass

designs.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#125:1> When the subject for the window has been chosen, the artist makes a

design from which a pattern is made showing the exact shapes and sizes of the

pieces of glass to be cut.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#126:1> The glass is cut to fit, allowing spaces for leading between the

pieces.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#127:1> Details of the design, such as facial features, drapery and

ornamental motifs are then painted on with enamel mixed with ground glass and

a temporary glue.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#128:1> then fired in a kiln.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#129:1> This makes the glass opaque, creating shadowy details such as facial

features and drapes in fabric.
<ICE-USA:W2B-005#130:1> The artist fits lead around the pieces and solders the joints, then

waterproofs the work by applying putty solution beneath the leading.
