<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#1:1> My academic library is in the market for a new integrated library

system.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#2:1> As part of this process we've done all t 'veusual things, including

drawing up wish lists of desirable OPAC features and using them to evaluate

numerous systems.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#3:1> We've also taken 'veo far more interesting steps.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#4:1> First, we actually asked the faculty what they thought were important

features to have in an online catalog.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#5:1> ( This was suggested by a faculty member.)
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#6:1> Second, on three separate occasions we set up " demonstration

stations"--terminals in the library connected to two or more of the systems

under consideration--for hands-on use by faculty and students.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#7:1> Some of the systems were graphical, some character based.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#8:1> In some cases, we showed two versions of the same system.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#9:1> We provided comment sheets for signed or anonymous remarks, and staff

were available nearby to give help or take reactions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#10:1> We got a lot of input.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#11:1> The results probably won't be turned into a major motion picture

anytime soon, but they aren't without interest either.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#12:1> Here are several lessons I've drawn from 'veis experience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#13:1> And no, I'm not naming 'mmes; if you think you can identify a sinning

or virtuous system, keep it to yourself.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#14:1> <h> Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#15:1> Vendors take note: if the academic community were in charge of

selection, the race would go to the swiftest.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#16:1> The most frequently repeated positive comments recorded in six weeks

of demonstration stations were in praise of fast response times.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#17:1> The most frequent negative remarks concerned slow response times.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#18:1> Forget the bells and whistles, just grease the wheels.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#19:1> " Prefer keyboard to mouse."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#20:1> " Personally, I hate using a mouse and find it far more trouble than

it 's worth."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#21:1> There were numerous comments along these lines, including my

favorite: " I worry about old profs using the mouse."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#22:1> This leads me to several thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#23:1> First, it 's a mistake to assume that everyone knows how to use the

rodent or sees any virtue in becoming mouse-literate.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#24:1> We have DOS-based machines that won't be upgraded for years.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#25:1> We have hundreds of students doing everything from e-mail to serious

computation via command-line prompts on central UNIX clusters.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#26:1> We have old profs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#27:1> Second, mice are troublesome.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#28:1> They have a tendency to walk out the front door if not secured.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#29:1> They take up valuable counter space and work poorly on most surfaces.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#30:1> The obvious solution is to use keyboards with built-in trackballs for

in-library OPAC stations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#31:1> However, this aggravates the first problem: how many of us are handy

with a trackball?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#32:1> Third, it is a great step backwards to force patrons to switch

from keyboard to mouse with great regularity.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#33:1> A fact of life: you can't type a search string without the keyboard.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#34:1> Why should you be forced to also point-and-click to select an index,

to position the cursor for data entry, or to perform any other adjunct to our

most common of functions, the OPAC search?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#35:1> Here 's the moral of this story: a graphical interface should not

require a mouse.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#36:1> It should allow a mouse, and it should be designed to capitalize on

those areas where pointing, clicking, and dragging really are superior ways

of communicating human intentions to a small square box.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#37:1> But mouse commands should have keyboard equivalents, and basic acts

like entering a search should not require hand movement from the keyboard to

the mouse pad.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#38:1> <h> They Don't Do Windows </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#39:1> One might expect that patrons would prefer any graphical user

interface to a terminal-based or character interface, if for no other reason

than a GUI seems so much more modern.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#40:1> Not so in our experience.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#41:1> Of all the OPACs we demonstrated, two systems from two different

vendors received the largest number of positive responses; one was graphical

and the other character-based.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#42:1> What they had in common was the general feeling that they were " easy

to use."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#43:1> The general feeling about Microsoft Windows interfaces is that

they can be particularly difficult to use.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#44:1> Developers need to remember that human beings are not born with an

innate knowledge of Windows, and that Windows conventions are not intuitively

obvious to the uninitiated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#45:1> An interface that will go to great lengths to explain catalog-related

functions ( " Author search: enter words from author 's name") may assume that

patrons know how to use a scroll bar or close a window.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#46:1> Some GUIs let you move and minimize windows, not anticipating the

unhappy scenario when one patron minimizes the search window and the next

patron walks up to a totally unfamiliar screen.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#47:1> Developers should also remember that icons are memory aids for

functions that people are already aware of.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#48:1> They don't substitute for help, mnemonics, or textual explanations of

available functions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#49:1> If words like " search" or " next" can fit on a button, they are

likely to be more illuminating to the average patron than the picture of a

magnifying glass or a left arrow.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#50:1> Until we have a common command language for icons, let 's give the

user a break and assume that one word is worth a thousand pictures.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#51:1> <h> Strength of Character </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#52:1> As noted above, character-based interfaces were not universally

scorned.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#53:1> Nonetheless, our users were quick to differentiate the good from the

bad and the ugly.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#54:1> People liked not having to press the Enter key when selecting from

limited choices on a menu ( a feature possible in UNIX systems that 3270-type

transmission doesn't allow).
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#55:1> They liked long, clear prompts at the bottom of the screen, such as "

Show items with the same subject" and " Limit this search," even if it meant

that an " Other options" prompt was needed for additional choices that didn't

fit on one page.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#56:1> Users did not like having to move the cursor around the screen to

highlight and select menu options.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#57:1> They did not like more than one way of doing something or when it was

not clear how to do something ( e.g., type first letter of option or move

cursor to option and press enter).
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#58:1> They did like having all data entry on a single command line.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#59:1> Users did not like having to return to a search options menu by

requesting " new search" or " another search" in order to type a new search.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#60:1> They didn't see why they couldn't have a command line on each screen

from which they could enter searches.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#61:1> On the other hand, users didn't seem to mind having to go through

several layers of menus to do something special, like limit a search result

set, while library staff rebelled against those hierarchies.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#62:1> Patrons seemed more concerned that directions for out-of-the-ordinary

actions be clear than that they be quick or streamlined.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#63:1> <h> It 's All in a Name </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#64:1> Almost every system we evaluated had a feature to allow a user to

easily issue searches related to a given work.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#65:1> That is, once users found a relevant catalog record, the system let

them search the added entries, tracings, and/or call numbers from that record

without rekeying.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#66:1> In most systems, this option was called " related works" or

something of that sort, and selecting it would take patrons to a screen

listing authors, subjects, series, and call numbers.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#67:1> When the user chose a heading or call number, the system would

automatically perform the search.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#68:1> Nobody commented on this capability, positively or negatively, for

any of these systems.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#69:1> In one OPAC, an option was limited to call numbers and was called

" show items nearby on shelf."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#70:1> More than a dozen people commented.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#71:1> " Browsing what 's nearby on the shelf is a very convenient feature."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#72:1> " 'Show items nearby on shelf' speeds research and makes this choice

number 1."</p> <&> GRAPH, TABLE, FIGURE, ETC omitted from this section</&>
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#73:1> <h> Take It to the Limit </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#74:1> We sent a questionnaire to faculty and library staff asking them

to rate the importance of various OPAC features and tabulated the responses

of each group separately.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#75:1> The widest difference in opinion concerned the value of search limits

by language, location, and material type, and the value of call number

browsing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#76:1> Library staff rated all these features as highly desirable, while the

faculty weren't particularly interested.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#77:1> Search limits by material type ranked lowest of all the features we

inquired about.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#78:1> ( The ability to limit retrievals by date, on the other hand, was

widely desired.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#79:1> As a general rule, library staff rated almost all features closer

to the " very important" end of the scale than the faculty did.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#80:1> The single feature most important to faculty was network access,

followed closely by modem access.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#81:1> We have to face it: the faculty 's main goal is to stay away from the

library.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#82:1> One implication is that we won't be able to provide much personalized

instruction and on-the-spot assistance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#83:1> Perhaps it is no coincidence that the feature the faculty ranked

second highest was " adequate online help, both contextual and explicitly

requestable."</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#84:1> <h> Power to the Patron </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#85:1> Patrons want empowerment--all sorts of empowerment.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#86:1> They want to be able to designate any record or set of records and

download it, or print it, or e-mail it to themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#87:1> They want to issue holds and recalls for material that 's charged out

to others and renew materials charged out to themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#88:1> They want to view their own patron records, fine records, and loan

records.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#89:1> They want to be able to request that materials be delivered to them,

ordered for them, and put on reserve for them.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#90:1> They want to be able to make comments and suggestions to the

library.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#91:1> No negative comment was made about any patron empowerment

function, except perhaps that it was not comprehensive enough, or didn't

offer enough options.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#92:1> What do you mean I can't route this to my own network printer?</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#93:1> <h> That 's All Folks </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#94:1> Of course, we got a lot of other comments, many very useful, many

very specific to the OPACs under consideration.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#95:1> Often people expressed completely opposite opinions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#96:1> " I love Windows."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#97:1> " I hate Windows."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#98:1> " This system is great."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#99:1> " This system is awful."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#100:1> But behind almost all of the rants and the raves was the concept of

ease of use.
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#101:1> " I love Windows because it 's easy."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#102:1> " This system is awful because it 's hard."
<ICE-USA:W2A-039#103:1> And even though it 's true that to some extent ease of use is in the

eye of the beholder, it was clear that all OPACs are not created equal.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-039#104:1> Since I assume nobody actually sits down to work and says, "

Let 's make this catalog hard to use," maybe we should all spend more time

watching students and faculty at demonstration stations.</p>
