<ICE-USA:W1B-004#1:1> <h> Yaki, habibi, amigo, que ondas?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#2:1> I'm sick as the search for an attorney general ( pretty sick, 'm?),

but wide awake and listening to ridiculously romantic Chilean toonz on " my"

state-of-the-art stereo, in " my" apartment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#3:1> My beloved ( you gotta love English words with written accents) lies

sleeping peacefully beside me, but I'm still bug-eyed and thinking as fast as

[ insert anothe 'mbizarre governmental simile here].
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#4:1> [ There was a break in the time-space continuum there, in case you

didn't notice. I'm no longer listening to the Chilean music-- which,

inci 'mntally, was not Chilean but Cuban! - - Ed. Note] </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#5:1> If my throat weren't so infernally sore I'd do this letter on the

 'done, but unfortunately paper is the best medium for those who wish to play

mute.<ICE-USA:W1B-004#> Gross.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#6:1> My beloved ( shouldn't that be beloved?) is in REM phase but his right

eye isn't all the way shut.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#7:1> Just thought I'd share with you...</p>

 'd> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#8:1> I am, I believe, one step away from acquiring my very own gorgeous

apartment.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#9:1> Tomorrow I have to go meet the landlord.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#10:1> " If you don't have purple hair or leather beads," explained Realtor

Jim, " she'll probably accept you," which of 'llrse would have prompted me to

run out and buy a few boxes of RIT if I hadn't felt ready to crawl under my

covers and hibernate ( a reference to my cold, and not to landlord 's apparent

intolerance for avant-garde fashion).
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#11:1> So I'll go see her tomorrow in profess 'llal drag, hand her the money

for last month 's rent, impress the hell outta her and promptly revert to my

bizarre and slightly wild self when she hands me the keys.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#12:1> I'm excited.</p>

<p> The apt. is in Fields' Corner, 'mme part of Dorchester I work in.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#13:1> Unfortunately, moving closer to work means moving farther away from

my viaggiaphobic* friends, who probably will never visit me, but that 's

nothing new.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#14:1> I'll be closer to a bunch of Dorc 'llter politicos I've recently

fallen in with.
<ICE-USA 'veB-004#15:1> The biggest plus is, it 's mine!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#16:1> By myself ( with the frequent participation of my beloved, o'course)!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#17:1> No more house meetings!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#18:1> No more charts to figure out how many hours of cleaning, or repairs,

or yard work, or sidewalk sweeping, or cooking, I " owe" to the house!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#19:1> I guess I could make my own charts.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#20:1> A friend of mine told me about someone they know who, suffering group

house withdrawal, made herself a work chart when she arrived at her new

place.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#21:1> She made it in the form of a wheel, and when guests came over she'd

spin it for them, 'dsing, " Hmm, I wonder whose turn it is to take out the

trash?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#22:1> Oh!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#23:1> Whaddyaknow!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#24:1> It 's my turn!"
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#25:1> And so on.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#26:1> Silly wretch. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#27:1> The bizarre artwork below is a creation by none other than yours

truly, in case you had any doubts.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#28:1> The latest acquisition to my ever-increasing collection is the

strange woman-with-cord one.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#29:1> I shall now write on another piece of paper, leaving this one

temporarily blank.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#30:1> Do not fear.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#31:1> <h> *fear of travel, from viaggere & phobia</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#32:1> My beloved 's eyelid has returned to normal, I'm glad to

report.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-0 'm#33:1> What a bloody weird letter.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#34:1> Evidence of recent exposure to more British stuff ( Like The

Buddha of Suburbia.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#35:1> It turned out to be an intriguing book but a decidedly

realistic-and-thus-slightly-depressing one.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#36:1> One of those which ends the way the world will-- " not with a bang,"

etc. I still recommend it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#37:1> Especially cos you - - or at least I-- find yourself wanting to imbue

the protagonist with hero-like qualities, which are all shot to hell because

he 's pretty much a clueless bastard.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#38:1> It ignores the traditional and irritating expected roles of " good

guys" and " bad guys" that, to my dismay, one still finds in novels.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#39:1> Sigh. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#40:1> Another great book I read, this actually is a " Great Book" in

the Western scholar sense, was Pride & Prejudice - - I think I might've

mentioned that.
<ICE-USA:W1B 've4#41:1> I'm impressed 'cos I had to realize ( admit?) 'mat them classics

could actually Be worth reading.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#42:1> Except Ethan Frome and The Scarlet Letter still suck.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#43:1> Hey, wanna know another thing I'm looking forward to doing with

the new a 'm.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#44:1> ( Besides moving into it)?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#45:1> Creating, as much as possible, a new-plastics-free space.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#46:1> I don't want to buy any new plastic products if I can avoid it.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#47:1> That 's a little difficult just in terms of lack of availability of

bulk cleaning products, for example, but I'm determined.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#48:1> In fa 'm, I really want to buy used stuff as much as I can just on

principle ( besides being cost-effective).
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#49:1> I want to prove it 's possible to have a hot ap. without brand-new

yuppy furnishings from Conran 's or Crate & Barrel.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#50:1> One thing I've noticed already is that most 'vechen utensils sold in

the budget stores are shrink-wrapped.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#51:1> It 's so ludicrous!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#52:1> I can't see the advantage to it, except perhaps that having smaller

items attached to cardboard means you can hang them on a pegboard for easy

display. Still, they could do that and not shrink-wrap anything ( which would

only be a small improvement o'course).
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#53:1> Personally, I'm for selling them out of bins.
<ICE-U 'm:W1B-004#54:1> I bet it 's a shoplifting prevention attempt.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#55:1> Grrrr. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#56:1> Have you heard anything from Pam recently?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#57:1> The woman is the only one I know whose love life has as many

intriguing twists 'n' turns in it as mine.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#58:1> I miss her immensely.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#59:1> Some day before California becomes a submerged landmass, I shall move

to SF and join her.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#60:1> ( And you, if you're already there.) </p> 're<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#61:1> Did you and I ever have the " since I moved to the city my voice

has gotten tougher" conversazione?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#62:1> I can't recall but I suspect we did, once.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#63:1> If not, I suggest it as a future topic.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#64:1> Oh, Yon, mah mahn'd 's ( innovati 'd apostrophe 'd') a-whirl an 'dah

cain't sleep.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#65:1> I have so much of this pseudo-intellectual fake-ostentatiousness pent

up inside of me right now.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#66:1> I have to admit that SF was the one place where I felt I could swing

back into that very Oberlinian mode of conversation-- maybe because it was

the first time I'd been almost 'dclusively with white folks my age again?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#67:1> I want to seek that stuff out, but around here the folks our age seem

too fake to me - - too BU, too big hair.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#68:1> I'm sure it 's a question of enviro 'ment, knowing where to look, but

I'm frustrated.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004# 'm:1> Please send me your comments about the social scene ( yours, of

course) in N.Y.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#70:1> I will now make a concerted effort to at least sleep a few

hours.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#71:1> I didn't end up sleeping very much.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#72:1> I just got sicker and sicker, and less able to breathe as a result.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#73:1> So now it 's the next day, or I guess it 's night, and I napped so much

I'm wide awake again.
<ICE-USA: 'mB-004#74:1> Sigh... At least this excellent Gershwin piece is on WBUR!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#75:1> Right now I feel like I can't get enough culture.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#76:1> I want to open my jaws so far that they come off their hinges, and

swallow up as much art as I can!</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#77:1> On my sickbed are the following items: one roll of TP, stationery

collection, two stuffed animals ( a purple brontosaurus and a sickly

sweet-pink bear), one disgusting, overused handkerchief, information about a

material aid caravan going to El Salvador, two letters from you, three from

Brazil, and a couple others, yesterday 's Globe ( " US. Details 6-part plan to

end war in Bosnia"), my journal, four books: cotton candy on a rainy day ( N.

Giovanni 's poetry), Ratha & Thistle-Chaser ( silly sci-fi/fantasy),

All-Bright Court ( by Connie Porter), The Joy Luck Club ( Amy Tan), a sheet,

two blankets and a poncho, three pillows, me.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#78:1> Just thought y'd like t' 'dow!</#>

<p> And guess what else? - - I got MY OWN APARTMENT!!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#79:1> The interview w/landlord turned out to be a cinch, even though I

almost vomited on the train ride out there, I was so sick.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#80:1> More on dat in another letter!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#81:1> Love love love write soon bay-bee c ya </p>
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#82:1> <h> <@> Agitha</@></h>
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#83:1> <h> Yo,</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#84:1> You're probably th 'reing: What in the world??!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#85:1> This woman didn't actually forget me??!!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#86:1> Or maybe: What?! This woman still exists?!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#87:1> Well, it 's true, I haven't, and I do, and I feel compelled to say OF

COURSE after each of those.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#88:1> I got so incredibly sad about not getting to meet with you before you

left the continent ( ! ) that I wasn't at all rational; if I had given it

some serious thought, I suppose I could've managed to at 'vest call you

before you left Saskatchewan, but you know me, I'll die bef 'll I control my

emotions, and so the weeks passed and by now you're probably 'repily

ensconced in Sri Lankan life once again....
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#89:1> ( By the way, the run-on sentences are intentional.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#90:1> I try to write as I think these days. I understand that for

linguistic purists like some of us ( ahem, ahem) this may be a bit of a

DRAG!)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#91:1> So, anyway, it is now October, exactly one week before your

birthday.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#92:1> Odd, isn't it?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#93:1> Two years ago we were on our way to visit Nazeem in Amherst!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#94:1> That seems like it happened to someone else, not me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#95:1> In fact, I'm at the point where a 'm of Oberlin seems like that. The

experience is not so old to have faded from memory, but old enough to have

lost a realistic quality.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#96:1> Part of that stems from the unbelievable lack of communication

between myself and the hundreds of wonderful Obies
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#97:1> I know.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#98:1> Amazing how once you're not all l 'reng in the same pissant little

town, you find a million excuses for not writing or talking to each other.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#99:1> This has got to be The Saddest Thing that 's happened to me since I've

moved h 've, this trend of fabulous people falling out of my life.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#100:1> Since June of 1990, when I arrived in Boston, 15 ( that 's FIFTEEN)

friends or would-be friends of mine have left for greener pastures.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#101:1> Some went to New York, some to San Fran, some were so disillusioned

with the country that they left for Finland, or Italy, Taiwan via Bombay...

It 's been hard to stay optimistic in the wake of all these folks jumping

ship.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#102:1> I myself would go, too, except that ( a) I love my house, ( b) I

don't really have as much money as I'd lik 'dto yet, considering the type of

travelling I want to do, and, most importantly, ( c) I've been qu 'veioning

how important it is for me to go.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#103:1> With respect to the last one there, I've decided 'ver the time being

that I want to do some work here in my own country for a while, maybe even

travel here, and THEN go somewhere else.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#104:1> Maybe I'm just putting 'mff going 'Cos I'm chicken, 'co 'mI don't feel

strong enough yet.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#105:1> Maybe five years from now I'll sti 'llbe sitting here in the same

computer room ( we have no use for a dining room, but we have a computer

room!)-- who knows.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#106:1> At this brief moment in time it feels right to say that those are my

plans.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#107:1> ( Give me two hours and I'll pro 'llly have something different to

say.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#108:1> Whew, what a paragraph.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#109:1> I remember in grade school they used to teach us that a paragraph

was only three sentences long.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#110:1> Ha! </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#111:1> Did I tell you I'm teaching s 'mll?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#112:1> Last we talked I had gotten a month-long shot at teaching at Mujeres

Unidas, right?
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#113:1> Well, they asked me to stay and teach the intermediate class this

semester! I was thrilled, to say the least ( considering that if they hadn't

I'd've 'den 'veemployed).
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#114:1> Of course, teaching an entire semester has been twenty times harder

than teaching less than four weeks' worth, but it 's also been rewarding.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#115:1> For example, I can actually develop themes over a long period of

time, where in July we just sampled them.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#116:1> Thus, this summer we talked about housing issues; slang to use when

you're r 'rentically/sexually interested in someone; welfare; stereotyping of

Latinos; women and work; neighborhood safety, and a wealth of other short

topics.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#117:1> But this time around I've st 'vetured the class around forms of

discrimination.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#118:1> Each unit has focussed on a different type: mostly we've ta 'ved

about racism, but right now we're t 'reing about sexual harassment ( as the

events in this country 's Senate make it quite a propros).
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#119:1> It 's exciting to say that I can actually do this!
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#120:1> And the women that I teach are wonderful, so we've 'veen able to

create an atmosphere where they feel free to talk, and even I don't feel

embarassed to bring up my own race and discuss issues that might develop from

that ( " teacher = position of power" stereotypes).
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#121:1> I'm 'mrd-pressed to put into words all that this class means to me.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#122:1> It 's not just a useful early teaching experience or a new group of

friends.
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#123:1> It 's a myriad of opportunities for growth, and I can feel that

growth happening ( although it 's never fast enough! I get so impatient with

myself!).
<ICE-USA:W1B-004#124:1> Pretty exciting, eh?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1B-004#125:1> I 'm listening to a song that always makes me think of Juan

Santos, that guy who stole my heart shortly after I pieced what was left of

it back together after the Vik fiasco. </p> </I>
