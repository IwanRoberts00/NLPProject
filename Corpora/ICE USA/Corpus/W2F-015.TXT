<ICE-USA:W2F-015#1:1> <h> " Argyst"</h>
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#2:1> <h> Deborah Bryan</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#3:1> Despite the old saying, you may do well to look certain gift

horses in the mouth.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#4:1> Come, lay down.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#5:1> I've a story to tell 'veu.<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>The woman, the stranger with the soft

voice and the veiled face, pulls back the coverlets on the small straw

mattress in invitation.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#6:1> " It 's not so very long, and the ending - - well, the end of my story

will surely capture you.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#7:1> So please try to stay awake, Argyst." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#8:1> Argyst comes into the room, pulls off his dung-covered shoes,

strips off his shirt.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#9:1> He kneels by the mattress for a moment, tempted to remove the veil

from the face of this woman-stranger.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#10:1> " No," she says, " there is no time for that.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#11:1> I must tell you this story."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>Her voice is magic, a soft, musical

voice that enchants Argyst.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#12:1> She pats his mattress impatiently.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#13:1> " Come, quickly now."<p><ICE-USA:W2F-015#> How he wishes this stranger would climb

in with him! Instead she kneels by the bed for a moment, waiting for him to

get himself comfortable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#14:1> Argyst is in bed now, under one of his small coverlets.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#15:1> It 's too warm for anything more than just one.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#16:1> He wonders a moment about this situation, but it doesn't seem as odd

as it might.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#17:1> He waits now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#18:1> The small, graceful woman sits down next to him and begins to speak.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#19:1> " There was a man, a young man in a small village.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#20:1> He tended the cows, as he was poor and a few cows were all that his

father had to give him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#21:1> This young man has few friends, and many of them tease him about his

stench after a long day of work when he comes to the cantina for drink and a

little companionship.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#22:1> He pretends the taunts don't bother him, but they hurt.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#23:1> He wishes he had a friend, a wife, perhaps, to talk to and listen

to." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#24:1> " That 's strange," admits Argyst.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#25:1> " He sounds like me." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#26:1> " Hush, Argyst.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#27:1> I must tell this quickly - - time is running short.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#28:1> One evening, having returned home after a long day of selling milk in

the market, he hears a knock on his door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#29:1> He opens it and finds a woman waiting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#30:1> A rather normal-looking woman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#31:1> He asks if she is waiting for him; she says that she is a gift from

her parents.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#32:1> Her parents say that, though he is poor, he is strong and will sire

good, strong children.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#33:1> For a moment, but no longer than that, he is surprised.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#34:1> He takes her in, listens to her talk about her life for a while,

saying nothing of his.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#35:1> He feels there is nothing to tell. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#36:1> " After a short while, he is aroused.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#37:1> And now he has a woman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#38:1> He takes her to bed, she neither protesting nor inviting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#39:1> They--"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>The woman pauses, gestures with both hands.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#40:1> " We can imagine what they do.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#41:1> And they do this many nights thereafter, as well, following long days

of showing the woman his cows and training her to talk to them, soothe them,

milk them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#42:1> And clean up after them." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#43:1> The woman-stranger is silent now, but Argyst thinks she must be

smiling. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#44:1> " After a while, the woman begins to feel sick and can't join her

mate in the fields.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#45:1> Her belly begins to swell.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#46:1> And near nine months from the time she had arrived, she gives birth.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#47:1> Twins.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#48:1> Fine young male twins.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#49:1> Their parents celebrate, when their mother is strong enough to do so"

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#50:1> " The man and woman raise these twins as best they can.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#51:1> The boys are beautiful, strong.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#52:1> They reluctantly help their parents out sometimes, but they sneak off

at other times to watch the warriors training in the town."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>She pauses for

a moment. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#53:1> " Young girls pine for these twins and spend many hours talking

about them and how pleasing it would be to serve them, wife to

husband."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>There is distaste in her voice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#54:1> She continues, " The twins do not pay attention.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#55:1> All of their attention is on the warriors.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#56:1> They ignore offers to work and to apprentice.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#57:1> Eventually they are old enough to join the small town military, and

the captain takes them on without testing of any sorts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#58:1> They are the perfect warriors, strong, quick, silent.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#59:1> Oh, I'm taking too long. 'mICE-USA:W2F-015#>She is speaking to herself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#60:1> " Must hurry; she 's readying herself."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>Argyst wonders what she 's

speaking of and waits for her to start again. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#61:1> " The twins are favorites with the captain; they become his

enforcers, his right-hand - - and left-hand, I suppose - - men.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#62:1> When he dies, they are at the top.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#63:1> They quickly show their true nature: they are violent and cruel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#64:1> Any who choose to disobey them are tortured.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#65:1> Soon no men thwart them; now the military is under the twins'

control.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#66:1> They make rounds of the rapidly growing village, enforcing production

as they see fit.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#67:1> Any women who take their fancy are captured, locked in a chamber,

raped as the twins will.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#68:1> Many die.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#69:1> Some give birth.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#70:1> The twins kill the babies; they see no purpose in keeping them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#71:1> A woman comes to them one day, a beautiful, proud woman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#72:1> One twin attempts to grab her - - he thinks she would be a beautiful

addition to their growing collection.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#73:1> She has him on the ground in an instant.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#74:1> 'I am not weak, as you are,' she tells the twin on the ground.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#75:1> 'Now,' she says to the standing twin, 'I have come to offer myself to

you.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#76:1> As a proper wife, not a bitch in a jail.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#77:1> Come with me, let us be married.' And so they are.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#78:1> This woman bears a child, a female child.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#79:1> Many would be disappointed, would blame the woman for this curse.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#80:1> A female! But her husband does not, because any child of hers will be

strong, will join him in battle.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#81:1> She is unique, so different from any other woman.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#82:1> He is glad to have her, and he does not take advantage of her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#83:1> He couldn't; she could kill him in a moment." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#84:1> " One day, though, the woman becomes sick.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#85:1> No one knows what the ailment could be, and no one can help.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#86:1> She dies after a long struggle.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#87:1> Her angry husband becomes more vengeful than ever before.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#88:1> He and his twin dominate the village and make plans to extend their

rule." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#89:1> " The daughter is growing, and she is even more beautiful than

her mother, and stronger.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#90:1> She is trained as a male and fights as a male.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#91:1> Her father watches her grow, and he begins to desire her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#92:1> He follows her sometimes, and he beats any man or boy who looks at

her."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>There is fury now in the woman-stranger 's voice. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#93:1> " He rapes her now in the night, takes her against her will.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#94:1> He would like for her to become pregnant with his child, but it

doesn't happen.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#95:1> She had earlier found a witch-woman to make her sterile - - she would

never want to be burdened with a child.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#96:1> That she will not become pregnant angers her father; he abuses her

and rapes her more violently than ever before."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>The woman-stranger speaks

calmly to Argyst now, who is enthralled and horrified by her story. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#97:1> " She leaves one day, when her father is off torturing the poor

villagers, enforcing his duty levels.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#98:1> She leaves with a stranger, a woman who claims that she has many

magics to teach her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#99:1> This woman tells her many times how strong her magic will be once it

is developed....
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#100:1> Oh, no, she 's leaving just now!"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>The woman-stranger is distraught.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#101:1> " I'm sorry - - I 'mst hurry and leave some things out. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#102:1> " The woman learns these magics, all manners of spells, and

becomes a more powerful sorceress than any have ever seen or suspected.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#103:1> When her teacher dies, she reads through the childish writing of her

once-instructor, finishing the lessons on her own. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#104:1> " She goes back to her village, travels through many villages

that are now controlled by her father and uncle.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#105:1> It has been years, but she is as angry as ever. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#106:1> " She waits in the forest by her village until night.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#107:1> She feels her uncle 's presence, hurries to him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#108:1> He is alone in bed.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#109:1> She wakes him and runs him through with his own sword, though she

has her own - - the action appeals to her sense of humor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#110:1> It is her uncle 's misfortune that he had claimed no need for guards,

relying on his own skills. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#111:1> " Now she hunts for her father.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#112:1> She finds him with many guards about and challenges him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#113:1> He does not recognize her voice and cannot see her through her veil.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#114:1> 'I do not fight women, bitch,' he says.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#115:1> The guards are laughing, and one attempts to grab her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#116:1> She pulls him toward her, snaps his arm.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#117:1> He is wailing now, and none of the guards are laughing.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#118:1> They aren't quite sure what to do.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#119:1> " 'You will fight a woman now.' Her father draws his sword, and the

guards move away.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#120:1> It is a short fight.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#121:1> Before he even advances, she has him spilling his insides: she is

superior.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#122:1> The guards grab her, though she has won fairly, and a physician is

called to heal her father.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#123:1> She is thrown into jail to await her father 's wrath. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#124:1> " Soon he comes to her--" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#125:1> " Hello?
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#126:1> Argyst?"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>There is a woman 's voice calling from the door. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#127:1> " Tell her to wait, Argyst - - tell her you must get dressed!"

the woman-stranger hisses at him. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#128:1> Argyst shouts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#129:1> " I've got 'veclothing on.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#130:1> Let me make myself decent!"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>He is impatient now - - the story must

be coming to an end.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#131:1> " Get on with it, if you're in 'reh a hurry."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>Argyst is tense,

wondering who is at the door.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#132:1> He has more than one reason for wanting her to hurry. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#133:1> " Yes...
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#134:1> her father comes now, unveils her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#135:1> He is shocked.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#136:1> There is a man with him, a man with odd equipment that she has never

seen before.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#137:1> 'Do it, mark her skin.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#138:1> Her forehead.' He stands at the door while the man marks her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#139:1> Despite her pain, she is silent.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#140:1> " The marking-man leaves, and her father stays for a moment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#141:1> 'Just think of the pleasure we will have, you and I.' He laughs.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#142:1> 'But now I've mor 'veressing matters to which I must attend, so you

must wait for me.' " He leaves--"</P>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#143:1> " Argyst, what is taking you?"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>The woman shouts impatiently

from outside. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#144:1> " Tend your cows, woman - - it'll be 'llother moment or

two!"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>Argyst is burning with curiosity about what is going to happen in the

tale, not worried about the woman waiting outside his door.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#145:1> The stranger continues quickly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#146:1> " The woman knows she cannot kill her father now; he has thought to

put magical protection put on himself.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#147:1> " Something else comes to mind.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#148:1> She puts her veil on after touching the mark on her forehead,

crouches in the center of the floor.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#149:1> She closes her eyes. "
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#150:1> In a moment, she is gone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#151:1> She hasn't simply left the cell, transported herself away from the

jail - - she has moved to another time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#152:1> It is the only way she knows to win, to undo all of her father 's

evils, rid the people of this demon-man."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#153:1> " Where did she go?"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>Argyst asks, utterly caught in the

story.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#154:1> The woman-stranger reaches for her veil now, pulls it off.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#155:1> " Can you tell me, Argyst, what the mark on my forehead is?
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#156:1> I have no way of knowing."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#157:1> " Why, yes," says Argyst.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#158:1> " It 's a dragon wrapped around a sword--"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>Something comes to him.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#159:1> " No," he whispers, and moves back toward the wall.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#160:1> " The only way I may undo all of these wrongs is to kill his father.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#161:1> His poor father, Argyst."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>Argyst closes his eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#162:1> " There 's no way around it, is there?"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>A tear slides down his

face.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-015#163:1> " No, Grandfather," she says, and holds him to her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#164:1> " This is how it must be.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#165:1> I give up as much as you, remember: I will never live."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>She holds

out her hand, closes her eyes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#166:1> A form takes shape in her hand.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#167:1> It is a small vial.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#168:1> " Drink this, Argyst.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#169:1> Quickly."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>He does so, more quickly than she would have even

imagined.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#170:1> He has no desire to dwell before he slips away.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#171:1> He has never sacrificed so much, and never sacrificed so quickly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#172:1> " Damn it, Argyst, I've 'veen waiting long enough!"<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>A woman marches

into his room, stopping when she sees the beautiful stranger in white holding

Argyst, her long red hair flowing over his face.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#173:1> This woman is at a loss for words, stands at the doorway mute.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#174:1> The woman-stranger closes her eyes now.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#175:1> The end is very near.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#176:1> She begins to cry.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#177:1> Never in her life has she cried, and now the tears fall freely.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#178:1> " Oh, good-bye...
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#179:1> I don't want to leave...." Argyst falls limp and the marked woman in

white spasms briefly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#180:1> " Never tell anyone of this, woman," she whispers, and vanishes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#181:1> The woman runs to Argyst.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#182:1> " What has happened to you?
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#183:1> In God 's name...."<ICE-USA:W2F-015#>She leaves quickly, to find someone to help her

with the body.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#184:1> Everyone presumes the causes for Argyst 's death are natural, as

there are no reasons to believe otherwise.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#185:1> And yet, as an anonymous woman walks by his small hut, she remembers

something for a moment.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#186:1> She stops, tries to catch hold of it: a memory of things that never

happened.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#187:1> She shakes her head.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#188:1> It 's gone.
<ICE-USA:W2F-015#189:1> </I>
