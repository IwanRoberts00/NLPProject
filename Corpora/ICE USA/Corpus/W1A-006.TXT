<ICE-USA:W1A-006#1:1> <h> Historical Flashbacks</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#2:1> I never thought history would invite me for a grand gala of the

1800 's.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#3:1> I could not believe that I would be in the midst of hoop dresses,

tailored suits, servants, and home-drawn, black leather carriages.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#4:1> Finally, history had decided to reveal its wonders to someone of the

present.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#5:1> No longer would history be a book of musty pages and mildew travel

chests.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#6:1> For the first time, history wasn't my enemy, but an acquaintance.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#7:1> I stood in the valley among elderly Walnut trees whose branches

bent lifelessly against the ground waiting patiently for a kind Samaritan to

relieve them of their agony of age.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#8:1> As I looked around the grove of trees, there among the Walnuts stood

graceful Willow.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#9:1> These Willows hide their mournful souls for the causalities of the

unforgiving wars behind their graceful limbs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#10:1> They seem to dance in the gentle winds as they are performing an

elegant ballet respectfully for their audience, all of the trees and the

forest creatures.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#11:1> The elder members of the grove watch over the young chipmunks,

rabbits, and birds which playfully entertain them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#12:1> ( They do not seem to mind the youngsters climbing on their trunks

and limbs; often throw them into the air like a first time father carefully

and playfully throws his child into the air, then anticipating their descent

into their secure and protective arms below) The wild flowers, Violets,

Black-Eyed Susans, Dandelions, and Lilies, are carefully placed within the

grove as the beautiful floral patterns often used in the fashion of this

time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#13:1> As I begin to turn my attention away from the grove, I catch a

glimpse an even greater wonder.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#14:1> I look beyond the eight flights of cobblestone steps to see the most

beautiful sight I have ever witnessed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#15:1> Before I realized what was happening, my feet was already carrying me

toward this vision of historical beauty.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#16:1> As I reached the top of the worn down and uneven brownish- red

stairway of stone, I stood motionless, overwhelmed by amazement.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#17:1> Cold, vigorous chills raced up my spine, as my brows became filled

with the sweat falling from my forehead.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#18:1> My petite pink silk shirt and navy cotton shorts clung to my clammy

skin, leaving no curve of my figure to the imagination.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#19:1> The long hike up the stairway had filled my entire out of shape body

with pain and had stolen my oxygen from my lungs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#20:1> I felt ever vein in my brain pumping and my ears were filled with

only one sound, the rhyme of my irregular heartbeat.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#21:1> My legs, unstable like that of a newborn calf 's, could not carry my

weight any longer and finally gave out.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#22:1> It was at this moment I decided to rest and enjoy the wonder in front

of me.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#23:1> My eyes follow the towering Gothic giant from its sturdy legs to

its beautiful face.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#24:1> It stands on a well constructed foundation made out of mortar and

hand fired bricks.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#25:1> Its body is also handmade, but is not completely parallel.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#26:1> Yes, this is an imperfection, but doesn't cause its beauty to be

relinquished.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#27:1> This giant 's body is crowned with a copper weather vane, which

offsets its reddish complexion.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#28:1> It is definitely the most exquisite site I have ever seen in my

life.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#29:1> This mansion sits proudly on the green hillside as it protects

the sleepy little township below.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#30:1> The view of the township is lovely.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#31:1> The rolling, well- groomed pastures and the brown, fertile fields

protect the colorful and various sized homes from the surrounding counties.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#32:1> From the mansion 's view, the entire scene reminds me of a dazzling

homemade quilt: all of the stitches sown carefully by hand, and each piece of

material selected with great consideration and the entire quilt made with

care.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#33:1> The mansion is the last stitch added to the most important piece of

the traditional Wedding Ring pattern.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#34:1> I notice that the mansion greets the steamboats, leisure boats,

and barges with a firm wave hello as its black shutters flap in the whirling,

yet refreshing wind.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#35:1> The boats, life long friends with the mansion over countless years,

return the warm greeting with a heart felt blow of the foghorns.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#36:1> The entire valley is filled with the exchange of salutations between

life long friends, who time will never separate and who do not keep account

of wrongs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#37:1> It is a friendship built on understanding and compassion, not blame

or spite. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#38:1> I decided to venture inside and become more acquainted with my

new found friend.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#39:1> As I walk on the tall, white porch and look at the front door I am

very excited about what I see.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#40:1> The eight feet tall door 's panels form into the shape of a cross.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#41:1> The cross is used to let visitors and soldiers to know Christians

live in the household.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#42:1> I opened up the immense wooden slab, only to find a world of dated

relics and memories.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#43:1> The Parlor 's red velvet curtains; green handwoven tapestry;

imported cherry card table from England complete with clawed feet; porcelain

vases and a horse-hair, high backed sitting couch elegantly set the mood of

this warm, friendly room.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#44:1> As I stand in the middle of the room, I shut my eyes and remain

silent.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#45:1> Suddenly my mind is flooded with images of tall, dark-haired

gentlemen dressed in suits dancing, talking and engaging in old-fashioned

games, such as checkers, cards and dominos, with the company of well groomed,

fair completed ladies whose social graces are the very finest.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#46:1> I envision waltzing and classical romantic music filling this

beautiful room.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#47:1> I also see young ladies andd gentlemen courting according to the

social ritual of the time as their parents watch them very carefully as the

mother works on her needlepoint and the father smokes a cigar and exhales the

circular puffs of smoke in the room.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#48:1> I am abruptly taken from the Parlor into the Music Room.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#49:1> I stand amazed as in front of me on small metal rollers proudly sits

a Piano Forte.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#50:1> Beethoven and Mozart would be in a musician 's Heaven.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#51:1> Before me, sits an instrument made of fruitwood which consists of

part piano and part harpsichord.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#52:1> As I glance around the remaining room, I see a Lincoln backed chair

which is exactly like the one in White House.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#53:1> I also see a crimson, turquoise and frosted rug.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#54:1> But what grabs my attention to this rug is that it is handmade from

one-hundred percent wool fibers and consists of three, three feet sections

which are stitched together.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#55:1> The bright colors light up the rarely used somber room.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#56:1> My gracious and knowledgeable hostess explains that this room is only

use when important guests, such as Mr.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#57:1> and Mrs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#58:1> Abraham Lincoln-first cousins of House master, and George Washington

a family friend, arrive for what usually becomes a brief, yet exciting visit.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#59:1> This room is full of romantic music, freshly cut flowers, and

interesting intellectual conversation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#60:1> The Informal Dining Room leaves me emotionally drained; however,

very intrigued.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#61:1> This spiritless room touches my heart.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#62:1> As I silently stand in the room 's archway, I glance up a steep,

perilous stairway that leads upstairs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#63:1> The oak steps are only four inches wide and contain twenty steps

total.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#64:1> It is the historical reference which causes me concern; this is the

stairway servants were made to climb while carrying heavy food platters and

porcelain chamber pots above to the bedrooms.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#65:1> I can not imagine how the servants could scale the narrow " death

trap" without having any rope or rails to hold onto and not spill anything in

fear of getting punished for any catastrophe.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#66:1> The Formal Dining Room is the most stunning chamber in the lower

level of this historical home.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#67:1> It is decorated with century old, brass oil lamps; powder-puff blue

china dishes; red velvet curtains, which are draped back with golden, twisted

rope tie backs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#68:1> The cherry dinner table seats twelve persons and still offers plenty

of elbow room for each guest.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#69:1> A large screen door ventilates this colossal vision of historical

beauty and splendor.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#70:1> A mirror designed from Bird 's- Eye Maple offsets the formality of the

dark- colored cherry mantle, which secure the safety of valuable China and

porcelain figurines.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#71:1> This room fills my mind with images of Christmas and Thanksgiving

dinners, engagement announcements, and birthday celebrations.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#72:1> As I remain stationary in the hallway of the lower level, I

notice the oil chandelier dangling lifelessly from the pale, plaster ceiling

above me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#73:1> Its immense flame reflects through the glass doom and casts

reflections of shadow puppets on the dim hallway walls.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#74:1> And in the midst of all this, lies a gracefully bent, cherry and

white pine stairwell.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#75:1> This long, thirty stepped stairway leads to the mysteriously hidden

second level, better known as the bedroom level.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#76:1> I reluctantly ascend up the broad stairway upon my hostess 's

request.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#77:1> To my surprise, there is an ebony, mink- haired couch.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#78:1> Inquisitively I ask my hostess the nature or purpose of this

exquisite piece of furniture.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#79:1> " Leisure reading, conversation between mother and children

concerning school or the family, and quilting and needlepoint gatherings

among local women" is the response I was given.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#80:1> This upper level is pretty as a result of its simple decor.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#81:1> There are four bedrooms total within the upper level, all complete

with high- rise, walnut beds; cherry chiffaros; wash basins; chamber pots and

homemade quilts for warmth and a comfortable night 's rest.</p> <p

<It is the floor length window at the far end of the hallway of the upper

level, which creates the atmosphere for this part of the house.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#82:1> The window offers an overlook of the green, rolling extended lawn in

front of the house.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#83:1> This lawn, as it is explained to me, is better known by the

townspeople " Butler 's Grove".
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#84:1> It is a common meeting place for the local socially elite to play

crochet; gather for church picnics; wedding ceremonies; political rallies and

a temporary battlefield for local disagreements; gun fights, often over

ladies; card games, or money.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#85:1> It is at this window, out on the black shingled, extended porch ledge

which General Orlando Butler, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and other

famous persons addressed the small township of Port Royal in the 1800 's.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#86:1> This house amazes me because the history of decades past silently

anticipate the presence of a gracious and mannerly guest as it hides

fragments of interesting stories in the nick and crannies of both levels.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#87:1> The lower hallway rings with shouts of battlefield victories, as the

Master of the house rides in on his horse through the tall front door and

stops his horse in the middle of the hallway and shouts, " We've 've.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#88:1> It 's finally over.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#89:1> We've 'ven".
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#90:1> This hallway receives its guests with the utmost respect and a very

warm welcome, complete with the stern handshake and gentle hug as to follow

the 1800 's rule of social etiquette.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#91:1> I open the door to the house and step onto the front porch.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#92:1> I sit down on the steps of this small but cozy porch and look down at

the green, fertile lawn below me.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#93:1> I hear the echoes of children laughing as they roll up into firm

little balls and they roll down the rolling grassy hillside.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#94:1> I can hear the gunshots of the century 's gentlemen settling

disagreements with the weapons of the time.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#95:1> I can hear the sound of large groups of people laughing, telling

stories and reminsing over time gone past.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#96:1> I smell the scent of Spring flowers and feel the cool breeze softly

rubbing against my pale, youthful skin- a result of Oil of O'Lay.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#97:1> I see the image of children playing old-fashioned games, such as Hoop

Rolling, Red Rover, and Simon Says, as the older generation enjoy maze,

created from hay bales formed into various shaped lines and angles,

solving.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-006#98:1> I am sitting in the presence of historical elegance, social

grace, and dated furniture and traditions.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#99:1> I don't think I will ever be able to swallow all of this history;

however, I would like to try.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#100:1> Today is the first time I have been introduced to this mansion, but

I have all summer to become better acquainted.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#101:1> I have just met my friend for the next three months.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#102:1> I saw today what will be my historical home where I will conduct

public tours, carefully clean, and protect under the title of Recreation

Department Staff of Kentucky State Park Systems- Head Tour Guide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-006#103:1> I am excited about the flashbacks to history to come if they 're like

the one I experienced today.</p> </I>
