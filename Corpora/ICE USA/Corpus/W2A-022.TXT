<ICE-USA:W2A-022#1:1> <h> <it> Abstract .</h> </it>
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#2:1> - - Diets of northern squawfish <it> Ptychocheilus oregonensis </it> ,

smallmouth bass <it> Micropterus dolomieu </it> , walleye <it> Stizostedion

vitreum </it> , and channel catfish <it> Ictalurus punctatus </it> from John

Day Reservoir were examined to determine the extent of predation on juvenile

salmonids during seaward migrations of the salmonids during April-August

1983-1986.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#3:1> Juvenile Pacific salmon <it> Oncorhynchus </it> spp. and steelhead

<it> 0. mykiss </it> were the most important food group ( by weight) of

northern squawfish - - about 67&percent;-- but made up smaller proportions of the

food of the ether predators: channel catfish, 33&percent;; walleyes, 14&percent;; smallmouth

bass, 4&percent;.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#4:1> Seasonal changes in diets indicated that northern squawfish preferred

juvenile salmonids in May and August ( generally the peak of salmonid

out-migration), and switched to prickly sculpin <it> Cottus asper </it> when

numbers of juvenile salinonids declined; walleyes and smallmouth bass showed

a preference only for prickly sculpin among the prey fishes analyzed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#5:1> As judged by dietary composition and prey selectivity, the northern

squawfish was the major fish predator on juvenile salmonids in the reservoir;

channel catfish also were important predators in the upper reservoir in

spring.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#6:1> Walleyes and smallmouth bass were much less important predators on

salmonids, and appeared to select subyearling chinook salmon only in August

when the distribution of this prey overlapped with that of the predators.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#7:1> Size-selective predation by northern squawfish may also play an

important role in reducing survival of the smaller individuals within each

run of out-migrating juvenile salmonids.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#8:1> A complex of factors that included overfishing, watershed

disruption, and dam building contributed to the decline of salmonid fisheries

in the Columbia River.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#9:1> Historically, the Columbia River system was the greatest producer of

chinook salmon <it> Oncorhynchus tshawytscha </it> and steelhead <it> 0.

mykiss </it> in the world ( Stone 1878; Evans 1977).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#10:1> Declines of the salmonid spawning runs were not apparent until the

boom period of the canning industry in the late 1800s, although the runs were

still substantial in the early 1930s ( Craig and Hacker 1940; NPPC 1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#11:1> During 1928-1932, about 3,820 commercial fishermen ( not including

Indians) harvested an average annual catch of about 13.5 million kilograms

from Columbia River stocks, exclusive of ocean catches; the catch of all

salmon and steelhead in 1933 was about 11.8 million kilograms ( Craig and

Hacker 1940).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#12:1> The Northwest Power Planning Council ( NPPC) adopted a salmonid run

estimate of 10 to 16 million adults in the Columbia River system before any

dams were built ( NPFC 1986); and Chapman ( 1986) estimated 7.5 million (

neither estimate included harvest by Indians).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#13:1> Total runs of salmonid adults were about 2.5 million fish in the mid

1980s, as judged by counts at dams ( Chapman 1986).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#14:1> Construction of dams for hydropower, flood control, and

irrigation, combined with the effects of overfishing, logging, grazing,

farming, and mining, caused drastic reductions in Columbia River salmon and

steelhead populations ( Craig and Hacker 1940; NPPC 1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#15:1> From 1933, when the first main-stem dam was completed, to 1975 ( when

the last of 28 dams composing the Federal Columbia River Power System was

completed) the annual commercial catch of salmon declined from about 9.5 to 3

million kilograms.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#16:1> More than half of the accessible natural spawning habitat was lost (

NPPC 1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#17:1> The dams impeded or blocked upstream spawning migrations of adults,

altered the river 's dimensions, flows, and temperatures, and increased the

mortality of juveniles as they migrated back to the sea ( Raymond 1968;

Trefethen 1972; Schwiebert 1977).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#18:1> Mortality of juvenile salmonids has been increased because of

diseases introduced from hatchery stocks ( developed to rehabilitate runs),

gas bubble disease from nitrogen supersaturation at dam spills, delayed

migrations and asynchronous smoltification, direct mortality from dam

turbines, and increased predation ( Raymond 1968, 1969, 1979; Bently and

Raymond 1976; Ebel and Raymond 1976; Ebel 1977; Rosentreter 1977; Weitkamp

and Katz 1980; Zaugg et al. 1985). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#19:1> Predator-prey relations, the subject of this and subsequent

papers in this issue ( Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991; Rieman et al. 1991; Vigg

et al. 1991), have been altered by dams in several ways.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#20:1> The relatively still reservoirs behind dams disorient juvenile

salmonids, slow their out-migrations, and expose the fish to high

temperatures.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#21:1> At the dams, fish become concentrated near spillways or other passage

routes and endure considerable stress as they pass to the tailrace below.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#22:1> All these factors can affect the vulnerability of young salmonids to

predation.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#23:1> The magnitude of predation has been difficult to measure, but

Ruggerone ( 1986) estimated that ring-billed gulls <it> Larus delawarensis

</it> consumed about 2&percent; of tile peak spring migration of juvenile salmonids

below Wanapum Dam, Columbia River. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#24:1> The northern squawfish ( see Table 1 for scientific and common

names of fish mentioned herein), the prevalent endemic piscivore in the

Columbia River system, has caused substantial depletions of juvenile

salmonids in various waters ( Ricker 1941; Jeppson and Platts 1959; Thompson

1959; Thompson and Tufts 1967).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#25:1> In Lake Washington, which has several species in common with those in

Columbia River reservoirs, northern squawfish are opportunistic feeders that

prey both on limnetic and benthic-littoral fishes ( Eggers et al.,1978).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#26:1> They feed primarily on the most abundant resident prey species,

prickly sculpin, except during seasonally high abundances of the predominant

planktivore, juvenile sockeye salmon.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#27:1> Brown and Moyle ( 1981), who reviewed the impact of squawfish

predation on salmonids, indicated that predation may be substantial in lakes

but not in streams except near dams, water divisions, or other artificial

disruptions of flow.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#28:1> They also concluded that additional studies on squawfish feeding were

needed, especially on the effects of dams and water diversions on predation

during out-migrations of salmonid juveniles.</p> <&> Omitted Tables and

<&> [ FIGURE 1 OMITTED]</&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#29:1> Northern squawfish have become more abundant in the Columbia

River with the development of reservoirs and other predator species - -

walleyes, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass-- have been introduced there.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#30:1> These predators are relatively abundant and feed on forage fishes in

other areas ( e.g., Stevens 1959; Wagner 1972; Johnson and Hale 1977; Knight

et al. 1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#31:1> Maule and Horton ( 1984) documented that walleyes eat young salmonids

in the Columbia River, but concluded that the impact of predation could not

be assessed without fish population estimates.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#32:1> In 1982, the Bonneville Power Administration funded studies,

conducted jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Oregon

Department of Fish and Wildlife, to quantify the effect of fish predation on

out-migrating juvenile salmonids in John Day Reservoir in the Columbia River.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#33:1> Four aspects of predation were studied during 1982-1986: ( 1) feeding

ecology, ( 2) consumption rates by predators, ( 3) abundance and distribution

of predators, and ( 4) total effect of predation on the mortality of

out-migrating juvenile salmonids.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#34:1> The major findings of these studies are reported in four companion

papers of which this is the first.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#35:1> Here we document the feeding ecology of northern squawfish, walleyes,

smallmouth bass, and channel catfish in John Day Reservoir, quantifying the

diets of these four predators temporally and spatially, and evaluating

predation dynamics with respect to out-migrations of juvenile salmonids.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#36:1> <h> <bold> Study Area </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#37:1> John Day Dam was built in 1968 at Columbia River kilometer 347 (

measured from the mouth); it is the third dam upstream from the ocean (

Figure 1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#38:1> It forms John Day Reservoir, which is 123 km long and extends to

McNary Dam.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#39:1> John Day Reservoir has a mean elevation of 89 m above mean sea level,

a mean width of 1.8 km, a mean depth of 8.0 m, a maximum depth of 44.2 m, a

surface area of about 21,040 million hectares, and a capacity of about 3 x

l0~ m3 ( U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, unpublished data).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#40:1> Discharges from McNary Dam are generally highest ( about 64,000 m3Is)

in April and lowest in November.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#41:1> Water residence time varies directly with flow, because there is

little storage capacity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#42:1> Temperature ranges from 0 to 27(C; it is usually lowest in

February and highest in August.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#43:1> Partial thermal stratification occurs in summer; the reservoir is

considered to be polymictic.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#44:1> On the basis of nutrients and primary production, John Day Reservoir

maybe categorized as mesotrophic ( Hjort et al. 1981).</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#45:1> <h> <bold> Out-Migration of juvenile Salmonids </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#46:1> The fishes of John Day Reservoir comprise 34 resident and

anadromous species ( U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished data).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#47:1> The spawning migration of adult anadromous salmonids passing John Day

Dam and entering the reservoir during 1983-1986 was composed of 27&percent;

steelhead, 50&percent; chinook salmon, 20&percent; sockeye salmon, and 4&percent; coho salmon; these

proportions have been similar since the dam was closed in 1968 ( U.S. Army

Corps of Engineers 1986).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#48:1> Hatchery production of anadromous salmonids upstream from McNary

Dam ( mid-Columbia and Snake rivers) during 1983-1986 averaged a 35 million

fish per year, composed of the following species ( in percent): fall chinook

salmon, spring chinook salmon, 33.1; summer chinook salmon, 6.4; coho salmon,

1.4; and steelhead, ( Fish Passage Center 1986).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#49:1> ( Spring, summer fall stocks are named for the season in which a

return to the river.) Spring chinook salmon, and sockeye salmon, and

steelhead generally migrate as yearlings, whereas summer and fall chinook

salmon out-migrate as subyearlings.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#50:1> Natural reproduction of fall chinook salmon, primarily in the

free-flowing Hanford Reach above McNary Reservoir, is relatively high.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#51:1> On the basis of the " passage index" ( dam counts adjusted by flow),

juvenile emigrants at McNary Dam are 34.60, chinook salmon yearlings, 40.8&percent;

chinook salmon subyearlings, 1.7&percent; coho salmon, 10.3&percent; sockeye salmon, and

12.6&percent; steelhead ( Fish Passage Center 1986).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#52:1> Juvenile salmonids emigrate from April to August; most subyearling

chinook salmon migrate in July, and the peak migrations of the other groups

are in May ( Figure 2).</p> <&> [ FIGURE 2 OMITTED]</&>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#54:1> <h> <it> Fish sampling. </h> </it> - -
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#55:1> Diets of predators were monitored from 1983 to 1986 at five locations

in Day Reservoir ( Figure 1; Table 2).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#56:1> Two stations - - the McNary Dam tailrace ( river kilometers 463-470)

and the area near the dam face from v boats are restricted ( here termed "

restricted zone," km 470-470.5)-- were areas influenced by turbine outflow

and spill.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#57:1> Irrigon ( km 444-458) was a transitional zone but was mostly similar

to the tailrace area.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#58:1> Arlington ( km 387-399), the reservoir station, typified habitats

away from direct influence of dams.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#59:1> The John Day forebay station ( km 347-354) was an area where juvenile

salmonids sometimes concentrate before they pass the dam.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#60:1> The Arlington station was establish 1984, the others in 1983.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#61:1> Predators were sampled monthly at each station on a diel schedule

( four consecutive 6-h PC each day for at least three consecutive days) from

April through August each year ( but no July samples were collected in 1983

and 1984).
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#62:1> In 1986, the restricted zone station was sampled every other week

from April through August; all other stations were sampled only in July.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#63:1> Although the sampling design was not consistent and balanced within

or among years ( Table 2), all combinations of locations and months were

covered over the 4 years.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#64:1> Because of this broad coverage and because predator diets turned out

to be temporally and spatially consistent from year to year, we pooled data

or used averages across months, years, or stations to increase sample sizes

without substantially sacrificing accuracy.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#65:1> Predators were collected primarily with a boat electroshocker.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#66:1> However, a semiballoon bottom trawl ( 9-rn headrope) and

multifilament bottom gill nets measuring 60 x 1.8 m with meshes ( stretched

measure) of 8.9, 10.2, 12.7, or 15.2cm were used for 1-h sets at all stations

except John Day forebay to collect walleyes and channel catfish.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-022#67:1> <h> <it> Collection of food data.</h></it> - -
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#68:1> Living predaceous fishes were anesthestized with benzocaine, weighed

to the nearest gram, and measured ( fork length) to the nearest millimeter.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#69:1> Stomachs of small-mouth bass longer than 100 mm and walleyes longer

than 200 mm were pumped with a modified Seaburg sampler ( Seaburg 1957) to

obtain stomach contents; the fish were then released.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#70:1> Entire digestive tracts were removed from channel catfish and

northern squawfish longer than 250 mm; smallmouth bass shorter than 100 mm,

walleyes shorter than 200 mm, and northern squawfish shorter than 250 mm were

preserved whole.
<ICE-USA:W2A-022#71:1> All collections were preserved in 10&percent; formalin.</p> </I>
