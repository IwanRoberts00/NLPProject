<ICE-USA:W1A-012#2:1>

<p> 1) Due to the exclusion acts set against Chinese immigrants throughout

the 19th and 20th century, Chinese parents feel that their children will

suffer from the same discrimination they experienced upon arriving to the

United States.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#3:1> Therefore, the parents " soon discovered that being Chinese was a

liability.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#4:1> Parents saw it in their own lives, and they foresaw it for their

children.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#5:1> Their hope was that education would blunt the edge of discrimination

for the next generation" ( Louie 57).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#6:1> With the fear of the glass ceiling effect, which is the belief that

Chinese immigrants would not be able to obtain higher positions in their

employment due to their race or social class, Chinese parents place intense

pressure on their children to succeed in the educational setting through

familial and cultural pressure.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#7:1> In turn, this presents the Chinese people as the model minority in the

United States.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#8:1> In Chinese culture, they tend to follow Confucius values, which

place emphasis on the relationship between the individual and society,

reverence for the family and elders, hard work, and knowing one 's place in

their family, community, and society ( Zhou, lecture 5 and 8).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#9:1> With the focus on filial piety, a child must have respect and complete

obedience to their parents, creating a strict, disciplined and

pressure-filled household.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#10:1> Thus, a child?s " educational success is very much tied to

face-saving for the traditional Chinese family" ( " Chinese Schools" 3).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#11:1> Since children must obey their parents, they are under significant

pressure to succeed educationally, because it acts as a duty and obligation

to the family as opposed to individual achievement.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#12:1> For parents, they realize that their children may be limited in a

structural sense, such as through limited family wealth, lack of available

social networks that connect to the American economy, and barriers to

employment through racial stereotypes and discrimination ( ibid).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#13:1> Also, parents also take advantage of the American educational system

by " parachuting" their children, in which they send their children at a

young age to the United States to live with relatives in order to receive a

better education and obtain better jobs as they grow older" ( " Parachute"

1).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#14:1> The pressure instilled through Chinese parents causes most of the

children to succeed for their parents so that they can justify the hardships

their parents endured through their immigration experience.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#15:1> Simultaneously, it also may cause some children to rebel and have

negative relationships with their parents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#16:1> As Chinese immigrants began to enter the United States during the

time of exclusion, they created Chinatowns, originally known as " bachelor

societies," which are ethnic communities located in inner cities that

provided social networks for immigrants.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#17:1> In Chinatown, Chinese schools were created to " preserve language and

cultural heritage in the second and succeeding generations" ( " Chinese

Schools" 4).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#18:1> Once exclusion ceased and Chinese immigrants began to reside in

suburbs, Chinese schools became nonprofit ethnic organizations, which acted

as supplementary education that children attended alongside their American

education.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#19:1> At the schools, they incorporate Chinese education while helping with

standardized test preparation, such as the SAT, offering " a more

comprehensive, well-rounded curriculum" ( " Chinese Schools" 9).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#20:1> With expected parental involvement, the schools? main goal is to help

immigrant children succeed in American public schools to attend prestigious

higher education and secure a decent living through high-status professional

jobs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#21:1> Through the pressure from Chinese parents and an intense

educational system, Chinese children have been succeeding in schools,

attending prestigious universities, and obtaining high-level jobs.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#22:1> Consequently, this had formed Asian Americans as a model minority,

which supports the conservative concept of the American Dream and presents

the idea that minorities can succeed in the United States despite legal and

social hardships.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#23:1> Because the Chinese were historically discriminated against in the

past, the fact that they are successful justifies the idea that the American

system is devoid of racism, which de-legitimizes other minorities' struggles.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#24:1> In reality, many cultural and structural factors contribute to Asian

American 's success.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#25:1> 2) When Chinese exclusion first occurred in 1882, ethnic

communities like Chinatowns acted as a social network for Chinese immigrants,

where family, merchant, and district associations formed, connecting

immigrants from the same region and with the same dialect to help them

situate more comfortably in the United States.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#26:1> In contemporary societies, the ethnic communities have transformed as

Chinese immigrants are entering the United States with higher education and

children are having greater access to Chinese schools, which increase their

chances of obtaining higher education, causing a flux of movement into

suburbs rather than Chinatowns.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#27:1> Thus, the organizations have focused more on settlement and

assimilation, providing resources for the Chinese community, which in turn

receives aid from ethnic entrepreneurship.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#28:1> A feeling of ethnic solidarity formed from exclusion through the

ethnic communities, which provide employment opportunities for immigrants

lacking human capital, such as English-speaking skills, job experience, and

employment networks to the mainstream economy ( " Paradox of Ethnicization"

246).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#29:1> For instance, for Chinese women immigrating to the United States

lacking a proficiency in English and job skills, ethnic communities offer

employment opportunities in the garment industry since it requires little

experience, English-speaking, and enables her to contribute financially to

the family as well as attend to her household obligations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#30:1> Consequently, Chinatowns are " considered an alternative path to

social mobility" ( " Other Half" 16).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#31:1> Also, ethnic communities strengthen networks and create community

organization opportunities for immigrants ( " Paradox of Ethnicization" 239).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#32:1> For example, non-profit organizations run by educated immigrants or

the children of immigrants provide a variety of services such as English

classes, job training centers, health clinics, welfare and housing agencies,

and daycare.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#33:1> Thus, the leaders of the organizations " are more concerned with

interethnic relations, citizen and immigrant rights, equality, and the

general well-being of the community" ( " Paradox of Ethnicization 241).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#34:1> Correspondingly, these support networks and groups are more focused

on assimilation rather than segregation from the mainstream society.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#35:1> The ethnic communities act as a place of resources, tangible and

intangible, for Chinese immigrants.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#36:1> With many immigrants attempting to have upward social mobility, they

are more likely to run their own businesses, which contributes to an " ethnic

group 's maintenance of'a controlling ownership stake'" ( " Immigrant

Entrepreneurship" 2).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#37:1> Not only do self-run businesses contribute to the overall economy and

self-sufficiency of the ethnic communities but they also provide employment

opportunities for Chinese immigrants, especially those who do not have the

skills or speaking ability to enter the mainstream work force.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#38:1> This organizational support offers social capital for immigrants,

providing " a dense network of secondary associations, trust, and norms in

creating and sustaining a sense of civic community" ( " Community

Transformation" 2).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#39:1> Economically, the employment opportunities could cultivate a sense of

entrepreneurial spirit, preparing workers to eventually start their own

businesses despite their socioeconomic status.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#40:1> By increasing their financial capital, ethnic communities aid in

moving immigrants out of Chinatowns to affluent suburbs.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#41:1> As the economy arises, so does the ethnic community as a whole,

which represents a labor market focused on services and ethnic-specific goods

that are only accessible to the community.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#42:1> Ethnic entrepreneurs, who are simultaneously owners and managers of

their own businesses and tied to a common cultural heritage realized by

out-group members, fulfill the immigrant dream of owning their own business,

which in turn helps them acquire their other dream of owning a house.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#43:1> Whether they are middleman minorities ( entrepreneurs who trade in

between a society 's elite and the masses) or ethnic-enclave entrepreneurs (

those bounded by co-ethnicity, co-ethnic social structures, and location),

ethnic entrepreneurs provide a variety of benefits for Chinese immigrants,

such as offering employment for those suffering from discrimination in the

mainstream workforce, allowing for workers to receive more pay through

working longer hours, helping women balance labor and familial obligations,

and creating the sense of easier attainment of job opportunities ( "

Immigrant Entrepreneurship").
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#44:1> In effect, ethnic communities set the stage for entrepreneurs and

immigrants to mutually benefit from one another, making the communities an

ideal place for assimilation into the mainstream economy.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#45:1> 3) For both Phillip Guo and Eric Liu, their ethnic identities

were shaped by the way others viewed them in American society and the

differences that emerged when they were compared to people belonging to other

racial categories.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#46:1> With two different backgrounds, Guo and Liu experienced their

identity when they interacted with others in different settings, realizing

that historical stereotypes against Chinese immigrants plague all Asian

Americans in present day. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#47:1> As a Chinese-born immigrant, Guo was constantly immigrating to

various countries and states throughout his childhood, such as to

Switzerland, Louisiana, New York, and California.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#48:1> In each area, he always experienced the feeling of being the only or

one of the few Asian Americans in the group.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#49:1> Additionally, he felt that Americans often classified people under

umbrellas of racial categories, stating that " Americans use the term white

to describe people from a white variety of European ancestries" ( Guo 32); as

such, the same is applied to Asian Americans as well.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#50:1> Upon immigrating to the United States, he soon found that the

labeling of Americans as white played a significant part in the labeling of

his own identity.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#51:1> While attending elementary school in Louisiana, Guo discovered that

he " was branded as white simply because [ he] was told to be white by a

non-white person.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#52:1> [ And for him], becoming American meant becoming white" ( Guo 110).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#53:1> Consequently, he grew accustomed to masking the traits that made him

different from his friends in order to allow him to fit in with his friends.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#54:1> Additionally, he felt that certain ideas, such as a stay-at-home

mother and attending religious services on Sundays, would make him " more

American."
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#55:1> Since he did not have such traits, he realized that he " could never

be white since [ he] was not born that way" ( Guo 67).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#56:1> Although his childhood friends always made him feel welcome, Guo knew

he was different and did not like himself for it; these feelings

unfortunately stemmed from the identity created through his interactions and

labeling by others.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#57:1> As a second generation Chinese immigrant, Eric Liu realizes the

situational aspect of his identity, knowing that his identity as a Chinese

person depends on the context in which he is placed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#58:1> For him, context plays a large role in how Chinese people are viewed,

and he understands that historical stereotypes affect how people categorize

him.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#59:1> Similar to Guo 's experience of categorization, Liu hypothesizes, "

Maybe we're ha 'reired to sort by groups" ( Liu 170).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#60:1> Similarly, he admits that his " Asian American identity was born [

just as he was], roughly thirty years ago" ( Liu 57), suggesting that

identities are alive in America and shape people as soon as they are born.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#61:1> Although he was always proud to be linked to the great Chinese

civilization and never felt the difference between being Chinese and

American, he felt the difficulties of growing up Chinese American in his

looks, love-life, and manners.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#62:1> Accordingly, as a middle-class, suburban resident, he certainly saw

the differences between himself and those who resided in Chinatown, which

connected him more so to his American identity than to his Chinese identity.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#63:1> Hence, there was a significant conflict in Liu 's life between his

Chinese and American realms, despite his feeling of connectedness between the

two, because of the way society portrays the two realms.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#64:1> Through this conflict, Liu is described as a " banana," in which he

is Chinese on the outside and white on the inside, supporting the fact that "

some are born white, others achieve whiteness, [ and] still others have

whiteness thrust upon them" ( Liu 34-35). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#65:1> With Guo and Liu 's experiences and thoughts on what it means to

be white, they have found that their identities are shaped with their

comparison to what society classifies as white.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#66:1> However, with racial diversity continually expanding in the United

States and perceptions constantly changing in people 's minds, there is the

feeling that " America is white no longer, and it will never be white again"

( Liu 56).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#67:1> 4) For Chinese immigrants, obtaining citizenship in the United

States has always been a difficult feat due to exclusion laws and

discrimination.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#68:1> Numerous traits can be attributed to being labeled a US citizen, such

as having the right to vote, serve on a jury, or being able to run for public

office.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#69:1> However, citizenship also entails the possession of basic civil

rights, which are more specific than human rights and are " the rights that

are bestowed by nations on those within their territorial boundaries" ( Zhou,

lecture 10).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#70:1> Nonetheless, possessing membership in the United States is quite

different from citizenship, revealing a difference between being and

belonging in the country.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#71:1> To be a member is more inclusive, in which one feels that they are

accepted by the host country and not just a physical presence with a sense of

existence in the world.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#72:1> With the divide between citizenship and membership, Chinese

immigrants suffer intense scrutiny because of their race and the past

perceptions of the " yellow peril" and " unassimilated alien."
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#73:1> Accordingly, Wen Ho Lee 's case of espionage presents a concrete

example of the discrimination and separation one experiences when a negative

light is shone on Asian people in the United States.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#74:1> When US-China relations become negative, all Asian Americans

become a target, because two out of three Americans feel negatively towards

Chinese Americans ( Lee 330).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#75:1> Furthermore, there was no statistical difference with how Americans

viewed Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans in a survey, revealing

that people tend to group all Asian Americans together in their minds (

ibid).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#76:1> For Wen Ho Lee, a naturalized US citizen and Taiwanese man charged

for mishandling sensitive information, the government targeted him when China

apparently obtained US information on nuclear weapons.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#77:1> Although Lee was Taiwanese, he was immediately viewed as Chinese and

thus the only suspect in the case.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#78:1> As an American citizen, he should have been protected by the rights

of the Constitution, but he was treated quite harshly by the government,

causing Lee to state, " They should have treated me more like a human being

instead of just some Chinese dog or cat whose life and reputation means

nothing" ( Lee 322).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#79:1> Therefore, there is a paradox to assimilation with Chinese Americans

being viewed as the model minority and " perpetual foreigner," plaguing them

as disloyal and dating back to the days of stereotypes such as the " yellow

peril" and " Fu Manchu," which mold Chinese people as scary, dangerous, and a

threat to the American way of life ( " Rethinking Assimilation" 13).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#80:1> Because China and the United States have constantly had conflicts in

the past and one 's racial group status does affect the status of the

individual, all Asian Americans realize that they become a target of negative

perceptions when relations become sour in the United States.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-012#81:1> The question of whether Lee would have been accused so quickly

and harshly if he were not Chinese resonates quite strongly in the air.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#82:1> According to Lee, his situation made him feel that his American Dream

disappeared ( 328).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#83:1> However, he learned one important idea that he strongly shares with

all Asian Americans around the country, which is that " Chinese American and

Asian American people have to stand up" ( Lee 329).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#84:1> For Eric Liu, a self-proclaimed Chinese American, he feels a sense of

paranoia when negative stereotypes and perceptions of Chinese arise,

realizing that if he were placed in a suspecting setting, such as the White

House, during a national security breach, he may very well be a target for

social execution and scrutiny ( Liu 120).
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#85:1> When the Chinese immigrated to the United States, they experienced

discrimination, but with dreams of bringing glory to their family name and

sending money to their families back home, they never believed they would

have to be involved in politics.
<ICE-USA:W1A-012#86:1> Unfortunately, there is a significant divide between a Chinese

immigrant 's sense of belonging and being to a county just as there is between

citizenship and membership to the United States, which highlights the

negative mindset many American possess psychologically toward China.</p> </I>
