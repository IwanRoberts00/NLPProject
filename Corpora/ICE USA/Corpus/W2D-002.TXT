<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#6:1> The Commonwealth of Massachusetts subsidizes thousands of housing

units through a variety of programs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#7:1> These units are available for renters within certain income limits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#8:1> They can be found in new apartment complexes, rehabilitated buildings

such as row houses, townhouses, garden apartments, or even converted

buildings such as former schools or warehouses.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#9:1> Some of these developments may have only a certain percentage of the

units subsidized.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#10:1> Some are available only for elderly or handicapped households; others

are not restricted in this way.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#11:1> There are developments which are publicly owned; that is, they

are controlled by a local housing authority, such as the Boston Housing

Authority, Worcester Housing Authority, Springfield Housing Authority, and

authorities in smaller towns such as Medway, Rockport and Wareham.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#12:1> There are developments which are owned by private housing developers

but are publicly subsidized and therefore available to low income

persons.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#13:1> <h> WHAT IS PUBLIC HOUSING?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#14:1> Public Housing is owned and managed by the approximately 258

local housing authorities and 4 regional housing authorities in

Massachusetts.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#15:1> Not every community in the state has a local housing authority or is

served by a regional housing authority.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#16:1> Most of the larger cities and towns do have housing authorities,

however.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#17:1> The housing authorities are public agencies, governed by state and/or

federal laws.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#18:1> The members of the authority 's Board of Commissioners is elected or

appointed by the city or town.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#19:1> they are separate from local city or town government.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#20:1> <h> WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC HOUSING?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#21:1> Housing authorities operate several different programs for

families, elderly and residents with disabilities.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#22:1> If you have a disability, you may also find units with accessible

features in either a family or elderly-oriented development.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#23:1> You must be at least 62 years of age or handicapped to be eligible

for state funded elderly housing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#24:1> There are developments that have a mixture of all types of

households.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#25:1> Many of the smaller authorities have only one type of housing, so you

have to call to find out if they have the type of development you are

seeking.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#26:1> There are maximum income limits for different size households

wishing to apply for public housing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#27:1> These income limits are set separately by the federal and state

governments for their respective developments and will vary slightly.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#28:1> Income limits change over time and vary for different areas in

the state, so you have to ask about these limits at the housing authority, or

authorities, where you might be interested in living.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#29:1> For example, in 1996 for state-funded public housing in the Boston

area, a single person household could have an income up to

&dollar;29,100; and a four person household could have an income up to

&dollar;41,600. <ICE-USA:W2D-002#30:1> Larger households, of course, could have higher incomes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#31:1> Families and individuals who qualify for public housing pay a

rent which is up to 30% of their adjusted income.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#&percent;2:1> Persons whose annual income exceed the limits established by

either federal or state regulation are not eligible for public housing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#33:1> Likewise, persons who have a consistently poor record of meeting

their rent payments, or who have a history of disturbing people, destroying

property or involvement in illegal activities may not be housed by the local

public housing authority.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#34:1> <h> WHERE CAN I APPLY FOR PUBLIC HOUSING?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#35:1> You should contact your local or regional authority to find out

where they take applications.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#36:1> You can fill out an application for more than one authority,

depending on where you would like to live or how immediate your housing need

is.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#37:1> First, you should call several authorities to see what might be

available and how long you would be on their waiting lists.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#38:1> Then you should go to those authorities where you have your best

chance and fill out an application, even though the location of the housing

may not be your first choice.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#39:1> Applications are also available by mail.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#40:1> Once you have turned in your application you will be placed on

the authority 's waiting list in chronological order ( according to the

submission date of your completed application).
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#41:1> Every housing authority has a tenant selection plan which provides

priority categories to determine the order applicants are offered housing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#42:1> At the time you apply, you should be sure to inform the authority of

any special circumstances you or your family may face so that you may be

placed as soon as possible.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#43:1> In certain housing authorities you will be given a preference if

you choose to be housed in a program where your race is substantially

under-represented.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#44:1> Since the waiting lists vary in length at each authority, you

should inquire about the approximate waiting time when you apply.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#45:1> It is VERY IMPORTANT to keep the authority informed about any changes

in address or status while you are on the waiting list, so that they can send

you notices, and contact you from time to time about mailing list updates,

changes in program regulations, etc.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#46:1> They must know how to contact you when your name reaches the top of

the list.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#47:1> At that time, the authority will contact you in writing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#48:1> You can ask to be placed on the waiting list for every program of

the authority for which you are eligible and qualified, which will minimize

the waiting time for a unit to be offered and help you make the choice about

where you want to live.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#49:1> <h> IN WHAT ORDER ARE TENANTS SELECTED FROM HOUSING AUTHORITY

LISTS?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#50:1> DHCD has Tenant Selection Regulations for public housing

effective as of October, 1986.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#51:1> These prescribe the way housing authorities are required to select

tenants for state funded housing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#52:1> The following are particularly significant:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#53:1> Tenants are to be selected in chronological order, on a first

come, first served basis, within priority and preference categories, such as

for families or individuals who are victims of fire, floods, or natural

disasters.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#54:1> The regulations contain provisions for emergency access for

homeless individuals and families, in certain circumstances, to state-funded

housing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#55:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#56:1> The regulations establish affirmative action requirements for

those communities in which minorities are currently under-represented in the

housing authority 's state-funded housing programs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#57:1> The regulations require those housing authorities to establish

affirmative action placement rates for minority applicants.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#58:1> The regulations provide preference for veterans for admission to

Chapter 200 Veterans Housing or for Chapter 705 Family Housing when no

Chapter 200 housing exists in the particular community.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#59:1> The regulations allow preference for local residents of a given

community.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#60:1> This does not affect local preference being given provided that the

housing authority provides access to minority families in accordance with its

affirmative action goal. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#61:1> For more detailed information on these regulations you should

contact your local housing authority.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#62:1> A list of all authorities administering public housing programs

in Massachusetts is provided in this handbook starting on page 11.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#63:1> <h> WHAT TYPE OF HOUSING IS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL

NEEDS?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#64:1> Most LHAs have some units in their elderly developments that were

built to conform with Architectural Access Board standards of accessibility.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#65:1> LHAs also have some units in family housing with limited

accessibility features.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#66:1> Be sure to note on your application whether you require certain

design features in a unit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#67:1> People with physical or mental disabilities are eligible for

special housing programs as long as the eligibility requirements established

in the regulations are met.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#68:1> Applicants with disabilities are then placed on the Elderly-

Handicapped waiting list.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#69:1> State housing programs for the disabled are referred to as Chapter

689.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#70:1> Units may also be available in Chapter 667 and Chapter 705

developments.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#71:1> <h> WHAT OTHER TYPES OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING ARE THERE?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#72:1> In addition to public housing, there are other types of

subsidized housing developments.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#73:1> These housing complexes are owned and managed by private companies

around the state.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#74:1> Some developments may have subsidies attached to only a certain

percentage of their units, others may have all their units subsidized.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#75:1> Like public housing developments, these apartment complexes can

be large or small, built on one site or scattered on different sites.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#76:1> They serve families, the elderly and/or handicapped residents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#77:1> These various housing developments have no one particular name.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#78:1> They may be financed through the Massachusetts Housing Finance

Agency, the Farmers Home Administration ( in rural areas), or through a

private bank or a community development agency.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#79:1> A list of properties that include some of these programs can be

obtained by calling the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency at ( 617)

854-1000.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#80:1> You should also check your local, regional and community

newspapers for apartments for rent or for SRO/single rooms for rent.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#81:1> <h> WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS HOUSING?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#82:1> There are maximum income limits according to family size, which

govern these subsidy programs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#83:1> These income limits vary by the type of program and they may or may

not be the same limits that apply to public housing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#84:1> You may be eligible for one program, but not another.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#85:1> In general, the income limits of these programs are very similar to

public housing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#86:1> You should contact the management office of the development to

receive more information.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#87:1> The list available from MHFA will provide the names of subsidized

developments and designate whether they are family, elderly or mixed units,

their locations, and the management agent 's telephone numbers.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#88:1> <h> WHAT OTHER HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#89:1> There are some rental assistance subsidies which are not attached

to a specific unit or development.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#90:1> Eligible applicants are issued a rent certificate or voucher and then

they must locate their own apartment in the private rental market.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#91:1> <h> WHAT IS RENTAL ASSISTANCE?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#92:1> The most widely used rental assistance program is the Section 8

Existing Program which is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban

Development ( HUD).
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#93:1> In this program, you pay no more than 30% of your adjusted gross

monthly income for rent, and&percent;the Section 8 subsidy pays the difference

between that amount and the full rent for the apartment.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#94:1> The total housing costs cannot be higher than the maximum rent limits

set by HUD, called Fair Market Rents ( FMRs), for the size of the apartment.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#95:1> In addition to the rent limits, the apartment must meet basic housing

quality standards and pass inspection by housing agency inspectors.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#96:1> Another form of rental assistance funded by HUD is the Section 8

Voucher Program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#97:1> The difference between certificates and vouchers is that there is no

maximum rent set by HUD on the Voucher Program; the tenant may choose to rent

any apartment, regardless of how much rent is being charged provided that the

rent is reasonable as determined by the housing agency.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#98:1> However, the housing agency determines the subsidy amount the tenant

is entitled to receive based on a payment standard established for the

family 's size.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#99:1> This amount is fixed and the tenant must pay the difference between

the subsidy amount and the rent which can be more or less than 30% of the

tenant 's income.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002&percent;100:1> The Department of Housing and Community Development administers

a Section 8 program funded by HUD and a state rental assistance program (

formerly the Chapter 707 Program) called the Massachusetts Rental Voucher

Program ( MRVP) funded by the Massachusetts legislature.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#101:1> The MRVP program is similar to HUD 's Section 8 Voucher Program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#102:1> The subsidy amount is based on geographic location, family income,

and the number of bedrooms needed for the household. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#103:1> <h> WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE SECTION 8 PROGRAM, OR THE MASSACHUSETTS

RENTAL VOUCHER PROGRAM?</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#104:1> Like public housing, there are different income limits,

determined by your household size and the geographic location of your current

residence.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#105:1> Under the Section 8 Program the maximum income in 1996 in the Boston

area ranged from

&dollar;19,800 for a single person household to

&dollar;28,250 for a family of four and more ` for larger families.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#106:1> For some parts of the state the maximum income limits are somewhat

lower.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#107:1> The income limits for the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (

MRVP) are the same throughout the state, which in 1996 ranged from

&dollar;15,480 for a single person household to

&dollar;31,200 for a family of four.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#108:1> These limits increase for larger families.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#109:1> In most cases the MRVP program provides a flat grant amount towards

your rent depending on income and the bedroom size required.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#110:1> With a flat grant subsidy, the tenant must pay the difference

between the subsidy amount and the rent charged by the owner.
<ICE-USA:W2D-002#111:1> The amount of the MRVP voucher is determined by income categories in

increments of

&dollar;1,500, ( i.e. 0-&dollar;1499;

&dollar;1500-1599;

&dollar;1600-1699, etc.), geographic location and bedroom size.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-002#112:1> For the one third of the MRVP Program which is project-based (

the subsidies are attached to specific units), the tenant share is either 35&percent;

of income if heat is included, or 30&percent; of income if it is not.</p> </I>
