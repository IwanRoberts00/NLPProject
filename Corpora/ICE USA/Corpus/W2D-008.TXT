<ICE-USA:W2D-008#1:1> <h> Executive Summary</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#2:1> Spurred on by the passage of the landmark welfare reform

legislation - - the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity

Reconciliation Act of 1996 - - States have made tremendous progress toward

the critical goal of moving families from welfare to work.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#3:1> More families are entering employment, earnings are up, and caseloads

are down. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#4:1> The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF) program has

given States new opportunities to develop and implement creative and

innovative strategies and approaches to remove families from a cycle of

dependency on public assistance and into work.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#5:1> For example, many are turning welfare offices into comprehensive

service centers focused on work or changing policies so that work pays. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#6:1> However, in spite of some dramatic results, there are still

individuals not working or in entry-level jobs, with incomes that are too low

or too erratic to raise their families above poverty.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#7:1> Under TANF, States have the flexibility and resources to develop

programs that reach all families, promote success at work, and convert

welfare offices into job centers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#8:1> The task of welfare reform is far from finished.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#9:1> We encourage States to take the critical next steps to ensure that all

families get the essential supports they need to get a job, succeed at work,

and move out of poverty. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#10:1> The TANF program provides extraordinary flexibility for funding a

wide variety of employment and training activities, supportive services, and

benefits that will enable clients to get a job, keep a job, and improve their

economic circumstances.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#11:1> TANF funds are much more flexible than funds under the prior

entitlement programs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#12:1> So States should start with the assumption that they may use these

funds in innovative ways to achieve the critical goals laid out in the TANF

statute.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#13:1> As a general rule, States ( or local governments and other

agencies where decision-making has devolved from the State agency) must use

the available funds for eligible, needy families with a child and for one of

the four purposes of the TANF program:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#14:1> 1. To provide assistance to needy families; To end dependence of

needy parents by promoting job preparation, work and marriage; To prevent and

reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and To encourage the formation and

maintenance of two-parent families.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#15:1> States must use objective criteria for determining eligibility

and benefits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#16:1> However, they may decide the income and resource standards that they

will use to determine eligibility, and they may set different financial

eligibility criteria for different benefits or services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#17:1> ( For example, they could limit eligibility for cash assistance to

families living below poverty, but provide supportive services like child

care and transportation to working families with incomes up to 185% of

povert&percent;.) Further, since individuals do not have an entitlement to TANF

benefits, States may elect to target benefits to families with incomes below

their established eligibility guidelines.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#18:1> States fund their TANF programs with a combination of Federal and

State funds.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#19:1> While both are very flexible, the two sources of funds entail

somewhat different rules and restrictions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#20:1> Federal TANF Funds. If States use Federal funds provided through

their TANF block grants to provide " assistance," recipients are subject to

work and participation requirements, a five-year time limit on Federal

assistance, data reporting, and certain prohibitions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#21:1> But these restrictions do not generally apply to other services and

benefits that are not " assistance." Also, States have broad discretion to

provide a wide range of benefits and services and to set different

eligibility standards for the different types of benefits. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#22:1> State " maintenance-of-effort" ( MOE) funds.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#23:1> States must spend 80% of their his&percent;oric level of spending ( FY 1994)

- - or 75% if they meet&percent;work participation requirements - - on " qualified

State expenditures" to meet the basic MOE requirement.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#24:1> All MOE funds must be spent on TANF eligible families. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#25:1> This guide suggests some of the many flexible ways States may

expend their Federal TANF and State MOE funds to further the purposes of the

TANF program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#26:1> These examples are by no means exhaustive.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#27:1> They merely serve to illustrate a few of the possibilities that State

and local agencies, State legislators, communities, community-based

organizations, and advocates may consider when designing an array of

benefits, services, and supports that will accomplish one of the four

purposes of the TANF program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#28:1> We hope that the principles and illustrations in this guidance will

promote the design of creative and innovative programs that effectively

address the needs of low-income families.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#29:1> Introduction provides some background information, explaining

what progress has been made on welfare reform, what the funding situation is,

the purposes of TANF, and the purpose of this guide.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#30:1> Considerations in Deciding Whether A Use of Funds is Appropriate

presents a list of factors which a State would consider in deciding what

benefits and services to fund with Federal or State dollars.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#31:1> Federal TANF Funds addresses the basic criteria that apply to the

expenditure of the Federal block grant funds. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#32:1> State Maintenance-of-Effort ( MOE) Funds addresses the basic

criteria for determining whether State expenditures would count as part of

the minimum State financial contribution to the TANF program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#33:1> Appropriate Uses of Funds provides numerous examples of benefits

and services that might be paid for with Federal TANF or State MOE funds.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#34:1> Additional Considerations provides more detailed information

about the potential implications of providing " assistance" and other kinds

of benefits under the TANF program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#35:1> It also provides more detailed information about what kinds of

expenditures are allowable.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#36:1> General Guidance and References identifies additional sources of

information about the appropriate use of Federal and State funds.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#37:1> It also includes a chart summarizing the specific program

requirements that would apply under different State program designs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#38:1> We hope that this guide will facilitate the development and

sharing of creative ideas, and we invite States to send us information about

successful strategies and innovative approaches.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#39:1> We will post them on our Internet page ( www.acf.dhhs.gov) so that

everyone can benefit from this information.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#40:1> Also, we encourage contact with Regional Office or Central Office

staff who are available to answer any fiscal or policy questions about

strategies being considered.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#41:1> Introduction</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#42:1> The purpose of this guide is to show how States may use Federal

TANF and State MOE funds to support working families and to address the needs

of clients with barriers to self-sufficiency.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#43:1> The flexibility available under TANF presents new opportunities for

funding a greater variety of activities, services, and benefits and for

fostering new collaborative partnerships. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#44:1> Because the funding of TANF is complex, State agencies,

advocates, community groups, and State legislators may be unsure about the

array of options available.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#45:1> Therefore, we developed this guide as a ready reference tool that

would promote creative thinking about potential services, supports, and

activities that States might adopt to further the purposes of the TANF

program.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#46:1> This guide presents examples of the many flexible ways States may

use TANF and MOE funds to further the purposes of the TANF program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#47:1> It does not contain new rules or policies.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#48:1> Although it summarizes the general limitations and prohibitions on

the use of funds, we do not intend for it to serve as a definitive policy

manual.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#49:1> States and locales should review the recently issued final rules and

consult with Regional Office or Central Office staff if they have fiscal or

policy questions about strategies they are considering. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#50:1> The guide does not attempt to identify all possible appropriate

uses of TANF and MOE funds, but simply provides a list of representative

examples.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#51:1> Omission of a particular activity or service from the list does not

necessarily mean that associated expenditures are not allowable.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#52:1> Also, inclusion of a particular example does not mean that such

expenditures are categorically allowable, under all funding streams or for

all types of recipients.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#53:1> Over the past several years, States have made great progress

toward the critical goal of moving families from welfare to work, spurred on

by the passage of the landmark Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity

Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( PRWORA).
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#54:1> This legislation created the TANF program. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#55:1> The TANF program has expanded the opportunities States have to

develop and implement creative and innovative strategies and approaches to

remove families from the cycle of dependency on public assistance and into

work.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#56:1> Across the country, we are seeing welfare offices transformed into

comprehensive service centers focused on work.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#57:1> Case managers are being energized by their success in helping

families find jobs and enter the economic mainstream.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#58:1> States have dramatically improved policies to help ensure that work

pays.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#59:1> For example, they are allowing families to keep a larger share of

their earnings, supplementing the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit with

refundable State credits, allowing ownership of more reliable automobiles,

helping families accumulate assets through Individual Development Accounts,

and investing new resources in child care services.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#60:1> The proportion of people who are working after receiving

assistance is much higher than in the past. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#61:1> A variety of " leaver" studies conducted by the States show that

50-65% of families &percent;eaving the rolls are working afterwards. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#62:1> The latest Census Bureau statistics show that nearly one-third of

the families that were on welfare in 1997 were working in March of 1998 -

that 's 1.5 million working parents. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#63:1> Eighteen percent of clients receiving assistance now have

earnings, more than double the level in 1993. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#64:1> The amount of monthly earnings for these welfare families who are

working is up from a monthly average of

&dollar;450 in fiscal year 1996 to

&dollar;592 in the last quarter of fiscal year 1997. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#65:1> The number of individuals on welfare has been reduced by 46&percent;

since President Clinton took office. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#66:1> Even with these dramatic results, there are still individuals

without work or in entry-level jobs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#67:1> While these jobs typically pay more than welfare, they may leave

families with incomes that are too low or too erratic to escape poverty.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#68:1> Some studies are showing that, within a year of finding jobs, 30-40&percent;

of families are back on assistance or still combining welfare with work.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#69:1> It is clear that poverty is significantly correlated with bad

results for families: poor nutrition and health, unsafe housing, dangerous

neighborhoods, and inadequate cognitive development of children.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#70:1> Recent findings from the New Hope demonstration program in Milwaukee

demonstrate that investments in working families - - particularly child care

and health care - - can yield very impressive results in helping families

succeed in jobs and improve the well-being of children.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#71:1> Under TANF, States have the flexibility and resources to

contribute to these kinds of investments.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#72:1> To succeed over the long run, collaboration among a range of

community organizations and of governmental agencies must occur to address

how best to serve clients with needs such as developmental disabilities,

learning problems, substance abuse, mental health problems, rural isolation,

and domestic violence.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#73:1> States decide the services or benefits that are to be provided

using their Federal and State funds.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#74:1> A State must use all of its Federal TANF and State MOE funds to meet

one of the four purposes articulated in the Federal TANF statute or, in the

case of the Federal TANF funds, to continue providing services and benefits

that it was authorized to provide under its former title IV-A or IV-F State

plans ( which covered Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC),

Emergency Assistance ( EA), Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (

JOBS), and Supportive Services).
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#75:1> A State may use its TANF or MOE funds for services and benefits that

directly lead to ( or can be expected to lead to) the accomplishment of one

of these four purposes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#76:1> For example, it could fund special initiatives to improve the

motivation, performance, and self-esteem of youth ( e.g., activities like

those included in the HHS Girl Power! Campaign or sponsored by the Boys and

Girls Clubs) because such initiatives would be expected to reduce school-

dropout and teen pregnancy rates.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#77:1> Both sources of funding provide significant resources for States

to invest in the services that families need to move from welfare to work,

stay in the workforce, and move out of poverty.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#78:1> States have received tremendous financial benefits from the

flexibility available under TANF and the strong economy.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#79:1> Many States have unobligated TANF funds available, giving them an

unprecedented opportunity to invest in families with significant barriers to

employment, provide additional supports for low-income working families, or

design pregnancy prevention and family formation programs. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-008#80:1> In deciding how to best use their TANF and MOE funds, it is

critical that State agencies, including agencies such as child support,

transportation, housing, and child care, develop strong collaborative

relationships with businesses, local agencies, and community organizations in

developing strategies and delivering services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-008#81:1> While States have been enormously successful in placing millions of

clients into work, efforts must extend to reach all needy families, including

those that face multiple barriers to success and who face time limits for

receiving public assistance. </I>
