<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#1:1> There has been continuing concern about the neurologic

manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-I) infection ever

since early reports of neurologic complications associated with acquired

immmunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS) appeared in literature ( 1-3).
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#2:1> Much of the concern has centered around a constellation of

neuropsychiatric symptoms known as AIDS-associated dementia or AIDS dementia

complex, originally described by Snider et al. as " subacute encephalitis" (

3), because it may develop insidiously.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#3:1> It has been estimated that up to two thirds of AIDS patients who do

not develop some other central nervous system disease may develop primary

dementia ( 4).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#4:1> Navia et al. ( 4) and Price et al. ( 5), among others, have

described the characteristic abnormalities associated with AIDS dementia.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#5:1> In general, they include difficulty in complex sequencing, impaired

fine and rapid motor movement, reduced verbal fluency with retention of

vocabulary and object naming, and complaints of forgetfulness despite good

memory retention upon testing.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#6:1> These impairments have been found to be most prominent with testing

formats involving time pressure, problem solving, visual scanning, visual

motor integration and alternation between stimuli.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#7:1> Recently , there have been reports of neurologic manifestations in

early HIV-I infection, before the full development of clinically apparent

AIDS ( 6-8).
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#8:1> While the point at which neurologic impairment first becomes

clinically apparent in the course of HIV-l infection remains uncertain,

hypotheses about the progression of HIV-I central nervous system involvement

from initial infection to end-stage disease have led to increased speculation

that cognitive dysfunction may exist in otherwise asymptomatic HlV-1-positive

individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#9:1> This study was undertaken to attempt to estimate the effect of

seropositivity on Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test scores in

otherwise healthy individuals with early HIV-I infection.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#10:1> <h> MATERIALS AND METHODS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#11:1> The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a

multiple-aptitude battery consisting of 10 individual tests that has been

administered to all civilian applicants for military enlistment during the

past 15 years.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#12:1> It is designed to predict what a person could accomplish with

training or further education, and especially to measure potential for

occupations that require formal courses of instruction or on-the-job

training.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#13:1> It also provides a general measure of academic ability and some

indication of future job performance.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#14:1> There is a large body of literature documenting the validity of the

Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and its components ( 9-13).
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#15:1> The battery is administered prior to the preinduction medical

examination, which since 1985 has included testing for antibody to HIV-I (

14, 15).</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#16:1> For the purpose of this study, the individual tests were

considered in three groups.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#17:1> The first group consists of general academic tests which provide an

overall measure of trainability.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#18:1> These tests are: General Science, which measures knowledge of

physical and biologic sciences; Arithmetic Reasoning, which measures the

ability to solve arithmetic word problems; Word Knowledge, which tests the

ability to select correct meaning and synonyms for a word presented in

context; and Paragraph Comprehension.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#19:1> which tests the ability to obtain information from written

passages.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#20:1> The next two tests, Numerical Operations and Coding Speed, are

perhaps the most important, because while all 10 tests are timed, these two

are performed under the greatest time pressure.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#21:1> The former test requires the performance of 50 arithmetic

computations in a speeded context of 3 minutes, and the latter measures the

ability to use a key in assigning four-digit code numbers to 84 words in a

speeded context of 7 minutes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#22:1> The last four tests are specific vocational skills tests that

measure knowledge in particular areas.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#23:1> Auto and Shop Information measures knowledge of automobiles, tools,

and shop terminology and practices; Mathematics Knowledge tests knowledge of

high school mathematics principles, including basic algebra and geometry;

Mechanical Comprehension measures knowledge of mechanical and physical

principles and the ability to visualize how illustrated objects work; and

Electronics Information measures knowledge of electricity and

electronics.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#24:1> Four individual tests are summed according to the following

formula to derive the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite: Arithmetic

Reasoning Word Knowledge + Paragraph Comprehension + 1/2 Numerical

Operations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#25:1> The Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite is the most widely used

combination of individual test scores.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#26:1> It is used to determine an applicant 's mental category, and it

correlates with an individual 's mental aptitude on other intelligence tests (

15, 16).
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#27:1> Table I provides a summary of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude

Battery component tests.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#28:1> Test and demographic data were extracted from the Military

Entrance Processing Stations induction testing data base for an 18-month

period from October 1985 through March 1987.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#29:1> Records without HIV-l test results or Armed Services Vocational

Aptitude Battery test scores were eliminated, leaving 975,489 observations;

1,283 of these were HIV- 1 - positive cases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#30:1> Five controls per case were chosen matching on US postal ZIP code

alone.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#31:1> using a computer algorithm developed by one of the authors ( F. W.).
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#32:1> This algorithm chose controls systematically with a pseudorandom

start.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#33:1> Of the 1,283 cases. 1.275 matched on all five ZIP code digits for the

full five controls.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#34:1> The rest matched on a combination of three-, four- or five-digit ZIP

codes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#35:1> After matching, the analysis file had 7,698 observations.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#36:1> Exploratory analysis of the data and univariate analysis of the test

scores were performed.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#37:1> Table 2 shows the unadjusted mean raw aptitude test scores.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#38:1> For almost all of the tests, the HIV-l-positive group had a lower

mean score.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#39:1> Because our sample sizes were so large, the standard errors were

small. and all the differences except one were nominally statistically

significant ( by <it> t </it> test, variance unequal) at the <foreign> @

</foreign> = 0.01 level.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#40:1> The magnitudes of the differences were also small, though, especially

with respect to the sample standard deviations, which were much larger than

the actual differences for each of the scores.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#41:1> Therefore, we anticipated that after adjustment for age, race, sex,

and other factors, the HIV-I effect would diminish.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#42:1> Further exploration was done prior to conducting the regression

analysis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#43:1> No non-gaussian distributions were noted among the <it> Y </it>

variables ( test scores).
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#44:1> We then plotted each predictor ( or <it> X </it> ) variable against

the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite to look for outliers and

interactions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#45:1> One extreme outlier was identified and eliminated; no interactions

were found.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#46:1> All individuals who were failed on subsequent physical examination,

due to abnormal skin/lymphatic conditions ( such as enlarged lymph nodes or

benign or malignant tumors of the skin) were eliminated to preclude

applicants from the final analysis who had clinical HIV-I disease.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#47:1> At this point, 7,505 observations remained.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#48:1> Table 3 illustrates some of the likely demographic confounders in

the analysis data set.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#49:1> The HIV-I-positive applicants were more likely to be male, to be

black, to be older, and to have a history of prior military service, all of

which were considered likely determinants of scores.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#50:1> The regression analysis was used to adjust for these and other

confounders and to identify any remaining HIV-l effect.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#51:1> The design fixes the ratio of HIV-1-positive to HIV-l-negative

individuals at 1:5, and by matching on ZIP code, we have attempted to control

for geographic variation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#52:1> To make the regression coefficients comparable with one another,

we adjusted all test scores to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#53:1> Since our outcome variable ( test score) was continuous, a multiple

linear regression model was built.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#54:1> SAS analytical software was used to conduct the analysis ( 17).
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#55:1> To choose the best model initially, we examined main effects and

interaction terms for the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#56:1> The model derived was sensitive enough to detect an HIV-I effect of

approximately 0.07 standard deviation for most of the aptitude tests at

<foreign> @ </foreign> = 0.01.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#57:1> ( That was less than a l-point difference in raw score for each of

the tests except the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite, where it was

just under 1.5 points.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#58:1> Each of the 10 standardized individual test scores was then

regressed on the same group of predictors that was used in the main effects

model for the Armed Forces Qualifying Test.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#59:1> High leverage points with poor fits were identified and eliminated

from each regression, and after the distribution of the residuals was

checked, the regressions were repeated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#60:1> This checking and correcting improved the fits only slightly,

however.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#61:1> Finally, each individual 's Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite

score was used as an independent predictor variable in a final set of

regressions to control for individual variation in basic intellectual

capacity.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#62:1> <h> RESULTS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#63:1> The results of the initial regression analysis using the Armed

Forces Qualifying Test composite as the outcome variable are shown in table

4.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#64:1> The listed effects represent the number of standard deviations that

an individual 's score was predicted to change per unit of change in the

predictor variable.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#65:1> Ninety-nine percent confidence intervals are also shown.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#66:1> Years of education was a powerful and highly significant predictor,

with each year adding nearly 0.16 standard deviation ( SD) to an applicant 's

Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite score.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#67:1> The strongest categorical effects identified were racial/ethnic ones.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#68:1> Women tended to have slightly higher scores than men.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#69:1> HIV-I seropositivity lowered an applicant 's score by 0.09 SD, enough

to be nominally statistically significant; however, the total regression <it>

R </it> 2 for the model was only 0.21, so much of the variability was not

being accounted for.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#70:1> As for the remaining predictors, prior military service was not

significant in these data but was allowed to remain in the model because it

did contribute in some of the later regressions, and we wanted to have a

consistent model.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#71:1> The branch of service for which the individual was applying was also

an independent predictor; applicants to all other armed services tended to

have higher scores than Army applicants.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#72:1> No interactions between HIV-l status and any other predictor were

identified.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#73:1> The results of the individual regression analyses for the effect

of HIV- I positivity on each test score are shown in table 5.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#74:1> The same main effects model was used.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#75:1> In general, HIV-1-positive status tended to lower scores slightly,

while most of the regression <it> R2 </it> values remained quite low,

indicating that much of the variability in test scores w as independent of

the factors in our model.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#76:1> This was expected, however, because if test scores were highly

correlated with demographic factors, rather than individual variability,

there would be no need to administer them as predictors of future

performance.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#77:1> Among the general academic tests at the top of table 5, there

appears to be no HIV-1 effect upon word knowledge or paragraph comprehension,

which is consistent with a priori expectations, based on what is known about

HIV-I dementia.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#78:1> We expected that Numerical Operations and Coding Speed would be the

most sensitive indicators of an HIV-l effect, along with Arithmetic

Reasoning.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#79:1> which involves solving arithmetic word problems.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#80:1> For Arithmetic Reasoning, there was a clearly significant decrement;

for Numerical Operations, there was a marginal ( though statistically

significant) HIV-I-positive decrement; and for Coding Speed, HIV-I-positive

status appeared to marginally improve an applicant 's score.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#81:1> The largest negative effects occurred among the four vocational tests

at the bottom.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#82:1> Because all of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery

test 's components arc to some degree interrelated with each other and with

measures of general intelligence, Pearson correlation coefficients between

the individual tests were calculated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#83:1> Most of the tests correlated fairly well with each of the other

tests, with the exception of Numerical Operations and Coding Speed, which

only correlated well with each other.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#84:1> The Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite, however, correlated well

with all of the tests.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#85:1> Since the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite represents a measure

of an individual 's mental aptitude ( 15, 16), the Armed Forces Qualifying

Test composite score was added as a predictor variable in another set of

regressions to control for individual variation and further isolate the HIV-I

effect on the remaining individual tests, apart from any effect on general

intelligence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#86:1> Those individual tests which are included in the Armed Forces

Qualifying Test composite were excluded from this analysis, with the

exception of Numerical Operations, in which case the composite was calculated

without the Numerical Operations component when used as a predictor variable

for that regression.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-024#87:1> The results of this final set of regressions using the Armed

Forces Qualifying Test composite as a predictor ( table 6) were helpful.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#88:1> The <it> R2 </it> values roughly doubled for all of the test scores,

and the magnitude of the HIV-I effect consistently diminished, with the

exception of Coding Speed, which then showed a significant improvement with

HIV-I-positive status.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#89:1> One must be cautious in interpreting these results, however.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#90:1> The approach used will automatically diminish the magnitude of the

HIV-I effect on the individual tests, since part of the effect is already

included in the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite score as an effect on

general intelligence.
<ICE-USA:W2A-024#91:1> Only the improvement in Coding Speed for HIV-1-seropositives went

against this expectation, as the magnitude increased, and if this test truly

is a sensitive indicator, these results would tend to discount the

significance of the HIV-I-positive effect on the other test scores.</p> </I>
