<p> If the student is taken for a psychiatric evaluation and returns to

school shortly afterwards, I would call her parents and strongly urge them to

put their daughter in therapy with a licensed therapist or psychiatrist if

they have not done so already.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#2:1> I would explain, being careful not to use these exact words that imply

" diagnoses" on my part, that she is exhibiting signs of depression, cutting,

and an eating disorder, and that I think it would be in her best interest to

see a mental health professional on a regular basis for intense therapy.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#3:1> I would have an ethical responsibility to make this suggestion and a

referral, because I am not skilled in treating eating disorders or in

counseling students who cut themselves.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#4:1> I would take steps to increase my competency in these areas, but she

would be better served by a professional trained to help with these issues.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#5:1> I would refer her and her parents to some mental health professionals

in the area who specialize in dealing with eating disorders and/or

cutting.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#6:1> For my part, I would then continue to monitor the student and

would try to provide her with a safe and trusting space for her to share her

feelings and thoughts.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#7:1> I would revisit the " Life Contract" we started together and check in

regularly to assess her progress and level of suicide risk.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#8:1> I might also ask if she would be willing to let me speak to her

therapist or psychiatrist about her progress, so that I could help support

her better in school.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#9:1> If she agrees, I would ask both her and her parents for their written

consent.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#10:1> I would support her in any way I can in school, and I might

specifically work with her on increasing her self-esteem, working on anger

management techniques to encourage her to find other outlets for her anger

instead of cutting her skin, and developing her career aspirations so that

she can create more of a connection with her future.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#11:1> I will engage her in conversations about basketball and her interest

in going professional, and will help her plan how she can work toward her

goal of playing in the WNBA.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#12:1> I will also encourage academic achievement, involvement in school

activities, and exploration of other career interests she may have.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#13:1> I might also advocate to her teachers on her behalf, explaining that

she has been going through some things ( without going into more detail) and

asking if she might be given the opportunity to make up some missed

assignments.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#14:1> I would thank the student for coming to me and assure her that

she is being a good friend by telling a trusted adult about her concerns for

her classmate.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#15:1> I would tell her that I would follow up to make sure that her

classmate stays safe and that she can help her friend by continuing to be

kind to her.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#16:1> I would also advise her to not share what her classmate tells her

with other students in order to avoid the spread of gossip or rumors, which

would probably make her classmate feel even more upset.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#17:1> I would assure her that she can come and talk with me about her

concerns whenever she wants and that if she suspects her friend is in

immediate danger, she should tell an adult immediately.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#18:1> Once the concerned classmate leaves my office, I would first tell

the school principal what I have heard and assure him/her that I will speak

to the parents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#19:1> I would then try to meet with the student before calling her parents

in order to begin conducting an informal assessment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#20:1> According to section A.2.a. of ASCA 's Ethical Standards for School

Counselors, I would have to begin the session by explaining confidentiality

and its limitations.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#21:1> I would then ask her how she is feeling about school and her life at

home and would try to provide a supportive environment for her to express

herself.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#22:1> I would explain to her that others had expressed concerns about her

well being and remind her that I am here to listen and help her.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#23:1> I would explain my need to tell her parents what I have heard in

order to keep her safe, and I would communicate to her that even if she tells

me that her parents already know she has tried to kill herself, I need to

call home to speak with them about it just in case.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#24:1> I would offer to call one or both of her parents in her presence so

that she can participate in the phone call.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#25:1> I would also conduct a lethality assessment to determine if she

currently has suicidal thoughts and whether or not she has devised a suicide

plan.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#26:1> I may ask her to complete a " Life Contract" and would continue to

check in with her regularly.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#27:1> I would meet with her in the future to discuss her feelings about

school and her parents' divorce and would work with her on topics such as

self-esteem and coping with divorce.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#28:1> Either after the student leaves my office or with her, I would

call her classmate 's parents ( both parents if they both have legal rights to

information regarding their daughter) to express my concerns about what I

have heard.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#29:1> Perhaps the student has not actually told her mother that she

attempted suicide, so I would have a legal and ethical duty to warn her

parents just in case.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#30:1> As explained in the previous answer, as mandated after the Eisel case

in Maryland, I would have a legal duty to contact her parents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#31:1> I would want to offer my support and concerns and ask if the student

is actually seeing a psychiatrist for her depression.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#32:1> I would encourage her parents to take her for a psychiatric

evaluation if she has not already had one or is not actually seeing a

psychiatrist currently.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#33:1> I would recommend local mental health counseling services, family

counseling services, and other appropriate resources that may be helpful.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#34:1> I would also ask the parents to provide me with some background

information on her daughter, including when they noticed that their daughter

had become withdrawn and first attempted to take her own life.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#35:1> If the parents ask for suggestions on what they can do to help at

home, I might suggest that they support their daughter by spending time with

her, asking open questions in a nonjudgmental manner, and validating her

feelings.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#36:1> I would also ask her parents if there are specific things they think

I might be able to do in school to help their daughter.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#37:1> I would continue to communicate with them regarding their daughter 's

general progress in the future but would also remind them of the importance

of confidentiality in the counseling environment.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#38:1> According to section B.5.b.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#39:1> of the ACA Code of Ethics, I should explain to the parents my role as

a counselor and the importance of confidentiality in my relationship with

their daughter ( 2005).
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#40:1> I would explain that in order to have a trusting relationship with

their daughter, I would keep what she tells me private, unless I have reason

to believe she is in danger.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#41:1> I would also explain that if they and their daughter feel comfortable

permitting the psychiatrist and I to communicate regarding her therapy in

order to help her in the best way possible, they could provide their written

consent for the sharing of information.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#42:1> I would first discuss confidentiality and its limits in the

counseling setting.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#43:1> Establishing an environment of trust and support would be crucial for

developing a counseling relationship with this student.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#44:1> I would use active listening and open questioning to encourage him to

explore his feelings about his sexuality and the fears he has about telling

his parents that he is homosexual.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#45:1> After the initial counseling session, I might do some more research

on Fontaine and Hammond 's six stages of identity formation.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#46:1> I would keep these stages in mind and try to informally assess what

stage this student might be in currently, so that I can support him in the

most helpful manner.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#47:1> I would ask questions in a gentle, nonjudgmental manner, such as, "

When did you first starting having these feelings? Tell me about what that

was like." According to section A.4.b.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#48:1> of the ACA Code of Ethics, it would be important that I be aware of

my own personal values and attitudes related to homosexuality when working

with this student, so that I am careful not to impose any of my own values on

him.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#49:1> I would also ask him whether or not he has experimented or acted on

his feelings, and if he has, I would talk with him about the importance of

practicing safe sex.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#50:1> Perhaps this student still questions his sexual identity, or perhaps

he has known that he was homosexual for years and is feeling very comfortable

with his identity.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#51:1> He may or may not have given a good deal of thought to how and when

he might tell his parents and what their reaction might be.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#52:1> I would support this student and counselor him against doing or

saying anything before he feels that he is truly ready.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#53:1> If the student talks about feeling confused and is therefore in the

first stage of identity formation, I might first recommend a book he could

read about identifying one 's sexuality.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#54:1> I might also encourage this student to consider joining an LGTB club

at school or in the community if he feels comfortable.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#55:1> This might be a good place for him to explore his feelings with

others and receive support and advice regarding dealing with family issues.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#56:1> I would also give him information about local community agencies that

might offer him some support.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#57:1> I would talk with him about his current relationship with his

parents, discuss his parents' relationship with his brother since his brother

came out, and discuss whether or not he has told his brother that he is

homosexual.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#58:1> I would ask if he feels comfortable talking with his brother before

telling his parents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#59:1> His brother might be able to help him tell his parents or give him

suggestions on how he might go about telling them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#60:1> During this stage, the student needs to feel safe and supported while

he explores his feelings and options.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#61:1> I would explain to the student that I cannot give him any answers

regarding whether or not he should tell his parents, but I might suggest we

discuss the pros and cons of telling his parents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#62:1> This will help him to mentally map out the possible consequences and

outcomes of telling his parents.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#63:1> I would encourage him to share his fears and hopes about telling his

parents, and I might suggest we role play how he could tell them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#64:1> We could role play possible outcomes of his telling his parents and

discuss how he might react to each of them.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#65:1> This would help him explore whether or not he feels comfortable

telling his parents and would help prepare him for dealing with his parents'

possibly unfavorable reactions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#66:1> When and if he does decide to tell his parents, I would provide

support for him, encourage him to find support in close friends or a LGBT

group, and would offer to talk with his parents if he feels that this might

help.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#67:1> I would consider referring him to a mental health counselor if he

exhibits symptoms of depression following his discussion with his parents,

and I would have a legal and ethical duty to tell his parents if I believe he

is in danger of harming himself or if he runs away from home.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#68:1> My HMO healthcare provider covers mental health services.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#69:1> Mental health counseling and chemical dependency counseling are

covered, but family counseling and marriage counseling are not covered.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#70:1> Only individual therapy is covered; group counseling is not covered.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#71:1> There is a twenty dollar co-pay per visit for both mental health and

chemical dependency individual counseling.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#72:1> No referrals are needed to receive mental health and chemical

dependency counseling.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#73:1> Twenty-six counseling visits per year are covered, but counseling

service providers can write referrals to extend the number of needed sessions

per year, and insurance will cover these as well.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#74:1> Inpatient hospital care for all medical services, including mental

health and chemical dependency-related services, is covered by insurance,

minus a one hundred dollar admission fee.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#75:1> My provider covers inpatient hospital care for an unlimited number of

days.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W1A-019#76:1> The ethical and legal issues and counseling topics we discussed

in class were extremely useful and relevant to my role as an aspiring

professional school counselor.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#77:1> Before entering this class, I knew very little about the specific

ethical standards that school counselors should uphold and knew nothing about

the laws we must abide by pertaining to counseling minors, school records,

subpoenas, abuse, and suicide.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#78:1> I have now learned and practiced utilizing the steps to take when

faced with an ethical dilemma.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#79:1> I also particularly enjoyed the class presentations on important

topics and issues school counselors face.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#80:1> As well as gathering useful resources ( PowerPoint presentations and

annotated bibliographies) for future professional development, I also learned

the ethical and legal responsibilities related to each topic or issue

discussed.
<ICE-USA:W1A-019#81:1> I also appreciated the suggestions in each presentation for how

school counselors can advocate on behalf of both students and the school

counseling program.</p> </I>
