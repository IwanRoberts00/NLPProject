<I>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-001#1:1> I've attended 'vee religious services in the two years since

moving to New Orleans than in the previous dozen years.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#2:1> Part of this is sociological: It 's far easier to be a lapsed Catholic

in my native Midwest than m New Orleans, where religious influences pervade

da'lly life 'll promote group participation - or, failing that, sheer guilt.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-001#3:1> But sheer aesthetics have a lot to do with my recent spate of

free-agent pew-warming.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#4:1> From historic to modem, from A.M.E. to Zen, New Orleans teems with

interesting churches and temples, the art and architecture ofwhich could

easily fill a year 's worth of New Orleans magazines from cover to cover.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#5:1> Besides the opportunity to view museum-quality art in the form of

paintings, tapestry, mosaics, frescoes and statuary, random church attendance

provides a Cliff Notes-style introduction to both the history and current

state of the city 's many neighborhoods.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#6:1> ( Does the congregation sing heartily, or are somber, spoken responses

the order of the day? Are there enough kids in the area to provide a steady

stream of altar boys and girls?
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#7:1> Or are the pews sparsely dotted with older worshippers, even during

the major service of the week?) </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-001#8:1> Based on personal treks and the input of local art and

architecture experts, I've creat 'vea list of some visually rich worship sites

- not necessarily " the best" by any stretch; just a selection of interesting

structures.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#9:1> They can be grimly Gothic or illuminated havens.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#10:1> Some churches are amazing exercises in aesthetic excess.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#11:1> Other spaces are starkly beautiful, demonstrating that simple

restraint from renovation run amok can outclass all the resources of the most

moneyed congregation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#12:1> Some have undergone well-executed restorations; many more are scarred

by time or the elements, yet are all the more beautiful for having weathered

the storms of the past. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-001#13:1> Visit these houses of worship and see for yourself.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#14:1> Many churches and temples even offer informational brochures to

introduce visitors to their art and But remember that these are religious

institutions, not tourist attractions.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#15:1> If you attend services, show respect by dressing appropriately,

arriving on time and staying through the end.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#16:1> Bring a few bucks for the collection plate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#17:1> One last note: No matter how lovely the surroundings, don't take

pictures during a religious service.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#18:1> At one church I recently visited, several camera-toting tourists

walked right up to the altar and took flash pictures in the middle of Mass.
<ICE-USA:W2B-001#19:1> ( Holy Hasselblad! Miss Manners, where are you?) </p>

younger boys and girls in 1932 and operated by the School Sisters of Notre

Dame.

cypress angels, were stored in an attic at Newcomb.

the old Sugar Bowl, where it 's said the only remaining angel was found

beneath the bleachers.
