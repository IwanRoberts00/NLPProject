<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#1:1> Infectious diseases stimulated the early development of

epidemiology.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#2:1> Early epidemiologic investigations of infectious diseases focused on

environmental contamination rather than person-to-person transmission.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#3:1> More recently, however, chronic diseases have provided greater impetus

for the development of new quantitative methodology in epidemiology.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#4:1> Now, with the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus infection,

epidemiology is refocusing its efforts on infectious diseases.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#5:1> The risk assessment tools being applied to the acquired

immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS) epidemic are those that were developed for

chronic diseases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#6:1> However, the usual formulation of risk assessment parameters, such as

odds ratios, rate ratios, relative risks, and risk differences, which are so

useful in chronic disease epidemiology, do not provide stable assessments of

risk for factors that affect contagion.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#7:1> Because with contagious diseases the outcome in one study subject is

related to changes in risk for other study subjects, risk assessment at the

population level does not correspond to a summation of risks at the

individual level as it does with chronic diseases.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#8:1> To relate risk assessments at the individual and population levels,

knowledge of contact patterns is essential.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#9:1> The purposes of this paper are 1) to demonstrate the lack of stability

of chronic disease risk measures with contagious diseases, 2) to demonstrate

how risk assessment for contagious diseases depends upon assessment of

contact patterns even when contact patterns do not cause appreciable

differences in the overall epidemic pattern, and 3) to present a new

formulation for the action of one important determinant of contact patterns

in sexually transmitted diseases, namely biased selection of partners from

the potential partners encountered.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#10:1> This new formulation supersedes our previous selective mixing

formulation ( 1).</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#11:1> <h> RISK FACTORS FOR HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TRANSMISSION </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#12:1> Consider the following variables which might be collected in

either prospective or cross-sectional studies of human immuno-deficiency

virus infection in gay males: 1) usual number of episodes of sex acts of type

S, in 1 week; 2) usual number of episodes of another type of sex act, which

we will call S2, in I week; 3) usual proportion of all partners met at site

A,; and 4) usual proportion of all partners met at site A2.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#13:1> All of these variables might be correlated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#14:1> Thus, if the major focus of interest is the risk of the type of sex

act S, its effects would probably be assessed using a multiple variable

analysis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#15:1> Given the dichotomous outcome of infection, the most likely choice

for such an analysis would be a logistic regression analysis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#16:1> The logistic regression parameters could be translated into odds

ratios.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#17:1> From a cross-sectional study, these would be the prevalence odds

ratios; from a prospective study, the incidence odds ratios would be

estimated.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#18:1> In their interpretation of the relevance of these estimated odds

ratios for risk assessment, epidemiologists would most likely use these

parameters directly as approximations to risk ratios or rate ratios.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#19:1> Alternatively, with prospective data, they might attempt to assess

rate ratios or rate differences more directly with a survival analysis.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#20:1> During the course of an epidemic, as the overall incidence rises, the

absolute risk or rate of infection rises.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#21:1> As a consequence, epidemiologists would expect risk or rate

difference measures to vary.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#22:1> However, they are likely to presume that ratio measures will remain

more constant.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#23:1> There may be two problems with such risk assessment procedures.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#24:1> First, inconsistencies of the causal factors generating the data with

the assumptions of the analytic model may mean that the " control" procedures

distort relations instead of eliminating the effects of confounding.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#25:1> Second, even if ratio parameters of odds, risks, or rates are

estimated validly, those measures might not remain constant over the course

of the epidemic.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#26:1> Large odds ratios might be expected to shrink and small ones might be

expected low grow.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#27:1> Thus, the odds ratios, even from prospective studies, would not form

a good basis on which to predict future risk patterns.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#28:1> This paper seeks to illustrate the second problem of parameter

instability without directly addressing the first problem of parameter

estimation validity.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#29:1> Any risk measures that rose or fell dramatically over time would

not be useful for assessing current or future risk.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#30:1> They would be even less useful if they rose or fell even though the

basic causal factors remained constant.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#31:1> One way to assess the expected behavior of an epidemiologic parameter

is to evaluate it in an idealized simulation of the underlying causal

system.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#32:1> <h> COMPUTER POPULATION AND CAUSAL SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#33:1> We create here an idealized computer population and causal system

for human immunodeficiency virus transmission.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#34:1> The point of this model is to abstract the essential phenomenon of

person-to-person transmission in sexual relationships.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#35:1> To avoid confusion and unnecessary complications, we will make

several simplifying assumptions.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#36:1> For example, we will assume that insertive and receptive sex acts

have the same probabilities of transmission and therefore do not need to be

distinguished in our model.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#37:1> Such equal transmission probabilities probably do not pertain to any

type of sex act, and therefore we will stick with symbolic names for our sex

acts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#38:1> Our model will have the following characteristics:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#39:1> 1 ) There are only two types of sex acts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#40:1> S, which is a relatively low-risk type of sex act, and S2, which

carries four times the risk of transmission per act as S.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#41:1> We might think of S, as corresponding to oral sex and S2, as

corresponding to anal sex. or S, as corresponding to sex with a condom and S2

as corresponding to sex without a condom.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#42:1> 2) There are only two types of individuals: homosexual males who

engage in only S, and homosexual males who engage equally in S, and S2.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#43:1> We will consider the first group, lacking the risk factor, unexposed

and the second group, having the risk factor, exposed.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#44:1> 3) Two hundred unexposed persons and 100 exposed persons enter

this population each month.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#45:1> No infected individuals enter this population.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#46:1> 4) People leave the population for reasons not connected with

human immuno- deficiency virus infection at a rate of one per 600 per month,

independent of when they entered the population.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#47:1> 5) Before human immunodeficiency virus arrives, our hypothetic

population is at equilibrium with a steady 120,000 X1 individuals and 60,000

X2 individuals.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#48:1> 6) Once human immunodeficiency virus arrives in this population,

the only source of infection is through sexual transmission.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#49:1> 7) All individuals in the population have 20 sexual encounters

per month, and each encounter is with a different person.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#50:1> 8) Only one type of sex act, either S, or S2, is engaged in at

each encounter, so both partners have to do the same thing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#51:1> 9) There are only two social settings ( or sexual partner

marketplaces) where partners can be met: A, and A2.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#52:1> 10) Within each social setting, mixing is either random or

determined by a selective mixing formulation to be presented below .</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#53:1> 11) One out of 800 sex acts of type S, between an infected person

and an uninfected person results in transmission, and one out of 200 sex acts

of type S2 results in transmission.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#54:1> Since only half of the acts in the exposed group are at the higher

rate, this fourfold difference in transmission probabilities would translate

to a 2.5 rate ratio if the partners of the exposed group and the unexposed

group had equal probabilities of being infected.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#55:1> 12) One out of every 120 infected persons develops AIDS every

month, independent of the time that he became infected.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#56:1> This corresponds to a mean incubation period of 10 years.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#57:1> 13) Persons with AIDS stop having sex.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#58:1> <h> A COMPUTER MODEL OF TRANSMISSION </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#59:1> Using the formulation for structured mixing ( 2) and the

symbolization shown in table 1, the differential equations describing

transmission in our hypothetic population would be</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#60:1> - formula here-

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#61:1> The three terms in the first equation are the inflow of new

people into group I, the outflow of current people for reasons other than

infection, and the rate at which uninfected persons become infected.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#62:1> This third term is the number of encounters of all persons in group I

with all persons in group J in social setting K where sex act S takes place (

Cu) times the proportion of I individuals in those encounters who are

susceptible ( XJ/NJ) times the proportion of J individuals in those

encounters who are infected ( YJ/NJ) times the probability of transmission

given sex act S ( - formula-).
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#63:1> In the second equation, the first term is the outflow of infected

persons from the population due to their developing AIDS; the second term is

the outflow for reasons not related to infection, and the third corresponds

to the individuals from the first equation who are newly infected.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#64:1> The notation used is summarized in table 1.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#65:1> This model corresponds to random mixing when the following two

conditions hold: 1 ) there is random or " proportional" partner choice in

each social setting and 2) the fraction of group I 's contacts that are in any

given social setting K is the same for all K.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#66:1> Condition I corresponds mathematically to the following equation

( terms are defined in table 1):</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#67:1> - insert formula here-</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#68:1> In this formula,</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#69:1> - insert formula here-</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#70:1> represents the fraction of all sexual contacts of type s in

setting K that are made by group J.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#71:1> Multiplying this fraction by - formula- represents the assumption

that this same fraction gives the fraction of group l S type S, setting K

contacts that are with members of group J.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#72:1> In the " random" mixing scenario we present here, - insert formulae

here-.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#73:1> Mixing will be called " structured" when population subgroups

have different functions for their contacts in different social settings, but

within any social setting the mixing I5 consistent with equation 2.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#74:1> In the structured mixing scenarios considered in this paper, - insert

formulae here-.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#75:1> Mixing will be called " selective" when each population subgroup

has the same fraction of its contacts in each social setting, but within each

social setting, mixing is determined by equation 3 below instead of equation

2.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#76:1> Mixing will be called " combined structured and selective" when

subgroups do not make equal proportions of their contacts in different social

settings and within each social setting mixing is determined by equation

3.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#77:1> <h> SELECTIVE MIXING </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#78:1> The following formulation of selective mixing is intended to

supplant our previously published, less manageable formulation of selective

mixing ( 1).
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#79:1> The basic parameters of selectiveness in our model are the number of

social encounters per unit of time that an individual in group I makes in

social setting K that have the potential to become sexual partners of type -

formula- and the probability that such encounters with specific types of

partners J result in sex of type S ( Q,I,J,S,K).
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#80:1> These Q parameters represent the selectiveness with which individuals

act on the T parameters or their opportunities for sex.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#81:1> For simplification, let us consider the situation for one type of

sex within one social setting, so that we can drop the S and K subscripts.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#82:1> Now let-insert formula-where the meaning of the terms is summarized

in table 1.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#83:1> In equation 3,-insert formula-represents the proportion of potential

sexual encounters that are due to group j.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#84:1> Multiplying this fraction by T, NI essentially assumes that the

social mixing leading to sexual proposals is proportional ( or random).
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#85:1> Finally, the QIJ factor represents biased rates of rejection of those

potential sexual encounters.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#86:1> Note that the CJ calculated with equation 3 must meet the following

constraint:</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#87:1> - insert formula-</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2A-023#88:1> By substituting from equation 3, we compute - insert

formula-where-insert formula-represents the average proportion of all sexual

opportunities which result in sex by an individual in group i.
<ICE-USA:W2A-023#89:1> If the QIJ 's and CI 's are known, we have shown that the following

iteration procedure for estimating values of TJ 's, based on equation 5, will

always converge to a stationary set of TJ 's that satisfy equation 5:</p> </I>
