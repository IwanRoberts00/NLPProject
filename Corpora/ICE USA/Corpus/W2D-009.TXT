<p> States should start with the assumption that they may use their funds in

innovative ways to achieve the critical goals laid out in the TANF statute.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#2:1> The following steps outline a simple step-by-step process to follow in

determining how to best use the available funds.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#3:1> The first step in the process of deciding how best to use TANF and

MOE funds is to identify needs within the State and prioritize them.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#4:1> This step includes identifying needs, weighing alternative options and

strategies that address these needs ( e.g., for consistency with TANF

purposes and requirements), selecting the most appropriate services and

benefits, and designing programs or activities that reflect those

decisions.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#5:1> If the proposed program or activity achieves a TANF purpose, the

second step involves determining the nature of the benefit.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#6:1> A State may choose to spend funds on activities that are considered "

assistance" under the Federal regulations. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#7:1> NOTE: See pp. 25-26 and á260.31 of TANF rule for additional

information on " assistance." These activities are subject to a variety of

spending limitations and requirements - - including work, time limits, child

support assignment, and data reporting.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#8:1> A State may also choose to fund activities that are not considered "

assistance." These latter activities would not have the same requirements

associated with them.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#9:1> <h> Eligibility </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#10:1> The next step is to define individual eligibility criteria (

which would generally be in the form of income and/or resource standards) for

receipt of benefits.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#11:1> The first and second purposes of TANF concern only " needy families"

or " needy parents," respectively, as defined by State criteria.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#12:1> Thus, a State must establish financial eligibility criteria for

benefits under either of these purposes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#13:1> For the third and fourth purposes, a State may use Federal funds to

provide services to both needy and non-needy families that are consistent

with those purposes. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#14:1> <h> &bullet; Use of Federal or State funds </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#15:1> The State must then decide how to fund the desired program

benefits and services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#16:1> This decision will determine what specific requirements apply and

whether a particular use of funds is appropriate. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#17:1> All State expenditures claimed under the MOE requirements must be

made with respect to " eligible families." These families need not actually

be TANF recipients in order to receive services or benefits funded with MOE

dollars; they need only be financially eligible for the service or benefit (

and have a minor child living with an adult relative in the home).
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#18:1> The definition of " eligible families" is very similar to that of "

needy families"; eligible families are families that meet the income and

resource standards in the State plan.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#19:1> In addition, they must be either: ( 1) eligible for TANF; or ( 2)

eligible for TANF, but for the five-year time limit on federally funded

assistance or the restrictions on benefits to immigrants found in title IV of

the 1996 welfare law ( Public Law 104-193). </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#20:1> In addition, the State may count as MOE only the qualified

expenditures that exceed its program spending in 1995.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#21:1> This limitation is referred to as the " new spending test."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#22:1> A State may expend Federal funds, but not State MOE funds, for

activities that were previously authorized under its IV-A or IV-F plans, but

which are not otherwise allowable under TANF ( including juvenile justice

and/or State foster care maintenance payments).</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#23:1> <h> &bullet; General limitations </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#24:1> The final step in determining how best to use the available TANF

funds is to determine what requirements, limitations, and restrictions apply

to the selected activities or services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#25:1> The last two sections of this guide outline the statutory

requirements, restrictions and cost principles that apply.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#26:1> For example, they address the requirements associated with "

assistance"for certain clients, the administrative cost caps, the medical

services prohibition, and general appropriations principles.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#27:1> Specific questions on these limitations can be directed to the ACF

Regional Offices for clarification. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#28:1> <h> Federal TANF Funds</h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#29:1> <h> &bullet; Flexibility to meet program goals </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#30:1> The TANF program gives States broad flexibility to make program

and funding decisions that they believe will best support the goals of the

program and their individual circumstances.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#31:1> They may use Federal funds for a wide array of services and benefits

that were previously allowable only through specific, categorical programs.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#32:1> States should view their Federal TANF grant as a source of funds that

they may use creatively to support work and the efforts of low-income working

families, promote marriage, and reduce and prevent out-of-wedlock

childbearing.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#33:1> In support of these goals, they may use their funds to fill gaps in

the service delivery system, integrate program services, and supplement or

enhance the services available through other programs. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#34:1> <h> Key features of the TANF program include:</h>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#35:1> <h> &bullet; Ability to tailor services </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#36:1> Under the prior public assistance program, all families in

similar circumstances of need were entitled to a standard package of basic

benefits and services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#37:1> Under TANF, States have the ability to offer services to some, but

not all, families and to tailor services and benefits so that they better

address the needs of individual clients.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#38:1> They also have the ability to make adjustments in the services they

offer, depending upon funding availability and other factors.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#39:1> However, under their TANF State plans, States must set forth the

objective criteria for the determination of eligibility and the delivery of

benefits and for the fair and equitable treatment of clients.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#40:1> <h> &bullet; State discretion about eligibility </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#41:1> States may set different financial eligibility criteria for

different types of benefits in order to increase the number of families they

help to become self-sufficient.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#42:1> For example, States may set higher income standards to establish

eligibility for transitional benefits ( i.e., for those no longer receiving

cash assistance) in order to provide these families child care,

transportation, and other job retention and advancement services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#43:1> For instance, States may limit eligibility for TANF cash assistance

to families with income below poverty, while making transitional child care

and transportation services available to families with incomes up to 185&percent; of

the poverty line.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#44:1> By adopting these different standards, States may provide work

supports to a broader range of low-income, working families.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#45:1> Under this principle, a State can set different financial

eligibility criteria based on any number of categorical distinctions.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#46:1> For example, as we indicated above, States may apply different

standards for " assistance" than for other types of benefits or services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#47:1> Also, where appropriate, a State may deem specific groups financially

eligible for particular services if there is a categorical, factual basis (

for example, homelessness) for determining financial need. </p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#48:1> <h> &bullet; Continuation of waiver policies </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#49:1> A State that had a welfare reform waiver(s) approved before

enactment of PRWORA may continue to operate its program under some or all of

those waivers rather than the TANF rules.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#50:1> For States that elect this option, the provisions or requirements of

TANF that are inconsistent with the waiver are not effective until the

applicable waivers expire.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#51:1> <h> &bullet; Limited Federal rules </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#52:1> Under TANF, the Federal government may not regulate State conduct

or enforce any provision except to the extent expressly provided by law.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#53:1> Consistent with the principle of State flexibility in program design,

the final TANF rules regulate only where Congress specifically directed the

Department of Health and Human Services to do so or where the Department is

charged with enforcing penalties.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#54:1> <h> &bullet; Use of Federal TANF funds </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#55:1> State, local, and Tribal TANF agencies, or private organizations

providing services under contract with the TANF agency, may use Federal TANF

funds in one of three fundamental ways:</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#56:1> <h> 1. For the purposes of TANF </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#57:1> Under this provision, allowable expenditures for particular

activities, benefits, or services consist of those that are " in any manner

reasonably calculated to accomplish" any one of the four purposes of the TANF

program.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#58:1> Activities, benefits, or services that are reasonably calculated to

accomplish a TANF purpose are those that directly lead to ( or can be

expected to lead to) achievement of a TANF purpose.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#59:1> This language includes all activities that are obviously related to a

purpose.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#60:1> It also includes activities whose relationship to a purpose may not

be obvious, but for which there is evidence that it achieves a purpose.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#61:1> For example, there is a clear statistical relationship between

staying in school and lower teen pregnancy rates.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#62:1> Thus, we would conclude that special initiatives to keep teens in

school are reasonably related to the third purpose of TANF - to reduce

out-of-wedlock pregnancies. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#63:1> States may use Federal TANF and State MOE funds in accordance

with this principle for a variety of eligible activities.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#64:1> Under this purpose, a State could help any needy parent,

including a noncustodial parent or a working parent, by providing employment,

job preparation, or training services.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#65:1> Examples of potential services include job or career advancement

activities, marriage counseling, refundable earned income tax credits, child

care services, and employment services designed to increase the noncustodial

parent 's ability to pay child support.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#66:1> Activities that promote any one of the three objectives - job

preparation, work, and marriage - - would be consistent with this purpose.

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#67:1> Like a needy family, a needy parent must meet the income and/or

resource standards established by the State in its TANF plan.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#68:1> The following example illustrates how some of the funding

principles would apply in meeting this TANF purpose. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#69:1> A State agency determines that there are insufficient child care

services available for the pre-school age children of working needy parents.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#70:1> A Head Start facility can meet this need.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#71:1> The TANF agency could contract with the Head Start grantee to provide

child care services for a number of TANF families who are not enrolled in

Head Start or to provide expanded hours of child care services for TANF

families whose children are enrolled in the Head Start program. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#72:1> The State agency may pay for these services with Federal TANF or

State MOE funds.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#73:1> ( However, the Head Start grantee must account for the TANF and MOE

funding separately from its Head Start funding and must also be able to

identify the needy or eligible families served with the TANF or MOE

funds.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#74:1> Neither this purpose nor the following purpose ( related to

family formation) is limited to needy families or individuals.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#75:1> Thus, a State may use Federal TANF funds, but not MOE funds, to serve

non-needy families or individuals for either of these two purposes.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#76:1> However, the State must establish objective criteria for the delivery

of services to the non-needy. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#77:1> Potential activities that would be reasonably calculated to

accomplish this purpose include abstinence programs, visiting nurse services,

and programs and services for youth such as counseling, teen pregnancy

prevention campaigns, and after-school programs that provide supervision when

school is not is session.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#78:1> A State may also fund a media campaign for the general population on

abstinence or preventing out-of-wedlock childbearing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#79:1> A significant share of TANF families consists of unmarried

mothers with low skills who live with their children apart from low-skilled,

underemployed fathers.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#80:1> Many of these fathers are involved in the lives of their children and

provide some financial support, but would like to do much more.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#81:1> Historically, however, the fathers have found limited employment

opportunities, and welfare rules have worked to discourage family formation

and fuller involvement of these fathers in the lives of their children. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#82:1> This fourth TANF purpose offers the opportunity to address these

issues.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#83:1> Some activities that are reasonably calculated to accomplish this

purpose might include parenting skills training, premarital and marriage

counseling, and mediation services; activities to promote parental access and

visitation; job placement and training services for noncustodial parents;

initiatives to promote responsible fatherhood and increase the capacity of

fathers to provide emotional and financial support for their children; and

crisis or intervention services.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#84:1> <h> 2.Previously authorized activities </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2D-009#85:1> This statutory provision allows States to use Federal TANF funds

for specific activities that had been previously authorized based on an

approved title IV-A or IV-F plan and using the same eligibility criteria

contained in the approved plan.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#86:1> While the purposes of the TANF program are very broad, some

activities that are not now permissible had been included in a State 's

approved AFDC plan, JOBS plan, or Supportive Services plan as of September

30, 1995 ( or, at State option, as of August 21, 1996).
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#87:1> Examples of such activities are juvenile justice and certain State

child welfare and foster care activities that were included in many States'

approved plans.
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#88:1> A State may continue to provide these services or benefits that were

previously authorized, notwithstanding the prohibitions in PRWORA ( under

section 408 of the Social Security Act).
<ICE-USA:W2D-009#89:1> For example, if a State 's approved AFDC plan as of September 30,

1995, allowed it to assist children in the juvenile justice system, then it

may continue to use TANF funds for such activities even though the child is

not living with a parent or other adult caretaker relative.</p> </I>
