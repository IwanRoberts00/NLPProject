<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#1:1> Twenty-six years ago this week, Walt Disney Co., masquerading as

the Latin- American Development and Management Corp., started buying

thousands of acres of cattle pasture and swamp in Osceola County.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#2:1> Today, Disney is on the verge of building a posh community on

4,000 of those acres that will change Osceola County forever.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#3:1> " It 's an important day for Osceola County and our company,"

Disney Development Vice President Tom Lewis said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#4:1> Lewis would not discuss the plans in detail before the

presentation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#5:1> But more than a dozen elected officials, planners and

business-community leaders who have been in private briefings in the past

three weeks said Disney is aiming to create a modern city of as many as

20,000 residents.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#6:1> Many of those people declined to be identified because of their

relationship with Disney or because they did not want to speak publicly about

the plans before today 's meeting.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#7:1> They said those plans call for the largest shopping mall in

Central Florida, office buildings and 8,400 residences, including 3,450

high-priced, single-family homes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#8:1> The plans also include golf courses, an 800-room hotel, a

transportation station, a hospital, schools and institutes celebrating " the

pioneering ingenuity of free enterprise," the officials and community leaders

said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#9:1> Plenty has changed from the original concept announced amid much

fanfare in March 1990.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#10:1> Disney has reduced the size of the office parks and increased the

number of homes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#11:1> Lewis said Disney 's first foray into the regional planning

process is taking longer than he anticipated.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#12:1> But he said the delays aren't abnormal for a project of that scope.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#13:1> " We're not talking about puttin 'rep one 200,000- square-foot office

building or a 300-room Holiday Inn here," Lewis said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#14:1> Disney would like to begin building the first phase of the

project, a 200,000-square-foot office building, later this year. The

building, which is being designed by renowned Italian architect Aldo Rossi,

would be Osceola County 's second-largest structure.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#15:1> The Osceola Square Mall is the largest.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#16:1> And that 's just an appetizer.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#17:1> Seven and a half of those office buildings would fit inside the big

project, a regional shopping mall.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#18:1> The current timetable calls for the mall 's completion in late

1993 or early 1994, Todd Mansfield of Disney Development Co.said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#19:1> Building the mall won't be a problem, Mansfield said; finding

financially healthy anchor tenants will.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#20:1> " With the retail center, the timetable is not entirely in Disney 's

court," Mansfield said. " It is a tough time in the retail market.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#21:1> But we are quite optimistic that this is an unusually attractive

retailing opportunity."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#22:1> No stores will be announced today, Mansfield said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#23:1> Dan Barry, a retail analyst with the New York brokerage firm of

Kidder Peabody, said that despite upheaval in the retailing industry, several

chains have strong balance sheets and could anchor the mall.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#24:1> More than a year ago, Disney officials said they were talking

with retail blue bloods such as Nordstrom Inc.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#25:1> of Seattle, Harrod 's of London and Macy of New York.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#26:1> A Disney source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed

that talks with all three retailers are progressing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#27:1> All would be logical choices for Disney, especially Nordstrom,

Barry said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#28:1> The Seattle retailer " is one of the few companies that 's

nationally known," Barry said, and, though many of its stores are on the West

Coast, " they wouldn't have a problem expanding into Florida."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#29:1> Mansfield said he also is talking with stores " prominent in the

Florida market" and chains based in France and Japan.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#30:1> The moderate-to-upscale anchor stores fit right in with the

company 's plans for high-priced, golf-course, estate homes.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#31:1> " They mentioned housing with a Key West theme," said Cliff

Guillet, executive director of the East Central Florida Regional Planning

Council, who saw the plans two weeks ago.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#32:1> Sources said Disney has no provisions for more affordable housing

on the Osceola property.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#33:1> But that doesn't mean lower-priced housing is a dead issue.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#34:1> Osceola County officials said talks with Disney include the

company making a " substantive, seven-figure" contribution to create a

revolving, affordable loan fund for low-income and first-time home

buyers.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#35:1> " The economics of putting affordable housing out there on some

of the most valuable land around doesn't make a lot of sense," one Osceola

County official said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#36:1> " But that doesn't mean they shouldn't have an obligation to help

build it somewhere else."<ICE-USA:W2C-001#>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#37:1> Today 's presentation will mark several " firsts" in the

Disney-Osceola County relationship.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#38:1> Any construction will be the first in Osceola County; all of its

theme parks and hotels are in Orange County.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#39:1> The project marks the first time Disney has agreed to follow the same

rules as other developers.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#40:1> Disney plans have been exempt from *local* review since 1967, when

the state created the autonomous Reedy Creek Improvement District.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#41:1> Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the presentation is why it 's

happening at all.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#42:1> The unveiling is being made at Osceola County commissioners'

request to help dampen some opposition to the proposed 11-mile western

extension of Dart Boulevard in northern Osceola County.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#43:1> Critics of the extension, including business owners on West U.S.

192, want some assurances that the county won't be building a direct route to

Disney World that could bypass many businesses.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#44:1> Other critics, including some county officials, also believe

Disney should pay more toward the public-private partnership proposed to

finance the

&dollar;97 million toll road from Florida 's Turnpike to World Drive.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#45:1> Les Haskew, executive director of the Kissimmee/Osceola County

Chamber of Commerce, said his group hasn't taken an official position on the

Dart extension yet.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#46:1> " We are very concerned about ( U.S.) 192," Haskew said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#47:1> " And we're very concerned 'reat this isn't going to create a straight

shot to Disney World and then they don't build anything to expand our tax

base in Osceola."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#48:1> Slated to open in conjunction with the Orlando beltway 's Southern

Connector extension in 1994, Dart is an integral piece of the Disney road

network.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#49:1> Because the Dart deal is vital to Disney 's expansion plans for

the next 30 years, Lewis said he is ready to put the Osceola County project

on the table now.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#50:1> Disney has agreed to contribute

&dollar;1.5 million a year to the county for the 22-year life of the bonds that will

pay for the extension, plus have Reedy Creek underwrite the bond issue.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#51:1> Commissioner Larry Whaley thinks Disney will get a lot more out

of the Dart deal than the substantial amount it is already committed to put

into it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#52:1> " They ( Disney) keep telling us about how much they're going to

 're up," Whaley said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#53:1> " But what they aren't saying is that a lot of that is going to be

repaid after the road turns a profit.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#54:1> They need to understand - and I'm sure they do un 'mrstand - what

value they are going to get out of it, too."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#55:1> Some longtime Osceola County residents doubt that Disney is ready

to build.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#56:1> They say they won't believe it until they see shovels turning

dirt.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#57:1> Walt Disney 's original vision for a futuristic city called EPCOT

- Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow - and a small airport were on

the company 's original maps where the mall is now to be built.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#58:1> In the early 1980s, as Epcot Center - the theme park - was nearing

completion, the company announced plans for a hotel and shopping village in

Osceola County just like the Disney Shopping Village at Lake Buena Vista in

Orange County.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#59:1> Both concepts died without a whimper.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#60:1> " They've blown plen 'veof smoke before," Whaley said.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#61:1> " I tend to believe it 's going to happen this time.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#62:1> But I also understand why some folks are skeptical."</p>

report.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#64:1> Disney Development Co.officials are to unveil plans to develop a

city of about 20,000 in Osceola County at 10 a.m. today before the Osceola

County Commission.</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#65:2> <H> HOLE IN YARD TURNS INTO MOUNTAIN OF PROBLEMS</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#66:2> Nobody wanted to see it turn out this way for the old man.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#67:2> They all say so now.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#68:2> Orange County officials didn't think they'd have to p 'dce

74-year-old Omer St.Pierre in handcuffs or take him to the mental health

crisis center.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#69:2> They didn't think his elderly wife would develop chest pains and

they would have to call an ambulance.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#70:2> They didn't even know they would cost him nearly 30 percent of his

yearly income.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#71:2> But rules are rules, and the old man didn't follow them.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#72:2> Omer St. Pierre didn't clean up his yard.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#73:2> Instead, the eccentric French Canadian kept collecting.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#74:2> In a deep hole beside his Orlo Vista home, he layered refrigerators,

shopping carts, clothes, two car engines, books and heaven knows what else.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#75:2> He covered the hole with boards.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#76:2> " I pleaded with him to clean the property," said Benny Roberts,

the county 's chief code enforcement officer.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#77:2> When he didn't, the county hired a contractor with a big scoop

and a tractor-trailer to haul the stuff away.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#78:2> " It was just - just junk," said Hoke Dorough, code enforcement

officer.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#79:2> But not to St. Pierre.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#80:2> It is hard to grasp the logic of an old man who carts home dozens

of dead Christmas trees.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#81:2> What use are they? Why would he want such stuff?

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#82:2> The answer is that having the trees isn't the point.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#83:2> Collecting them is.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#84:2> Collecting fills his time.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#85:2> St. Pierre brings home bags of shoes, for instance, and sits

placidly sorting them on the porch of his cement block and tin roof house.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#86:2> He 's done that since he built the place in 1960.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#87:2> So he doesn't take it kindly when the county describes his things

as junk.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#88:2> After all, no one likes to think his labor has been for naught.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#89:2> And perhaps there is yet another twist here.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#90:2> Perhaps worn-out shoes look valuable when your income is less

than

&dollar;4,500 a year.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#91:2> Maybe you want a small stock of refrigerators in case yours quits.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#92:2> Maybe the bags of clothes are a kind of imagined insurance against

poverty.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#93:2> St. Pierre 's next-door neighbor, A.J. Rowe, said St. Pierre gives

away many of the things he collects.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#94:2> " He thinks he 's helping people," Rowe said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#95:2> St. Pierre was still hauling things by his neighbors' small block

houses and sparse yards - some of them also littered with trash - when one of

them complained.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#96:2> Rowe said he can't understand the complaint.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#97:2> " What gripes me is that I was here and he was here before any

other houses.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#98:2> He 's been doing this for 40-some years.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#99:2> That hole is not an eyesore," Rowe said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#100:2> Code officer Dorough said he didn't even see the hole during his

first visit in August until he walked up on it.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#101:2> " What I saw blew my mind.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#102:2> I told him he needs to clean up the property and stop bringing

things home that way," Dorough said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#103:2> " He kept mentioning somebody with a truck who was going to take

things away - that 's the best I could understand him.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#104:2> He kept putting me off."</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#105:2> Did Dorough ever think of getting a French translator?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#106:2> " No.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#107:2> He understands.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#108:2> Sometimes I don't think he 's got all his oars in the water, but I

can communicate with the old man," Dorough said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#109:2> St. Pierre said someone from the county came out several times

and talked to his wife, Elaine, while he was in Jacksonville having a hernia

operation.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#110:2> She told him she thought the county was going to take away their

house and repeated the word " lien" a lot.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#111:2> Then they got two letters about something called a public

hearing.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#112:2> Did St. Pierre understand the meaning of public hearing?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#113:2> " Little bit.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#114:2> Who is there? What happens?</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#115:2> " They ask questions.? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#116:2> St. Pierre doesn't always understand the questions, and he often

doesn't want to answer when he does, so he didn't go.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#117:2> The county 's code board took its vote: If Omer St.Pierre

wouldn't clean up his property, then the county should hire someone to do it

and bill him.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#118:2> If he didn't pay, the county would place a lien against his house

and collect when it was sold.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#119:2> Contractors rolled onto St. Pierre 's property on March 4,

knocked over the shed containing his library, and scooped up the remains.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#120:2> " I have 600 French books.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#121:2> Now I got nothing more to read," he said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#122:2> He said they hauled away a brand-new 1960 Buick motor in a

crate, a riding lawn mower and a big pile of dirt he planned to use to level

his lot.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#123:2> St. Pierre was beside himself.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#124:2> A report by the Orange County Sheriff 's Office says he stood on his

porch at 6505 Chantry St. and cranked off a couple of rounds from his

shotgun.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#125:2> St. Pierre says he never fired.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#126:2> " When blood leaks and you'v 'veot a hole in your head, that 's

what counts," St. Pierre said.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#127:2> Deputies wrote that they heard St.Pierre screaming gibberish

from the porch of his residence.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#128:2> His tone was very angry, the report said, but " The words were

unintelligible.<ICE-USA:W2C-001#> That 's because he was yelling in French.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#129:2> The deputies surrounded the house.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#130:2> Then St. Pierre seemed to calm down, so they walked up.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2C-001#131:2> St. Pierre said, " Three, four police.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#132:2> We all talking nice. They know I wasn't doing no harm.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#133:2> They told me so.
<ICE-USA:W2C-001#134:2> They look all over my house."</p> </I>
