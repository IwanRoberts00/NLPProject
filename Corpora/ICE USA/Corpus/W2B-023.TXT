<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#1:1> The molecule was not alive, at least not in any conventional

sense.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#2:1> Yet its behavior was astonishingly lifelike.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#3:1> When it appeared last April at the Scripps Research Institute in La

Jolla, California, scientists thought it had spoiled their experiment.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#4:1> But this snippet of synthetic RNA-- one of the master molecules in the

nuclei of all cells--proved unusually talented.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#5:1> Within an hour of its formation, it had commandeered the organic

material in a thimble-size test tube and started to make copies of itself.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#6:1> Then the copies made copies.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#7:1> Before long, the copies began to evolve, developing the ability to

perform new and unexpected chemical tricks.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#8:1> Surprised and excited, the scientists who witnessed the event found

themselves wondering, Is <it> this </it> how life got started? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#9:1> It is a question that is being asked again and again as news of

this remarkable molecule and others like it spreads through the scientific

world.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#10:1> Never before have the creations of laboratories come so close to

crossing the threshold that separates living from nonliving, the quick from

the dead.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#11:1> It is as if the most fundamental questions about who we are and how

we got here are being distilled into threadlike entities smaller than specks

of dust.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#12:1> In the flurry of research now underway--and the philosophical debate

that is certain to follow--scientists find themselves confronting anew one of

earth 's most ancient mysteries.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#13:1> What, exactly, is life, and how did it get started? </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#14:1> Science 's answers to these questions are changing, and changing

rapidly, as fresh evidence pours in from fields as disparate as oceanography

and molecular biology, geochemistry and astronomy.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#15:1> This summer a startling, if still sketchy, synthesis of the new ideas

emerged during a weeklong meeting of origin-of-life researchers in Barcelona,

Spain.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#16:1> Life, it now appears, did not dawdle at the starting gate, but rushed

forth at full gallop.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#17:1> UCLA paleobiologist J. William Schopf reported finding fossilized

imprints of a thriving microbial community sandwiched between layers of rock

that is 3.5 billion years old.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#18:1> This, along with other evidence, shows that life was well established

only a billion years after the earth 's formation, a much faster evolution

than previously thought.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#19:1> Life did not arise under calm, benign conditions, as once assumed,

but under the hellish skies of a planet racked by volcanic eruptions and

menaced by comets and asteroids.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#20:1> In fact, the intruders from outer space may have delivered the raw

materials necessary for life.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#21:1> So robust were the forces that gave rise to the first living

organisms that it is entirely possible, many researchers believe, that life

began not once but several times before it finally " took" and colonized the

planet.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> The notion that life arose quickly and easily has spurred

scientists to attempt a truly presumptuous feat: they want to create

life--real life--in the lab.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#22:1> What they have in mind is not some monster like Frankenstein 's,

pieced together from body parts and jolted into consciousness by lightning

bolts, but something more like the molecule in that thimble-size test tube at

the Scripps Research Institute.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#23:1> They want to turn the hands of time all the way back to the beginning

and create an entity that approximates the first, most primitive living

thing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#24:1> This ancient ancestor, believes Gerald Joyce, whose laboratory came

up with the Scripps molecule, may have been a simpler sturdier precursor of

modern RNA, which, along with the nucleic acid DNA, its chemical cousin,

carries the genetic code in all creatures great and small.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> Some

such molecule, Joyce and other scientists believe, arose in the shadowy

twilight zone where the distinction between living and nonliving blurs and

finally disappears.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#25:1> The precise chemical wizardry that caused it to pass from one side to

the other remains unknown.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#26:1> But scientists around the world are feverishly trying to duplicate

it.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#27:1> Eventually, possibly before the end of the century, Joyce predicts,

one or more of them will succeed in creating a " living" molecule.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#28:1> When they do, it will throw into sharp relief one of the most

unsettling questions of all: Was life an improbable miracle that happened

only once?
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#29:1> Or is it the result of a chemical process so common and inevitable

that life may be continually springing up throughout the universe?</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#>

Of all the riddles that have stirred the human imagination, none has provoked

more lyrical speculation, more religious awe, more contentious debate.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#30:1> No other moment in time, aside from the Big Bang that began the

universe, could be more central to the understanding of nature than the

instant that life began.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#31:1> " Scientific" theories on the subject are as old as civilization.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#32:1> The ancient Egyptians believed frogs and toads arose from silt

deposited by the flooding Nile.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#33:1> The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that insects and worms were

born of dewdrops and slime, that mice were generated by dank soil and that

eels and fish sprang forth from sand, mud and putrefying algae.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#34:1> In the 19th century, electricity, magnetism and radiation were

believed to have the ability to quicken nonliving matter.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> It took

the conceptual might of Charles Darwin to imagine a biologically plausible

scenario for life 's emergence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#35:1> In an oft quoted letter, written in 1871, Darwin suggested that life

arose in a " warm little pond" where a rich brew of organic chemicals, over

eons of time, might have given rise to the first simple organisms.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#36:1> For the next century, Darwin 's agreeable hypothesis, expanded upon by

other theorists, dominated thinking on the subject.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#37:1> Researchers decided that the " pond" was really the ocean and began

trying to figure out where the building blocks of life could have come

from.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#38:1> In 1953 University of Chicago graduate student Stanley Miller

provided the first widely accepted experimental evidence.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#39:1> In a glass jar he created a comic-strip version of primitive earth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#40:1> Water for the ocean.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#41:1> Methane, ammonia and hydrogen for the atmosphere.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#42:1> Sparks for lightning and other forms of electrical discharge.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#43:1> One week later he found in his jar a sticky goop of organic

chemicals, including large quantities of amino acids, Lego blocks for the

proteins that make up cells.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#44:1> Case closed, or nearly so, many scientists believed.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> Now

this textbook picture of how life originated, so familiar to college students

just a generation ago, is under serious attack.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#45:1> New insights into planetary formation have made it increasingly

doubtful that clouds of methane and ammonia ever dominated the atmosphere of

primitive earth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#46:1> And although Miller 's famous experiment produced the components of

proteins, more and more researchers believe that a genetic master

molecule--probably RNA--arose before proteins did.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> Meanwhile, older

and older fossils have all but proved that life did not evolve at the

leisurely pace Darwin envisioned.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#47:1> Perhaps most intriguing of all, the discovery of organisms living in

oceanic hot springs has provided a Stygian alternative to Darwin 's peaceful

picture.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#48:1> Life, says microbiologist Karl Stetter of the University of

Regensburg in Germany, may not have formed in a nice, warm pond, but in " a

hot pressure cooker."</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> If scientists have, by and large, tossed out

the old ideas, they have not yet reached a consensus on the new.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#49:1> The current version of the story of life is a complex tale with many

solid facts, many holes and no shortage of competing theories on how to fill

in the missing pieces.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#50:1> <h> ONCE UPON A TIME </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#51:1> Some 4.5 billion years ago, the solar system took shape inside a

chrysalis of gas and dust.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#52:1> Small objects formed first, then slammed into one another to create

the planets.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#53:1> Early on, the energy unleashed by these violent collisions turned the

embryonic earth into a molten ball.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#54:1> For a billion years thereafter, the young planet 's gravitational

field attracted all sorts of celestial garbage.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#55:1> Icy comets screamed in from the outermost reaches of the solar

system, while asteroids and meteorites spiraled down like megaton

bombs.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> Some of these asteroids could have been the size of

present-day continents, says planetary scientist Christopher Chyba, a White

House fellow, and the asteroids' impact would have generated sufficient heat

to vaporize rock, boil the oceans and fling into the atmosphere a scalding

shroud of steam.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#56:1> Such a cataclysm would have obliterated all living things.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#>

Yet after a billion years, when the solar system was swept nearly clean and

the primordial bombardment ended, life was already flourishing.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#57:1> UCLA 's Schopf has identified the imprints of 11 different types of

microorganisms in the 3.5 billion-year-old rocks of Western Australia.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#58:1> Many of the fossils closely resemble species of blue-green algae

found all over the world today.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#59:1> Still older rocks in Greenland hint of cellular life that may have

come into existence a few hundred million years earlier--perhaps 3.8 billion

years ago.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#60:1> At that time, scientists believe, life-threatening asteroids were

still periodically pummeling the planet.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#61:1> Verne Oberbeck and colleagues at NASA Ames Research Center estimate

that the interval between major impacts could have been as short as 3 million

to 6 million years--much too brief a time to give life a leisurely

incubation.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#62:1> This means, says Oberbeck, that the chemistry needed to green the

planet must have been fast, and it must have been simple.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#63:1> That being the case, he asks, why wouldn't life have arisen more than

once? </p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#64:1> <h> THE POINT OF ORIGIN </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#65:1> Where could life have sprouted and still been relatively safe

from all but the largest asteroids? For the answer, many researchers are

looking to strange, chimney-like structures found in the depths of oceans.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#66:1> These sit atop cracks in the ocean floor, known as hydrothermal

vents, that lead to subterranean chambers of molten rock.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#67:1> The result is an underwater geyser: cold water plunges down through

some of the cracks, and hot water gushes out through others.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#68:1> Fifteen years ago, when scientists began using submarines to explore

these seemly hostile environments, they were startled to discover extensive

ecosystem filled with strange organisms, including giant tube worms and blind

shrimp.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#69:1> Even more interesting, according to analysis or their RNA, the

sulfur-eating microorganisms that anchor the food chain around the vents are

the closest living link to the first creatures on earth.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#70:1> The only other life-forms that archaic are microbes living in surface

steam baths like Yellowstone 's Octopus Spring.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> Could these

overheated spots have been the places where life on earth got started? This "

hot world" hypothesis has won many converts.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#71:1> Norman Pace, a microbiologist at Indiana University, speculates that

the thin crust of primitive earth, as prone to cracking as an eggshell, would

have made hydrothermal vents far more common than they are today.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#72:1> Geochemist Everett Shock of Washington University calculates that at

high temperatures organisms can get extra energy from nutrients.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#73:1> " The hotter it is," says Shock, " the easier life is."
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#74:1> ( Up to a point.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#75:1> No one has yet found a microbe living in conditions hotter than

235&degree;F.)</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#76:1> Still, the question remains: Did life originate in the vents, or

just migrate there?
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#77:1> The vents may not have been a cradle but an air-raid shelter for

organisms that originated near the ocean surface, than drifted to the bottom.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#78:1> There, protected by thousands of feet of water, these lucky refugees

might have survived a series of extraterrestrial impacts that killed off

their relatives near the sunlit surface.</p>
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#79:1> <h> THE INGREDIENTS </h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#80:1> Stanley Miller 's glass-jar experiment 40 years ago suggested that

the components of life were easily manufactured from gases in the atmosphere.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#81:1> The conditions he re-created in his laboratory faithfully reflected

the prevailing wisdom of the time, which held that the earth was formed by a

gradual, almost gentle convergence of rock and flecks of dust under the

influence of gravity.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#82:1> According to this model, the earth started out cold.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#83:1> Its deepest layers did not catch fire until much later, after the

decay of radioactive elements slowly turned up the thermostat in the core.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#84:1> Thus, heavy elements such as iron did not immediately melt and sink

to the core, but remained close to the surface for hundreds of millions of

years.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> Why is this important?
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#85:1> Because iron soaks up oxygen and prevents it from combining with

carbon to form carbon dioxide.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#86:1> Instead, the carbon, and also the nitrogen, spewed into the

atmosphere by ancient volcanoes would have been available to interact with

hydrogen.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#87:1> The serendipitous result: formation of methane and ammonia, the gases

that made the Miller experiment go.</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2B-023#88:1> It was, says Chyba, " a beautiful picture."
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#89:1> Unfortunately, he adds, it is probably wrong.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#90:1> For the violent collisions now believed to have attended earth 's

birth would have melted the iron and sent it plummeting to the depths.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#91:1> As a result, the early atmosphere would have been composed largely of

carbon dioxide-and organic compounds cannot be so easily generated in the

presence of CO2.</p><p><ICE-USA:W2B-023#> Where, then, did the building blocks of life come

from?
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#92:1> Quite possibly, many scientists think, organic compounds were

transported to earth by the very comets, asteroids and meteorites that were

making life so difficult.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#93:1> At the University of California at Davis, zoologist David Deamer has

extracted from meteorites organic material that forms cell- like membranes.
<ICE-USA:W2B-023#94:1> He has also isolated pale yellow pigments capable of absorbing energy

from light--a precursor, Deamer believes, of chlorophyll, the green pigment

used by modern plants.</p> </I> пя
