<ICE-USA:W2F-019#2:1> <h> By E. McGrand</h>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#3:1> The dilemma was whether to take the train or the bus.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#4:1> Her bag was too heavy, she realized that several blocks after she left

the house.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#5:1> The bus would smell awful, and she would get motion sick, and the bag

would have to be stowed in the stomach at the side of the bus so she would

have to rummage through it and dig out all the things she might possibly want

and put them in a plastic which sooner or later would tear and then all the

small sharp things would spill out and get lost in her clothes and seat and

jab her suddenly, and at least one bottle or jar of something that could come

undone would.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#6:1> But the bus was cheaper.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#7:1> However, it was slower. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#8:1> The train would be fast, and clean, and she probably wouldn't get

motion sick and could move around if she did, and entertain herself on the

observation car or in the lounge car if she could eat or drink.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#9:1> There would be the odd compact little bathroom just small enough to

make sure everything got wet when water splashed out of the tiny wash basin,

and the crumbly crackers and sharp processed cheese she would buy for herself

in lieu of more expensive lunch offerings, and the dinner, with its paper and

plastic fantaglia, and the overall nostalgia, elegant sentimental aura of

trains - - legacy of hundreds of crowded, lively trains in 1940 's movies, and

sleek, satin and clever talk and porter trains of 1930 's movies, and the

trains of novels and short stories.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#10:1> But the train was more expensive.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#11:1> Almost as expensive as the plane which was unthinkable. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#12:1> The bag was too heavy to keep carrying and too heavy to keep

guarding.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#13:1> Saving money was always a good plan.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#14:1> But it would be nice to have money when she got there, enough to

casually treat him, take his sister to the toy store and buy her something

frivolous and charming, take his mother to lunch, assert, somehow, that

though she was the guest, and though she was being looked over, and though

they were putting her up and feeding her, and though she wasn't from an old

or famous family, and though she couldn't smooth the edges of things with the

gleamy patina of money F. Scott Fitzgerald described with the exactness and

tenderness of infatuation, still, she could be polite and take bloody care of

herself and pay back their offerings so no one, no one would think she owed

them any god-damned thing or snub her with it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#15:1> But arriving later.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#16:1> And disheveled, and quite probably motion sick.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#17:1> Well, she was Irish.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#18:1> She'd lo 'd interesting pale - - the elaborate bone structure must be

good for something.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#19:1> What if something happened.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#20:1> She could get him a present.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#21:1> She took the bus.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#22:1> She loved getting him presents. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#23:1> When she was a child, people around her bought each other

presents.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#24:1> She read about it in books, how one shopped for hours or suddenly

came upon it, the present.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#25:1> A sudden perfect repository of the complex yes 's and no 's, a delicate

chimera of the sweeps and glitters and smooth curves of unimaginable,

too-quick-in-motion returned affection, the richness of that lushly

unpredictable exchange, unchanneled by the awful, usual grooves of

defensiveness, dullness, distance and not closeness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#26:1> She never got to get anyone presents - - her siblings were cold and

unaffectionate and uninterested in her, and her mother made a fetish out of

disliking her choices and her father was too shy and distant, made too

uncomfortable by gifts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#27:1> And she had no friends back then, no close friends, certainly no one

like the friends she read about in books.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#28:1> She got occasional duty gifts for people, those surface nods to the

conventions of days when one bought things, but such exchanges were without

joy.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#29:1> The few times she had thought she might be in the middle of a real

present, the person turned out to be only being polite, or not want to

embarrass her but she hangs on and no one likes her, or the recipient was - -

and she'd 'down it all along but pretended for a little out of loneliness - -

not the right angle to her to understand gifts.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#30:1> The offering of good will and companionship is generous - - something

she recognized more as a glimpse into some life or order she had lost but

which was the final thing humans were meant to attain.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#31:1> But however kindly meant, and generously given, seen from the wrong

angle a soul is one-dimensional and flat, and a flat soul is a flat soul is a

flat soul is a flat soul like Gertrude Stein 's rose; itself, the cliche,

endlessly and unavoidably the cliche in the context of the hot-press plastic

mold that makes each part of the conversation just exactly what one would

expect it to be based on what one was told on T.V., radio, the movies,

magazines, newspapers, it ought to be. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#32:1> Then the move out of the nervous town haunted by her implacable

difference from everyone else.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#33:1> And finally, conversations she couldn't predict in a context of

shared interests when no one involved was uneasy about her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#34:1> People who liked to talk about books, art, ideas not automatically

required to be certified by The Group as acceptable before they could be

articulated.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#35:1> And then the lover.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#36:1> And then, oh, the presents.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#37:1> The glorious texture surely he, whose hands could return in such awe

to her skin, whose eyes so beautifully changed the color of a shirt from dull

to an extraordinary variation on blue, surely he would recognize. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#38:1> Exchanging in a language not a language but light illuminating

and triggering the locks on doors to rooms she hadn't thought of, the

shorthand for how beautiful a shiny surface could be, how like his eyes the

colors swirling through the rock were, how much a miracle it was that an

agate could hold in just its shapes and cloudings exactly the sensation of

one of those summer storms which so exactly corresponded to the feeling just

before joining in lovemaking, that demi-second of looking in the lover 's eyes

and knowing you are just about to do something together that will be of all

worlds simultaneously and yes, yes come in and he is coming in and there is

another human being inside of me it is he of the beautiful unexpected eyes

and his hands I cannot predict and he is saying something lovely, yes, and

kissing my cheekbone that way of his, and now it is happening, this thing I

have read of and wanted and not quite believed could really occur ( two

people would never risk themselves with each other this way); the sad,

intimate, richly colored swirls of stone, and eyes, and just before.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#39:1> The presents, finally, the giving of real presents and one quickened

enough to know them.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#40:1> She took the bus. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#41:1> It arrived even later than the tiresome timetable and there was

no one waiting.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#42:1> She had looked forward to someone waiting - - it was another thing,

like the presents, she' 'dread about and lived among but never gotten to have,

someone waiting for her, someone real, waiting for really-her, not their

fantasy of 'I'm a 'mgnificant guy now because I saw this woman who looks

impressively like the important-young-man-appeal magazine ads and I conquered

her, I, and now the pictures in the magazine are like me and everyone will

look at me and think I, too, am an important young man.'
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#43:1> No, he talked to really her, real time, exactly her and liked her

because he hadn't extravagantly at first, just a little, a promising amount.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#44:1> And they' 'dtalked, and played together, and the liking grew, fed on

real things exactly corresponding, not his imagined versions of what he was

told would make him important.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#45:1> And he was going to be waiting, scrunched in his silly car looking a

little shy and then excited to see her and they would snicker a little at the

extravagance and visibility of it all, but it would be lovely and he would be

waiting and there would be a little privacy before the sizing up and the

family and the intrusion of people she didn't know most likely expecting

something from her, which always set her back up which would necessitate the

elaborate smoothing down of patience over the top of her conversation and

response.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#46:1> Only no one was there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#47:1> And when she called, no one answered. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#48:1> They had agreed, two weeks ago, that she would come down to visit

him, had set the day she would leave, the probable time she would arrive.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#49:1> She had called, and left a message on his answering machine at the

apartment in the city.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#50:1> And she had, shyly, called the number of the island that he' 'dwritten

down for her on a scrap of paper from the jumble on his desk, and a woman had

answered, and in a terrible shyness lest this was the mother and she would be

meant to say something to her only she didn't know her and wanted to be left

alone, she' 'dsaid in few words her name, and the bus she was on, and when it

was arriving.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#51:1> But no one was there.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#52:1> Perhaps she was meant to go to his house.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#53:1> But she didn't know where it was.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#54:1> She could take a taxi - - thanks be she had not taken the train so

she had money.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#55:1> But had they expected her to take a taxi?
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#56:1> She called her machine in her apartment in the city, and the machine

responded with nothing, no response.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#57:1> She waited.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#58:1> Maybe he had meant to meet her and they told him the bus would be

late so he stepped out somewhere, yes, that was just the sort of thing he

would do and she could go walk around a little and look for a book store,

where most likely she would have been and most likely he would be, except

that her bag was too heavy, too heavy to carry and too heavy to leave

unguarded.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#59:1> So she reached into the plastic that had, indeed, split for a novel

and sat down to read it. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#60:1> It was a good novel.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#61:1> She always made a point of bringing something good and not too

demanding that she might not ordinarily let herself waste time reading when

she traveled.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#62:1> She hadn't finished it, or even begun it much because of motion

sickness.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#63:1> The first few pages were good, not taking her into the novel-world as

they might have, but good.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#64:1> Then not enough, plainly not enough.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#65:1> She stationed herself by the front door, but near a clock so she

could tell the time.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#66:1> No one.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#67:1> A half-hour.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#68:1> Finally reading straightly.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#69:1> No one.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#70:1> An hour.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#71:1> No one yet, and maybe she ought to call again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#72:1> No answer.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#73:1> Another fifteen minutes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#74:1> She needed to go to the bathroom.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#75:1> If she went to the bathroom and he came or someone came while she

wasn't there, they would think because they were so late she had taken a taxi

after all and leave.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#76:1> She needed to go to the bathroom.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#77:1> He wouldn't send anyone else, they might not know her.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#78:1> He knew this bag, he had seen her carrying it.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#79:1> She took her wallet out of it and went to the bathroom.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#80:1> Her face was puffy, her skin shiny and slack and, yes, pale.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#81:1> She washed her face, quickly, put on a little lipstick, then rushed

out.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#82:1> No one was waiting by her bag.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#83:1> Fifteen minutes more had gone by.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#84:1> She managed another ten minutes, then called again.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#85:1> There was an answer, another female voice, this one younger.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#86:1> " Just a minute.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#87:1> Chris, Chris phone for you...
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#88:1> I don't know.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#89:1> Just pick it up, O.K.?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#90:1> " Hi, Chris.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#91:1> It 's me.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#92:1> I' 'mat the bus station, didn't you get my message?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#93:1> " What message?
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#94:1> That was it then, someone had forgotten to tell him, it was all right

and she could be a little annoyed but she was worried and now it was all

right. </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#95:1> She hadn't heard from him in the weeks he was gone, before they 'd

agreed she would come out to visit.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#96:1> It was a test, of sorts, for her, of her, checking out if it was all

right to let go and be themselves somewhere else sometimes.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#97:1> It was.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#98:1> She had read, and written, and worked hard, and gone out with

friends, and if, sometimes, getting home she was disappointed there was

nothing on the machine, still, they were being, separately, themselves.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#99:1> They would have things to tell each other.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#100:1> She looked forward to telling him things, saved funny stories, new

answers to ongoing discussions, lined up all the things she would tell him

about, couldn't even begin imagining what he would tell her because she never

could, he always surprised her by being exactly what he was without defense,

so that even the usual couldn't be predicted because you never knew when

suddenly he would be usual.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#101:1> " I called just before I left to tell you when I was getting here."

</p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#102:1> " Oh.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#103:1> Yeah." </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#104:1> " So I called to let you know when my bus got here - - I guess

you didn't get it?" </p>

<p> <ICE-USA:W2F-019#105:1> " No.
<ICE-USA:W2F-019#106:1> I got the message." </p> </I>
