<h> <bold> Can libraries stay up to date? </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#2:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#3:1>
Author Nicholas Negroponte called his book <mention> &ldquo; Being
Digital &rdquo; </mention> as being already obsolete the minute a reader gets
hold of it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#4:1>
What Mr. Negroponte wanted to point out is the &ldquo; exponential
&rdquo; change that is happening in society where &ldquo; bits, &rdquo;
instead of atoms like books, are becoming <quote> &ldquo; dominant units of
human interaction. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#5:1>
Does this mean then, that library books are already obsolete, too?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#6:1>
Not atoms, but the lack of funds and resources are keeping books
obsolete in Philippine libraries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#7:1>
A random check of libraries in Metro Manila indicate that the
computerization or automation of the library system is in its infancy stage
as admitted by some of the librarians interviewed by <mention> <it> Business
World Online </it> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#8:1>
These libraries include academic, specialized and public libraries.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#9:1>
In the book <mention> &ldquo; The Electronic Trail:
Computer-Assisted Research and Reporting in the Philippines, &rdquo;
</mention> the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism listed the
so-called electronic libraries which are either on-line libraries that can be
accessed remotely, or libraries that use library software for their
operations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#10:1>
But upon inspection, <mention> <it> Business World Online </it>
</mention> found that not many libraries have fully automated their
operations to make it easier for researchers to retrieve the information
gathered.

<p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#11:1>
Many of the Philippine libraries are electronic in the sense that
they use electronic access tools like CD-ROM databases or the Online Public
Access Catalog ( OPAC). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#12:1>
CD-ROM databases and OPAC can be easily implemented with
stand-alone computers like the case of the University of the Philippines (
UP) Diliman Main Library. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#13:1>
De La Salle University ( DLSU), on the other hand, recently
opened its CD-ROM network where researchers can simultaneously access some
CD-ROM databases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#14:1>
Both libraries and many other libraries in the Philippines are
using the UNESCO ( United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization)-distributed CDS-ISIS ( Computerized Documentation
System-Integrated Set of Information Systems), currently a text-based
searchable database of bibliographic information. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#15:1>
In these libraries, researchers still need to go physically to
each library to access their collections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#16:1>
Only a few are on-line with the bibliographic databases
accessible via the Internet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#17:1>
The more notable on-line library network is the science and
technology ( S&T) electronic library network of eight universities nationwide
under the World Bank-funded Department of Science and Technology-Engineering
and Science Education Program ( DoST-ESEP). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#18:1>
The ESEP schools include UP Diliman, UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, UP
Manila, DLSU, Ateneo de Manila University, University of Sto. Tomas,
University of San Carlos and Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of
Technology. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#19:1>
Using CD-ISIS and sometimes an integrated library system software
like the TINLIB ( The Information Navigator for Libraries System), the
bibliographic information under the ESEP network can be accessed via the
Internet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#20:1>
Through documentation services available from these libraries,
researchers can access the actual materials for a fee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#21:1>
The trend towards the computerization or automation of library
systems has been noted in the Philippines and worldwide since the 1980s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#22:1>
A 1986 UP thesis pointed out this observation in the country
while foreign literature support this observation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#23:1>
The UP study revealed that 29 out of 223 libraries and
information centers studied have developed or have been using computerized
systems while 55 are planning to use computers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#24:1>
However, the <quote> &ldquo; general trend is computerization &rdquo;
</quote> with the number of libraries using computers &ldquo; doubling
&rdquo; within one to two years, the study added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#25:1>
This study indicates that the Philippine library system is not
bad considering that an American observer also noted that online library
systems have become a &ldquo; reality &rdquo; only in the 1980s after eluding
<quote> &ldquo; library automators for two decades, &rdquo; </quote> said
David C. Genaway in his 1984 book on online library systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#26:1>
The culprit, as in the case these days, are the resources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#27:1>
However, Philippine libraries are not far behind other sectors or
organizations that are only getting automated in a world where everything is
going bits and electronic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#28:1>
In fact, some companies have only started computerizing lately. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#29:1>
Financial and personnel problems were identified in the UP study
as the factors that affect the implementation of library automation plans.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#30:1>
Mr. Genaway described it as <quote> &ldquo; sporadic,
unsystematic efforts &rdquo; </quote> as early as the 1960s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#31:1>
Said Richard De Gennaro in 1976: <quote> &ldquo; There are
indications that the advent of powerful and inexpensive minicomputers and
storage capabilities will lead to the revival of this concept ( of library
automation) in the next few years. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#32:1>
<h> <bold> ATTEMPTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#33:1>
DLSU director Perla S. Garcia recounted that the earlier attempts
of DLSU to computerize in the 1980s involved a minicomputer which gave them
technical and maintenance problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#34:1>
The same goes for the UP Diliman Main Library which used two
mainframe computers in the 1970s, said UP College of Science ( CS) librarian
Lourdes T. David in an interview with <mention> <it> Business World Online
</it> </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#35:1>
The savior is the microcomputer or the personal computer ( PC)
that was introduced in the 1970s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#36:1>
The successful implementation of the UP Diliman and DLSU library
systems are now being run in PCs or mid-range systems such as Unix-based
systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#37:1>
Given the limited resources, the librarians themselves will be
the first to tear down the walls that keep researchers distant from the
sources of information. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#38:1>
In UP, it was not until ESEP, UNESCO and the first Internet
access facility in the Philippines that the UP Diliman CS and College of
Engineering ( CoE) became automated and on-line. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#39:1>
Through UNESCO funds, the UP Diliman CS and CoE installed a fiber
optic cable network to interconnect the two libraries, said Ms. David. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#40:1>
Later, through the PHNet, the first Internet connection of the
Philippines supported by the DOST, the two UP libraries got on the Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#41:1>
This network is now known in UP as the DilNet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#42:1>
However, the UP Diliman Main Library, the &ldquo; mother &rdquo;
of all libraries in one of UP 's autonomous universities, only started its
Internet connection early this year, said Africa Castillo, Main Library head
of cataloging and computer services. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#43:1>
The National Library ( TNL), the mandated repository of
Philippine collections and the &ldquo; mother &rdquo; of all public
libraries, is awaiting telephone lines to enable them to connect to the
Internet, said its director Adoracion Mendoza-Bolos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#44:1>
Many of the librarians interviewed by <mention> <it> Business
World Online </it> </mention> admitted that they are just starting out with
their computerization such that only a few components of the on-line library
system or minimal computerization is already in place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#45:1>
While TNL has started its computerization in 1995, it is using
its TINLIB ( The Information Navigator for Libraries) for cataloging and
retrieval. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#46:1>
TINLIB is an integrated library system that incorporates the
library functions in a fully automated system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#47:1>
The components of TINLIB are cataloging and retrieval, acquisition,
circulation and serials management. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#48:1>
National Library data furnished <mention> <it> Business World
Online </it> </mention> showed the TINLIB database contains 100,845 records.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#49:1>
<h> <bold> PRIORITIES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#50:1>
Ms. Bolos added that TNL is prioritizing 1995 to current data to
be included in the databases.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#51:1>
Considering that the Philippine national library system has been
existing since the 1900s, then TNL still has a long way to go. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#52:1>
TNL recently launched its Public Information Library Network (
PUBLIN) which will interconnect the public libraries in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#53:1>
The implementation started with the distribution of PCs with library
software to 20 public libraries in Luzon and the training of librarians from
18 of these recipient libraries, said Ms. Bolos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#54:1>
TNL is currently facilitating the bidding of PCs for distribution
to public libraries in Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#55:1>
But these initiatives are meager considering that the number of
public libraries nationwide is less than two percent of the number of
libraries that are supposed to be established in the different <indig>
barangays </indig> , municipalities, cities and provinces. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#56:1>
Republic Act 7743 of 1994 mandates the establishment of
congressional, city, municipal libraries and <indig> barangay </indig>
reading centers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#57:1>
TNL data showed that of the 41,139 <indig> barangays </indig> ,
there are only 206 reading centers and out of the 1,526 municipalities, there
are only 474 municipal libraries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#58:1>
Funding government-run libraries is obviously a problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#59:1>
TNL being an attached agency of the Department of Education,
Culture and Sports ( DECS), it is not surprising to find out that it has
financial problems even when it comes to upgrading its resources into
automated systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#60:1>
Even with the DECS ' public school computerization program, which
had been getting legislative support by way of special appropriations, DECS
officials consider these appropriations a drop in the bucket. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#61:1>
For instance, for the 1996 computerization program, only 624
public high schools out of the 40,000 public elementary and high schools are
expected to benefit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#62:1>
Equally having financial difficulties are the National Economic
and Development Authority ( NEDA) Library in Pasig and the UP Diliman Main
Library. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#63:1>
The NEDA library only started this year the computerization of
its operations using the UNESCO CDS-ISIS ( Computerized Documentation
System-Integrated Set of Information Systems), said library services chief
Ellen Salvatierra. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#64:1>
Ms. Salvatierra cited the lack of funds as the reason why it is
automating late because the NEDA library does not get additional funds aside
from the regular budget. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#65:1>
Recently, the NEDA library acquired several computers with its
own funds and some from additional funds from a project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#66:1>
Even then, economic statistics from NEDA can be accessed online
through the NEDA Web site at <http://www.neda.gov.ph> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#67:1>
Aside from this, other attached NEDA agencies like the National
Statistics Coordination Board have automated library systems, said Ms.
Salvatierra. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#68:1>
The UP Diliman Main Library is also having financial problems
which is partly why its CD-ROM and OPAC services are not yet locally
networked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#69:1>
<mention> <it> Business World Online </it> </mention> learned of
a campus-wide proposal done in 1995 to network the UP Diliman library system
composed of 24 unit libraries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#70:1>
For around &peso;38 million, the 1995 proposal called for the
automation of the operations and services of each unit library, their
interoperability, and accessibility via the Internet through the DilNet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#71:1>
<mention> <it> Business World Online </it> </mention> has
attempted gathering data from the UP Diliman libraries and, based on
interviews with students, faculty and librarians themselves, this networked
library system is not yet operational. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#72:1>
Ms. David, head of the committee that drafted the 1995 plan, said
the UP administration has asked for an expanded proposal to include the other
library systems within the UP nationwide system composed of six autonomous
universities from Luzon to Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#73:1>
An estimated &peso;100 million is needed for the UP system-wide
computerization.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#74:1>
By order of priority, an estimated &peso;10 million is needed in the
first year to set up a hub in the UP Diliman Main Library to house a server
and the TINLIB software, said Ms. David. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#75:1>
The system-wide library proposal is seen to be part of the
ongoing system-wide electronic networking of the State University. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#76:1>
In an earlier interview, UP vice-president for information and
communication systems Emmanuel T. Velasco said UP is currently laying the
physical infrastructure to intercampus networking of the entire university
system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#77:1>
The wiring up of the UP Diliman Main Library building has been
identified as priority for the building 's local area networking ( LAN). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#78:1>
The LAN will network its on-line public access catalog ( OPAC)
which will eventually be accessed from a central database server, said Ms.
Castillo. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#79:1>
<h> <bold> ISLANDS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#80:1>
Currently, the Main Library has islands of databases being
maintained by the different sections of the library.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#81:1>
But the contents of the databases are still far from being complete
as Ms. Castillo admitted they still have more records to automate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#82:1>
For instance, data obtained from the UP Diliman Main Library showed
the book database contains 122,352 records out of the more than one million
volumes of books in their collection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#83:1>
The financial problem is shared by librarians nationwide, noted
Rod Tarlit, president of the Philippine Librarians Association, Inc. ( PLAI),
the association of professional librarians in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#84:1>
He told <mention> <it> Business World Online </it> </mention>
that while PLAI members are aware of the need to computerize and even conduct
seminars about this, the librarians are generally agreeable that their
libraries do not have enough funds to computerize operations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#85:1>
Aside from lack of funding, the lack of expertise on automation
among librarians and government policies likewise hinder the automation of
libraries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#86:1>
While the UP study revealed that librarians do not have negative
attitudes about the automation of library operations, other experts in the
field of information science are concerned over the lack of training and
expertise in implementing automation, and the lack of a government policy to
support the information specialists like librarians. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#87:1>
In an S&T forum last year, Science and Technology Information
Institute director Jose L. Guerrero noted that while librarians have great
potentials and are important in the development of S&T in the country, they
are also <quote> &ldquo; underrated professionals &rdquo; </quote> that have
yet to catch up with the latest developments in computer hardware and
software. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#88:1>
Taking off from Mr. Negroponte 's argument, Mr. Guerrero said the
information keepers/custodians like librarians <quote> &ldquo; can lead to
the gradual transformation ( of society) from the book to the digital era.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#89:1>
On the other hand, UP Institute of Library Science dean Josephine
Sison noted that the lack of a clearly stated policy on S&T information (
STI), however, is hampering the type of service these custodians can deliver
to the information users. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#90:1>
In the same forum, Ms. Sison suggested the STI policy should be a
government priority included in the National Information Technology Plan (
NITP), the former Ramos administration 's blueprint for IT in the country.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Drastic measures must be taken to prepare S&T
librarians for the emerging competition from other professions for a bigger
and bigger slice of the information pie, &rdquo; </quote> said Ms. Sison
while emphasizing that these professions should develop their skills in the
new information technologies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#92:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It would also be ideal if DTI services provision
is guided by a national information policy included in the NITP in the very
near future to lend focus and direction in this very important area, &rdquo;
</quote> she added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#93:1>
In the recent interview, Ms. Castillo said even with the updated
NITP, dubbed as <mention> IT 21 </mention> , there is no library component,
although there is an education component. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#94:1>
But library administrators are not the only hindrance to the
computerization of libraries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#95:1>
At the UP Diliman Main Library and the National Library, computer
services heads told tales of tampering with the computers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#96:1>
The National Library, for instance, already started using a
Windows-based OPAC for its information navigator.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#97:1>
However, library staff and Information Technology Center head Mercy
L. Roberto said they had to remove the Windows-based program because the
researchers allegedly got into other software programs in the computers aside
from the on-line public access catalog. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#98:1>
Similarly, Ms. Castillo told of cases where the OPAC databases
were deleted by the researchers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#99:1>
This problem caused the UP Diliman Main Library to settle for
stand-alone PCs such that if one PC 's database is deleted, the other units
can be used by the other researchers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#100:1>
With the UP Diliman on-line catalog becoming available in a
network by end August, Ms. Castillo is now getting concerned about securing
the network. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#101:1>
To remedy the problem about experts, Ms. David suggested forming
a team composed of a librarian, technical experts in computer system
administration or networking and hardware and software, and a database or
records management expert.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#102:1>
This team can work on a plan to establish the automated system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#103:1>
While bigger libraries have to cope with many problems, smaller
and specialized libraries are saved from administrative and resource
problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#104:1>
One specialized library that has hurdled the financial problems
is Ayala Foundation, Inc. 's Filipinas Heritage Library. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-039#105:1>
Library director Emelina Soriano Almario told <mention> <it>
Business World Online </it> </mention> the two-year-old library housing
<indig> Filipiniana </indig> collection is their implementation of an
electronic resource center. </p> </I>
