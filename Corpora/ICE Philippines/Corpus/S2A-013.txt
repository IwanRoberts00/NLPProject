<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#17:1:A>

So here we are for the final semi-final heat of the evening in the one-hundred meter backstroke
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#22:1:A>
The world record holder in this event is China 's Hesi Hon set in Rome in nineteen ninety-four and the Olympic record set in Barcelona nineteen ninety-two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#23:1:A>
The Japanese are making a very strong comeback in world swimming and they are doing it here in the Olympic games here in Sydney
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#24:1:A>
So swimmer to watch is on lane four Mai Nakamura with a qualifying time of one minute point eighty-eight seconds two lengths of the pool and whoever registers the fastest qualifying timing uh time top eight after the semi-finals will make it to the finals of this event
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#25:1:A>
So far Australia leading the medal haul uh for the gold with Ian Thorpe the torpedo winning two golds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#26:1:A>
Great start by Nakamura of Japan on lane number four and uh well he <&> should be she </&> was uh the one who came out last surface out of the water and she 's leading right now lane three also for <,,> Spain Ni&ntilde;a and as we can see them as they hit the first fifty we have Nakamura of Japan leading and registers the time of twenty-nine point thirty-six twenty-nine point seventy-four for Ni&ntilde;a for Spain and as we hit the final forty meters Nakamura of Japan still swimming very strong 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> Swimmer also on lane number six Inada Noriko of Japan coming back very strong in the home stretch of this race 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> Swimmer on lane three Ni&ntilde;a of Spain Nakamura fading
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#28:1:A>
Inada Noriko of Japan is coming back very strong on lane six and the winner is on lane number one uh lane number four Mai Nakamura with the time of one minute one point zero seven seconds and another Japanese one minute one point twenty-five Inada and in third place is Ni&ntilde;a Zhivanevska of Spain with the time of one minute one point forty-one seconds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#29:1:A>
So the Japanese are expected to be favorites in the finals for the one-hundred meter backstroke with two of them making it to the finals with very fast times Nakamura and Inada but the fastest time registered by Diana Moshanu or Moshanu of Romania
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#30:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> And we 'll be back with more of swimming from the Olympic Games here in Sydney after we pause for these reminders <&> break in recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#31:1:A>
We 're back here at the uh Sydney International Aquatic Center as we bring you our continuing coverage of swimming on day two and now we go to the two-hundred meter freestyle first semi-final event
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#32:1:A>
It 's gonna be very interesting to see again Ian Thorpe who 'll be swimming in heat number two of the semi-finals 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> The world record holder in this event is Ian Thorpe with the time of uh <,> one minute eighteen point eighteen seconds that 's a very fast time I think and uh he holds also the Olympic record set this morning with the time of one minute nineteen point eighty-two seconds here at the Aquatic Center 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> And the entries for semi-final heat one Stephan Paul on lane one Onison on lane number two from Israel Hoogenband is on lane number four lane five is Josh Davis of the United States Kat Goldblat on lane six with a qualifying time of one minute forty-nine point zero five seconds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#33:1:A>
Stephan Verst of Germany with a qualifying time of one minute forty-nine point eighty-four seconds and uh Il Batila Zubur with the qualifying time of one minute fifty point eleven seconds for to complete the cast of the first eight in semi-final heat number one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#34:1:A>
The World and Olympic record is held by no less than Ian Thorpe and is known as the torpedo torpedo so far <O> chuckle </O> two gold medals uh for Australia yesterday anchoring the four by one-hundred meter relay and beating the United States in this particular event
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#35:1:A>
So two golds one individual and one team for Ian Thorpe <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#36:1:A>
Remember this is four lengths of the pool
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#37:1:A>
The world record is one minute forty-five point fifty-one seconds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#38:1:A>
There should be a correction of what we have seen earlier here a split <,> and we see that the swimmer on lane four lane four is Hoogenband of the Netherlands together with Josh Davis and it 's the <w> Netherlands' </w> Hoogenband with twenty-four point fifty-one at the first fifty-meter mark 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> And uh we see that Josh Davis of the United States is trailing in third place James Salter of Great Britain as we hit the first one hundred first two lengths of this pool and uh it 's Hoogenband of uh the Netherlands with the time of fifty-one point twelve seconds Josh Davis fifty-one fifty-four James Salter of Great Britain in third place Van den Hoogenband starting to spread the field while Josh Davis is just trailing just half a body length as we hit the one-hundred fifty meter mark of the two-hundred meter freestyle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#39:1:A>
The world record just a correction for what we mentioned earlier is one minute forty-five point fifty-one <,> uh what we mentioned earlier was the first hundred uh uh fifty and we are approaching the homestretch of this race and Hoogenband of the Netherlands no doubt is going to win this very easily over Josh Davis of the United States and the battle for third is either on lane number three and lane number five but Hoogenband of the Netherlands winning with the time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five seconds and Josh Davis of the U S with the time of one minute forty-seven point o six seconds very slow record and that is a world record
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#40:1:A>
I think that 's a world record for you yes a world record by Hoogenband breaking the record of uh Ian Thorpe with a with a swim of one minute forty-five point thirty-five and breaking the record the world record and the Olympic record set by Ian Thorpe this morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#41:1:A>
So Pieter van de Hoogenband winning the first heat of the semi-finals with a time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#42:1:A>
There 's the dive and Josh Davis of the United States one forty-seven point zero six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#43:1:A>
It 's gonna be very interesting to see how the race will develop later on between Ian Thorpe and Hoogenband of the Netherlands
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#44:1:A>
And we 'll be back with semi-final heat number two in the two-hundred meter freestyle featuring Ian Thorpe of Australia winner already of two gold medals 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> And there 's the reaction from Hoogenband after setting the world record in the semi-final heat number one <&> break in recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#45:1:A>
Here at the Sydney International Aquatic Center and the Aussies are cheering for their hero in these Games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#46:1:A>
Ian Thorpe whose world record has just been broken by Pieter Van de Hoogenband of the Netherlands in the heat number one of the two-hundred meters freestyle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#47:1:A>
Well this morning he broke the Olympic records so the record now belongs to Hoogenband with the time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five seconds and done in semi-final heat number one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#48:1:A>
Brad Hackett <,,> of Australia swimming in lane number two with a qualifying time of one minute forty-nine point twenty-three seconds Rick Say of Canada lane three qualifying time is one minute forty-eight point sixty-two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#49:1:A>
There 's the event the man of the hour here in these Olympic Games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#50:1:A>
Ian Thorpe qualifying time is one minute forty-six point fifty-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#51:1:A>
This morning that was an Olympic record but just broken by Hoogenband of the Netherlands 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> On lane <,> five is Rossellino lane six is Igor Coledo of Belarus lane seven Great Britain 's Bob Palmer and uh Hungary 's Del Lazapatas with a qualifying time of one minute fifty point ten seconds in lane eight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#52:1:A>
The man to watch lane four of Australia Ian Thorpe broke the Olympic record this morning but that record has been broken just earlier by Hoogenband in the first heat of the semi-finals qualifying and Brad Hackett of Australia also seeded to be in the finals on lane number two and Canada 's Rick Say on lane three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#53:1:A>
Good start by Ian Thorpe very quick now leading the pack as we go for the first one hundred meters and Rick Say of Canada looking very strong also on lane four but Ian Thorpe is leading comfortably not yet and Rick Say is in lane number three and first to hit the wall is Ian Thorpe twenty-four point ninety-five twenty-five point ten by Rick Say of Canada and Ian Thorpe just taking a very easy swim he might be on world record pace after the first one hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#54:1:A>
And we can see that Ian Thorpe just taking it very easy as we go for the final ten meters and just spreading his <,,> uh strokes and first one hundred and here is Ian Thorpe with the time <,,> on his side uh right now uh hoping to break the record done by Hoogenband earlier swimming strong as we hit the one-hundred fifty meter mark and this is the final fifty coming uptime of one minute eighteen point sixty-seven that 's world record pace for you Ian Thorpe final forty and a crowd here at the Aquatic Center egging on Ian Thorpe of Canada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#55:1:A>
Rick Say is uh very much behind Rossellino of Italy swimming very strongly but Ian Thorpe very comfortable he might just go for a world record time is one <,> minute forty-five point thirty-seven just two hundredth of a second and well it 's still a world record of Hoogenband with one minute forty-five point thirty-five earlier 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#> And Ian Thorpe just registering one minute forty-five point thirty-seven to win heat number two and Rossellino of Italy with the time of one minute forty-six point sixty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#56:1:A>
There is Ian Thorpe jumping to the pool <,> very relaxed swim actually in the first one hundred and it was only in the last fifty that he he increased his pace and there is Ian Thorpe holder of two world records already here in these Games but falling short in breaking the record set by Hoogenband of the Netherlands just earlier in semi-final heat number one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-013#57:1:A>
It 's gonna be a very interesting race in the finals later on it 's going to be a one-on-one between Hoogenband the world record holder the new one and Ian Thorpe Australia 's golden boy in these Games <&> break in recording </&>
