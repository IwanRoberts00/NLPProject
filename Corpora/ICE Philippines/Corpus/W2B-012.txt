<h> <bold> What is a <indig> 'trapo' </indig> ? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#3:1>
<quote> &ldquo; IT is a piece of cloth used for cleaning, &rdquo;
</quote> Speaker Jose de Venecia told a talk show audience recently as he
tried vainly to recover the positive meaning of a word that has stubbornly
clung to him.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#4:1>
In this unique vocabulary of Philippine politics, it is not, of
course, the <indig> <it> trapo </it> </indig> 's cleaning power, but its
natural affinity with dirt, that is recalled when applied to politicians.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#5:1>
The term, as we know it, is a clever contraction of <mention>
&ldquo; traditional politician. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#6:1>
How this term came to acquire the negative values it signifies in our
political terminology remains a mystery to me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#7:1>
For the adjective <mention> &ldquo; traditional &rdquo; </mention> in
the Philippine context is typically employed in a positive light, as in
<mention> &ldquo; traditional values. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#8:1>
And the word <mention> &ldquo; politician, &rdquo; </mention> while
loaded with more negative than positive connotations, can actually be made to
look good when paired with an affirmative word, like <mention> &ldquo;
progressive &rdquo; </mention> or <mention> &ldquo; new. &rdquo; </mention>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#9:1>
In political theory, the term <mention> &ldquo; traditional
leadership &rdquo; </mention> is a purely analytical category.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#10:1>
The German sociologist Max Weber gave us three types of leadership:
charismatic, traditional, and legal-rational or bureaucratic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#11:1>
He had good as well as bad things to say about them all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#12:1>
The charismatic leader inspires faith and determination among his
followers, but in the long run, unable to organize and delegate authority, he
is unable to hold his constituency.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#13:1>
The traditional leader, on the other hand, inherits authority, and
represents a link in a hallowed chain, but, like many monarchs, his own
personal qualities may not suit him for the position into which he has been
thrust.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#14:1>
The bureaucratic leader, to Weber, is the model of the modern leader.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#15:1>
Chosen on the basis of his own merits and capabilities, he represents
a necessary link in a rational chain of command, but then, like the typical
bureaucrat, he may often lack the personal magic that alone can galvanize and
push a community forward. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#16:1>
Thus, Weber foresaw that political orders would tend to swing
from charisma to tradition to bureaucracy, and then back again to charisma.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#17:1>
His own view of progress favored the increasing rationalization of
every sphere of human activity, but he was also painfully aware that the
forces of renewal and vitality often come from territories outside reason.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#18:1>
There is nothing here that provides any basis for the
comprehensive denigration of the traditional politician that we find today in
Philippine politics.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#19:1>
The traditional politician in political theory may be part of a
dynasty and may often be proven to be unfit to rule, but he personifies
stability and continuity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#20:1>
In our own society in an earlier time, they would have been referred
to as <mention> gentlemen of the old school </mention> , for whom politics
was a calling or a vocation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#21:1>
But today 's <indig> <it> trapo </it> </indig> summons none of
this nostalgia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#22:1>
He finds himself in the same league as the <mention> &ldquo; crony
capitalist, &rdquo; </mention> a metaphor that was born in the Marcos years
to refer to a businessman who amasses wealth by the scandalous use of
political influence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#23:1>
The <mention> <indig> <it> trapo </it> </indig> </mention> in our
lexicon refers to a politician who uses wealth to buy power, exploits the
poverty of his constituents through selective patronage, and treats public
funds and facilities as if they were his own personal resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#24:1>
In his speeches, he casually makes extravagant promises, and recites
a litany of projects and accomplishments as if they were the heroic deeds of
a lone superman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#25:1>
The <indig> <it> trapo </it> </indig> has no unflinching
commitment to any set of ideals.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#26:1>
His only commitment is to himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#27:1>
His most highly valued skill is the ability to work out compromises
that offer something to everyone.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#28:1>
As far as he is concerned, everyone has a price. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#29:1>
Because he has no core self, except that which defines his thirst
for power, he has no problem assuming contradictory identities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#30:1>
And though he may sometimes justify this as ecumenism, it is really
nothing but opportunism.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#31:1>
The <indig> <it> trapo </it> </indig> will clothe himself in the
colors of the flag if that will make him seem like a patriot.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#32:1>
He will hang scapulars around his neck if that will project him like
a pious man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#33:1>
He will have his picture taken with his wife and children if that
will show that he is an ideal family man.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#34:1>
But, in the end, we don't know who he is, what he believes in, and
what higher things he lives for. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#35:1>
The revulsion against the <indig> <it> trapo </it> </indig> in
our society represents this generation 's deep yearning for a renewing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#36:1>
It comes from the same modernist impulse that unified the business
community at one time to launch a crusade against crony capitalism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#37:1>
After the overthrow of Marcos in 1986, almost everyone thought
the era of modern politics was at last upon us.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#38:1>
The old parties and political families had lain dormant for over two
decades.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#39:1>
And indeed, many new faces filled the political stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#40:1>
What we did not expect was the tenacity of the old political culture.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#41:1>
The new forces were not accustomed to the electoral arena.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#42:1>
They groped for models of how to reimagine democratic politics after
a dictatorship without going back to the familiar ways of patronage and
clientism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#43:1>
At the end of the Ramos presidency, we now know that Philippine
politics has come full circle.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#44:1>
Traditional politics is fully restored.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#45:1>
And those who had thought of themselves as its gravediggers remain as
marginal as ever.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#46:1>
The 1998 election is a watershed in our political life, for unless
the forces of modern politics come together to stop the <indig> <it> trapo
</it> </indig> 's final ascent to power, our nation may enter the new
millennium hopelessly weighed down by obsolete leaders. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#47:2>
<h> <bold> Looking back at Edsa </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#48:2>
<bold> Randy David </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#49:2>
<bold> LIKE </bold> many of the ordinary folk who attended its
birth 12 years ago, I have trouble summoning enough spirit to celebrate
another Edsa anniversary.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#50:2>
<mention> Edsa </mention> was about a people mustering their
collective will and courage to bring down a dictatorship by a direct
manifestation of their power.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#51:2>
That power drew its force from nothing more than the certainty of its
moral message.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#52:2>
It was otherwise basically unarmed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#53:2>
The message it embodied was simple: There is a limit to the abuse
of power.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#54:2>
For grossly enriching themselves at the expense of the nation, and
for causing untold oppression and suffering to the Filipino people, the
Marcoses and their cronies deserved to be the target of the people 's outrage
and must be booted out of office.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#55:2>
Government must serve the people, and not the other way around. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#56:2>
<mention> Edsa </mention> was a great moment in our nation 's
history.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#57:2>
Its significance is comparable to that of the 1896 Revolution.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#58:2>
But, for all the heroism it symbolizes, whenever we gaze back at
<mention> Edsa </mention> from the standpoint of the present, we get this
feeling that <mention> Edsa </mention> was, after all, not about a people
taking hold of their destiny, but only about a ruling elite ensuring their
survival by a timely adjustment within their ranks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#59:2>
It has become impossible to sustain the image of <mention> Edsa
</mention> as a revolution.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#60:2>
Not only has it not produced any meaningful change in the structure
of property and power in our society, in truth, it has also not led to any
discernible change in the faces of the people who own and run this country.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#61:2>
The same families and persons that dominated the nation 's economic
and political landscape during the Marcos years still preside over our
national life.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#62:2>
No Marcos relative or crony has been sent to jail for corruption.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#63:2>
No Marcos military or police officer has been publicly confronted or
convicted for human rights violations.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#64:2>
Worse, many people from the old regime who should be behind bars are
now occupying or running for public office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#65:2>
To be sure, some stolen property has been quietly returned to the
government.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#66:2>
And we are sometimes told about the aggregate value of such recovered
assets.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#67:2>
But we have seen neither an itemized public accounting of these
assets nor a description of the terms of their recovery.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#68:2>
We want to know if any deals were made between the government and
those who voluntarily returned stolen wealth.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#69:2>
Today, without bothering to consult the people, the government is
trying to work out a compromise with the Marcos family so that a portion of
the assets the dictator stashed away in Swiss banks may be returned to the
country as soon as possible.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#70:2>
The Supreme Court has convicted Imelda Marcos of graft, but she has
yet to spend a day in prison.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#71:2>
Was <mention> Edsa </mention> a lie, or are the Marcoses still in
power? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#72:2>
But, above all, <mention> Edsa </mention> was about a nation 's
redemption from the scourge of human rights violations, from the scandal of
torture, assassination and forced disappearances, and from the injustice of
indefinite detention and arbitrary arrests.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#73:2>
That is why we cannot remember <mention> Edsa </mention> without
asking how many human rights cases against the Marcos regime have been
resolved.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#74:2>
We cannot celebrate <mention> Edsa </mention> without asking how many
of those who have been amnestied for offenses committed during martial law
have confessed to their crimes and asked for forgiveness from those they have
wronged. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#75:2>
In contrast, a country like South Africa, newly released from the
shame of <foreign> apartheid </foreign> , has done much more in the last few
years to warrant a daily celebration of the freedom it now enjoys.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#76:2>
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by Bishop Desmond
Tutu, has been going through the painful process of bringing torturers and
assassins face to face with their victims.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#77:2>
These encounters have been cathartic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#78:2>
For most of the victims, they represent a necessary purifying closure
of a very personal tragedy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#79:2>
In a recent BBC documentary, Bishop Tutu was seen breaking down a
couple of times from the sheer anguish of listening to instances of cruel and
degrading punishment and watching their reenactment by those who originally
carried them out.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#80:2>
All this has been necessary, says the commission, not so much to
avenge past injury as to provide the occasion for victims to confront and to
forgive their tormentors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#81:2>
We have not attempted what the South Africans have done with
their past because I think we are afraid that we might come face to face with
our own individual complicity with the regime that victimized the nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#82:2>
This is a natural fear that we must overcome if we aspire to end the
cycle of compromises and accommodations that have hobbled our nation 's
journey into the future. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#83:2>
Dealing with the past is always a daunting task, whether for a
person or a nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#84:2>
On one hand, there is a constant need to go back to it to inspire us
and to validate our present strivings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#85:2>
In the process, we tend to fictionalize it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#86:2>
On the other, there is a need to un-remember the past so that we can
get on with our lives, and not allow imagined obligations to a heroic past to
constrain our inventiveness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#87:2>
In the process, we repeat the errors of the past. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#88:2>
There is a lesson to derive from all this: Though history has
much to teach us, a journey into our past should never leave us disgusted or
demoralized about the future.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#89:2>
The only way to avoid this is by gazing at the past from the clear
vantage point of someone who has figured out the road to the future.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#90:2>
Perhaps then, the only way to celebrate <mention> Edsa </mention>
without feeling violated and disenchanted is by looking at it as a work in
progress, rather than as a project completed. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#91:3>
<h> <bold> The dark threads of human behavior </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#92:3>
<bold> Randy David </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#93:3>
IN VARYING degrees, we sometimes behave in ways that mock the
very things we value.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#94:3>
Some of us are shocked by the realization of what we are capable of
doing, even as we desperately scan our past for its dark origins.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#95:3>
But all too often, the quest for intelligibility in our actions
collides against the illusions we quickly weave around our actions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#96:3>
Our capacity for &ldquo; motivated irrationality &rdquo; is only
matched by our skill at self-deception.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#97:3>
Thus, our minds remain opaque to ourselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#98:3>
Leo Echegaray will probably never understand what made him turn
his own 10-year-old daughter into a sexual object.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#99:3>
At some point, he may have deceived himself into thinking that she
was not his real daughter, and that he was really in love with her.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#100:3>
No one knows how he worked through the darker threads of his soul to
justify what he was doing, or how he managed to conceal to himself the
meaning of his act.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#101:3>
In this daunting situation, he certainly is not alone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#102:3>
I suppose US President Bill Clinton will never understand why
anyone as powerful, as clever and as attractive as he could ever find himself
caught in a potentially damaging relationship with a very insecure young
woman like Monica Lewinsky.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#103:3>
Like Echegaray, he might have thought he could get away with it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#104:3>
But that does not explain why and how he got into it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#105:3>
If the meanings of our actions were always immediately transparent
to us, we should never find ourselves in situations that could damage us.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#106:3>
Some people may object to this comparison, for indeed in Clinton 's
case, we are dealing with two consenting adults, whereas in Echegaray 's we
are face to face with an adult who raped his own child.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#107:3>
But the point I am making is that in both situations, we expect a
rational human being to be able to restrain himself from doing anything so
foolish and self-destructive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#108:3>
<quote> &ldquo; It is because people often behave in bizarre ways,"
</quote> says Jonathan Lear in his book <mention> &ldquo; Open-minded:
Working out the logic of the soul, &rdquo; </mention> <quote> &ldquo; ways
which cause pain to themselves and others, ways which puzzle even the actors
themselves, that psychoanalysis commands our attention. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#109:3>
Most Americans think that like any other human being with a
problem, Clinton may need therapy and personal counseling to help him sort
out what is causing all the trouble within him.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#110:3>
But as president of the United States, they also believe he is doing
a great job, and there is no reason to expose him to further humiliation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#111:3>
Republicans insist he is a criminal, a morally inept leader who lied
before the nation and obstructed justice, and should therefore be tried and
removed from the presidency before he does further damage to it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#112:3>
The polls show that the Republicans do not understand the mind of
the American nation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#113:3>
The admirable sensibility shown by the American people on this
issue is obviously born of compassion and humility in the face of the
intractable threads of human behavior.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#114:3>
Its opposite--arrogant knowingness--is what gets in the way of the
kind of non-defensive self-understanding to which, Lear says, nations and
individuals must aspire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#115:3>
It is true that reason demands that we defend our laws and our
institutions if we must remain a community.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#116:3>
We should not flinch from the task of penalizing those who violate
the values of the community if we are to preserve some order in our social
lives.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#117:3>
But reason also requires that we recognize the persistent
unintelligibility of a great part of human behavior.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#118:3>
That we temper our inclination to punish with the recognition that
all of us are potentially self-destructive and immoral, even if only in our
dreams. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#119:3>
Obviously, I am saying all this not on behalf of Clinton who, I
am certain, will not be impeached, but because of Echegaray, who I am afraid,
will not be spared.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#120:3>
Killing him may or may not deter future rapists; it may or may not
frighten fathers who sexually abuse their daughters.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#121:3>
But one thing is certain: Killing him will not lead us any closer to
an understanding of the dark inner threads and social contingencies that
predisposed him and many others to commit the outrageous acts for which we
sentence them to die. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#122:3>
Maybe nothing will ever make us fully understand the ways of the
human mind.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#123:3>
But this should give us all the more reason to moderate the
certainty that the imposition of the death penalty presupposes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#124:3>
Do we really know what it means to kill a human being, asks
Edward Tivnan in his book, <mention> &ldquo; The Moral Imagination. &rdquo;
</mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#125:3>
Tivnan brings up George Orwell 's story of a condemned man he was
leading to the gallows while stationed with the colonial police in Burma.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#126:3>
As they marched, a dog suddenly appearing from nowhere approached
the prisoner and tried to lick his face.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#127:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Everyone stood aghast," </quote> Orwell recalls.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#128:3>
As they resumed their walk, the condemned man self-consciously
stepped aside at one point to avoid a puddle. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#X129:3>
<quote> &ldquo; It is curious, but till that moment I had never
realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#X130:3>
When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the
mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in
full tide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#X131:3>
This man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#X132:3>
He and we were a party of men walking together, seeing, hearing,
feeling, understanding the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden
snap, one of us would be gone -- one mind less, one world less... &rdquo;
</quote> </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#133:3>
Many Filipinos will likely tell Orwell that the world would be
better off if permanently rid of the likes of Echegaray.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#134:3>
Other nations do not think so.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-012#135:3>
It all depends on the self-image we hold as a people. </p> </I>
