 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#1:1:A>
All of these uh issues uh we are to deal with this afternoon uh
Your Honors <,> involve uh the jurisdiction of the Senate to try and decide
 <,> alleged acts of the Respondent not alleged in the Articles of Impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#2:1:A>
There are subsidiary issues with respect to certain accounts because
they are not in the name of the Respondent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#3:1:A>
I will deal with them <,> at the end of my arguments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#4:1:A>
I have uh distributed if Your Honors please uh a a copy of the
pertinent portions of Article two of the Articles of Impeachment together
with uh a <,> brief statement as to what are the conclusions <,> therein as
well as the allegations of fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#5:1:A>
There are two kinds of assets if Your Honors please which are
involved uh in these uh subpoena <foreign> duces tecums </foreign> as well as
the second envelope
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#6:1:A>
First are the alleged mansions particularly in the case of the
second envelope what has been referred to as the Boracay mansion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#7:1:A>
The other asset involved are cash assets or their equivalent which
are <,> involved in all of the other subpoena <foreign> duces tecums
 </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#8:1:A>
It first it should be recalled if Your Honors please that under
Article eleven of the Constitution the House of Representatives shall have
the sole <,> shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of
impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#9:1:A>
No other body has that authority not the Senate not any other
department of government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#10:1:A>
On the other hand the Senate has the sole power to try and decide
all cases of impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#11:1:A>
A case of impeachment comes before the Senate if Your Honors please
in the form of Articles of Impeachment which are sent to the Senate by the
House of Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#12:1:A>
The power of the Senate the sole power of the Senate to try and
decide a case of impeachment cannot go beyond the allegations in the Articles
of Impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#13:1:A>
Issues now before the Court revolve on Article two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#14:1:A>
At the preliminary conference the first preliminary conference held
among the parties it was agreed that under Article two the issue would be the
following whether on the basis of the facts and I underscore the word
 <mention> facts </mention> alleged therein the President would be guilty of
graft and corruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#15:1:A>
Once again I underscore the word <mention> facts </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#16:1:A>
Let me now invite the members of the Court to go through the
pertinent provisions uh <.> por </.> uh the pertinent provisions portions of
Article two copies of which I have distributed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#17:1:A>
It says <quote> President Estrada violated the Constitution and he
stands guilty of graft and corruption </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#18:1:A>
Those that clause if Your Honors please is a conclusion of law it
is not a statement of fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#19:1:A>
Then it proceeds to state <quote> when he participated directly in
the real estate business through a family-controlled corporation which
constructed thirty-six townhouses in Vermont Park Executive Village Antipolo
City as shown in the P C I J in the article on President Estrada 's Family
and Financial Interests </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#20:1:A>
That clause is a statement of fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#21:1:A>
The following paragraph reads <quote> He also violated the
Anti-Graft Law he is sworn to uphold </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#22:1:A>
That Your Honors is a conclusion it is not a statement of fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#23:1:A>
And then it the following follows <quote> He filed his Statement of
Assets and Liabilities for the year nineteen ninety-nine stating therein that
he and his wife and children have business interests in only three
corporations </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#24:1:A>
That Your Honors is a statement of fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#25:1:A>
Following that is the sentence <quote> The President by that sworn
statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth
 </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#26:1:A>
That Your Honors is a conclusion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#27:1:A>
Then what follows is this statement of fact because it says <quote> 
Records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have
other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his
Statement of Assets </quote> open parenthesis Annex C <?> zero </?> close
parenthesis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#28:1:A>
Statement of facts in the last sentence reads and I repeat <quote> 
Records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have
other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his
Statement of Assets and Liabilities </quote> parenthesis Annex C <?> zero
 </?> nothing more Your Honors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#29:1:A>
So let me start with the easier one cash assets
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#30:1:A>
There is nothing in these Articles of Impeachment which states that
the President failed to declare in his Statement of Assets and Liabilities
cash assets
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#31:1:A>
Nor in the second does he in the second sentence do we find any <.> 
impli </.> uh any any statement of fact about assets because in the second
sentence it simply says <quote> Records show that he and his wife and
mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside
of the three firms listed in his Statement of Assets and Liabilities </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#32:1:A>
So what is alleged as a factual basis of the assertion that the
President violated his sworn statement by committing perjury and the offense
of unexplained wealth incidentally there is no such offense as simply limited
to the failure to state in his Statement of Assets and Liabilities other that
is other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in
his Statement of Assets and Liabilities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#33:1:A>
As I said insofar as the cash assets there is nothing whatsoever
here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#34:1:A>
Now <,> it will be noted if Your Honors please in Annex C Annex C
is a comprehensive list of corporations in which the Respondent is supposed
to have other interest which interests rather which he did not declare in his
Statement of Assets
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#35:1:A>
All in all these corporations number eighty-eight corporations some
Table two of the President Table three Guia Gomez Table four Laarni Enriquez
Table five Joseph Victor Ejercito Table six <.> selec </.> selected companies
of Estrada and his families
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#36:1:A>
So insofar as corporate interests if Your Honors please what need
to be determined is whether in the case of the second envelope St. Peter 's
Holdings is listed is among these corporations listed in Annex C
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#37:1:A>
As far as the second envelope is concerned if Your Honors please
 <,> we may <.> assu </.> we may deduce from the application that the
intention is to establish that the check which was supposed to have funded
the payment for what we call the Boracay mansion purchased by St. Peter 's
Holdings was funded in ultimately from savings account O one six zero six two
five zero one dash five and that is why what is sought now to be produced is
the statement of account for October one to thirty-one nineteen ninety-nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#38:1:A>
It may be recalled if Your Honors please that uh when on December
fifteen uh December twenty the first envelope was opened it was found that in
that envelope there were the applications to open accounts specimen
signatures etcetera of account number and uh one one zero two five four nine
four <.> da </.> dash five as well as microfilm copy of the Equitable Bank
check numbers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#39:1:A>
Those were what were in the first envelope
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#40:1:A>
Now what is now sought to be produced is the statement of account
of a savings account which we assume the prosecution contends will show that
the check which was used to fund the price for the payment of the what we
call Boracay mansion in the name of St. Peter 's Holdings was funded from
this statement from this account savings account
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#41:1:A>
So in effect what is now asserted is to prove that the President
was the one who acquired the Boracay mansion through St. Peter 's Holdings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#42:1:A>
But as we have stated St. Peter 's Holdings is not among the
corporations listed in Annex C
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#43:1:A>
There is one other flaw if Your Honors please
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#44:1:A>
After the first envelope was opened which should have been the
premise assuming uh my assumptions are correct in regard the second envelope
not any of the documents in the first envelope was marked as an exhibit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#45:1:A>
So that if the papers in the first envelope are the predicates for
the opening of the second envelope that predicate does not exist
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#46:1:A>
Because the papers which were found in the second envelope have not
been marked as exhibits much less established as belonging to <&> break in
tape </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#47:1:A>
<&> missing words </&> the issue of relevancy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#48:1:A>
They go to the issue of jurisdiction whether the jurisdiction of
the Senate to try and decide this case goes beyond can go beyond the specific
factual allegations of the Articles of Impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#49:1:A>
It is our submission that the Senate is without jurisdiction to try
and decide any accusation based on any act other than those which are
specifically alleged in the Articles of Impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#50:1:A>
Now as to the other subpoenas if Your Honors please they are
accounts even far removed from the account supposedly related to the
acquisition of a property by St. Peter 's Holdings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#51:1:A>
They involve cash assets or their equivalent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#52:1:A>
Well perhaps as far as the accounts of President in the name of
President Estrada and the First Lady assuming that cash assets are
contemplated are covered by the Articles of Impeachment we may say they are
within the jurisdiction of the Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#53:1:A>
But you have other accounts uh which are the subject of subpoena
 <foreign> duces tecums </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#54:1:A>
Some of the subpoenas apply uh for subpoena <foreign> duces tecum
 </foreign> to be directed to account numbers without any names
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#55:1:A>
How can the relevancy the fact that these are within the <.> juris
 </.> within covered by the Articles of Impeachment be determined on the basis
of the application
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#56:1:A>
Similarly you have this Kevin Garcia Jose Velarde and other names
which are not in the names of the President and not even in the names of
Laarni Guia Gomez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#57:1:A>
They cannot be presumptively they cannot be deemed as presumptively
belonging to the Respondent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#58:1:A>
There is one other noteworthy fact if Your Honors please regarding
these applications for subpoena
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#59:1:A>
It will be recalled that uh it was agreed among the parties that
when a subpoena <foreign> duces tecum </foreign> is applied for the
particular check if it be a check which would show the relevancy of the
application would be indicated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#60:1:A>
And that beyond that there cannot be a comprehensive or catch-all
phrase to cover all documents and records in that account
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#61:1:A>
These applications for subpoena <foreign> duces tecum </foreign> 
have sought to circumvent the agreement that there should be no comprehensive
clause in subpoena <foreign> duces tecums </foreign> addressed to banks
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#62:1:A>
What the prosecution has done is to list everything that one may
find in a bank account or ledgers or accounts except that instead of saying
that all ledgers all accounts they have now specified this one by one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#63:1:A>
That is why if Your Honors please the applications for subpoena
 <foreign> duces tecum </foreign> s have have uh enumerations of documents
covering about two pages in single space of documents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#64:1:A>
As a matter of fact if Your Honors please in the case of the second
envelope if assuming the <.> materia </.> assuming that that is within the
jurisdiction of the Senate what should only the subpoena <foreign> duces
tecum </foreign> should be limited only to what is necessary to determine
whether the check that was drawn on the current account was funded from the
savings account
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#65:1:A>
It would be inappropriate even assuming that purpose to expose the
entire statement of account for that month much less other documents
pertaining to that savings account
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#66:1:A>
As a matter of fact uh assuming that the Court does not sustain us
on the jurisdiction issue and that uh the prosecution 's desire is simply to
establish that the check was funded from that savings account we would be <.> 
abl </.> be willing to stipulate that assuming that that is the purpose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#67:1:A>
So then if Your Honors please the issue is not really that
complicated but it is an issue which we have raised many times in this uh
trial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#68:1:A>
Unfortunately there has really been no definitive ruling on this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#69:1:A>
Perhaps it is time that a ruling be made because what has happened
really when the first envelope was opened we raised that issue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#70:1:A>
But then the whole the documents had already been exposed and so we
said since the matter has been made practically public uh we agreed not to
pursue our motion for reconsideration but reserving our right to object on
the matter of materiality or jurisdiction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#71:1:A>
Similarly when the Clarissa Ocampo testimony was made we likewise
objected but the testimony was allowed to be given although conditionally
given
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-066#72:1:A>
So the issue before the Court if Your Honors please is simply
whether the Articles of Impeachment contain any allegation of fact to show
that the act the alleged act of the President in having cash assets or
interests in corporations other than those listed in Annex C are sufficiently
alleged in the Articles of Impeachment so that the Senate would have
jurisdiction to try and decide them </I>
