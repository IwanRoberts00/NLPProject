<h> <bold> RP: Asia 's next energy exporter? </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#2:1>
<bold> Emmie V. Abadilla </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#3:1>
The Philippines, which imports over 200 million barrels of fuel
oil annually, can become an energy exporter to East Asia in 30 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#4:1>
That is, if it plays its cards right and government lures enough
private businesses to build large scale ocean, solar and wind power ( OSW)
systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#5:1>
It will cost the state &dollar;29 million ( &peso;754 million)
just to establish a short-term plan of action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#6:1>
Never mind long term costs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#7:1>
The tab for establishing an Asian power grid, a regional power market
centered in the Philippines, as well as OSW plants and manufacturing
industries for OSW power systems cannot be ascertained to date. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#8:1>
One thing is sure, however.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#9:1>
The Philippines gains 266 million megawatts of exportable power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#10:1>
And the prospect is not even a remote dream. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#11:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The technology is available, the only problem is
economics, &rdquo; </quote> stressed Department of Energy ( DOE)
Undersecretary Guillermo Balce. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#12:1>
Of course, technology using new locally-sourced renewable energy
has always been more expensive than traditional technologies using imported
resources such as oil, gas and coal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#13:1>
It costs only &dollar;750 to produce one kilowatt ( kw) of
electricity using gas, &dollar;900 per kw, using oil and &dollar;1,150/kw,
using coal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#14:1>
Generating electricity through wind power costs &dollar;1,000/kw,
through biomass using ricehull, &dollar;1,400/kw and municipal solid waste,
&dollar;2,500/kw. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#15:1>
But using ocean power, one spends a whopping &dollar;11,000/kw
and &dollar;7,000/kw, for solar energy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#16:1>
Once OSW power is produced on a large scale with <quote> &ldquo;
the determined effort of government and private sector &rdquo; </quote> ,
economies of scale could eventually prevail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#17:1>
Developing alternative sources of energy is inevitable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#18:1>
DOE underscored that traditional sources of indigenous power will
not make the Philippines energy self-sufficient within 30 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#19:1>
Without OSW, the country will still import 60 percent of its
energy needs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#20:1>
Ocean, solar and wind power sources has a potential for
generating more than enough power to provide the 100,000 mw requirements of
the Philippines by year 2025. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#21:1>
And it 's about time the country is weaned from traditional
energy sources which are hazardous to the environment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#22:1>
Power plants using coal and fossil fuels emit sulfur dioxides,
nitrogen oxides and toxic gases that contribute to global warming.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#23:1>
The dreaded <mention> &ldquo; greenhouse effect. &rdquo; </mention>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#24:1>
On top of that, undiscovered sources of oil, gas, coal and
nuclear power will generate a scant 59,000 mw. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#25:1>
The amount of discovered resources can only provide 29,000 MW, or
12 percent of the total energy demand 28 years from now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#26:1>
On the other hand, renewable sources of energy such as OSW, are
not just environment-friendly but inexhaustible as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#27:1>
The only hitch is they are mainly undefined. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#28:1>
DOE estimates undefined and undiscovered capacity for ocean power
at 300 million mw and 864,000 mw for solar power.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#29:1>
The defined capacity for wind power, on the other hand, is 200 mw.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#30:1>
Geothermal power still has 1,300 mw of undefined capacity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#31:1>
Biomass has 6,000 mw. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#32:1>
Besides being a tremendous untapped powerhouse located in an area
of vast ocean, solar and wind resources, the Philippines has other advantages
as an exporter of power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#33:1>
Geographically the country is in a strategic position in plans
for an Asian power interconnection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#34:1>
Being at the center of the region, it can be a central
distributor of OSW power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#35:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We can become an energy exporter to Asia if we
focus on ocean, solar and wind resources, &rdquo; </quote> Balce reiterated.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#36:1>
Ocean energy options had been used by other countries for quite
sometime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#37:1>
Tidal power systems using the recurring rise and fall of coastal
waters in response to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, had been
operating in France as early as 1996; in the USSR since 1967; Canada and
China have used them since the 80s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#38:1>
Wave energy systems, where large scale wind machines powered by
the sun generate waves had generated less than 500 kw in demo units in the
United Kingdom, Norway, Japan and the US. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#39:1>
Large scale commercial applications are not feasible to date,
however.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#40:1>
Operators find it difficult to maintain stations during stormy seas
and costly to use power conditioning equipment to provide steady outputs
under varying wave conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#41:1>
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion ( OTEC), using temperature
differences between warm surface waters and cold waters from the sea bottom
to power turbines, had been demonstrated in experimental 50 kw systems in
Hawaii.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#42:1>
They are now developing an experimental 165 kw OTEC system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#43:1>
Ocean current systems, operating underwater windmills or turbines
powered by the flow of moving water had been tested in Canada, and Australia.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#44:1>
On the other hand, wind turbine generators had been installed
worldwide since 1993, with capacities of about 3,000 mw. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#45:1>
US leads major users and developers of wind energy, boasting of
1,700 mw total capacity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#46:1>
Europe is catching up, installing the world 's largest wind turbines,
with capacities ranging from 100kw to 340kw per unit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#47:1>
Asian countries have the most number of small scale units at less
than 1 kw per unit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#48:1>
By 2005, experts estimate that wind turbines generating 18,500 mw
will be installed in US, India, China, Spain and Germany. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#49:1>
Meanwhile, in the Philippines, the National Power Corp. has
installed a 10 kw wind turbine demonstration unit for a small village power
project in Ilocos Norte. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#50:1>
Then, we have photovoltaic ( PV) power systems using solar cells
to convert light directly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#51:1>
Some remote areas, such as Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, had
been using PV systems since 1994.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#52:1>
One &peso;1.5 million PV project benefitted 100 households. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#53:1>
Establishing a Philippine Solar Energy Society, a local chapter
of the international group, may further unite the efforts of the PV industry
and the government to come up with an effective promotion and
commercialization program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#54:1>
Already, automation, better designs and improved manufacturing
have pulled down PV prices significantly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#55:1>
After all is said and done, OSW development is a must to enable
the Philippine energy sector to &ldquo; pole-vault &rdquo; into the 21st
century, DOE emphasized. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#56:1>
Towards this end, DOE plans to create a fund to establish a
system allocating exclusive areas for OSW development over the short term.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#57:1>
The system, which resembles the service contract scheme of oil
and gas producers will open opportunities to the private sector.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#58:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If the system is institutionalized the private sector
can apply for OSW service contracts within certain areas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#59:1>
In this manner, we can also avoid conflicts in the right way, &rdquo;
</quote> the energy undersecretary pointed out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#60:1>
To bring down the costs of generating power through OSW, DOE also
proposed to establish a center for research to tackle the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#61:1>
The center will be funded from the agency 's &peso;300 million
per year Special Energy Fund.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#62:1>
About 25 percent of the fund will go to research and 25 percent for
OSW development. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#63:1>
Of course, many are still apprehensive that the Philippines
cannot be as competitive as its ASEAN neighbors when it comes to energy
exports. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#64:1>
Malaysia, for instance is perceived to be more strategically
located and more financially capable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#65:1>
Skeptics argued the Philippines has to learn to walk before it
runs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#66:1>
First, it must satisfy its local energy requirements before even
contemplating such an ambitious export program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#67:1>
While DOE conceded these concerns are serious it maintained that
focusing on OSW systems provides the Philippines with the technological and
economic advantage to gear up to become an energy exporter in the future.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#68:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If the country pursues its pole-vaulting program
now, it will have the superiority in energy technology and resources
availability twenty years hence, &rdquo; </quote> Balce argued. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-032#69:1>
By that time, its ASEAN neighbors will be scrounging for the
fossil fuels that abound today. </p> </I>
