<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#1:1:A>
<indig> Para sa akin </indig> and yet on the other hand we have
to admit we do have a surfeit of people doing charity work

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#2:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#3:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#4:1:A>
There are agencies of the government that make seven copies of the
 <.> corp </.> corporate of a correspondence when they need only one to send
and the second to keep <indig> ano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#5:1:A>
<indig> Mga </indig> things like that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#6:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#7:1:A>
I think really uh that we have instead of cutting down on the
number of the bureaucracy we have to try to retrain some of them and put them
into the social services the teachers the rural workers stuff like that
 <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#8:1:A>
<indig> 'Yan </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#9:1:B>
And you say Congress is the place to do it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#10:1:A>
Well I think it 's where we initiate actions <indig> 'no
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#11:1:A>
Uh and and Congress to my mind has has done a lot of things
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#12:1:A>
For instance in the last uh session <indig> 'no </indig> people
people tend to denigrate Congress
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#13:1:A>
But in fact uh some substantial things have happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#14:1:A>
For instance the standardization of uh of uh positions in the in
the in the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#15:1:A>
That was to me a very big <{> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#16:1:B>
<[> Civil service </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#17:1:A>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#18:1:A>
In the standardization of positions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#19:1:A>
Everybody now whether you are a justice or a or a janitor or a
driver you know you belong to some salary grade and you 're the same
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#20:1:A>
That cuts across the entire bureaucracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#21:1:A>
That was a very big step forward
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#22:1:A>
I think Congress still has the ability to make changes like that
 <O> music </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#23:1:B>
Okay we 'll be right back
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#24:1:B>
<unclear> words </unclear> the lone district of Para&ntilde;aque
and he 's running under the N U C D
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#25:1:B>
And uh he is the recently resigned chairman of the Public Estates
Authority
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#26:1:B>
You 're in some kind of a controversy over the proclamation of uh
Manila Bay converting it into a satellite city of some sort

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#27:1:C>
Yes yes uh when you when you plan ahead and you <{> <[> have
big projects </]> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#28:1:C>
You think of ten years from now it 's always controversial
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#29:1:C>
But it 's exciting

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#30:1:B>
<[> You 're five years ahead </]> </}> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#31:1:B>
Now since you arrived late can we just ask you one question before
we go to the non-runners here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#32:1:B>
Why are you seeking public office after your job at the P E A
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#33:1:B>
Is there is this a power trip of some kind to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#34:1:B>
You can't let go of power you can't stop pushing people and pushing
buttons

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#35:1:C>
No ahm in the Public Estates Authority I 've learned a lot and
I think I 've done projects that are good for not only Para&ntilde;aque but
uh Pasay City and as far as Las Pi&ntilde;as
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#36:1:C>
But since I 'm a resident at Para&ntilde;aque I 'd really like to
continue the work that we 've started in the Public Estates Authority

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#37:1:B>
Such as

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#38:1:C>
And uh oh many many projects
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#39:1:C>
We started the coastal road
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#40:1:C>
It 's now expanded to six lanes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#41:1:C>
We 've lighted it up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#42:1:C>
Uh the coastal road used to be a salvaging zone now peace and order
prevails there because we 've set up a police precinct
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#43:1:C>
The southern police district is now also located in the coastal
road
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#44:1:C>
We 're building two hospitals there one a ten story hospital
another one a twenty-four hour emergency clinic

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#45:1:B>
Government hospital

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#46:1:C>
No this is a joint venture between the government and the
private sector

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#47:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#48:1:C>
We 're also building the uh one of the biggest uh low cost
housing areas in the government in cooperation with uh then G S I S general
manager Sonny Belmonte

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#49:1:B>
<{> <[1> So you 're afraid </]> you 're to let go of these
beautiful projects you know [ 2> As a private citizen </]> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#50:1:B>
But as a congressman you think you can supervise uh these projects
in the future

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#51:1:C>
<[1> <unclear> words </unclear> <indig> pangarap </indig> 
 </unclear> </]> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#52:1:C>
<[2> That 's one that 's one </]> </}> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#53:1:C>
You know uh one thing you learn in government is that uh there are
many things that you 'd like to do but you can't do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#54:1:C>
And there are many things that have to be done to uh to make
government become more efficient
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#55:1:C>
And one of the things that you have to do is perhaps improve some
of the laws <{> <[> that </[> restrict government from becoming more
efficient

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#56:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#57:1:B>
So when you become a congressman you will liberalize and deregulate

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#58:1:C>
That 's one of the things I 'd really like to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#59:1:C>
You see in government uh if you 're too slow they say uh you 're
too slow why are you too slow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#60:1:C>
If you 're too fast they say uh <{> <]> what 's wrong with you how
come you 're too fast </]> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#61:1:C>
So it 's got to be rationalized
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#62:1:C>
I mean you know we have to assume that government people are
working in government because they want to do a good job
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#63:1:C>
The idea is to make it easier for them to do a good job rather than
to make it difficult uh to do a good job
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#64:1:C>
And I think a few uh legislative pieces of <.> legis </.> uh
legislation <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#65:1:B>
<[> There 's something </]> </}> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#66:1:B>
Okay so now we 've heard practically all the reasons for running
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#67:1:B>
Now let 's go to the <O> laughter </O> to the Customs Commissioner
and the uh Airport General Manager
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#68:1:B>
You know I think you two are just as good healthy energetic
innovative <foreign> etcetera </foreign> as uh these gentlemen who are
running
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#69:1:B>
Uh but why aren't you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#70:1:B>
Don't you want to serve the people quote quote
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#71:1:B>
Uh Commissioner Apacible

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#72:1:D>
Well in my case Jullie in nineteen eighty-four I was a uh very
reluctant uh uh candidate for Congress already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#73:1:D>
So <indig> nakadanas na rin ako ng kampanya sa Batangas buong
probinsiya pa e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#74:1:D>
At that time I was still a bachelor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#75:1:D>
So I had nothing to worry about
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#76:1:D>
But uh when the next elections came I was about to run I was
already serving the Development Bank of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#77:1:D>
uh I told myself you know I just uh have served government and
doing something for our people in D B P
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#78:1:D>
<indig> Hindi naman pala kailangang mahalal para tumulong sa tao
 </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#79:1:B>
Uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#80:1:D>
<indig> Kaya noong </indig> eighty-seven <indig> nagpaplano na
rin akong mag-asawa sabi ko pagka kung papasok ako sa pulitika baka magulo
lang ang buhay ko kaya inuna ko muna 'yong aking pamilya sapagkat medyo huli
na akong nag-asawa
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#81:1:D>
At uh dalawa lang kaming lalaki sa pamilya eh </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#82:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#83:1:D>
<indig> Kaya </indig> since <indig> nauna siya sa pulitika e
di siya na muna
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#84:1:D>
Kasi alam mo palabas ang pera diyan sa pulitika eh </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#85:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#86:1:D>
<indig> Kailangan naman ng isa para mag-alaga sa mga kapatid
dahil lima ang mga kapatid kong babae </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#87:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#88:1:D>
<indig> Kaya patay na ang ama namin kaya sabi ko ako na lang
siguro ang mag-aalaga sa pamilya ng naiwan kong ama at saka pamilya ko naman
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#89:1:D>
Habang siya naman ay naroon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#90:1:D>
Pag sawa na siya siguro puwedeng pag-isipan ko na </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#91:1:B>
Uh what do you intend to do once you become a private citizen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#92:1:B>
<.> Wo </.> won't you miss the power you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#93:1:B>
Now you can uh order people to do this to do that things happen uh
with a snap of the fingers

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#94:1:D>
Yeah actually <indig> kasi </indig> Jullie <indig> ang
 </indig> orientation <indig> natin nagsimula tayo sa </indig> opposition
 <indig> na 'yon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#95:1:D>
There was a time from nineteen seventy-eight to nineteen
eighty-four I quit my business and my job because I really went full time uh
in organizing the opposition against the past regime

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#96:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#97:1:D>
<indig> So nakita ko nang kaya kong mabuhay sa sarili kong ano
maski na </indig> underground economy <indig> o maski </indig> buy and sell

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#98:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#99:1:D>
So <indig> wala na akong takot diyan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#100:1:D>
Kaya lang nakita ko rin itong kapangyarihan </indig> once you 're
in office <indig> pala hindi mo naiisip ito dahil sa dami ng trabahong
ginagawa mo </indig> it 's only when you reflect maybe after I get out of my
office that I will say to myself <indig> uy ang lakas pala ng aking uh
puwesto ang lakas ang dami ko palang kapangyarihan di ko nagamit </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#101:1:D>
<indig> Pero </indig> on the other hand <indig> baka maipagmalaki
ko 'to sapagkat </indig> no one in the family has even benefitted from that
power that I am enjoying right now

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#102:1:B>
What about you General Manager Carrascoso why aren't you
running
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#103:1:B>
You look like uh you can tackle the work of Doc Carrascoso

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#104:1:E>
Basically Jullie my role in government is uh first of all
coterminous with the uh President Aquino

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#105:1:B>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#106:1:B>

 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#107:1:B>
And I gave myself four years to serve the government as if I was
drafted in the army
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#108:1:B>
That 's about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#109:1:B>
I think uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#110:1:B>
You 've had enough of us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#111:1:B>
Or we 've had enough of you <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#112:1:B>

 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#113:1:B>
Well I think uh we should we should uh lead a quieter life and
probably go back to the private sector and <{> <[> <unclear> words </unclear> 
 </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#114:1:B>
<[> What is your biggest frustration </[> </{> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#115:1:E>
Well I think it 's it 's uh trying to please everybody

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#116:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#117:1:E>
And I think uh uh you can't do it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#118:1:E>
And it 's a thankless job
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#119:1:E>
And basically I think uh I have done my part and uh if somebody if
they don't agree with some of my of my policies well I try to my best to
serve

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#120:1:B>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#121:1:B>
I 've always said that anyone who can straighten out the
international airport deserves to be President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#122:1:B>
I don't know if you gentlemen agree but you know that airport is
really the heart of chaos <,> anarchy lack of order lack of discipline lack
of planning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#123:1:B>
You know I 'm talking about the architectural uh requirements that
are not there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#124:1:B>
We 're talking about water not being there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#125:1:B>
We 're talking about doors falling apart and people running in and
out who should not be there

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#126:1:E>
Uh by the way Jullie I 'm the only agency with water and and
power all this <{> <[> this time yeah </]> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#127:1:B>
<[> All the time <indig> ha </indig> </]> </}> you 're sure
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#128:1:B>
Well how did you how did you do that

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#129:1:E>
Well I planned it since last year that I knew that there
would be a lot of problems as far as water and uh power is concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#130:1:E>
And we addressed this problem as early as last year

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#131:1:B>
How did you ensure uh continuous power when the rest of Metro
Manila suffers three to four hour brownouts every day

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#132:1:E>
Well first of all they gave me a priority as far as this is
concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#133:1:E>
But uh there are <.> ta </.> times that we have real emergency
powers over there and uh all of our air-conditionings are now decentralized

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#134:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#135:1:E>
And so I think basically these are the uh the things that we
have done over the years

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#136:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#137:1:E>
And when I leave in June I 'll be leaving the the coffers of
NAIA with one billion pesos

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#138:1:B>
Oh that 's good
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#139:1:B>
Now in the meantime what can you say about Doc uh your brother
seeking an elected office
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#140:1:B>
<.> Di </.> did your family have a meeting a council of some kind

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#141:1:E>
Well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#142:1:B>
To counsel him

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#143:1:E>
I found out that Docky was running when I was on my way back
in Manila and I said well <.> it </.> it 's up to him if he thinks that he
can serve the country on a <.> bet </.> on a different way and I think I wish
him luck
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#144:1:E>
And hopefully he will win

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#145:1:B>
Uh-huh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#146:1:B>
Did uh Doc didn't you try to get Ed to run also for some kind of
an elected office

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#147:1:F>
Uh what is that Jullie

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#148:1:B>
Didn't you try to get him to run

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#149:1:G>
Oh no no no no

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#150:1:B>
<{> <[> To convince him to run </]> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#151:1:G>
<[> Uh we do not try to </]> </}> look into each other 's
lives <indig> 'no </indig> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#152:1:G>
Our late father has taught us that way <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#153:1:G>
To <{> <[> leave each other in peace </]> and maybe we just get
together when we <,> one is one has a problem or one needs help
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#154:1:G>
That is the only time that we get together
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#155:1:G>
But basically you 'll be surprised probably we don't see each
other for about three four months

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#156:1:B>
<[> To each his own </]> </}> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#157:1:B>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#158:1:B>
Is this politics in the blood for for some of you for the
Apacibles
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#159:1:B>
This is your first time

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#160:1:C>
This is my first time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#161:1:C>
The only other politician in the family was my great grandfather
Agapito Zialcita

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#162:1:B>
Whom you you never saw

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#163:1:C>
Who was an original signatory to the Declaration of
Philippine Independence in eighteen ninety-eight
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#164:1:C>
And it stopped there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#165:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#166:1:H>
The rest of the family are professionals doctors engineers
and uh I 'm the only one who 's trying this new thing

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#167:1:D>
In our case uh our late father was a congressman four-termer
he died in office

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#168:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#169:1:D>
So when he died uh <indig> alam mo ganyan ang kaugalian e
kung mapasimulan ng ama pag mamatay gusto 'yong </indig> either <indig> asawa
o anak e wala pa naman ako sa edad 'yong kapatid ko lang ang nasa edad kaya
siya ang lumaban ng </indig> mayor <indig> sa aming bayan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#170:1:D>
And I think he was a uh two termer there or something like that

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#171:1:F>
Three three

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#172:1:D>
Three terms yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-030#173:1:D>
He was one of the most outstanding uh mayors at that time
