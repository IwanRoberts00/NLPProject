<h> <bold> Female traffic aides catching on </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#2:1>
AS FAR as the Metro Manila police chief is concerned, Caloocan
City Mayor Reynaldo Malonzo might have hit on a good idea when he thought of
hiring more female traffic enforcers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#3:1>
Now Chief Supt. Edgar Aglipay is himself seriously considering
fielding women traffic enforcers in the metropolis as a way to solve
corruption in the police ranks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#4:1>
At a meeting yesterday with Aglipay, <indig> Pinagkaisang Samahan
ng Tsuper at </indig> Operators Nationwide ( PISTON) president Medardo Roda
brought up the idea to recruit female traffic enforcers as a way of
discouraging Metro Manila policemen from extorting from public transport
drivers and motorists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#5:1>
Aglipay agreed with Roda 's suggestion and immediately formed a
committee that will find ways of successfully carrying out the plan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#6:1>
Aglipay said <indig> jeepney </indig> drivers and motorists will
be reluctant to bribe female traffic enforcers.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#7:1>
The women enforcers, meanwhile would be hesitant to accept bribes
because <quote> &ldquo; they would be exposed to probing eyes, &rdquo;
</quote> Aglipay said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#8:1>
He said he would still consult Metro Manila Development Authority
( MMDA) Chairman Jejomar Binay on his plan to get his approval. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#9:1>
MMDA Executive Director for Traffic Ernesto Camarillo in fact
welcomes the idea of having more female traffic enforcers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#10:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It appears that lady enforcers are more strict in
traffic enforcement than their counterparts and motorists are less tempted to
bribe them, maybe because they are ashamed to do it to a woman, &rdquo;
</quote> Camarillo said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#11:1>
He said women traffic enforcers have proven to be effective in
Bangkok, Thailand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#12:1>
Camarillo was quick to add that when choosing the woman
enforcers, there should not be <quote> &ldquo; any discriminatory preference
for sexy and pretty ladies over those who are not so sexy and not so pretty.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#13:1>
Malonzo had proposed recruiting good-looking female enforcers,
believing they could have a &ldquo; positive effect &rdquo; on motorists.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#14:1>
The Piston officials were very vocal in complaining to Aglipay
about what they said was rampant extortion by traffic enforcers. </p>

<h> <bold> 5,000 enforcers to control All Saints ' Day Metro traffic
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#17:2>
AT least 5,000 traffic and police personnel will be deployed on
routes leading to 50 key cemeteries in Metro Manila from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3
when Metro Manilans start paying their respects to their departed loved ones.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#18:2>
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority ( MMDA) Traffic
Executive Director Ernesto Camarillo said at least 2,700 traffic personnel
will come from the MMDA. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#19:2>
Another 1,300 will come from the Philippine National Police
Traffic Enforcement Group while at least 1,000 more will be pulled out from
various PNP units, Camarillo said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#20:2>
Of the 50 key cemeteries, Camarillo said, Quezon City has six.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#21:2>
Caloocan City, Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela City and southern
Metro Manila have 17 each while seven are in the eastern part of the
metropolis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#22:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Manila only has three big and old cemeteries, but
these greatly affect ( traffic on) two major thoroughfares linking the north
and south of the metropolis, Rizal Ave. Extension and A. Bonifacio, &rdquo;
</quote> Camarillo said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#23:2>
Camarillo said traffic personnel will also be deployed at the
North and South Luzon tollways where two memorial parks, Eternal Gardens and
Manila Memorial, are located. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#24:2>
He said traffic to and from Manila Memorial sometimes stretch all
the way to the Sucat interchange at the South Luzon Tollway during All Saints '
Day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#25:2>
Another memorial park which is a known chokepoint is Loyola
Memorial Park in <indig> Barangay </indig> Barangka in Marikina, Camarillo
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#26:2>
It may be recalled that it was in Loyola Park wherein a pregnant
woman was shot dead during a parking quarrel on All Saints ' Day last year.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#27:2>
Camarillo said streets in the vicinity of cemeteries will be
totally closed to traffic while one-way vehicular flow will only be allowed
on adjacent streets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#28:2>
Parking areas will be designated at the vacant spot nearest to
cemeteries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#29:2>
Camarillo said the MMDA has talked with bus operators for added
units to accommodate the scores of people who are expected to troop to
cemeteries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#30:2>
On top of all these, Camarillo said the vehicular color-coding
scheme will not be suspended. </p>

<h> <bold> Gov't borrows &dollar;200M for Pasig rehab </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#33:3>
<bold> Pearl O. Bantillo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#34:3>
The national government borrowed another &dollar;200 million from
international creditors to bridge finance the cleaning up of the Pasig River.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#35:3>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu told reporters that the
&dollar;200 million is an additional issue on the &dollar;1 billion bonds
floated last month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#36:3>
Espiritu said that the &dollar;200 million new bonds will mature
in 20 years.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#37:3>
The &dollar;1 billion bond earlier floated was halved into 10 and
20-year maturities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#38:3>
Espirirtu said the latest borrowing got <quote> &ldquo; better
spread than the first one or lower by 55 basis points. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#39:3>
Espiritu again said that the country 's easy access to commercial
borrowers prove that it is creditworthy.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#40:3>
The proceeds are expected to come in on February 16. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#41:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The transaction demonstrates the ability of the
Republic to successfully reopen an existing benchmark, appealing to investor
demand for liquidity amidst continued volatility in the emerging markets.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#42:3>
The issue was joint lead managed and bookrun by JP Morgan, Morgan
Stanley and Warburg Dillon Read. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#43:3>
The &dollar;200 million was priced on Monday at 100.75 at a lower
yield of 9.787 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#44:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The re-opening was executed quickly and quietly,
taking advantage of an attractive window of opportunity amidst a volatile
market. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#45:3>
Espiritu said the &dollar;200 million will finance the relocation
of squatters, dredging and cleaning up the river. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#46:3>
The proceeds from the bond float will bridge finance the loans
from Asian Development Bank ( ADB) intended for the Pasig River Development
Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#47:3>
Espiritu noted that the re-opening of the 20 year global bond
offering was made to cover the &dollar;250 million expected earlier to come
from the blue chip shares of NG in Manila Electric Co. ( Meralco). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#48:3>
<quote> &ldquo; This would replace the exchangeable bonds from
MERALCO. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#49:3>
NG was hoping to get &dollar;250 million from issuing convertible
bond against its 10 percent stake in Manila Electric Co. ( Meralco).

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#50:3>
The plan was stalled because some issues are still needed to be
straightened out regarding the passage of the Omnibus Electric bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#51:3>
NG is engaging in active borrowing to service its maturing
obligations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#52:3>
The Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the <indig> Bangko
Central ng Pilipinas </indig> ( BSP), has given the national government the
authority to source some &dollar;2 billion funds from the international
capital markets.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#53:3>
The underlying bond in the &dollar;2 billion include the &dollar;500
million global bond with 10 year maturity, another &dollar;500 million global
bond with 20 year maturity and the &dollar;500 million euro bond to be
floated in March. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#54:3>
Espiritu, however, maintained that NG is still targeting for a
&dollar;500 million bond offering this March. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#55:3>
He said that NG asked for a &dollar;500 million leeway to adjust
its offering just in case the need arises to source more funds from the
international capital market. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Shell may shut down Pililla oil refinery </bold> </h>

PILILLA, Rizal. -

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#59:4>
Pilipinas Shell Corp. may have to shut down its base oil refinery
here as demand continues to weaken and competitor 's price drops. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#60:4>
Sebastian Quiniones, refinery manager of Shell Philippine
Petroleum Corp. ( SPPC), said that there is an oversupply of base oil in the
Asian region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#61:4>
Despite having stopped operations for two months from December to
January, Quiniones said there remains a supply glut. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#62:4>
There is a world supply glut and it is not helping that Singapore
with its more efficient and modern refineries is cutting prices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#63:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Total demand in the local and international
markets are way, way down. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#64:4>
Quiniones said total demand, in terms of volume, for lubricants,
one of the key by-products of base oil aside from asphalt, has dropped by 15
percent last year from 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#65:4>
In 1998, total demand for the refinery 's base oil was only at
110,000 tons of barrel.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#66:4>
The maximum capacity of the plant is 170,000 tons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#67:4>
Last month, SPPC reported total base oil demand of only 10,000
tons.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#68:4>
Quiniones said the refinery can only accommodate a minimum demand of
90,000 tons in a year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#69:4>
<quote> &ldquo; <mention> Shut down </mention> is a very bad
word, but we may be forced to do it again if total demand continues to be low
relative to our supply.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#70:4>
We can only pray that things improve this year.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#71:4>
There 's always a chance to close, we hope the economy will rebound,
&rdquo; </quote> the SPPC official mused.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#72:4>
<quote> &ldquo; We can't do anything about the excess capacity ( of
base oil).

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#73:4>
They 're just wasted. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#74:4>
SPPC is the only local supplier of base oil.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#75:4>
As such, it has an absolute monopoly of the total asphalt
requirements of the country, providing about 70 percent of the total. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#76:4>
Among its customers are the other large oil companies and some of
the leading construction firms in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#77:4>
However, if the persisting repressed demand forces SPPC to close
shop, the country will need about &dollar;32 million to import its base
requirements.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#78:4>
SPPC has provided the country about &dollar;17 million in earnings
from its exportation of base oil products and by-products. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> PAL eyes tie-ups with other airlines </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#80:5>
The Philippine Airlines is eyeing joint-service tie-ups with
American and European airlines and sharing franchise with local airlines.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#81:5>
PAL chief company adviser Peter Foster said yesterday these steps
are part of the ongoing reforms in PAL and under its revised rehabilitation
plan due for submission by mid-March. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#82:5>
The tie-ups and code sharing will improve PAL 's route structure,
geographical reach and product offerings, Foster said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#83:5>
PAL is currently talking to a number of US carriers about forging
joint-service agreements on the important trans-Pacific routes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#84:5>
PAL is the only airline operating non-stop services between
Manila and the major US West Coast gateway of Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#85:5>
<quote> &ldquo; A tie-up with a US carrier would enhance PAL 's
position in terms of feed from other points in the US, as well as
frequent-flyer benefits for US-originating passengers, &rdquo; </quote> noted
Foster. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#86:5>
PAL has also opened discussions with a number of European
carriers regarding similar joint-service arrangements between Manila and
Europe, which could involve the use of PAL aircraft, Foster added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#87:5>
In the domestic scene, PAL is seriously considering the adoption
of a franchise system with one or more local carriers in which the latter
would operate some of the minor routes not currently serviced by PAL. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#88:5>
The franchise scheme, which is similar to existing arrangements
among European and US carriers, offers substantial benefits for all parties
concerned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#89:5>
<quote> &ldquo; The smaller carriers benefit from having their
services sold to a wider audience via the world-wide distribution and
marketing network of PAL.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#90:5>
On the other hand, PAL will have an expanded network of routes to
sell, &rdquo; </quote> explained Foster. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#91:5>
In the end, the riding public benefits from the arrangement by
gaining more services to domestic destinations that would not otherwise be
served by local carriers, the PAL executive added. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Creditors want new investors in Victorias </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#93:6>
Creditors of Victorias Milling Co. are insisting that a new set
of investors run the company. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#94:6>
The 32 creditor banks said that current shareholders should give
up control as this is the only way to bring back Victorias to its feet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#95:6>
Philippine Commercial International Bank executive vice-president
and Victorias management committee chairman Isidro Alcantara said that the
banks wanted an auction for Victorias, otherwise they back off from the
rehabilitation plan which includes the conversion of &peso;1.5 billion of the
bank 's exposure in VMC into equity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#96:6>
<quote> &ldquo; The creditors have made it clear from the very
start that they will convert into equity if equity is auctioned off.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#97:6>
This is to maximize the inflows to the company and to make it more
transparent, &rdquo; </quote> Alcantara said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#98:6>
He noted that there is a move from VMC 's management to retain
control of the sugar mill through an exercise of pre-emptive rights in the
bidding process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#99:6>
Alcantara said Victorias president Manuel Ma&ntilde;alac should
join the public bidding if he has enough funds to compete with the interested
investors in VMC. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#100:6>
In an event that Ma&ntilde;alac managed to retain control of the

Sen. Rodolfo Biazon yesterday proposed that the cash incentive
given to recipients of the AFP Medal of Valor ( MOV), the highest award given
to a Filipino soldier, be raised from &peso;200 monthly to &peso;10,000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#103:7>
Biazon also urged additional discount privileges; and free
medical and dental services and consultation in government or private
hospitals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#104:7>
Biazon also recommended penal sanctions for any person who shall

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-008#105:7>
He said that while awardees or his heirs are entitled to
