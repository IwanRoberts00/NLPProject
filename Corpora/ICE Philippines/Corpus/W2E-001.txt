<h> <bold> Sequel to the Revolution </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#2:1>
TODAY is the centennial of the outbreak of the Filipino-American
War.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#3:1>
Nearly forgotten in the history of the 1896 Philippine Revolution,
that war is the last of the watershed events being commemorated in the
Centennial of the First Republic before the celebration officially ends in
April. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#4:1>
Filipino historians, including Prof. Jose V. Abueva who wrote
about the <quote> &ldquo; forgotten war &rdquo; </quote> in the <mention>
INQUIRER </mention> 's In Depth section last Sunday, have pointed out that
the Filipino-American War was the second phase of the Revolution.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#5:1>
That phase came after the United States invaded the Philippines at a
time when the revolutionary army had driven the Spanish forces to the edge of
collapse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#6:1>
The American military intervention reinforced by the signing on
Dec. 19, 1898 of the Treaty of Paris, in which Spain ceded its colony to the
United States, cheated the Filipinos of the fruits of their armed struggle to
win independence from Spain, and ignited the fuse that exploded into the
Filipino-American War, which started with the battle of San Juan Bridge on
Feb. 4, 1899. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#7:1>
Historical accounts seeking to justify the US intervention and
annexation of the Philippines tend to blur the importance of the
Filipino-American War as a sequel to the aborted Revolution and, worse, to
denigrate the war as an <mention> &ldquo; insurrection &rdquo; </mention> by
Filipino bandits so as to maintain the legal fiction that the Americans
annexed the Philippines by right of an international treaty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#8:1>
Two historical facts stand out in the San Juan Bridge &ldquo;
incident. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#9:1>
The first is that the American sentries on their side of the bridge
fired the first shot.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#10:1>
The American sentries were itching to fire their guns.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#11:1>
They had received orders to fire at any Filipino sighted in <indig>
Santol </indig> district, the no man 's land between Filipino and American
lines posted on opposite ends of the bridge.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#12:1>
The racist overtones of the American action were expressed by an
American soldier who after the first shot that felled Filipinos said, <quote>
&ldquo; Line up fellows; the niggers are in here all through these yards.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#13:1>
The incident which the Americans provoked was the spark that
speeded the ratification in the US Senate of the Treaty of Paris by a
majority of one vote.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#14:1>
The outbreak of the war was the catalyst in the conversion of the
Revolution from the war for independence from Spain into a war to defend that
freedom from American intervention.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#15:1>
It was the most decisive critical element that galvanized most of the
revolutionary forces scattered in the archipelago behind the Malolos Republic 's
declaration of the war of independence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#16:1>
Before the American intervention, the Malolos government only had
lukewarm support from Filipino revolutionaries in a number of provinces where
regional separatist or autonomy tendencies were strong.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#17:1>
The war against the Americans impressed upon the Filipinos a strong
sense of national solidarity behind a common cause.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#18:1>
The enemy was no longer Spain; it was the United States. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#19:1>
A long, bloody war

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#20:1>
ANY attempt to belittle that second phase of the Revolution
crumbles in the face of evidence that the war lasted from 1899 to 1906, the
date the last Filipino general, Macario Sakay was captured; that Filipino
resistance was fierce; that by 1901, there were 120,000 American troops
deployed in the islands; and that there were widespread devastation, heavy
casualties and large-scale decimation of the population. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#21:1>
The resistance lasted for seven years--longer than the Revolution
against Spain, from 1896 to 1899.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#22:1>
It was more fierce than the Filipino resistance to the Japanese
invasion and occupation--a fact that has been played down by the so-called
<mention> &ldquo; benevolent assimilation &rdquo; </mention> aspect of the
American pacification campaign. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#23:1>
The Malolos Republic itself, inaugurated in January 1899, was
short-lived.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#24:1>
Facing superior American forces, President Emilio Aguinaldo 's
government took flight from Malolos in March and transferred the capital to
San Isidro, Nueve Ecija.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#25:1>
Then he retreated farther north to Palanan, Isabela, where he was
captured on Sept. 6, 1900. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#26:1>
But Aguinaldo 's capture did not end the war.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#27:1>
Pockets of guerrilla resistance continued until one by one the
revolutionary generals surrendered or were arrested. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#28:1>
It is therefore fitting that the centennial of the
Filipino-American War has been given fuller recognition as not just a
footnote of revolutionary history but as a defining event leading to the next
phase of Filipino co-optation into the establishment of civil government in
the Philippines. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Magic Potion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#30:2>
DESPERATION seems to be written all over it, but at least some
local governments and plain folks are doing something to banish the scourge
that health officials still can't bring themselves to call an epidemic, much
less tackle with the urgency it deserves.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#31:2>
As of the latest count, dengue fever has afflicted 13,024 people
since the beginning of the year, killing 236 of them.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#32:2>
Those figures most certainly understates the problem, given that most
Filipinos are not in the habit of rushing to doctors until it is almost too
late.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#33:2>
But other than compiling records, Department of Health officials seem
to have done little more than wring their hands in frustration, leaving
others to deal with the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#34:2>
In Quezon City, which has been identified as one of the <mention>
&ldquo; dengue hot spots, &rdquo; </mention> a councilor has proposed the
suspension of classes for a week to allow government workers to fumigate
campuses and surrounding areas.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#35:2>
The objective is not bad at all: keep the schools safe for children
who are especially vulnerable to the disease by eradicating the
dengue-carrying mosquitoes, which bite in the daytime.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#36:2>
Health authorities have pointed out, however, that killing the
mosquitoes may not be the most effective way of stopping the spread of the
disease since it would spare the larvae that thrive in stagnant waters.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#37:2>
But at least it takes care of one-half of the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#38:2>
In Pangasinan where at least 15 persons have been killed by
dengue fever, civic leaders have organized <quote> &ldquo; walking blood
banks &rdquo; </quote> to provide safe and hopefully adequate sources of
blood for patients needing transfusion.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#39:2>
There are no blood banks in the province, and buying blood from
Manila takes at least two days, a delay that could be fatal in some cases.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#40:2>
Thus, officials of the Lyceum-Northwestern Educational Institution
thought of keeping a list of healthy individuals who are willing to donate
blood when needed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#41:2>
The idea couldn't be any better.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#42:2>
Fresh blood or fresh plasma is best for hemorrhagic fever, according
to doctors.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#43:2>
Besides there can hardly be any better place for storing blood than
right in the bloodstream of the donors themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#44:2>
The only problem is whether there will be enough <quote> &ldquo;
walking blood banks &rdquo; </quote> to supply the needs of patients
afflicted with H-fever. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#45:2>
Most interesting are the reportedly successful treatment of
dengue patients with a brew made from boiling a herb that Cebuanos call
<mention> <it> mangagaw </it> </mention> or <mention> <it> busikad </it>
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#46:2>
A health official in Cebu City said a number of parents have come
forward to claim their children had been cured of dengue after drinking
several glasses of the herbal brew.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#47:2>
One of them was a 4-year-old boy who was pale and weak and bleeding
through his mouth and nose that doctors said he needed a blood transfusion.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#48:2>
In desperation, his parents took the advice of a friend who
recommended that they make him drink <it> mangagaw </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#49:2>
Six hours after the child downed a glass of the brew, he was feeling
well and asking for food. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#50:2>
Is this the cure for H-fever that doctors have been seeking?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#51:2>
The parents swear the herbal medicine worked like a miracle on their
sick children.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#52:2>
But city health officials are not about to endorse it yet, saying
there is yet no scientific evidence proving its potency.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#53:2>
They have sent samples of the herb to the University of the
Philippines in Los Ba&ntilde;os for analysis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#54:2>
Experts have said it would take at least five years to develop a
vaccine against dengue.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#55:2>
If the native herbal cure proves effective, it would be a major
breakthrough in the campaign against dengue not only in the Philippines but
in many other tropical countries all over the world. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#56:2>
<h> <bold> Food of the future </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#57:2>
TO MANY old folks ( and some who are not so old), papaya has two
distinct characteristics.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#58:2>
First, it helps people who are encountering difficulties with their
daily ( toilet) ritual.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#59:2>
Second, it is what Hillary Clinton should have fed US President Bill
Clinton from the first time they met. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#60:2>
There may be a firm basis for the first, but the second seems to
rest on shaky grounds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#61:2>
A Russian molecular biologist, Dr. Ludmila Korkina, said
Philippine papaya has a higher nutritional level than food supplements given
to cosmonauts during simulated space flights.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#62:2>
Cosmonauts who ate papaya were found to be better able to maintain
their physical, psychological and emotional well-being under stressful
conditions, Korkina told the 46th International Congress on Aviation and
Space Medicine in Singapore last week.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#63:2>
Aside from showing improved ability to combat physical, mental and
emotional fatigue, the same cosmonauts also showed better eye-hand
coordination and improved waking capacities than those who were fed a
different diet.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#64:2>
This makes papaya a <quote> &ldquo; functional food &rdquo; </quote>
and the food of the next millennium, she said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#65:2>
But why are these properties found only in Philippine papaya?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#66:2>
That ought to be the subject of further research. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Study </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#68:3>
WE thought President Estrada hired a spokesperson precisely to
avoid problems of the sort.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#69:3>
That was the reason Malaca&ntilde;ang specifically cited for bringing
in Fernando Barican.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#70:3>
He was there to make sure the President recovered from his
foot-in-mouth disease - - that is, from his penchant for making off-the-cuff
remarks that put him in a bad light with the press.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#71:3>
Henceforth, Barican was to issue the official statements and meet
with the reporters.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#72:3>
That was the idea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#73:3>
But barely had Barican warmed his seat when the same problem came
back to haunt Malaca&ntilde;ang, and with a vengeance.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#74:3>
In but two days, Mr. Estrada ended up being corrected no less than
three times by his own people. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#75:3>
First, Mr. Estrada said that the talks with the <indig> Moro
</indig> Islamic Liberation Front had been suspended in the light of the
kidnapping of Italian priest Luciano Beneditti.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#76:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Unless we get the victim, &rdquo; </quote> he told
reporters at Camp Crame, <quote> &ldquo; we don't resume negotiations.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#77:3>
Not so, his security advisers said.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#78:3>
They were still hard at work negotiating with the MILF.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#79:3>
They denied ever recommending that talks be suspended on account of
the kidnappings in the South. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#80:3>
Next, Mr. Estrada expressed optimism about the peace and order
situation in the South.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#81:3>
The number of kidnappings was nothing to be alarmed about, he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#82:3>
It merely indicated that the kin of the victims were now more willing
to report their abduction and cooperate with the police.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#83:3>
Not so, said Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#84:3>
The kidnappings were a cause for alarm, indicating as they did that
criminal elements were testing the President 's resolve in fighting crime.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#85:3>
And finally, dismayed by the charges of corruption the ombudsman
and his second-in-command were hurling at each other, Mr. Estrada told
reporters he would summon the two and try to settle the dispute between them.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#86:3>
It wasn't good for the country 's anti-corruption campaign, he said,
that the highest officials of the anti-graft body would accuse each other of
the one thing they were sworn to rid the country of.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#87:3>
Not so, said Barican.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#88:3>
The President may not summon the officials of an independent body.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#89:3>
Mr. Estrada hastened to explain that his utterances might not
always be construed as policy.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#90:3>
That excuse is worse than the thing it is meant to justify.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#91:3>
We can understand that when the President talks about the weather, he
is not talking policy, though in these days of El Ni&ntilde;o and La
Ni&ntilde;a, you can't even be sure about that.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#92:3>
We can understand that when the President talks about the relative
virtues of <foreign> karaokes </foreign> , he is not talking about policy.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#93:3>
But we cannot understand why when the President talks about
negotiations with the MILF, the state of peace and order in the South, and
the corruption charges made by Deputy Ombudsman Francisco Villa against
Ombudsman Aniano Desierto, he cannot possibly be talking about policy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#94:3>
Coordination, or getting their act together, will help.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#95:3>
But even that has its limits.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#96:3>
The problem is not just that the President isn't coordinating with
his people.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#97:3>
It is that the President isn't studying his lessons.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#98:3>
When you are the president, you <it> must </it> know you cannot
meddle in the affairs of a constitutionally mandated body.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#99:3>
The President has pleaded for understanding and tolerance from the
press and the public as he is new in his job.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#100:3>
That the press and the public can easily give.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#101:3>
But they must plead as well that he show respect and devotion to
that office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#102:3>
Teachers may be able to abide intellectually challenged pupils
who show diligence and industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-001#103:3>
But they may never be able to do so for goof-offs who keep asking
for passing grades. </p> </I>
