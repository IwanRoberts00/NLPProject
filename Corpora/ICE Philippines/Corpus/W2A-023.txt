<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#4:1>
<it> Influenza is endemic in the Philippines occasionally flaring
up in sharp periodic outbreaks.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#5:1>
The National Intelligence Health Service of the Philippine Health
Department has consistently listed it as one of the top three leading causes
of morbidity among Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#6:1>
Pandemic influenza is attributed to the ability of the influenza A
virus to undergo antigenic drift and antigenic shift resulting in new
subtypes which escape the neutralizing effect of antibodies induced by
previous infections or vaccination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#7:1>
Genetic reassortment and recombination between human and animal
influenza viruses have also given rise to new subtypes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#8:1>
Surveillance among human and animal populations to monitor currently
circulating strains and to detect emerging variants is therefore important in
determining correct control measures including the appropriate composition of
influenza vaccines to be produced for the current season.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#9:1>
Extensive serological studies are needed to determine the ecology of
human and animal influenza viruses in the Philippines, and phylogenetic
studies of more recent isolates may help trace the evolution of some local
strains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#10:1>
A review of literature showed the lack of current information on
influenza in the Philippines and this all the more emphasizes the need to
conduct new researches on the virus and its epidemiology in the local
setting. </it> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#11:1>
<h> <bold> History and epidemiology </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#12:1>
Influenza has been responsible for pandemics, epidemics,
localized outbreaks as well as sporadic cases resulting in excess deaths and
substantial mobidity. <fnr> <sp> 1,2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#13:1>
Epidemics that were probably influenza have been reported throughout
recorded history.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#14:1>
As early as 1170 and 1500 in England, mention has already been made
in the medical literature of epidemics of a disease similar to influenza.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#15:1>
But it was only in 1510 that a more authentic epidemic has been
described.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#16:1>
Since then up to the 19th century, 11 influenza pandemics ( those of
1510, 1559, 1580, 1593, 1729, 1788, 1830, 1833, 1836, 1847, and 1889) have
been documented. <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#17:1>
In the 20th century there have already been 4 pandemics ( 1918/19,
1957/58, 1968/69 and 1977).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#18:1>
The great pandemic of 1918/19 caused an estimated 20 million deaths.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#19:1>
Between pandemics usually there have been epidemics of varying
severity at intervals of one to three years and a trickle of sporadic cases
every winter. <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#20:1>
In the United States during the 1954 epidemic, 70,000 deaths were
attributed to the Asian strain circulating at the time.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#21:1>
Between 1957 to 1986 the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC) in
Atlanta, Georgia, documented more than 10,000 excess deaths in each of the 19
epidemics in the USA, with more than 40,000 deaths in several of them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#22:1>
In the Philippines the first recorded influenza outbreak occurred
in 1918 in Manila and nearby provinces ( Bataan, Bulacan, Batangas, Rizal,
Laguna, Tayabas ( now Quezon), Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#23:1>
The period of April to July of that year saw a high morbidity rate
but only slight mortality of the affected populations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#24:1>
However, in the second phase of the epidemic ( October to December),
mortality was established at 2.5 to 3% ( 71 243 deaths) in the provinces.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#25:1>
In Manila there was an average of 843 cases per day at the height of
the epidemic, and there were 3.85 deaths per 1000 population.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#26:1>
In 1957, heightened influenza activity was again observed starting in
April, peaking in May, and finally subsiding in June.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#27:1>
During the period of the epidemic, 10,306 cases were reported with
216 deaths.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#28:1>
<fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr> Complement-fixation test and
hemagglutination-inhibition test results of specimens taken from clinically
diagnosed influenza patients at that time were highly suggestive of a type A
( A/PR8/34 and A/FMI/47) influenza infection. <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#29:1>
A similar serological evaluation of specimens collected during a
reported 1960-61 outbreak in Manila also showed 11 of 35 paired samples
having a significant antibody titre rise against A/Phil/57. <fnr> <sp> 7
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#30:1>
Isolation of the A/Victoria/3/75 strain of influenza virus and
serological testing of unpaired sera documented the influenza outbreak during
June to August of 1975. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#31:1>
<h> <bold> Antigenic drift and antigenic shift </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#32:1>
Although the last severe pandemic was over 20 years ago,
influenza remains an important viral epidemic disease because of its
potential to return to its former magnitude. <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#33:1>
A major concern is the rapidity with which epidemics evolve because
of the influenza A virus ' ability to undergo antigenic shift and antigenic
drift resulting in new strains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#34:1>
Influenza virus B mutates at a much lesser degree. <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp>
</fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#35:1>
Emergence of new subtypes and their introduction to a nonimmune
population results in universal susceptibility. <fnr> <sp> 1,10 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#36:1>
It has therefore become imperative to establish an extensive
surveillance system for influenza.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#37:1>
The World Health Organization ( WHO) Influenza Surveillance Programme
has long been a model of international collaboration and rapid exchange of
information as will be discussed later.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#38:1>
Influenza surveillance not only provides an assessment of the real
impact of outbreaks but also enables the identification of currently
circulating variants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#39:1>
This is especially important since new variants with different
antigenic determinants can escape the neutralizing antibodies that were
developed through previous vaccinations or infections.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#40:1>
Thus, in vaccine production, some strains are changed every one or
two years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#41:1>
The influenza virus is classified under Family <foreign>
Orthomyxoviridae </foreign> , Genus Influenzavirus with Species
Influenzavirus A and Influenzavirus B, and probable Genus Influenzavirus C
with Species Influenzavirus C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#42:1>
It is a pleomorphic or filamentous virion with a diameter of 80 to
120 nm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#43:1>
From the exterior surface of the lipid envelope project the
rod-shaped <it> hemagglutinin </it> ( H) and the mushroom-shaped <it>
neuraminidase </it> ( N) peplomers, both of which carry the subtype-specific
antigenic determinants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#44:1>
The genome occurs as 8 separate molecules and reassortment of the
genes in the 8 RNA segments for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gives rise to
<it> antigenic shift </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#45:1>
In antigenic shift there is a change of the epidemic strain to a
virus having hemagglutinin of a subtype different from previously prevalent
strains. <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#46:1>
The emergence of completely new subtypes due to this antigenic shift,
and which appear at irregular intervals, are responsible for the pandemics.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#47:1>
More gradual antigenic variations or mutations within each
subtype is known as antigenic drift. <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#48:1>
These continuous minor antigenic changes in the strains are
responsible for interpandemic epidemics. <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#49:1>
Results of sub-typing influenza A viruses by immunodiffusion has
indicated the presence of 12 hemagglutinin subtypes ( designated as H1 to
H12) and 9 neuraminidase subtypes ( N1 to N9) as based on the 1980 system.
<fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#50:1>
However, Ghendon describes 13 H subtypes identified in man and
several animal species. <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#51:1>
Influenza A viruses are responsible for widespread epidemics while
the influenza B viruses, which are not differentiated into subtypes, are
responsible mainly for localized outbreaks and the resulting mortality is not
quite as high as with the A viruses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#52:1>
Influenza C viruses are also not differentiated into subtypes and are
rarely isolated from epidemics or outbreaks.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#53:1>
Based on serosurveys C viruses are known to infect the majority of
persons during childhood causing a mild illness resembling the common cold.
<fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#54:1>
Only influenza A viruses are known to infect species other than man
and are responsible for epizootics of swine influenza, equine influenza, and
avian influenza ( also called fowl plague). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#55:1>
Theoretically, any combination of H and N is possible but only
limited ranges of subtypes have actually been found in each species of
animal. <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#56:1>
For human influenza viruses, a large number of antigenically
distinguishable strains have been identified for the H1, H2, H3, and N1 and
N2 subtypes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#57:1>
Nomenclature of influenza virus strains include: ( 1) the letter A,
B, or C ( to describe the virus species), ( 2) the animal species ( except
for isolates from man), ( 3) the geographic location of the isolation, ( 4) a
serial number, and ( 5) for influenza A virus, the subtype of hemagglutinin
and neuraminidase are added in parenthesis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#58:1>
Final comparison of the relationship of isolates to reference strains
within each subtype ( A) or within each type ( B and C) is done by HI and NI
using highly specific sera from animals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#59:1>
Some examples of reference strains are : A/Singapore/6/86 ( H1N1),
A/Singapore/1/57 ( H2N2), A/Port Chalmers/1/77 ( H3N2), B/Panama/45/90, C/Ann
Arbor/1/50, A/swine/New Jersey/8/76 ( H1N1), and A/equine2/Berlin/5/89 (
H3N8). <fnr> <sp> 1-2,9 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#60:1>
The clinical manifestation of the disease in man is similar
whether it is caused by the influenzavirus A, B or C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#61:1>
Serological tests are needed to establish etiologic diagnosis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#62:1>
However, influenza A viruses have been implicated in widespread
epidemics with excess mortality, the B viruses with localized outbreaks and
with mortality not quite as high as with the A viruses, and the C virus is
rarely isolated from epidemics and outbreaks but is known to infect the
majority of persons during childhood causing a mild illness resembling the
common cold. <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#63:1>
Influenza in man is characterized by fever, chilliness, headache,
myalgia, prostration, coryza and mild sore throat.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#64:1>
Cough is severe and protracted.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#65:1>
It is usually limited and recovery can be expected in 2 to 7 days.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#66:1>
Death is usually due to pneumonia and/or the exacerbation of
cardiopulmonary and other conditions. <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#67:1>
Virological surveillance reveals that analogues of
A/Philippines/2/82 ( H3N2) were isolated from different parts of the world (
such as Finland, Czechoslovakia, USSR ( Leningrad), USA ( New York), and
Papua New Guinea) including the Philippines during the period 1980 to 1985.
<fnr> <sp> 13-21 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#68:1>
The biological activities of this variant ( or its recombinant
forms), as demonstrated by <it> <foreign> in vitro </foreign> </it> studies,
may indicate a rather high level of pathogenicity. <fnr> <sp> 22-24 </sp>
</fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#69:1>
A case of a pregnant woman who died from pneumonia caused by
influenza ( A/Philippines/2/82) has been reported. <fnr> <sp> 25 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#70:1>
The influenza ( A/Philippines/2/82) strain was incorporated in the
1984-1985 human and animal influenza vaccine formulations and was determined
to elicit satisfactory antibody response with minimal side effects. <fnr>
<sp> 14,26-36 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#71:1>
Figure 1 illustrates the theory of the &ldquo; recycling &rdquo;
of the human influenza A virus whereby the three subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and
H3N2, seem to emerge in succession in more or less periodic intervals. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#72:1>
<h> <bold> A unique zoonosis </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#73:1>
By definition a zoonosis is a disease that is transmissible from
animals to man and <foreign> vice versa </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#74:1>
The influenza A virus does not simply directly infect man and
animals; most pandemic strains or new subtypes have been found to emerge from
genetic reassortment between subtypes in animal hosts and human viruses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#75:1>
Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that aquatic birds are the
primordial source of all influenza viruses in other species, and that pigs
serve as intermediate hosts in the genetic exchange between influenza viruses
in avian and human species. <fnr> <sp> 37-39 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#76:1>
The earliest known influenza viruses were those of the fowl
plague viruses but their relationship to human influenza virus was not yet
known at the time.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#77:1>
Antigenic analysis of many isolates of animal influenza viruses have
shown that among avian isolates, H and N antigens exist that cross-react with
each of the subtypes found for human influenza viruses, e. g. A/Hong
Kong/1/68 ( H3N2) reacting with A/duck/Germany/1215 ( H3N2), or
A/Japan/305/57 ( H2N2) reacting with A/turkey/Mass/3740/65 ( H6N2). <fnr>
<sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#78:1>
Avian influenza is worldwide and reported outbreaks had occurred in
chickens, turkeys, ducks, pheasants, quails, pigeons, geese and various wild
species.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#79:1>
All 13 H subtypes and all 9 N subtypes of the virus have been
isolated in all species of birds. <fnr> <sp> 12 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#80:1>
Substantial economic losses are incurred during an epizootic in a
commercial farm due to high mortality rate, drastic drop in egg production,
and costs of control measures including depopulation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#81:1>
For example, the Pennsylvania and Virginia epidemics of 1983-84,
caused by subtype H5N2, resulted in the slaughter of over 17 million birds
costing approximately 40 million US dollars in indemnity. <fnr> <sp> 12,40
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#82:1>
Mixed infections of birds with several subtypes may occur, leading to
recombination. <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#83:1>
Avian influenza is characterized mainly by respiratory signs but the
disease signs range from only a slight decrease in egg production or
fertility to a high fatal fulminating infection.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#84:1>
In severely affected hosts, cyanosis and edema of the head, comb and
wattle with blood-stained oral and nasal discharges are common.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-023#85:1>
Sinusitis is not uncommon in ducks, quail and turkeys. <fnr> <sp> 41
