The title of my lecture is Jose Rizal 's philosophy of religion or the religious debate between Rizal and Fr Pastels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#2:1:A>
We can distinguish the philosophy of religion from theology or what I will call theology proper
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#3:1:A>
According to William and Mabel <?> Sahakian </?> <quote> philosophy of religion is the study on the basis of reason nature or scientific facts of the existence and nature of God <,> the existence and nature of the soul the question of immortality and the question of natural evils <,> </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#4:1:A>
Closely related to the last are the issues on miracles and the validity of prayers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#5:1:A>
These are the dominant topics of this branch of philosophy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#6:1:A>
The philosophy of religion is otherwise called natural theology or general theology
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#7:1:A>
Theology proper on the other hand studies God on the basis of the existence of holy books <,> like the Koran or the Bible
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#8:1:A>
It is otherwise called dogmatic theology revealed theology or special theology
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#9:1:A>
In the case of Christianity theology <.> the </.> theology deals with subjects like Christology the study of Jesus as the Christ <?> sotereology </?> the study of salvation of the soul and eschatology the study of the end of the world among others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#10:1:A>
These two types of theology do not necessarily conflict with each other because philosophy can be the handmaiden of theology
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#11:1:A>
Philosophy or reason can help explain or enlighten the dogmas of religion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#12:1:A>
Where on occasion the possibility of a conflict looms then the parting of the ways may arise
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#13:1:A>
A number of thinkers have decided to become agnostics like <.> Bert </.> Bertrand Russell or atheists like Rudolf Carnap
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#14:1:A>
The other possible way is simply to abandon reason when the conflict becomes imminent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#15:1:A>
The basic assumption here is that God can be known only if He reveals Himself to man through some divinely inspired individuals who thereby penned down these divine revelations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#16:1:A>
Reason can help in making the revelations understandable to the man on the street
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#17:1:A>
But reason is not entitled to contradict them since they are assumed infallible
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#18:1:A>
Otherwise reason has to be discarded and in all likelihood that part of the revelation where reason fails to elaborate may be considered a mystery
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#19:1:A>
Saint Thomas Aguinas differentiates the objects of reason and of faith
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#20:1:A>
In the natural world it is impossible to know and to believe a thing at the same time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#21:1:A>
The object of the intellect is knowable while the object of faith is unknowable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#22:1:A>
The purpose of this paper is to examine critically the religious philosophy of Jose Rizal as he expresses them in his correspondence with Fr Pablo Pastels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#23:1:A>
These are the mature religious ideas of Rizal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#24:1:A>
The correspondence consists of eight letters four each by Rizal and Pastels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#25:1:A>
It began in September eighteen ninety-two just a few months after Rizal was banished to Dapitan on seven July eighteen ninety-two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#26:1:A>
By this time most of Rizal 's major and minor works had already been published
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#27:1:A>
The exchange of letters necessarily touched on some philosophical and theological issues because it is the correspondence between a philosopher Rizal and a theologian Fr Pastels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#28:1:A>
Rizal has written a number of works which contain religious ideas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#29:1:A>
It is a subject of controversy as to whether he believes in all or simply in just a few of them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#30:1:A>
Most of these religious views are <.> ex </.> expressed through Rizal 's characters in novels or dialogues
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#31:1:A>
Some of them were written with a presupposed contextual background and they may not truly reflect Rizal 's own religious convictions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#33:1:A>
Eugene Hazel enumerates the works which contain Rizal 's religious thoughts <foreign> Noli Me Tangere </foreign> <foreign> El Filibusterismo </foreign> Rizal 's annotations of Antonio de Morga 's <foreign> Sucesos de Las Islas Filipinas </foreign> The Vision of Friar Rodriguez <,> the open letter entitled My Young Country Women of Malolos The Satire by Telephone The Philippines a Century Hence The Indolence of the Filipinos The State of Religiosity in the Philippines Friars and Filipinos one unfinished novel Rizal 's letters to Pablo Pastels and some religious thoughts and other miscellaneous writings and correspondence including My Last Farewell
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#34:1:A>
Fr Pablo Pastels is a Jesuit priest who was the former Director of the congregation of interns which Rizal once headed at the Ateneo <foreign> Municipal </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#35:1:A>
He was interested in the reconversion of Rizal to the Catholic faith since he believed that the latter went astray not only politically but also religiously because of self-love which in the context appears to mean false pride
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#36:1:A>
In a letter to Fr Antonio Obach the parish missionary to of Dapitan Fr Pastels requested the latter to tell Rizal to stop being silly by looking at things through the prism of his own judgment and self-love since no one is judge in his own case
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#37:1:A>
Rizal wrote the first letter on one September eighteen ninety-two to Fr Pastels explaining that God has given man reason and self-esteem and it must be for some purpose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#38:1:A>
It would be impractical to look at things according to Rizal or all his affairs through the prisms of others since there are as many prisms as there are individuals and it would be difficult to know which to choose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#40:1:A>
Moreover to look at things through the prisms of others would offend God because this is tantamount to scorning the most precious gifts which he has given to man
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#41:1:A>
When God endowed man a mind of his own He meant it to be used properly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#42:1:A>
God did not wish that one who has less brains should think like the one who has more and vice versa in the same way that no one should digest with the stomach of another
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#44:1:A>
With respect to self-love or self-esteem Rizal says he has prayed that God should dispossess him of it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#45:1:A>
But God has preserved it knowing all the while what is best for each man
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#46:1:A>
Self-love when tempered by reason can be used as a guide for man 's perfection and integrity <.> we </.> since it saves him from many perverse and vile acts when he has forgotten the precepts he has learned or imbibed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#48:1:A>
Rizal considers man as a masterpiece of creation so perfect in his nature that to deprive him of his component parts like reason and self-love would disfigure him and make him miserable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#49:1:A>
Rizal informs Fr Pastels that he sometimes prays but when he prays he does not ask for anything since he believes he has everything
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#50:1:A>
Whatever happens to him is God 's will
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#51:1:A>
And so he does not he does this or that as guided by his conscience because after all God will invariably have His own will fulfilled
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#52:1:A>
Fr Pastels laments in his first reply dated twelve October eighteen ninety-two that a young man like Rizal did not decide to take better causes <,> than the one that led to his misfortune all because of excessive self-love or a misunderstood feeling of personal dignity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#53:1:A>
It was German Protestantism that separated Rizal from the Catholic faith and French Freemasonry that goaded him to filibusterism
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#54:1:A>
<foreign> Noli Me Tangere </foreign> is the result of the first captivity while <foreign> El Filibusterismo </foreign> the result of the second captivity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#55:1:A>
One whose mind has been obstructed and corrupted by erroneous principles and unruly affections cannot be guided by the light of his own judgment and conscience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#56:1:A>
According to Fr Pastels the lamp of this light is unreliable and no matter how wise a man be he cannot be so wise as not to need the help of another 's knowledge
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#58:1:A>
It is therefore necessary to be guided by the lamp of others so to abide by the criterion <,> or to abide by the criterion and judgment of others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#59:1:A>
It is not it is a natural lamp the knowledge of which is derived from right reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#60:1:A>
Nevertheless according to Fr Pastels we need another lamp a supernatural one that will point to us the rocks of this life and the port of salvation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#61:1:A>
The rest of the reply is an incursion into a discussion of theology proper which is supposed to be a rebuttal of Rizal 's first captivity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#62:1:A>
Fr Pastels explains the nature of revealed knowledge as inspired by the Holy Spirit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#63:1:A>
He argues that even if faith exceeds reason there cannot exist between them a true opposition because God endows the human soul with the light of reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#64:1:A>
Since God cannot deny faith and reason then the truth of reason cannot contradict the truth of faith
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#65:1:A>
If there is an apparent contradiction it is either the dogmas of faith have not been properly understood or the ravings of opinion are unworthily considered as axioms of reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#66:1:A>
Fr Pastels promises to offer a rebuttal and the future of the second captivity that is Rizal 's separatist ideas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#67:1:A>
Rizal 's second letter of eleven November eighteen ninety-two argues that although there are better causes his cause is good and sufficient for him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#68:1:A>
He is not sorry for the humbleness of his cause the poverty of the rewards it offers and the little talent that God has given him to serve his cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#69:1:A>
But God cannot err cannot err in His acts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#70:1:A>
He ordains them and He knows that the future what the future will bring
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#71:1:A>
Besides Rizal says he does not aspire to eternal fame or to eternal renown
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#72:1:A>
Rizal bewails the fact that Fr Pastels believes in everything he hears without investigating it first
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#73:1:A>
Rizal read German books but to presume Germans had inspired him is to betray ignorance about the German people their character and their occupations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#75:1:A>
Only one-fourth of <foreign> Noli Me Tangere </foreign> was written in Germany one-half in Madrid and the other fourth in Paris
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#76:1:A>
No German had heard of his book before it was published
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#77:1:A>
He was certainly influenced by the cool cool German environment and the free industrious studious and well-administered German populace full of confidence in its future and master of its destiny
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#78:1:A>
Rizal denies being a Protestant
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#79:1:A>
He respects religious ideas but does not consider religion as the science of conveniences or an art of enjoying life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#80:1:A>
Had he accepted Protestantism he would now be rich free and full of honors instead of being a poor deportee
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#81:1:A>
The reference clearly points to the wealthy <?> Bowsted </?> family of France whose daughter Nellie was willing to marry Rizal only if Rizal would embrace Protestantism
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#82:1:A>
Rizal did have conversations with a German Protestant minister <?> at Odenvoldt </?> for a period of three months but the discussion was dispassionate and completely free and there was a priest who joined their discussion once a month
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#85:1:A>
Rizal concluded two things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#86:1:A>
One an idea sincerely conceived and practiced no matter how opposite it is to one 's own convictions deserves a deep respect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#87:1:A>
And two religions no matter what they may be should never make men enemies but brothers and good brothers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#88:1:A>
The minister and the priest individually did his duty and left to God the judgment who of them interpreted His will correctly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#89:1:A>
Truth may be polarized or obstructed and distorted when it enters one understanding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#90:1:A>
Reason can be mistaken and can be limited
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#91:1:A>
Nevertheless according to Rizal it is only reason that can correct its own mistakes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#92:1:A>
Reason alone can rise <.> a </.> after such falls that are rather unavoidable in its long pilgrimage on earth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#93:1:A>
No doubt far superior to human reason is the supernatural or divine light but who can justly claim that he is the reflector of that light
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#95:1:A>
All religions pretend to possess the truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#96:1:A>
Moreover says Rizal truth is seen from different angles and therefore religious moral and political truths are complex and must be studied piecemeal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#98:1:A>
Nobody has the right to judge the beliefs of others using his own beliefs as norm or criteria
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#99:1:A>
Rizal promises Fr Pastels that he will elaborate and explain why his religious views are different in his next mail if the latter is interested
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#100:1:A>
Regarding separatist ideas Rizal asked Fr Pastels <quote> who told you that my country 's welfare which is all that I seek can be attained only through separation </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#102:1:A>
In his second reply dated eight <.> Octo </.> December eighteen ninety-two <,> Fr Pastels expresses his interest in Rizal 's religious views but insists that the latter 's twofold conclusion <?> at Odenvoldt </?> is completely Protestant because it is the consecration of man 's personal judgment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#103:1:A>
Fr Pastels criticizes the German priest as a simpleton ignorant and <.> mu </.> and must have lost the Catholic common sense because the difference between Catholics and Protestants is not a matter of opinion but a matter of faith
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#104:1:A>
He likewise criticizes reason without being illumined by faith as dangerous <.> sin </.> it is since it is subject to the caprices of the mad woman of the house called Lady Imagination
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#105:1:A>
The aberrations and misdeeds of independent reason can only be corrected by reason itself illumined by faith
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#106:1:A>
It is this alone that can save true knowledge and true religion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#107:1:A>
True religion cannot tolerate these errors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#108:1:A>
For as Christ Christ says who is not with me is against me <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#109:1:A>
Fr Pastels is glad that Rizal believes in one personal God Creator and Lord who throws worlds into space endowed with reason and has given every individual man this tiny spark we call understanding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#110:1:A>
He congratulates himself that Rizal for believing in one God Creator and Lord of everything created was not a partisan to the to Cartesianism and its offsprings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#111:1:A>
That is to say to materialism idealism and pantheism in philosophy to liberalism in politics to deism rationalism incredulity and <.> indif </.> indifferentism in religion to romanticism and naturalism in literature and fine arts and to positivism and egoism in domestic civil and social economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#112:1:A>
But does Rizal admit the divinity of Jesus Christ and the divine institution of His Church
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#113:1:A>
To Rizal 's query as to who is the true reflector of God 's light Fr Pastels answers that it is Jesus Christ who by virtue of His human nature is the legitimate reflector and by virtue of His divine nature is the light itself the splendor of his Eternal Father
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-044#114:1:A>
What follows in the reply is the discussion of the Holy Trinity and the miracles performed by Jesus Christ to prove His divine mission
