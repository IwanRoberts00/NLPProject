<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#3:1>
As the Holy Week comes to an end, a joyful celebration
commemorates the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#4:1>
Every member of the Christian faith looks forward to this celebration
which is the culmination of the Passion of our Lord.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#5:1>
Observed in all Christian Churches, this holy day is considered a very
important one. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#6:1>
The date of Easter Sunday varies every year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#7:1>
It is usually celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon which
occurs on or next after March 21 and is therefore celebrated between March 22
and April 25 inclusive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#8:1>
This date was fixed by the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#9:1>
An example of celebrations during Easter is the Russian
celebrations during the 1700s.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#10:1>
It was kind of a prolonged Easter week and preparations began as
early as late January or February, in the depths of the Russian winter with
its deep snow.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#11:1>
Eight weeks before Easter Sunday, a week of carnival known as
<mention> Butter Week </mention> began.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#12:1>
Everybody ate huge amounts of food.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#13:1>
<foreign> <it> Blini </it> </foreign> , a special small pancake
soaked in butter, was given and eaten all throughout the carnival week.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#14:1>
This food was symbolic of the sun, lovely days and happy marriages.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#15:1>
Lemon and Latvian <foreign> vodka </foreign> accompany this
specialty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#16:1>
Also during carnival week, masked figures ran through streets
where actors and dancing bears entertained the crowd.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#17:1>
Schools and public offices were closed towards the end of the week.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#18:1>
The last day of the carnival week was when the Great Fast (
seven-week penance) began.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#19:1>
People eat only fish, mushroom, vegetables and coffee.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#20:1>
Meat, milk, butter, sugar and eggs were forbidden.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#21:1>
In Easter Week the fast ends and people celebrate with more feasting:
dominated by decorating, giftgiving and eating of eggs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#22:1>
The western world, particularly North America, introduced in the
East its own kind of Easter celebration.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#23:1>
The Easter egg-hunt is the activity that both young and old alike
enjoy the best.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#24:1>
The rabbits and colorful eggs are but a couple of western Easter
figures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#25:1>
Here in the Philippines, there are a variety of names for the
Easter celebrations in the provinces.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#26:1>
The Ibanags call it <mention> <indig> <it> Padafung </it> </indig>
</mention> , Ilocanos, <mention> <it> <foreign> Domingo </foreign> - <indig>
Sabet </indig> </it> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#27:1>
The Pangasinenses know it as <mention> <indig> <it> Abet-abet </it>
</indig> </mention> , while the Cebuanos, Leytenos and Samarenos have always
known it as <mention> <indig> <it> Sugat </it> </indig> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#28:1>
And the Tagalogs call it the <mention> <indig> <it> Salubong </it>
</indig> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#29:1>
No matter what we call it, the portrayal of the meeting of the Risen
Lord and His mother is still the focal point of Filipino Christian Easter
celebration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#30:1>
In most Philippine Christian Churches, a huge four-poster roof is
erected in preparation of the <indig> <it> Salubong </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#31:1>
Before the crack of dawn on Easter Sunday, two processions leave the
church.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#32:1>
One is the male procession of the risen Christ, carried by the men on
an <foreign> <it> andas </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#33:1>
In front of the <foreign> <it> andas </it> </foreign> is a young man
carrying the long pole of the banner of <foreign> <it> Agnus Dei </it>
</foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#34:1>
The second is the female procession of the <foreign> <it> Mater
Dolorosa </it> </foreign> in mourning black with a veil covering the face.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#35:1>
They go through separate routes and eventually meet on the two sides
of the roof for the <indig> <it> Salubong </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#36:1>
Meanwhile, little angels are positioned near the roof singing a
glorious hymn, usually the <mention> <foreign> <it> Regina Coeli Laetare
</it> </foreign> </mention> and the <mention> <foreign> <it> Alleluia </it>
</foreign> </mention> , and the principal angel is lowered from the roof to
remove the mourning vestment of the Blessed Virgin.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#37:1>
The other angels shower the two <foreign> <it> andas </it> </foreign>
with flower petals.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#38:1>
The band then proceeds to play a festive march and both images are
then carried inside the Church, enthroned for 40 days in the altar, until the
feast of the Ascension.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#39:1>
When the <foreign> <it> andas </it> </foreign> of Christ and Mary are
finally enthroned, the Easter Mass starts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#40:1>
Variations of the <indig> <it> Salubong </it> </indig> can be
found in the different places in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#41:1>
In Gasan, Marinduque, the two processions separate in the church
patio and not inside.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#42:1>
In Malolos, Bulacan, more images accompany the <foreign> <it> andas
</it> </foreign> of the bereaved Mother of Christ like Sts. John and Peter,
Mary Magdalene, Veronica and other women in the Passion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#43:1>
In Kamaligan, Albay, nine angels are lowered simultaneously with the
principal angel to help in removing the Blessed Virgin 's mourning vestment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#44:1>
In Baliwag town also in Bulacan, doves are released along with the
opening of the huge flower that would shower the Virgin with fragrant flower
petals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#45:1>
Celebrations of the Resurrection do not end on Easter Sunday.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#46:1>
In Pakil, Laguna, after Easter the <foreign> <it> Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora de Dolores </it> </foreign> or <indig> <it> Turumba </it>
</indig> is being honored with seven weekly feasts called <mention> <indig>
<it> lupi </it> </indig> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#47:1>
<mention> <indig> <it> Lupi </it> </indig> </mention> is the feast
for each of the seven daggers piercing the Virgin 's heart.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#48:1>
Devotees from far and wide flock to Pakil to honor the Virgin and
bathe in the <mention> <indig> <it> toromba </it> </indig> </mention> ( a
white-tiled swimming pool) where the Virgin was seen to have bathed a long
time ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#49:1>
The commemoration of Christ 's resurrection is not confined to
celebrations just every Easter Sunday and the following days.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#50:1>
<mention> <foreign> <it> Retablos </it> </foreign> </mention> are
<foreign> bas-relief </foreign> presentations of a certain religious event or
personage usually found in church altars.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#51:1>
Easter pictures like Christ 's resurrection or the Blessed Virgin 's
image or other images of the women of Christ 's passion are sculpted
magnificently to help us remember the significance of Easter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#52:1>
These are but some of the rituals that are observed during
Easter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#53:1>
And whatever celebration people all around the world do, Easter
Sunday still remains as the joyful consummation of the solemn Holy Week. </p>

<h> <bold> Philosophically speaking: What it means to be human
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#56:2>
<bold> Leovino Ma. Garcia </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#57:2>
LET ME warn you, dear reader, right away.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#58:2>
This article is, unashamedly, in praise of France.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#59:2>
In praise of Emmanuel Levinas, in particular - - the eminent
French-Jewish philosopher who passed away at the age of ninety last December
25, 1995.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#60:2>
But it is not because Levinas has interesting things to say on what
it means to be French but because he has more interesting things to say on
what it means to be human. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#61:2>
Levinas is one among the many French philosophers whose writings
have been studied, commented and translated by several generations of
teachers and students at the Ateneo de Manila University.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#62:2>
In the early sixties, the Philosophy department already offered
courses fully devoted to Descartes, Gabriel Marcel, Teilhard de Chardin,
followed later by courses on Sartre, Camus, Merleau-Ponty, Ricoeur, Levinas,
and more recently, Derrida and Foucault. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#63:2>
Through a &ldquo; loving struggle &rdquo; with the texts of these
philosophers, French philosophy has been able not only to survive but to
thrive in Loyola Heights.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#64:2>
However, the French thinking that has flourished is the kind that
respects and takes delight in differences.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#65:2>
Most Ateneans like to think that they become more fully themselves,
more fully Filipino because they have been nourished by a certain &ldquo;
French excellence &rdquo; in thinking.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#66:2>
This way of thinking is a thinking in praise of the Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#67:2>
Which brings us back to Emmanuel Levinas because he is <foreign> par
excellence </foreign> the philosopher of the Other, for the Other. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#68:2>
<h> <bold> Law of the I and Law of the Other </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#69:2>
What then has happened?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#70:2>
An &ldquo; earthquake &rdquo; occurred in contemporary philosophy
brought about by the publication in 1961 of Levinas ' major work entitled
<mention> &ldquo; Totality and Infinity. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#71:2>
The <mention> &ldquo; I &rdquo; </mention> of modern philosophy which
has been placed at the center, at the summit of everything is dislodged,
decentered.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#72:2>
Instead of a dominating <mention> I </mention> , there is a &ldquo;
humbled, wounded &rdquo; <mention> I </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#73:2>
To be fair, of course, this decentering of the <mention> I </mention>
was not single-handedly accomplished by Levinas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#74:2>
It had also been prepared by the &ldquo; masters of suspicion &rdquo;
- - the unholy trinity of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#75:2>
To appreciate better this &ldquo; decentering, &rdquo; one will
have to recall here the famous distinction made by Levinas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#76:2>
According to him, there are two different ways of thinking or
relating designated by <mention> &ldquo; The Law of the I &rdquo; </mention>
and <mention> &ldquo; The Law of the Other. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#77:2>
<mention> &ldquo; The Law of the I &rdquo; </mention> is thinking
that starts from myself, goes out to the Other, and returns to myself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#78:2>
In this perspective, the <mention> I </mention> is at the center.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#79:2>
The <mention> I </mention> reduces the other to itself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#80:2>
Here, the <mention> I </mention> is the Law.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#81:2>
<mention> &ldquo; The Law of the Other &rdquo; </mention> is a
thinking that moves from the <mention> I </mention> to the <mention> Other
</mention> without returning to the <mention> I </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#82:2>
It is a way of thinking that abandons the familiar for the unknown.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#83:2>
Here, the <mention> I </mention> is no longer the Law.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#84:2>
The <mention> Other </mention> is the Law.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#85:2>
Levinas clarifies this difference between the <mention> Law of the I
</mention> and the <mention> Law of the Other </mention> by evoking two
figures - - Ulysses and Abraham.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#86:2>
The <mention> Law of the I </mention> resembles the journey of
Ulysses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#87:2>
Ulysses leaves his home in Ithaca but after all his wanderings,
returns home to Ithaca.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#88:2>
In contrast, the <mention> Law of the Other </mention> refers to
Abraham who, obeying God 's command, leaves his home forever for an unknown
land. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#89:2>
<h> Responsibility for the Other </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#90:2>
Where does the <mention> Law of the I </mention> turn into the
<mention> Law of the Other </mention> ?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#91:2>
When does the decentering of the <mention> I </mention> occur?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#92:2>
It occurs in the &ldquo; Face to Face &rdquo; encounter.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#93:2>
It happens when I truly have an &ldquo; ethical &rdquo; experience,
an experience of the Other as Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#94:2>
When I meet and look at the Other, the Other manifests itself to me
as a face who addresses me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#95:2>
Unlike a thing ( a stone or a dog), the Other 's Face in the strict
sense cannot be objectified or classified.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#96:2>
The Other 's Face presents itself as radically new.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#97:2>
The Face teaches me that the Other is not only different but truly
Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#98:2>
The Face teaches me that there exists a reality I cannot use or
manipulate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#99:2>
There is a reality I must respect and serve. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#100:2>
This experience of radical otherness, this encounter of the Face
to Face is the point of departure of the ethical relation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#101:2>
The Face appears concretely as a command: <quote> &ldquo; Do not
kill! &rdquo; </quote> Positively put, this command includes the plea to
promote the Other as Other: <quote> &ldquo; Please take care of me! &rdquo;
</quote> <quote> &ldquo; Take compassion on me. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#102:2>
The Other 's Face is not only experienced as an irreducible
command but also as a helpless misery.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#103:2>
In the biblical sense, the Other is literally the stranger, the
widow, the orphan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#104:2>
It is precisely the other 's misery which makes the command ethical.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#105:2>
As command, the Other demands my recognition.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#106:2>
But as misery, the Other cannot compel me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#107:2>
The Other can only plead with me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#108:2>
The Other 's Face at the same time orders and begs me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#109:2>
To sum up, the Face to Face experience is ethical because it is
simultaneously a command and a plea, a demanding and begging to which I
respond in freedom. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#110:2>
Responsibility comes &ldquo; through the Other. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#111:2>
The Other, in silently addressing me, makes me uniquely responsible.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#112:2>
What is most original in Levinas ' interpretation of
responsibility-for-the-Other is that I am not only responsible for what I do
but even for what I do not do.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#113:2>
I am responsible for what does not even matter to me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#114:2>
Without having chosen it, I am responsible for the Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#115:2>
I am responsible for the Other without waiting for reciprocity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#116:2>
Responsibility then is essential to being human.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#117:2>
Responsibility is not a luxury.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#118:2>
To be a human being, a <mention> <it> subject </it> </mention> for
Levinas is to be responsible for the Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#119:2>
In this regard, Levinas cites many times a passage from Dostoyevsky 's
<mention> &ldquo; The Brothers Karamazov &rdquo; </mention> : <X> <quote>
&ldquo; We are all responsible for all, for all men before all, and I more
than all the others. &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#120:2>
<h> <bold> From Knowledge-Power to Service </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#121:2>
Levinas puts into question a whole philosophical tradition (
from Plato to Heidegger) which he claims has reduced the Other in a view of
philosophy as knowledge-power.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#122:2>
In this view, knowledge is power over the Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#123:2>
Knowledge consists in the manipulation or domination of the Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#124:2>
According to Levinas, the &ldquo; totalitarian &rdquo; philosophies
of the past have failed <quote> &ldquo; to think the Other." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#125:2>
What Levinas proposes is a view of philosophy which puts itself
into question.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#126:2>
He is interested in the capacity of philosophy to question itself,
to &ldquo; unsay &rdquo; itself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#127:2>
The most remarkable thing about philosophy, for Levinas, is that it
fails to comprehend or grasp everything.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#128:2>
But this failure is a blessing in disguise.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#129:2>
Failing to absorb all meaning, philosophy remains open to the
irreducible Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#130:2>
For Levinas, philosophizing is not a retreat into oneself but a
going out to the Other. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#131:2>
At the root of Levinas ' philosophical interrogation, there is
the overwhelming astonishment that there is the Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#132:2>
This Other is Other!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#133:2>
From this moment on, philosophy is no longer limited to a search for
the truth, my truth.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#134:2>
Philosophy turns from a &ldquo; love of wisdom &rdquo; into a
&ldquo; wisdom of love &rdquo; understood as responsibility for the Other.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#135:2>
If philosophy wants to understand what it means to be human, it
must place itself &ldquo; in the service &rdquo; of the Other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#136:2>
The philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas is unique in that it relates
thought neither to <it> being </it> nor to the <it> true </it> but to the
<it> good </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#137:2>
And the good for Levinas is <quote> &ldquo; the surplus of the
importance of the Other over myself. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-007#138:2>
The good is <quote> &ldquo; answering for the Other. &rdquo; </quote> </p>
</I>
