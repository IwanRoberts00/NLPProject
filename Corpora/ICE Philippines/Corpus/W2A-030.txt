<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#4:1>
Mango is a fruit of the old world cultivated for 6,000 years or so
( Hill, 1952).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#5:1>
From its origin in India and IndoChina ( Bondad, 1989) mango has found
its way in at least 87 countries ( Bondad, 1980).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#6:1>
Mango is regarded as the most important tropical fruit with an annual
production of about 17.7 million metric tons ( FAO, 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#7:1>
The prospects for the mango industry are very bright ( Bondad, 1980;
Haines, 1991).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#8:1>
Mango has been the subject of national ( Plant Production Committee,
1984; Thailand 's Mango Development Forum, 1978) and international forums (
Chacko <foreign> et al. </foreign> 1991; Chadha and Pal, 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#9:1>
The long history, widespread cultivation, economic value, number of
workers, and volume of research make mango growing highly eligible to have
its own special branch in agriculture similar to citriculture or
vitriculture.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#10:1>
It is surprising, however, that the term <mention> &ldquo;
mangiculture &rdquo; </mention> never got into the mango literature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#11:1>
The purpose of this paper is to define <mention> &ldquo;
mangiculture &rdquo; </mention> and some other related terms often confused,
misused, or misunderstood.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#12:1>
It also aims to update readers on recent developments in mangiculture
with emphasis on Philippine conditions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#13:1>
<h> <bold> TERMINOLOGY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#14:1>
<h> <it> Mangiculture </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#15:1>
<it> <foreign> Mangifera </foreign> </it> has 39 species ( Iyer,
1991); at least five of these are cultivated, namely: <it> <foreign> M.
altissima </foreign> </it> Blanco ( <indig> paho </indig> ) , <it> <foreign>
M. caesia </foreign> </it> Jack ( <indig> bauno </indig> ) , <it> <foreign>
M. foetida </foreign> </it> Lour.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#16:1>
( <indig> bachang </indig> ) , <it> <foreign> M. indica </foreign>
</it> . ( mango), <it> <foreign> M. odorata </foreign> </it> Griff ( <indig>
huani </indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#17:1>
<mention> Mangiculture </mention> refers to the science and art of
growing cultivars of <it> <foreign> Mangifera indica </foreign> </it> L. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#18:1>
<h> <it> Mango </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#19:1>
This refers to fruits of commerce belonging to the species <it>
<foreign> M. indica </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#20:1>
The proposed definition of <mention> mangiculture </mention> agrees
with this statement.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#21:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Mango &rdquo; </mention> , the common English term,
was derived from the original Tamil word <foreign> <mention> &ldquo; mangas
&rdquo; </mention> </foreign> ( Singh, 1960). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#22:1>
<h> <it> Mangga </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#23:1>
In Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines <mention> <indig> &ldquo;
mangga &rdquo; </indig> </mention> is the local term for <mention> mango
</mention> ( Kusumo <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1975; Sukonthasing
<foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1991) and this is also a variation of the
original Tamil word <mention> <foreign> &ldquo; mangas &rdquo; </foreign>
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#24:1>
<h> <it> Mangos </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#25:1>
The plural of <mention> mango </mention> in the U.S. and U.S. -
influenced countries is formed by adding an <mention> &ldquo; s &rdquo;
</mention> , hence <mention> &ldquo; mangos &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#26:1>
This usage does not follow the practice for such native English words
as <mention> tomato </mention> and <mention> potato </mention> which form the
plural by adding an <mention> &ldquo; es &rdquo; </mention> , hence <mention>
&ldquo; tomatoes &rdquo; </mention> and <mention> &ldquo; potatoes &rdquo;
</mention> , but <mention> &ldquo; mangos &rdquo; </mention> and <mention>
&ldquo; avocados &rdquo; </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#27:1>
<h> <it> Mangoes </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#28:1>
The Philippines, although very much influenced by the U.S., deviates
from the American practice by spelling the plural form of <mention> mango
</mention> with an <mention> &ldquo; es &rdquo; </mention> which is also the
British usage.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#29:1>
Barrett ( 1912) has pointed out 82 years ago that it is erroneous to
write <mention> &ldquo; mangoes &rdquo; </mention> but it has become
customary and acceptable and remained in use today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#30:1>
<h> <it> <indig> Huani </indig> </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#31:1>
The residents of Mindanao around Zamboanga often say <mention>
<indig> &ldquo; mangga huani &rdquo; </indig> </mention> when referring to
the fruits of <it> <foreign> M. odorata </foreign> </it> . This is improper
because <indig> huani </indig> is a separate species.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#32:1>
It is easy to make this mistake because <indig> huani </indig> has
all the external attributes of a mango fruit--size, shape, color -- but is
distinguished by its objectionable odor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#33:1>
<h> <indig> <it> Paho </it> </indig> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#34:1>
This is the common name for <it> <foreign> M. altissima </foreign>
</it> , a small fruit eaten immature with meals serving as an appetizer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#35:1>
The fruit ripens green ( Bondad <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1979).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#36:1>
In the Visayas, it is the local term for <mention> mango </mention> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#37:1>
<h> <indig> <it> Carabao </it> </indig> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#38:1>
Races are recognized in mango.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#39:1>
For the <indig> Carabao </indig> race the commercially-grown strains
include <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Carabao </indig> &rdquo; </mention> ,
<mention> 'manila' </mention> , and <mention> <indig> 'Lamao' </indig>
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#40:1>
De Leon ( 1916) described several other forms of <indig> Carabao
</indig> that may well be members of this race.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#41:1>
Other well-known races of mango are Saigon, West India, Cuban, and
Hawaiian. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#42:1>
A short ( 7.6 to 9.4 cm), ovate-oblong mango that remains green
when ripe is improperly referred to in Davao del Sur as &ldquo; <indig>
Carabao </indig> &ldquo; .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#43:1>
Calvo ( 1983) has described and named this mango as &ldquo; <mention>
Digos </mention> &ldquo; , after a town where he conducted the work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#44:1>
<h> <indig> <it> Pahutan </it> </indig> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#45:1>
This is often confused for <indig> paho </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#46:1>
<indig> 'Pahutan' </indig> is a cultivar of <it> M. indica </it> much
larger ( 8 to 9 cm) than <indig> paho </indig> ( 5 to 5.5 cm) but small for
an ordinary mango ( 12 cm).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#47:1>
It ripens with yellow skin and flesh, is very juicy but fibrous and
the seed is too large in proportion to the fruit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#48:1>
<h> <it> Indian mango </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#49:1>
Many use the term <mention> &ldquo; Indian mango &rdquo; </mention>
in referring to a small ( 8.0 cm long), roundish ( short oval) fruit best
eaten mature-green.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#50:1>
It ripens with green skin.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#51:1>
This mango is <foreign> 'Kachamitha' </foreign> , one of several
grafted plants introduced from India in 1911 ( Bondad and Valmayor, 1979).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#52:1>
It is imprecise to use <mention> &ldquo; Indian mango &rdquo;
</mention> because there are more than 1,000 different cultivars of mango in
India ( Iyer, 1991). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#53:1>
<h> <it> Manila </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#54:1>
In Mexico, 35% of the annual production is made up of the <mention> 'manila'
mango </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#55:1>
<mention> 'manila' </mention> is a cultivar of Philippine origin
brought to Mexico via the Galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco while the
two countries were Spanish colonies from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#56:1>
It is a member of the <indig> Carabao </indig> race and differs but
slightly from the <indig> Carabao </indig> cultivar ( Bondad, 1989). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#57:1>
<h> <it> Manila super mango </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#58:1>
The panel which represented the Philippine government during the
negotiation to lift the Japanese ban on Philippine mangoes &ldquo; invented
&rdquo; the term <mention> &ldquo; Manila super &rdquo; mango </mention> for
trade of the fruit in Japan ( Castillo and Estocapio, 1975).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#59:1>
The Mexican 'manila' mango, which was already in Japan at the time,
is promoted by this Philippine effort.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#60:1>
The term <mention> &ldquo; Manila super mango &rdquo; </mention> is a
misnomer and should be dropped. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#61:1>
<h> <it> Manila mango </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#62:1>
The Ministry of Trade and Industry is using the term <mention>
&ldquo; Manila mango &rdquo; </mention> to promote the fruit abroad ( CITEM,
1983).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#63:1>
Two years later, the same promotions group inverted the words and
published <mention> &ldquo; Mango Manila &rdquo; </mention> ( CITEM, 1985).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#64:1>
Either way, the Mexican mango industry is favored.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#65:1>
Apparently, <mention> <indig> 'Carabao' </indig> </mention> is
unattractive to the Ministry officials for promotion abroad but this is the
name that made the Philippines famous for mango and <mention> <indig> 'Carabao'
</indig> </mention> is recognized internationally for well over half a
century now.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#66:1>
Besides, the effort to change it is not helping the Philippine mango
industry. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#67:1>
<h> <bold> ESTABLISHMENT </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#68:1>
<h> <bold> Seedling Trees </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#69:1>
In the old system of establishing mango trees, seeds are sown and
plants are set very far from each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#70:1>
Raising mangoes the old way had its roots during the Spanish time (
1521-1898) in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#71:1>
The Spaniards brought many crops here but mango was not one of them
contrary to Ochse <foreign> et al. </foreign> 's ( 1961) claim that Spanish
voyagers introduced mangoes from India to Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#72:1>
They are not credited for this important crop but it was under their
rule that plantings of mango became established.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#73:1>
The plants they allowed to proliferate are from seeds and failed to
introduce asexual propagation which has been in use elsewhere even before
their arrival here.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#74:1>
It was in this era that huge, present-day, century old trees became
established.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#75:1>
One such tree in Lagangilang, Abra is 23 m tall and 25 m wide.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#76:1>
Seedling trees in orchard are slightly smaller ( 20 m) but
nevertheless huge and the wide canopy spread is the basis of the old system
of planting.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#77:1>
Much of the backyard plantings are seedling trees that comprise a
large portion of today 's mango industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#78:1>
Cabotage ( 1975) estimated this to be about 95%.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#79:1>
The number of grafted trees is increasing but their proportion is
unknown. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#80:1>
<h> <bold> Grafted Trees </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#81:1>
Among the early contributions of Americans to Philippine
agriculture was asexual propagation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#82:1>
In 1912, Wester described various techniques and in the same year
recommended to plant the crop at a distance not less than 10 m and preferably
12 to 15 cm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#83:1>
These statements are rather too early for a newcomer to the
Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#84:1>
The oldest grafted tree then would not be more than 10 years,
Americans having arrived only between 1900 and 1910.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#85:1>
It takes a grafted tree about 25 to 30 years to become full-grown.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#86:1>
The canopy spread of a full-grown tree is the basis of determining
the planting distance ( Galang, 1995).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#87:1>
A possible reason for coming up with a recommendation that early is
the American experience on mango growing in Florida where trees are set at an
average of 11 ( Young and Sauls, 1978) and 12 m ( Ruehle and Ledin, 1955).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#88:1>
Mango trees are expected to be more vigorous under tropical
temperatures and heavy rainfall in the Philippines, hence Wester 's ( 1912)
preference for a wider distance ( average of 13.5 m).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#89:1>
In a later bulletin on mango growing, Wester ( 1920) maintained his
1912 recommendations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#90:1>
Filipino mango workers either did not believe the American
horticulturist; were still influenced by the old system of planting seedling
trees at wide distances; or had no basis to draw from orchards of grafted
trees being quite young at the time.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#91:1>
Workers at the Department of Agriculture and Commerce ( 1939), Bureau
of Plant Industry ( Lazo, 1956), and Araneta Institute of Agriculture (
Galang, 1955) recommended distances of 16 to 20 m, 20 m, and 16 to 18 m,
respectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#92:1>
Later authors ( Angeles, 1989; Cuevas, 1976; Lazo and Gonzales,
1970; Mango Committee, 1975, 1978; Valmayor <foreign> et al. </foreign> ,
1971) gave mostly 14 m and this has become traditional practice; although
they provided no data or explanation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#93:1>
Our measurements of full-grown grafted trees in three large orchards
which averaged 14.5 m tend to support what has become traditional distance of
planting grafted <indig> 'Carabao' </indig> mango trees. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#94:1>
<h> <bold> High Density Planting </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#95:1>
Establishing mango the modern way in part means setting grafted
trees much closer than the old or traditional distance, resulting in high
population per hectare.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#96:1>
Growers have long planted the mango at close spacing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#97:1>
I have seen, for example in 1980, 8 to 10-year-old grafted <indig> 'Carabao'
</indig> mangoes planted 7 x 7 m in Cuenca, Batangas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#98:1>
Many other orchards have gone high density but the first massive
planting was in 1982 with the establishment of 46,000 grafted <indig> 'Carabao'
</indig> mangoes in Silang, Cavite at a distance of 5 x 8 m ( Tividad
<foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#99:1>
When last counted in 1992, there were only 12,000 hills.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#100:1>
Trees were abandoned completely in 1986, when another massive
planting also at 5 x 8 m of more than 45,000 trees began in Guimaras. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#101:1>
A common observation among growers of closely-planted mangoes is
failure to perform intensive cultivation required of high density systems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#102:1>
As a result in Cavite, for example, trees became overcrowded making
leafhopper control very difficult.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#103:1>
The same problem will be met with anthracnose, a view held earlier
by Ruehle and Ledin ( 1955), because the situation creates a more favorable
condition for the growth of the fungus.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#104:1>
Overcrowding will prevent a thorough spraying for full canopy
coverage aggravating pest attack.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#105:1>
There is also a tendency for trees to produce few fruits and these
are usually of poor quality under overcrowded condition. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#106:1>
<h> <bold> Systematic Removal </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#107:1>
Removal of trees in alternate rows is standard recommendation in
the growing of temperate fruits in which the practice is long known (
Westwood, 1978).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#108:1>
No similar experience is available on mango and much of the
statements on the subject ( Bondad <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1995) are
based on separate pieces of information put together.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#109:1>
Useful data consist of canopy spread of relatively young trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#110:1>
In Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna 5 to 6-year-old grafted <indig> 'Carabao'
</indig> mango trees have canopy spread of 4.6 to 6.4 m ( Medina, 1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#111:1>
Thirteen-year-old <indig> 'Carabao' </indig> mango trees, also
grafted in Jordan, Guimaras, are 9.0 m wide ( Covacha, 1986).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#112:1>
All trees measured were well managed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#113:1>
Based in part on the preceding observation, Bondad <foreign> et
al. </foreign> ( 1995) suggested 4 x 6 m for the establishment of a high
density plantation in Rizal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#114:1>
Thinning may begin on the fifth or sixth year by removing
alternately whole lines of in-row trees leaving a 6 x 8 m planting.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#115:1>
The next thinning will depend on the rate of growth but on the 10th
year, trees 6 m apart will have definitely overlapping canopies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#116:1>
If this row is removed, the remaining trees will be crowded after 10
years but it will be spacious on the 12 m side so that the next thinning may
be delayed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#117:1>
There is sufficient working space for thorough pesticide spraying of
canopies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#118:1>
In the end, the distance will be 12 x 16 m. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#119:1>
The above suggestion may not hold in other situations because of
differences in soil, climate, and culture among other factors.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#120:1>
Nevertheless, it is a possible program for a systematic removal of
trees which should apply where the growing conditions are met.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#121:1>
Canopy spread elsewhere may differ but not too greatly and where
necessary, a grower could make adjustments to fit his local needs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#122:1>
Incidentally in Thailand, 4 x 6 m is apparently suggested too
and one 352-ha orchard was planted actually at this density.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-030#123:1>
Plantings at much closer distances ( e.g., 2.5 x 2.5 m) have been
reported in Thailand ( Charnvichit <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1991;
Khumlert, 1990). </p> </I>
