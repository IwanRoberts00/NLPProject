<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#3:1>
THE LAST OF MY visitors bends over just slightly, and whispers so
that only I can hear.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#4:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I will follow, &rdquo; </quote> he says. <quote>
&ldquo; In sleep. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#5:1>
His face hangs sadly over this plate of glass, and I recognize his
pain, though my eyes are shut and still.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#6:1>
Horacio is old now, a fragile soul whose hair has greyed like mine.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#7:1>
We are mere shells of what we once were, but he has not forgotten.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#8:1>
He cannot have forgotten. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#9:1>
After all, we have been fixtures on this street for over seventy
years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#10:1>
But you never knew about Horacio and myself, did you?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#11:1>
I am sure that the stories you have been hearing are quite a
surprise.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#12:1>
Everything happened such a long time before you were born.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#13:1>
It should all be irrelevant now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#14:1>
The women in this room think otherwise, as you can see.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#15:1>
They make quite a fuss over Horacio 's arrival, speaking in hushed
voices about how silly he is, to be weeping over a woman he should have
married long ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#16:1>
They say that Horacio murmurs to himself too often, that he isn't of
much use to anyone anymore, and hasn't been for quite some time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#17:1>
He has lived his life wastefully, wallowing in regret. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#18:1>
My dear Horacio.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#19:1>
I do wish that you had understood me a little better. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#20:1>
I MUST TELL YOU, Corazon, seven and a half decades in this world
is reason enough for me to be thankful.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#21:1>
You know, <indig> Nanay </indig> <&> trans. Mother </&> was not as
fortunate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#22:1>
She died from the cholera during the rainy season, at the age of
thirty-four.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#23:1>
The photograph you keep of her was taken at a studio in the city,
before any of us were born.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#24:1>
It is said that she was a handsome woman, and you always liked to
think that you took after her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#25:1>
<indig> Tatay </indig> <&> trans. Father </&> had to care for all
of us, then--me and your two uncles, and of course your father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#26:1>
Since I was the eldest and the only daughter, I naturally received
more attention than the other three, I had all my own clothes, while my
brothers shared shirts, pants and shoes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#27:1>
Your poor father, being the youngest, was the worst off: whatever he
got to wear was always beaten and weatherworn, in sizes that were
consequently an embarrassment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#28:1>
But we had a generally happy life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#29:1>
It wasn't quite the same sort of life that you have now, but in our
time it was the best kind of life we knew.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#30:1>
<indig> Tatay </indig> always took your father with him on his old
horse, and they would stay at the <indig> kapihan </indig> <&> =coffee shop
</&> from early morning till suppertime.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#31:1>
Summers were the best, when we would go to the <indig> bukid </indig>
<&> =field </&> and laze under the <indig> kaimito </indig> <&> =starapple
</&> trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#32:1>
We had many friends, and the boys would bring guitars to join in the
<indig> harana </indig> <&> =serenade </&> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#33:1>
Sometimes, we would go off to Tagaytay, to the picnic grove, and
stroll through the hills.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#34:1>
I always wore my prettiest dress--I had quite a few before the war
broke out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#35:1>
The occupation did not leave us without its own stories.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#36:1>
When the American troops landed they recruited local scouts, and I
was one of the first women to sign up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#37:1>
They gave me an official identification card and a badge I wore
loyally.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#38:1>
We helped distribute rations to the soldiers in the <foreign> barrio
</foreign> ; in turn, we were given foodstuff and soap to take home.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#39:1>
We were also able to brush up on our English, constantly amusing the
Americans in our attempts to do so. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#40:1>
One day the troops left for Manila and the Japanese returned,
insidiously calling for the townsfolk to meet in Tagaytay.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#41:1>
Your father, your uncle Doroy and their gangmates went off to the
city 's municipal hall, where many others had gathered.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#42:1>
It was only then that they discovered the Japanese would decapitate
all who were present.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#43:1>
Each was to kneel on the side of the hill that faced the volcano, and
submit himself to the sword.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#44:1>
Fortunately, my brothers escaped unharmed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#45:1>
Later, we joined the families who went to Tagaytay to bury their
dead.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#46:1>
We searched for the heads of the headless, thrown into a pile at the
top of the hill.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#47:1>
But a few had rolled far into the lake, and so were left to guard the
waters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#48:1>
YOUR UNCLE NANI WAS the first among my brothers to marry.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#49:1>
He was also the first to leave a widow, because he was killed in
Bataan during the war.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#50:1>
He and your Aunt Gilda had one child, a daughter, who died in your
father 's arms at the innocent age of three.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#51:1>
The pneumonia took her just after the war, when doctors were scarce
even in the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#52:1>
Gilda, though she has lived alone ever since, has not neglected her
ties to the family.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#53:1>
She is and always has been a woman of admirable quality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#54:1>
Your uncle Doroy married some years after Nani did, taking for
himself a woman fifteen years younger than he.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#55:1>
She hailed from a neighboring <foreign> barrio </foreign> , and was
not like any of us who were occupied with sewing and embroidery.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#56:1>
She was an athlete, a tiny woman who had been a sprinter in school,
and knew nothing about domestic chores.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#57:1>
So your uncle Doroy did all the cooking and housework; he took care
of the farm as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#58:1>
Trinidad only learned the duties of a spouse after giving birth
to your cousins Felicia and Oca; she lost a third child that was stillborn.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#59:1>
Doroy nevertheless continued to spoil her, and always came to her
defense when we would quarrel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#60:1>
He loved Trinidad with uncompromising loyalty; it was then a bitter
loss she suffered the day he fell over and expired. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#61:1>
Your father Aldo was the last to marry, and he did so rather
late.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#62:1>
After a long and unpredictable courtship, he left his new bride in
our home and sailed off to work as a seaman.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#63:1>
I must admit, Leonora and I never quite got along too well.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#64:1>
She carried most of the burden of my difficult ways, and for good
reason: she was the last of my sisters-in-law, into whose care I left the
youngest of my brothers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#65:1>
By this time <indig> Tatay </indig> had passed on, and no one
could claim the authority to put me in my place.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#66:1>
As the oldest sibling, I felt that I should be able to run the
household in the manner I thought was best.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#67:1>
I felt that it was unthinkable for anyone to contradict me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#68:1>
And I was unmindful of how haphazard or tactless my methods might
have been. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#69:1>
Hardheaded, I believe, is the word they 've often used.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#70:1>
Yes, that 's likely the image by which I 've best been known. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#71:1>
OCA HAS A HARD time dealing with the fact that I am no longer
here.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#72:1>
He has only dared to approach my casket once, to give me a sideways
glance.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#73:1>
He can barely believe the sight of me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#74:1>
You really mustn't blame Oca for what happened--after all, it was
partly my own doing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#75:1>
Perhaps it was mostly my doing, because I spoiled him so.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#76:1>
But you must understand he is your only male cousin on our side of
the family--the only male heir--and it is he who will carry the family name.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#77:1>
We women have tried to make it easy for him, especially since he
has always stood in Felicia 's shadow.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#78:1>
What were we to do when she garnered all the school honors and
excelled in elocution?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#79:1>
Poor Oca was left so far behind he could never catch up with her, and
he didn't bother trying.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#80:1>
Later, we attempted to send him to a vocational school in the city,
but he would only end up spending his tuition money on lesser pleasures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#81:1>
None of this surprised us.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#82:1>
He had such low morale. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#83:1>
Even when we were able to get him a job, everyone had such high
expectations of him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#84:1>
Eventually the pressure got to him and he figured in that scandal
and--well, we didn't force him to find work elsewhere.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#85:1>
We thought it might be best for him to just stay with us here in the
<foreign> barrio </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#86:1>
But we never expected him to actually do work on the farm, the way
his father did. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#87:1>
Oca just isn't used to doing strenuous work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#88:1>
As for the drinking--well you know, all the men in the <foreign>
barrio </foreign> are drinkers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#89:1>
It is but normal for a man, if he wants to show he really is a man.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#90:1>
And we can't blame Oca for drinking a little more than the others,
what with the responsibility of having to put three sons through primary
school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#91:1>
It is quite a predicament for him, and his wife hardly works at all.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#92:1>
You really mustn't blame Oca for what happened to me, Corazon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#93:1>
A man like him just can't be helped. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#94:1>
IN A PLACE WHERE time is absent, I see its work more clearly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#95:1>
Time breathes its energies into the world, and things happen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#96:1>
That is when stories take shape. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#97:1>
This is the story of Horacio. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#98:1>
He came into the world just shy of a year before I did, and we
happened to be neighbors.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#99:1>
But we did not actually grow up together.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#100:1>
We attended the same school, and walked home down the same streets.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#101:1>
We were acquainted with the same people, and even had mutual
friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#102:1>
But we were never aware of each other 's existence--not until those
difficult years before the war. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#103:1>
One day, he had seen me from his window, as I was on my way to
attend the evening novena. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#104:1>
That was the moment it began, in the summer we had graduated
from school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#105:1>
Perhaps for lack of things to occupy his idle mind, then, I became
his great obsession.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#106:1>
Once decided, he lost no time in finding out who I was, where I
lived, what I was like, and what things interested me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#107:1>
Most important, he had to know if I was betrothed to anyone; when he
learned I was not, his whole world brightened.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#108:1>
He laughed in the streets, like a madman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#109:1>
Everyone thought him kind of strange. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#110:1>
<indig> Tatay </indig> was not particularly pleased.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#111:1>
I myself was fairly amused by Horacio 's antics, especially on that
afternoon when, after much fanfare, he arrived at our doorstep with an armful
of flowers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#112:1>
And that insufferable grin!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#113:1>
To me, nothing could have been more silly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#114:1>
No one could have been sillier. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#115:1>
But <indig> Tatay </indig> was in no mood for such matters, and
he let his will be known.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#116:1>
Horacio waited anxiously to be received; unfortunately, I could not
entertain visitors who were frowned upon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#117:1>
And so, I simply watched as <indig> Tatay </indig> rose from his
chair, stolidly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#118:1>
He approached my would-be suitor, and took a single look at his
face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#119:1>
Then he squinted and, as if to shut out the glare, closed the door.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#120:1>
In the quiet that followed, I wondered about Horacio.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#121:1>
I wondered how he must have felt, to be shamed on our front
doorstep.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#122:1>
I wondered how he could have been so silly in the first place.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#123:1>
Most of all, I wondered how he could have cast such darkness upon my
father 's face. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#124:1>
FELICIA HAS BEEN SITTING at my bier, telling stories about my
stereotyped quirks.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#125:1>
She has gone on for the past two hours about how I have spoiled her
children, and Oca 's children, and about how incapable I am of disciplining a
child. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#126:1>
Perhaps she has a point.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#127:1>
Because after all, it was none other than I who raised her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#128:1>
This likely accounts for her precocious behavior at the most
inappropriate times.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#129:1>
While you searched through my belongings for anything that might
have been of value ( since I had not prepared a will and was in no position
to point these out to you myself), you caught her trying my jewelry on for
size--even as I lay lifeless in an adjacent room. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#130:1>
She has never really been discreet, you will say. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#131:1>
You have seen her put all my clothing into countless piles,
gasping over the vast wardrobe I have accumulated.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#132:1>
And I will admit, perhaps a third of all I ever purchased never
actually left my dresser drawers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#133:1>
But still you must understand, we are speaking of a good fifty years '
worth of clothing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#134:1>
A woman like myself should certainly have been allowed some personal
indulgences, wouldn't you say? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#135:1>
Felicia will remind one and all of my fickle, meticulous, and
unreasonably demanding ways.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#136:1>
And she will mark these qualities as the cause of my spinsterhood.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#137:1>
She will accuse me of doing every undesirable thing--as though she
herself was not guilty of such behavior. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#138:1>
It is her being married and having children that have exempted
her from ridicule--from ostracized circumstances, such as my own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#139:1>
AND SO THEY SEE me lying here and they sigh, <quote> poor woman!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#140:1>
To have died all alone! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#141:1>
And so they turn to you and say, <quote> poor child!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#142:1>
Do not dare follow in her footsteps! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#143:1>
I think I may have told you that very same thing, Corazon, on
one occasion or two.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#144:1>
At times I would come visiting your family in the city for a week,
and find that some young man--who had obviously dressed with much effort--had
presented himself at your doorstep.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#145:1>
Oh, you would make such a face! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#146:1>
But of course, you were always the smart one.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#147:1>
Your father never realized that his terror tactics were futile,
since you had a mind of your own.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#148:1>
Anyone else could have seen that you were fully capable of scaring
away any poor soul who believed himself worthy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#149:1>
And now that your father is gone and I am gone, I know that you
will stay relentlessly on guard. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#150:1>
I understand your reasons well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#151:1>
I have never told you this, but I have always wanted to live on
my own.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#152:1>
For though I have kept what has been my own home since your uncles
moved away, I have always had some niece or nephew to harbor here; their
children were eventually left in my care as well.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#153:1>
I have always wanted some quiet space where I could live in
solitude.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-007#154:1>
But this dream has gone unfulfilled. </p> </I>
