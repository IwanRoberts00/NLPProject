On that Friday, eve of the October <indig> Caracol </indig> , the
people of Salinas came in dusty throngs and crowded the church of the
<foreign> Virgen del Santo Rosario </foreign> to see if what they had heard
was true.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#4:1>
Beneath festive buntings of plastic straws fashioned into stars,
excited children, tanned from frolicking in the sea, arrived mostly ahead of
the others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#5:1>
<quote> Hurry! </quote> they cried to each other. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#6:1>
Those who had been cooking since the early morning hours missed
it, so now they were wrenched from their huge iron pots, called <indig>
kawang </indig> , set up in backyards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#7:1>
<quote> Is it true? </quote> they cried over fences and dogs, even
louder than the infernal roar of countless tricycles that plied the narrow
roads down to the <indig> Aplaya </indig> , ferrying the curious who poured
in from Sapa, Wawa, Ligtong and the other <foreign> barrios </foreign> along
the shorelines.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#8:1>
All were wooed by the promise of a phenomenon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#9:1>
<quote> A miracle!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#10:1>
Hurry! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#11:1>
Freshly laundered curtains were left half-hung, and clotheslines
shuddered from frantic tugs of those whose fiesta best had to be secured
before scampering off to the church, leaving an occasional cat yawning on the
sill.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#12:1>
Even the fish brokers at the cove <indig> pandawan </indig> paused
momentarily from whispered bids, their pencils clenched in the same greedy
hands as the little slips of paper with hastily written numbers, while fish
just unloaded from the boats looked all the more forsaken in their piles.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#13:1>
<quote> They cannot move her! </quote> people announced from the
street corners.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#14:1>
<quote> She refuses to be lifted! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#15:1>
A multitude of hands crossed forehead to chest, left to right.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#16:1>
<quote> God, merciful Father! </quote> they said to one another.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#17:1>
<quote> How could this happen?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#18:1>
Forgiveness, Lord! </quote> some pleaded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#19:1>
At the church, the parish priest ordered the lights on so that no
one would be trampled in the scramble to see the life-sized Virgin that
crowned the old <foreign> retable </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#20:1>
People nudged on, jostling others, as they elbowed their way through
the aisles to be nearer their patron.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#21:1>
Many crammed the pews and absently joined the prayer of the beads,
that exercise so quickly organized by scapulared women in white trying but
failing to look more pious and more distressed than the rest.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#22:1>
All eight heavily carved Baroque doors were thrown open to allow a
change of air and freshen the church of its odors--an oppressing mixture of
human sweat and mucus, animal excrement and frying oil. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#23:1>
The good father shook his head and strained to keep his holy
temper.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#24:1>
He had already chided himself twice because he wanted to hit the
mayor for inviting the press who were just then entering the churchyard.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#25:1>
They had come, of course, to record the spectacle of the Virgin who
all of a sudden had become so incredibly heavy that the usual dozen
able-bodied men could not push, or much less lift, her onto the Platform that
was to take her in procession around the town on the morrow, for the <indig>
Caracol </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#26:1>
I was ten in 1963 when, from Manila where I lived, I spent the
summer in my mother 's hometown, <foreign> Barrio </foreign> Sapa just
outside Salinas in Cavite.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#27:1>
I stayed with her younger sister Vinying who was married to a much
older, rather stern looking man I called <indig> Coya </indig> Mario. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#28:1>
<indig> Ate </indig> Vinying was cheerful and attentive, always
fussing over me as she did household details.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#29:1>
She and <indig> Coya </indig> had no children of their own even after
six years of marriage.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#30:1>
Soon after I arrived, one afternoon I heard <indig> Ate </indig>
Vinying calling out to her husband from the kitchen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#31:1>
<indig> Coya </indig> was out in the wide backyard where they dried
fish and stored large clay jars to make <indig> patis </indig> , or fish
sauce.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#32:1>
He was drinking with a group of friends who were fishermen like him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#34:1>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#35:1>
You better come right now! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#36:1>
I hurried into the kitchen to see.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#37:1>
All morning long, <indig> Coya </indig> had been boasting of his
specialty--boiled puffer fish--which is notorious for being poisonous, but
said to be one of the most delicious fish in the sea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#38:1>
<quote> There are few men in the world who can cook this edibly,
Mameng!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#39:1>
You are a lucky child because your uncle is one of them. </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#40:1>
<quote> So how do you do it, <indig> Coya </indig> ? </quote> I
asked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#41:1>
<quote> Secret, <foreign> hija </foreign> , that 's a secret!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#42:1>
It dies with me--I 'll die first! </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#43:1>
He laughed heartily. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#44:1>
The aroma of red ginger and lemon grass, simmering in coconut
milk with curry, filled the dimly lit kitchen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#45:1>
Peeking through the tiny doorway I watched <indig> Coya </indig>
remove the clay pot from the fire.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#46:1>
He lifted its cover and sniffed, then he crooned for Ming, the
greyish green cat he adopted when it strayed into the yard as a kitten. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#47:1>
<indig> Coya </indig> pinched a small puffer from the pot and
tossed it to Ming which, after a nibble, carried the fish to its favorite
corner.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#48:1>
As it ate, <indig> Coya </indig> watched with a smile that spread
from the corners of his moustache to the dark, rough wrinkles beneath his
eyes, while his prematurely bald head glistened from the glow of the embers
on the hearth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#49:1>
At that moment, he noticed me and winked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#50:1>
<quote> Cats have many lives to spare for men, </quote> he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#51:1>
<quote> So, come and taste your uncle 's specialty, </quote> he
offered, as I frowned.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#52:1>
After another look at his cat, he turned to bring the pot to his
waiting friends who applauded in approval. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#53:1>
<quote> Here we are, my fearless friends!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#54:1>
Only for the real men in Sapa! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#55:1>
The cat soon consumed its treat and was licking its paws when the
drunken banter centered on the Abad family and how it was dying out without
any sons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#56:1>
<quote> From eating puffers! </quote> someone roared.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#57:1>
<quote> Then losing all his hair! </quote> another added.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#58:1>
<quote> Mario, you might have been kinder to marry one of the
mermaids! </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#59:1>
Laughter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#60:1>
In a more serious tone, someone said, <quote> <indig> Oy </indig>
, <indig> pareng </indig> Mario.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#61:1>
This is just to tell you, like a brother might, that you really have
to dance now, <indig> pare </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#62:1>
Dance!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#63:1>
Unless you take your father 's place, I swear, you will never have a
child!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#64:1>
Never! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#65:1>
A few agreed although I heard <indig> Coya </indig> grunt his
disapproval.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#66:1>
Quietly I slipped out the back door of the kitchen to sit near the
clay jars from where I saw <indig> Coya </indig> filling his glass with rhum.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#67:1>
<quote> It 's true, Mario.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#68:1>
Let me tell you, you 're almost like my son, one of my dearest
friends as well.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#69:1>
No more Abad after you. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#70:1>
Coya said nothing, avoiding looking into anyone 's eyes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#71:1>
<quote> <indig> Oy </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#72:1>
Are you listening? </quote> the man nearest him nudged on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#73:1>
<quote> Oy!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#74:1>
Dance, will you?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#75:1>
Don't you like to wear the colors, like a butterfly

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#76:1>
And to be the <indig> Alay </indig> , that--that is the honor!
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#77:1>
<indig> Coya </indig> Mario slammed his glass on the table, his
face reddening.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#78:1>
Before he could reply, however, his father <indig> Kaka </indig>
Tesong boomed from behind, <quote> Vinying!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#79:1>
<indig> Oy </indig> , Vinying! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#80:1>
The older Abad hobbled over as if he had trouble walking and
bending his legs, for he spent a lot of time sitting down.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#81:1>
The men seemed to cower in their seats as <indig> Kaka </indig>
Tesong again called loudly, <quote> Vinying! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#82:1>
<quote> <indig> Po </indig> ! </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#83:1>
<indig> Ate </indig> Vinying answered from somewhere within the tiny
two-room house.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#84:1>
She remained inside, however. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#85:1>
<quote> You know, Vinying? </quote> the old man began, his deeply
lined face frowning as he studied <indig> Coya </indig> Mario with
disappointment.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#86:1>
<quote> I am one unfortunate man. </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#87:1>
<indig> Kaka </indig> Tesong 's gaze locked onto his son 's.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#88:1>
Then the older Abad 's face turned almost kind, though his loud voice
still cracked like an old church bell tolling at a funeral. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#89:1>
<quote> This Mario, my only child Mario.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#90:1>
You know I must tell you, </quote> this time addressing <indig> Coya
</indig> 's friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#91:1>
<quote> He 's too good for this business of dancing for the Virgin.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#92:1>
So tough, too much of a man for such delicacies.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#93:1>
He thinks it has to be one 's will, his decision.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#94:1>
It 's sad that he has forgotten.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#95:1>
If not for my vow to be the Virgin 's fool, do you think he would be
here among you, to cook for you this fish you are so mad about?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#96:1>
What?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#97:1>
Tell me, speak!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#98:1>
You are men who serve the Virgin too, speak! </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#99:1>
The group, now sober, replied with soft embarrassed laughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#100:1>
All except <indig> Coya </indig> , who poked at the dish of puffers
before him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#101:1>
He emptied his glass, pretending not to care, but his eyes shifted
from one of his friends to the other, warning them not to reply.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#102:1>
<indig> Coya </indig> gave a bit of fish to the cat, which had
hopped onto the bench beside him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#103:1>
<indig> Kaka </indig> Tesong suddenly picked up Ming and turned
to leave.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#104:1>
Addressing it this time, he said, <quote> So!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#105:1>
Another one who wants so much for nothing, huh? </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#106:1>
Turning sharply, <indig> Coya </indig> was about to say
something when one of his friends restrained him with a finger to his lips.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#107:1>
Everyone watched <indig> Kaka </indig> Tesong 's movements as he
made his way back to his own small house across the yard where he mended
fishing nets for a living.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#108:1>
Soon the old man was stoking embers under huge vats.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#109:1>
Those contained nets that boiled in pig 's blood to strengthen them.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#110:1>
Beyond hearing, <indig> Coya </indig> Mario muttered, <quote>
Did you think you could compromise me, too?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#111:1>
Dance in the street like some idiot, painted like a woman!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#112:1>
You know there 's only one dance I know. </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#113:1>
<quote> And what 's that, <indig> pare </indig> ? </quote> his
friends chorused. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#114:1>
<quote> Oy, Vinying, come out here!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#115:1>
Let 's show these bastards what we dance every night! </quote> he
called out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#116:1>
The men roared with laughter, the merriment returning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#117:1>
<quote> So!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#118:1>
No wonder he doesn't have children, all he does is dance! </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#119:1>
Soon the jokes began to sound sleazy and <indig> Ate </indig>
Vinying, who had started to sweep the yard, quickly sent me to the <indig>
Aplaya </indig> to gather small brown clams burrowing in shallow water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#120:1>
<quote> Mameng, fill this dish and we 'll have <indig> halaan
</indig> for dinner.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#121:1>
Hurry back, child, it won't be long before the men will leave.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#122:1>
It 'll be dark soon, you hear? </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#123:1>
As she spoke, I was halfway out of the yard, scampering
excitedly down the small backways and other yards leading to the seashore.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#124:1>
I dashed across the shore to disturb hundreds of tiny ghost crabs,
their dotted, fragile bodies the color of the sand.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#125:1>
This way, then the other, they moved with me, crawling at one pace
all together so that the sand seemed to have come alive, rippling in this,
then the other direction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#126:1>
Each time I stopped to shove my feet about the sand in search of
a clam, the ghost crabs darted from me into their holes which dotted the
shoreline.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#127:1>
There were always more now, then less later, then more again, the
elusive little creatures evading me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#128:1>
I set down the dish of clams to chase them and poke a stick into a
few holes to draw some out, hoping to make them continue their eerie waltz.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#129:1>
Then I caught one but crushed it in a fistful of sand although it
seemed to disappear entirely in my hand, lost forever in the grains. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#130:1>
Suddenly I heard the voices of men singing and the heavy
thumping of feet breaking into a run.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#131:1>
I looked up to see <indig> Coya </indig> Mario and his friends just
arriving at the <indig> Aplaya </indig> , striding quickly like bronzed gods
in single file, coils of nets strung on their shoulders from the first man to
the last, with Ming trailing them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#132:1>
They were singing a Tagalog folk song: <X> <indig> Paru-parong bukid
Na lilipad-lipad Sa gitna ng parang Papaga-pagaspas! </indig> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#133:1>
Amidst the hoots and catcalls of wives and lovers cheering from
the upper shore, the men alternately skipped and danced to their melody now
taken up by the women until the very last lines: <X> <indig> At saka lumakad
Nang pakendeng-kendeng! </indig> </X> and the fishermen were upon their boats
as they roared louder than the waves that crashed about them with the
incoming tide.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#134:1>
Soon they waved to all when they boarded shirtless in the early
summer evening. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#135:1>
I waved back fascinated, as they heaved the nets onto the three
boats, with the mermaids painted on the bows, identical except for the color
of their hair.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#136:1>
<indig> Coya </indig> raised an arm to say goodbye while he cradled
Ming in the other.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#137:1>
Soon they set off on their motorized <foreign> bancas </foreign>
till they disappeared in the soft dark blue sunset, at about the time <indig>
Ate </indig> Vinying came looking for me, a coconut stem broom in her hand.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#138:1>
Although I was Carmen in Manila, everyone called me Mameng in
Sapa.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#139:1>
<quote> Mameng, the daughter of Floring, who married that
Manile&ntilde;o, Floring, sister of Virginia. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#140:1>
<quote> Yes, she 's the niece of Vinying, that beautiful but
childless woman who 's married to Mario the bald. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#141:1>
<quote> Oh, you mean Mario, the son of Tereso Abad, the town <indig>
Alay </indig> ? </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#142:1>
<quote> That 's the one. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#143:1>
<quote> Oh, she 's the grandchild of the <indig> Alay </indig> then!
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#144:1>
To be related to the <indig> Alay </indig> was a blessing, and
after a while, I was Mameng the grandchild of the <indig> Alay </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#145:1>
Then I would have to listen to how his sacrifices to the Virgin
assured them all of good fortune all year round, safe from pestilence,
ravages of weather or turns in destiny.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#146:1>
Then they would ask, <quote> have you ever seen his shirt? </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#147:1>
Then they would tell me how colorful it was and how they had
contributed to it, before I would be allowed to leave and play. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#148:1>
There were old <foreign> manzanita </foreign> trees planted
between <indig> Coya </indig> Mario 's and <indig> Kaka </indig> Tesong 's
houses.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#149:1>
I often climbed those trees, which didn't grow very tall, for their
small green apple-shaped fruits.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#150:1>
From there I watched the old man working at the vats in the yard
below while I threw unripe fruits at Ming, sleeping among the nets.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#151:1>
My playmates were older, distant cousins, <indig> Ate </indig> Luvy
and <indig> Ate </indig> Cora. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#152:1>
There were times we blew soap bubbles made even more slippery
with leaves shredded from the hibiscus shrubs that lined many of the fences
in Sapa.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#153:1>
Over <indig> Kaka </indig> Tesong 's vats sailed our glistening
bubbles, spotted with bits of green.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#154:1>
When we had a stretch of morning we wound up each other 's hair with
the soft stems also of the hibiscus until we looked like we had grown
tendrils on our heads.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#155:1>
Then later in the afternoon we ran down to the <indig> Wawa </indig>
where the river joined the sea, hurrying to catch the low tide so that the
narrow concrete walkway leading to the other side of the small channel would
still be above the water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#156:1>
Then we whiled away the rest of the day watching the fishing
crews come in to offer their catch to the best bidders at the <indig>
pandawan </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#157:1>
We became such familiar visitors there that the fishing folk missed
us when we didn't come and told us the next time around, <quote> <indig> Oyo
</indig> , kin of the <indig> Alay </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#158:1>
Where were you yesterday?

You see, we had no luck with the fish! </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#160:1>
Or, <quote> We were certain you would come!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#161:1>
The fish were jumping into our boats so they could be here with you!

Often we were prized with a choice portion of the haul,
sometimes a rare <indig> papacol </indig> , from <indig> Coya </indig> 's
friends who would not let him go without chiding him, <quote> That Mario!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#163:1>
He never brings us such luck as these young ladies!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#164:1>
All he brings us is that cat, which preys on the fish! </quote> </p>

And just when the tide turned completely to submerge the
walkway, we waded back in thigh-deep water that soaked our faded cotton
dresses.

We trailed the fishermen as they brought home their earnings and
share of the catch.

Once, I was hoisted upon a young man 's shoulder to keep me dry, and
with my day-long curls caught in the breeze, I posed just like one of the
mermaids astride the bows of their boats.

Someone remarked that the <foreign> Santo Rosario </foreign> was
parading too early with no one dancing in her path, at which the other men
promptly began to sway from side to side, and playfully sang their butterfly
tune, while I tried my best to keep from falling.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#169:1>
Glancing at my uncle, I saw <indig> Coya </indig> Mario had slung
the bunch of arrowfish he had been carrying on his belt and followed us,
staring ahead grimly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#170:1>
He stroked Ming on his arm, in the same manner that someone stroked
a long-time pain.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-002#171:1>
Dancing seemed to be farthest from his mind. </p> </I>
