<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#4:1>
Man, since his first appearance on the planet some 2.5 million
years ago, has made use of caves and rockshelters.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#5:1>
Throughout the long period of man 's prehistory, caves and
rockshelters have served him as shelters, burial grounds, and ceremonial
places.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#6:1>
Nineteenth century archaeologists unearthed man-made stone tools from
caves in France, which served as direct evidences of prehistoric man 's
activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#7:1>
The discovery becomes significant when it is noted that the prevailing
belief then, even among the prominent men of science, was that the earth was
only 6000 years old.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#8:1>
That the earth had existed for millions of years slowly became the
accepted paradigm as a result of succeeding overwhelming evidences from the
geological and archaeological sciences. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#9:1>
Archaeological researchers in the Philippines in the last thirty
years substantiate the fact that numerous caves and rockshelters all over the
country were used by the early Filipinos during the prehistoric period as
habitation, burial and ceremonial sites ( Ronquillo 1985).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#10:1>
These include the hundreds of caves and rockshelters recorded at
Pe&ntilde;ablanca, Cagayan Province ( Ronquillo & Santiago 1977), on Bohol
Island ( Santiago 1982), on Panay Island ( Coutts 1983), on Samar Island (
Hutterer 1969), on Palawan Island ( Fox 1970) and in southeastern Mindanao (
Solheim <foreign> et al. </foreign> 1979). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#11:1>
Individual caves and rockshelters which are significant for
prehistoric research in Cagayan Province ( Thiel 1978; Cuevas 1980; Dalupan
1981; Ronquillo 1981), at Angono, Rizal ( Peralta 1972), in Sorsogon ( Fox &
Evangelista 1957a) and Cagraray Island, Albay Province ( Fox & Evangelista
1957b), in Masbate ( Solheim 1968), in Misamis Oriental ( Bautista 1992), in
southern Cotabato ( Kurjack <foreign> et al. </foreign> 1971), at Sanga
Sanga, Tawi Tawi ( Spoehr 1973; Cabanilla & Cabanilla 1992; Ronquillo
<foreign> et al. </foreign> 1993), and at Madam, Sarangani Province ( Dizon
<foreign> et al. </foreign> 1992) have, likewise, all been indicative of the
active role played by indigenous prehistoric populations in the Philippine
archipelago and their cultural affinity with the Southeast Asian and the
Pacific areas. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#12:1>
<h> ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN CAVES IN THE COUNTRY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#13:1>
Caves, rockshelters and overhangs used by our prehistoric
ancestors fall into various archaeological categories, namely, 1) habitation
sites - - areas which they used as their homes as indicated by their
activities as shown by the artifacts they left behind, such as potteries and
stone tools and other, related materials, such as food remains; 2) burial
sites - - areas used as places for burying their dead, which included placing
the dead in jars or in intricately-designed wooden coffins; and 3) ceremonial
sites - - areas where rituals took place as may be indicated by paintings
and/or incisions on the walls of the caves or rockshelters as well as other
cultural material evidences left behind indicating use as offerings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#14:1>
In numerous cases, as shown by systematic archaeological
excavations, caves indicate multiple uses delineated by the above activities.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#15:1>
Five noteworthy archaeological sites in caves and rockshelters
located in different parts of the country are summarized and presented below:
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#16:1>
<h> <bold> 1. Quezon, Palawan Island </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#17:1>
From 1962 through 1966 archaeologists from the National Museum
conducted exploration and excavation activities in the island of Palawan,
concentrating their work at Lipuun Point, a limestone promontory in the
municipality of Quezon.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#18:1>
Hundreds of caves and rockshelters are known to exist in the area,
many of which are potential archaeological sites.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#19:1>
Archaeological work in the Tabon Caves resulted in the establishment
of the first reliable evidence for a very early human presence in the
Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#20:1>
Six successive periods of human occupation were identified at Tabon
Cave, covering a period of over 30,000 years.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#21:1>
The radiocarbon dates generated from this cave range from as early as
30,000 years ago to as late as 9,500 years ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#22:1>
The results of the archaeological work at the Tabon Caves have
been published ( Fox 1970).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#23:1>
They include data on the recovery of human bone fragments, which,
although recovered from a disturbed area of the cave, have been dated from
22,000 to 24,000 years ago - - so far the earliest skeletal evidence for <it>
<foreign> Homo sapiens </foreign> </it> in the Philippines. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#24:1>
<h> <bold> 2. Pe&ntilde;ablanca, Cagayan Province </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#25:1>
In 1976 and 1977 over a hundred caves and rockshelters were
recorded from the limestone formation of Pe&ntilde;ablanca, Cagayan Province.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#26:1>
More than fifty are archaeological sites and nine have been excavated
by the National Museum ( Ronquillo & Santiago 1977).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#27:1>
The different radiocarbon dates available from the excavated caves at
the Pe&ntilde;ablanca Limestone Formation range in date from as early as
14,000 B.C. in Callao Cave to as late as A.D. 50 in Arku Cave ( Bronson &
White 1992:486-487). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#28:1>
The main objective of the Pe&ntilde;ablanca Archaeological
Project was to determine the variability in the stone tool technology at the
area and delineate them in time and space.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#29:1>
Interest was in the method of manufacture as well as in the plausible
functions of the stone tools recovered from the different cave sites
excavated ( Ronquillo 1981). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#30:1>
Preliminary results of the analysis of the animal remains from a
number of excavated cave and rockshelter sites at Pe&ntilde;ablanca indicate
the exploitation of a broad resource base by hunters and gatherers, who may
have had contacts with sedentary agriculturalists ( Henson 1978). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#31:1>
<h> <bold> 3. Anda Peninsula, Bohol Province </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#32:1>
In 1981 archaeologists from the National Museum undertook survey
and exploration activities in the limestone formation of the Anda Peninsula
and the Mabini area in southeastern Bohol.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#33:1>
The aim of the project was to determine potential archaeological
areas and point out key priority sites containing evidences relevant to the
interpretation of the prehistory of the island ( Santiago 1982).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#34:1>
The archaeological survey and exploration area was chosen based on
reports of local residents on the existence of burial sites situated along
the coastal areas of Cogtong Bay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#35:1>
Over one hundred and fifty ( 150) caves, rockshelters, and
overhangs were recorded, twenty seven ( 27) of which have been identified as
archaeological sites.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#36:1>
Nine caves have been excavated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#37:1>
The sites encountered indicated habitation, burial and places where
religious activities had been performed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#38:1>
Archaeological research in Bohol has revealed the widespread practice
of wooden coffin burials in caves and rockshelters, whose dates may range
from the Developed Metal Age to the Protohistoric Period.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#39:1>
These wooden coffins were carved from logs and had a predominantly
reptile design on the lid.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#40:1>
These were noted to have been used both for primary and for secondary
burials.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#41:1>
Judging by the archaeological explorations undertaken in 1981, the
archaeological potential of caves and rockshelters in Bohol Island is great.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#42:1>
<h> <bold> 4. Madam, Sarangani Province </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#43:1>
One of the most recent significant finds by archaeologists from
the National Museum is the anthropomorphic burial jars discovered at Ayub
Cave, Madam, Sarangani Province.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#44:1>
These low-fired earthenware jars contained secondary burials - - with
incomplete human skeletal remains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#45:1>
The site is situated in the coastal area of Pinol, Maitum, Sarangani
Province and is <quote> approximately 1000 meters due south of the Mindanao
Sea shoreline ( from Pinol) with an elevation of 6 meters above mean sea
level </quote> ( Dizon 1991:3). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#46:1>
Ayub Cave was found to have been severely disturbed by treasure
hunters.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#47:1>
Digging was done in the front part as well as in the central and rear
portions of the cave.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#48:1>
The broken pieces of anthropomorphic jars were haphazardly placed on
the surface alongside the walls of the cave by the illegal diggers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#49:1>
Fragments from at least twenty-five ( 25) restorable secondary
burial jars were recovered.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#50:1>
The covers of the jars were in the shape of human heads.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#51:1>
The bodies of the jars show complete sets of shoulders, arms, breasts
and hands.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#52:1>
It was noted that <quote> some ears, mouth and chin of the heads are
appliqued while others are directly molded with the head </quote> ( Dizon
1991:4).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#53:1>
A number of these earthenware heads were noticeably painted with red
( hematite) and black ( possibly manganese). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#54:1>
Directly associated with the burial jars were intricately
decorated earthenware jarlets, glass beads and bracelets, earthenware beads
and shell implements and ornaments ( Dizon <foreign> et al. </foreign>
1992:4).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#55:1>
On the basis of the associated materials the site is dated to the
Metal Age, <foreign> ca. </foreign> 500 B.C. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#56:1>
<h> <bold> 5. Sanga Sanga, Tawi Tawi Province </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#57:1>
The Balobok Rockshelter, located at Sanga Sanga Island in Tawi
Tawi Province, was first reported to the National Museum in 1966.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#58:1>
Partial excavations of the site were undertaken in 1969 ( Spoehr
1973) and in 1970 ( Cabanilla & Cabanilla 1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#59:1>
A re-excavation of the site in 1992 was deemed necessary because
<quote> &ldquo; the earlier limited excavations in 1969 and in 1970 have
generated limited, but intriguing, archaeological data the completeness of
which may be essential to Philippine, Southeast Asian and Pacific prehistory
&rdquo; </quote> ( Ronquillo <foreign> et al. </foreign> 1993:1). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#60:1>
The recovery from the site of polished shell adzes made from the
giant clam <it> <foreign> Tridacna gigas </foreign> </it> , which date to as
far back as 7,000 B.P. ( before the present), is deemed significant to the
identical, but later ( <foreign> ca. </foreign> 2,000 B.P.) polished shell
adzes found in the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands in southern Ryuku, as well as
on numerous Pacific islands ( Asato 1990). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#61:1>
The Balobok Rockshelter is a habitation site with three distinct
cultural phases of occupation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#62:1>
The four radiocarbon dates generated in 1992 delineate the sequential
chronology, which range from 6810 B.C. to 3190 B.C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#63:1>
The technology of manufacture of the polished adzes recovered at
Balobok is inferred from the earlier flaking method observed in the recovered
flaked shell and stone tools at the site.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#64:1>
Shell blanks were initially flaked, using the percussion technique,
and were later polished to achieve the desired shape and sharpness of the
prehistoric adze. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#65:1>
<h> ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#66:1>
The Philippine Constitution distinctly provides for the
preservation and development of Filipino culture for national identity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#67:1>
The cave archaeological resources of the country are protected by
laws of the land, particularly by Republic Act No. 4846, otherwise known as
<mention> &ldquo; The Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act,
&rdquo; </mention> which declares that it is the policy of the state to
preserve and protect the cultural properties of the nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#68:1>
Its amendment, Presidential Decree No. 374, strengthens the original
Act.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#69:1>
Presidential Decree No. 260, and its amendment, P.D. 1492, declares
as national shrines, and/or landmarks important places in the country, which
include, among others, the petroglyphs of the Rockshelter in Angono, Rizal,
the petroglyphs of Alab, Bontoc, the Mummy Caves of Kabayan, Benguet and of
Sagada and Alab, Bontoc, and the petroglyphs in the Cave at the Tau't Batu
area in Barangay Ransang, Quezon, Palawan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#70:1>
Caves, rockshelters and overhangs declared by the National Museum
as archaeological sites - - <quote> &ldquo; any place which may be
underground, or on the surface, underwater or at sea level which contains
fossils, artifacts and other cultural, geological, botanical, zoological
materials which depict and document evidence of paleontological and
prehistoric events &rdquo; </quote> - - are easily the target of rampant
destruction through illegal looting, guano collecting, treasure hunting for
the 'famed' Yamashita gold, illegal stalactite gathering, and exploitation
and decay due to ignorance, neglect or indifference. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#71:1>
Treasure hunting activities for buried Japanese plundered &ldquo;
treasures", which has recently become a craze in the country, is legalized
through Presidential Decree No. 1726-a and are enforced by a separate
government office, notably the Presidential Security Group in
Malaca&ntilde;ang.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#72:1>
This legalization of treasure hunting activities has done
unparalleled damage to the country 's archaeological cave sites.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#73:1>
The indiscriminate diggings by the treasure hunters, without concern
for the country 's archaeological heritage found in cave sites, invariably
destroy an important component of the country 's non-renewable resources.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#74:1>
Uncontrolled and illegal guano collecting inside caves and
rockshelters also result in the destruction of important archaeological
resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#75:1>
The National Museum has an existing Memorandum of Agreement with the
Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences, which orders application for guano
extractions to be first referred to the National Museum.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#76:1>
This, however, has only been implemented, mostly in the Visayas, in
the 1980s.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#77:1>
Since the enactment of the Local Government Code, permits for guano
collecting in caves are issued by the local governments. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#78:1>
<h> POLICY AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#79:1>
As products of and witness to past cultural achievements, the
archaeological heritage of the Philippines is significant, both to the
country and as part and parcel of the world heritage.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#80:1>
Adequate protection of these resources through improved enforcement
of existing laws and regulations, proper linkages and networking among
agencies involved in protecting the country 's cultural heritage as well as
the undertaking of feasible programs of information and awareness, both
geared for the public and the law enforcers, are necessary and essential
courses of action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#81:1>
The archaeological heritage, unlike other cultural resources, is
particularly fragile.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#82:1>
Site destruction as a result of soil erosion, development projects,
illegal pot-hunting activities, and uncontrolled guano collecting, all
contribute to the irreversible destruction and loss of the country 's
archaeological resources in caves and rockshelters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#83:1>
The archaeological treasures of Philippine caves have important
educational, recreational, and tourism applications.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#84:1>
Properly protected and managed, these archaeological sites may be
developed and expanded into recreational and educational areas for the
appreciation of students and tourists, local as well as foreign.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#85:1>
The potentials of archaeological cave sites as recreational areas and
tourist attractions are only now starting to be realized by the tourism
industry and, when properly managed and protected, may well be a good
alternative source of needed currency for the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#86:1>
A number of the caves noted above have been declared <mention>
&ldquo; National Treasures &rdquo; </mention> because they possess <quote>
&ldquo; outstanding historical, cultural, artistic and/or scientific value
which is significant and important to this country and nation. &rdquo;
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#87:1>
As such, they are protected by law from being destroyed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#88:1>
Unfortunately, the enforcement of the laws on the protection and
preservation of non-renewable archaeological resources still leaves much to
be desired. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#89:1>
As matters of policy and management the following are considered
essential for the proper protection of the important, non-renewable, and
fragile archaeological resources found in caves and rockshelters all over the
country: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#90:1>
1. R.A. 4846 and its amendments P.D. 374, also known as <mention>
&ldquo; The Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act, &rdquo;
</mention> need to be disseminated nationwide for their proper
implementation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#91:1>
The adequate and effective protection of the country 's non-renewable
archaeological resources need to be appreciated and enforced specifically by
the officials of the Local Governments, the members of registered
Non-Government Organizations ( NGOs), the public school teachers and
students, the law enforcers of the land, and the numerous members of
civic-oriented organizations, such as the Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions and the
local cultural and heritage foundations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#92:1>
The Department of Education, Culture and Sports, the Department of
Tourism and the newly-created National Commission on Culture and the Arts
could all contribute positively in this essential, important, and timely
Archaeological Heritage Dissemination Project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#93:1>
2. An Archaeological Tourism Program, designed to enhance the
tourism potential of archaeological cave sites, may well be opportune through
a networking between the National Museum and the Department of Tourism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#94:1>
As a combination of the past and the natural environment, <it> Cave
Archaeological Sites </it> are ideal for tourism and recreational purposes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#95:1>
The focus of this program may include the identification,
formulation, marketing and retailing of the past through relevant
interpretation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#96:1>
That these sites be made accessible to and appreciated by the general
public, without compromising their intrinsic cultural value, should be
considered one of the program 's primary goals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#97:1>
3. Applications for guano collecting inside caves and
rockshelters should require the appropriate evaluation of and clearance from
the National Museum prior to the issuance of permits by Local Governments for
the extraction of the fertilizers for commercial purposes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#98:1>
In this way we may yet prevent the destruction of non-renewable
archaeological resources in caves and rockshelters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#99:1>
4. The protection and preservation of archaeological resources
inside caves and rockshelters, which is incorporated in the Implementing
Rules and Regulations for the National Integrated Protected Area System (
NIPAS), recently enacted as R.A. No. 7586, and now being implemented by the
DENR, requires close coordination with National Museum archaeologists.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#100:1>
As mandated in R.A. 4846 and P.D. 374 this is now complied within
the conduct of any archaeological activities envisioned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#101:1>
5. P.D. 1726-A now needs to be critically assessed, evaluated
and, if so warranted, repealed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#102:1>
This Martial Law Decree is contradictory to R.A. 4846 and P.D. 374
and, therefore, is detrimental to the vital protection and preservation of
the country 's cultural resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#103:1>
P.D. 1726-A provides blanket authority to search and dig
indiscriminately in search for the Yamashita treasure and has already done
unparalleled damage to cave archaeological resources all over the country.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#104:1>
The historical period in the Philippines started only in the
16th century - - or just over 400 years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#105:1>
This is a minuscule period of time considering the 500,000 years
prehistory of the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#106:1>
The selective and incomplete historical records can be enhanced
through adequate archaeological research.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#107:1>
The only way to explicate the prehistoric life ways of the
prehistoric Filipinos and to bring to light the lives of 25,000 past
generations of our Filipino ancestors is through appropriate archaeological
research and well-reasoned interpretation of the country 's archaeological
resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#108:1>
Large numbers of these are found in caves and rockshelters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#109:1>
The unabated destruction of important and non-renewable
archaeological sites in caves, rockshelters and overhangs is unfortunate
because these archaeological sites have recreational, educational and tourism
potentials if properly tapped.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#110:1>
The archaeological resources of the country have an intrinsic
qualitative value which lies in their ability to act as tangible symbols of
past Philippine cultural communities and in their potential as a source of
knowledge.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#111:1>
The government, the private sector, civic-oriented groups, law
enforcers and individuals need to shoulder a collective responsibility to
protect and preserve the cave archaeological resources of the country to
ensure their safety from pillage and wanton looting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#112:1>
A nation 's cave archaeological resources are non-renewable
wealth of the country and, as such, need to be adequately protected and
managed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#113:1>
These resources are part of a country 's history and national
identity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-014#114:1>
It is but fitting to protect and preserve them for the appreciation
and enrichment of the succeeding generations of Filipinos. </p> </I>
