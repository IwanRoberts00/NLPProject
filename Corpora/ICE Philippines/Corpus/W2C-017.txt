DAVAO CITY--

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#4:1>
The profit profile of the country 's banks last year has bolstered
criticism that they are making a windfall in the ongoing currency crisis.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#5:1>
In his first public speech after his resignation took effect
yesterday, former Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez said
some of the banks have admitted they cornered as much as 75 percent of their
profit during the last quarter of last year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#6:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Meaning to say that you 're going to see, when the
banks start publishing the figures, that they made a tremendous amount of
money in October, November and December when the rates went up, &rdquo;
</quote> Dominguez said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#7:1>
A document showing the banks ' prime lending rates shows that the
rate went up as much as 25 percent this week, from 20 percent in August last
year, and 15 percent before the currency crisis started on July 11, 1997.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#8:1>
<quote> &ldquo; As you all know, this is not the real situation
because many have already charged as high as 29 percent, &rdquo; </quote>
Dominguez said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#9:1>
He did not disclose which banks made a heavy profit and how much they
made last year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#10:1>
On the contrary, Dominguez pointed out the wide disparity in the
interest the banks were giving to domestic savings.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#11:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Up to now, they 're still paying four percent on your
savings, for the thousands and thousands and hundreds of million of pesos in
your deposits, lending them at 31 percent and making real hefty margins.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#12:1>
Dominguez urged the members of the Mindanao Business Council (
MBC), an affiliate of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
<quote> &ldquo; to make a lot of noise &rdquo; </quote> about the high
interest rate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#13:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Be very active in articulating the needs of the
business community in Mindanao, but keep the morale high, &rdquo; </quote> he
told the officers of the MBC, which has 32 business chambers as members
across the island. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#14:1>
He said the business leaders <quote> &ldquo; should continue
talking out loud and articulating all the other unaddressed issues in
Mindanao. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#15:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I think we have to do something about it.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#16:1>
It is a policy issue, and it is the single most negative aspect of
this whole crisis, &rdquo; </quote> he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#17:1>
He said the inability of the country to bring down interest rates
could force it to enter <quote> &ldquo; a period of unrecoverable deflation
until such time that a new thing will happen. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There are only losers in high interest rates.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#19:1>
They kill everybody, discourage investments; they make business
expensive, they make any expansion prohibitive.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#20:1>
That is the single risky thing that is going to stop the Mindanao
recovery, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#23:2>
MALAYSIAN Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will arrive in Manila
on Friday for a meeting with President Ramos to hammer out ways in reviving
the economies of the two countries at the height of the economic crisis in
the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#24:2>
Sources at the Department of Foreign Affairs said Mahathir 's
agenda with Ramos in Malaca&ntilde;ang will likely focus on the currency
crisis because it will only be a one-day visit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#25:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We don't know exactly what he will have to say to
the President but we will discuss to him the proposal to set up a system that
would allow the use of local currencies in our trading instead of the US
dollar, &rdquo; </quote> a source said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#26:2>
Foreigh Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon, Jr. had earlier
announced that an interagency body agreed to formulate a scheme that would
allow businessmen in Southeast Asia to use the local currencies instead of US
dollars in trading goods. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#27:2>
Siazon said Malaysia and Thailand would likely support the
Philippines on the proposed trading system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#28:2>
He said the Indonesian <foreign> rupiah </foreign> , however,
remained unstable and it would be hard to convince businessmen to use the
volatile <foreign> rupiah </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#29:2>
However, some businessmen are not enthusiastic about the idea
because the intra-Asean trade is not too big to make a significant progress
in stabilizing their currencies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#30:2>
Sources said Ramos and Mahathir could also discuss the regional
security that could be affected by the economic crisis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#31:2>
Indonesian observers fear that the declining <foreign> rupiah
</foreign> and the growing unemployment in that country could lead to
political instability. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#32:2>
Restive Indonesians are expected to wage more protests when the
government removes the subsidies in basic items that were recommended by the
International Monetary Fund. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Teachers refuse poll duty </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#34:3>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#35:3>
MAJORITY of the public school teachers do not want to serve as
poll officials in the May 11 elections and want to be given the choice to
reject such assignments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#36:3>
Citing partial results of its survey, the Alliance of Concerned
Teachers ( ACT) said that 85 percent of the 420,000 public school teachers in
the country want to be relieved of their poll duties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#37:3>
Election after election, the Commission on Elections ( Comelec)
compels the public school teachers to serve as poll inspectors in the
balloting and the registration of voters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#38:3>
Citing the recent cases of harassment and the government 's
failure to pay the teachers their honoraria, the group wants the Comelec to
give them the freedom to decide whether to accept or reject poll duties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#39:3>
The group met with the Manila Public School Teachers '
Association and officials of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports
yesterday to thrash out the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#40:3>
They passed a resolution containing the teachers ' sentiment and
will submit it to the Comelec this week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#41:3>
Raymund Villanueva, the spokesman for ACT, said the teachers feel
harassed after some of their colleagues were arrested last month on charges
that they were involved in election fraud. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#42:3>
Last week, 18 teachers at L. Avance&ntilde;a High School in
Quezon City and nine school principals in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, were
arrested by the police on charges of fraud filed by defeated candidates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#43:3>
The teachers complain that they expose themselves to danger when
they serve as poll inspectors, but that they are not paid their honoraria on
time, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#44:3>
Villanueva said the Comelec still owes the teachers &peso;17
million in honoraria in last year 's <indig> barangay </indig> elections and
the last registration of voters.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#45:3>
Comelec and the Department of Budget and Management are tossing the
blame on each other for the unpaid <foreign> per diems </foreign> of 400,000
public school teachers, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#46:3>
Partial results of an ongoing national survey among the 420,000
public school teachers showed that 85 percent of them do not want to serve in
the May elections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#47:3>
At least 90 percent of the teachers in Central Luzon object
strongly to serving as election officials in the May elections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#48:3>
Villanueva said the teachers have a constant fear of being
charged with election anomalies by the defeated candidates and of the dangers
that go with the job.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#49:3>
He cited the killing of two teachers in the 1995 elections.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#50:3>
One was killed when he tried to keep ballot boxes from being taken by
goons in Batangas; the other drowned in Sulu while transporting ballot boxes.

A TWIN-JET airliner with 99 passengers and five crewmen
disappeared and apparently crashed while trying to land at Cagayan de Oro
City 's Lumbia Airport shortly before noon yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#55:4>
Witnesses were quoted by the radio group <mention> React
</mention> in Cagayan de Oro as saying that they saw the crash site in the
mountainous area of Gingoog City, 30 miles from Lumbia Airport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#56:4>
Mayor Antonio Cabingin of Claveria, Misamis Oriental received
reports from residents near the 3,300-foot Mount Balatican, that they heard a
loud explosion and saw <quote> &ldquo; a big white thing &rdquo; </quote>
going down in a heavily forested area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#57:4>
Reports reaching the National Rescue Coordinating Center at
Villamor Air Base said the aircraft, a twin-engine DC-9 with registry number
RP-C1507, operated by Cebu Pacific Air owned by businessman John Gokongwei,
was last heard from at 10:48 p.m., when it was 37 miles away from the
airport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#58:4>
The plane 's pilot, Capt. Paulo Justo, and its first officer,
Capt. Erwin Gulla, came from the Air Force.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#59:4>
The three other crewmembers are flight attendants Romeo Mendoza,
Arlene Victorino and Paula Stephanie Lombres. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#60:4>
The flight, CP-387, left the Manila Domestic Airport at 9:16 a.m.
and was expected to arrive at Cagayan de Oro at 11:03 a.m. after a brief
technical stop in Tacloban City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#61:4>
The flight plan indicated Butuan as its alternative airport of
destination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#62:4>
The last contact with the plane was at 10:48 p.m., when the pilot
indicated that the plane was at 11,500 feet and descending at the rate of
3,300 feet per minute.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#63:4>
This would have placed it 8,200 feet by 10:49 or already lower than
the nearby mountain ranges, making it difficult to avoid running smack into
them in bad weather, aviation experts said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#64:4>
Dato Amirul Duran, manager of the Air Transportation Office (
ATO) Area 9, said the plane was due to land at Lumbia Airport in 15 minutes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#65:4>
When it did not do so after 30 minutes, the ATO conducted a
&ldquo; communications search &rdquo; with other airports in Tacloban, Davao,
Surigao and Cebu to confirm any sighting of the plane, but the search yielded
nothing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#66:4>
Duran said, <quote> &ldquo; We cannot ascertain the whereabouts
of the plane or what happened until we physically see the plane. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#67:4>
Col. Chris Datu, commanding officer of the Composite Air Support
Force 10, said a search by his unit was called off due to thick clouds and
strong gusty winds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#68:4>
<quote> &ldquo; We do not want to cause apprehension among the
relatives of the passengers; that is why we do not want to confirm or deny
whether the plane has crashed, &rdquo; </quote> said Datu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#69:4>
Cebu Pacific spokesman Larry Zurita said the airline could not
release the manifest at press time <quote> &ldquo; unless we have confirmed
exactly what happened to the plane. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#70:4>
One of the passengers is 21-year-old Fritzie Marte, a staffer at
the office of PDP <indig> Laban </indig> Rep. Erasmo Damasing of Cagayan de
Oro.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#71:4>
Damasing said he had tried to stop Marte from flying so she could
attend a hearing at the House of Representatives; but Marte could not cancel
a meeting with youth leaders in Cagayan de Oro City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#72:4>
Information gathered by search and rescue authorities in Manila
showed that CP-387, after leaving Tacloban, flew over Butuan Airport,
apparently to use its navigational aid to find its way to Cagayan de Oro.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#73:4>
Visibility in the area was down at the time, weathermen said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#74:4>
Manila Rescue Coordinating Center authorities said Lumbia Airport
officials asked the Air Force to launch search-and-rescue operations after an
initial &ldquo; communications search &rdquo; failed to locate the plane.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#75:4>
Three UH-IH Huey helicopters from the 505th Rescue Squadron were
dispatched to conduct a search, concentrating on the immediate vicinity of
Cagayan de Oro City.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#76:4>
The search focused on several high mountains arrayed north to south
between Butuan and Cagayan de Oro cities--the 8,300-foot-high Mount
Balatucan, the 8,300-foot-high Mount Caluauan, Mount Capantan and Mount
Sinalagus, both 7,300 feet high. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#77:4>
Airplanes traveling from Butuan to Lumbia Airport have to steer
clear of the mountains, especially Caluayan and Balatucan, to avoid hitting
their peaks.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#78:4>
Aviation authorities inquired from as far as Cebu, Tacloban,
Zamboanga, Davao, Palawan and General Santos about CP-387 's whereabouts, but
received a negative reply. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#79:4>
On February 1, 1997, a Cessna Citation jet from Butuan took off
bound for Cagayan de Oro airport to pick up then Defense Secretary Renato de
Villa.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#80:4>
The executive jet was found a few days later near the peak of Mount
Balatucan.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#81:4>
There were no survivors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#82:4>
Relatives of the passengers of CP-387 were advised to call
telephone numbers 638-663 or 638-6637 for inquiries. </p> </I>

MEMBERS of the Bicameral Conference Committee on Energy are
deadlocked on the drafting of the final committee report on the new oil
deregulation bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#86:5>
The bill 's approval was delayed by senators who want to enforce
full deregulation of the oil industry after President Ramos 's term expires
in June.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#87:5>
Sen. Freddie Webb, chairman of the Senate contingent, has rejected
the committee report drafted by the House panel, which proposed to empower
the President to shorten the five-month transition period before full
deregulation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#88:5>
Webb fears that Ramos will immediately cut the transition period
to allow the oil companies to increase prices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#89:5>
The House and Senate panels are deadlocked on the bill and the
senators demand more revisions in it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#90:5>
Independent Rep. Joker Arroyo of Makati City warned the
government of social unrest if the new oil law is not passed.

<quote> &ldquo; If the oil deregulation law is not passed, the old

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#94:5>
<indig> Lakas </indig> Rep. Dante Tinga of Tagig-Pateros,
chairman of the House contingent, assured the nation that the President would
not order a full deregulation now, because of the volatile economic
condition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#95:5>
<quote> &ldquo; He [ Ramos] would take the full blame if oil
prices would increase after we deregulate the oil industry, &rdquo; </quote>
Tinga said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-017#96:5>
A &peso;2.9-billion buffer fund--from the President 's Reserve
Control Account--was proposed to absorb the increases in the prices of
&ldquo; socially sensitive &rdquo; petroleum products, like diesel and
liquified petroleum gas during the transition period. </p>
