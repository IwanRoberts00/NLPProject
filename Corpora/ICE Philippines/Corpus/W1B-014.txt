Dear Lydia,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#4:1>
Welcome to the batch 61 egroups! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#5:1>
You will be delighted to know that Aida Castaneda dela Rosa is
also a member of our egroups altho when you view the members/ list, it 's her
son 's name that is registered.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#6:1>
She seldom sends messages but hubby Ed dela Rosa, who has a separate
email address, is the one more active in sending messages.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#7:1>
I 'm sure she 'll be excited to know that there is already contact
with you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#8:1>
She has had contact with Luchie Catama who is always busy accompanying
her daughter ( or son?) to her bowling games and has never attended any
reunion or meeting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#9:1>
Aida is still trying to trace where Norma Gatchalian is.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#10:1>
Love Sarmiento is somewhere in LA but no contact number yet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#11:1>
Tish, Linda, Leonie Jimeno are actively sending messages once in a
while.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#12:1>
There is contact with Cora Z altho she 's not a member of our
egroups.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#13:1>
Arabella 's email address is included but we have not heard any word
from her yet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#14:1>
Hope you can come home for the grand reunion in February 2001. </p>

Subject: ALEX IS RETIRING

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#19:2>
Dear Batchmates,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#20:2>
MAJGEN Alex Costales is inviting all USTHS Batch 61 ( Morning and
Afternoon Sessions) to attend the Testimonial Parade in his honor on Friday,
15th Dec 2000, at 4:00 PM, the Parade Grounds Grandstand of Fort Bonifacio,
Makati.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#21:2>
He is retiring this December 21st ( his birthday) as Vice Commander
of the Phil Army after serving for 32 years.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#22:2>
This is Alex 's &ldquo; LAST HURRAH".

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#23:2>
He will reserve a special section of the grandstand for us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#24:2>
After the parade, there will be cocktails at the La Bodega
Restaurant ( opposite the Parade Grounds) for his guests and the big shots of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#25:2>
After the cocktails, we will hold our USTHS ' 61 Christmas Party ( in
another function room but in the same building).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#26:2>
We will either split the damage or just bring whatever you can,
booze, <indig> pulutan </indig> , <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#27:2>
<indig> Bahala na kayo. </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#28:2>
Alex has invited all those present during the Dec 7 Batch ' 61
Meeting at Boy Perlas ' Penthouse and has requested me to extend the
invitation to all through our egroups. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#29:2>

Subject: Reunion with Edwina and Rosalie

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#34:3>
Dear All,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#35:3>
The Batch had a wonderful time during this reunion - batchmates
seeing each other after 40 long years!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#36:3>
Some had to look at the <foreign> Veritas </foreign> <&> = high
school yearbook </&> ( I brought my copy) to see how he/she looked like 40
years ago and that was when one would say, <quote> &ldquo; Oh I knew you then
but I would not have recognized you if I met you someplace! &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#37:3>
While, some would say, <quote> &ldquo; Oh <indig> hindi ka nagbago,
tumanda / tumaba ka lang </indig> but you look the same! &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#38:3>
We had a very good attendance - thanks to the 2 <indig>
balikbayans </indig> <&> =returnees to the country </&> Rosalie and Edwina D.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#39:3>
1) Many told Rosalie that they remember her being <foreign>
morena </foreign> in contrast to her <foreign> mestiza </foreign> complexion
now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#40:3>
2) The two busy bankers ( Agnes and Perla) finally made it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#41:3>
3) Our Naic Mayor Edwina was able to get away from her busy
schedule and came for the first time ( after my numerous calls and faxes -
<indig> nakulitan na sa akin! </indig> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#42:3>
4) Newly found Rosalinda Tagle-Capino and Aurora Perello-Tavera
were surprised to see so many un/familiar faces.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#43:3>
Rosalinda Tagle didn't recognize me but I had the advantage of
knowing beforehand that she was coming.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#44:3>
Aurora Perello and I could not really recall knowing each other
before - besides, I couldn't find her in the <indig> Veritas </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#45:3>
- Later on did we discover that we really never met in high school
cuz she was there 1st and 2nd year while I was there 3rd and 4th year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#46:3>
5) Doris Erestain-Reytas who is now the President of Ernie 's
company but still connected to the Civil Service Commission was also present.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#47:3>
6) Regular attendees Myrna Bilan, Evelyn Valencia, Raquel Rey,
Aida and Ed dela Rosa, Jun P., Alex C., Jack Jacinto, Bert Llamas, Boy
Perlas, Justin Coquia, Cesar Preclaro, Danny and I were all present. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#48:3>
7) We would not have had Edwina Dayao 's presence if not for the
ingenious mind of Jun Pascual.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#49:3>
Edwina had to attend a relative 's wedding ( her reason for coming
home) on that same day but Jun came up with the idea of fetching Edwina from
the reception ( about 9-9:30 pm) and catch up with our group...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#50:3>
Pandemonium broke out when she arrived!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#51:3>
She 's still the same lively Edwina. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#52:3>
[ I don't think it is a good idea for most of us to see each
other for the first time after 40 years in Manila Hotel already!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#53:3>
<indig> ( Hindi tayo makakasigaw!) </indig> ] </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#54:3>
No formal meeting could be started because of the excitement of
everybody but at least Evelyn was able to collect some payments for the
tickets and the guys had a short meeting on finances before adjourning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#55:3>
After the dinner, Edwina, Rosalie, Aida, Ed, Jun, Alex, Danny and
I hopped to Mandarin Hotel for some music, then to Whistle Stop for some
<foreign> congee </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#56:3>
<indig> Inumaga na kami sa daan. </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#57:3>
That 's all folks.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#58:3>
You can now imagine how it will be at Manila Hotel! </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#59:3>
Miroan

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#60:3>
P.S. Rosalie, I received your text from Milan ( ? ) and was
trying to text back but couldn't get thru by just &ldquo; replying".

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#61:3>
I didn't have the country code that time cuz I was out of the house
then.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#62:3>
You are very welcome and we hope you can make it back on the 24th!
</p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#65:4>
Belated Happy Mothers ' Day to all the mothers in our batch!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#66:4>
( Am using again my daughter 's computer as mine went back to the
supplier!) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#67:4>
Rosalie, thanks for the photos you sent thru registered mail (
although I had difficulty getting it since I don't have a valid &ldquo;
Miroan Sy &rdquo; ID; only a &ldquo; Michaela Sy &rdquo; ID/credit cards/SSS/
<foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#68:4>
I showed my business card which had &ldquo; Michaela ` Miroan` S. Sy
&rdquo; printed on it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#69:4>
I had to explain how MIROAN came from MIchaela ROsalia ANastacia
which appeared in my baptismal certificate which I brought along too,
together with our USTHS Directory showing &ldquo; Miroan &rdquo; as the
nickname for Michaela Sy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#70:4>
<indig> Haaayyy </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#71:4>
Rosalie, it was fun though and I am mentioning this to the whole
batch just to let you all know that in case you need to send any docs or
photos, you can now send it either to Michaela Sy or Miroan Sy since I
already have the docs to prove that these two names are one and the same.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#72:4>
Heh heh heh! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#73:4>
I brought these pictures ( taken when you and Edwina came home)
during Ed 's birthday and gave copies to Jun, Jack, Doris, Raquel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#74:4>
I plan to give Edwina Poblete-Mendoza and Evelyn R-V when I see them
next.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#75:4>
Thanks again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#76:4>
Vilma, I gave one copy of the black and white Newsletter to Alex.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#77:4>
I still have one copy - probably to Vic Z when I see him(?). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#78:4>
Linda, I gave one copy of the <mention> Aquinian </mention> to
Anna Poco for the USTHS AA file and have promised Ms. Eden Tolentino the
other copy to be handed to the Principal for their library.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#79:4>
My going to UST was delayed by EDSA III and the other developments
that followed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#80:4>
Hopefully by next week, I 'll be able to go. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#81:4>
Denny, Jun P. has been designated by the group in charge of the
Computer shipment.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#82:4>
Ed and Jun, I understand, have been communicating with you
separately.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#83:4>
And Jun said he assigned Vic Feliciano to be in charge of customs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#84:4>
Has Evelyn responded to your docs requirements ( names of authorized
recipient)?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#85:4>
Is there anything you need from me? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#86:4>
Las Vegas is A-okay with me and Danny.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#87:4>
Bus tour to places okay also as long as it 's not too long.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#88:4>
As Ben T. said, it 's difficult for us at our age, to be sitting for
a long time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#89:4>
Definitely no long walks for Danny cuz of his legs ( embolism?).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#90:4>
Altho we have been to Yosemite Park and Bryce Canyon, we can tag
along again if that 's one choice of the whole group.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#91:4>
We 'd also love to go to Hawaii.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#92:4>
All these in a week 's time, right?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#93:4>
Can't afford longer than a week cuz we 'd need one week with Danny 's
sister at WestHills ( Canoga Park) and another week or two in NY with our son
( & Ohio probably). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#94:4>
Regards to all. </p>

Subject: I 'm back but Sorry!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#98:5>
Dear Batchmates,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#99:5>
I 've been back in the Phil since May 21 but had to wait until my
computer got fixed before I could send you messages.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#100:5>
Sorry! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#101:5>
To Vilma and the Bay Areans: sorry for not having made it last
May 18.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#102:5>
I know I missed so much - that was supposed to be my chance to
experience first hand one of Vilma 's exotic, colorful, sumptuous, out of
this world parties.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#103:5>
Plus a chance to be with batchmates again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#104:5>
I hope you received the Wedding Anniversary card I sent you and Eric
plus photos with Evic and Ellen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#105:5>
To Pura: thanks for your offer for us to stay in your place.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#106:5>
To Linda and Helen: I missed bonding with you during the 10-hour
drive to and from Castro Valley.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#107:5>
Sorry you got lost looking for my place in WestHills on your return
from SF.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#108:5>
Apparently, someone in his senior moment forgot to give you the
corrected direction... ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#109:5>
To Mon Llenado, <indig> sayang </indig> , I was looking forward
to meeting you again after more than 30 years!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#110:5>
I missed your breakfast.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#111:5>
Somebody, please ask for Mon 's email address so I can include him
in our chem egroup if he 's not yet a member. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#112:5>
To other batchmates who didn't get to attend the Las Vegas
reunion, I missed meeting you after so many years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#113:5>
Looking forward to seeing you again in 2003 and in 2004! </p>

P.S. To Art ( Pineda): thanks for the two photos you sent me and
Danny thru email.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#117:5>
Sorry for not responding sooner.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#118:5>
The photos looked good!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#119:5>
Are there some more coming?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#124:6>
Hi, batchmates! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#125:6>
Happy 2nd Anniversary to our usths61@yahoogroups. com.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#126:6>
Thanks for staying in the loop! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#127:6>
We started out with about 15 members ( courtesy of Noah!) last
June 28, 2000.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#128:6>
Before the end of the year, our group expanded to a total of 34.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#129:6>
In 2001, we were able to include 15 more batchmates and in 2002,
just about 8; but I hope that before the year ends, we 'll find more
batchmates.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#130:6>
These figures are just approx since members have been in and out of
this group, changing their email addresses and/or subscribing and
unsubscribing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#131:6>
A total of 57 batchmates are now included in the egroup, out of
a total of 108 traced batchmates.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#132:6>
So, please call those whom you are in contact with and ask for their
email addresses so that it will be easier for all of us to communicate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#133:6>
As a result of this egroup ( now yahoogroup), we have had so many
successful mini, maxi, grand, whatever-you-may-want-to-call-it reunions,
whether it is ballroom dancing, picnic, <indig> tomahan </indig> , or just
being in a group of ( <foreign> dos palmas </foreign> ) survivors, or just
plain <indig> chikahan </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#134:6>
We have found various reasons to be together - during the annual
USTHS Grand Reunion, when there 's a <indig> balikbayan </indig> in town,
during birthdays, tours, and unfortunately ( 2) deaths for the past 2 years.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#135:6>
And we will find more reasons to get together esp when most of us
have retired.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#136:6>
Don't you think so too? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#137:6>
As for our Batch Directory, I 'm still in the process of
updating it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#138:6>
Those who have not provided me with their home and business
addresses, home and business contact numbers and email addresses, pls send it
to miroansy@info.com.ph.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-014#139:6>
I will email it as soon as I 'm done. </p>
