<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#1:1:A>
Dr Villacorta Mr del Rosario thank you for the rare fortune of having been introduced two times <O> laughter </O> and therefore exposed to the hazards of double jeopardy <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#3:1:A>
Let me place those two introductions in proper perspective <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#4:1:A>
The truth of the matter is that I was such a lousy student I decided to be a professor no reflection on professors who may be present here today <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#5:1:A>
And after having taught law for almost thirteen years <,,> I decided I was such a lousy professor I had better be a dean <O> laughter </O> no reflection on deans who may be present here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#8:1:A>
And after four years as a dean of law I decided I was such a lousy dean I had better run for Congress <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#9:1:A>
And indeed <,> I became Congressman representing the second district of Rizal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#10:1:A>
But after four years I decided I was such a lousy Congressman and so ran for the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#12:1:A>
Now this is my third term as Senator of the Philippines and I 'm beginning to toy with the idea <O> laughter and clapping </O> that perhaps I 'm such a lousy Senator I had better run for the Presidency if I were qualified for it for the Presidency of the Rizal High School Alumni Association <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#14:1:A>
<indig> Akala ninyo kung ano ang sasabihin ko </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#15:1:A>
In any event <,> Mr President Pedro Mora of <foreign> Ley </foreign> La Salle and the other presidents who are here in our midst my dear fellow students I am sure that everyone is aching to know about the latest developments in the Liberal Party which culminated in one <,> the resignation of my dear friend Erap Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#17:1:A>
Two the unanimous acceptance of that resignation by the executive committee of the Liberal Party
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#18:1:A>
And three the nomination by the executive committee through the consistory method of voting of two candidates for President and two candidates for Vice-President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#19:1:A>
Actually this is the first step <?> chosen </?> by the Liberal Party in order to eliminate the practice of bribery and vote buying the curse and at once the evil of the old system of politics in this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#21:1:A>
There are therefore three steps in choosing the L P candidate for President and Vice-President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#22:1:A>
The first step is at the level of the thirty-five-man executive committee which met last March eight at the residence of former President Diosdado Macapagal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#23:1:A>
The first two names with the highest votes for President and Vice-President are then forwarded to the national directorate composed of six hundred party leaders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#24:1:A>
The directorate which will meet in June or July will either ratify or reject the said nominations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#25:1:A>
And the third step will be when the national convention composed of around four thousand leaders of the Liberal Party throughout the country meets on or around December twenty-nine nineteen ninety-one and renders the final verdict on who shall be the Liberal Party candidate for President and the Liberal candidate for Vice-President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#26:1:A>
Last March eight <,> that is to say the other Friday when the executive committee was holding its consistory a method which I shall explain very shortly my friend Erap reportedly charged that I was a dictator and that I wanted to control the entire selection process by handpicking the thirty-five members of the executive committee
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#27:1:A>
You might recall that after his resignation and this was featured on television that same evening and in the newspapers the next morning I said I wish Senator Erap Estrada well and that I do not <.> wi </.> wish to speak ill of him 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#28:1:A>
The reason for that statement is that in truth Erap was misinformed or ill-advised which is why only last week he denied that he had called me a dictator and offered apologies to me through the mass media
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#29:1:A>
In any case allow me to say something that is a matter of record
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#30:1:A>
I was imprisoned twice because I was against absolute rule I was against dictatorship
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#31:1:A>
First during the Japanese occupation when as a young man of twenty <indig> sabagay bata pa rin ako hanggang ngayon <indig> <O> laughter </O> when as a young man of twenty I joined the underground
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#33:1:A>
I was the editor of the guerilla paper in the province of Rizal <,> was captured by the <foreign> Kempetai </foreign> the Japanese Military Police severely tortured in the presence of my father
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#34:1:A>
I thought then that my father must have suffered a thousand sufferings he must have died a thousand deaths
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#36:1:A>
And then I was transferred to Fort Santiago and you will find the plaque there later sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor <indig> kaya't hindi po lamang ako senador presidente ng senado </indig> ex-convict <indig> po rin ako sapagkat nagsilbi po rin ako sa </indig> Muntinlupa
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#37:1:A>
And of course during the Marcos years after the release of Ninoy Aquino in May nineteen eighty <indig> ako na abogado ni Ninoy ako naman ang pinaaresto ni Marcos at inihalili doon sa kulungan ni Ninoy doon sa Fort Bonifacio </indig> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#38:1:A>
It would therefore be a little strange <indig> bago ko makalimutan mabuti sabihin ko sa inyo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#39:1:A>
Before <,> I was released by Marcos <,> there was tremendous pressure brought to bear on him from within and from without
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#40:1:A>
Marcos must have been surprised that he received telegrams even from Poland which was then under communism
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#41:1:A>
Actually a fellow worker of mine in the World Council of Churches sent him a telegram urging my release
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#42:1:A>
I was released before the end of nineteen eighty-eight <indig> ngunit ang pagkakasalita ni Marcos doon sa kanyang </indig> directive <indig> ay napakaganda </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#44:1:A>
He said I am hereby releasing Salonga from military custody and placing him under house arrest under the custody of his wife Mrs Lydia Salonga <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#45:1:A>
When I got home that night I was debating in my mind as to which was better <O> laughter </O> military custody or marital custody <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#47:1:A>
In fact when I got home I saw on my desk a note from my <indig> pamangkin </indig> for whom many of you might have voted during the last election 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#> Rene Saguisag sent me a letter saying Dear Uncle I pity you on top of martial law you are now under marital law <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#48:1:A>
And I sent a quick note to him I said Dear Nephew do not pity me 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#50:1:A>
Long before the imposition of martial law I had always been under marital law <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#51:1:A>
<indig> Ang hirap paniwalang-paniwala naman doon ang misis ko </indig> so I have to reassure audiences that I 'm still the commander-in-chief at home <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#52:1:A>
And that my last words every time I got out of home are of course yes I agree darling <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#53:1:A>
Anyway let 's go back <indig> baka madiskaril tayo </indig> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#54:1:A>
What I 'm trying to say is that it 's a little strange that I who fought dictatorships and risked my whole life should act like a dictator
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#55:1:A>
Anyway let us review the latest developments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#56:1:A>
Toward the end of nineteen ninety last year Erap Estrada and Tito Guingona our majority floor leader in the Senate approached me separately and told me about their understanding to entrust to me as probable Presidential nominee the prerogative of selecting my Vice-Presidential teammate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#57:1:A>
Note that this is the usual practice in democracies like the United States and the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#58:1:A>
In the Philippines you will recall Ramon Magsaysay chose Carlos P Garcia as his running mate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#59:1:A>
Macapagal chose Emmanuel Pelaez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#60:1:A>
President Marcos chose Fernando Lopez
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#61:1:A>
In the United States John Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#62:1:A>
Reagan chose George Bush
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#63:1:A>
And George Bush chose Dan Quayle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#64:1:A>
So there is nothing dictatorial in that kind of a practice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#65:1:A>
But I was not comfortable with the idea for one simple reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#66:1:A>
Both Erap and Tito are very close to me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#67:1:A>
I am the <indig> ninong </indig> in marriage of Erap 's son Jinggoy the vice-mayor of San Juan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#68:1:A>
And I am also the <indig> ninong </indig> in marriage of Tito Guingona 's son 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#> Hence I felt I should select the Vice-Presidential nominee only after consultation with the executive committee of the Liberal Party
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#69:1:A>
The assertion of my friend Erap that it is undemocratic for me to choose my running mate is therefore historically wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#70:1:A>
And more than that it is repudiated by his own press statements
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#71:1:A>
I will just cite one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#72:1:A>
In the Philippine Inquirer issue of February twenty-three nineteen ninety-one Erap was quoted by Senate reporter Jenny Ilio in the following words Yes said Erap I 'm willing to forego my Presidential ambition if Senate President Salonga will get me as his Vice-Presidential teammate 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#73:1:A>
Otherwise Erap said I will leave the Liberal Party quote unquote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#74:1:A>
In other words what my friend Erap had wanted me to do that is choose him over <.> Ti </.> Tito Guingona as my teammate is precisely the very same thing he now considers undemocratic or dictatorial and which we in the Liberal Party did not follow anyway
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#75:1:A>
At any rate on January eight nineteen ninety-one I invited Erap and Tito to my residence as I was bothered by the fact that their version of their understanding differed in some respects
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#77:1:A>
For example Tito told me that they had agreed that whoever lost in the selection would be the campaign manager of the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#78:1:A>
Erap denied this to me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#79:1:A>
Hence I prepared the draft of an agreement embodying their idea of vesting in me as Presidential nominee the prerogative of selecting my running mate in accordance with the election law and the Liberal Party practice but giving me enough latitude to consult the executive committee of the party
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#80:1:A>
What Erap did not like in that written agreement was the last paragraph
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#81:1:A>
It said we solemnly promise to abide by the decision and work unconditionally for the victory of the Liberal Party 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#82:1:A>
It was this paragraph that he did not like
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#83:1:A>
Erap told me if you decide in favor of Tito this means <indig> wala na akong pupuntahan </indig> I have no more option 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#85:1:A>
In fairness to Tito however he was prepared to sign that document
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#86:1:A>
Erap brought that document with him and eventually showed it to some people who leaked it to the press with their very critical comments <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#87:1:A>
<indig> Dito pala may </indig> partial brownout <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#88:1:A>
<indig> Pagka ang pinag-uusapan pala ay si Erap nagkakaroon ng </indig> brownout <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#89:1:A>
<indig> Parang may </indig> shooting <indig> tayong palagi dito </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#90:1:A>
As a result the L P Executive Committee which met several times <,,> formulated what is now known as the three step process and adopted all the proposals of Senators Maceda and Estrada in the selection of our candidates <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#92:1:A>
Although Erap has already apologized to me let me clarify the baselessness of his charge that I handpicked the members of the executive committee
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#93:1:A>
Under the party constitution the great majority of the members of the executive committee are the national officials elected by the people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#94:1:A>
The former President of the Philippines Diosdado Macapagal is the titular head
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#95:1:A>
All the eight L P senators <,> and all the nineteen members of Congress compose the majority of the executive committee members
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#96:1:A>
They are not there because Salonga handpicked them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#97:1:A>
They are there because they were elected by the people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#98:1:A>
Eminent <?> legal </?> personalities such as former Justice Cecilia Mu&ntilde;oz-Palma President of the Con Com of which Vice-President Villacorta is a shining star <O> laughter </O> <indig> patay sila dun </indig> <O> laughter </O> and Chief Justice Pedro Yap who was abroad at the time of the meeting are in the executive committee because the L P constitution so provides
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#101:1:A>
These are distinguished men and women known for their independent-mindedness their integrity and their competence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#102:1:A>
How can I possibly dictate to them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#103:1:A>
<indig> Marahil at ito'y sinabi ko kay Erap hindi lamang nabasa ng mga </indig> advisers <indig> mo ang </indig> party constitution <indig> at ang </indig> party rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#104:1:A>
<indig> Hindi mo kasalanan 'yan ang sabi ko kay Erap 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#105:1:A>
'Yan ay kasalanan ng mga tagapayo mo na hindi marunong magbasa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#106:1:A>
Now this brings me to the consistory or concrete method of voting which was followed last March eight at the meeting of the executive committee in the house of President Macapagal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#107:1:A>
Incidentally <,> this is the method used by the Cardinals when they choose the Pope <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#108:1:A>
In the March eight meeting of the executive committee presided by President Macapagal there were no nominations <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#109:1:A>
Everyone belonging to the party was a potential candidate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#110:1:A>
There were no speeches
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#111:1:A>
The balloting was secret and there was no vote buying
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#112:1:A>
Money politics under the new politics of the Liberal Party was completely eliminated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#113:1:A>
Before the balloting began at around nine in the morning we received a letter of resignation from Erap Estrada handcarried by Congressman Rivera of Bulacan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#114:1:A>
The letter stated that due to quote recent developments within the party unquote he arrived at the painful decision quote unquote to render his resignation effective immediately
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#115:1:A>
This caught the executive committee by surprise
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#116:1:A>
A week ago on February twenty-six and a day before the meeting of the executive committee Erap had reassured our congressmen that he was coming to the executive committee meeting he was going to participate in the voting and he would abide by the results
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#117:1:A>
Therefore <,> that time and again Erap had threatened to bolt the Liberal Party if I did not choose him as Vice-Presidential teammate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-021#118:1:A>
In one breath he wanted me to exercise one-man rule but in the next breath he condemned the practice he had wanted as dictatorial or undemocratic
