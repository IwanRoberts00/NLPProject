<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#5:1>
Dear Ms. Garcia:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#6:1>
I would like to request that the Library order a copy of the book
<it> The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language </it> ( Rodney Huddleston
and Geoffrey Pullum).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#7:1>
The book can be used as a textbook in our graduate courses such as
<it> Grammatical Structure of English </it> and <it> Current Syntactic Theory
</it> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#8:1>
You may place your order through Academic Book Sales ( see attached
order form). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#9:1>
Further, I wonder if you could subscribe to a new publication,
<it> Journal of English for Academic Purposes </it> ( JEAP) ( Elsevier
Science), a sister to <it> English for Specific Purposes </it> , to which the
university has been a subscriber for several years now.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#10:1>
I understand that the first issue of JEAP will be coming out any time
this year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#11:1>
The journal will be useful in light of our decision to reactivate
English for Specific Purposes as one of the tracks of the M. A. in English
Language Education program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#12:1>
Your favorable action on the matter will be highly appreciated.
</p>

Dear Bro. Andrew:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#20:2>
Thanks for your letter dated 12 January 2002 requesting that the
proposed studies of REV. BYUNG-HOON LEE on the Bontoc language be credited
towards a Ph.D. in Applied Linguistics.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#21:2>
After consulting with senior faculty members of the department, I
would like to inform you that we are willing to credit Rev. Lee 's work as
coursework because of the potential contribution of the studies to
scholarship in Philippine languages.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#22:2>
However, we would like to request Rev. Lee to write up one of his
studies ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> discourse analysis) to serve as his
dissertation under your supervision. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#23:2>
I shall appreciate any information on the progress of the
research during the five-year period. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#24:2>

TO: ELED Faculty

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#32:3>
FROM: DT Dayag

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#33:3>
SUBJECT: Proposal to Change Department 's Name

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#34:3>
At the ELED fulltimers ' meeting held 26 November, I proposed
that the name of the department be changed to one that will be reflective of
the thrust and research agenda of the department and that will erase the
confusion arising from the use by the Educational Leadership Department of
the acronym ELD, which we had adopted for many years before we decided in
1999 to merge with the College of Education.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#35:3>
While those in attendance at the meeting unanimously approved the
proposal, the body failed to agree on the proposed new name <mention>
Department of English and Applied Linguistics ( DEAL) </mention> since there
were a number of key issues raised in connection with it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#36:3>
The first issue had to do with the observation that all departments
under the College of Education need to include in their nomenclature the word
<mention> &ldquo; education &rdquo; </mention> to reflect their affiliation
with the CED.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#37:3>
The second was that a department that would go by the name <mention>
&ldquo; Department of English and Applied Linguistics &rdquo; </mention>
might send the signal that it is allied with the humanities and that it
belongs to the College of Liberal Arts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#38:3>
Yesterday, I met with Dr. Allan B. I. Bernardo, CED Dean, to talk
about the proposal and the above issues raised at the fulltimers ' meeting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#39:3>
He said we could go ahead with <mention> &ldquo; DEAL &rdquo;
</mention> since the more relevant issue here is the identity of the
department rather than its affiliation with a college. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#40:3>
But why Department of English and Applied Linguistics ( DEAL)?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#41:3>
Aside from the factor of easy name recall, the proposed name has the
advantage of reflecting our distinct identity as an English department, but
at the same time, it mirrors the expansion of the vision and research agenda
of the department resulting from our merger in 1999 with the CED and the
corresponding transfer to the department of the M.A. and Ph.D. programs
offered by the defunct Language Education Department.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#42:3>
In addition, the use of <mention> &ldquo; applied linguistics &rdquo;
</mention> is justified if we look at the field in a broader sense to include
not only language teaching but the hyphenated subfields of linguistics,
<foreign> e.g. </foreign> sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#43:3>
Having said that, I would like to get your consensus on the
matter before I present it at the CED Council of Chairs meeting on December
5.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#44:3>
Could you therefore fill out the slip below and return it to Nilda
ASAP? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#45:3>
Thank you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#46:3>
Direction: Please tick off your preference. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#47:3>
_____ I am in favor of changing ELED 's name to Department of English
and Applied Linguistics ( DEAL).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#48:3>
_____ I am not in favor of changing ELED 's name to DEAL.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#49:3>
I would like to propose this name instead:

Further, I would like to request that a mechanism ( <foreign>

the usual screening processes that they will go through ( <foreign> e.g.
</foreign> admissions exam).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#59:4>
This is to ensure that we get the best and the brightest among the

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#94:7>
I am very pleased to inform you that your student CHEVY ERALI
CONTRERAS ( third year BSC-Marketing) has been chosen by the English Language
Education Department as the official representative of the university and of
the country to the Digital Campus Consortium ( DCC) International Student
Symposium to be held on December 5, 6, and 7, 2001, at Waseda University,
Tokyo, Japan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#95:7>
This symposium is an offshoot of the ongoing Cross-Cultural Distance
Learning, an online chat project involving students of DLSU-Manila and of
Waseda University, that began sometime in 1999.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#96:7>
It is a gathering of student-representatives from Asia and the
Pacific who are taking part in the project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#97:7>
Aware of the importance of the symposium to the university and to
the country, I would like to request that Ms. Contreras be excused from all
her classes on the above-mentioned dates.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#98:7>
I would also appreciate it if you could allow her to attend to her
visa application at the Japanese embassy on November 22, without having to be
marked absent on that day. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#99:7>
Your favorable action on the matter will be highly appreciated.

FROM: DT Dayag

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#103:8>
SUBJECT: <h> PAASCU Reaccreditation Visit </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#104:8>
In connection with the PAASCU Reaccreditation visit scheduled
for December 3-4, I would like to remind you about the following matters
related to the area of Classroom Instruction:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#105:8>
1. Avoid getting absent from or being late for your class on
December 3-4. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#106:8>
2. NO early dismissal; NO substitution; NO transfer of rooms.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#107:8>
On the latter, Oralcomm teachers have to make sure that performances
will be held in the original classroom assigned to the class.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#108:8>
The Vice Chair will not entertain any request for change of rooms on
the two PAASCU days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#109:8>
3. Reserve a seat near the door of your classroom for PAASCU
accreditor and have a copy of your course syllabus ready.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#110:8>
I will appreciate it if you can highlight in your syllabus the
lesson/activity or activities scheduled for the day, or better still, if you
can come up with an abbreviated lesson plan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#111:8>
If you opt for the second, you may want to write it on the board or
prepare a clean hard copy ( placed in a folder) for the accreditor 's
consumption. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#112:8>
4. As I have said time and again, ELED faculty should be
exemplars of good English.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#113:8>
This means that our utterances in class are in straight, accurate
and appropriate English.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#114:8>
And that rules out the use of Filipino or Taglish ( code-switching)
in the English class.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#115:8>
As I mentioned in my 1998 memorandum on the ELED language policy,
even Tagalog speech fillers and tags such as <indig> di ba </indig> , <indig>
parang </indig> , <indig> ano </indig> , <indig> bale </indig> , and the
like, interspersed with English utterances, do not have a place in an English
class.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#116:8>
We should also make an effort to remind our students about the need
to speak in straight English when they are in the English class. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#117:8>
5. Apart from mastery and organization of subject matter and
classroom management, PAASCU accreditors will take a very close look at the
following characteristics of effective instruction: ( a) Ability to answer
questions, ( b) Openness to students ' opinions, ( c) Ability to provoke
critical and analytic thinking, ( d) Ability to motivate, ( e) Question
technique, ( f) Use of teaching aids, and ( g) Class participation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#118:8>
In connection with ( f), if you will have to use OHP transparencies,
make sure that these are good reproductions of your lecture notes, NOT poor
copies of pages of a book.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#119:8>
In addition, they should NOT be text-based, <foreign> i.e.
</foreign> the text should be accompanied by some graphics.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#120:8>
On ( g), please keep in mind that in an English class, there should
be more STUDENT TALK than TEACHER TALK.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#121:8>
To carry this injunction out, I would like to suggest that you
reserve for the two PAASCU days your &ldquo; best &rdquo; activity, <foreign>
i.e. </foreign> one that will ensure maximum class participation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#122:8>
6. Lastly, you will all agree with me that teaching is a
performance.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#123:8>
May I therefore call on all of you to put your best foot forward in
those two days as our way of supporting the Administration in its effort
towards achieving Level III accreditation for the College of Education. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#124:8>
Thanks for all the support and cooperation. </p>

Dear Dr. Monta&ntilde;ano:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#131:9>
I would like to request that the implementation of my project
entitled <it> Language of Persuasion in Four Discourse Types: Television
Advertising, Newspaper Editorials, Print Advertising, and Religious Sermons
</it> be moved from the current term to the first trimester, school year 2002
- 2003.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#132:9>
This stems from the fact that I have been invited to contribute an
article on <it> The English-Language Media in the Philippines </it> to the
special issue of the international journal <it> World Englishes </it> on
Philippine English.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#133:9>
Before writing this article, I need to do rigorous data-gathering
and analysis.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#134:9>
I, together with the other contributors, am given until February
2002 to complete a draft of the paper.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#135:9>
Given the tremendous responsibilities of an ELED Department
Chairperson, it is physically and mentally impossible to conduct two research
projects and write up on them simultaneously, hence this request. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-022#136:9>
I look forward to hearing from you very soon. </p>
