<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#1:1:A>
Thank you Mr Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#2:1:A>
Mr Chief Justice I 'll be very very brief
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#3:1:A>
I uh feel when I 'm standing in this chamber this evening that uh I 'm
actually facing the bar of history and the bar of public opinion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#4:1:A>
There is a certain amount of <.> tre </.> trepidation in my heart
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#5:1:A>
But nonetheless I must perform my duty <,> as I must being a member
of this chamber
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#6:1:A>
Mr President uh Mr uh Chief Justice I 'm not saying at this point
that President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is guilty of the charges against him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#7:1:A>
Neither am I saying that he is innocent not yet
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#8:1:A>
What I 'm saying at this point and this is the only issue before us
is that I cannot <,> as a judge perform the function of the House of
Representatives which has the sole power authority and <.> perer </.> 
prerogative to prepare the articles that will impeach <,> and impeach the
President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#9:1:A>
If indeed the President of the Philippines committed the alleged
wrongdoings being imputed to him on the basis of the facts claimed to have
been uncovered by the prosecution after the articles of impeachment have been
elevated to the Senate then let the House of Representatives perform its
constitutional duty to prepare a new set of article or articles of
impeachment to embody the newly discovered acts of alleged wrongdoing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#10:1:A>
To do otherwise Mr uh Chief Justice and ladies and gentlemen of the
Senate I humbly submit that this Senate acting as an impeachment court has no
power under the Constitution to amend the articles of impeachment before us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#11:1:A>
It cannot constitutionally and validly perform the task lodged
solely by the Constitution on the House of Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#12:1:A>
To do that to do so would be a total travesty of due process and a
transgression of elementary fairness
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#13:1:A>
You know Mr uh Chief Justice ladies and gentlemen of this chamber
we talk of discovering the truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#14:1:A>
There are people in this chamber who do not know the meaning of
truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#15:1:A>
One time and I 'll tell you this I was charged with a crime that
was not even in our statute books rebellion complex with murder
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#16:1:A>
And my witness to the fact that I was innocent and even the
distinguished member of the Senate Senator Cayetano knows about this and some
gentlemen in this chamber know about this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#17:1:A>
My witness was no less than a priest who was saying Mass in my
House at that very moment when they say that Senator Gringo Honasan then
Colonel Honasan was in my House with one hundred soldiers at that precise
moment for which I was framed and jailed with rebellion complex with murder
in order to immobilize me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#18:1:A>
And you know what happened to Father Danilo Dagsan the priest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#19:1:A>
He was shipped out of this country by no less than Jaime Cardinal
Sin with the connivance and conspiracy of President Corazon Aquino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#20:1:A>
And this is the opportune time Mr President Mr Chief Justice for me
to put this in the annals and record of this Republic so that future
historians will know the entire truth about this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#21:1:A>
Thank you </I> 


 <I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#22:2:A>
Uh thank you Mr Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#23:2:A>
The whole country or maybe perhaps even Filipinos in other
countries are listening to us right now and I wonder how many of them think
listening to our colleagues that they are listening to a political rally or
they are listening to a legal proceeding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#24:2:A>
Because the nature Mr Chief Justice and my dear colleagues of what
has been going on in this chamber for the last month and a half has really
been a <,> an event uh which has in effect been an arena on two sides
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#25:2:A>
On the one hand you have the political arena and Amado Doronila
correctly observed in a recent column of the Philippine Daily Inquirer that
those who are opposed to the continued tenure of President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada are winning the public opinion battle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#26:2:A>
A very shall we say candid remark
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#27:2:A>
Because he in effect is saying that what is going on is not really
a trial for the impeachment of the President of the Philippines but rather an
effort to bring down that President not by the constitutional processes that
we are actively engaged in but through the bar of public opinion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#28:2:A>
And that perhaps Mr President explains why many times in this court
there are statements by the prosecution that uh it is making a pro offer it
is announcing something that it will do to subpoena the records of Citibank
because the President his wife the ladies that he is <.> so </.> said to be
uh associated with as well as his so-called cronies have accounts in the
Citibank and immediately the next day almost all the newspapers are
headlining President Estrada Mrs <.> Eje </.> Loi Ejercito Estrada <foreign> 
etcetera etcetera </foreign> have accounts in Citibank as if this was gospel
truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#29:2:A>
This is of course the arena of public opinion that is being fed by
unsubstantiated loose remarks coming from the prosecution within this chamber
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#30:2:A>
We are therefore being used Mr President we are being used
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#31:2:A>
We are being made puppets in a show to bring about the completion
the success of an agenda that is not provided for in the Constitution and
that is what really is the unfortunate thing of what is going on Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#32:2:A>
Now Mr President in this whole effort members of the Senate are
attacked by the prosecution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#33:2:A>
There is a scoreboard there right across our very parking lot which
ridicules us and of course those who are perceived to be not following the
dictates of the mob
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#34:2:A>
And Mr President we ourselves have turned upon each other and even
in the lounge where we have our <foreign> meriendas </foreign> you will not
you need not be perceptive to see how the groupings of the senators sitting
with each other no longer show the old environment of cordiality that was
present here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#35:2:A>
<indig> Nagkakampo-kampo na tayo dun sa </indig> dining room
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#36:2:A>
Those are the those are the the uh shall we say the heavy burden
that we have to bear as the result of what is going on and uh I bewail this
because it is unnecessary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#37:2:A>
And it would have been totally different if there had been no
 <unclear> 1 word </unclear> T V cameras in this hall it would have been
totally different
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#38:2:A>
And this is the result of all these cameras all over cameras
peeking on our feet cameras trying to catch us asleep cameras trying to catch
us talking to each other as if we were supposed to sit here like stupefied
mummies listening to everything that is going on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#39:2:A>
And so Mr President tonight we are here voting on a very simple
question
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#40:2:A>
I mean this is a question that a judge in the lower in the Regional
Trial Court rules on every day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#41:2:A>
This is a question that justices of the Court of Appeals rule on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#42:2:A>
The rules are very simple
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#43:2:A>
The rules are very clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#44:2:A>
The facts are very clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#45:2:A>
But because there is T V around this has become a big spectacle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#46:2:A>
Mr President I would like to say that our vote tonight even if some
of us feel that they are casting their vote on the final judgment is not
really a vote on a final judgment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#47:2:A>
And the final judgment may or may not follow the result of the
voting tonight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#48:2:A>
And if there are those I think it would be appropriate to say who
want to make a big issue out of this for their own purposes so be it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#49:2:A>
For me Mr President Mr Chief Justice this is just a simple vote on
a simple procedural issue that is well <.> lie </.> uh which is well-defined
provided for in the rules of evidence and all the rules that we have been
following
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#50:2:A>
So in conclusion may I say Mr President and Mr Chief Justice what
is this fuss all about
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#51:2:A>
Thank you </I> 


 <I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#52:3:A>
Mr Chief Justice my colleagues
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#53:3:A>
It is quite unfortunate that my good friend Senator Juan Ponce
Enrile brought up the issue again an incident of history that happened ten
years ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#54:3:A>
I will not deal at length on that point
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#55:3:A>
I would rather just let history and our people decide on the action
of the players at that time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#56:3:A>
But let me just state that in nineteen ninety I was placed in a
situation where I had to defend the existence of a duly-constituted
government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#57:3:A>
And therefore I invoked the law and the legal processes in order to
protect the duly constituted government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#58:3:A>
I did not take extra-legal measures
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#59:3:A>
I invoked a decision or the dissenting opinion in a case decided by
the Supreme Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#60:3:A>
We followed the law
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#61:3:A>
We followed the Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#62:3:A>
Let the people judge our action in history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#63:3:A>
But having said that Mr President Mr Chief Justice let <.> m </.> 
uh let me now share my position insofar as this matter at issue uh at hand uh
in issue at hand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#64:3:A>
The issue here is whether or not envelope or the contents of
envelope number two is covered or covered by the articles of impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#65:3:A>
It is argued that these are not covered by the articles of
impeachment and therefore it is immaterial and irrelevant as argued by the
prosecution <&> should have been defense </&> as they have done in the past
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#66:3:A>
In fact Mr Chief Justice the phrase <mention> irrelevant and
immaterial </mention> would be the most popular phrase these days
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#67:3:A>
<indig> Pumunta po kayo kahit saang </indig> party <indig> ang
unang sasabihin sa inyo </indig> <quote> Objection your honor on ground that
it is irrelevant and immaterial </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#68:3:A>
<indig> Buong bansa po ay halos abogado na
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#69:3:A>
Ngunit dito po ngayon ang tanungin natin ito ba'y talaga </indig> 
irrelevant and immaterial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#70:3:A>
<indig> Sa akin po kagalang-galang na </indig> Chief Justice
 <indig> hindi po
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#71:3:A>
Ang kagalang-galang na </indig> Chief Justice <indig> ay sinabi
niya doon sa kanyang </indig> extended opinion dated December eighteen
 <quote> In ordering the opening of the first sealed envelope that the
objection based on immateriality would be premature and once the document
obtained in connection therewith are formally offered in evidence that is the
time when objections on materiality can be should be ruled upon </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#72:3:A>
And therefore this issue has been ruled upon by the Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#73:3:A>
<indig> Kaya nga po kangina hinihingi ko kung pupwede ang </indig> 
Chief Justice <indig> muna ang siyang mag-husga dito po sa ating
pinag-uusapan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#74:3:A>
Dahil ito po </indig> irrelevant and immaterial <indig> ay isang
patakaran sa husgado
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#75:3:A>
At sino po ang mag-huhusga
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#76:3:A>
Sino po ang </indig> most qualified to judge on relevance and
materiality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#77:3:A>
It is the Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#78:3:A>
<indig> Kaya po aking hiniling kangina kung sana ang </indig> Chief
Justice under the Rule six of our rules would first decide on this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#79:3:A>
Unfortunately that was not possible because of the motion already
been filed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#80:3:A>
Has this been ruled upon by the Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#81:3:A>
Yes because on January ten two thousand by <.> tu </.> by January
ten two thousand one by order of the Chief Justice this document was
subpoenaed on June <.> Jan </.> January ten two thousand one this <.> su </.> 
this Chief Justice Chief Justice Davide ordered through a subpoena <foreign> 
duces tecum ad testificandum </foreign> that documents related to savings
account number or savings account number zero one six zero six two five o one
dash five be produced
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#82:3:A>
<indig> Bakit po ayaw ng </indig> defense panel <indig> buksan ang
pangalawang </indig> envelope
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#83:3:A>
<indig> Maliwanag po dahil ito po ay pag-aari ni Presidente Joseph
Ejercito Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#84:3:A>
Doon po sa </indig> exhibit triple X <indig> na siyang isang sulat
na ang sabi ni Ocampo pinirmahan ni Pangulong Estrada bilang Jose Velarde ang
nakalagay doon </indig> <mention> my savings account zero one six zero six
two five zero one dash five </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#85:3:A>
<indig> Yan po ang sinabi ni Jose Velarde
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#86:3:A>
Yan po ang sinabi ni Pangulong Aquino ni Pangulong Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#87:3:A>
Maliwanag po na itong </indig> account <indig> na ito ay pag-aari
ni Pangulong Estrada inamin po niya yan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#88:3:A>
Kaya po ayaw buksan ng depensa yan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#89:3:A>
Grounds of relevance and materiality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#90:3:A>
Mr Chief Justice my colleagues envelope number two is relevant and
material in our quest for truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#91:3:A>
Envelope number two is relevant and material for the credibility of
this proceeding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#92:3:A>
<.> E </.> Envelope number two is relevant and material for the
credibility of this institution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#93:3:A>
Envelope number two is relevant and material to the faith of our
people in this democracy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-064#94:3:A>
Thank you Mr President </I>
