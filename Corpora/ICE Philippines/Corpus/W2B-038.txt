<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#4:1>
WITH the need to double food production as a result of the country 's
rapid population growth, scientists and agriculture officials have set their
eyes on biotechnology to increase agricultural productivity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#5:1>
<mention> Biotechnology </mention> simply refers to any technique
that uses living organisms to make or modify a product, to improve plants or
animals, or to develop micro-organisms for specific uses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#6:1>
<quote> &ldquo; For an agricultural country like the Philippines,
biotechnology is bringing new dimensions and possibilities of improving
traditional agricultural practices, &rdquo; </quote> said Reynaldo de la
Cruz, director of the National Institute of Biotechnology and Applied
Microbiology ( Biotech). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#7:1>
Biotechnology may boost crop production through bio-organic
fertilizers, biopesticides, use of diagnostic kits, growth-promoting
substances and plant biotechnology, De la Cruz said. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#8:1>
<h> <bold> Bio-organic fertilizers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#9:1>
These types of fertilizers can be divided into three major groups,
namely: fertilizers from biological nitrogen-fixing organisms, mycorrhiza and
organic fertilizers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#10:1>
After several experiments, scientists were able to isolate these
nitrogen-fixing organisms that are now produced commercially by Biotech. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#11:1>
Biotech has already produced commercially Nitro Plus fertilizer
specifically for such legumes as peanut, mungbean, cowpea, pole <indig> <it>
sitao </it> </indig> and soybean.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#12:1>
Nitro Plus was made from the nitrogen-fixing bacterium rhizobium.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#13:1>
Another fertilizer commercialized by Biotech although it is still
on a limited scale is BIO-N which can be used for rice, corn and sweet
potato.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#14:1>
This was made from the bacterium azospirillum isolated from the roots
of the local grass otherwise known as <indig> <it> talahib </it> </indig> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#15:1>
Azolla, an aquatic fern which can fix atmospheric nitrogen into a
form useful to plants can be used as an N-organic fertilizer for irrigated
lowland rice fields.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#16:1>
It can also be used as feed supplement for poultry, duck and swine.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#17:1>
Nitrogen-fixing blue-green alga ( BGA), otherwise known as
cyanobacteria, can be used to maintain soil nitrogen fertility, said De la
Cruz. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#18:1>
He said it is easy to popularize the use of BGA since it is
abundant in the country thus, it can easily replace chemical nitrogen
fertilizers especially in rice paddies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#19:1>
Biotech now produces commercially VAM ( vesicular-arbuscular)
inoculants for many agricultural crops such as corn, upland rice, eggplant,
tomato, soybean, peanut, mungbean; fruit trees such as papaya, citrus,
<foreign> guyabano </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#20:1>
These are sold in powdered form ( Mykovan-1) or in granulated form (
Mykovan-2). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#21:1>
<h> <bold> Organic fertilizers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#22:1>
For the use of organic fertilizers, De la Cruz recommends
trichoderma technology which simply utilizes compost piles containing
agricultural waste materials such as sawdust, <foreign> bagasse </foreign> ,
rice and straw.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#23:1>
These materials will be inoculated with an activator containing pure
cultures of trichoderma harzianum for rapid decomposition of the compost.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#24:1>
The use of this technology has resulted in the 15-25 percent
increase in rice grain yield compared with rice plants receiving full
inorganic fertilizer rates.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#25:1>
This is equivalent to 13 cavans of rice per hectare during the wet
season and 15 cavans during the dry season. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#26:1>
The trichoderma-azotobacter technology is another alternative for
use by the farmers, said De la Cruz. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#27:1>
He said this involves initially the biodegradation of farm wastes
with trichoderma species.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#28:1>
Before full composting is attained, the decomposing heap is
inoculated with strains of nitrogen-fixing bacterium known as azobacter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#29:1>
This type of bio organic fertilizer has the advantage since large
amounts of potential substrates for organic fertilizer such as rice straw,
rice hull, coffee hulls and animal manures are already in the farms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#33:2>
SCIENTISTS have set their eyes on biotechnology to increase
agricultural productivity, especially with the need to double food production
due to Asia 's increasing population. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#34:2>
Biotechnology is the technique of using living organisms to
modify a product, to improve plants or animals, or to develop micro-organisms
for specific uses. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#35:2>
<h> <bold> Bioinsecticides </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#36:2>
Harmful pests are now controlled mainly by the use of imported
chemical insecticides.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#37:2>
Unfortunately, there are many insects that have developed resistance
to a number of chemical insecticides due to indiscriminate use.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#38:2>
Aside from this, frequent use of chemical insecticides may cause the
accumulation of toxic substances in the environment that will pollute
waterways. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#39:2>
Due to this, scientists have isolated the bacterium <foreign>
<it> Bacillus thuringiensis </it> </foreign> or Bt for the control of major
insect pests.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#40:2>
Distributed worldwide, Bt produces toxins which can kill insect pests
by contact or when ingested. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#41:2>
Reynaldo de la Cruz, director of the National Institute of
Biotechnology and Applied Microbiology ( Biotech), said isolates of Bt had
been found effective for such harmful pests such as the Asian corn borer,
diamondback moth, crucifers and six lepidopterous pests of rice like leaf
folder, green hairy caterpillar, green semilooper, rice caseworm, yellow
stemborer and striped stemborer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#42:2>
Different formulations of bioinsecticides containing Bt strains
are now available in Biotech. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#43:2>
<h> <bold> Diagnostic kits </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#44:2>
A more sensitive, accurate and faster method in detecting virus,
virus-like organisms, fungal and bacterial diseases is the use of monoclonal
antibodies, De la Cruz said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#45:2>
At present, the Bureau of Quarantine which regulates the
introduction of infected plants and plant parts from foreign sources still
uses the traditional methods to detect diseases.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#46:2>
In most cases, they rely on the presentation of phytosanitary
permits.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#47:2>
All traditional methods cannot detect the disease-causing organism
until after the disease had already spread in epidemic proportions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#48:2>
The use of monoclonal antibodies ( MAB) will allow the detection
of papaya ring spot virus in different parts of the plants within 24 hours.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#49:2>
<quote> &ldquo; MAB can detect plants with latent infection even
if visual symptoms are still not evident, &rdquo; </quote> said De la Cruz.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#50:2>
Aside from being environment friendly, this technique can
accurately detect an infected plant material early enough to control
diseases, reduce production inputs and spread of pathogen to non-infected
areas, he said. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#51:2>
<h> <bold> Growth hormones </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#52:2>
Growth hormones extracted from fresh coconut water will promote
the growth and yield of plants such as <indig> <it> pechay </it> </indig> ,
Chinese cabbage, mungbean, soybean, peanut, sweet pepper and tomato under
greenhouse and field trials. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#53:2>
<h> <bold> Plant biotechnology </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#54:2>
The Institute of Plant Breeding in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, College
of Horticulture and College of Forestry now conducts tissue culture or the
propagation of plants from cells or tissues.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#55:2>
Cells and tissues obtained from various parts of the plants are
placed on specific medium containing salts, a carbon source, vitamins,
hormones and other substances.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#56:2>
Protocols have been developed for various plants such as bamboo,
orchids, pineapple, <foreign> camote </foreign> , <indig> ubi </indig> ,
banana and <foreign> falcata </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#57:2>
Likewise, whole plants can now be regenerated from protoplasm
isolated from callus cultures.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#58:2>
Scientists are now testing transgenic plants which are genetically
engineered to accept transient genes from other sources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#59:2>
Transonic planting - - wherein the Bt endotoxin gene from
<foreign> <it> bacillus thuringiensis </it> </foreign> is being transferred
to corn, <indig> <it> pechay </it> </indig> and Chinese cabbage - - is now
being done.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#60:2>
The main purpose is to come up with a plant containing the Bt gene
which is resistant to attacks against pests such as the Asiatic corn borer
and the diamondback moth. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#61:2>
<h> <bold> Livestock production </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#62:2>
Biotechnology could be used in three areas of animal production
namely: reproduction, health and nutrition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#63:2>
Arturo S. Arganosa, acting director of the livestock research
division of the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural
Resources Research and Development said the enormous potential of
biotechnology offers better alternatives and options to improve livestock
production and health. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#64:2>
Biotechnology advances could have direct effects on the animal by
altering its genotype, changing its interaction with the environment or by
improving the nutritive value of foodstuff.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#65:2>
Through bio technologies, Arganosa said more antibiotics could be
used in animal feeding, better vaccines could reduce diseases, and growth
hormones could be improved. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#66:2>
One biotechnique that has stirred the interest of many
researchers is the separation of sperm cells bearing X and Y chromosomes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#67:2>
This attempts to make sex preselection of offsprings in farm animals.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#68:2>
The use of superior female animals may be extended after the
procedures for embryo manipulation has been established. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#69:2>
Another technique in reproductive biotechnologies refers to
understanding the culture requirements of oocytes <foreign> <it> in vitro
</it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#70:2>
This allows the collection of immature oocytes from slaughtered
animals, their maturity and fertilization <foreign> <it> in vitro </it>
</foreign> , and their development to preimplantation stage embryos which can
be transferred to recipient animals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#71:2>
<quote> &ldquo; It therefore becomes possible to harness to
maximum efficiency those oocytes in the ovarian pool to produce better farm
animals, &rdquo; </quote> said Arganosa. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#72:2>
Nuclear and gene transfers can also improve the livestock
industry by potentially reducing the generation interval and genetically
tailoring animals that are economically important. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#73:2>
<h> <it> Biotechnology on <indig> carabaos </indig> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#74:2>
Genetic improvement of <indig> carabaos </indig> is one component
of the <indig> Carabao </indig> Development Program that will ensure the
improvement of quality of the local <indig> carabaos </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#75:2>
Libertado Cruz, executive director of the Philippine <indig>
Carabao </indig> Center, said the concern for genetic improvement was due to
the fact that quality of local <indig> carabaos </indig> has declined during
the last decade due to inbreeding and natural selection biased against the
large males. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#76:2>
This is because farmers tend to select bigger and better work
animals, and then render these animals castrated, making the good males
unavailable for breeding. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#77:2>
In effect the quality of available bulls for natural breeding
remains small and of undesirable quality.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#78:2>
The <indig> carabao </indig> program, said Cruz, focuses on the
judicious selection of breeding animals of both the native stocks and the
dairy breed, specifically the Murrah breed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#79:2>
<quote> &ldquo; In order for the program to enhance the
propagation of highly selected and top performing animals of both types, the
use of newly emerging reproductive biotechniques is in order, &rdquo;
</quote> said Cruz. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#80:2>
The gestation period of <indig> carabao </indig> is rather long
as it takes about five years before the first calf is born.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#81:2>
It is also a very slow process because the <indig> carabao </indig>
unlike swine and other animals would only bear one calf per gestation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#85:3>
WHILE the government recognizes the importance of biotechnology
in increasing agricultural production, there are so many constraints in the
full implementation of biotechnology research. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#86:3>
The National Economic and Development Authority recognizes
biotechnology as the brightest and best prospect for accelerating the country 's
development. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#87:3>
William Padolina, science and technology secretary, is optimistic
that there will be significant progress within the next 10 years in
agricultural biotechnology, especially in the introduction of transgenic crop
plants with resistance to pests and diseases.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#88:3>
Transgenic plants with improved nutritional qualities shall also be
available.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#89:3>
The research and development base for animal biotechnology shall have
been established and work to improve the genetic makeup of local livestock
populations shall be started. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#90:3>
But the government has yet to provide full support to solve the
constraints on biotechnology. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#91:3>
<h> <bold> Problems facing biotechnology </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#92:3>
A World Bank research on agro-biotechnology development in the
Philippines said there is a lack of a feasibility study to give a clear
picture of the demand for certain products and services.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#93:3>
This makes it difficult to evaluate how useful new biotechnology
processes and products will be. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#94:3>
Reynaldo de la Cruz, director of the National Institute of
Biotechnology and Applied Microbiology in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, said the bulk
of research efforts often end at the development stage of technology.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#95:3>
The commercialization aspect is often given less priority due to
limited mechanisms for operationalization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#96:3>
At present, there is an apparent hesitation to risk investment in
biotechnology projects that require further development for
commercialization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#97:3>
At the same time, De la Cruz said, researchers still lack
adequate training and expertise in modern biotechnological techniques.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#98:3>
Indepth training and exposure to new innovative techniques of
molecular biology and DNA technology are wanting, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#99:3>
Research and development efforts have also been perceived as
diffused and lacking in focus, said Marichiel J. Navarro, university
extension specialist of Biotech in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#100:3>
<quote> &ldquo; There is no clear understanding of individual
activities, interests, programs and expertise of each institute, &rdquo;
</quote> said Navarro. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#101:3>
Both De la Cruz and Navarro said modern biotechnology work
hinges on limited research and development facilities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#102:3>
Standard facilities for laboratory and pilot plants are expensive.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#103:3>
Other problems facing scientists are the lack of effective
mechanisms for technology transfer, limited access to information and
ambiguous, ineffective technology development policies.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#104:3>
The latter includes the lack of guidelines related to patent rights,
licenses, publication rights and confidentiality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#105:3>
While constraints seem inevitable, the commitment of the science
community, government support for research and development in biotechnology
and the private sector interest will sustain the advances that have already
been started. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#106:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The potential for production systems to be
tremendously improved and made more efficient exists.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#107:3>
The growing reality, however, is that the prospects for global
competitiveness lie in the very technologies already developed for the local
market, &rdquo; </quote> said De la Cruz. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#108:3>
<h> <bold> Issues on Biosafety </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#109:3>
The use of modern biotechnology in agriculture has raised
concerns about the new techniques because their potential power is so
far-reaching and the number of new products is so great. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#110:3>
It recognizes the importance of providing appropriate regulatory
mechanisms to ensure that products made through the use of new techniques are
as safe as the products of traditional biotechnology. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#111:3>
A research report on Biosafety conducted by the International
Service for National Agricultural Research recommends five principles that
must be considered by national policy makers to ensure the safety of modern
biotechnology products:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#112:3>
*Regulatory review should focus on the characteristics and risks of
the biotechnology product - - not the process by which it is created.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#113:3>
*For biotechnology products requiring review, the review process
should be set up for efficiency and effectiveness while assuring the
protection of public health and environment safety.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#114:3>
*Any additional regulatory requirements for new biotechnology
products should be integrated into the overall regulatory system that governs
the release of new products in the agricultural sector.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#115:3>
*Regulatory programs should be flexible and capable of adapting
quickly to new knowledge and understanding produced by the rapid advances in
biotechnology.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#116:3>
*To create opportunities for the application of innovative
biotechnology products, all regulations in environmental and health areas - -
whether or not they address biotechnology - - should use performance
standards than rigid controls or specific design requirements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-038#117:3>
Biotechnology regulation can be incorporated in existing
legislation to avoid creating a new regulatory infrastructure specifically
for this science. </p> </I>
