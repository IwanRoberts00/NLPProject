<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#3:1>
Softly, she fingered the birthmark below her left knee.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#4:1>
The slight, dark spot was shaped like a butterfly, a pair of wings
spread in perpetual flight.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#5:1>
She had the habit of touching it whenever she had nothing to do, or
when her thoughts carried her very deep into herself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#6:1>
Outside the taxi window, Celeste Africa could see nothing but the
passing glow of neon lights, faintly distorted by the slow and windless
rain--her first sight of Manila in nineteen years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#7:1>
It was morning when she left Logan International, and after a
plane change in San Francisco and a stop-over in Seoul, it was already
evening of the next day in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#8:1>
The pilot informed her of a light drizzle, visibility a few hundred
meters, outside temperature twenty-nine degrees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#9:1>
Celeste was busily computing what twenty-nine degrees would be in
Fahrenheit when the chief purser came over the PA system, thanking her for
flying the friendly skies of <mention> United </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#10:1>
A smile flew its way across her lips, suddenly self-conscious that
she was again indulging in numbers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#11:1>
The coupon taxi that waited for her outside the airport backed out of
the curb to the tune of <mention> &ldquo; London Bridge &rdquo; </mention>
and took her out into the streets of Manila. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#12:1>
From the streets of Manila, her family 's Dodge Coronet had taken
her once in the past in the opposite direction, to the airport, America her
destination.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#13:1>
Then, she was a young seventeen, but her age aside, anyone who looked
into those limpid eyes knew that she was clear about who she was, her gently
pursed lips speaking an assured confidence.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#14:1>
Celeste was, after all, valedictorian of her class at <mention>
Immaculate Conception </mention> , aside from being the owner of every award
they offered, from spelling to speech, from model student to math.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#15:1>
The last she liked best; math had always struck her as signifying an
infinite number of possibilities, just like America. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#16:1>
She carried herself with a budding grace, radiating the same
beauty and life that shone out through her eyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#17:1>
Her lithe body spoke of her youth, holding the promise that the woman
was just butterflying out of her warm cocoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#18:1>
Her light-brown skin wrapped itself tenderly around her supple body,
accentuated by the butterfly below her knee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#19:1>
Celeste and her grandmother clasped hands before the long and
last goodbye; emotions unraveled in a slow, finger-by-finger letting go.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#20:1>
She asked <indig> Tatang </indig> , their driver, to take good care
of her grandmother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#21:1>
As if they were saying it for the very first time, her grandmother
and <indig> Tatang </indig> repeated the lines they kept repeating on the
way, telling her to take good care and to warmly watch over herself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#22:1>
Her eyes were much too salty by the time she entered the
terminal, by the time the Dodge drove away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#23:1>
Celeste wiped her tears, feeling embarrassed that people might see
her all-puffed-up eyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#24:1>
They might think that this young, flat-chested girl had not slept,
and stayed up the whole might like an over-excited kid before her first
plane-trip overseas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#25:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You are a Filipino, Ma'am? &rdquo; </quote> the
taxi driver asked, glancing at the rear-view mirror.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#26:1>
Several garlands fragrant with <foreign> camia </foreign> and <indig>
sampaguita </indig> flowers hung around the mirror, together with a picture
of Jesus intoning God 's blessing on the trip. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#27:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Um yes, &rdquo; </quote> she smiled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#28:1>
Except for the breast, she thought, but that was hardly a proper
thing to say.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#29:1>
She was a late bloomer, and it was in America that her pointed
breasts grew to their present firm, smallish size.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#30:1>
They were not like Nisha Narvane 's, her former roommate, whose
breasts were globes and whose waist the thinnest orbit, enough to transport
Nisha to the many-starred galaxy of Hollywood.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#31:1>
Nisha Narvane ( Celeste always called her by her full name) dreamed
of going back to India, of making it as an actress.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#32:1>
Many nights in their narrow room, Nisha Narvane starred in private
productions as she sang and swayed her <foreign> sari </foreign> - covered
hips for Celeste. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#33:1>
They had started at BU together, when both were new to Boston and
finding America difficult.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#34:1>
At BU and at Bay Bank, where she had got a job as part-time teller,
people called her <mention> Miss Africa </mention> , unintentionally
emphasizing she was different from them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#35:1>
It took some time for Celeste to get used to her beauty-queen status,
and there were many moments when she wished that she could just take her
mother 's maiden name.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#36:1>
Then they would call her <mention> Miss Maria </mention> much more
generic and plain, and not so pointedly different. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#37:1>
The former Aurora Isabel Maria died when Celeste was three.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#38:1>
Celeste remembered the vague, gentle roundness of her mother 's face,
but not much else.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#39:1>
She remembered her father better--a handsome man, fine and sharp
features lining his face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#40:1>
He had disappeared in the early weeks of martial law and was never
again seen, leaving Celeste with her grandmother, who brought her up and whom
she loved very, very much. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#41:1>
Her memory kept deep impressions of voices.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#42:1>
In her mind, the sound of her father 's voice calling her name still
resonated.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#43:1>
He had always brought something home for her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#44:1>
Nobody called her name as beautifully as her father and nothing as
calming to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#45:1>
Her grandmother 's voice was also clear, still promising to teach her
how to weave seamless garments when she was old enough. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#46:1>
In America, people omitted the <mention> 'e' </mention> and
pronounced her name as <mention> &ldquo; Ce-lest. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#47:1>
Between this and being called <mention> Miss Africa </mention> , she
found herself at a loss as to which she detested more.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#48:1>
How many were those she had corrected, once, twice, thrice, up till
she has tired of counting, who just could not call her the way they should,
in the manner of a father calling his daughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#49:1>
She had known herself as <mention> &ldquo; Ce-les-te &rdquo;
</mention> all her life, <indig> <it> may lambing sa dulo </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#50:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Ce-lest &rdquo; </mention> sounded very much like a
foreigner to her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#51:1>
Then Richard came along, in her third year of listening to the
name <mention> &ldquo; Ce-lest &rdquo; </mention> , bringing along with him
the chance of finally ending her reign as <mention> Miss Africa </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#52:1>
From the first moment she met him at Bay Bank, Celeste was madly in
love.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#53:1>
Never mind that he wore his pants high.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#54:1>
She enjoyed and toyed with the idea of being called <mention> Mrs.
Sheridan, Mrs. Sheridan, </mention> repeating the name to herself over and
over again.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#55:1>
How does <mention> Mrs. Sheridan </mention> sound?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#56:1>
Never mind how you pronounce <mention> Celeste </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#57:1>
Doesn't <mention> Ce-lest Sheridan </mention> sound just absolutely
perfect?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#58:1>
She asked Nisha Narvane the nights she did come home to their shared
room, all the time conjuring in her mind life together with her beautiful
Richard, giving birth to his children.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#59:1>
For her, America began to wear a more kindly face, and she thought
that America might fulfill her dreams after all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#60:1>
Celeste was ecstatic half a year into their relationship, deep
into final examinations, when her home pregnancy kit turned pink.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#61:1>
She called Richard with the excited news at John Hancock, where he
worked.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#62:1>
Richard said he was overwhelmed and overjoyed by the news, which made
Celeste turn an even happier shade of pink on her end of the line. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#63:1>
After they had put the phone down, Celeste realized Richard did
not offer to make her <mention> Mrs. Sheridan </mention> , queen of his
household.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#64:1>
He didn't mention anything about the two of them finally getting
married.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#65:1>
Much later, when the operator at John Hancock told her Mr. Sheridan
was out of town more times than she cared to hear, she realized what Richard
meant when he said that he was overwhelmed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#66:1>
Celeste charged to his house and after a foreign exchange of epithets
and invective four-letter word shouts, with an armful of clothes, came crying
home to Nisha Narvane 's arms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#67:1>
Her tears continued all the way into the next morning, and the
day after that, when results came out showing she had failed the advanced
statistics exam.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#68:1>
Over delivered <mention> Domino 's </mention> , she contemplated the
improbability of it all: why her life was falling all in a row, falling for
the wrong man without having counted on it, or even having seen the
possibility of it, fearful that her ability to calculate had been diminished
if not altogether drained and disappeared.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#69:1>
Or, the possibility entered her mind, had she left them behind,
somewhere along the way? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#70:1>
She was in those weeks about to give up her Disney dreams of
America when she felt an unexpected wetness between her legs and her period
came as scheduled that month.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#71:1>
She read the instructions on the kit again and found that she did not
follow the directions and had done the test wrongly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#72:1>
In sobbing tears, she wondered how she could have done the test
wrong, happy at the same time that it was.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#73:1>
And later on, through a clogged nose, and in subdued chuckles beside
a table-top of consumed tissue, Celeste kept repeating to Nisha Narvane the
slogan that stood for what she learned through this period of her life--that
Dick was a dick. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#74:1>
The Sunday afternoon of Celeste and Nisha Narvane 's graduation,
they passed outside the chapel and found that the doves had not yet flown
away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#75:1>
At BU, tradition had it that the many doves of the metal sculpture
would fly away the year all the females in the graduating class were virgins.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#76:1>
They looked at one another and shouted <quote> &ldquo; Dick is a dick
&rdquo; </quote> , making heads turn and confounding other red-garbed
graduates who in their own moment of achievement could care less what it
meant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#77:1>
They had dinner at Hong Kong Cafe, on the ground floor of the
Hojo on Commonwealth Avenue.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#78:1>
The manager offered them silver utensils but they declined and
joyfully fumbled with their chopsticks.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#79:1>
It was the best dinner of their stays in America.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#80:1>
The sound of Hong Kong made Celeste feel very near to her
Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#81:1>
And she thought of her grandmother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#82:1>
Fourteen years she worked for Bay Bank in America, her land of
opportunity, before she got an office with a window.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#83:1>
She left her room with Nisha Narvane along with riding the T for a
Honda parked outside her own two-storey house off Newbury street, in a
district lined with magnolias. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#84:1>
Celeste loved living in a real house once again, after the many
years.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#85:1>
She especially enjoyed the busy week when she furnished her house,
the trips beyond number to Home Depot and the pairs of feet that carried her
fill of furniture into the house, until she dropped with exhaustion onto one
of them with a smile of unexhausted happiness at the blooming magnolias
beyond the window. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#86:1>
It was not long before the house grew unbearably quiet and big
for her, and she pushed the oppressive silence aside with wind chimes by the
door, the whirring sound of a <foreign> shiatsu </foreign> couch, a talking
alarm clock that can learn to say its owner 's name, a radio station that
constantly proclaimed forty percent chance of rain, a television left open
and unwatched.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#87:1>
When the VCR and cable proved finally futile, she went out for a
breath of air. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#88:1>
But outside, she could hear the Charles whisper its disdain at
immigrants who promenaded by its banks alone on long weekends, and she was
lost among the <foreign> colleens </foreign> and the crowd on St. Patrick 's
Day.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#89:1>
The tulips were just starting to bloom when she revisited the swan
rides, but amid the weeping willows she soon found kids who stared unkindly
at single ladies who refused to grow-up, and much more sad, the remembered
memory of who she used to ride with, back when she thought the clouds '
reflection on <mention> John Hancock </mention> was beautiful. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#90:1>
She knew she needed someone, and she reminded herself to be more
social.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#91:1>
The occasional convention outside town she began to welcome.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#92:1>
Once, she went out with the guys from the bank; they told her it was
imperative for her to watch the Celtics ' last game at the Garden.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#93:1>
The special souvenir pennant cost her fourteen dollars and
ninety-five cents.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#94:1>
She especially loved hearing the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall,
remembered her grandmother when she heard them play <mention> &ldquo;
Unforgettable &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#95:1>
But she stopped going when John Williams left and was replaced by
this young and brash Johnny-come-lately.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#96:1>
She resigned herself to sitting beside life-sized Red Auerbach in
Fanueil Hall, who sat and unmindfully calculated court positions with bronze
cigar in hand, and who never answered her queries about his strategies of
success. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#97:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You are away many years? &rdquo; </quote> the
driver piped in again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#98:1>
<quote> &ldquo; More than fifteen. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#99:1>
<quote> &ldquo; So welcome.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#100:1>
You are <indig> balikbayan </indig> <indig> <it> pala </it> </indig> .
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#101:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Thanks. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#102:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You are here for long time? &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#103:1>
<quote> &ldquo; No, just here for a vacation, &rdquo; </quote>
Celeste answered, managing another tired smile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#104:1>
She was happy to see a <indig> <it> kababayan </it> </indig> , a
fellow Filipino who for the sake of being friendly was struggling with his
English, but who could pronounce her name correctly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#105:1>
Not that it mattered any, since it had been years since she heard
anyone call her <mention> &ldquo; Ce-les-te &rdquo; </mention> and the sound
of it seemed far too distant for memory.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-019#106:1>
But the long trip had exhausted her thoroughly, and her journeyed
body was too tired to welcome conversation. </p> </I>
