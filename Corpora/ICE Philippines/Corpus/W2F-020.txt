<bold> By ROGELIO CRUZ </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#3:1>
<bold> There are games friends can play in a resort 's swimming
pool.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#4:1>
The most serious perhaps you can neither teach nor learn, unless you
relax, let yourself just float in the water. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#5:1>
The three played in the pool, Claire more adept than the other
two.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#6:1>
She was into practically every sport imaginable and now she did what
she could in the largish but kidney-shaped pool.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#7:1>
Paolo was a bit athletic himself, although as far as Vincent was
concerned, he was more of a basketball freak.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#8:1>
He tried a couple of times to catch up with Claire 's laps.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#9:1>
Vincent, on the other hand, stayed close to the pipe issuing the water
and tried to enjoy the hot bath for what it was supposed to be - - and the
water was indeed very hot, and the weather was particularly warm.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#10:1>
It was already late-November, and the late afternoon breeze was
getting stronger but not colder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#11:1>
The pool was, in fact, an untiled cemented pit, painted light
blue.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#12:1>
The improvised nature of the place was its genius.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#13:1>
It was nothing near five-star, but its sheer neatness ( except for
that attendant) and simplicity, and most of all the abundance of plants made
it, in its own uncanny way, splendid.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#14:1>
The cottages were as small as a real <indig> <it> kubo </it> </indig>
, but made of sturdier wood; and then they were scattered in the middle of
what was practically a botanical garden.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#15:1>
Aside from the infinite array of trees and ferns and air plants and
flowers in one place at the same time - their robustness was literally
out-of-this-world, they felt animal.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#16:1>
Rural soil must be different.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#17:1>
There were Birds-of-Paradise clusters five feet tall with heads as
large as human fists; palm trees with stems as thick and long as outstretched
human arms, ready to eat you whole; heart-shaped leaves, with stalks a
frighteningly rich and bright green, that could smother your face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#18:1>
On their way to the pool, Vincent picked a small white flower and put
it over Claire 's ear.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#19:1>
He picked another one and put it over his own ear; and he picked yet
another one and put it over Paolo 's ear, but Paolo was bothered by it and
whisked it away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#20:1>
It was all Paolo 's idea; Vincent had known him to be as
impulsive as hell in high school, and now, shoved by the world into college,
he was freer than ever.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#21:1>
He drove all the way from Quezon City to Vincent 's house in
Para&ntilde;aque to play basketball, but when they got to the village
clubhouse, it was closed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#22:1>
He had a mad urge to go somewhere, and of course they had to get
Claire to go with them, too; she was in the same neighborhood anyway.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#23:1>
Three hours later they were m Laguna, Paolo and Vincent swimming in
their shorts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#24:1>
They arrived at the resort late in the afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#25:1>
An attendant emerged behind the gate, in a soiled haIf-open shirt and
escorted them disenchantedly to their cottage.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#26:1>
When the attendants saw them disrobing by the poolside, they knew
what to do and turned on the pumps, in an equally disenchanted manner.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#27:1>
The three were the only people in the pool at the time; they seemed
to be the only people in the resort, aside from a dozen corporate people
engrossed in their seminar in the function rooms, physically and
psychologically distant from them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#28:1>
Claire swam to Vincent near the pipe, and Paolo, left alone on
the other end of the pool, walked to them - - walked, for the water was only
up to their breasts.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#29:1>
She gently leaned backwards, until she lay floating on the water, her
arms apart; her legs in a gentle pedaling motion that sent her moving around
slowly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I can never do that, &rdquo; </quote> Vincent
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#31:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I couldn't, either. &rdquo; </quote> Paolo said,
too. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#32:1>
Vincent was looking at Claire and when she saw him she stopped
and stood up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#33:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#34:1>
Oh, it 's easy, &rdquo; </quote> she said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#35:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The key to it is, you have to relax.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#36:1>
Belly up, neck straight.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#37:1>
Nice and easy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#38:1>
If you get tense, <indig> <it> wala na </it> </indig> . &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#39:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I used to be able to do it before, but now I can 't,
and I really don't know why, &rdquo; </quote> Vincent continued. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#40:1>
&ldquo; I can teach you to float on your back, &rdquo; </quote>
Claire offered Vincent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#41:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Come.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#42:1>
I could guide you with my hands. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#43:1>
&ldquo; Oh no, never mind, &rdquo; </quote> Vincent replied
quickly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#44:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I knew, I <it> knew </it> how to, when I was a kid,
but I can't pull it off anymore... &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#45:1>
&ldquo; That 's why I 'll teach you again, &rdquo; </quote>
Claire said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#46:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Come on, Vince.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#47:1>
It 's simple". </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#48:1>
<quote> &ldquo; No, never mind. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#49:1>
&ldquo; Why won't you? &rdquo; </quote> Claire asked, frowning at
him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#50:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Paolo, could you help me with him? &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#51:1>
Paolo looked at Vincent, sneering, and raised his hands from
underneath the water, feigning to grab him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#52:1>
Claire also giggled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#53:1>
<quote> <indig> <it> &ldquo; Sige na, &rdquo; </it> </indig> </quote>
she said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#54:1>
Vincent moved slowly away from them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#55:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I can't believe this. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#56:1>
Paolo chased him very slowly, hopping in slow motion, through the
water, laughing, until both of them reached the other end of the pool.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#57:1>
Suddenly they forgot their purpose.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#58:1>
Claire again swam to them - - she was quite a graceful swimmer - -
and emerged from the water smiling.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#59:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Let 's play a game.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#60:1>
One of us is going to ask another one a question, and that guy has to
ask <it> another </it> person another question.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#61:1>
If he can't ask another guy another question in, like, three counts,
then the guy <it> has </it> to answer the question he 's asked.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#62:1>
Gets? &rdquo; </quote> <&> teen-age slang for &ldquo; do you get it?
&rdquo; </&> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#63:1>
Paolo stroked the stubble on his chin, grinning, <quote> &ldquo;
Hmmm.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#64:1>
Worth a try. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#65:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Okay, Pao, you start. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#66:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Okay.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#67:1>
Bink, &rdquo; </quote> Paolo started, <quote> &ldquo; Are you still a
virgin? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#68:1>
Vincent was startled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#69:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Uh, Claire: How do you see yourself ten years from
now? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#70:1>
Claire answered: <quote> &ldquo; Vince, who was your first crush?
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#71:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Pao, whatever drove you to bring us to this place
all of a sudden? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#72:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Bink, if you had the chance to do it right now,
would you? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#73:1>
Vincent looked at Claire momentarily, apologetic.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#74:1>
<quote> &ldquo; God, Pao...

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#75:1>
Uh, what do you <it> mean </it> by 'doing it'? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#76:1>
<quote> <indig> <it> &ldquo; Bink, ba't ayaw mong magpahawak kay

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#77:1>
<quote> <indig> <it> &ldquo; Ha? </it> &ldquo; </indig> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#78:1>
Vincent sighed and rolled his eyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#79:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Claire, what do we do with this <foreign> nimshi
</foreign> <&> word not familiar to me </&> ? " </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#80:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What do you think, Vince?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#81:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What do you think, Claire? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#82:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Pao, has your friend always been like this?
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#83:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Vincent: have you ever french-kissed someone?
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#86:1>

</quote> </p>

</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#89:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Vincent, what do you think of Paolo? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#90:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Paolo, why are you so obsessed with sex? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Claire: what 's 2 plus 2? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#92:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Vince, what 's so wrong with sex? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#93:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Pao, look at what you 've led us to.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#94:1>
I mean...

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#95:1>
Pao, uh-wait!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#96:1>
Pao: who do you love? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#97:1>
And so on and so forth, until they grew tired of the game,
probably in part because no one could be caught and penalized.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#98:1>
Vincent was almost caught a number of times, but he always managed to
ask at the last count, and the other two, being unusually just, let him get
away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#99:1>
And indeed, most of the questions Paolo asked were about sex.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#100:1>
Minutes later, Vincent announced that he wanted to get out of the
water already.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#101:1>
He asked Paolo and Claire if they wanted to quit, too, and Paolo
replied that they 'd been in the water for only an hour.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#102:1>
Claire said she wanted to stay longer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#103:1>
Vincent went to the shower room alone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#104:1>
Vincent discovered that as the shower was left running, for some
reason the water became hotter and hotter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#105:1>
There were also no cold water taps.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#106:1>
Desperate to get the soap off his body, he alternated among all the
six showers in the room, turning one off, running to the next and turning it
on, then off, and then to the next.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#107:1>
Eventually, though, all the showers turned too hot.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#108:1>
He tried to stand it as much as he could, just to get the soap off;
but in the end he felt he had slightly burned a part of his back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#109:1>
When Vincent returned to the pool, changed into a tie-dyed pair
of shorts, he saw Claire helping Paolo float on his back.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#110:1>
He was lying with arms out too far, legs moving clumsily.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#111:1>
Claire was at his side, one hand under the small of his back and the
other near a shoulder blade.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#112:1>
His belly protruded from the water, his glistening wet face smiling.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#113:1>
They laughed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#114:1>
Vincent stood by the pool and watched them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#115:1>
He sat by the side and put his legs into the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#116:1>
His face suddenly broke into a smile. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#117:1>
Shortly Paolo had enough.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#118:1>
He stood up in the water and said he felt like getting out already,
too.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#119:1>
On his way to the shower, Vincent warned him about the hot water and
told him not to bother soaping anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#120:1>
Claire said she would go to the showers after a few minutes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#121:1>
Paolo in the showers and Claire having gotten out of the pool as
well, Vincent remained with his feet in the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#122:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I think I burned my back, &rdquo; </quote> he said,
Claire behind him, unfolding a towel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#123:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What? &rdquo; </quote> she asked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#124:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I think I burned my back, &rdquo; </quote> he
repeated, turning his head to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#125:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The shower was freaking hot. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#126:1>
Claire hung her towel on the back of a monobloc chair and went
to Vincent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#127:1>
She squatted behind him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#128:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's reddish, but does it hurt? &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#129:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Hindi naman </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#130:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#131:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#132:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There 's some Noxzema in my bag.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#133:1>
Can you get it and put some over this? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#134:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Sure. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#135:1>
She got up and went to his bag, on the poolside table.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#136:1>
She returned with the large imported jar of Noxzema, took a moderate
amount of it in her fingers, and spread it lightly and slowly over Vincent 's
reddish back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#137:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Shit, Vincent, &rdquo; </quote> she said,
breaking their silence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#138:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What, &rdquo; </quote> he said, alert in a
second. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#139:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'm really in love with him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#140:1>

</p>

<quote> <indig> <it> &ldquo; Selos ka ba? &rdquo; </it> </indig>
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#143:1>
She bit her lower lip. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#144:1>
<quote> <indig> <it> &ldquo; 0o ba </it> . </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#145:1>
I 'm so jealous I can't take it anymore. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#146:1>
She laughed gently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#147:1>
Paolo in bermuda shorts appeared from behind the giant palm
trees, and loudly complained about the outrageously hot showers with no cold
watertaps.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#148:1>
He gruffly continued to dry himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#149:1>
Vincent told Claire the Noxzema was enough; if he didn't ask her to
stop she probably wouldn't.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#150:1>
After Paolo had dried himself, he went over to Vincent by the pool,
and Vincent greeted him with a splash of water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#151:1>
Paolo swore and told him to quit.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#152:1>
Vincent stood up and punched him strongly on the small of his back.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#153:1>
Paolo hollered at him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#154:1>
He showed his burned back, and Paolo looked at it curiously for one
second.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#155:1>
Then both of them stared blankly at the pool, wondering what they
should do next, Paolo 's arm resting lightly around Vincent 's waist, and
Vincent 's arm hung over Paolo 's shoulder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#156:1>
Suddenly, after looking behind them to Claire, who was combing
her hair, Vincent, grinning, dragged Paolo away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#157:1>
Paolo followed, limping on purpose like a ragdoll. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#158:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Know what?" </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#159:1>
Vincent asked him when they were but barely out of earshot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#160:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#161:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Claire and you will make a perfect couple!
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#162:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Huh? &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#163:1>
Paolo exclaimed, eyes wide.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#164:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What are you talking about?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#165:1>
What are you - - screw you.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#166:1>
Stop this.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#167:1>
Go away. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#168:1>
He scrambled away from Vincent 's arm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#169:1>
He returned to Claire and Vincent followed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#170:1>
The three sat down at the round poolside table and decided they
would have a snack.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#171:1>
After calling a waiter and ordering, Paolo seemed to be in a better
mood; and so while waiting, he and Vincent sang, with a bit of choreography;
an Old Purefoods Chicken Nugget commercial jingle, while Claire buried her
face in her hands and giggled uncontrollably.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-020#172:1>
By this time, the sun had almost set; the attendants (
disenchantedly) started turning on the lights over the pool, on the
