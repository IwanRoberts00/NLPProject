11 June 2001

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#6:1>
10:54 a.m.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#7:1>
Going back to Queenstown from Mt. Cook, we passed several farms
again... <quote> &ldquo; and on these farms, we found some sheep,
eyay-eyay-o! &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#8:1>
Seriously, <indig> sobrang dami talagang sheep! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#9:1>
They would dot the landscape and at one point, Mike said: <quote>
<indig> &ldquo; Para silang parasites, ano? &rdquo; </indig> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#10:1>
They were just there grazing, heads bowed to reach the grass or hay,
even if it had snow or frost.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#11:1>
I also saw some brown cattle, and then some black cattle.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#12:1>
<indig> Sabi ko, first time kong makakita ng black na cattle.
</indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#13:1>
Mike deadpans: <indig> <quote> &ldquo; dyan galing ang black angus".
</quote> </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#14:1>
Since it was close to winter, <indig> syempre </indig> , darkness
fell early.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#15:1>
And boy, the roads were very dark, <indig> talaga </indig> ,
specially since the farmhouses were miles and miles away from each other.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#16:1>
And the roads were two lanes <indig> lang </indig> , <indig> tapos
</indig> you have the lake or a farm on either side of the road.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#17:1>
<indig> Mahusay ang kanilang mga drivers. </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#18:1>
Queenstown is a small town with a tiny population which triples
during winter because it has NZ 's premier ski resorts.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#19:1>
Our hotel was Copthorne Lakefront Resort Hotel, and the view from the
restaurant was fantastic!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#20:1>
Plus, it was walking distance <indig> lang </indig> from the town
proper, called <mention> &ldquo; The Town Center &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#21:1>
Here you 'll find all kinds of restaurants, and a few shops.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#22:1>
After checking in, we walked to the town, looking for a seafood
restaurant.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#23:1>
Alas, the one recommended by the hotel was closed for renovation!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#24:1>
So we ended up having dinner at Lone Star, after reviewing its menu
which was placed outside the restaurant, plus <indig> sobrang lamig na
</indig> and I wanted to enter any building <indig> na </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#25:1>
We shared the pumpkin soup and salad, and then I had one dozen NZ
mussels while Mike had venison steak.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#26:1>
It was lovely because we were seated quite close to the fireplace,
and the food was wonderful!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#27:1>
From there, we walked back to the hotel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#28:1>
It was an uphill climb back and with the cold and the thin air,
<indig> hiningal kami ni Mike </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#29:1>
The following day, we had the buffet breakfast in the hotel, and
then we were on our way to Milford Sound.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#30:1>
Again, it was a long way off so we had to take a teabreak again
midway.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#31:1>
We went to Te Anau, which is a farming village.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#32:1>
We saw the town proper also, and it was like being transported back
to <mention> Little House on the Prairie </mention> , with the small shops
and farms, farms, farms! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#33:1>
From there, we also made several stops for <indig> Kodakan
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#34:1>
Again, the views were breathtaking, and since the bus had a glass
ceiling, all around <indig> talaga maganda yung view </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#35:1>
We had a scenic cruise on Milford Sound, and again, we were
surrounded by snow-capped mountains, and we would see waterfalls here and
there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#36:1>
We had lunch on the boat, and after lunch and complimentary coffee
and tea, we spent much of our time on the top deck just taking it all in.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#37:1>
Of course I kept thanking God for all my blessings, specially for
having been given the opportunity to see His magnificent creation, and how I
wanted for Mamey to see this masterpiece!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#38:1>
The weather was wonderful ( it was raining the previous week) so we
felt doubly blessed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#39:1>
It was just so peaceful out there, on the boat, looking at the
scenery, even if again it was a little cold because of the light breeze.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#40:1>
Then in this wonderful setting, Mike goes, <quote> <indig> &ldquo;
Kaya pala talagang namatay si Jack sa Titanic, ano?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#41:1>
Ang lamig siguro ng tubig! &rdquo; </quote> Nyek! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#42:1>
Talk about destroying the moment.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#43:1>
<indig> Tawa kami ng tawa! </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#44:1>
From there, we drove back to Queenstown, passing by Te Anau again
and stopping for a bit longer so people could have a light snack and also to
look around the shops.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#45:1>
Mike and I just had ice cream there, and as usual, I bought my fridge
magnet in the souvenir shop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#46:1>
Back at Queenstown, I was dying to have soup and rice, so we went
to a Chinese restaurant.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#47:1>
We had lots of food, and the taste was quite good <indig> naman
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#48:1>
<indig> Hindi siya </indig> Europeanized or Americanized Chinese, so
happy <indig> naman kami. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#49:1>
We saw a McCafe in the center too, so of course we had to try that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#50:1>
We then walked back to the hotel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#51:1>
Scheduled for Thursday was a half-day city tour.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#52:1>
We found out that we were the only ones taking that tour so <indig>
na-solo namin yung </indig> tour guide and car.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#53:1>
<indig> Nagka-official photographer tuloy kami! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#54:1>
We first went to the A. J. Hackett bridge where <foreign> bungee
</foreign> jumping was born.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#55:1>
Unfortunately, we got there five minutes too late!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#56:1>
We missed somebody who <foreign> bungee </foreign> jumped!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#57:1>
It 's really a little crazy to be <foreign> bungee </foreign> jumping
in that kind of a weather, but I guess they 're really crazy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#58:1>
Our guide said that a couple even exchanged marriage vows on the
bridge, and <foreign> bungee </foreign> jumped right after.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#59:1>
What happens is after you jump, you are lowered on to a raft on the
river below, and then you walk up the stairs back to the bridge.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#60:1>
And the fee is not exactly cheap.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#61:1>
Through all the years, only one minor accident has been recorded.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#62:1>
Then we went to the first vineyard the South Island had.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#63:1>
It had a really nice shop and of course, it had wine tasting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#64:1>
That would have been free had we taken the &ldquo; wine cave tour
&rdquo; but we opted not to do so ( I saw that <indig> na kasi </indig> at
the Napa Valley.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#65:1>
<indig> Naks </indig> ! ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#66:1>
So we paid for the wine tasting <indig> na lang </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#67:1>
That 's Mike 's frustration with me <indig> kasi </indig> I don't
take wine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#68:1>
So he 's still trying to convince me to take it up.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#69:1>
After that, we went to Arrowtown, a place which had a gold rush in
the early 20th century.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#70:1>
We went to the museum, and on one part of the museum, there was a
timeline which traced important events, not only in New Zealand, but in the
world.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#71:1>
Of course, not all years were represented, but would you believe that
it had <quote> &ldquo; 1986: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted
from power &rdquo; </quote> .?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#72:1>
<indig> Sobra kaming nagulat ni Mike! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#73:1>
If we thought the other villages we went to were quaint, this was
even more so.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#74:1>
It had a population of 1,800 people.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#75:1>
<indig> Mas maraming tao pa sa Marcelo or Merville! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#76:1>
And guess what?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#77:1>
It had a golf course!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#78:1>
<indig> Sobrang malumanay ang mga tao </indig> . They would greet you
warmly every time you entered a shop.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#79:1>
I bought some door stoppers in this Pottery Shop, for Tagaytay.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#80:1>
Again, the day was cold as the temp was - 4 degrees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#81:1>
Then we went back to the hotel, <indig> mga 2 p.m. na yun
</indig> , and we decided to just order room service because it was too cold.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#82:1>
Late in the afternoon, we went back to The Town Center so we could
take the <foreign> gondola </foreign> ( <indig> parang </indig> cable car)
which would take us to the top of the mountain.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#83:1>
As usual, <indig> ang ganda na naman nung view </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#84:1>
We decided to do it at this time <indig> para </indig> we could see
Queenstown during the day, and then at night on our way down.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#85:1>
When we got there, we went to the observation deck, and it snowed!!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#86:1>
God is so good <indig> talaga </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#87:1>
Imagine, we didn't expect that but it happened!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#88:1>
We just walked around and watched a short video about New Zealand.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#89:1>
Then we took the <foreign> gondola </foreign> back to The Town
Center.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#90:1>
It was our last night in Queenstown so we just kept on walking and
walking, until we reached their Boardwalk- <indig> parang </indig> a row of
restaurants beside the casino and the lake.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#91:1>
We decided on this restaurant which had lots of awards mounted on
their walls, plus it had oysters, <indig> at medyo fine dining pa </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#92:1>
Mike had clam chowder soup ( <indig> ang sarap-sarap </indig> ) while
I had the half-dozen oysters.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#93:1>
My main course was lobster and Mike 's was this delicious fish.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#94:1>
( I can't remember <indig> na kung </indig> kingfish, codfish, or
whatever <indig> kasi ang dami naming pinagpilian </indig> from the menu,
<indig> eh </indig> ! )

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#95:1>
As usual, I was so corny and had a Diet Coke with it, not wine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#96:1>
Such a lovely dinner that one.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#97:1>
Then it was back to the hotel to pack our clothes for our trip to
Auckland the next day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#98:1>
We were picked up at 10 a.m. the next day so we had a leisurely
breakfast, and we made sure we sat where the view of the mountains was best.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#99:1>
Again, God is so good <indig> talaga </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#100:1>
By the way, our timing <indig> pala </indig> was excellent.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#101:1>
We left Queenstown on Friday, and the ski season was going to start
that Saturday!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#102:1>
And because of the huge amount of snow which has fallen on the
mountains already, arrivals were up 50% versus prior year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#103:1>
So <indig> eksakto yung pag-alis namin </indig> ( not to mention our
rates). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#104:1>
Queenstown 's airport was tiny, but the location was superb!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#105:1>
When our flight was called, we walked out of the terminal, towards
the plane, and again, the view was breathtaking.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#106:1>
<indig> Sayang nga </indig> I didn't have a picture there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#107:1>
But Mike and I fell in love with the South Island.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#108:1>
<indig> Atche </indig> , this is a must see for you!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#109:1>
KuPet 's been there and he agrees that the scenery is glorious!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#110:1>
Getting there is a little expensive, but operating expenses are so
much less than in Europe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#111:1>
I 'll have to end this here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#112:1>
New Zealand Part 3 will be about Auckland. </p> </I>

13 June 2001

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#118:2>
11:01 a. m. ( continued today, 14 June, 8:03 a. m.)

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#119:2>
Our flight to Auckland from Queenstown was right on sked.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#120:2>
Landing in Auckland, we knew already that we were in the city.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#121:2>
Not just that the airport was so much bigger, but there were just so
many people!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#122:2>
It 's not like landing in LA or SF, but coming from the serene South
Islands, this was a little jolting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#123:2>
The shuttle was right outside waiting for us and we were brought
straight to our hotel, the Sky City Casino Hotel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#124:2>
Auckland is your regular big city - - traffic lights in every street
corner, a road construction, tall buildings, lots of people walking, shops
and shops and shops.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#125:2>
Auckland has a population of 1.3M, so that 's more than a third of
NZ 's total population.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#126:2>
The mix was very interesting: lots of Caucasians of course, but
there were so many Orientals.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#127:2>
And they weren't tourists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#128:2>
After settling in and checking out the maps, we walked to the
Catholic Church to find out their mass sked for the following day, Saturday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#129:2>
Since Sunday was our travelling day, we wanted to make sure that we
would be able to hear the anticipated mass on Saturday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#130:2>
<indig> Nyek </indig> , there were no anticipated masses in
Auckland!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#131:2>
So we decided to hear mass early Saturday morning <indig> na lang
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#132:2>
After doing that, we walked around again and looked for a place for
lunch.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#133:2>
The work bug caught up with us as we saw a McDonald 's store with a
new burger that they launched.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#134:2>
So, we had to try out that product.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#135:2>
Okay <indig> naman </indig> - true to McDo fashion, bland, but the
dressing was good.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#136:2>
From there, we walked to the Imax theatre.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#137:2>
Neither one of us has watched an Imax movie so this was quite a
treat.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#138:2>
Every screening was a new movie so we decided on Cyberworld, the
first 3D animated movie ( the others were on Michael Jordan and some other
old stuff).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#139:2>
While waiting for the movie, we passed the time away in a Barnes &
Noble bookstore, again a throwback to our New Jersey days when we 'd spend so
much time in B&N!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#140:2>
Books are really so much cheaper here in Manila, thank God for that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#141:2>
So we just read and read.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#142:2>
The movie was cool!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#143:2>
Actually, it 's the 3D glasses and the Imax effects which were cool.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#144:2>
<indig> Ang galing pala nun! </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#145:2>
Plus of course the screen was so huge!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#146:2>
We kept on saying how much the kids would have enjoyed that
experience.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#147:2>
From there, we walked around again, tried to shop but alas, found
nothing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#148:2>
My travel agent was right: there 's nothing to buy in NZ.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#149:2>
Finally, we saw some name brands and they obviously catered to the
Japanese: Louis Vitton, Ferragamo, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#150:2>
None of the mainstream brands like Nine West, Gap, Bass, <foreign>
etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#151:2>
We decided to walk back to the hotel and go to the casino. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#152:2>
We told ourselves we 'd spend &dollar;10 each on the slot
machines-and that 's 10 NZ dollars, not US!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#153:2>
( That 's around &peso;220 each!)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#154:2>
<indig> Eh </indig> , while we were on our way to the casino, a guy
gave us a &dollar;5 coupon which can be redeemed if we spend at least
&dollar;5 inside the casino.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#155:2>
<indig> Tapos </indig> , they had a scratch card promo <indig> pa
</indig> where they 'd give you a card as you enter the casino.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#156:2>
We got our cards and each of us won &dollar;5!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#157:2>
So we redeemed the &dollar;5 from the card, and then got the
&dollar;5 from the coupon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#158:2>
So, our &dollar;10 was free for each of us!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#159:2>
<indig> Babaw, ano? </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#160:2>
So we went to the 10-cent slot machines and our money lasted for a
little over an hour.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#161:2>
Then we had a late dinner in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#162:2>
We had hot and sour soup, mixed vegetables and pigeon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#163:2>
Again, <indig> masarap sya </indig> and quite reasonable even if it
was in the hotel <indig> na </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#164:2>
The following day was free.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#165:2>
We didn't ask the travel agency to book any tours for us as we
decided to do it ourselves <indig> na lang </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#166:2>
We had our buffet breakfast in the coffee shop, then we walked to
St. Patrick 's Cathedral ( wow, <indig> kala mo </indig> New York!) for the 8
a.m. mass.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#167:2>
As expected, there were lots of <indig> Pinoys </indig> in the
congregation, and it was a Saturday morning mass!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#168:2>
I 'm sure <indig> mas marami pa kung Sunday </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#169:2>
The church was quite simple in design, but you would feel very much
at peace there, specially since it was in the middle of the city and the
business district, at that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#170:2>
From there, we tried walking to a terminal where we could catch the
Hop on-hop off bus for the city tour, but it suddenly rained hard so we took
a cab <indig> na lang </indig> to the first stop we wanted to go to: Kelly
Tarlston 's.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#171:2>
This is like an educational Antarctica attraction.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#172:2>
It talks about life in Antarctica, the conditions there, and most
specially the animal life there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#173:2>
We saw real penguins and real snow, and you take this short ride so
you can come close to the penguins.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#174:2>
It also has a huge aquarium, similar to that in Sentosa but pales in
comparison to Ocean Park, with a walkalator so you can see all the sealife.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#175:2>
Of course at the end, <indig> ang walang kamatayang </indig>
souvenir shop.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#176:2>
I found this place not too value-for-money, and yet it 's the
&hash;1 attraction in Auckland! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#177:2>
From there we took the city bus and went to the Auckland Museum.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#178:2>
Now this one was a real treat!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#179:2>
It has three floors and a lot of it was devoted to their <foreign>
Maori </foreign> heritage.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#180:2>
Most interesting to me though was the section on the wars.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#181:2>
They made it so poignant because the displays showed quotes from
letters of either the people who served in the wars, or their relatives who
kept on waiting and praying for them to come back.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#182:2>
It even had a section which asked people, if they served in the war,
to write down their names, battalion numbers ( or whatever), where they
served, <foreign> etc. </foreign> , and these notes were displayed too.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#183:2>
<indig> Nakakakilabot </indig> because I read some notes which said
they were POWs or escapees, how long they were imprisoned, <foreign> etc.
</foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#184:2>
It really made me thank God that I have not lived through a war, and
I prayed intently that none of us would ever have to go through that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#185:2>
It was also very touching because NZ really offered its armed forces
as a peacekeeping force, and offered its women as part of the medical
contingent.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#186:2>
<indig> Kumbaga </indig> , they could have stayed in the background
but didn't.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#187:2>
They also devoted several walls with the names of the New Zealanders
who fought and died engraved on the walls.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#188:2>
It was touching how some names had tiny red flowers beside them, to
signify that they have not been forgotten.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#189:2>
Much smaller, but no less poignant, was the section on the
Holocaust.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#190:2>
Definitely, it was not as heartbreaking as The Holocaust Museum in
Washington DC, but it was not possible not to feel anger yet again for
Hitler.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#191:2>
It had audiotapes of interviews with the survivors, and of course
lots of pictures and mementos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#192:2>
I thought we 'd stay there for only an hour, but we were there
for almost three hours.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#193:2>
It was truly worth going to.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#194:2>
While waiting for the bus on the steps of the museum, we had another
treat ( or trick?).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#195:2>
A group of Indians suddenly set up what looked like a tripod on a
clear, cemented space fronting the museum, and we thought it was your usual
tour group posing for a picture.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#196:2>
And then, somebody turned on a tape, and Indian music came on.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#197:2>
Then one of the teen girls, suddenly started dancing!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#198:2>
<indig> Yun bang </indig> dance that we see in the Indian MTV
channel on cable.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#199:2>
I 'm sure all of you are quite familiar with how they dance, with
their jerky moves, and the music they dance to!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#200:2>
<indig> Tawa kami ng tawa ni Mike. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#201:2>
<indig> Sabi namin </indig> , <quote> now we 've seen everything!
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#202:2>
And then it rained again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#203:2>
<indig> Hala, sige pa rin ang sayaw! </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#204:2>
We then had a very late lunch in the city again, and then we
just kept on walking and walking around again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#205:2>
We chanced upon this shop selling stuff for the house so I bought a
few things for Tagaytay- <indig> lalagyan ng </indig> sugar and cream,
condiments, that sort of stuff.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#206:2>
It was 4 p.m., and then the shops started closing <indig> na
</indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#207:2>
Bad trip!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#208:2>
<indig> Buti na lang </indig> one bookstore continued to be open so
we looked around some more.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#209:2>
Then, after deciding that there was nothing else to do, we went back
to the hotel and caught Game 6 of the Sixers-Bucks game live.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#210:2>
After that, went up the Sky City Tower, which is the highest
structure in NZ.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#211:2>
It 's higher than the Eiffel Tower and a bunch of other tall
buildings in the world.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#212:2>
Needless to say, the view from up there was quite impressive also.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#213:2>
Of course not as breathtaking as the view in the South Island,
<indig> pero maganda na rin. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#214:2>
We stayed there a long time, just walking around in the observation
deck.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#215:2>
We had wanted to eat in the revolving restaurant but reservations
had to be done weeks in advance <indig> pala </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#216:2>
As in Queenstown, we chose to go up before dusk so we could see
Auckland with and without lights.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#217:2>
It was our last night, so of course, we thanked God again for
keeping us safe and warm throughout our vacation, and also for taking good
care of the kids ( who actually had the time of their lives too, having slept
over in a friend 's house, and having their best friends from Southbay sleep
in our house!).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#218:2>
We then walked out into the city again and had dinner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#219:2>
We went back to the hotel to pack our stuff.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#220:2>
The shuttle fetched us at 4:15 a.m. the next day for our trip back
home.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#221:2>
This time, we had only two legs: first to Sydney, and then a
non-stop Sydney-Mla.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#222:2>
We had a 3-hour layover in Sydney so we just went around
windowshopping.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#223:2>
Nothing to buy really, except a <foreign> mahjong </foreign> set.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#224:2>
This is really for Mamey in Tagaytay because she doesn't want to
play <foreign> mahjong </foreign> in the clubhouse, but in our house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#225:2>
It 's a little smaller than the usual <indig> pero may </indig>
numbers, so Mamey should be fine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#226:2>
Our flights were uneventful, and when we landed in Manila, Jaime and
the kids were there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#227:2>
And of course, our first meal was in Jollibee.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#228:2>
Yummy <indig> ang </indig> Chickenjoy and Fish n Rice! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-011#229:2>
Thanks to everyone for their prayers. </p> <O> smiley face </O>
</I>
