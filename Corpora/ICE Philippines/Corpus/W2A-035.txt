<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#3:1>
<it> Men have always regarded air as a source on life.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#4:1>
However, they have continued to use it as a space to discharge solid,
liquid and gaseous materials.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#5:1>
Men have remained even ignorant to the fact that pollutants added to
the air are reactants in reactions which are taking place in our atmosphere.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#6:1>
Acid rainfall, global climatic effects, lead particles, photo chemical
smog and other known problems are the legacy of not keeping our atmosphere
clean.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#7:1>
These have led to ever-increasing health, aesthetic and economic
effects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#8:1>
This paper discusses the condition of our atmosphere in
Metropolitan Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#9:1>
In doing this, proper control of air pollution and effective
management of our atmosphere can be properly implemented. </it> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#10:1>
<h> <bold> COMPOSITION OF OUR ATMOSPHERE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#11:1>
First, let us look at what we normally expect to find in our
atmosphere and what substances introduced by men alter the air composition.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#12:1>
The troposphere, the region of the atmosphere of great concern in
this paper, is normally composed of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases, as
shown in Table 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#13:1>
Another component of air is water vapor, which is about 1 to 3
per cent by volume.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#14:1>
However, other gases are added to the atmosphere locally, due to
natural processes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#15:1>
One example is volcanic eruption.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#16:1>
The recent eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo have greatly affected our air
composition.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#17:1>
Hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids as well as large quantities of
the oxides of sulfur have been emitted.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#18:1>
They also added a great deal of dust and particulate matter like ash.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#19:1>
These eruptions have not only affected us but other countries as
well.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#20:1>
Therefore, the effect is global in nature. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#21:1>
<h> <bold> TYPES OF POLLUTANTS: SOURCES AND EFFECTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#22:1>
Literally, any substance not normally present in the air, or
measured in greater than normal concentrations, are considered to be air
contaminants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#23:1>
However, a substance is usually not labeled as such until its
presence and concentration produce or contribute to the production of some
deleterious effect ( Danielson 1973).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#24:1>
CO2 is not considered a pollutant as it is a material component of
the atmosphere and takes part in no significant chemical reactions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#25:1>
However, it is not natural to have it present in ever-increasing
concentration which is now affecting us globally.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#26:1>
It is formed by oxidation and combustion processes both natural and
manmade.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#27:1>
In 1860, CO2 was measured to be 292 ppm, in 1950, 310 ppm, and by
1970, 375 ppm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#28:1>
These data were taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii ( Pryde
1973).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#29:1>
To date, CO2 concentrations have increased by nearly 25% since
industrialization ( Vargas 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#30:1>
The result of the increased CO2 content is an increase in the earth 's
mean temperature with even more deleterious effects such as rising water
levels along coasts and rivers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#31:1>
This also can change precipitation patterns.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#32:1>
This is why CO2 is called a greenhouse gas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#33:1>
The glass roof of a greenhouse allows shortwave light energy to pass
through the inside but does not allow heat energy to escape to the outside,
which keeps the inside temperature higher than the outside temperature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#34:1>
CO2 in our atmosphere has a similar effect-CO2 molecules absorb heat
energy and prevent its passage into spaces from the lower atmosphere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#35:1>
Carbon monoxide is derived in urban areas from automobiles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#36:1>
Transportation may account for over 90% in weight of all CO in the
air in large cities, especially if little heavy industry is involved. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#37:1>
CO has a bad effect on health.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#38:1>
It passes through the lungs directly into the blood stream.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#39:1>
It has a toxic effect caused by the affinity of hemoglobin in the
blood to CO molecules.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#40:1>
Hemoglobin functions to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body
tissue.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#41:1>
Since CO combines with hemoglobin strongly, it prevents the carrying
of oxygen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#42:1>
It is easy, therefore, to understand why congested traffic can lead
to headaches and dizziness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#43:1>
Sulfur Oxides are primarily SO <sb> 2 </sb> and SO <sb> 3 </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#44:1>
They are derived mostly from stationary sources like power plants and
industries, by burning of fossil fuels.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#45:1>
Sulfur oxides in the atmosphere produce deleterious effects on
vegetation, materials, and men.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#46:1>
Leaves of affected plants showed a splotchy bleaching pattern.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#47:1>
Also, SO <sb> 2 </sb> dissolves to form H <sb> 2 </sb> SO < sb> 3
</sb> and SO <sb> 3 </sb> to form H <sb> 2 </sb> SO <sb> 4 </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#48:1>
These suspended acids are washed out during the first rain and causes
acid rains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#49:1>
Acid rains can corrode metals, and attack nylon and other fabrics.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#50:1>
They also affect plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#51:1>
Limestone and marble are also susceptible to acid attacks.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#52:1>
SO <sb> 2 </sb> acts as an irritant and is known to increase symptoms
in patients with bronchitis, emphysema and other lung diseases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#53:1>
Hydrocarbons are mostly derived from incomplete combustion or
partial oxidation of fuel in motor vehicles in urban areas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#54:1>
Forest and vegetation also emit various HC in their normal biological
processes--for example, bacterial decomposition of organic matter produces
methane gas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#55:1>
Man also emits HC into the atmosphere by allowing the evaporation of
industrial solvents and the processing and usage of petroleum.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#56:1>
Because of the wide variety of HC emitted, it is difficult to
generalize their effects.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#57:1>
However, reactive HC plays an important part in smog formation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#58:1>
Also, certain HC like benzo-a-pyrene has been linked to cancer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#59:1>
Particulates are complex acids and liquids found in our
atmosphere.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#60:1>
They enter the atmosphere through natural emissions like volcanic
eruptions or through man-made processes in industries like grinding and
spraying, fly ash from combustion processes and from automobiles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#61:1>
Of all the toxic metals found in the air, lead is present in the
biggest concentration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#62:1>
It comes from the burning of gasoline where it is added as an
anti-knock agent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#63:1>
Oxides of nitrogen, generally referred to as Nox, are generated
mainly by automobiles and electric power plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#64:1>
The most significant environmental effect of Nox emission is its role
in smog formation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#65:1>
Nitrogen dioxides and nitric oxide are known to cause fading in
acetate, cotton and rayon fibers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#66:1>
The yellowing of white fabrics has been shown to occur in the
presence of Nox.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#67:1>
Nitric oxide is not an irritant, and its main toxic potential results
from its oxidation to NO <sb> 2 </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#68:1>
Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant to the eyes and the respiratory
tract. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#69:1>
In Table 2, five major pollutants are identified.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#70:1>
They are carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, particulates,
and nitrogen oxides. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#71:1>
Lastly, the total effect in terms of health, aesthetics and
economic damage of the pollutants that enter the air is greater than the sum
of all the gaseous, liquid or solid pollutants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#72:1>
The troposphere acts as a large reaction vessel in which a complex
series of chemical reactions takes place, aided by the energy of the sun.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#73:1>
This interaction of hydrocarbons, oxide of nitrogen and oxygen in the
presence of the sun 's ultraviolet light produces photochemical smog, which
is an even greater problem in big cities. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#74:1>
<h> <bold> AIR POLLUTION IN METRO MANILA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#75:1>
Metro Manila, which is the busiest and most thickly populated
part of the Philippines, is not spared from the ever-growing problem of air
pollution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#76:1>
Table 3 shows the population of Metro Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#77:1>
The existence of polluted air in Metro Manila is observed not only on
the busy streets but also in residential homes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#78:1>
Dust normally settles all over the house.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#79:1>
Housewives find it difficult to do the cleaning many times a day.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#80:1>
With the recent eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, not only is dust obvious
but abundant ash falls has caused many homeowners and building establishments
to clear their roofs and yards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#81:1>
During rush hours, the city 's main streets look hazy from the
emissions of poorly maintained motor vehicles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#82:1>
These include not only <indig> jeepneys </indig> and buses but even
privately owned cars stalled in congested traffic.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#83:1>
It is also a common thing to see people covering their noses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#84:1>
<indig> Jeepneys </indig> and bus drivers find that their towels
become black due to smoke and dust. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#85:1>
The roofs of residential houses located near industrial
establishments are often replaced due to acid rainfall which causes metallic
corrosion.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#86:1>
All these and more are obvious causes for us to become aware of the
condition of our atmosphere and come up with proper monitoring systems and
control measures to keep the surrounding air clean. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#87:1>
<h> <bold> SOURCES OF AIR CONTAMINANTS IN METRO MANILA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#88:1>
The major sources of CO and hydrocarbons are motor vehicles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#89:1>
In Metro Manila, the number of motor vehicles registered with the
Land Transportation Office in 1990 increased by 16.41% over the 1989 total.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#90:1>
Of the total 648,778 motor vehicles, 16% are new and 84% are renewed
registration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#91:1>
Table 4 shows the type of motor vehicles with new registration and
renewed registration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#92:1>
LTO data also shows that 73.4% of these vehicles are gasoline fed
and 25.2% are diesel fed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#93:1>
Trailers are not fueled. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#94:1>
Table 5 shows that gasoline fed vehicles contribute to CO and
total organic gas emissions while diesel fed vehicles account for particulate
matter, SOx and NOx emission. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#95:1>
Other sources of air pollution in Metro Manila are power plants
and industrial firms.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#96:1>
They are called stationary sources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#97:1>
Table 6 gives an estimate of air pollution emission from stationary
sources by area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#98:1>
From this table, Valenzuela is highly polluted, followed by
Para&ntilde;aque.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#99:1>
This is so because most of the industrial firms and power plants are
located in these areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#100:1>
It can also be seen in Table 7 that mobile sources account for
most PM, CO, NOx and TOG emissions, while electric generating plants are
culprits for SOx emissions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#101:1>
<h> <bold> AIR QUALITY MONITORING IN METRO MANILA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#102:1>
During the past 15 years, air quality monitoring in Metro Manila
has been along major thoroughfares, so information or data gathered are
traffic-related situations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#103:1>
During the seventies, stations were established in Cubao, Quiapo,
Pasay and Ermita.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#104:1>
In 1985, some of these stations were abandoned and new ones using
different methods of sampling and analysis were established.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#105:1>
These are shown in Figure 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#106:1>
In order to protect public health and welfare and to reduce
property damage, the NPCC set the following maximum limiting levels shown in
Table 8.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#107:1>
The maximum air quality standards of other specific pollutants are
given in Table 9. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#108:1>
Data gathered by the NPCC showed the effect of exhausts from
motor vehicles in the metropolis from 1975 to 1983.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#109:1>
Additional data were gathered from 1987 to 1990 at the different
monitoring stations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#110:1>
These data are plotted in Figures 2 to 4 to show the level of air
pollution in Metro Manila. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#111:1>
<h> <bold> AIR POLLUTION LEVELS IN METRO MANILA </bold> </h>

<p> 1.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#112:1>
<h> Carbon Monoxide: </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#113:1>
Figure 2 shows the Quiapo area to be most polluted among the 4
monitoring stations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#114:1>
This is due to heavy traffic and congestion, since so much passenger
jeepneys and buses ply the area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#115:1>
Also when traffic density reaches the point where vehicles
repeatedly stop and start, emissions increase sharply ( Brockris 1977). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#116:1>
Quiapo is followed by the Ermita area, Cubao area, and lastly,
by Pasay.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#117:1>
This trend is shown in the late seventies and early eighties due to
business activities in the locality.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#118:1>
Since business establishments are found in these localities, traffic
congestion is naturally expected and causes high CO emissions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#119:1>
Today, CO concentration in these areas may have changed due to
changes in traffic conditions and business activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#120:1>
But the trend shows increasing CO levels in all areas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#121:1>
This may be expected due to more vehicles which are not properly
maintained. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#122:1>
This is expected to be the same trend for TOG, PM, and NOx. </p>

<p> 2.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#123:1>
<h> Sulfur Dioxide: </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#124:1>
Figures 3a and 3b show the trend of SO2 levels in different
monitoring stations in Metro Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#125:1>
From 1981 to 1983, unreliable readings were expected due to a
gradual breakdown of equipment ( DENR).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#126:1>
By 1986, the measurement method was changed from acidimetry to
colorimetric, resulting in lower SO2 levels measured. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#127:1>
All levels measured are below the standard of 0.14 ppm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#128:1>
In areas like Ermita and Quezon City, SO2 levels are decreasing, but
in areas like Valenzuela, Para&ntilde;aque and Pasig, the level of SO2 is
increasing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#129:1>
These areas are places where power plants and many industrial
establishments are found. </p>

<p> 3.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#130:1>
<h> Total Suspended Particulates: </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#131:1>
TSP levels in all areas exceeded 180 ug/scm, which is the standard,
as shown in Figures 4a and 4b.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#132:1>
Pasig, Ermita, Malabon, Valenzuela and Quezon City are the worst
areas in terms of TSP.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#133:1>
Table 10 gives us the 1987 annual arithmetic mean of hourly
average concentrations of various pollutants in Metro Manila in
micrograms/m3. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#134:1>
As shown in Table 10, Valenzuela has the highest concentration
of lead, followed by Malabon.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#135:1>
Quezon City has the highest copper concentration followed by Pasig.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#136:1>
Iron and zinc are the highest in Pasay and Ermita.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-035#137:1>
Based on these quantities, high levels of heavy metals are found in
at least two stations: Valenzuela and Malabon. </p> </I>
