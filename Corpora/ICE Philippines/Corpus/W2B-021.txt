<h> <bold> Meet the Dengue Mosquito </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#3:1>
PRETTY, fresh, sweet, innocent, that vase of flowers on the side
table in your living room looks like a perfect subject for a still-life.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#4:1>
But inside the flower vase half-filled with water lurks an evil gang
that not even the combined forces of the police, military, and the
Presidential Task Force Against Organized Crime can wipe out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#5:1>
The &ldquo; gang &rdquo; has so far killed more than 200 Filipinos
this year, most of them helpless children. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#6:1>
It thrives in the seemingly clean water that accumulates in
containers like your harmless-looking flower vase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#7:1>
Floating on top of the stagnant water are about 60-100 eggs of a
single <foreign> <it> Aedes </it> </foreign> mosquito.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#8:1>
They hatch into larvae, or wrigglers, which after a week turn into
round pupae for one or two days.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#9:1>
And then they become adult mosquitoes that are capable of transmitting
the deadly dengue virus. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#10:1>
These mosquitoes prefer to breed in dark places, preferring red
and black backgrounds rather than those of lighter shades. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#11:1>
Inside homes, the <foreign> Aedes </foreign> eggs can be found in
earthen jars used for storing water, ant traps for protecting food cabinets
in kitchens, concrete tanks and metal drums and plastic containers for
holding water, saucers for holding ornamental potted plants, soft drink
bottles, water trays of refrigerators with automatic defrosting, air
conditioner trays, and other containers where water stays for up to seven
days--such as flower vases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#12:1>
Main outdoor breeding sites for <foreign> Aedes </foreign>
mosquitoes are holes in trees, bamboo stumps, leaf crevices, earthen jars,
discarded bottles and tins, discarded tires, metal drums, barrels for
collecting rainwater, clogged roof gutters, coconut shells and husks, latex
collection cups in rubber plantations, <foreign> bancas </foreign> and small
fishing boats. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#13:1>
<h> <bold> Unsinkable eggs </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#14:1>
One alarming fact about <foreign> Aedes </foreign> mosquito eggs
is that they can survive for up to six months even when their breeding sites
go dry under natural conditions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#15:1>
Some of them hatch when the containers become filled with water
again.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#16:1>
And when the site dries up again and then gets flooded with water
again, the remaining unhatched eggs from the same batch could still hatch.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#17:1>
The <foreign> Aedes </foreign> mosquito is sometimes called the
tiger mosquito because of its peculiar white stripes--one type has one
stripe, another has two--on its legs and back.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#18:1>
The mosquitoes are quite small, compared to other species, and
measure only 5 mm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#19:1>
They are usually found about 50 meters from their breeding sites
but can travel up to 200 meters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#20:1>
More <foreign> Aedes </foreign> mosquitoes are found indoors than
outdoors.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#21:1>
The <foreign> <it> Aedes aegypti </it> </foreign> type prefer to rest
in shaded places indoors, while <foreign> <it> Aedes albopictus </it>
</foreign> prefer to rest outdoors, in shrubs and trees. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#22:1>
<h> <bold> Biting females </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#23:1>
Like other mosquito species, only the female <foreign> Aedes
</foreign> bite. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#24:1>
The adult female <foreign> Aedes </foreign> mates and takes its
first blood meal about 48 hours after coming out of its pupa stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#25:1>
It can bite several people, depending on how much blood it sucks.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#26:1>
To lay eggs, it has to be engorged with blood, which may take two
to five days.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#27:1>
Each <foreign> Aedes </foreign> female can lay up to four batches of
eggs during its life cycle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#28:1>
The male <foreign> Aedes </foreign> survives an average of 20
days, the female 30 days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#29:1>
<foreign> Aedes </foreign> mosquitoes are day-biters with peak
biting activities at dawn, after sunrise, and before sunset.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#30:1>
They also bite during other times of the day and at night, although
at a very low density level. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#31:1>
<h> <bold> Virus carriers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#32:1>
What people should keep in mind is that these mosquitoes become
dengue carriers only after they have bitten a person infected with dengue.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#33:1>
It takes about eight to 10 days for the virus to multiply in the
female mosquito 's salivary gland before the insect can transmit the virus to
a human. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#34:1>
A person bitten by a dengue-carrying mosquito does not
immediately show symptoms of dengue fever.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#35:1>
It takes from five to seven days for the virus to incubate in the
human body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#36:1>
Dengue fever is not directly transmitted from person to person.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#37:1>
It is usually just like flu and rarely causes death, but can
develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#38:1>
In the latter form, the patient can bleed to death. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#39:1>
<h> <bold> Symptoms </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#40:1>
Dengue fever is characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever
lasting from three to five days, severe headache, pain behind the eyes,
muscle and joint pains, nausea and vomiting, and a measles-like rash on the
chest and upper limbs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#41:1>
These characteristics vary according to the age and general
health of the patient.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#42:1>
This is why the Department of Health is advising people to
immediately see a doctor if they suspect they have dengue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#43:1>
It is up to the doctor to determine whether the patient should be
hospitalized or could be treated at home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#44:1>
The high fever should be treated by sponging and appropriate use
of paracetamol.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#45:1>
Aspirin should not be given because it may lead to bleeding and cause
gastric irritation and acidosis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#46:1>
Oral rehydration must be attempted in the early stages of fever
to replace lost body fluids.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#47:1>
The sugar and salt solution used for diarrheal diseases--like oresol
and commercially available preparations--can be given in repeated small
quantities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#48:1>
Fruit juice is preferable to plain water. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#49:1>
<h> <bold> Fatal stage </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#50:1>
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is the fatal stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#51:1>
It is characterized by high continuous fever lasting two to seven
days that may be accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain and subsequent evidence of bleeding like persistent red spots on the
skin, nose or gum bleeding, coffee-ground vomit, and dark stools. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#52:1>
The patient can go into shock. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#53:1>
The DOH is advising parents to watch for these danger signs:
restlessness, cold clammy skin, sudden abdominal pain, difficulty in
breathing, and behavioral change. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#54:1>
If any of these symptoms are present, the patient must
immediately be brought to a hospital. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#55:1>
Not all dengue fever cases require intravenous fluids or blood
transfusion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#56:1>
Doctors are in the best position to determine when the patient needs
these. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#57:1>
The DOH has warned that a person who gets infected with dengue
today is not assured of immunity later.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#58:1>
This is because four dengue strains--Types 2, 3, and 4--are currently
circulating in the county. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#59:1>
Infection with one strain gives a person only three months '
immunity from the other strains. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#60:1>
<h> <bold> More serious </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#61:1>
According to San Lazaro Hospital chief epidemiologist Dr. Eric
Tayag, getting infected with a second and subsequent dengue strain results in
a more serious illness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#62:1>
This is because the second dengue strain replicates itself after
detecting a person 's antibodies to the initial strain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#63:1>
The best way to prevent the spread of dengue is to keep one 's
environment clean, especially the areas that can become <foreign> Aedes
</foreign> breeding places. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#64:1>
This means, among other steps, discarding water in open
containers and replacing water in flower vases every week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#65:1>
Insect repellents like lotions can also be used but the DOH warns
that these ward off mosquitoes only for a few hours and must therefore be
applied regularly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#66:1>
Mosquito nets can be treated with pyrethroid insecticide to
prevent <foreign> Aedes </foreign> bites at night.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#67:1>
Mosquito coils can be used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#68:1>
Fogging is not usually recommended, except in schools and areas
where there is an epidemic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#69:1>
The fogging insecticide only kills the adult mosquito while leaving
million of larvae untouched.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#70:1>
Mosquitoes may also develop resistance to the insecticide. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Verdict 's out: Viagra is good for Asians too </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#72:2>
<bold> Stella O. Gonzalez </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#73:2>
SINGAPORE - -

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#74:2>
The results are out and the verdict is much the same as earlier
clinical trials conducted on American men: Viagra is an effective,
well-tolerated drug treatment for impotent Asian men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#75:2>
Now it 's up to Asian governments to decide whether they will
allow the sale of the ballyhooed drug in their countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#76:2>
A report made yesterday during the 4th Asian Congress on Urology
at the Raffles City Convention Center here said 86 percent of 127 erectile
dysfunction patients from the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia who
participated in the trial reported improvement in erection after 12 weeks.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#77:2>
A similar test, this time on 130 patients from Hong Kong,
Indonesia and Thailand, reported 81 percent improved erections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#78:2>
Viagra, manufactured by Pfizer, has been approved for sale in
Thailand and Australia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#79:2>
Among other countries awaiting approval from local regulation
agencies are Japan and those who conducted the Asian clinical trials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#80:2>
It has been estimated that 3.5 million Filipino men are suffering
from erectile dysfunction.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#81:2>
In Asia, one in two men over 40 years old suffer from it and nearly
half of the sufferers have a specific underlying physical cause.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#82:2>
The average age of the impotent Asian man is 46 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#83:2>
The worldwide estimate is 100 million impotent men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#84:2>
The Asian Sildenafil Efficacy and Safety Study ( ASSESS) by
Viagra ( generic name: Sildenafil) manufacturer Pfizer used 690 patients from
the six countries mentioned above plus Taiwan, where testing is ongoing. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#85:2>
<h> <bold> <mention> ASSESS </mention> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#86:2>
Participants were all Asians, aged 18 years or older, were
clinically diagnosed to have erectile dysfunction, are not receiving any
other treatment for ED, and have a stable relationship with a female partner.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#87:2>
They were grouped into two--one taking Viagra ( not more than
once daily) one hour before sexual intercourse, the other a placebo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#88:2>
It was a randomized, double-blind test where even the doctors who
gave the medicine did not know who received Viagra and who got the placebo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#89:2>
The results from the Asian countries were turned over to Pfizer 's
central research group in new York. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#90:2>
<mention> ASSESS-1 </mention> included the Philippines, Singapore
and Malaysia while <mention> ASSESS-2 </mention> covered Hong Kong, Indonesia
and Thailand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#91:2>
In the Philippines, 67 patients took the placebo and 66 Viagra.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#92:2>
Individual results of the Philippine clinical trial conducted by
Doctors Benjamin Mendoza, Reynaldo de la Cruz, Telesforo Gana and German Jose
Albano are not known.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#93:2>
They have been incorporated into the results of <mention> ASSESS-1
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#94:2>
Of the 127 patients in <mention> ASSESS-1 </mention> who took
Viagra, 86 percent reported improved erections while 33 percent who took
placebo also reported an improvement.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#95:2>
Of the 130 patients in <mention> ASSESS-2 </mention> who took Viagra,
81 percent reported improved erections while 28 percent in the placebo group
reported an improvement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#96:2>
In <mention> ASSESS-1 </mention> , there was a 74-percent success
at attempted sexual intercourse among Viagra users; in <mention> ASSESS-2
</mention> , 68 percent. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#97:2>
<h> <bold> Common side effects </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#98:2>
There was no reported incident of a heart attack or stroke among
those who took Viagra.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#99:2>
One patient receiving Viagra experienced severe <foreign> angina
pectoris </foreign> which was not considered to be related to the treatment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#100:2>
One placebo patient suffered an accidental injury to the hand.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#101:2>
( Clinical trial protocol requires the reporting of all ailments
even if these are not related to the drug-taking). </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#102:3>
<h> <bold> Aspirin: The centennial drug </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#103:3>
<bold> Tyrone Reyes </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#104:3>
Aspirin is one of those things in our lives that seems to have
been with us for as far as we can remember.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#105:3>
In fact, when a Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey gave
1,000 people a list of inventions and asked them to name the ones they
<quote> &ldquo; couldn't live without," </quote> the fifth-place finisher - -
behind the automobile, light bulb, telephone, and television - - was aspirin!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#106:3>
Indeed, aspirin has served humanity well for 100 years now.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#107:3>
It has become the most widely taken drug in the world today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#108:3>
Used initially as a pain reliever and fever reducer, aspirin has
proven itself to be a lifesaver too - - an inexpensive and powerful defense
against heart attacks, strokes, and even some forms of cancer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#109:3>
In today 's column, we 'll look into aspirin 's effectiveness
against heart attack and strokes, and help you decide whether aspirin therapy
might be right for you. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#110:3>
<h> <bold> Healthy heart </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#111:3>
The strongest evidence of aspirin 's effectiveness against major
disorders comes from studies on heart attacks - - which occur when a blood
clot blocks an artery nourishing a portion of the heart muscle.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#112:3>
By inhibiting the clotting process, aspirin helps prevent these
attacks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#113:3>
Aspirin 's heart-protecting abilities were proven in 1988 with the
reported results of a huge intervention trial, the Physician 's Health Study,
which aimed to determine whether aspirin could stave off first heart attacks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#114:3>
The Harvard researchers randomly assigned some 22,000 male
physicians, aged 40 to 48, to take an ordinary 325 mg. aspirin tablet or a
placebo every other day.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#115:3>
Neither the men nor the researchers knew which they were taking.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#116:3>
Midway through the trial, monitors spotted a striking development:
44 per cent fewer heart attacks in the aspirin group!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#117:3>
The findings were so convincing, the researchers halted the aspirin
arm of the study early so those taking the placebo pills wouldn't be deprived
of the possible benefit.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#118:3>
That study, and others that came after, established aspirin as
essential therapy for most men and women who are at risk for a heart attack
or who have already had one. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#119:3>
In addition to its preventive value, aspirin has also been shown
to help <it> treat </it> a heart attack, if taken promptly in response to
symptoms.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#120:3>
The Second International Study of Infarct Survival found taking
aspirin within 24 hours of the onset of a heart attack and then daily for the
next month reduced the death rate in both men and women by 25 per cent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#121:3>
Anyone with heart attack symptoms - - chest pain that radiates to
the jaw, neck, back, shoulder, or arm, or that 's accompanied by
lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, or shortness of breath - - should call for
medical help immediately, then take a regular 325 mg. aspirin tablet, even if
he or she is already on aspirin regimen. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#122:3>
<h> <bold> Brain protector </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#123:3>
The evidence of aspirin 's benefit against stroke is clearest
for people who have already had a stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA),
a stroke-like episode causing symptoms that resolve fully within 24 hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#124:3>
Those people are at increased risk for subsequent strokes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#125:3>
A landmark 1994 review of 145 randomized, controlled trials
involving more than 100,000 people concluded that aspirin cuts that risk by
about 25 per cent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#126:3>
Some experts feel that aspirin 's anti-clotting could increase
the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, caused by bleeding from a burst blood vessel
in the brain.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#127:3>
That sort of stroke is much less common than ischemic, or
clot-related, strokes, but more deadly.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#128:3>
And the 1994 review did hint at a possible trend toward more
hemorrhagic strokes in aspirin users.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#129:3>
However, any increase in that risk is far outweighed by a reduction
in non-hemorrhagic strokes and heart attacks among high-risk people. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#130:3>
<h> <bold> The aspirin prescription </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#131:3>
There 's more than enough evidence for people who are at risk
for a heart attack or stroke to consider going on aspirin.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#132:3>
You may be a candidate if you:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#133:3>
* Already have coronary artery disease.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#134:3>
( That includes having had a previous heart attack.)

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#135:3>
* Have reduced blood flow through one of the carotid arteries in the
neck.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#136:3>
* Have had an ischemic stroke or a transient ischemic cerebral
attack.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#137:3>
* Are a post menopausal woman under age 60 or so with two or more of
the following risk factors for cardiovascular disease, or an older woman or a
man over 50 with even one of these risk factors: smoking or steady exposure
to second-hand smoke, hypertension, diabetes, high LDL cholesterol or low HDL
cholesterol, severe obesity, heavy alcohol consumption, a family history of
early coronary disease ( before age 55) or of ischemic stroke, or a sedentary
lifestyle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#138:3>
The recommended dosage ranges widely.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#139:3>
A daily dose of 81 mg. may be best.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#140:3>
The so-called <mention> &ldquo; baby aspirin &rdquo; </mention> ( or
Aspilet) has exactly 80 mg. per tablet so this would appear to be sufficient
for this purpose.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#141:3>
It 's possible that people at high risk for stroke - - those who
have had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack - - might benefit
more from a higher daily dose of 325 mg., since the trials that found a
stroke benefit so far have used similar dosages. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#142:3>
<h> <bold> Aspirin precautions </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#143:3>
While aspirin has substantial benefits, it also has significant
risks.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#144:3>
The most common side effect is upper abdominal discomfort - -
stomach pain, indigestion, or heart burn.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#145:3>
Bleeding in the stomach is a less frequent but more dangerous
possibility.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#146:3>
Enteric-coated aspirin ( Ecotrin), which dissolves in the small
intestine rather than the stomach, may help forestall those problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#147:3>
And it helps to take the pills - - enteric-coated or not - - after
meals with a full glass of water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#148:3>
Still, the possible adverse effects make it essential to discuss
aspirin therapy with your physician before you begin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#149:3>
Any of the following factors in particular may rule out an
aspirin regimen:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#150:3>
* A bleeding disorder.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#151:3>
* Regular use of an anticoagulant, such as warfarin ( Coumadin) or
ticlopidine ( Ticlid).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#152:3>
* A history of stomach ulcers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-021#153:3>
