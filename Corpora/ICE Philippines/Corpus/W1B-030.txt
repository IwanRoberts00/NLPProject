Dear Prof. Cruz:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#9:1>
Following our conversation, I am herewith transmitting material on
the forthcoming World Conference on Higher Education ( " Higher Education in
the Twenty-first Century: Vision and Action") scheduled to be held in Paris
on October 5-9, 1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#10:1>
The NCCA has been invited by the Department of Foreign Affairs (
UNESCO National Commission) to be on the Philippine delegation to ensure that
the views of the culture and arts sector are properly presented in the
Philippine position.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#11:1>
I am happy that you will be available to represent the NCCA on the
delegation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#12:1>
I shall submit a proposal to the Commission at its next meeting,
regarding your official designation as NCCA representative.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#13:1>
I understand that the Secretary of Foreign Affairs will make the
necessary representations to Malaca&ntidle;ang for the composition of the
delegation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#14:1>
At the first preparatory meeting held earlier today ( chaired by
CHED Commissioner Mona D. Valisno), the group identified the following topics
as appropriately including NCCA inputs ( see enclosed paper entitled &ldquo;
Higher Education in the Twenty-first Century - Vision and Action"):

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#15:1>
<h> <bold> Themes of the World Conference on Higher Education </bold>
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#16:1>
Theme 1: The Pertinence of Higher Education

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#17:1>
- Higher education, social development and peace

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#18:1>
- Higher education and partnerships with the world of work ( note:
with reference to the so-called culture industries)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#19:1>
Theme 2: The Quality of Higher Education

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#20:1>
- Innovation in higher education curricula and teaching methods

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#21:1>
- Higher education and the promotion of cultural identity

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#22:1>
<h> <bold> Thematic Debates: </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#23:1>
Higher education, culture and society

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#24:1>
- Promoting a culture of peace

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#25:1>
- Mobilizing the power of culture </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#26:1>
It was agreed that the NCCA representative will prepare a 2-3
page paper that would cover the following for each topic: ( a) issues or
problems and ( b) recommendations on policy, programs or projects ( that can
in turn be worldwide, regional, national, or institutional).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#27:1>
The NCAA inputs shall be combined with those of other agencies and
the resulting draft would be the Philippine intervention on the topic
concerned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#28:1>
The deadline for the paper is August 19 ( to be submitted to the
UNESCO National Commission Secretariat), in anticipation of the next
delegation meeting scheduled on August 21, tentatively at the DFA at 11:00
o'clock a.m. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#29:1>
Many thanks for agreeing to help out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#30:1>
With kind regards. </p>

Dear Dr. Cruz:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#48:2>
In behalf of the NCCA Board of Commissioners, may I invite you to
be a member of the Special Committee that we are constituting for 1998, to
evaluate applications for the new NCCA Competitive Grants Programs for
Culture and Arts Exhibits and for Publication.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#49:2>
The program for Publication is intended for the development of
self-sustaining publications and audio-visual materials on Filipino cultural
heritage and artistic expression.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#50:2>
On the other hand, the program for Culture and Arts Exhibits shall
assist cultural institutions in the design and mounting of exhibits
illuminating aspects of Philippine culture and arts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#51:2>
Grants from the National Endowment Fund for Culture and Arts
under R. A. No. 7356 have in the past been made on recommendation of the
Committees concerned.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#52:2>
Each committee had a budget and grants were processed as received,
being evaluated in the light of the Committee 's approved program and other
activities for the year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#53:2>
The new competitive grants program ( described in the attached
Proponent 's Guide to NCCA Grants Programs) are in addition to
Committee-based grants and has the aim of reaching talented artists who may
otherwise be outside the NCCA Committee network.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#54:2>
Special Evaluation Committees are being constituted from among
recognized artists, including those who may otherwise not be available to
work with the NCCA.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#55:2>
The first set of applications ( those received as of June 15) are the
ones that we propose to submit to the Special Committee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#56:2>
We are hoping that you will join us in this undertaking which
would involve possibly one or two meetings at most, so that the NCCA
community can benefit from your experience.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#57:2>
We would also be very interested in your suggestions on how to
further encourage artists, through the NCCA Grants Program.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#58:2>
Subject to the availability of the Committee members, we propose to
hold the Committee 's meeting at 10:00 a.m. through lunch on Wednesday, July
8 at the NCCA Board Room. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#59:2>
With kind regards. </p>

Dear <bold> Dr. Cruz </bold> :

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#74:3>
We are pleased to submit the data required by the Commission on
Higher Education ( CHED) to support our claim for the U. P. College of Arts
and Letters as worthy of consideration as a Center of Excellence for
Literature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#75:3>
You will note that the lists of awards, publications and
researches of our faculty and students include only the more recent ones.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#76:3>
We had to do this due to time constraint.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#77:3>
If you need more comprehensive lists, do give us more time to collate
the data. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#78:3>
You will also note that we did not consider the items under
Administration on the level of accreditation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#79:3>
We have never submitted our programs for accreditation because of the
following reasons:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#80:3>
1. the University of the Philippines is the oldest State University
with its own charter;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#81:3>
2. our degree programs, having been instituted ahead of those from
other State Universities and Colleges, continue to serve as models for them;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#82:3>
3. majority of our programs [ <foreign> e.g. </foreign> Ph.D. English
Studies ( Creative Writing), Ph.D. Hispanic Literature, M.A. <indig>
Malikhaing Pagsulat </indig> ] are not offered in other State Universities
and Colleges. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#83:3>
We request you, therefore, not to apply the criteria on
accreditation to us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#84:3>
In closing, we wish to reiterate our confidence that the College
of Arts and Letters will live up to the expectations of a Center of
Excellence. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#98:4>
Dear <bold> Dr. Sarile </bold> :

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#99:4>
It is my pleasure to submit the data required by the Commission
on Higher Education ( CHED) to support the bid of the Department of English
and Comparative Literature, College of Arts and Letters, to become a Center
of Excellence in English. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#100:4>
The documentation is partial because we failed to receive the
notification about the competition early enough.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#101:4>
However, given more time, we should be able to submit the complete
data. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#102:4>
The English Studies Program of the DECL is one of its kind in
the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#103:4>
The term <mention> &ldquo; studies &rdquo; </mention> signals a
conceptual shift from English as a unidisciplinary field to English as an
interdisciplinary area of study.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#104:4>
The program 's focus continues to be the English Language but it
builds on an interdisciplinary curriculum which enables each student to
relate language study to literature and culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#105:4>
This orientation is reflected in many of the courses which we
offer to our students.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#106:4>
<mention> &ldquo; English for the Professions, &rdquo; </mention>
for example, explores the different ways English may be used in the workplace
in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#107:4>
<mention> &ldquo; Levels of English Language Use &rdquo; </mention>
examines the various registers of English in the country and in the world.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#108:4>
Our faculty are likewise the first to introduce Critical
Linguistics, Critical Discourse Analysis and other related fields which build
on an interplay of Language, Literary Theory and Critical Practice.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#109:4>
All English Studies majors are given adequate background in
Literature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#110:4>
With these unique features of the program and a strong faculty
in teaching, research, and community service, I am confident that the
Department of English and Comparative Literature, College of Arts and
Letters, shall be deemed worthy to be a Center of Excellence in English. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#127:5>
Dear Dr. Sarile:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#128:5>
I am very pleased to submit the complete report of the
Department of English and Comparative Literature, College of Arts and Letters
( DECL, CAL) in connection with its bid to be the Center of Excellence in the
English Language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#129:5>
The DECL staff has meticulously compiled data to quantify the
criteria on the COE.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#130:5>
But since final evaluation, after all, will have to consider
qualitative grounds, I should like to highlight some strengths of our English
Language program.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#131:5>
These are:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#132:5>
1. Its curricular program

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#133:5>
Only the DECL has a full-blown English Studies: Language program
which includes the B.A., M.A., and Ph. D. levels.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#134:5>
It is the only program with a B.A. in English Studies thus providing
a solid undergraduate matrix for its graduate offerings. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#135:5>
2. The integration of curricular and extra-curricular programs
within one structure, not disparate ones.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#136:5>
Combined under one wing are the Intensive English Program for
foreigners, the Summer Institute for Teachers of Language and Literature, the
Extension Programs on Professional Communication, and the three-tiered
curricular program on English Studies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#137:5>
This structure makes possible a sharing of vision and resources
through a mutually enriching arrangement. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#138:5>
3. A large enrolment in, and turnout of graduates from all three
levels of the English Studies Program ( please see figures in the attached
report).

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#139:5>
In this respect, the DECL has had a strong impact on English
language education and English related professions such as law, advertising,
mass communication, human resource development, foreign service, tourism,
<foreign> etc. </foreign> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#140:5>
4. Its interdisciplinary orientation, thus challenging traditional
borders of the discipline.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#141:5>
The curriculum provides solid background in the sub-fields of
linguistics and the various approaches to it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#142:5>
It has, however, opened itself up to other disciplines by providing
for electives.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#143:5>
The faculty have also introduced Critical Discourse Analysis and
other related fields which build on an interplay of Language, Literary Theory
and Critical Practice.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#144:5>
All English Studies majors are given adequate background in
Literature.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#145:5>
Thus, the faculty 's research and publications in language,
literature and culture dovetails with this interdisciplinary perspective.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#146:5>
5. Its Distance Education Component

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#147:5>
The DECL faculty have designed distance education modules for
<mention> &ldquo; Problems in Rhetoric &rdquo; </mention> , a course towards
the M.A. in Language Studies ( Distance Education Mode) and for Communication
I and Communication II ( Freshman English).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#148:5>
The Distance Education program explores alternative approaches to
teaching the English Language; likewise, it widens access to English Language
Studies in the Philippines. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#149:5>
6. The solid qualifications of its faculty and the University 's
continuing faculty development programs

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#150:5>
No other Department of English can match the number of Ph.D. and
M.A. degree holders in the DECL and the junior faculty with M.A. units.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#151:5>
Almost all have been productive in terms of research and
publications.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#152:5>
The faculty have been exposed to centers of knowledge in various
parts of the world. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#153:5>
7. Its valuable service to a large General Education English Program
( G.E.).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#154:5>
The DECL services between 2,500 to 3,000 through its regular G.E.
course offerings and through the ancillary services of the Language
Laboratory, the Learning Resource Center and the Audio-Visual Rooms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#155:5>
With these distinctive features and quality involvement in the
spheres of teaching, research and extension I am confident the Department of
English and Comparative Literature, College of Arts and Letters shall be
deemed worthy to be the Center of Excellence in the English Language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-030#156:5>
Thank you. </p>
