<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#3:1>
IAN Hay, a plant hobbyist focusing on weird and unusual plants, is
probably one of the happiest persons in the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#4:1>
This bachelor from Australia, who was with Asian Development Bank here
for about 18 years, also collects orchids, <foreign> bonsai </foreign> ,
bromeliads and other ornamentals, apart from cacti and other succulents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#5:1>
An active member of the Cactus and Succulent Society of the
Philippines which this writer founded in 1978 and is now headed by Mely Ileto
Sibayan, he has a most impressive collection--succulents ranging from cacti,
<foreign> euphorbias </foreign> , some <foreign> crassulas </foreign> to the
succulent members of the <foreign> Apocynaceae </foreign> , <foreign>
Asclepiadaceae </foreign> , <foreign> Compositae </foreign> , <foreign>
Liliaceae </foreign> and <foreign> Portulacariaceae </foreign> families among
others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#6:1>
One of the unusual succulents is the <foreign> <it> Monedenium
guentherii var. mammillarii </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#7:1>
Belonging to the <foreign> Euphorbiaceae </foreign> family, this plant
originated in the arid regions of M'balu mountains in East Africa.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#8:1>
It bears few oblanceolate leaves around the apex and fall off in about
a month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#9:1>
Its manner of growth is prostrate--it crawls and eventually
becomes pendulous.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#10:1>
Although the plants remind you of large worms, to the plant
collectors, they look very fascinating. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#11:1>
Other favorites of Ian are the crested forms.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#12:1>
Crestation is a result of mutation or sport, showing something
different from the normal or original.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#13:1>
The change in form, say from a normal columnar to a shape like that
of a rooster 's crown or crest ( cockscomb), the mutation is called <mention>
crestate </mention> or <mention> crestation </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#14:1>
It looks weird like a pile of bloated and curling worms but to
avid collectors it 's a form of art which they enjoy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#15:1>
Some of Mr. Hay 's specimens were the <foreign> <it> Notocactus
scopa cristata </it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it> Mammillaria vaupelii
cristata </it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it> Mammillaria elonzata cristata
</it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it> Chamaecereus silvestrii crassicaulis
cristatus </it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it> Nyctocereus serpentinus cristatus
</it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it> Opuntia vestita cristata </it> </foreign> ,
<foreign> <it> Cephalocereus chrysacanthus cristatus </it> </foreign> and
some varieties of <foreign> euphorbias </foreign> such as the <foreign> <it>
E. neriifolia cristata, E. lactea cristata variegata, E. nerrifolia cristata
variegata </it> </foreign> , among others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#16:1>
The other forms of mutations are the variegations and
monstrosities.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#17:1>
Plants showing discoloration or pigmentaton, meaning having white or
yellow spots or splashes is termed <mention> variegation </mention> and
plants deviating from its normal form as to size and irregularity but not
crestate, are considered monstrous. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#18:1>
Monstrous and variegated forms are curiosities that cacti and
succulent hobbyists like to collect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#19:1>
<foreign> Caudiciforms </foreign> are also Ian Hay 's weaknesses.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#20:1>
These are plants with enlarged bases, usually rounded, including both
stem and root called <mention> caudex </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#21:1>
Among his caudiciform collections are some types of <foreign>
Jatrophas </foreign> called <mention> gout plants </mention> , <foreign>
Dorstenias </foreign> and <foreign> Beaucarnea recurvata </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#22:1>
The <indig> <it> gabi </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> ubi </it>
</indig> are some examples of caudiciforms.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#23:1>
These plants, however, are not included among his collection because
they are very common and you can see them in the markets.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#24:1>
They are not rare or unusual. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#25:1>
Some plants are also horrible-looking.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#26:1>
He has a plant named <foreign> <it> Euphorbia hirroda </it>
</foreign> because of its horrible spines and <foreign> <it> Ferrocactus
</it> </foreign> , so named because of its ferocious spines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#27:1>
Because of its likeness to the white hairs of an old man, the
epithet of a certain cactus is <mention> <foreign> senilis </foreign>
</mention> - - scientifically called <foreign> <it> Cephalocereus senilis
</it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#28:1>
This is a globular type of plant fully covered with long white hairs.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#29:1>
The <foreign> <it> Nyctocereus serpentinus </it> </foreign> has a
serpentlike form; the <foreign> <it> Astrrophytum capricorne </it> </foreign>
for its goat-hornedlike spines and the <foreign> <it> Faucaria tigrina </it>
</foreign> for its leaves which are tigerlike in appearance. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#30:1>
<h> <bold> Care and propagation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#31:1>
How do you take care of weird plants and curiosities?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#32:1>
Being mutant, they are quite delicate.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#33:1>
Usually, they don't grow as fast as the normal ones most especially
the variegated and the fully colored types such as the reds, yellows, pinks
and lavanders.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#34:1>
The pigmentation or discoloration shows lack of chlorophyll. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#35:1>
Chlorophyll, according to scientists, is the green-coloring
matter of plants that helps in the manufacture of food for its growth and
development of stems, leaves, branches and all other parts.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#36:1>
The fully colored ones have no chlorophyll and, therefore, cannot
manufacture their own food. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#37:1>
In this case, they have to be grafted to another cactus of the
hardy type with sufficient chlorophyll that can tolerate any type of soil and
thrives in both temperate and tropical climate.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#38:1>
It is the stock then that can provide food for the scion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#39:1>
However, not just any other cactus can be used as stock but one
that has affinity or compatibility to each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#40:1>
The stocks usually used are the <foreign> <it> Hylocereus undatus
</it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it> Myrtillocactus geometrizanus </it>
</foreign> , <foreign> <it> Cephalocereus sp. </it> </foreign> and <foreign>
<it> Lemaereocereus beneckei </it> </foreign> , among others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#41:1>
As to potting medium, a mixture of one-part river sand, one-part
garden soil preferably the loam type and two parts compost will do.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#42:1>
Watering must be done only about once a week or when the medium is
dry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#43:1>
Place your plants in a well-lighted position but only about 60 to
70 percent sunlight.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#44:1>
This means not the direct scorching sun.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#45:1>
See to it that the place gets sufficient air circulation.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#46:1>
In areas where rains occur in longer periods night and day, house
your succulent collection with transparent plastic roofing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#47:1>
In humid and damp areas where fungus is likely to attack, apply
at least once a week with fungicide and insecticide if scales or mealy bugs
are present. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> <indig> 'Tikog' </indig> industry gets a boost </bold>
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#49:2>
<bold> Serapion S. Metilla </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#50:2>
<indig> <it> TIKOG </it> </indig> industry has been one of the
oldest folk handicrafts of the Visayans, particularly of Leyte and Samar, and
some of the tribes of Mindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#51:2>
But because the <indig> <it> tikog </it> </indig> plant, which grows
wild in open fresh-water marshlands, was never cultured scientifically, the
<indig> <it> tikog </it> </indig> handicrafts seem to be dwindling, as
weavers depend only on the availability of material provided by nature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#52:2>
<mention> <indig> <it> Tikog </it> </indig> </mention> , Visayan
name for a water grass belonging to the <foreign> Cyperaceae </foreign>
family, scientifically called <mention> <foreign> Fimbristylis globusa (
Retz.) Kunth </foreign> </mention> , is a tufted plant with fibrous roots,
having terminal inflorescences, with a simple or compound umbellate reduced
to a single spikelet.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#53:2>
Called <mention> <indig> <it> sud-sod </it> </indig> </mention> among
the natives of Bukidnon, it grows from 5 to 5 1/2 feet tall, with stems of
about 1/3 centimeter in diameter and almost uniform all the way up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#54:2>
The plant can be harvested when the inflorescences have fully
opened, somewhat dark brown in appearance with the stem turning dull green.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#55:2>
The harvested plants are then treated by hanging to air-dry for about
a week in a <indig> <it> kamalig </it> </indig> - type house.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#56:2>
Sun-drying is not advisable because they become brittle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#57:2>
When fully dried, somewhat light brown in color, they are ready
for using.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#58:2>
A few minutes before using, though, a bundle should be moistened to
enhance its pliancy.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#59:2>
For coloring, a special type of dye good for grass material is used.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#60:2>
With the ethnobotanical studies he conducted among the Tala-andig
tribe in <indig> Barangay </indig> Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, scientist IV
and National Museum chief botanist Romualdo M. del Rosario found out that
<indig> <it> tikog </it> </indig> and a type of bamboo locally called
<mention> <indig> <it> bagtok </it> </indig> </mention> grow well in the
vicinity.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#61:2>
Some in the community were into weaving, but not as an industry,
probably because of the lack of incentives. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#62:2>
The Tala-andigs live about 37 kilometers west of Malaybalay,
Bukidnon 's capital.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#63:2>
Located at the foot of Mt. Kitanlad, the place has a very mild
climate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#64:2>
Del Rosario recommended the culture of <indig> <it> tikog </it>
</indig> and <indig> <it> bagtok </it> </indig> to boost the community 's
weaving industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#65:2>
With the financial support of the Philippine Council for Agriculture,
Forestry, Research and Development ( PCAFRD), the project is now ongoing.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#66:2>
Because weaving can be easily done in the home, this promises to be a
potential moneymaker which can be of great help to this poor community. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#67:2>
<h> <bold> How to culture <indig> <it> tikog </it> </indig> </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#68:2>
In his experiments with the culture of <indig> <it> tikog </it>
</indig> , Herminio Pava, professor VI of Central Mindanao University in
Musuan, Bukidnon, recommends the following:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#69:2>
*Planting distance should be at least 8 &rdquo; to 10 &rdquo; away
from each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#70:2>
*Water supply should be constant, at least 2 &rdquo; above the soil
level.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#71:2>
*Fertilizer application, preferably the organic type, should be done
at least once a month.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#72:2>
*Sunlight should be full, at least eight hours a day.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#73:2>
*Weeding of foreign grasses should be regularly observed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#74:2>
*When 70 percent of the plant is matured, it is ready for harvesting.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#75:2>
With the aim of promoting the <indig> <it> tikog </it> </indig>
industry for the export market, a seminar-workshop with weaving hands-on
among the Tala-andigs was conducted two months ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#76:2>
The idea, according to Del Rosario, is not only to improve the
quality of workmanship and design but most of all to retain the handicrafts '
ethnic character.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#77:2>
Using the <indig> <it> tulugan </it> </indig> ( center for their
activities), the women do the weaving of mats, hats, baskets, bags, while the
men tend the farming of <indig> <it> tikog </it> </indig> with their corn,
vegetables, rice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#78:2>
Heading the tribal community is Adolino Saway ( with the title
<foreign> Datu </foreign> Makapukaw) as overall chieftain, assisted by his
younger brother Victorino ( <foreign> Datu </foreign> Migketay) as
administrator of the Tala-andig development projects.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#79:2>
They are thankful for the assistance the government is giving, which
they hope will be consistent. </p> </I>


<I>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#80:3>
<h> <bold> Have &peso;200,000, can join the <indig> tiangge </indig>
band </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#81:3>
<bold> Nancy C. Carvajal </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#82:3>
WITH a space of only 1.5 square meters, a capital of
&peso;200,000, plus a steady dose of drive and determination and a lot of
imagination, you can earn as much as &peso;20,000 to 30,000 a month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#83:3>
The tiny area is known as exhibit space or <indig> <it> tiangge
</it> </indig> and can be rented on the ground floor or corridors of malls
like the Makati Cinema Square. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#84:3>
It is perfect for starting an RTW stall. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#85:3>
To be an exhibitor, you will need a business permit from the
Department of Trade and Industry and a <indig> barangay </indig> permit.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#86:3>
The rent varies with the location and position of the booth, usually
on the ground floor and corridors of malls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#87:3>
If a booth has two sides--open on two sides--then the rent is
higher. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#88:3>
The rent ranges from &peso;15,000 to &peso;50,000 a month.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#89:3>
A rental contract is usually renewable every three months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#90:3>
Some malls raise the rates by a certain percentage each time the
contract is renewed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#91:3>
Then they go back to the original rate at the start of the calendar
year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#92:3>
Even during lean periods, a booth is known to make about
&peso;6,000 a day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#93:3>
A <indig> tiangge </indig> generally sells imported
ready-to-wear, imported blouses, skirts, pants, shorts, blazers--in all kinds
of materials, from velvet, gabardine and silk, to linen, cotton, leather and
others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#94:3>
A fashion sense and an eye for good material are important
factors in this kind of venture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#95:3>
Stall owners who have a bigger capital regularly travel to Hong
Kong, Bangkok or South Korea as <foreign> <it> viajeras </it> </foreign> to
buy goods, and to earn higher profit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#96:3>
If you have limited capital, you can buy your merchandise from
full-time <foreign> <it> viajeras </it> </foreign> , a number of whom can be
found in Baclaran and Divisoria.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#97:3>
Many <foreign> <it> viajeras </it> </foreign> sell their merchandise
in their own homes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#98:3>
In choosing the RTW items, for example, to sell, it is suggested
that you get at least three colors of each style, and half a dozen of each
color.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#99:3>
&ldquo; Leftovers &rdquo; can be repackaged and sold at a lower
price. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#100:3>
The lobbies and corridors of malls and big buildings that have
regular heavy human traffic are ideal sites for exhibits.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#101:3>
Parks are now also being used as exhibit locations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#102:3>
According to Jackie Collins, who has been an exhibitor for eight
years now, <quote> &ldquo; A lot of hard work and patience is needed in this
kind of business.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#103:3>
You have to be persuasive, on top of having good quality stuff, so
that the clientele will keep coming back.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#104:3>
Sometimes, you act as their fashion consultant and you have to be
sincere and honest about it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#105:3>
Exhibitors should also be always updated on the latest in
fashion.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#106:3>
Reading magazines and other materials can help you keep pace with
the latest and replenish your supply accordingly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#107:3>
The display of the merchandise is also an important factor in
attracting buyers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#108:3>
The items put on display must be the best and the latest styles from
your stocks.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#109:3>
Have enough commodities for the buyers to choose from. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#110:3>
Displays should be changed or rearranged everyday, so that
customers get a new perspective when they come back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#111:3>
For the display, you will need plenty of hangers, racks and even
mannequins.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#112:3>
The racks should be small, to fit into the limited booth space.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#113:3>
A rack that can carry 40-45 blouses costs &peso;1,000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#114:3>
Hangers cost about &peso;25 a dozen.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#115:3>
Mannequins for blouses cost &peso;120 a piece, for pants, &peso;180.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#116:3>
A whole-body mirror with good reflection and a fitting room are
also needed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#117:3>
If there is still space, shelves can be a useful addition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#118:3>
Usually, only one or two people are needed to man the booth.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-016#119:3>
It is also important to train them so that they have a better chance
of making a sale. </p> </I>
