<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#1:1:A>
I had so many many buyer of this property
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#2:1:A>
But I had been so much embarrassed and disappointed because in spite
of so many uh most of them had no money
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#3:1:A>
So I make it a point <indig> na </indig> I will not uh anymore give
an authority to anybody because I am very much disappointed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#4:1:A>
In this case uh because of the high recommendation of Mrs Galido to
you of of this transaction I am agreeing with the price as well as the terms
whatever he wants she wants provided you can bring your buyer here and we can
evaluate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#5:1:A>
Now your buyer I will make it more easier for her if uh we if we
will be used to have an <unclear> word </unclear> of her or his money I 'll
be accepting the the arrangement <indig> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#6:1:A>
But I will make this a very very easy terms for her provided you can
bring them here and we can size up the situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#7:1:A>
Now the time is very very important <&> phone rings </&> for us the
time frame of our transaction because we are going to have election
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#8:1:A>
As I for one if I can sell this property before the end of the month
I 'll have to take leave with my company because I will be one of the
campaign manager of a certain candidate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#9:1:A>
So you know I am a politician uh so I want to participate on this
election 'cause this might be our last election
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#10:1:A>
Uh last election because the military said that if we will have no
good election then they will annul the election and they will take over the
government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#11:1:A>
And if the military will take over the government most of us will
dislike the military there will be civil war
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#12:1:A>
And if there will be civil war the communists will expand their
number and they will take over on our government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#13:1:A>
That will be the end of the story of our democracy <O> laughter
 </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#14:1:A>
So you better rush this thing because I am in need of money I want
to go to politics
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#15:1:A>
Yes okay okay <indig> maski </indig> sixty days ninety days <indig> 
o </indig> one hundred twenty days balance

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#16:1:B>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#17:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#19:1:A>

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#20:1:C>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#21:1:A>

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#22:1:C>
<indig> Sige ho tatawagan natin </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#23:1:A>
<indig> Sino kaibigan mo ba 'yon na </indig> buyer

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#24:1:C>
<indig> Uh ano ho </indig> trustee <indig> ng </indig> buyer

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#25:1:A>
You better talk to him personally <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#26:1:A>
Uh <,> give it to him <&> tells the secretary to give the phone to
Speaker C </&> <,,> so we cannot be delayed <&> phone rings and speaker A
talks over the phone </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#27:1:A>
If possible tomorrow or Thursday because my <?> asset </?> will be
moving for abroad if they will be successful to get our money there I am not
going to sell this property anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#28:1:A>
As a matter of fact I really don't want to sell this property but
just a matter of challenge to everybody that property is good and had been
sold
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#29:1:A>
I will sell this if somebody is going to pay me immediately <,,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#30:1:C>
Golf course <indig> ho kasi ang balak nilang gawin dito
 </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#31:1:A>
<indig> Ang totoo ngayon uh uh </indig> the one that 's buying
Mr <@> Chanco </@> is making that into golf course
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#32:1:A>
As a matter of fact everything now is already fixed everything the
planning the topographic everything has been <indig> ano </indig> by them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#33:1:A>
They had spent already hundreds of thousands of pesos on their
planning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#34:1:A>
But there are they get around two hundred thousand two hundred
million loan from the bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#35:1:A>
And the president of the bank is their partner
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#36:1:A>
I but you see our agreement is he is supposed to give me thirty
million equity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#37:1:A>
They start uh developing the property and getting everything in the
property but they don't give me the money <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#38:1:A>
So as far as I 'm concerned I do not have any agreement with them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#39:1:A>
They are spending hundreds of thousands of pesos already but they
had not given me yet the money
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#40:1:A>
Therefore our transaction is not yet finish
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#41:1:A>
They should have given me the first agreement of thirty million
pesos uh equity that is uh last week
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#42:1:A>
But the <.> pa </.> they continue developing the property making
some ground planning and operation but yet <indig> ha </indig> they had not
paid us yet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#43:1:A>

property because they want to give give uh get that as golf

Thank you very much Mr uh bye
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#70:1:A>
<&> talking to people in office </&> First concern <indig> niya
 </indig> we are the one who make the project study and feasibility study of
Mr <@> Chanco </@> who submitted it already in bank and there is an approval
of the two hundred million already for this property <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#71:1:A>
So that is the situation at present

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#72:1:B>
Sir what will happen to the letter of authority

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#73:1:A>
Now uh look never mind <,> Mr <@> Chanco </@> want to develop
the property into golf
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#74:1:A>
If he will not pay me I 'll sell it to <@> Manzano </@> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#75:1:A>
The same plan okay because I do not care for Mr <@> Chanco </@> as
long as he doesn't pay me

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#76:1:C>
Yeah first come first served

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#77:1:A>
Yes yes if uh you you tell Mr <@> Manzano </@> if he will Mr
 <@> Chanco </@> will not pay me until tomorrow morning the the deal is off
 <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#78:1:A>
So Mr <@> Manzano </@> can buy my property okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#79:1:A>
He pay me twenty million thirty million pesos tomorrow I 'll I 'll
sign the agreement

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#80:1:B>
It 's not <@> Manzano </@> who is the buyer

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#81:1:A>
Yes whoever is the <indig> ano </indig> uh <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#82:1:A>
According to him it is a uh <indig> ano </indig> uh <indig> siguro
uh sa nangyayari dito ngayon </indig> Mr <@> Chanco </@> is <indig> lalabas
dito </indig> Mr <@> Manzano </@> is the developer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#83:1:A>
Now they had made an arrangement with the bank and according to Mr
 <@> Manzano </@> there is an approval of the two hundred million
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#84:1:A>
That is to confirm also <@> Chanco </@> told me two days ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#85:1:A>
Now with <@> Chanco </@> now entertaining the Japanese that might
be with our plan with <@> Chanco </@> because we become here a partner with
Mr <@> Chanco </@> as long as he give me the thirty million pesos requirement
equity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#86:1:A>
Now if the Japanese will pay him this twenty million dollar of the
finished golf then the obligation we got with the bank will be paid
automatically and <@> Manzano </@> might be there inside
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#87:1:A>
Now if Mr <@> Chanco </@> will not make good on his commitment to
me I can deal directly to <@> Manzano </@> with this authority through you Mr
Gozon okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#88:1:A>
So I am not afraid with anybody I 'll give you the authority
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#89:1:A>
First come first serve
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#90:1:A>
Five percent uh over price <{> <[> <,> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#91:1:A>
There must be this <&> phone rings </&> and is only for one week
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#92:1:A>
<&> talks to secretary </&> You give Mr Gozon only one week time to
transact we cannot wait that much <indig> ano uh kwan </indig> only one week
uh Nette <indig> ilagay mo </indig> <quote> this authority is only good for
one week </quote> uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#93:1:A>
Because if it is true <indig> na </indig> <@> Manzano </@> is
inside and he they are going to buy me out because of the loan approval uh
okay <indig> lang yan sa akin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#94:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> okay <indig> lang 'yan sa akin </indig> 
because uh the way I look at it they they make me as a <,> the pawn of the
transaction <indig> hindi ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#95:1:A>
The most important to me I can use my money for another purpose
okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#96:1:A>
<indig> Ngayon </indig> only five days

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#97:1:B>
<[> Commission </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#98:1:C>
Five days

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#99:1:A>
Uh five days only five days
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#100:1:A>
I mean Mr Gozon that will also drive everybody to close the
transaction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#101:1:A>
Remember <indig> na </indig> I gave you this authority because of
 <indig> pakiusap ni </indig> Mrs Galido

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#102:1:C>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#103:1:A>
I do not give that authority anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#104:1:A>
Now <indig> kapag nagkaipitan tayo ng panahon at nakita kong
maganda ang lakad ng inyong </indig> transaction I can extend it to you okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#105:1:A>
Just for the meantime place there only five days
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#106:1:A>
So today is twenty-two it will terminate on the twenty-seventh <,> 
okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#107:1:B>
To twenty nine

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#108:1:A>
Twenty nine no five days uh <indig> wala namang kwenta 'yon
tingnan no binigyan ako ng </indig> special authority <indig> dito mabasa man
ni <@> Chanco </@> 'yon hindi ako mapapahiya </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#109:1:A>
Because <indig> sabihin ko sa kaniya eh hinantay kita na bigyan mo
ako ng kuwarta kahapon hindi di </indig> I opened it to the market again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#110:1:A>
No okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#111:1:A>
That will be the situation okay five six only five days

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#112:1:B>
<indig> Hindi pa tapos <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#113:1:A>
<indig> Hindi pa tapos tatapusin natin </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#114:1:C>
Sir <indig> nagmamadali rin naman si </indig> Mr <@> Manzano
 </@> so five days is okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#115:1:A>
Yes you see the advantages of this five days <.> conse </.> 
 <indig> kuwan </indig> authority is uh upon presentation of that authority to
your buyer the that will be in black and white that you are only given five
days as a concession of Mrs Galido
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#116:1:A>
Now without them to execute uh we lost the transaction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#117:1:A>
Now <indig> kung halimbawa naman nasa </indig> in <indig> na kayo
 </indig> we are we are there are just a little thing to be ironed out and the
five days had run out I will be kind enough to extend you another uh so many
days

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#118:1:C>
<indig> Iniisip ko sir baka si Mr <@> Chanco </@> baka isa
siya sa </indig> group <indig> kasi </indig> Mr <@> Manzano </@> is only a
trustee

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#119:1:A>
Uh I the way I look at it he told me <indig> nga </indig> 
 <quote> he is one of my partner and besides we had been to lunch today and uh
we are the one making his project study </quote> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#120:1:C>
<indig> Kasi ho gusto ho naming gusto ho naming pasyalan 'yung

<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#122:1:C>
Mr <@> Manzano </@>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#123:1:A>
Mr <@> Manzano </@> no Mr <@> Chanco </@> just come in
 <indig> mga </indig> fifteen days ago <{> <[> <,> </[> with his wife and
children <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#124:1:A>
Because he is associated I think he is the <indig> balae </indig> 
of of uh George <@> See </@> of the <@> Philippine Bank </@> the owner of the
ano and then he has an arrangement also with the Philippine National Bank
through <@> Lopez </@> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#125:1:A>
So <,> there might be some sort of arrangement so what is
important to me is to finish the transaction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#126:1:A>
Uh <@> Chanco </@> will call for me because Mr <@> Manzano </@> 
will contact <@> Chanco </@> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#127:1:A>
I told him <quote> let <@> Chanco </@> know that I am only giving
him until tomorrow for the ten million if not I will accept anybody uh
 </quote> <indig> ano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-071#128:1:A>
