 <$A>
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#1:1:A>
Female married from Bataan was admitted with the presenting symptom of
severe gastric pain
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#2:1:A>
The accompanying signs and symptoms were fever nausea and vomiting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#3:1:A>
Physical examination revealed fever tachycardia hypotension
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#4:1:A>
The lungs were positive for <?> basilar rals </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#5:1:A>
Abdominal examination revealed tenderness diminished <.> bre </.> 
bowel sounds and there is a positive <?> collin </?> sign
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#6:1:A>
Pertinent past medical history revealed that the patient has mumps two
weeks prior to admission
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#7:1:A>
Uh we are entertaining a case of acute pancreatitis to rule out the
following conditions namely acute cholecystitis cholelithiasis pyclonephritis
and hepatic abscess abscess
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#8:1:A>
We are also ruling out peptic ulcer disease as well as acute
appendicitis

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#9:1:B>
With uh epigastric pain noted on this patient is there any
association association to meals
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#10:1:B>
Does it occur uh thirty or ninety minutes after meals or is there
any radiation of the pain to the right scapular area or at the back

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#11:1:A>
Ah this patient has a localized epigastric pain
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#12:1:A>
It is not related to any food intake or <indig> ano </indig> any
radiation at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#13:1:A>
That 's why we ruled out cholelithiasis <{> <[> disease </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#14:1:B>
<[> Since in </[> </{> cholelithiasis the symptoms occurs only
when the stone produces an inflammation or an obstruction of the cystic or
the common bile duct
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#15:1:B>
But on physical examination the abdomen can be noted to be normal
or there is only a <.> rap </.> an uh a right upper quadrant pain

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#16:1:A>
Uh huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#17:1:B>
In your case the patient presented with an abdominal
tenderness a diminished bowel sound and <?> collin 's </?> positive <?> 
collin 's </?> signs which is uh likely not found in the case of
cholelithiasis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#18:1:B>
And one thing more on a simple ultrasonography of the abdomen in
you will right away note a stone formation in the gall bladder
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#19:1:B>
So we can easily rule out the existence of cholelithiasis in this
case
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#20:1:B>
How about considering uh a case of uh the existence of
pyelonephritis in this case

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#21:1:A>
Uh <,> <&> break in the recording </&> the past medical <.> 
his </.> history of this patient was negative for any urinary tract infection
which is usually true in <.> pyelone </.> pyelonephritis <,> <&> break in the
recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#22:1:A>
And on physical examination the kidney <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 
were also negative which is usually true in pyelonephritis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#23:1:A>
That 's why we tried to we ruled out pyelonephritis in this case
 <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#24:1:B>
Because of the
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#25:1:B>
Did you note any <.> ab </.> <&> break in the recording </&> on
your physical examination did you note any uh <?> ichtricia </?> of the
conjunctiva or any fever

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#26:1:A>
It was negative the <?> ichtricia </?> is negative
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#27:1:A>
But the patient was febrile on admission

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#28:1:B>
Was there any uh profuse sweating during the night any weight
loss or any any loss of appetite or any changes in bowel movement

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#29:1:A>
Uh it was negative all of these were negative according to the
patient

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#30:1:B>
So the the possibility of an existence of uh of a hepatic
abscess is very nil since the history of this patient points uh rules out the
existence of uh hepatic abscess on the basis of the absence of the severe
abdominal pain the palpable mass on the right upper quadrant which was not
noted in this case

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#31:1:A>
Yeah that 's true <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#32:1:B>
The epigastric pain noted in this case is not associated with
meals
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#33:1:B>
So peptic ulcer diseases is easily ruled out
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#34:1:B>
How about uh the obstetrical clearance and the surgical clearance
of this case
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#35:1:B>
When was the last menstrual period

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#36:1:A>
Uh the last menstrual period was uh June <,> ten

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#37:1:B>
June ten

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#38:1:A>
Of this <{> <[> year </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#39:1:B>
<[> So </[> </{> the existence of any ectopic pregnancies in
the uh intrauterine tumors or <.> whats </.> whatsoever that causes that will
manifest as an acute abdomen in this case is also <{> <[> ruled out </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#40:1:A>
<[> Is also ruled out </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#41:1:B>
How about the coexistence with uh an acute appendicitis

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#42:1:A>
An acute <.> appec </.> appendicitis as first at first was
entertained
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#43:1:A>
However we immediately ruled it out uh after doing some physical
examination because uh in acute appendicitis the pain is uh located at the
 <?> McBurnis </?> area as well as the rebound tenderness which is all
negative in this case

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#44:1:B>
Ahhh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#45:1:A>
So we easily ruled it out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#46:1:B>
With all the differential diagnosis fully discussed in this
case the manifestations noted really points out to an acute pancreatitis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#47:1:B>
We are left with uh the laboratory diagnosis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#48:1:B>
We will be guided if we request a serum amylase and serum lipase
determination and other auxiliary procedures like uh complete blood count
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#49:1:B>
And if the patient can afford it would be much appreciated if we
can do a C T scan which can confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis and will be
useful for predicting in predicting the outcome and identification of late
complications
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#50:1:B>
We will manage the case as an acute pancreatitis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#51:1:B>
We will be compelled to give analgesia preferably Meperadin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#52:1:B>
If it warrants we will put on I V intravenous fluids
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#53:1:B>
We will be placing the patient on a nasogastric intubation and N P
O
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#54:1:B>
We will treat the hypocalcemia if we note a presence of this case
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#55:1:B>
Antibiotics is also necessary when we if we will be able to
establish a concurrent infection and we 're obliged to give Cimetidine or any
antacid to prevent a stress ulcer from developing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#56:1:B>
So this is a <?> frank </?> case of acute pancreatitis </I> 
 <subtext.2> 


 <I> <&> tape does not record what the other person is saying, just pauses

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#57:2:A>
So May twenty-three today is June fifteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#58:2:A>
Seven plus fifteen twenty-two twenty-two days old
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#59:2:A>
He or she <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#60:2:A>
Girl good
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#61:2:A>
Lucky you <indig> ha </indig> one boy and one girl
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#62:2:A>
<indig> Hoy </indig> Albert is already three years old <indig> 'no
 </indig> three three and a half
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#63:2:A>
Oh good <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#64:2:A>
You know how to space your children good family planning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#65:2:A>
Is there any problem <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#66:2:A>
Oh I see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#67:2:A>
So this is your first well-baby check-up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#68:2:A>
She 's cute okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#69:2:A>
She 's big and very active
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#70:2:A>
Good suck <indig> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#71:2:A>
It looks hungry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#72:2:A>
Are you breastfeeding <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#73:2:A>
Why not <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#74:2:A>
No you just have to be patient
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#75:2:A>
Just let your baby suck so flow will improve
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#76:2:A>
You know the stimulus to improve I mean increase your secretion is
sucking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#77:2:A>
Now every time your baby sucks she is sending a signal to your
brain to produce some more milk
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#78:2:A>
It 's just like saying <mention> Mom I need some more milk
 </mention> so you produce some more milk
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#79:2:A>
Whereas if you bottle-feed your baby at the time when you 're
supposed to give her your breast there will be no more sucking and you will
be sending a negative feedback
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#80:2:A>
So you stop producing milk because she doesn't need your milk
anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#81:2:A>
Now in order that your secretion will increase all you have to do
is let your baby suck
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#82:2:A>
It 's really sucking that improves the secretion <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#83:2:A>
Yes it may be painful but that is only temporary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#84:2:A>
After some time you learn to adjust and there will be no more pain
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#85:2:A>
You know it will be very unfortunate if you stop breastfeeding your
baby now because there 's just too much too many advantages
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#86:2:A>
Not only do you establish a good maternal bonding that is a close
relationship between you and your baby it is also very economical
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#87:2:A>
Although I know you can afford to buy these expensive formulas but
that is not enough
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#88:2:A>
Your baby is a human being and you are supposed to give her human
milk not cow 's milk
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#89:2:A>
Then not only that <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#90:2:A>
The most important thing is your milk contains a lot of antibodies
and these will help protect your baby from common infection
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#91:2:A>
Well you know even if you have cough or colds if it is contagious
whether or not you breastfeed your baby she will get it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#92:2:A>
But if you breastfeed her you 'll be giving her antibodies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#93:2:A>
So her resistance will improve and she will recover faster
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#94:2:A>
You see I 'm speaking from experience <indig> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#95:2:A>
More than a doctor I am a mother breastfeeding mother
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#96:2:A>
I have five kids and I breastfeed all of them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#97:2:A>
Funny <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#98:2:A>
You know every time I get pregnant a lot of these uhm medical
representatives offer me their their formulas
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#99:2:A>
They 're giving it for free
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#100:2:A>
And yet I still breastfeed my baby
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#101:2:A>
And you know the feeling is terrific
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#102:2:A>
There is a feeling of contentment <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#103:2:A>
You know another thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#104:2:A>
If you are breastfeeding you don't have to sterilize bottles
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#105:2:A>
You don't have to worry about formulas getting out of stock or
your source of water
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#106:2:A>
You know a lot of mothers now are already using this what do you
call this mineral water and it 's quite expensive you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#107:2:A>
And not only that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#108:2:A>
You don't even have to get up at night to to prepare formulas
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#109:2:A>
Your milk is there safe and ready available any time you need it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#110:2:A>
But of course you you also have to take care of yourself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#111:2:A>
You have to eat and drink a lot
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#112:2:A>
And take note <indig> ha </indig> it is not true that
breastfeeding while you 're you 're depressed or you 're tired is bad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#113:2:A>
There 's no such thing <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#114:2:A>
Well have I convinced you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#115:2:A>
Say <mention> yes </mention> because if not I will not stop unless
you do okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#116:2:A>
Oh by the way do you have a baby book <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#117:2:A>
Not yet okay I will give you one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#118:2:A>
You know you 're really lucky <indig> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#119:2:A>
I just got it yesterday it 's been out of stock for several months
already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#120:2:A>
Hmm she 's alright
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#121:2:A>
You can start with her vitamins now and be sure to burp your baby
after each feeding <indig> ha </indig> and give sterile water in between
feeding <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#122:2:A>
Gas pains
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#123:2:A>
Hmm you know you will minimize gas pains if you let her burp every
after feeding
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#124:2:A>
And if she still does you may try turning her on her abdomen like
this okay like that and then gently pat or stroke her back like this okay and
later on she will pass out air
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#125:2:A>
Good <,,> okay bring her back on July eight oh July five for her
immunization
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#126:2:A>
She will start with B C G
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-079#127:2:A>
Then at two months O P V and D P T and so on okay </I>
