<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#3:1>
In the Philippines, <it> <foreign> Schistosoma japonicum
</foreign> </it> , the causative agent of Oriental schistosomiasis, was first
described by Wooley in 1906.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#4:1>
Thereafter, infections were detected among inmates of Bilibid Prison
in Manila ( Garrison 1908, Willets 1914), and among patients of the
Philippine General Hospital coming from the islands of Leyte, Samar,
Sorsogon, Mindanao and Luzon ( Hizon 1928).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#5:1>
These discoveries resulted in a number of surveys conducted on other
endemic areas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#6:1>
However, it was not until 1951 that the Philippine government came to
recognize the extent and impact of the disease, leading to the creation of
the Division of Schistosomiasis in the Department of Health.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#7:1>
In 1952, the World Health Organization fully funded a five-year
research project ( Santos 1976) which marked the beginning of the fight
against schistosomiasis in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#8:1>
The amphibious snail, <it> <foreign> Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi
</foreign> </it> , was first recognized by Tubangi ( 1932) in Palo, Leyte as
the intermediate host of <it> <foreign> S. japonicum </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#9:1>
Like other intermediate hosts of parasitic species, <it> <foreign> O.
h. quadrasi </foreign> </it> is normally found in places where
schistosomiasis is endemic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#10:1>
<foreign> Schistosomiasis japonicum </foreign> is endemic in
Luzon and in the Visayan Islands.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#11:1>
Mindanao also has several known endemic areas; in Southeastern
Mindanao--Davao del Sur in particular--the only places reported endemic for
schistosomiasis prior to 1987 were Digos and Hagonoy ( Santos 1976, Hinz
1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#12:1>
The first 12 human cases of schistosomiasis were reported among the
native Bilaans and Bogobos of the <foreign> sitios </foreign> of Demoloc and
Kilalag in Malita, Davao del Sur in 1987 ( Schistosomiasis Team Report,
Digos, 1987).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#13:1>
Furthermore, surveys conducted by the group indicated that the
infection was autochthonous or indigenous to the area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#14:1>
Such a finding was indeed alarming, considering the possible
establishment of new foci of schistosomiasis transmission in Malita, Davao
del Sur, a place which was previously nonedemic for the infection.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#15:1>
Also in 1987, the Schistosomiasis Team in Digos conducted a survey of
oncomelanid snails in Demoloc and Kilalag, and found no oncomelanid snails.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#16:1>
This study sought to establish the presence or absence of
oncomelanid snails in the <foreign> sitios </foreign> Demoloc and Kilalag
and, if present, to identify areas endemic for oncomelanid snails found to be
positive for schistosome infection. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#17:1>
<h> <bold> MATERIALS AND METHODS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#18:1>
Demoloc and Kilalag are adjacent <foreign> sitios </foreign> of
Malita, Davao del Sur, located at a high altitude, and cover a surface area
of approximately 11,000 hectares.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#19:1>
These places have a hilly terrain ( Figs. 1, 2 and 3), and are
characterized by small bodies of water such as canals, creeks, swamps and
rice paddies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#20:1>
The place has a variety of vegetation ranging from trees to shrubs,
grass and weeds.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#21:1>
Demoloc and Kilalag have a population of 7,450 and 3,570 respectively
( Malita Municipal Office Census 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#22:1>
These <foreign> sitios </foreign> could be reached by transportation
via a rough, steep and very narrow road, or by foot for about seven hours.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#23:1>
Snail collection was conducted during three separate periods (
May 6-11, 1988 and September 1-8, 1988 in Demoloc and Kilalag; April 3-18,
1989 in Talucanga, Malita).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#24:1>
This was done by either of the following methods: ( 1) submerging
banana leaves and fronds, dried corn cobs and coconut husks on the sides and
bottom substrate of sampling sites like river, creeks, swamps and freshwater
ponds; ( 2) collecting submerged coconut husks or any bottom substrate with
snails attached to it; or ( 3) collecting bottom soil with snails, and
washing off soil particles with the use of sieves.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#25:1>
Possible contact with cercariae-infested water was prevented by using
gloves and boots during the entire duration of the survey and snail
collection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#26:1>
Snails collected were sorted according to size.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#27:1>
Those snails bigger than 10 mm were discarded ( oncomelanid snails
measure from 3.5 to 7.0 mm in shell height).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#28:1>
Using gross examination, all other snail species whose shell shapes
were obviously different from oncomelanid snails and similar prosobranch
species were likewise discarded.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#29:1>
Those snails that were left were fixed in 95% ETOH or 10% formalin,
and were brought to the De La Salle University Biology laboratory.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#30:1>
With the aid of microscopy, those snails that exhibited features
similar to oncomelanid snails were set aside for further examination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#31:1>
Snails that exhibited shell features similar to oncomelanid
snails were gently crushed, their liver organ cut off from the snail 's soft
body and teased lightly to determine the presence or absence of infection (
i. e., presence of parasite larvae called sporocysts).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#32:1>
The entire procedure was carried out with the use of a dissecting and
a compound microscope. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#33:1>
Water temperature, water depth and the general types and density
of vegetation were noted.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#34:1>
The surface area of each sampling site was estimated with the use of
an ordinary rope with markings and/or a carpenter 's measuring tape. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#35:1>
During the initial sampling period ( May 1988), 5 of the 12
individuals identified by the Department of Health Integrated Provincial
Health Office and Schistosomiasis Team in Digos ( 1987) were located ( Figs.
4 and 5).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#36:1>
The interviews with the parents of infected children and other
enthusiastic folk helped the proponent to identify water-sites frequented by
the children which possibly served as the habitats of oncomelanid snails.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#37:1>
The data gathered by the Schistosomiasis Team in Digos ( 1987)
from the examination of stool samples were made available to the proponent.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#38:1>
This facilitated the analysis of the prevalence rates of parasitic
infections other than <foreign> Schistosomiasis japonicum </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#39:1>
Other vital information extrapolated from the data are believed to be
useful in determining the level of treatment to be given to the town folk, as
well as in the development of strategies aimed at controlling parasite
transmission. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#40:1>
<h> <bold> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#41:1>
In Demoloc and Kilalag, sites for oncomelanid snails included the
following: one long and winding river ( 4-5 m wide, 2-2.5 ft deep and 25 km
long, of which about 5 km were covered); five swamps ( 20-55 sq m, 0.5-4. 5
ft deep) with vegetation cover composed primarily of <it> <foreign> Ipomea
perstans </foreign> </it> ( <indig> &ldquo; kangkong &rdquo; </indig> ) ,
weeds, shrubs and grass ( Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9); three canals ( 300-600 sq m,
1-1.5 ft deep) with weed decaying coconut husks, coconut and banana fronds
and other decaying organic matter ( Fig. 10); one deep well and its
peripheral area, and one creek ( about 4,500 sq m) ( Fig. 11).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#42:1>
Water temperature in the sampling sites ranged from 16-29.6&degree;
C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#43:1>


<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#44:1>
Several prosobranch and pulmonate snails were observed in the
sampling sites.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#45:1>
Hundreds of those snails whose sizes approximated the size range of
oncomelanid snails were set aside and examined in the laboratory.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#46:1>
The five snail species examined were identified as two pulmorate
snails belonging to genus <it> <foreign> Physastra </foreign> </it> and genus
<it> <foreign> Myxas </foreign> </it> , and three prosobranch snails
belonging to genus <it> <foreign> Melanoides </foreign> </it> , genus <it>
<foreign> Vivipara </foreign> </it> and genus <foreign> <it> Tarebia </it>
</foreign> ( Burch 1980).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#47:1>
Only one of the snails, <it> <foreign> Melanoides sp </foreign> </it> .,
a prosobranch ( shell morphology of young snails similar to <it> <foreign> O.
h. quadrasi </foreign> </it> ) collected from a canal with decaying logs,
coconut husks and fronds, was found to be infected.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#48:1>
Out of 342 <it> <foreign> Melanoides sp. </foreign> </it> snails
collected, 92 ( 26.9%) were found to contain the intra molluscan larvae <it>
sporocysts </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#49:1>
During the third sampling period ( April, 1989), travel to
Demoloc and Kilalag was impossible due to continuous heavy rains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#50:1>
The proponent instead visited the <foreign> sitio </foreign> of
Talucanga in the municipality of Malita, Davao del Sur and carried out snail
sampling.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#51:1>
Talucanga was chosen by the proponent as the alternative sampling
area, as this <foreign> sitio </foreign> had also been identified by the
Schistosomiasis Team in Digos ( 1984, personal communication) and by the
Municipal Health Office of Malita ( 1983, 1984, personal communication) as
another possible transmission site for schistosomiasis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#52:1>
This hypothesis was formulated based on the death of two young boys
who exhibited clinical manifestations of an infection akin to <foreign>
schistosomiasis japonicum </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#53:1>
Sites surveyed for snails in <foreign> sitio </foreign> Talucanga
included one canal ( 150 m long), weedy and with decaying organic matters;
one river ( 76 m long 1. 5 m wide), stony and with less vegetation and one
swampy place ( about 10,000 sq m; 0.5-2 ft deep) with <it> <foreign> I.
perstans </foreign> </it> as the predominant form of vegetation, in addition
to weeds and grass. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#54:1>
One of the small snails collected from a Talucanga swamp
exhibited morphological similarities to <it> <foreign> Melanoides sp.
</foreign> </it> , a prosobranch snail for fluke infection.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#55:1>
These snails were brought live to the house and were examined ( i.e.,
the shell was crushed and dissected, and 0.64% Ringer 's solution was applied
to the exposed snail liver to induce <foreign> cercariae </foreign> to come
out, if the snails were infected).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#56:1>
This procedure was necessary to verify earlier findings by the
proponent regarding <it> <foreign> Melanoides sp. </foreign> </it> snails.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#57:1>
Interestingly, the <foreign> cercariae </foreign> that emerged from
the liver tissue were <foreign> xiphidiocercariae </foreign> ( i.e.,
<foreign> cercariae </foreign> with an oral stylet) and not the <foreign>
brevifurcocercariae </foreign> which are characteristic of the <foreign>
schistosome cercariae </foreign> that normally develop in oncomelanid snails.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#58:1>
This finding provided strong evidence that the prosobranch snail
species collected from Demoloc and Kilalag found to contain sporocysts was
<it> <foreign> Melanoides sp. </foreign> </it> and not <it> <foreign> O. h.
quadrasi </foreign> </it> as earlier reported. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#59:1>
No oncomelanid snails were found in the areas or sites surveyed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#60:1>
The negative results gathered from this study do not altogether imply
that oncomelanid snails are nonexistent in the area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#61:1>
The proponent strongly believes that there must be places in the vast
land area of Demoloc and Kilalag not covered by this study that provide
favorable breeding grounds for <it> <foreign> O. h. quadrasi </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#62:1>
The 12 documented human cases of <foreign> schistosomiasis japonicum
</foreign> among 3-to 5-year old children and a 33-year old female (
Schistosomiasis Team, Digos, 1987) who have never left Demoloc and Kilalag
longer than necessary, strongly support the hypothesis that <foreign>
schistosomiasis japonicum </foreign> is autochthonous to the area ( i.e.,
infection was contracted from their own surroundings and not from other
established endemic areas.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#63:1>
Furthermore, the time schedule as well as the frequency of snail
collection may account for the negative results of this study.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#64:1>
Weeks before and during the sampling periods, on certain days, there
were continuous heavy rains which caused delay and difficulties in snail
sampling.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#65:1>
Pesigan, Hairston, Jauregui, Garcia, Santos, Santos & Besa ( 1958),
and Santos ( 1976) noted that the amphibious oncomelanid snail prefers a
climatic condition with no pronounced maximum rain period and no marked dry
season.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#66:1>
Likewise, oncomelanid snails and their eggs, being very minute, can
easily be flushed away by heavy rains and strong water current.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#67:1>
Problems related to bad roads which made travel very risky ( Figs.
12, 13 and 14), as well as problems of security and safety, prevented the
proponent from carrying out snail sampling as frequently as should have been
necessary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#68:1>
The proponent had earlier proposed to gather information related
to the educational background of the town folk, and the services provided to
them in terms of sanitation, bathing, washing, recreation and potable water
source.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#69:1>
Interviews with these people, however, indicated that the
questionnaire prepared for the activity was no longer necessary.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#70:1>
The first visit to the area revealed that the majority of the
residents only completed the primary grades, and very few reached the higher
elementary grade levels.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#71:1>
The living conditions and surroundings of the people were obviously
destitute as evidenced by the absence of basic services for sanitation and
health ( Figs. 15, 16 and 17). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#72:1>
Data on parasitological survey using fecal examinations (
Kato-Katz technique) carried out by the Schistosomiasis Team in Digos (
1987), as analyzed by the proponent, showed a total of 846 collected stool
samples ( 718 stool samples from Kilalag; 128 stool samples from Demoloc).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#73:1>
The ages of the subjects ranged from less than one year to 74 years
of age.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#74:1>
Stool samples analyzed totaled 344 and 278 for female and male
patients, respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#75:1>
A total of 622 samples were pooled and analyzed by the proponent for
epidemiologic data such as prevalence rates, and sex and age-distribution of
the infections noted.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#76:1>
The remaining 224 samples not included in the analysis either showed
no findings or had no information about age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#77:1>
Table 1 shows the prevalence rates and the infection rates
according to the sex-distribution of helminthic infections diagnosed in the
area.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#78:1>
Hookworm infection registered a high prevalence rate of 39.06%, with
more cases recorded in females ( 52.26%) compared to males ( 47.73%).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#79:1>
The identification of the specific causative agent of hookworm
infection cannot be determined based on stool examination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#80:1>
The identification of hookworm species requires soil examination for
the presence of hookworm larvae rhabditiform and/or filariform ( Manalabng
1925a).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#81:1>
It can be conjectured, however, that the hookworm infection noted in
the area may be of a mixed species, <it> <foreign> Ancylostoma duodenale
</foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> Necator americanus </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#82:1>
These two human forms of hookworms are endemic in the country, <it>
<foreign> N. americanus </foreign> </it> being the predominant species ( Cole
1907a, 1907b; Craig 1903; Manalang 1925b, 1925c, 1926; Cabrera 1981; Tubangi,
Basaca, Pasco & Rosario 1938; Tubangi & Cabrera 1948).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#83:1>
One hundred and eighty-six cases ( 76.54%) of hookworm infection were
noted among patients aged 30 years and younger ( Table 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#84:1>
The high hookworm infection rate and age distribution pattern noted
in this study corroborate findings of other epidemiologic surveys conducted
in other endemic areas in the country ( Tubangi & Cabrera 1948, Dominguez
1969, Pesigan & Yogore 1965).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#85:1>
Likewise, the rural agricultural setting of Demoloc and Kilalag
positively correlates with the high hookworm prevalence, the infection being
transmitted via skin contact with contaminated soil ( Hinz 1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#86:1>
The higher infection rate noted among females compared to males does
not agree with the sex-related distribution pattern of hookworm infection
reported in other endemic areas ( Pesigan & Yogore 1965, Dominguez, 1969).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-027#87:1>
It appears, though, that the higher infection rate in females may not
be real, considering the greater number of stool samples examined from
females ( 344) compared to only 278 stool samples from male patients. </p>
