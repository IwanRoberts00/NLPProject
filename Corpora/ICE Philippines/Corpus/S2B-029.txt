<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#1:1:A>
Mr President there are perhaps as many ways to look at the V F
A as there are observers and critics and there are equally numerous issues
that can be <?> brought </?> and discussed in order to form an opinion either
favoring or rejecting this Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#2:1:A>
There will be no end to the debates but by the end of the day we
need to make a choice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#3:1:A>
And as is true on any other issue we need to decide no matter how
difficult the choices may be and act in accordance with our conscience and
what we believe is to our national interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#4:1:A>
Mr President no one I repeat no one has a monopoly of patriotism
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#5:1:A>
I cast my vote in favor of the Visiting Forces Agreement
ratification in the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#6:1:A>
I do so with much confidence and optimism that the greatest
interests of the Filipino people shall have been served when this treaty
finally comes into force
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#7:1:A>
My vote favoring the ratification of the V F A is anchored on two
fundamental concerns one the need to strengthen our defense capability and
two the legal and constitutional issues which if adequately understood by
everyone would expose and erase the false fears peddled about by the <.> v
 </.> about the V F A by its opponents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#8:1:A>
Mr President to begin with the V F A merely operationalizes previous
agreements forged between the Philippines and the United States under the
Mutual Defense Treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#9:1:A>
Under Article two of the Mutual Defense Treaty both parties had
agreed to separately and jointly by self-help and mutual aid maintain and
develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#10:1:A>
But these being short on the <.> de </.> on the details of how to
go about developing such capacity to resist armed attack Article three of the
same treaty broadly mandates the foreign ministers of both parties or their
deputies to consult from time to time regarding the treaty 's implementation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#11:1:A>
Mr President there is a diversity of possibilities that are heavily
hinged on the V F A 's ratification or rejection not the least of which is
the promotion and preservation of the country 's economic security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#12:1:A>
This stems from the fact that the bulk of the <w> Philippines' </w> 
trade and economic ties with other countries is carried out in the vast
expanse of the South China Sea
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#13:1:A>
For instance Mr President data reveal that about forty percent of
our exports which are shipped to the different parts of Asia is almost wholly
transported through the South China Sea and surrounding seas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#14:1:A>
Another twenty-five percent of our exports to Europe is likewise
shipped through routes along or traversing this sea
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#15:1:A>
On top of that more than ninety percent of our oil supply from
major trading partners is also transported through the South China Sea
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#16:1:A>
Trade in this region and beyond may even be expected to expand on
account of globalization and the increasing economic interdependence of
nations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#17:1:A>
Yet the threats to regional security and stability remain Mr
President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#18:1:A>
The still-unsettled question of sovereignty overs over the Spratlys
for instance is continually seen as a potential flashpoint of conflict
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#19:1:A>
It has to be emphasized that despite the growing importance of the
South China Sea to us there appears to be no way or no means for us to
actually defend or enforce our interest therein
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#20:1:A>
No less than our own Defense Department has admitted the painful if
not so surprising fact that our country is militarily weak and extremely
vulnerable to the external threats and that it neither has the mean it
neither has to the means nor <,> it neither has the means nor the influence
to deter those who would take our patrimony and cut away our sovereignty in
front of our very eyes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#21:1:A>
Mr President it will not be often that an opportunity to strengthen
our capability to enforce our common interest with the United States will
present itself
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#22:1:A>
The V F A is one such opportunity we cannot afford to miss
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#23:1:A>
For without the Visiting Forces Agreement any thought of arming
ourselves in defense of our interests or to deter aggression will be
meaningless
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#24:1:A>
On the other hand through the Visiting Forces Agreement we shall
have the practical means to one improve the capability of our armed forces
two strengthen our national defense strategy three <.> stren </.> strengthen
regional stability and our relations with the United States in all important
dimensions security trade foreign policy environmental protection and
resource preservation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#25:1:A>
Having thus said <,> let me just enter into the records my position
on the various contin contentious issues raised by those opposing the
Visiting Forces Agreement particularly the constitutional and legal points
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#26:1:A>
My vote in favor of the Visiting Forces Agreement carries with it
the submission that there are no constitutional or legal infirmities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#27:1:A>
One the V F A need not go through the ratification process under
Article eighteen Section twenty-five of the Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#28:1:A>
An examination of the records of the Constitutional Commission
reveals that temporary placement of troops in Philippine territory as that
contemplated under the V F A need not go through the special procedural
requirement under Article eighteen Section twenty-five
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#29:1:A>
Clearly Mr President the intent of the framers of our Constitution
is that the placement or stationing of such foreign forces and installation
in the country must be made with some degree of permanency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#30:1:A>
And let me quote the records of the Constitutional Convention
volume four page seven hundred eighty-two to seven hundred eighty-three <X> 
long quotation </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#31:1:A>
Mr President this view is in fact supported by the opinion number
thirty-four series of nineteen ninety-seven of the Department of Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#32:1:A>
The opinion reads in part quote <quote> This Department has
consistently ruled that the aforementioned uh aforequoted <.> e </.> 
Constitutional provision disallows the establishment of foreign military
bases and the facilities for stationing of foreign troops similar to the U S
military presence in the Philippines under the R P - U S Military Bases
Agreement of nineteen forty-seven as amended and that it prohibits the
presence of alien military units in the country which is characterized by
some degree of permanency and magnitude unless the conditions set forth in
the Constitution are met </quote> <X> additional quoted sentences </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#33:1:A>
Since the Visiting Forces Agreement pertains to and provides only
for brief and temporary visits of U S troops in the Philippines the Agreement
may be thus ratified on the basis of Article seven Section twenty-one of the
Constitution which sets <quote> no treaty or international agreement shall be
valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the
members of the Senate </quote> under Article six Section twenty-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#34:1:A>
Second Mr President even if it be conceived that the V F A is
within the ambit of Article eighteen Section twenty-five the Agreement would
still be constitutional and a binding agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#35:1:A>
The premise of those who argue for the submission under Article
eighteen is that the V F A would be unconstitutional in the absence of advice
and consent by the U S Senate which they believe is not forthcoming in view
of the United States government 's pronouncement to that effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#36:1:A>
Thus there being no such ratification by the U S Senate it is
argued by the critics that the V F A cannot be considered as to have been
duly recognized by the United States government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#37:1:A>
Mr President the argument carries with it the implication that our
constitutional requirements be complied with by a sovereign equal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#38:1:A>
This cannot be so Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#39:1:A>
As articulated by two distwinguis distinguished members of the
Constitutional Commission ratification may be effected in accordance with the
laws of such other contracting state
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#40:1:A>
Allow me to quote therefore the exchange between Commissioners
Maombong and Bernas found in volume four of the records of the Constitutional
Commission page seven hundred eighty-two <X> quoted exchange </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#41:1:A>
Clearly then Mr President the recognition by the other contracting
state shall be in accordance with its own constitutional or municipal laws
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#42:1:A>
This is necessarily so since under international law a state cannot
impose its own municipal requirements on another state
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#43:1:A>
Three on criminal jurisdiction I submit that the Visiting Forces
Agreement provisions governing criminal jurisdiction add nothing more to what
the Philippines already adheres to under generally accepted principles of
international law which by explicit constitutional affirmation is made part
of the law of the land
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#44:1:A>
The V F A provisions on criminal jurisdiction derogate Philippine
sovereignty no more than the country 's adherence to a host of other treaties
and to the generally accepted principles of international law particularly on
the aspect of sovereign immunity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#45:1:A>
Let me quote an authority on this point <X> long quotation from a
foreign author </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#46:1:A>
Mr President the grant of sovereign immunity is made more explicit
in the case of foreign troops
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#47:1:A>
It has been ruled by our Supreme Court in the case of Beyer versus
Tison G R number L dash two four two nine four May three nineteen seventy
four <X> long quotation </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#48:1:A>
Mr President nonetheless our Supreme Court was quick to add that
such principle shall yield to treaty stipulations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#49:1:A>
The V F A therefore Mr President shall limit the applicability and
extent of the doctrine by allowing exercise of jurisdiction by the
Philippines on certain offenses or class of offenses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#50:1:A>
Concededly there are certain types of offenses which the
Philippines by its own accord has agreed to a restriction to its sovereign
right of jurisdiction under the doctrine of <unclear> 1 or 2 words </unclear> 
limitation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#51:1:A>
Thus the V F A may have diminished Philippine jurisdiction in some
aspects
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#52:1:A>
However it cannot be said that the jurisdiction of the Philippines
has altogether disappeared as it is made to appear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#53:1:A>
The only class of offenses which the Philippines under the V F A
has no jurisdiction are those relating to the security of the United States
and those punishable solely under the laws of the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#54:1:A>
In all other offenses the Philippines has either exclusive primary
or concurrent jurisdiction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#55:1:A>
The fact that the Philippines has jurisdiction in all offenses
punishable under its laws negates the claim that the V F A grants immunity to
U S personnel or accords them special or preferential treatment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#56:1:A>
Four it is a distortion to claim that the R P - U S V F A has
provisions inferior to those appearing in similar agreements of the United
States with other countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#57:1:A>
Let me just cite the provision on waiver of jurisdiction as an
example
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#58:1:A>
The U S agreements with Japan South Korea Australia and NATO
uniformly provide that quote <quote> The authorities of the state having the
primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the
authorities of the other state for a waiver of its right in cases where the
where that other state considers such a waiver to be of particular importance
 </quote> close quote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#59:1:A>
In diplomatic parlance Mr President this sympathetic consideration
clause calls for automatic waiver
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#60:1:A>
The R P negotiators thus resisted this language
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#61:1:A>
Both parties settled instead on the following <quote> Philippine
authorities will waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction in <.> ca
 </.> except in cases of particular importance to the Philippines </quote> end
of quote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#62:1:A>
We will note Mr President that the broad formulation of the
exception clause practically nullifies the mandatory meaning if any was
intended that can be given to the use of the words <mention> will waive
 </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#63:1:A>
The U S er Israeli agreement states quote <quote> Israel will waive
its primary right to exercise over <.> a </.> members of the force except in
cases where the authorities of Israel after special consideration determine
that its interests acquire require the exercise of Israeli jurisdiction
 </quote> end of quote and with Spain quote <quote> Spanish authorities except
in cases of particular importance to them will exercise their right to waive
their primary <.> ju </.> jurisdiction upon the request of U S authorities
 </quote> end of quote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#64:1:A>
The language of the R P - U S V F A provision Mr President on
waiver of jurisdiction is for all purposes the same as that of Spain and
similar to that of Israel in providing for a broad exceptional clause to the
waiver of jurisdiction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#65:1:A>
And these are better than the automatic waiver clause contained in
the agreements with Japan South Korea Australia and NATO
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#66:1:A>
The U S agreements with Egypt Honduras and the Netherlands also
contain the phrase <mention> will waive except in cases of particular
importance or exceptional importance </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#67:1:A>
Five it is argued that the V F A provisions on criminal
jurisdiction is in usurpation usurpation of the judicial power to promulgate
rules of court procedure particularly in allowing the United States military
commander to have custody of the offending U S personnel pending
investigation or trial before Philippine authorities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#68:1:A>
Mr President the V F A does not provide for a different procedure
for the custody and prosecution of U S military personnel before the
Philippine courts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#69:1:A>
It does not Mr President in any manner modify the existing rules of
criminal procedure nor does it provide for a new procedure governing such
subjects
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#70:1:A>
It is in fact consistent with and cognizant of the rules
promulgated by the Supreme Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#71:1:A>
Six the release of accused pending trial is not purely a judicial
matter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#72:1:A>
This issue has been raised in relation to the provision allowing
custody by U S military commanders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#73:1:A>
Mr President the custody and detention of accused pending trial is
a matter not within the exclusive domain of the judiciary particularly the
Supreme Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#74:1:A>
The Constitution and the rules of court provide quote <quote> All
persons except those charged with offenses punishable by <foreign> reclusion
perpetua </foreign> with evidence of <unclear> 2 words </unclear> shall
before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties or be released on
recognizance as may be provided by law </quote> that is under Article three
Section thirteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#75:1:A>
Whenever allowed pursuant to law the rules of court provide or
these rules the court may release a person in the custody in custody on his
own recognizance or that of a responsible person
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#76:1:A>
Clearly therefore Mr President the release of the accused on
recognizance is made pursuant to law and not under the rules of court alone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#77:1:A>
It is submitted that the V F A provision allowing custody of U S
military personnel accused in our jurisdiction to U S military authorities is
constitutionally and legally allowed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-029#78:1:A>
There can be no doubt that U S military authorities can qualify as
the responsible person under whom the custody of the accused may be reposed.
