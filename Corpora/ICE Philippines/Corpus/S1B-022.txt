<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#1:1:A>
Good evening and welcome to a very special edition of G M A News Report
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#2:1:A>
We 're very glad that we have uh been able to put together on this program for tonight some very distinguished people very key people who will uh figure out very prominently in the news insofar as uh <,> helping the people affected by Mount Pinatubo 's wrath cope with the crisis of this most recent crisis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#3:1:A>
You know we 've had typhoons
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#4:1:A>
We 've had earthquakes and and and uh floods
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#5:1:A>
And these are natural calamities that have somehow uhm <,> shocked this country all in in two years ' time or even uh <,> just in a year 's time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#6:1:A>
And these natural calamities somehow have drained the resources of this government the very limited resources of this government but at the same time has also brought out the best in the Filipino people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#7:1:A>
And for tonight we 're going to talk to these uh <,> very very busy people <,> and maybe talk about the process of how they are trying to uh help up in these uh relief and evacuation efforts ongoing in Metro Manila as well as in the affected areas around Mount Pinatubo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#8:1:A>
And I 'm very glad that uh Rey Punongbayan is with us here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#9:1:A>
I talked to him this morning and I asked him to sleep at about twelve noon so he can make it here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#10:1:A>
Thank you very much
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#11:1:A>
He is the person in charge of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology called PHILVOCS for short
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#12:1:A>
Minus the L PHIVOCS

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#13:1:B>
PHIVOCS

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#14:1:A>
PHIVOCS
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#15:1:A>
That 's how he pronounces it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#16:1:A>
And of course uh <,> a very good friend of mine married to my contemporary in Saint Scholastica 's uh Undersecretary of the Department of Trade and Industry we have Undersecretary Ernesto Ordo&ntilde;ez
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#17:1:A>
Thank you very much
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#18:1:A>
And we have the Undersecretary from the Department of uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#19:1:C>
Social Welfare

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#20:1:A>
Social Welfare Linda Laygo and also the governor of Pampanga Governor Bren Guiao
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#21:1:A>
Well they tell me that uh <,> my reporters tell me that they had a difficulty looking for you this morning and I told them that I had gotten in touch with you and that you 're going to be here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#22:1:A>
I 'm sure a lot of people in Pampanga are watching us tonight <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#23:1:A>
And at the same time may I at this point also tell you the people out there those who would like to extend some help to the victims
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#24:1:A>
You can uh <,> give your donations to G M A 's <mention> Operation Helping Hand </mention> uh here in Channel seven EDSA
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#25:1:A>
We receive any kind of donations food medicines uh <,> clothing blankets <,> uh not so much for cash but if you have cash we will also accept it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#26:1:A>
You can call telephone numbers nine nine six seven five three and nine six four six five zero
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#27:1:A>
Okay we will begin and very quickly the question to uh Dr Punongbayan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#28:1:A>
What happened the last three days Friday Saturday and Sunday

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#29:1:B>
Now you want that uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#30:1:A>
Yes <{> <[> just very </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#31:1:B>
<[> Friday Saturday </[> </{> and Sunday huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#32:1:A>
Friday Saturday and Sunday

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#33:1:B>
Okay that was the fourth eruption episode <{> <[> of </[> the volcano

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#34:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#35:1:B>
And it 's uh as predicted it 's gonna be long duration

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#36:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#37:1:B>
So it started at one o'clock uh Friday and ended uh thirty-six hours after that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#38:1:B>
Uh it started with a big explosion and then after so many hours we counted a total of twenty or so uh explosions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#39:1:B>
Most of these caused uh the eruption column to rise to about uh twenty to twenty-five kilometers up up there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#40:1:B>
Uh there was a complicating factor and that one was the uh passage of the typhoon and uh it 's almost over the top of uh Mount Pinatubo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#41:1:B>
The consequence of that is the lower circulation of below ten kilometers is to from the Southwest to the South to the Northeast and above that ten kilometers above the circulation is from the Northeast to the Southwest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#42:1:B>
So what it effectively did the effect of that is deliver more ash towards the Southwest and unfortunately Metro Manila is along its path so it distributed more ash on in Metro Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#43:1:B>
But aside from that it not only affected Metro Manila it also affected Palawan and all the way to Cambodia
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#44:1:B>
So so that 's the kind of uh blanket ash cloud that was created by that uh eruption

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#45:1:A>
Typhoon Diding was already predicted by PAG-ASA way back

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#46:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#47:1:A>
Was there not uh <,> also uh an opportunity for PHIVOCS to determine that there could be ashfalls as a result of the typhoon

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#48:1:B>
Well <{> <[> it 's hard to project that </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#49:1:A>
<[> That 's not within </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#50:1:A>
It 's hard to project that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#51:1:B>
It 's hard to project that because you have to determine the amount unloaded by the volcano <,> uh during that time during the passage of the typhoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#52:1:B>
And it created a wide blanket instead of just <,> uh <?> looming </?> it directly to the west it spread out <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#53:1:B>
So you have a thick blanket and at the same time a wide one so that it affected Metro Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#54:1:B>
But that 's not the only thing that happened uh because of the amount of material that was taken out from beneath the volcano there was a great void created underneath
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#55:1:B>
And we suspect that this void was compensated for by the collapse of the summit part of the volcano so that at the end a crater was formed <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#56:1:B>
So you have that as the net effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#57:1:B>
A large a large amount of material removed from underneath and collapsing of the summit part

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#58:1:A>
Are we supposed to be happy with that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#59:1:B>
Well uh I think so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#60:1:B>
Uh first uh let me tell you that uh we now have a means for determining the amount of material that was removed by the eruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#61:1:B>
So that if we measure the volume of the crater uh we shall have an indirect measure for the amount of the material uh that has to be unloaded
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#62:1:B>
Uh <,> there is such a rule that uh if you have such a volume of magma underneath ten percent of this will have to be erupted so that the eruption is over
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#63:1:B>
So we 'll we 'll have uh an idea on how how much uh uh was unloaded during the four episodes of eruption

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#64:1:A>
Just in the news tonight we were talking about uh some reports unconfirmed though uh about Mount Isarog
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#65:1:A>
Is there any possibility that it could be acting up because of Pinatubo

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#66:1:B>
No no it there 's no connection

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#67:1:A>
<indig> Wala bang koneksyon itong </indig> <.> Moun </.> Mount Unzen in in Japan

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#68:1:B>
Well that 's gonna be a long connection if you have to put a connection
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#69:1:B>
But volcanoes act <{> <[> independently </[> of each other and they have their own <?> slough </?> for going down from the magma reservoir the needed ingredient for create uh for an eruption

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#70:1:A>
<[> Independently </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#71:1:B>
So they have their own tracking system to speak of

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#72:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#73:1:B>
So uh Pinatubo can erupt and Matig which is close by will remain silent and so will Mariveles Corregidor Palay-palay and Taal

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#74:1:A>
You haven't noticed anything in Taal Volcano or Mayon

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#75:1:B>
Well uh there was <,> a coincidence of inactivity between Taal uh and uh and Pinatubo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#76:1:B>
In fact uh we were monitoring Pinatubo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#77:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#78:1:B>
Uh no Taal

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#79:1:A>
Taal

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#80:1:B>
Taal and then Pinatubo started showing signs of unrest but indirectly because uh this volcano has rested for about six hundred years and had done nothing since then
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#81:1:B>
So we had a steamblast on April second
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#82:1:B>
And uh suspecting that there is something going on we set up a seismograph just to see if there 's really something going on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#83:1:B>
And lo and behold there were many volcanic quakes recorded
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#84:1:B>
But going back to uh I 'm not I 'm not finished yet with the story of the uh the creation of the crater
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#85:1:B>
Uh so we have an indirect measure of the amount
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#86:1:B>
And I think uh we have an approximation of about <,> one cubic kilometer of magma <,> a minimum <,> from the total magma below

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#87:1:A>
Cubic kilometer

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#88:1:B>
Cubic <{> <[> kilometer </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#89:1:A>
<[> That 's how much </[> </{> in tons

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#90:1:B>
That 's one kilometer by one kilometer and one kilometer thick and that 's a lot of material
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#91:1:B>
And if you uh produce <,> ejecta uh if you double the volume so you 're talking about two cubic kilometers of uh ejecta
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#92:1:B>
That 's ash and uh <?> pumice </?> produced
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#93:1:B>
So I think uh the volcano has somehow unloaded what should be unloaded and only a fraction may remain to cause further uh eruption

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#94:1:A>
Okay we 'll get back to Dr Punongbayan and talk to our other guests right after some very very important messages <O> music </O> <&> break </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#95:1:A>
Okay you 're back with us on G M A News Reports
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#96:1:A>
We have a special report on Mount Pinatubo and we 're very glad that you 're here with us Governor Bren Guiao of Pampanga
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#97:1:A>
Is Angeles within your jurisdiction it being a city

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#98:1:D>
Well it is a private city but it is within Pampanga

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#99:1:A>
Yes of course it is but are you directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the city

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#100:1:D>
No I 'm not directly involved but I am involved in the sense that uh uh some people in Angeles come from the different towns of the province

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#101:1:A>
I see okay the question is why did Angeles seem unprepared
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#102:1:A>
They were aware that there was an imminent eruption considering that Clark had started evacuation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#103:1:A>
Angeles <,> uh obviously was unaware and was unprepared for evacuation uh

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#104:1:D>
Well uh Tina I cannot speak for the officials of Angeles City <,> but I 'd like to speak on behalf of the province
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#105:1:D>
Uh <,> we had been preparing for this uh since we had uh heard from uh Director Punongbayan about the possibility of eruption you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#106:1:D>
Our Disaster Control Council in Pampanga is adjudged as one of the best in the Philippines uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#107:1:D>
Now I 'm not saying that uh we are <,> prepared for instance uh we are now uh attending to one hundred twenty-two thousand evacuees from different parts of the province and some are coming from Olongapo and Torolles <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#108:1:D>
And I cannot imagine you know feeding one hundred twenty-two thousand people

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#109:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#110:1:D>
Undersecretary Ordo&ntilde;ez here was computing at the minimum we 'll be spending one million peso a day uh to feed uh this number of people <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#111:1:D>
Now uh <,> it 's not easy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#112:1:D>
That 's why when I am asked Tina whether <,> we are uh feeding these uh evacuees adequately my answer is <mention> no </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#113:1:D>
I don't think anyone can feed or give enough food to that number of people

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#114:1:A>
Yes yes we will go into that uh <,> logistics of uh feeding evacuees in centers that have been put up but but my original question was <,,> why why was Angeles uh unprepared
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#115:1:A>
Uh a lot of people who are now in Metro Manila I understand come came from Angeles
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#116:1:A>
They they just abandoned their homes uh late afternoon and there was no help whatsoever that came from the local government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#117:1:A>
Who was in charge at that time all this was going on

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#118:1:D>
Well as I was telling you Tina uh Angeles is a chartered city

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#119:1:A>
Yes what <.> hap </.> where 's the Mayor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#120:1:A>
Is he any

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#121:1:D>
The mayor was there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#122:1:D>
The mayor is there and uh you know I think this is not the time for me to blame anyone

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#123:1:A>
Yeah I know we 're not blaming anyone but people just wanted to find out and get an answer as to why it became the way it did

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#124:1:D>
Well I would like to believe that they were really caught flat-footed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#125:1:D>
They did not uh expect this magnitude of uh the eruption <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#126:1:D>
And uh perhaps uh as what you said they did not take a cue from <{> <[> Clark </[> Field

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#127:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#128:1:D>
Uh you will recall that somebody said that perhaps Clark Field was over-acting over-reacting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#129:1:D>
But then uh <,> uh apparently they had a basis for their uh uh moving fast enough

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#130:1:A>
Yes

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#131:1:D>
And got away from Clark Field

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#132:1:A>
Did you not advise Angeles <{> <[> about </[> the possibility of the effects of ash rain

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#133:1:B>
<[> Well </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#134:1:B>
Uh we had a

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#135:1:A>
Were they properly informed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#136:1:B>
No uh we organized a meeting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#137:1:B>
I tried to convince them that they should prepare a plan <,> uh in view of the uh forthcoming eruption

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#138:1:A>
And did they show you a plan or was this in place

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#139:1:B>
The mayor did not show up

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#140:1:A>
I see okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#141:1:A>
So going back to that statement that it would take a million pesos a day to feed about a hundred twenty <,> thousand people in Angeles in Pampanga alone

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#142:1:D>
In Pampanga
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#143:1:D>
In the entire province

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#144:1:A>
How are you getting uh I mean I know where you 're getting the money most likely from the budget releases from the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#145:1:A>
But how are you doing the the purchasing and distribution of all these relief goods

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#146:1:E>
Well aside from the initiatives of the different departments and the governors uh this morning Secretary Garrucho met the manufacturers and uh we had a very good ally in Dr Carroscoso of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office in that he promised to pay them within two days if they gave their products at manufacturer 's price with a discount
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#147:1:E>
So for example sardines which sells from six to six fifty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#148:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#149:1:E>
We got it at five twenty less ten centavos <?> per ten </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#150:1:E>
Rice uh we 're getting rice for eight pesos and twenty centavos per kilo and in the market that same rice is about ten to eleven pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#151:1:E>
And what the manufacturers like about this is that with Dr Carroscoso 's help they 'll get their money within two days

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#152:1:A>
We 're talking of Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-022#153:1:E>
Yes yes 

 </I>
