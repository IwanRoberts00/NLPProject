</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#2:1>
It is Friday morning, Alberto is back in Zamboanga, and it has
taken less than three hours on a DC-3 aeroplane, an old warrior-airplane of
Second World War vintage converted into a commercial aeroplane.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#3:1>
Not many years in the future a jet will make the flight in a few
minutes, but then they will cut off direct flights to Zamboanga from Cotabato
and redirect them to either Davao or Cebu for extra flights to make more
money for the airline, a government monopoly, which senators and cabinet
members will make into their own private milking cow, driving it to
bankruptcy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#4:1>
As a result, it will take half a day more and add flight mileage
nearly equal to a direct flight to Manila, which is twice as far, to make the
air trip that way.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#5:1>
But there are no jet flights yet, and Alberto is not thinking of this.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#6:1>
What he is thinking is: <quote> &ldquo; Well, who would believe me
if I were to tell them that in less than three hours I 've been transported
from a primitive and savage land to a civilized modern Christian city of the
South. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#7:1>
He takes a <mention> P.U. </mention> ( so-called at that time to
mean <mention> public utility car </mention> ) , an old Chevy, and is happy
that the driver recognizes him and says he used to always take passengers
from the airport terminal to his family pension house before it was closed
some years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#8:1>
Without waiting for more passengers to fill his P.U., he drives off so
as not to delay Alberto who, says the driver, will like to see his folks
without much delay.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#9:1>
The airport is not very far from his home ( <quote> Are you married,
<indig> <it> 'noy </it> </indig> ? </quote> - - <quote> No, I 'm not yet
married. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#10:1>
- - <quote> That 's good.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#11:1>
While you 're still young, better enjoy life. </quote> ) , and very
soon after going straight down San Jose road they turn left on an asphalt
street and then a minute later left again into a driveway.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#12:1>
Alberto pays his fare, gives a five-peso tip.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#13:1>
For today is special.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#14:1>
He feels nostalgic, lonely, and eager to feel at home by having
people recognize him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#15:1>
The P.U. car backs out since the driveway is too narrow for it to
turn around, and that is when he hears voices, his family 's voices, and the
car is not even out of the gate yet when he sees them: emerging from the
front concrete porch, covered with a roof that leaks even in a light drizzle;
his mother comes out of the door first, followed by his two sisters on either
side of her, almost hesitating as if they were some kind of a moth hanging
about her--and then his Papa, smiling broadly, as all other three are smiling
now, but his is a relaxed, confident smile, unlike his mother 's or sisters '
, with something sad, painful even, not really spangling, shiny. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#16:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You 've arrived, <foreign> <it> hijo </it>
</foreign> ! &rdquo; </quote> says his mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Ooo </it> </indig> , Alberto!
&rdquo; </quote> his sisters say. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Ma, &rdquo; </quote> he says, head tilted up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#19:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Ah, Cora.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#20:1>
You, too, Pilar. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#21:1>
His father Federico does not say anything.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#22:1>
He stands at the top of the stairs, looking down, smiling broadly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#23:1>
His mother kisses him on the cheek, awkwardly, and he kisses back, as
the two sisters flank him and plant their kisses awkwardly, too, on either
cheek.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#24:1>
This kind of scene has always been awkward, a little embarrassing,
for the Gonzaleses were raised not to be profuse, open, with their emotions
and feelings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#25:1>
Alberto starts up the stairs, his father looking down, still, and
he halts before him; not kissing him, or embracing, just staring back,
softly, as if any physical contact between them will burn him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#26:1>
He just says, <quote> &ldquo; Hello, Papa, &rdquo; </quote> - - his
eyes gushing with genuine affection, what his body cannot physically do, not
because it won't, but that both know that a display of emotion means shedding
one 's manhood, one 's manliness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#27:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <foreign> <it> Pues, hijo, </it> </foreign> how
are you? &rdquo; </quote> asks Federico. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#28:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <foreign> <it> Muy bien, </it> </foreign> Papa,
&rdquo; </quote> he answers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#29:1>
The two sisters tug at his traveling bag.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's all right, Cora, Pilar.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#31:1>
I can carry it myself. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#32:1>
But his sisters insist, and he lets go of the bag and a package of
dried mudfish.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#33:1>
The two walk ahead of them, crossing the floor towards his old room,
right, at the other end of the <foreign> <it> sala </it> </foreign> <&>
living room </&> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#34:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You did not tell us you were arriving today,
&rdquo; </quote> says his mother, Emma.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#35:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We could have met you at the airport. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#36:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I received your telegram last Saturday, Mama,
&rdquo; </quote> he says.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#37:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I left immediately for Cotabato the next day after
sleeping in Pikit.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#38:1>
There 's no telegraph office there. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#39:1>
The three of them sit in the <foreign> <it> sala </it> </foreign>
, Alberto on the old couch with a backrest like the streamlined tail of a
1950s Oldsmobile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#40:1>
How many times had he sat here, in the middle of the night or
two-three hours before daybreak, soused, stinking of <indig> <it> tuba </it>
</indig> <&> coconut toddy </&> ? - - <indig> <it> ay </it> </indig> , in a
very different situation--while his mother gave him a sermon for being drunk
and going out with the uncultured, impoverished gang from San Jose, a small
city-village just across the street from their own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#41:1>
He remembers one incident well, about five years ago: they had
rushed out of the Red Cross Garden--Mon, Ben and he--in their hands either a
chain, brass knuckles, or <mention> &ldquo; Rosita &rdquo; </mention> ( a
favorite weapon of the gang: a round lead, like a bob, tied at the end of a
handkerchief that one swings at an enemy just like the old knights did with
their ball-and-chain weapons.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#42:1>
It is so-called because anyone conked on the head with it goes into a
&ldquo; sweet &rdquo; sleep, knocked out of this world as one who has been
kissed by Rosita, a beautiful bar girl the gang unanimously elected, in
amusement and without the girl 's consent or knowledge, as their muse),
chasing four or five members of the <foreign> Mundo Escurro </foreign> gang
of Baliwasan.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#43:1>
The men and women who were watching the door for gatecrashers to the
public benefit dance ( the local Red Cross was raising calamity funds) fell
away, terror in their eyes, the women screaming and some crying.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#44:1>
Soused and reeling with drunkenness, Alberto had thought one of the
<foreign> Mundo Escurro </foreign> gang members had fled to the right side of
the open-air, concrete dance floor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#45:1>
Swinging his <mention> Rosita </mention> over his head, bleary-eyed,
the faces and shapes of people seeming all behind a fog or cloud, he cornered
a young man against a wall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#46:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Ha-ha, &rdquo; </quote> he shouted, threatening the
man with his <mention> Rosita </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#47:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'm going to spill your brains out on the floor,
tough guy! &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#48:1>
The fog or mist of drunkenness began to clear as he came up against
the young man, and he saw young girls cowering beside a boy of not more than
16 who, definitely, was not a <foreign> Mundo Escurro </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#49:1>
From their eyes, oohed-lips, even from the invisible sweat of their
bodies, gushed pure terror, fright, silent scream: he, Alberto, was the sole
cause, the final reason, and he felt great, chest-swelling, and mocked the
young boy as if to spill his brains out to assure himself that indeed it was
he that the young girls and the boy were so afraid of.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#50:1>
Then he spun toward the door, a small group of women facing away from
his path and bunching together against a wall, trembling, some whimpering,
and ran out to the unlit asphalted street.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#51:1>
There were young boys and girls there, who had run outside during the
ruckus, milling about, and Alberto, too drunk to see clearly under the
moonless night and the few colored lights of the Red Cross Garden, could not
make out whether the men in front or at his back were his gang or the
<foreign> Mundo Escurro </foreign> gang or just couples who had come to the
Red Cross benefit dance.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#52:1>
So, blindly, reeking with <indig> <it> tuba </it> </indig> he and his
gang had drunk earlier at the pier, a nook for chiselers, pickpockets,
drunks, the dregs of the town, he cut across the street toward the wide
playground bordered with <foreign> acacia </foreign> trees, just behind one
of the brick-and-plaster buildings of the old Petit barracks, former
headquarters of the U.S. Army Occupation Forces, over half a century ago, now
housing the city 's public library.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#53:1>
At the fringe of the playground, which would show patches of dry dead
grass like bald spots on a man 's head in the daytime, which now were
invisible in the dark, the dry patches being felt then under one 's foot by
the abrupt, smooth slump in the lawn, Alberto 's eyes fell on an empty
playground; its immediate lawn from where he and others stood lit from the
Red Cross Garden 's lights, the part from its edge to some 20 meters in half
light, and beyond it, that is, among the old, run-down brick-and-plaster
buildings and under the <foreign> acacia </foreign> trees bordering the
playground, was in complete darkness.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#54:1>
Not a soul moved in the huge playground, so it seemed, and, at the
moment, he was puzzled, confused, that nearly all who had rushed out from the
garden 's social hall during the ruckus, or left it when the benefit dance
was stopped, were standing at the edge of the playground, forming a half-moon
around it and looking out beyond at something which Alberto could not yet
see, though he felt its presence.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#55:1>
Then he saw it, or thought he saw two flitting objects in a kind of
macabre chase, running from one end of the playground to the other, and back,
before the barracks buildings, because the next moment the two objects were
gone, swallowed as it were by the darkness.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#56:1>
Indeed, there was nothing there now but darkness.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#57:1>
But the crowd kept looking toward those empty barracks buildings,
certainly not for the ghosts of American soldiers who had occupied them until
the Japanese forces overran the Petit barracks; it was as if they had
anticipated it, if not a part of their unspoken scheme, that the two figures
would again appear out of the dark and, indeed, again, the two emerged into
the half light in a macabre chase, this and that way.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#58:1>
Then he saw it again.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#59:1>
However, he was not with the crowd in anticipation, or in their
unspoken scheme, many of whom had fled when he and his gang chased the
<foreign> Mundo Escurros </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#60:1>
He was too drunk even to think, much more speculate on the appearance
of the two fighters who, from the fringe of the lawn, he could still guess
was Ben, the tallest in their gang, though both young men were tall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#61:1>
Then he knew for sure it was Ben and a <foreign> Mundo Escurro
</foreign> , because two young men stepped out of the edge of the crowd,
right, not more than two meters from him, onto the lawn. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#62:1>
One said, <quote> &ldquo; Let 's help Rudy. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#63:1>
- - <quote> <indig> Oo </indig> <&> yes </&> , &rdquo; </quote> said
the other, moving up front.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#64:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'll be the one to hit him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#65:1>
You go that way, &rdquo; </quote> he said, pointing to the other side
of the playground, <quote> &ldquo; and get behind him. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#66:1>
Now the two <foreign> Mundo Escurros </foreign> started to cut
across the playground toward the other side, where Ben and the <foreign>
Mundo Escurro </foreign> gang member were fighting.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#67:1>
Moving quietly behind the two <foreign> Mundo Escurros </foreign> ,
Alberto said, <quote> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Oy </it> </indig> , you!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#68:1>
Stay where you are!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#69:1>
Let the two of them fight by themselves. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#70:1>
The one on the left, nearest to Alberto, turned his head halfway over
his shoulder, while the other went on, his initial momentum when he decided
to assist his gangmate sort of driving him onward.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#71:1>
Although the two <foreign> Mundo Escurros </foreign> never really
separated at great length because the first man had not stopped moving
forward.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#72:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> <it> Hoy </it> </indig> , I 'm warning you,
<indig> <it> rayo </it> </indig> <&> stay away </&> ! &rdquo; </quote>
Alberto hissed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#73:1>
He could barely see the two young men in the half darkness, blurred
objects through a mist of drunkenness which hung over his head.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#74:1>
He had pulled out his <mention> Rosita </mention> and was swinging
the head-ball over his head as a warning, when the second man fell and he saw
Mon, the <mention> &ldquo; man-of-bones &rdquo; </mention> ( so-called
because he was very thin but strong), standing over the fallen <foreign>
Mundo Escurro </foreign> , kicking him relentlessly with his huge boots,
which were spiked with horseshoes, in his ribs and face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#75:1>
When Mon would be kicking someone with his boots, he sort of became
possessed and a little deranged.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#76:1>
The act of kicking a man, an enemy, with horseshoe-spiked boots, took
over his mind, his good nature, and the only way to stop him was to literally
carry him off or wait until he had spent his energy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#77:1>
The latter was preferred by their gang, because Mon often turned his
anger, madness, against the one who was stopping him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#78:1>
There was no way the second <foreign> Mundo Escurro </foreign> would
get up again, not with Mon on top of him and busting his ribs with his heavy
boots.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#79:1>
He would not stop until the young man had ceased to move or until he
was unconscious. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#80:1>
Meanwhile, the first young man was about to become a problem,
someone that must be stopped before whatever plans, sinister, would goad his
body to uncontrolled action.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#81:1>
Alberto had wavered about hitting him immediately with his <mention>
Rosita </mention> , and in that instant the <foreign> Mundo Escurro
</foreign> lunged at him with something glittering in his right hand.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#82:1>
<quote> &ldquo; He has a knife! &rdquo; </quote> thought Alberto, the
realization jolting him and reaching his <indig> <it> tuba </it> </indig> -
numbed mind.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#83:1>
<quote> <foreign> <it> &ldquo; Cono su puta madre! &rdquo; </it>
</foreign> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#84:1>
Instinctively, he swung and felt the lead-ball sink in the man 's
spinal column.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#85:1>
Through blurred eyes, with the mist of drunkenness still hovering
over his head, Alberto saw the young man abruptly stop, turn immobile and
freeze like a statue, in the infinitesimal second the <mention> Rosita
</mention> struck him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#86:1>
He threatened him with his <mention> Rosita </mention> again,
swinging the deadly weapon over his head, while saying, hissing at the young
man, <quote> &ldquo; You stay where you are, <indig> ha </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#87:1>
Let them fight fair.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#88:1>
Leave them alone, or I 'll hit you with my <mention> Rosita
</mention> again! &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#89:1>
He did not realize that the <foreign> Mundo Escurro </foreign> gang
member was paralyzed and could not move, not even a finger, even if his life
depended on it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-012#90:1>
Both feet stayed in the same position: one forward as when he lunged
at Alberto and the other stretched behind him, with only a slight bend, and
his back curved in a terribly twisted sharp arc, a hand twisted back to touch
the spot where the <mention> Rosita </mention> had struck hard and was
arrested by the weapon just before it could soothe or reach the stricken spot
which swelled into a bump, what folks call <foreign> <it> ratoncitos </it>
</foreign> , or tiny &ldquo; mice, &rdquo; on his back. </p> </I>
