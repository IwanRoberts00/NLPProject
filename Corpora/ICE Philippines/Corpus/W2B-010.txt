<h> <bold> A century of muddling through </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#2:1>
<h> <bold> The Philippines survives one hundred years of turmoil, and
the indomitable spirit of its people leads the nation into the third
millennium </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#3:1>
<bold> By Manuel L. Quezon III </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#4:1>
WE have certainly had an eventful - - and messy - - past hundred
years.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#5:1>
Since 1898 we have lived under the flags of three conquerors - -
Spain, the United States and Japan - - before obtaining independence for good
under our own banner in 1946.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#6:1>
In a century we have gone through three Spanish governors-general, 14
American military governors and civilian governors-general, three American
High Commissioners, a revolutionary <foreign> supremo </foreign> , 12
Filipino presidents ( with one more just beginning his term), one of whom was
a dictator.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#7:1>
We have lived under various Organic Acts and five constitutions, have
had four republics ( not counting Marcos 's bogus martial law <mention>
&ldquo; New Republic &rdquo; </mention> ) and a commonwealth, had seven
different legislatures that variously tried unicameralism, bicameralism, and
authoritarianism, fought wars with three great powers, been afflicted by two
major insurgencies, hatched and staged innumerable rebellions, successfully
held a peaceful people-power revolution, and endured eight coup attempts.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#8:1>
<h> <bold> Defeat </bold> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#9:1>
We went from a successful revolution against Spain to an abject defeat
at the hands of the Americans, were defeated once more by the Japanese, only
for our independence to be recognized with so many strings attached that we
have spent the past 52 years trying to give substance to that independence.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#10:1>
And yet we 're still here, as a nation and a people, to celebrate
the proclamation of our independence on June 12, 1898, an independence
genuinely but far too briefly enjoyed by ourselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#11:1>
We must have done, been doing, and continue to do, something
right for us to be where we are, right now.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#12:1>
Or have we? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#13:1>
It depends on whom you ask, I suppose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#14:1>
The story of our nation - - and the accompanying saga of our
nationhood - - has often been portrayed as a chronicle of missed
opportunities, betrayed aspirations, and incredible incompetence and venality
on the part of our leaders.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#15:1>
Our past has been presented to us as a series of dashed hopes, of a
people yearning to be free of foreign domination, only to suffer the
indignity of local tyranny. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#16:1>
It is not just our leaders who have been shown as having failed
us time and again; writers glory in revealing how we have failed ourselves,
over and over again, making Filipinos past and present accomplices to the
degradation of our nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#17:1>
We have been a people too flexible, too patient, too cheerful, and
far too generous to be worthy of surviving the rigors of nation-building; and
yet at the same time we are too jealous, too undisciplined, too eager to
muddle through, and far too easy to charm, to be capable of building a
genuine nation-state.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#18:1>
We are, our very own intellectuals - - and those who ape them - -
tell us, too effete to be capable of assuming the responsibilities of
citizenship.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#19:1>
It is not just our state, to use the terminology of Jose Almonte,
that is <mention> &ldquo; soft, &rdquo; </mention> but the Filipino people as
well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#20:1>
In stark contrast to our national self-proclaimed propensity for
anarchy and dishonesty is the sight of our neighbors, lands of consensus and
guided development, nations composed of industrious drones toiling under the
direction of enlightened despots; countries populated by people with
<foreign> per capita </foreign> incomes that dwarf ours several times over;
real nations with a genuine sense of nationhood, imbued with the sort of
nationalism that should shame us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#21:1>
<h> <bold> Many firsts. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#22:1>
And yet we are told - - perhaps to rub the sense of inferiority in
deeper - - that we have achieved so many firsts: we were the first to mount a
revolution against a colonial overlord; the first to defeat an occupying
power ( and be defeated by another one); the first to achieve political
autonomy and indeed, independence in the post-war era.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#23:1>
We were the first democracy, although not the first to be shackled by
a dictatorship, but we were the first to rise up as a people in order to
successfully kick a tyrant out of the presidential palace. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#24:1>
So which is it?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#25:1>
Are we a people and a country that has been betrayed time and again,
by foreigners and ourselves, a nation whose history is nothing less - - and
nothing more - - than a catalogue of missed opportunities and failed
attempts?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#26:1>
Should we be subscribing to some grand conspiracy theory that
accounts for our state of backwardness and political retardation?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#27:1>
Or aren't we really rather well off considering what we 've been
through? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#28:1>
I prefer to think that the latter is truer than the former. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#29:1>
We owe our being a free nation today to the very things that
others say keep us from being advanced states made in their image.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#30:1>
We owe the success - - the survival - - of the Philippines to our
lack of unity, to our propensity for bickering, to our crab mentality, to our
penchant for anarchy.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#31:1>
We are an independent-minded and free-spirited people.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#32:1>
So free-spirited that even as we were in awe of Rizal, we managed to
call him names behind his back; so independent-minded that we refused to have
one single <foreign> Supremo </foreign> , and later, an absolutist president
for our First Republic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#33:1>
We launched a <foreign> bourgeois </foreign> revolution and yet
forced the same <foreign> bourgeoisie </foreign> , when it succumbed to the
honeyed words of the Americans, to rededicate itself to independence or face
ostracism at the polls.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#34:1>
So free-spirited were we, in fact, that we found time to engage in
political intramurals even as we sought independence on the Americans '
terms; so free-spirited were we, that we thought nothing of paralyzing the
insular government as Pro split from Anti; and even as the <foreign>
Nacionalistas </foreign> built a political machine never since equaled in our
history, we saw it fit to elect independent-minded people, free-spirited
leaders to make life difficult for the Commonwealth regime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#35:1>
We were independent-minded enough to see that World War II was
about fighting fascism and defending an independence that was sure to come,
as it did come, ahead of any other colonized nation in the world; we never
hesitated to go against the flow, to buck the tide, to be for democracy when
our neighbors found it unfashionable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#36:1>
The <foreign> charisma </foreign> and rhetoric of our leaders
could only get them so far.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#37:1>
Time after time we said to them, enough is enough - - and voted them
out of office before their delusions of grandeur got the better of them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#38:1>
We thought nothing of humbling statesmen and elevating matinee idols,
just to prove who was boss; and even if guns, goons and gold managed to make
us forget to cherish our liberties, and yes, though eventually we made fools
of ourselves by finally falling to the rhetoric of our own homegrown
dictator, we came to our senses sooner than most and sent the man packing,
just as we sent many of his predecessors packing, too ( albeit a little more
gracefully). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#39:1>
We are easy to impress, but it is difficult to sustain our
interest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#40:1>
We are all wise guys, know-it-alls, and there always comes a time
when the old tunes begin to bore us, and the old antics cease to entertain
us, and we opt for something new. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#41:1>
<h> <bold> Administrations. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#42:1>
That has been the salvation of our nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#43:1>
We threw out the party of de Tavera; we elevated the <foreign>
Partido Nacionalista </foreign> , but gleefully divided it into the Liberal
and the <foreign> Nacionalista </foreign> parties, which kept reinventing
themselves to suit the popular mood.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#44:1>
When we had had enough of our <foreign> rigodon </foreign> - dancing
and Spanish-speaking politicians, we voted them out of office, too, replacing
then with the administration of a mechanic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#45:1>
<mention> &ldquo; <foreign> La Cumparsita </foreign> , &rdquo;
</mention> <mention> &ldquo; Mambo Magsaysay, &rdquo; </mention> the
<mention> &ldquo; March of the New Society, &rdquo; </mention> <mention>
&ldquo; <indig> Bayan Ko </indig> , &rdquo; </mention> every generation found
a new song to make its own; <mention> My Guy </mention> gave way to <mention>
Filipino First </mention> , which was replaced with <mention> the New Era
</mention> , itself overturned by <mention> the New Society </mention> ,
which was demolished by <mention> People Power </mention> ; and when the
allure of yellow faded, we tried the Old Boy network of <mention> Philippines
2000 </mention> and found it compared poorly to <mention> That 's
Entertainment </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#46:1>
And so we have administrations <foreign> a la mode </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#47:1>
We are just plain fickle: the healthiest democratic mood there is.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#48:1>
<mention> The EDSA experience </mention> is instructive: the
nation once referred to as composed of one son of a bitch ( Marcos) and 40
million cowards ( the rest of us) finally got the courage to reject the
dictator and all his works, thereby gaining the admiration of the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#49:1>
We gave the world the term <mention> &ldquo; people power, &rdquo;
</mention> which has been appended to accounts of the fall of tyrants from
Berlin to Budapest and Seoul to Jakarta.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#50:1>
We clung to ballot boxes with a devotion unheard of in countries with
long histories of democracy; we knelt before tanks; all the while arguing
among ourselves, distrusting our neighbors, happily ignoring the law and
rules of common decency, deluding ourselves into giving our jailer, the
dictator, the benefit of the doubt until Ninoy Aquino was shot and we
suddenly discovered that enough was enough. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#51:1>
Then we moved; and when we began to march, run, jog, fight, and
shout for our freedom, nothing could stop us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#52:1>
The reason for our ability to endure and prevail are these: we
are perpetually busy gossiping, backbiting, scheming and whining.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#53:1>
In other words, we have always had independence of heart.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#54:1>
These may be funny ways to show it, but better a free people with
freewheeling ways, than a people numbed by tyranny.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#55:1>
And when we aren't busy grumbling, when we aren't somersaulting from
manic rage to self-pitying pessimism, we have always dared to laugh, at each
other and ourselves; and when we aren't busy laughing at ourselves, we are
chuckling over the antics of those who lead us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#56:1>
<h> <bold> Different </bold> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#57:1>
We are having the last laugh; the joke is on those who said we had
been left behind by history.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#58:1>
They told us that we were the odd man out in our part of the world,
which is true, but not in the way they meant it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#59:1>
We are different because we have achieved something it will take
generations for our neighbors to enjoy: the ability to look at ourselves, and
smile.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#60:1>
Rizal taught us to laugh at the Spaniards until, in a fit of
<foreign> pique </foreign> , they had him shot.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#61:1>
Rizal and his fellow Propagandists devised and bequeathed to us the
cruelest weapon ever devised against absolute power, humor, with devastating
effectiveness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#62:1>
We even dared to use it against the self-appointed <foreign>
praetorian </foreign> guards of the Armed Forces when they tried to take our
freedom away from us. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#63:1>
Laughing at <foreign> putschists </foreign> may have gotten some
of us shot, too, just as it got some students of an earlier generation
incarcerated and tortured under Marcos for snickering <indig> &ldquo; <it> sa
ikauunlad ng bayan, bisikleta and kailangan </it> &ldquo; </indig> ; just as
it got the generation of their parents slapped and even killed under the
Japanese for saying <mention> &ldquo; <indig> <it> kabayo </it> </indig>
&ldquo; </mention> instead of <mention> &ldquo; <foreign> <it> konichi-wa
</it> </foreign> &ldquo; </mention> while bowing before the <foreign>
Kempeitai </foreign> ; just as it got Marcelo H. del Pilar and Graciano Lopez
Jaena exiled for satirizing the friars and got Rizal shot for writing
satirical novels about Philippine colonial society as a whole.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#64:1>
But whenever we have been faced with overwhelming strength, we have
had the courage to laugh. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#65:1>
The blood of martyrs and innocents, and tears of sorrow and rage
have flowed often enough, that is true.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#66:1>
But so have tears of joy, which coursed down the cheeks of Filipinos
on June 12, 1898, on July 4, 1946, on February 25, 1986, and November 24,
1992.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#67:1>
And it is the afterglow of those events that have given meaning to
our lives, and made the pain bearable when times have been tough, and our
resolve firm when we decided that enough was enough.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#68:1>
Call it muddling through, but our march to nationhood has never
halted.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#69:1>
Whatever fate has had in store for us, we have learned to just grin
and bear it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#70:1>
And when we can't bear it any longer, we go out and vote.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#71:1>
And woe to those who try to keep us from doing that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#72:1>
<h> <bold> Tragedy. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#73:1>
The tragedy of our history is that the tale of our nation has been
written by people without a sense of humor.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#74:1>
That is a delicious irony in itself: the story of our collective
lives have been written by those missing the most elementary of Filipino
virtues.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#75:1>
Rizal, poor sod, took himself far too seriously, and what is worse,
the Spaniards took him far too seriously as well.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#76:1>
And so, we revolted against the Spanish spoilsports.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#77:1>
Then the Americans came and made chumps of us, which provoked the
all-Filipino reaction of our bitterly resenting having been had; though our
attempts to wage a war on Western terms came to a suitably ludicrous end:
with Frederick Funston sitting on Emilio Aguinaldo, pinning him down as
Macabebe scouts and Funston 's friends ran pell-mell, arresting Aguinaldo 's
staff. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#78:1>
One of our handicaps is that though we love a good joke, we can't
stand jokes at our expense; and we are naturally disposed to be toadies,
though when people point that out we rebel and proclaim ourselves radicals.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#79:1>
Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera and Benito Legarda and friends, flattered
by American attention, got entranced with the idea - - planted in their heads
by William Howard Taft - - that we were little brown Americans: an idea the
Americans found rather cute but impractical, but which the <foreign> Partido
Federalista </foreign> found was a little to extreme for the voters ' taste.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-010#80:1>
And so they got a licking. </p> </I>
