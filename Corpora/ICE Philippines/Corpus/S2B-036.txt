<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#1:1:A>
Thank you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#2:1:A>
I vote <mention> yes </mention> on the V F A and in order to explain
my vote I beg permission to place the V F A in the context of contemporary
international relations present global context
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#3:1:A>
The current generation is about to enter not only a new century but
also a new millennium
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#4:1:A>
This is a very rare occasion and no generation will experience such
a moment again until after a thousand years shall have passed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#5:1:A>
Since this is a symbolic moment I humbly submit that this is a
propitious time for the Senate to pause and reflect on the V F A in the
context of the global condition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#6:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-one the Philippine Senate voted against the
extension of the R P - U S Military Bases Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#7:1:A>
From that time in the space of eight years a new world order has
emerged
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#8:1:A>
The new global power structure is no longer bipolar with the U S and
the U S S R as the two poles
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#9:1:A>
Instead the global power structure is now multipolar with the added
multiple poles of China Japan Western Europe Eastern Europe and developing
world states
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#10:1:A>
The paradigm shift from bipolarity to multipolarity has several
consequences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#11:1:A>
One is that the U S and the Soviet Union are now unable to control
their formal allies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#12:1:A>
The Philippines through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
or ASEAN can formulate its own policies and even use collective power to
influence the policies of the U S
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#13:1:A>
The Philippines on occasion could even chart our own policies with
little regard for the decisions of the U S
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#14:1:A>
Against this backdrop of international change the flow of events is
no longer predictable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#15:1:A>
And it is no longer valid to think of the Philippines vis-a-vis the
U S in cold war terms or to use the self-conscious vocabulary of vituperation
to describe the relationship of the two countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#16:1:A>
The reordering of international relations is accelerated by the
emergence of new actors on the international stage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#17:1:A>
The first generation of actors were states
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#18:1:A>
The second generation of actors today consists of multinational
corporations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#19:1:A>
When the U S military bases were here multinational corporations or
M N Cs were viewed as tools of capitalist expansion and exploitation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#20:1:A>
But today third world states including the Philippines have come to
regard M N Cs as potential providers of needed investment capital and
technology
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#21:1:A>
Other new actors include international governmental organizations
and non-governmental organizations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#22:1:A>
As a modest observer of our Senate debates on the V F A I was
sometimes left with the impression that the arguments back and forth would
have been best appreciated in a bipolar world that was based on the old
East-West conflict
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#23:1:A>
But the bipolar world has already been consigned to the dustbin of
history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#24:1:A>
We now realize that in nineteen ninety-one when the Senate voted
although the Berlin wall had fallen the meaning of the end of the cold war
was still unknown to the members of the Senate at that time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#25:1:A>
Today based on the historical time line we have begun to realize
the meaning of the end of the cold war
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#26:1:A>
For by nineteen ninety-one what had been the single state of
Yugoslavia had become five new states which are now the theater of a bloody
clash of cultures
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#27:1:A>
By nineteen ninety-two the Soviet Union had disappeared replaced by
fifteen new states of which eleven joined the so-called Commonwealth of
Independent States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#28:1:A>
With no Soviet Union there is no more cold war
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#29:1:A>
And without a cold war the Philippines is no longer in danger of
being manipulated into the status of a client state
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#30:1:A>
The Philippines is now a free agent and our <&> break in recording
 </&> which can only be those that are self-imposed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#31:1:A>
Thus the world of the erstwhile Military Bases Agreement is far
different from our present world of the Visiting Forces Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#32:1:A>
Our world is much more complicated and uncertain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#33:1:A>
The United States itself is searching for its role in the post cold
war world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#34:1:A>
It is true that the U S remains the world 's unrivalled military
superpower but at the same time the U S has the world 's largest economic
debt and suffers from serious domestic problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#35:1:A>
The world of the V F A is a changed world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#36:1:A>
Western Europe is forging a single economic market
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#37:1:A>
M N Cs are investing in the former Soviet Union Eastern Europe and
China
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#38:1:A>
The flash points of the world continue to breed civil wars national
liberation conflict and ethnic warfare
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#39:1:A>
Fundamentalist Islam insists on its own unique world rejecting both
communism and Western solutions to social problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#40:1:A>
Here in Asia developing world states including the Philippines
struggle to recover from the Asian economic crisis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#41:1:A>
Within this kaleidoscopic universe when we vote on the V F A we do
so against the background of a contest for leadership of Asia between China
and Japan fought on the battleground of economic growth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#42:1:A>
On the one hand Japan is the greatest commercial empire on earth
and the second most important power in the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#43:1:A>
If the U S refuses to maintain substantial forces in the East Asian
region Japan will take a larger defense role
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#44:1:A>
On the other hand China looks to become the world 's largest
economy by the year twenty twenty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#45:1:A>
A generation from now parts of China will be richer than Europe or
North America today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#46:1:A>
But because it is too divided it is not likely to achieve
superpower status by twenty twenty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#47:1:A>
In any event during the next century that starts next year the rest
of the world will be frightened of China
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#48:1:A>
Hence a benign U S standing alone can no longer guarantee the
security of the East Asian region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#49:1:A>
Instead the security of our region will be determined by the
relationship between Japan and China
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#50:1:A>
During this process the Philippine outlook should be shaped not by
cold war templates but by our experience as a state of the developing world
also known as the third world the South or the less developed countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#51:1:A>
I refer to the Philippine experience of a colonial past sharply
opposed social and economic classes and economic underdevelopment and poverty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#52:1:A>
We need to recognize that because of the experience we in the
Philippines tend to view the industrialized market economies of the U S as
both the cause and the perpetrator of our poverty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#53:1:A>
We also tend to feel that the current international system
relegates us to a permanently inferior position
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#54:1:A>
But this self-knowledge should not remain a bitter element of our
foreign policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#55:1:A>
Rather self-knowledge should teach us to be a conscious actor in
international politics
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#56:1:A>
Concept of National Interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#57:1:A>
One of the easiest things to do is to say that voting on the V F A
should be determined by national interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#58:1:A>
But quote <mention> national interest </mention> unquote is a
concept that has no universal meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#59:1:A>
The best that Political Science can do is to provide an enumeration
of the criteria for national interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#60:1:A>
These criteria include economics ideology power military security
and advantage morality and legality cultural affinity or even race and ethnic
issues
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#61:1:A>
Thus <mention> national interest </mention> could be defined on the
basis of either objective or subjective factors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#62:1:A>
Objective factors include economic strength military capability and
the size of the resource base
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#63:1:A>
Subjective factors include morality legality or ideology
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#64:1:A>
Whether the V F A will promote Philippine national interest depends
upon whether the person defining national interest gives preference to
objective or subjective gain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#65:1:A>
However it is also widely accepted that there are three basic
fundamental interests physical survival including territorial integrity
economic well-being and national self-determination
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#66:1:A>
At any rate it is an accepted principle of Political Science that
national interest is not so much a constant set of national objectives as it
is a changing approximation of what the leaders of a country view as
important
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#67:1:A>
When the Senate votes on the V F A we the Senators are actually
defining the national interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#68:1:A>
Like the concept of national interest the concept of national
security is also undergoing metamorphosis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#69:1:A>
In the contemporary international system the term quote <mention> 
national security </mention> unquote is no longer commonly defined as
military defense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#70:1:A>
It now includes broad-based policies to improve the standards of
the population in education health society and the environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#71:1:A>
In the post cold war era economic prosperity and welfare concerns
have become more important as national goals
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#72:1:A>
Accordingly economics is now described as quote the continuation of
power by other means unquote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#73:1:A>
Admittedly security dilemmas and territorial disputes persist in
the developing parts of the globe such as ours
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#74:1:A>
Asia Pacific currently represents a zone of turmoil in contrast to
the zone of peace in the developed world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#75:1:A>
Not only the Philippines but also other Asian states most notably
Japan are apprehensive over the recent arms build-up by China as well as the
China claim to the Spratlys
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#76:1:A>
Six states including the Philippines claim the Spratlys some sixty
rocky atolls in the South China Sea because they are believed to contain as
much as one trillion U S dollars in oil and gas deposits
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#77:1:A>
As the Spratly example shows geo-politics as the world has known it
since nineteen forty-five is dead
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#78:1:A>
The newly defined battle ground is geo-economics
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#79:1:A>
Because of the rise of regional trading blocks such as APEC or even
the proposed AFTA we in the Philippines might find that if our country is not
a member of a team we will not be able to sit at the table
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#80:1:A>
It is possible that the new international economic order a
reordering of the trilogy of aid trade and foreign investment is now dead
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#81:1:A>
The new imperialists are not necessarily the developed states like
the U S or U K but lending organizations like the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#82:1:A>
The Philippines as a Middle Power
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#83:1:A>
The Philippines is categorized as a <mention> middle power
 </mention> which is defined as a state which cannot afford the large and
flexible force structures of the major powers but which has attained a
credible minimum level of defense self-sufficiency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#84:1:A>
Naturally as a middle power we should seek to enhance our security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#85:1:A>
But while we seek to strengthen our capacity to defend ourselves
from being drawn into armed conflicts we do not have the financial means to
increase our defense self-reliance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#86:1:A>
Hence our only available option is to participate in collective or
cooperative security arrangements with other powers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#87:1:A>
The Mutual Defense Treaty is a collective security arrangement
because it proposes a collective response to aggression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#88:1:A>
By contrast the V F A is a cooperative security arrangement because
it involves bilateral confidence building and capability strengthening
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#89:1:A>
Our government pursues this strategy as dictated by the
configuration of the international system and by the level and immediacy of
perceived danger
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#90:1:A>
It should be accepted that the Philippines is not as far advanced
in the nation-building process as other states in the region such as
Australia and New Zealand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#91:1:A>
This explains why Philippine national security encompasses both
domestic stability and international security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#92:1:A>
While our national security has come to be synonymous with economic
security our country is also concerned about secessionism and the
disintegrating effects of ethnic religious or class tension
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#93:1:A>
Accordingly we should not overlook the problem of internal
stability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#94:1:A>
The need to maintain domestic security in our country is a powerful
factor in the foreign and defense policy calculations of the Estrada
administration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#95:1:A>
During the present situation the Philippines as a middle power is
compelled to adopt the common strategy followed all over the world for
reducing our vulnerabilities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#96:1:A>
This strategy is to augment our military power not just by building
up our own capabilities but by enlisting the aid of a major power
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#97:1:A>
Which major power should be our formal ally
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#98:1:A>
Following the advice of Thucydides after his study of the
Peloponnesian war we should look for an ally with whom we share a common
threat
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#99:1:A>
According to Thucydides mutual fear is the most solid basis upon
which to organize an alliance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#100:1:A>
Our present ally is the U S
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#101:1:A>
Are there compelling arguments for discarding this ally
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#102:1:A>
I have heard none that would be logical in a post cold war world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#103:1:A>
The R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty is already in place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#104:1:A>
It provides for the <?> cases <foreign> federis </foreign> </?> 
meaning the situation in which mutual commitments are to become operational
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#105:1:A>
The <?> cases <foreign> federis </foreign> </?> is set out in
Article four quote <quote> Each party recognizes that an armed attack in the
Pacific area on either of the parties would be dangerous to its own peace and
safety and declares that it would act to meet the common dangers in
accordance with its Constitutional processes </quote> unquote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#106:1:A>
Thus the <?> cases <foreign> federis </foreign> </?> is very
precise
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#107:1:A>
There has to be an armed attack
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#108:1:A>
By contrast the ensuing commitment is vague
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#109:1:A>
The U S will act in accordance with its Constitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-036#110:1:A>
Some quarters think this commitment is too vague and would prefer
what is called a hair trigger clause meaning an automatic commitment to
military action </I> 1
