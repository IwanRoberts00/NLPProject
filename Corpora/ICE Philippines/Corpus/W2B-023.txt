<h> <bold> Another new method for infertile couples </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#3:1>
SCIENCE has already gone one step further than the popular
<foreign> in vitro </foreign> fertilization ( IVF) with the introduction of
the intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#4:1>
Recent advances in reproductive medicine now offer hope to
childless couples who have tried almost everything--from popping fertility
pills to dancing to <foreign> Sta. Clara </foreign> - - in vain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#5:1>
Assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF have tremendously
improved since Louise Brown, the first so-called <mention> test tube baby
</mention> , was born in 1978. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#6:1>
Dr. Virgilio Novero said more than 100,000 test tube babies have
been born in the world over since then. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#7:1>
Although there 's a slim 20 percent chance of getting pregnant
through IVF, Dr. Gilda German-Martinez said this hasn't stopped countless
Filipino couples from spending &peso;250,000 for the procedure. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#8:1>
Novero and Martinez are two of the country 's leading
obstetricians-gynecologists ( ob-gyn) who specialize in infertility and
reproductive medicine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#9:1>
Developed in Brussels, Belgium, ICSI is said to be more reliable
than IVF in helping infertile couples fulfill their dream of having children.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#10:1>
<h> <bold> Two methods, different genders </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#11:1>
Still, the two methods aren't totally different since doctors
merely improved on IVF to arrive at ICSI.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#12:1>
Both procedures are also done outside the woman 's body and inside
the laboratory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#13:1>
In an IVF procedure, the doctor first gets the husband 's sperm
sample which later undergoes the &ldquo; sperm-washing &rdquo; technique.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#14:1>
After extracting the wife 's egg cell, the sperm sample is dropped
into it until both sperm and egg develop into an embryo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#15:1>
When the embryo reaches its fourth to eighth stage of
development, the doctor returns it to the mother 's uterus where it will
eventually develop into a full-grown baby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#16:1>
Fertilization is no guarantee, though, especially if the husband
produces sperm cells of low quality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#17:1>
Still, doctors have overcome this obstacle with the development
of ICSI. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#18:1>
Instead of dropping the sperm into the egg, doctors now inject
the sperm directly into the egg during an ICSI procedure thus dramatically
increasing the chances of fertilization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#19:1>
<quote> &ldquo; That 's why IVF is more for female factor
fertility, while ICSI is for male factor infertility, &rdquo; </quote> said
Novero. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#20:1>
<h> <bold> Less costly, more conventional </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#21:1>
Many infertile couples, though, need not undergo these extreme
measures, said Martinez.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#22:1>
Based on her experience, 90 percent of her patients can still avail
themselves of less expensive but more conventional means to have kids. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#23:1>
<quote> &ldquo; After a couple undergoes a thorough examination,
I lay down the best options for them to choose, &rdquo; </quote> she said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#24:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Why give them expensive tests when it won't help
them? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#25:1>
Based on an American medical study, 35 percent of infertility
among couples is traced to women, compared to 30 percent to men.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#26:1>
Around 25 percent is traced to both couples, while 10 percent remains
unknown. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#27:1>
Both doctors define infertility as the absence of pregnancy after
one year of unprotected sexual intercourse.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#28:1>
Couples who fall under this category should see a doctor before the
women 's biological clock runs out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#29:1>
Medical studies show that a woman 's chances of getting pregnant
declines after she reaches 37. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Many couples who visit my clinic have been
childless for four to five years, &rdquo; </quote> said Novero.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#31:1>
But there are some couples who are still hoping to hear the
pitter-patter of little feet after 20 years of trying. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#32:1>
<h> <bold> Common problems </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#33:1>
Irregular menstrual periods, infections and blocked fallopian
tubes are just some of the most common causes of infertility among women.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#34:1>
There are women, for instance, who menstruate annually, meaning they
ovulate or release an egg only once a year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#35:1>
Unless the couple makes love during this rare but brief period,
the possibility of the wife getting pregnant is, indeed, very slim. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#36:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's basically a hormonal problem which can be
corrected through medication, &rdquo; </quote> said Martinez. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#37:1>
Once the woman attains a normal menstrual cycle, the doctor
advises the couple to time their sexual intercourse during ovulation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#38:1>
This can be determined by taking the woman 's temperature or by
subjecting her to an ultrasound test. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#39:1>
Meanwhile, the leading causes of infertility among men are poor
sperm count and motility ( movement). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#40:1>
A man normally ejaculates about 50 million sperm cells during the
climax of a sex act.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#41:1>
Males with deficient sperm counts, however, cough up less than 20
million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#42:1>
According to standards set by the World Health Organization, a
man needs at least 20 million sperm cells to impregnate a woman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#43:1>
Some men are able to enrich their reproductive fluid though
medication.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#44:1>
Many, however, need to have their sperm cells &ldquo; washed &rdquo;
in a laboratory before they are artificially inseminated to a woman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#45:1>
What about in cases where sperm cells die because of their
inability to pass through a blocked <foreign> vas deferens </foreign> , the
duct that transports sperm from the testis into the urethra for ejaculation?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#46:1>
Since the area is too delicate to tinker with, men with this
condition have resorted to adopting kids or having their wives artificially
inseminated with someone else 's sperm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#47:1>
Not anymore, though.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#48:1>
Some doctors have now skipped the blocked <foreign> vas deferens
</foreign> by extracting sperm cells directly from the testicles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#49:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Recent advances in the treatment of male
infertility led one of my Belgian professors to predict the end of male
sterility by the 21st century, &rdquo; </quote> said Novero. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#50:1>
As long as their ovaries are intact, a woman with no uterus can
also defy nature by hiring a surrogate mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#51:1>
Like in an IVF procedure, the woman 's egg is extracted and
fertilized with the husband 's sperm.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#52:1>
Instead of putting the embryo back to her, however, it is placed in
the womb of another woman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#53:1>
A woman with damaged ovaries can still bear children as long as
her uterus is still intact.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#54:1>
After getting an egg from a donor, and having it fertilized by her
husband 's sperm, the embryo can now be transferred to her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#55:1>
Some of these radical procedures may be available to infertile
couples abroad.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#56:1>
But it won't be long before they catch on among child-loving
Filipinos bent on continuing their legacy here. </p> </I>

STRESS comes in monstrous forms--sleepless nights, sluggishness,
frequent bouts of colds, diarrhea, constipation, increased smoking, edginess,
overeating or anorexia, anger over small matters, or just crying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#60:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Even his officemates hate him, &rdquo; </quote>
wives complain about their stressed out husbands. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#61:2>
If three tranquilizers no longer work to calm you down, there 's
a drugless way to control stress before it controls you.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#62:2>
Acupuncture, one of the healing modalities in ancient Chinese
medicine, is based on the belief that there are patterns of energy flow, or
<foreign> <it> qi </it> </foreign> , throughout the body.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#63:2>
Blockage of the energy flow is believed to result in disease.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#64:2>
The acupuncturist can check the imbalances of <foreign> <it> qi </it>
</foreign> at points close to the skin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#65:2>
Thin metallic needles are used to prick the skin to stimulate the
areas which correspond to certain organs of the body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#66:2>
Acupuncture helps the body to heal itself, while allopathic
medicine neutralizes certain body reactions to make the person feel better.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#67:2>
Chinese medicine believes man is a spirit with a physical body
and energy.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#68:2>
Acupuncture is healing through manipulation of this energy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#69:2>
Dr. Francis Gomez, associate consultant at Intercare Healthcare
System and a proponent of acupuncture, explains: <quote> &ldquo; Man is a
microcosm of nature.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#70:2>
The interplay in nature is true in the body. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#71:2>
The characteristics of the elements--earth, water, wind, air, fire
and metal--are also found in man 's organs, he adds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#72:2>
Another concept is that the <foreign> <it> qi </it> </foreign> or
energy has two characteristics-- <foreign> <it> yin </it> </foreign> which is
feminine and cool, and <foreign> <it> yang </it> </foreign> which is hot,
dynamic and masculine.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#73:2>
These two energies complement each other and an imbalance leads to
ailments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#74:2>
Certain emotions correspond to specific organs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#75:2>
These emotions can either weaken or strengthen an organ depending on
the person 's attitude. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#76:2>
<h> <bold> Tongue </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#77:2>
Diagnosing the disease in acupuncture is similar to western
medicine--inspection, palpitation, auscultation and interview on the illness
and lifestyle of the patient 's parents.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#78:2>
Gomez looks at the patient 's tongue and feels his pulse, which
reflect the state of his internal organs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#79:2>
He looks at the tongue 's coating, color, thickness, cracks,
moisture, and teeth marks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#80:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The tongue gives a history, &rdquo; </quote> he
says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#81:2>
<quote> &ldquo; It provides me a guide. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#82:2>
Teeth marks on the tongue show that the spleen is taxed, he says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#83:2>
This in turn affects bowel movement and mucus retention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#84:2>
The doctor interprets the data in terms of pattern of imbalances
and proceeds accordingly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#85:2>
Filament needles are used to penetrate specific sites which
affect the body 's energy flow.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#86:2>
The patients will either feel pain, distentions, tingling, numbness
or warmth in the pricked areas, or the sensation will circulate through the
normal path of the <foreign> <it> qi </it> </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#87:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Chinese medicine releases the congested <foreign>
<it> qi </it> </foreign> which may have stagnated in the liver and heart,
&rdquo; </quote> says Gomez.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#88:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The good thing about Chinese medicine is that you can
channel the energy to other organs and tissues.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#89:2>
Acupuncture works to relieve stress and tension.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#90:2>
In a way, you 're relieving the mental and psychological stress.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#91:2>
More than half of the patients feel relieved and fall asleep in
the first session.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#92:2>
Gomez advises them to refrain from heavy work, taking alcohol and
exposing the punctured areas to water to avoid disrupting the energy flow.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#93:2>
<quote> &ldquo; For people under stress, there 's a physical
breakdown, &rdquo; </quote> he says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#94:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The body can't adjust to the load.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#95:2>
It 's as if you have a rope tied to the load, and you can lift only
so many kilos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#96:2>
Adding to the load are the worrying and other psychological
components. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#97:2>
This is why Gomez recommends meditation to get people to slow
down their minds.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#98:2>
Thinking too much is a major factor in draining one 's energy. </p>

<h> <bold> Massage </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#100:2>
To beat stress, Gomez recommends cutting down on red meat and
white sugar which are more <foreign> <it> yang </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#101:2>
<quote> &ldquo; When you 're stressed, there 's an excess of
<foreign> <it> yang </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#102:2>
If you take in more <foreign> <it> yang </it> </foreign> , it 's
like adding more charcoal to the stove. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#103:2>
At home, <foreign> <it> tuina </it> </foreign> or Chinese
massage is recommended if done by a member of the family.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#104:2>
It involves using pressure and massage techniques over acupuncture
points to circulate the <foreign> <it> qi </it> </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#105:2>
Gomez also suggests going out of town, swimming in the beach and
soaking in salt water which absorbs negative energy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#106:2>
Gomez studied acupuncture to go hand in hand with his medical
practice.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#107:2>
When he was in medical school he had a bad case of chronic allergic
rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and septal deviation from playing football.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#108:2>
He took decongestants and antibiotics but the former gave him
palpitations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#109:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I was sick with premature ventricular
contractions, &rdquo; </quote> he recalls.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#110:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I was too young. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#111:2>
Not taking the medicines would make Gomez so feeble that he
couldn't attend lectures or exams.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#112:2>
But he was just as ill when he took them, that they even triggered
his asthma. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#113:2>
Gomez chucked his medicines for the acupuncture needles and was
decongested after three months, with only a postnasal drip left. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#114:2>
Gomez went to China under a grant to study this healing system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#115:2>
He is founding president of the Philippine Academy of Medical
Acupuncture Inc., which aims to provide a well-rounded, holistic health care
system, including acupuncture. </p>

In addition to using their sight and hearing, dolphins are able
to sense other creatures nearby by means of a special organ in their forehead
known as the <mention> &ldquo; melon. &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#120:3>
Like bats, dolphins rely on a sound echo or &ldquo; sonar
&rdquo; navigation system.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#121:3>
Dolphins can navigate by echolocation, emitting a series of
high-pitched clicks or sound waves, which bounce off obstacles in the path.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#122:3>
In this way, dolphins can tell the size and distance of another
creature in the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#123:3>
They can warn other dolphins of danger, and can communicate over
huge distances by making sounds that travel for hundreds of kilometers
through the water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#124:3>
Among the most intelligent creatures that can be taught to
perform complicated tricks, dolphins are one of the friendliest and most
playful, the most graceful and most gentle animal toward humans. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#125:3>
Dolphins belong to the <foreign> odontocete </foreign> or
toothed group of marine mammals known as <foreign> cetaceans </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#126:3>
Unlike fish whose tails move from side to side, <foreign> cetacean
</foreign> tails ( also known as <mention> flukes </mention> ) , move up and
down.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#127:3>
Millions of years of evolution have streamlined their bodies into
the familiar torpedo shape enabling them to swim up to 45 kilometers per
hour.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#128:3>
Dolphins are generally found in warmer seas, and are often seen
accompanying ships by racing the waves and scooting in front of the bows.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#129:3>
Some observers believe that dolphins are unique among animals
because they enjoy &ldquo; free love &rdquo; with one another.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-023#130:3>
Among the most ancient of creatures, dolphins have lived
harmoniously with one another for millions of years. </p>
