<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#3:1>
<foreign> IKEBANA </foreign> continues to draw followers to its
beauty and highly stylized art form of flower arranging. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#4:1>
There are over 300 schools or forms of <foreign> ikebana
</foreign> in Japan.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#5:1>
Three of them became very popular worldwide-- <foreign> Ikenobo
</foreign> ( the most ancient), <foreign> Ohara </foreign> and <foreign>
Sogetsu </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#6:1>
These three have developed branches and study groups internationally.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#7:1>
Among all the <foreign> ikebana </foreign> schools, <foreign>
Sogetsu </foreign> offers a different approach because of its <foreign>
avant-garde </foreign> arrangements.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#8:1>
Unlike others which adhere to a rigid method of styling, <foreign>
Sogetsu </foreign> is a freewheeling art form. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#9:1>
<foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> teacher Colette Flipo, who heads the
<foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> Society of Manila, says <foreign> Sogetsu
</foreign> <foreign> ikebana </foreign> <quote> &ldquo; may be arranged
anytime, anywhere, by anyone and with any materials. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#10:1>
It aims for a contemporary effect using any convenient commodities.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#11:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They said we are the school of trash cans,
&rdquo; </quote> quips Flipo.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#12:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We always go around to see what other people 's
garden has cut that we can use.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#13:1>
Sometimes people throw things that can become our <foreign> ikebana
</foreign> with a wonderful effect. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#14:1>
<foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> can work with driftwoods, gnarled
roots, corals, weather-worn stones, dried flowers, and shells.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#15:1>
Usually, Flipo goes around Urdaneta Village in Makati, where she
lives, to check out what her neighbors ' gardens have thrown out.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#16:1>
One of the rooms in her house is already filled with twigs, dried
leaves, chicken wires, flower holders, and different kinds of vases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#17:1>
Just before this interview, Flipo showed us a dry <indig> acacia
</indig> branch, which she found the night before, spruced up with red
dracaena and spray mums, and stylishly placed on a reddish cylindrical vase.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#18:1>
It looked beautiful and refreshing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#19:1>
Flipo fuses dried items with fresh ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#20:1>
She incorporates cut-down twigs with banana leaves, heliconia, palm
leaves or dendrobium leaves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#21:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You cannot do <foreign> ikebana </foreign>
without branches.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#22:1>
It creates wonderful shapes and lines, &rdquo; </quote> she says.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#23:1>
It 's always ideal to display an <foreign> ikebana </foreign>
arrangement on top of the coffee table or at the entrance.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#24:1>
Flipo reminds one <foreign> ikebana </foreign> arrangement is enough
to brighten up the room.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#25:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If you put more, you will look like you 're having a
private exhibit, &rdquo; </quote> Flipo quips. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#26:1>
The <foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> Schol of <foreign> ikebana
</foreign> was founded by Sofu Teshigahara in 1927.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#27:1>
Teshigahara was the first Japanese to introduce <foreign> ikebana
</foreign> to the world beyond Japan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#28:1>
<foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> is a modern school of <foreign>
ikebana </foreign> which created its own style in breaking away from the
classic flower arrangement method while conforming to the classic criteria of
<foreign> ikebana </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#29:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> is known as
sculpture with flowers, using any kind of material displayed anywhere in any
circumstance, &rdquo; </quote> says Flipo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#30:1>
The <foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> School uses plants and flowers
to express vividly the experiences of the present age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#31:1>
Traditional <foreign> ikebana </foreign> is based on strict rules
and principles.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#32:1>
Depending on the style being practiced, certain stems must be cut to
particular lengths and positioned at specific angles.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#33:1>
<foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> <foreign> ikebana </foreign> is always
alive.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#34:1>
There are rules, but they are always flexible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#35:1>
<foreign> Ikebana </foreign> , Flipo explains, is not just
arranging one type of flower.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#36:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You take parts of any flower which appeal to you and
arrange them into one integrated work.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#37:1>
Depending on the way the various parts flow together, the result is
an everchanging floral kaleidoscope.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#38:1>
<foreign> Ikebana </foreign> is not just about the flowers, it 's
also about the person who arranges them. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#39:1>
<h> <bold> <foreign> Ikebana </foreign> classes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#40:1>
Flipo obtained four years of intensive <foreign> ikebana
</foreign> training at <foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> School in Tokyo.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#41:1>
She spent five years teaching <foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> in Paris
before coming to the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#42:1>
She now heads the school 's Manila branch and holds <foreign> ikebana
</foreign> classes at her home in Urdaneta Village. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#43:1>
She also gives occasional demonstrations to the Rotary Club,
<foreign> Ikebana </foreign> International Chapters, Swiss Ladies Club,
British Women 's Club and Makati Garden Club. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#44:1>
Flipo holds classes thrice a week.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#45:1>
She teaches basic techniques using textbooks ( an English version on
one side and Japanese on the other). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#46:1>
There are no limitations or strict regulations for remaining in a
basic or patternized form of arranging flowers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#47:1>
A variety of flower arrangements is expected naturally--according to
materials, the seasons and the individual. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#48:1>
Basic equipments for flower arrangement include a pair of
scissors to cut branches and flowers, flower holders and vases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#49:1>
Students begin by studying basic styles which every school
studies.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#50:1>
One is called <mention> <foreign> <it> moribana </it> </foreign>
</mention> , a method of fixing flowers on a shallow container called
<mention> <foreign> <it> suiban </it> </foreign> </mention> with the use of
<foreign> <it> Kenzan </it> </foreign> , a needlepoint holder used to fix the
materials.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#51:1>
Another style is <foreign> <it> nageire </it> </foreign> , a method
of fixing flowers in tall vases without any particular ready-made device.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#52:1>
Another basic style is freestyle.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#53:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's something they just fix themselves, combining
certain materials and look wonderful to them, &rdquo; </quote> says Flipo.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#54:1>
The harmony between the vases, the materials and the way of
putting them all together is extremely important in <foreign> Sogetsu
</foreign> , Flipo adds.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#55:1>
Certain measurements, such as the main line, diameter, height, depth
and mass lines, are also essential so everything else will be in proportion.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#56:1>
Aside from the basics, <foreign> ikebana </foreign> students are
also taught how to buy, condition and preserve the flowers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#57:1>
Flipo also encourages her students, mostly women, to be imaginative
and creative in all their works. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#58:1>
<h> <bold> Relaxing activity </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#59:1>
Flipo grew up in South Africa and studied in London.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#60:1>
She worked in an advertising agency in South Africa for 14 years and
married a French journalist.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#61:1>
They lived in China where she first encountered <foreign> ikebana
</foreign> in 1973, and went to Japan in 1976. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#62:1>
She moved to the Philippines three years ago to join her husband,
now a manager of <foreign> Agence France Presse </foreign> Manila bureau.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#63:1>
Flipo, 63, leads Manila 's <foreign> Sogetsu </foreign> Society,
which also has branches in Davao and Cagayan de Oro. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#64:1>
For Flipo, who 's been in the industry for more than a decade,
flower arranging is a very relaxing activity, aside from finding it
creatively challenging. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#65:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There 's a moment of serenity.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#66:1>

<quote> &ldquo; Flower arranging should not be a moment of

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#X69:1>
They always say the end result is less important than the pleasure
you derive from doing it.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#X70:1>
One should not be devoted merely to adjusting forms, but should
first get enjoyment from the arranging.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#X71:1>
There should be a desire to express oneself and to create, and this
must be fulfilled and set free. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#72:1>
Flipo discourages her students to spend a long time in one
particular arrangement.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#73:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There 's no great merit in working on a flower
arrangement for two hours.

</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#75:1>
If one can do it within 15 minutes, the better the result, Flipo
says.

<h> <bold> Steps in the film animation process </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#82:2>
<bold> Nestor U. Torre </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#83:2>
OUR recent articles on the making of Dream Works ' first animated
feature, <mention> &ldquo; The Prince of Egypt, &rdquo; </mention> has
interested some readers in learning more about film animation.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#84:2>
Some of them hope to end up working in the field of animation
themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#85:2>
This isn't a pipe dream, because Filipinos are believed to be
specially adept at animation, and are prized workers in many animation
studios abroad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#86:2>
What is the process involved?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#87:2>
Animation can be achieved in many ways.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#88:2>
Most cartoons are drawn by hand and the drawings representing
fractions of movement are shot frame by frame.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#89:2>
Recently, computer animation has also become popular.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#90:2>
Then there 's puppet animation, object animation and the silhouette
film. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#91:2>
For starters, let 's focus on the traditional method of
hand-drawn sequential images used in the classic animated films of old.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#92:2>
The steps involved include:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#93:2>
A <bold> good idea </bold> for the film.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#94:2>
Jerome K. Muller of <mention> Animation Magazine </mention> says that
the idea usually comes from the studio head or the director, who introduces
it to the story department for discussion and development. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#95:2>
<h> <bold> Blueprint </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#96:2>
<bold> Brainstorming sessions </bold> follow.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#97:2>
After a number of these, a full set of <bold> storyboard drawings
</bold> is completed and discussed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#98:2>
An animated feature requires thousands of storyboard drawings ( rough
sketches), which serve as a &ldquo; blueprint &rdquo; for the film in
shot-by-shot progression.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#99:2>
Bits of dialogue are often included in the drawings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#100:2>
After the storyboard is approved by the director or the studio
head, it is sent to the <bold> music department </bold> , which <quote>
&ldquo; times it out, &rdquo; </quote> setting it to appropriate beats or
rhythms.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#101:2>
Very often, the final score is done after the film is finished. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#102:2>
While music and character voices are being selected, the model
department is busy doing various <bold> character development studies </bold>
and <bold> model sheets </bold> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#103:2>
These are reproduced and used as guides by the animators and other
people working on the production. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#104:2>
The director supervises every step in the production of the
animated film.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#105:2>
He usually does a series of preliminary layout drawings which will
be passed along to the appropriate artists as reference. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#106:2>
Working mainly from the storyboards, the <bold> layout
department </bold> maps out each scene.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#107:2>
The layout man is like a stage director, camera director and set
designer.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#108:2>
He must determine the position of each character in relation to the
background during every moment of the film. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#109:2>
The <bold> detailed pencil drawings </bold> produced by the
layout department are used as a guide by the <bold> background artists
</bold> , who will collaborate with the director and a color consultant to
establish the movie 's overall mood.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#110:2>
Backgrounds are usually painted in watercolor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#111:2>
Both music and dialogue soundtracks are written on <bold>
exposure sheets </bold> which are used by the animators and cameramen.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#112:2>
The exposure sheet breaks down the sound and action, with each bit
measured in 1/24th of a second, corresponding to the number of frames flashed
on the screen each second. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#113:2>
( Early silent films ran at 16 frames per second.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#114:2>
When the optical soundtrack was introduced in 1927, that proved too
slow for accurate reproduction of voices and music, so 24 frames per second
became the standard speed for sound films.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#115:2>
The <bold> supervising animator </bold> does all the key
animation drawings, called <mention> &ldquo; <bold> extremes </bold> .
&rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#116:2>
For instance, if an action or movement takes 13 drawings to
complete, the head animator will probably do drawings no. 1 and 13. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#117:2>
<h> <bold> Key drawings </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#118:2>
The key drawings are then given to the assistant animator, who
does the <mention> &ldquo; <bold> breakdown </bold> , &rdquo; </mention>
probably drawing no. 7.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#119:2>
He may also do a further breakdown of drawings no. 4 and 10.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#120:2>
For a <bold> difficult action </bold> , the head animator may
&ldquo; rough in &rdquo; every drawing, letting his assistant do the &ldquo;
clean-ups. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#121:2>
Then, the assistant animator passes on the finished extremes and
breakdowns ( nos. 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13) to the &ldquo; <bold> inbetweeners
</bold> , &rdquo; who do the balance of the drawings ( nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9,
11 and 12) required to complete the action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#122:2>
A scene can run several minutes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#123:2>
When all the drawings for the scene are completed, they are checked
by the animator and the director.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#124:2>
After they are <bold> approved </bold> , they are &ldquo; pencil
tested, &rdquo; <bold> photographed </bold> and played back to insure their
correctness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#125:2>
After the scene passes this test, it goes to the <bold> ink and
paint department </bold> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#126:2>
&ldquo; Inkers &rdquo; go to work first, <bold> tracing </bold> each
pencil drawing onto a sheet of acetate with ink.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#127:2>
In recent years, many studios have used the <bold> Xerox </bold>
process to transfer the drawings to the cels, saving time and money. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#128:2>
After inking or Xeroxing, each cel is flipped over and <bold>
painted </bold> on the reverse side.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#129:2>
An acrylic paint specially made to stick to acetate is used.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-012#130:2>
Cels are painted on clear acetate so that the background can be seen
behind the subject. </p> </I>
