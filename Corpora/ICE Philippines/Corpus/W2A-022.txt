<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#4:1>
<it> Dessication, thermal shock, ultaviolet-irradiated seawater,
hydrogen peroxide, singly or in combination, failed to induce the tropical
abalone, <ul> <foreign> Hallotis asinina </foreign> </ul> to spawn viable
number of eggs or sperm.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#5:1>
However, natural spontaneous spawnings occurred frequently and
fertilized eggs with an average size of 180 um were obtained.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#6:1>
Trochophore larvae hatched 5.2-5.6 h after fertilization (
27.2-30.2&degee C).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#7:1>
Veliger larvae were observed 8 h after fertilization and achieved
creeping ability 30 h after fertilization.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#8:1>
Competent larvae settled within 2-3 d on prepared diatom plates and
juveniles forming the first respiratory pore were observed after 30 d. </it>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#10:1>
The tropical abalone <it> <foreign> Haloitis asinina </foreign>
</it> Linne ( 1758) is widely distributed in coastal reef zones of Southeast
Asia ( Fuze, 1981; Nateewathana and Bussarawit, 1988; Singhagraiwan and
Sasaki, 1991a, b) extending up to the subtropical and tropical regions of
Japan ( Hahn, 1989a).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#11:1>
Among the two common species of abalone reported in the Philippines (
Fuze, 1981), <it> <foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it> has the potential for
artificial propagation due to its large size and body weight.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#12:1>
Recent advances in Thailand have confirmed the potential of this
species for seed production and culture ( Singhagraiwan and Sasaki, 1991a,b).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#13:1>
A commercial abalone fishery exists in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#14:1>
In 1991, the Philippines exported to Hongkong, Japan, United States,
Singapore, Australia, and Guam 283,391 kg of processed abalone worth US
&dollar; 2,070,503 ( NSO, 1991).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#15:1>
Although demand for abalone meat remains high, the status of the
fishery, reproductive biology, and seed production trials of <it> <foreign>
H. asinina </foreign> </it> in the Philippines is not known. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#16:1>
Over the last three decades, several commercially important
abalone species in several countries have been successfully induced to spawn
by the use of ultraviolet ( uv) irradiation and hydrogen peroxide ( Hahn,
1989b).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#17:1>
In Japan and U.S. abalone species are induced to spawn on demand
throughout the year by the heavily UV-irradiated seawater technique ( Uki and
Kikuchi, 1984; Ebert and Houk, 1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#18:1>
Hydrogen peroxide may also induce gravid <it> <foreign> H. refescens,
H. coccinea canariensis </foreign> </it> , and <it> <foreign> H. discus
hannai </foreign> </it> to spawn ( Morse <foreign> et al. </foreign> 1977;
Pe&ntilde;a, 1986; Hahn, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#19:1>
However, Singhagraiwan and Sasaki ( 1991a) failed to induce spawning
in <it> <foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it> by uv-irradiated seawater;
hence, fertilized eggs and larvae were obtained solely from natural spawns.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#20:1>
This study aimed to develop seed production methods of <it>
<foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it> and to describe its larval development.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#21:1>
As successfully carried out in Japan using <it> <foreign> H. discus
hannai </foreign> </it> ( Saito, 1984), artificially produced <it> <foreign>
H. asinina </foreign> </it> seed may be used to re-stock coastal areas in the
Philippines. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#22:1>
<h> <bold> MATERIALS AND METHODS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#23:1>
<bold> Broodstock Collection and Maintenance </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#24:1>
<it> <foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it> broodstock were
collected from shallow rocky reefs of Panagatan Cays, Antique, Philippines (
Fig. 1) on January 26 and February 23, 1994.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#25:1>
Shell length and total weight ranged from 54 to 108 mm and from 34.6
to 186.8 g, respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#26:1>
Broodstock were transported to the Tigbauan Main Station of
SEAFDEC/AQD. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#27:1>
Forty-five spawners ( 10 males and 35 females) were placed in a
1-t oval fiberglass tank.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#28:1>
Water inlet and aeration system in the tank were similar to that used
at the Oyster Research Institute in Japan ( Fig. 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#29:1>
A polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) gutter cut into four 30-cm long sections
<it> <foreign> ad libitum </foreign> </it> to the spawners. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#30:1>
<h> <bold> Artificial Spawning </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#31:1>
Ripe individuals were selected and placed in separate 9-l
rectangular plastic containers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#32:1>
Gonadal maturity was assessed by gently opening a space between the
shell and the soft body.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#33:1>
Mature males have milky white testis while mature females have dark
green ovaries.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#34:1>
A gross description of gonad development followed 5 arbitrary stages,
depending on the area of the gonad covering the digestive gland.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#35:1>
Development varied from immature ( Stage 1) to full maturity ( Stage
5; Table 1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#36:1>
Only broodstock with gonads at Stages 4 and 5 were stimulated to
spawn by dessication ( 1.0-1.5 h), thermal shock ( 14-5.1&degree;C),
UV-irradiated seawater ( filtered to 5 um; 350-1, 329 mWh/1), hydrogen
peroxide ( 0.25-1.0 mM), and application of spawned abalone milt ( Table 2).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#37:1>
Dessication was carried out by removing individuals from the
water and wrapping them in moist sterile gauze for about 1-1.5 h.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#38:1>
Thermal shock consisted of raising the water temperature above
ambient using a temperature-controlled water heater and then gradually
decreasing it to ambient.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#39:1>
Artificial induction of spawning using hydrogen peroxide was carried
out using reagent grade ( 30%) chemical.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#40:1>
The animals were exposed to the hydrogen peroxide solution for 2-3 h.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#41:1>
After this period, the solution was decanted and the container
thoroughly rinsed and replaced with clean isothermal seawater.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#42:1>
This was not added when hydrogen peroxide was used because it was not
required for any specific chemical reaction ( Hanh, 1989b).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#43:1>
Ultraviolet-irradiation was carried out using 2 uv light systems in
series ( Toshiba brand; model GWO-1526 PB).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#44:1>
The amount of uv-irradiation was calculated based on the flow rate of
filtered seawater entering the uv system.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#45:1>
Lastly, spawn abalone milt was collected from the broodstock tank
released from natural spawning. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#46:1>
<h> <bold> Egg Collection and Larval Rearing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#47:1>
Fertilized eggs or trochophore larvae from natural spawnings were
collected with a special larval trap ( 80 um mesh plankton net) installed at
the drain outlet of the broodstock tank ( Fig. 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#48:1>
Collected eggs or larvae were washed with uv-irradiated seawater and
then distributed to 9-1 rectangular plastic containers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#49:1>
Trochophore larvae were kept in the same containers until the
veliger stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#50:1>
Upon observation of the operculum, eyespot, and fully formed
propodium, veliger larvae ( Fig. 4e) were transferred to a 1-t settlement
tank provided with vertically placed corrugated diatom plates.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#51:1>
Water flow was than stopped for 2-3 d to allow settlement of viable
larvae.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#52:1>
After settlement, seawater was re-introduced and maintained at a flow
rate of 550-600 L/h.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#53:1>
Larvae fed on the diatoms <it> <foreign> Navicula sp. </foreign>
</it> and <it> <foreign> Nitzschia sp. </foreign> </it> that have grown on
the plates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#54:1>
Embryonic, larval, and post-larval development stages were
monitored.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#55:1>
Morphological characteristics were based from Seki and Kan-no (
1977). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#56:1>
Water temperature and salinity ranged from 27.7 to 30.2&degree; C
and from 30 to 32 ppt, respectively. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#57:1>
<h> <bold> RESULTS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#58:1>
<h> <bold> Natural Spawnings </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#59:1>
Natural spawnings occurred several days before or during the new
moon and full moon ( Fig. 3).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#60:1>
This trend continued during the initial two months of the experiment
and spawnings were observed thereafter to occur for several days after at
least every two weeks following a lunar cycle. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#61:1>
<h> <bold> Artificial Induction of Spawning </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#62:1>
Gravid abalone did not spawn after application of dessication,
thermal stock, uv irradiation or hydrogen peroxide.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#63:1>
However, milt released by a single male induced 3 females to spawn
1.5 h after milt release.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#64:1>
Spawned eggs, however, were immature and few ( 8.1 - 16.2 x 10 <sp> 3
</sp> ) compared to about 261 x 10 <sp> 3 </sp> eggs obtained from a single
natural spawning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#65:1>
Pumping movement which usually occurs at the time of spawning was
observed when hydrogen peroxide was used as spawning stimulus.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#66:1>
However, only seawater was discharged from the respiratory pores.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#67:1>
<h> <bold> Early development </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#68:1>
Newly spawned eggs were green and measured 180 um in diameter (
Fig. 4a).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#69:1>
Cleavage began after discharge of the polar bodies and development
progressed to the morula, blastula, and gastrula stages ( Table 3).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#70:1>
Trochophore larvae hatched 5.2-5.6 h after fertilization ( Fig. 4c),
began shell secretion, and then transformed to veliger larvae 8 h
post-fertilization.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#71:1>
At this point, the apical region of the larvae was flat and the velum
completely developed with long cilia present.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#72:1>
Figure 4d shows a veliger larva before torsion of foot mass while
Figure 4e shows a veliger larva after torsion of foot mass with development
of operculum, eyespot, propodium, and cephalic tentacle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#73:1>
The veliger larvae acquired creeping ability 30 h after fertilization
( Fig. 4f) and settled on prepared diatom plates within 2-3 d ( Fig. 4g).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#74:1>
After 30 d, the first respiratory pore ( notch stage) was observed at
a shell length of 2.1 mm ( Fig. 4h). </p>

<h> <bold> DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#76:1>
<h> <bold> Artificial Spawning </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#77:1>
Dessication or complete removal of individuals from the water, in
combination with thermal shock or uv light, was not successful in inducing
<it> <foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it> to spawn.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#78:1>
Dessication alone is unreliable and has no biological significance
because abalone are subtidal and would never be subjected to this kind of
stimulus in nature, causing even the release of large quantities of immature
gametes ( Carlisle, 1945; Hahn, 1989b).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#79:1>
However, dessication in combination with UV-irradiated seawater yield
good results in other abalone species ( Uki and Kikuchi, 1984; Chen, 1984;
Han <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> 1989). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#80:1>
Thermal shock or raising the water temperature above ambient, in
combination with various stimuli, also failed to induce spawning in this
species.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#81:1>
Thermal shock alone, like dessication, is only occasionally
successful ( Leighton, 1974).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#82:1>
It causes the release of immature gametes and does not assure the
simultaneous release of viable gametes ( Carlisle, 1945; Hahn, 1989b).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#83:1>
This technique, however, was sufficient if used during the breeding
season of <it> <foreign> H. diversicolor supertexta </foreign> </it> ( Chen,
1984). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#84:1>
Although irradiation of seawater with uv light is a fast and
reliable method for induction of spawning in several species of abalone ( Uki
and Kikuchi, 1984; Ebert and Houk, 1984; Chen, 1984; Han <it> <foreign> et
al. </foreign> </it> 1989; Han, 1989b), it was not effective in inducing <it>
<foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it> in this experiment to spawn when either
singly or in combination with other stimuli.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#85:1>
Singhagraiwan and Sasaki ( 1991a) also were unable to spawn <it>
<foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it> using uv-irradiated seawater.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#86:1>
Spawning failure in this experiment may have been caused by the
higher intensity of radiation ( including ultraviolet) available in the lower
latitude due to unequal distribution of solar radiation on the earth 's
surface.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#87:1>
Tropical abalone species are already exposed to higher amount of uv
light than temperate species.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#88:1>
Difficulty in assessing fully matured and spawnable individuals by
visual inspection and the occurrence of frequent natural spawnings are also
other factors to be considered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#89:1>
Induced spawning of <it> <foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it>
can be achieved when spawned milt is used to induce gravid females.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#90:1>
Similar results were reported by Singhagraiwan and Doi ( 1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#91:1>
Adding newly-spawned gametes from either sex into the water can
trigger responsive spawning among conspecifics ( Carlisle, 1945; Morse
<foreign> <it> et al. </it> </foreign> 1977; Singhagraiwan and Doi, 1992).

<h> <bold> Natural spawning </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#93:1>
Natural spontaneous spawnings are frequently observed to occur in
the present study. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#94:1>
It was noted that <it> <foreign> H. asinina </foreign> </it>
spawns in tanks all year round with a monthly peak in October ( Singhagraiwan
and Doi, 1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#95:1>
The same authors also reported partial and multiple spawning of ripe
females. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#96:1>
<it> <foreign> H. varia </foreign> </it> , another tropical
species, also spawns the whole year round as observed in aquaria ( Fuze,
1981) and based on observations of gonads from a natural population (
Bussarawit <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> 1990). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#97:1>
<h> <bold> Early development </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#98:1>
Embryonic and larval development in <it> <foreign> H. asinina
</foreign> </it> are a function of water temperature and time since abalone
larvae do not feed before settlement ( Hahn, 1989c).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#99:1>
The length of the larval period is about 28.5 h ( 27. 7 - 30.2
&degree;C) which is considerably shorter than that for <it> <foreign> H.
rufescens </foreign> </it> with 6 d at 15 &degree C ( Ebert and Houk, 1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#100:1>
Settlement, metamorphosis, and deposition of peristomal shell mark
the transition from larval to post-larval development until formation of the
first respiratory pore ( Hahn, 1989c).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#101:1>
Settlement stage was achieved in <it> <foreign> H. asinina
</foreign> </it> after 30 h compared to 188 h for <it> <foreign> H. midae
</foreign> </it> at 20&degree; C ( Genade <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign>
</it> 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#102:1>
Table 4 shows the age and shell length of <it> <foreign> H. asinina
</foreign> </it> at formation of first respiratory pore compared with other
abalone species. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#103:1>
Our results support the strong potential of <it> <foreign> H.
asinina </foreign> </it> as an aquaculture species.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-022#104:1>
However, further studies are required to develop conditioning
techniques for captive broodstock ( e. g. proper nutrition, appropriate sex
ratio, water temperature, water quality, etc.) to allow year round and
efficient production of abalone larvae and juveniles. </p>
