<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#60:1:B>
I 'm kind of scared with the affection he gives me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#61:1:B>
I 'm not used to it I don't and I 'm scared

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#62:1:A>
What if he proposes

Aside from my <indig> barkada </indig> outside school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#68:1:A>
Uhm well he 's been confiding to me and I think that very soon in the very near future he 's going to

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#69:1:B>
Yeah that 's why I 'm avoiding because I don't want that to happen I <,> I don't want someone to get hurt and that 's why

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#70:1:A>
Well how how do you see him <,> only a friend

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#71:1:B>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#73:1:B>
No

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#74:1:A>
In the future

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#75:1:B>
I 've been thinking about that <,> and I don't think there 's a possibility

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#76:1:A>
<indig> Ay </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#77:1:B>
I 'm sorry for him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#78:1:B>
I don't want to get hurt
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#79:1:B>
I know I 'm gonna be the bad guy here because

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#80:1:A>
Well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#81:1:B>
I 'm gonna hurt him sooner or later that 's why I 'm avoiding him so as to avoid him saying to me <{> <[> that </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#82:1:A>
<[> Do you </[> </{> want me to tell him that perhaps he should not pursue you yet

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#83:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#84:1:A>
That probably <{> <[> it 's not a good time </[>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#85:1:B>
<[> If you can </[> </{> tell him <,> 'cause he might know that I told you

If you can tell him like <,> only what you think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#88:1:A>
Because we were all thinking that you 're such a perfect match <,> <{> <[> uh </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#89:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{> I 'm sorry no

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#90:1:A>
Well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#91:1:B>
I 'm sorry 'cause aside from that I don't like blockmates
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#92:1:B>
I don't like to have a relationship with blockmates 'cause <,> it 's gonna be too hectic

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#93:1:A>
He too he also talked told me that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#94:1:B>
Yeah I don't know you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#95:1:B>
I 'm sorry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#96:1:B>
I I 'm gonna hurt him and I 'm gonna turn out really really bad guy after this 'cause people are gonna be talking about me like I 'm <?> stuck </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#97:1:B>
And people are gonna be avoiding me saying why did you hurt him why did you hurt him 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#98:1:B>
But I 'm sorry I cannot do anything about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#99:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#179:1:B>
Yeah what the thing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#180:1:A>
But perhaps in the future <indig> ehem </indig> <{> <[> something </[> might develop

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#181:1:B>
<[> I don't </[> </{> know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#182:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#183:1:B>
I 've been thinking about that and I don't think there is <{> <[> any possibility </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#184:1:A>
<[> Why not </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#185:1:A>
Because you 're not over with this other guy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#186:1:B>
No I didn't even think about him <,> when I was thinking about this stuff I didn't think about him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#187:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#188:1:B>
So he 's out of the picture
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#189:1:B>
And yeah that 's why I 'm scared <,> if ever I <.> tol </.> if ever I tell him not to <indig> ganon </indig> then people might say uh because she 's not over yet <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#190:1:B>
<{> <[> And </[> and I 'm like hey you 're misinterpreting it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#192:1:B>
It 's not that I 'm not over I didn't even think about him when I was thinking about this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-018#193:1:B>
