<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#1:1:A>
Uh ladies and gentlemen good afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#2:1:A>
Uhm even before coming here I was expecting the kind of treatment I was going to get from your present President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#3:1:A>
And I have been faulted for two reasons
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#4:1:A>
The first thing I have been faulted for is my past <,> namely my having been at the Ateneo all of my scholastic life practically
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#5:1:A>
Uh the other one is of course being related to Mr Daland
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#6:1:A>
Uh the Ateneo I had a choice about my relationship to Mr Daland I had no choice about
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#8:1:A>
So I hope you will forgive me for one and tolerate me for the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#9:1:A>
Uh if you will note this is the Waldo Perfecto Hall uh the Perfectos are Ateneo boys in fact uh Mr Waldo Perfecto was a former Jesuit and uh he decided he was going to fulfill his duties to God by evangelizing and then he joined La Salle <,,> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#11:1:A>
So the process of evangelization takes uh many shapes and I suppose that 's one of the reasons why I 'm here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#12:1:A>
Enough of the nonsense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#13:1:A>
Uhm you are in Business and that is good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#14:1:A>
You are Catholic businessmen or you should be Catholic businessmen and that means it will be difficult to be good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#15:1:A>
But neither being a businessman nor being a Christian or a Catholic or even just being a decent man is a justification for anything else except being a good businessman good at being a human being and good at being a businessman and being a general member of the community
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#17:1:A>
Uh the the gentleman who introduced me I mean the gentleman who opened the the proceedings talked about uh honesty and business or the law and business
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#18:1:A>
That is so broad a field that I could write books on the darn thing and not be finished with it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#19:1:A>
But the topic given to me uh in the letter from uh Mr Daland was with regard to the corruption in government whether there is any hope of minimizing it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#20:1:A>
The title I think is rather well phrased in the sense that corruption like original sin or like the consequences of original sin cannot be abolished
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#21:1:A>
At best we can minimize hopefully we can live with it and if we are really lucky to live happily with the very little that there is insofar as graft and corruption in government will be concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#23:1:A>
Uh the issue of graft and corruption is both historical and psychological
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#24:1:A>
The political aspect of graft and corruption is <.> mer </.> merely consequential rather than caused
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#25:1:A>
The political situation can be sometimes a product rather than a cause for graft and corruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#26:1:A>
But that is neither here nor there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#27:1:A>
It is almost as easy or just as difficult to talk about which came first like many other things that which came first
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#28:1:A>
Let me then take off from a number of perspectives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#29:1:A>
Let me pull uh rank on you by age and tell you about how graft and corruption has been recorded not only in this country but elsewhere
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#30:1:A>
Let me then take you to what I do and then take you finally and hopefully to what we can do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#31:1:A>
Maybe that will make a little sense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#32:1:A>
Uhm corruption is not a uniquely Filipino weakness or fault
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#33:1:A>
Government corruption is not uniquely Filipino I hope
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#34:1:A>
Undoubtedly we have been presented many examples of honesty and uprightness in different countries and as you look at these and then look at those countries you realize that graft corruption or dishonesty whichever way you want to call it takes or manifests itself in many different forms
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#35:1:A>
We are told for example that certain third world countries are replete with graft in all aspects of society whether in government in business or in any other generally accepted form of human endeavor including schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#36:1:A>
If you don't believe in graft and corruption just go to an examination room one any day and you will find that a form a budding form to say the least of graft and corruption is in process
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#37:1:A>
And apparently I would imagine as much in La Salle as in the Ateneo corruption in class is in good health thank you <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#38:1:A>
Perhaps <mention> is in good health no thank you </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#39:1:A>
At all events uh insofar as government is concerned we are pointed to with references to honesty to Japan to the European countries and even to the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#40:1:A>
However I I submit to you that these examples are partially correct and serve only to demonstrate that these countries are filled with human beings and that for all of the external appearances of honesty they have their own forms of graft and corruption which they have carried on to a rather refined and very very prosperous enterprise
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#41:1:A>
Japan we are told is the epitome of honesty in the sense that if you lose or leave a bag or any article in the Japanese subway or on the bus you can generally find it within the same day or else in the next day at the at the headquarters or at the nearest offices of that particular bus company
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#42:1:A>
And this is probably true this is equally true of many other forms of honesty we are told in Japan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#43:1:A>
However Japan is also the place of the <foreign> Yakuza </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#44:1:A>
And the <foreign> Yakuza </foreign> has a very viable and very fruitful relationship with the National Police Department of Japan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#45:1:A>
If you want you could go into business and think about it some more there is also the problem of <w> stockholders' </w> meetings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#46:1:A>
As you might know if you don't know as you may have been told <w> stockholders' </w> meetings are places where the owners of the company both large and small may be heard may demand an explanation for certain matters of importance to the company and can demand explanations from the managers and the owner or the officers of that company
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#47:1:A>
And as you may have heard large corporations tend to be <.> te </.> tend to have raucous rowdy <w> stockholders' </w> meetings because there is always a group of stockholders that are out there to just exercise their lungs and generally give everybody else an uncomfortable time at the head table
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#48:1:A>
This apparently is something that never happens in Japan for the very simple reason that before the <w> stockholders' </w> meetings the bosses talk to the hoodlums who come to the <w> stockholders' </w> meetings so that if anybody gets rowdy he gets surrounded and very gently taken out of the premises
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#49:1:A>
If you think that 's honesty you 're welcome to it but it 's not particularly something that you would like to point out as the epitome of civilization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#50:1:A>
Needless to say there are the the scandals that have rocked the business world in Japan are current and quite often
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#51:1:A>
You can start with a large scale bribery from the sale of Lockheed aircraft Tri-Star aircraft if any of you are interested to sell to Japan a lot of kickbacks took place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#52:1:A>
And it was not the Japanese who complained
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#53:1:A>
It was discovered because the Americans had to go over the balance sheets of Lockheed Corporation and they discovered that Lockheed was paying off people in Japan in Europe and in different parts of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#54:1:A>
Graft and corruption does exist there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#55:1:A>
Graft and corruption of course exists in the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#56:1:A>
Where do you think we learned all of the ways to do things in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#57:1:A>
And they continue to do it only because of the nature of the job because of the nature of how they do things it is has to be done in a more refined way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#59:1:A>
Needless to say in Europe graft and corruption exists in its own way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#60:1:A>
There is a lot of uh <,> improprieties which take place in government which are being looked at and kept quiet about
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#61:1:A>
One of the more exciting things for you gentlemen who might indulge in the better life is that periodically in Europe <,> one of the greater and more profitable forms of corruption is to dilute or to mislabel wine <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#62:1:A>
This is uh apparently a matter of large honor for many wineries for many vineyards in Europe to be able to ascertain that a particular brand of wine does indeed come from a particular vineyard so that its quality can be maintained and the label will sell the wine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#63:1:A>
But big rackets take place big frauds are discovered periodically in this respect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#64:1:A>
Governments have fallen because of the irregularities would you believe also in public works and in other forms of government activity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#65:1:A>
So graft and corruption is not exclusively Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#66:1:A>
Neither is it a modern happening in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#67:1:A>
We have had graft and corruption for as long as there has been recorded history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#68:1:A>
And for all we know since even before recorded history there were Filipinos who were human beings we can be almost certain that graft and corruption took place at that time as well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#69:1:A>
But insofar as the Philippines is concerned you will recall that <,> recorded history in the Philippines is a western staple that is to say when Magellan came then they say recorded history in the Philippines took place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#70:1:A>
Although those of you who know better will know that even before the entry of the Spaniards before the entry of the European colonial masters there was history there was literature and there was organized government in this part of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#71:1:A>
At all events one of the difficult problems at that time was <,> how to bring into this administrative system that was known as the Philippine colony that is that was the Philippine colony of Spain efficient administration and honest administration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#72:1:A>
Remember that at that time the entry to the Philippines was motivated by two historical Spanish facts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#73:1:A>
One was religion the faith and the other was money <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#74:1:A>
There was a great competition in Europe at that time and the two maritime powers at that time were Portugal and Spain
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#75:1:A>
They divided the world by cutting <,> by drawing a a line around the entire globe and said everything on one side belongs to Spain everything on the other side belongs to Portugal 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#76:1:A>
Of course the Dutch had not heard about this and the English had not heard about this so eventually they started coming around and deciding that the lines were drawn improperly or that they were going to ignore the lines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#77:1:A>
At all events the Philippines was peculiarly situated insofar as Spain is concerned and since this is not going to be a lecture let us just <&> moves away from the microphone </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#78:1:A>
If you would look at your globe <&> draws on the board </&> that was meant to be complete circles equidistant from the center and of the same size
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#79:1:A>
If you don't think so <,> at all events uhm you must assume that Spain was on one part of the globe and the Philippines is on the other side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#80:1:A>
And the only reason why the Spaniards got to the Philippines was because somebody tried to prove that the world was round
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#81:1:A>
Somebody else went ahead of him Christopher Columbus who was a genuine Italian carrying the flag of Spain and had landed <,,> <indig> alam ko na 'yung <unclear> words </unclear> na 'yan </indig> <,,> had landed in what he thought was India was the East
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#82:1:A>
So he crossed over to the Atlantic and he went there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#83:1:A>
Of course the rest of the civilized the rest of the European world went there as well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#84:1:A>
Eventually Spain took a very dominant position on the on the matter and almost <unclear> word </unclear> of Southern the lower North America Central America and South America became Spanish or Latin dominions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#85:1:A>
In the meantime of course Magellan had crossed over gone through the Strait of Magellan down to Southeast <.> Afri </.> South uh South America went all the way up and then landed in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#86:1:A>
The point of it all was that at a certain time it was very easy it became quite easy and quite prosperous to go to Latin America
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#87:1:A>
That was where gold was Pizarro in Peru and everybody else <unclear> words </unclear> plenty of booty for Spain <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#88:1:A>
For this reason there was very little reason there was very little cause for anybody to cross the Pacific once more and come to the Philippines <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#89:1:A>
And therefore the people that came to the Philippines were a very limited group
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#90:1:A>
Generally they would be people who 'd be highly motivated <,> like priests and religious who would be burning with zeal to push forth Christ among the dark worlds of the <,> of the heathen which this part of the world was supposed to have been populated with
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#91:1:A>
But the bottom line was that unless you were highly motivated you would not come to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#92:1:A>
The other people who would come to the Philippines would be those who 'd want to advance their careers in Spain and therefore choose hazard duty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#93:1:A>
The third class was the kind of Spaniard who had to get out of Spain because he was running away from the police he was running away from the debtors or he was running away from his girlfriend 's family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#94:1:A>
And if he went <.> particul </.> if he was particularly unfortunate <,> and he went to the New World that would not be far enough
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#95:1:A>
And if he couldn't hide in the New World he would land in Vera Cruz cross over to Acapulco and then take another boat to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#96:1:A>
He had to be a fairly desperate man apparently to come to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#97:1:A>
And very desperate men are very seldom honest men
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#98:1:A>
At all events the only interesting economic activity as far as the Spanish colonialism in the Philippines is concerned was the galleon trade
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#99:1:A>
And the galleon trade was nothing else but a <unclear> 1 word </unclear> from Acapulco to Manila so that it could trade on spices silks and silver <,> with China
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#100:1:A>
And everything was a business was a matter of making percentage on what the costs were
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#101:1:A>
So the entire principal economic activity of Spain in the Philippines for a long long time was concentrated in Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#102:1:A>
And as happens to these things graft and corruption became rather rampant in Manila and in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#103:1:A>
Of course this couldn't happen for very long so what the Spanish government one of the steps that the Spanish government decided to adopt was this idea of having the incoming administration conduct an investigation on the outgoing administration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-029#104:1:A>
The assumption would be that anybody who was unhappy who had objections to the way the government had been run on the last few years would now protest and present their complaints to the incoming administration who had no connections whatever and therefore would be able to render fair judgement
