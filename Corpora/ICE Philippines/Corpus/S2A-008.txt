<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#1:1:A>
Bravo now it 's Robin Robin with the ball back to Bravo four on the shot clock they 've got to get it up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#2:1:A>
Bravo takes the three shoots the three in and out and the rebound goes to Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#3:1:A>
Tubid to Ronquillo back to Tubid now it 's Yap Yap dribble drive up to Tubid open for three passes it up for Ronquillo from the corner air ball here comes Bornancin on the fast break four on three fast break Bornancin and the pass to Bravo is bobbled with a traveling violation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#4:1:B>
And that time Bornancin made the wrong decision
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#5:1:B>
He was free for that uh lay-up but he opted to pass to Bravo <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#6:1:B>
A lot of Maroon shirts here and Bravo just bobbled the ball off the pass

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#7:1:A>
Once more still four two Ronquillo breaks it up now it 's Yap out to Tubid Tubid in a motion for three nice pass to Almenario who drew the foul and the fake

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#8:1:B>
Good ball movement that time by U E because it 's not it 's not necessary Jude for you to shoot from three point down three when you 're facing a zone defense that time good inside pass by uh Tubid to Almenario

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#9:1:A>
So quick substitution for the Maroons
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#10:1:A>
Celo goes in the ball game to replace Robin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#11:1:A>
So Coach Gregorio I guess that that 's the same thing to say uh <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#12:1:A>
Coach Gregorio saves the tall line-up for the Fighting Maroons as Almenario hits his first Gentext free throw brought to you by Gentext by Globe Handy phone the official privilege card of the U A A P games

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#13:1:B>
I think that U P can afford to put in a tall line-up like this because there 's a lot of big guys in this line-up like Bornancin and Santos even though they 're playing the forward positions they pretty much can be defense guards

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#14:1:A>
Now U P brings it across they 're down by four six two is our score Nunag pass to Santos doesn't take the shot back to Nunag now it 's Santos double team on the corner Santos cross court and open Aby Nunag for three

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#15:1:B>
The whistle off the ball Almenario came sprawling to the ground so I guess there 's a foul off on the U P Fighting Maroons or is it on <{> <[> Almenario <[> so double block time for Almenario

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#16:1:A>
<[> Almenario </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> So we see a lot of action off the ball early on

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#17:1:B>
And both teams are putting an emphasis on their defense the first few minutes of this game

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#18:1:A>
Nunag dribble drive spin move passes it to Tubid foot race is on against Bravo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#19:1:A>
Ronald Tubid slams it home

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#20:1:B>
That 's the problem if you don't have a natural point guard Nunag turning the ball over

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#21:1:A>
That brings Jomalesa off the bench Nunag out to Bornancin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#22:1:A>
Bornancin surveys the situation out to Nunag once again this is Santos from seventeen feet out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#23:1:A>
Santos fakes great defense by Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#24:1:A>
Santos forces it up draws the foul <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#25:1:A>
Here 's that high endurance slam by Ronald Tubid brought to you by high endurance Old Spice and a sure shot slam dunk from Ronald Tubid

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#26:1:B>
Maybe Ronald Tubid can also join the U A A P track and field uh meets

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#27:1:A>
For high jump for high jump <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#28:1:A>
Santos misses the first free throw
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#29:1:A>
Free throws brought to you by Gentext Globe Handy phone the official privilege card of the U A A P games <unclear> words </unclear> takes the second eight three our score
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#30:1:A>
Ronquillo brings it up for U E out to Yap
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#31:1:A>
This is Tubid now back to Yap still a zone defense by U P this is Estrada back to Ronquillo open for three 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> And they still have not solved that zone defense 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> A nice save by Almenario to Tubid and they got a fresh twenty-four second shot clock 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Ronquillo out to Tubid
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#32:1:A>
Tubid tries a stab at three still not there the long rebound back to the Warriors out to Yap
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#33:1:A>
He tries the three and he misses the three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#34:1:A>
So the shooting percentage of U E very low here they pass to Bornancin and a cut
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#35:1:A>
There 's the two free throws

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#36:1:B>
During that last possession U E missing three three pointers from three different men and Ronquillo who is normally a good outside shooter missing two three pointers

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#37:1:A>
There 's that pass to Bornancin and those were good three point shots for the Warriors actually
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#38:1:A>
I mean if you 're a coach Coach Boysie Zamar in fact they cannot fault those shots

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#39:1:B>
That time I 'm sure Coach Boysie Zamar telling Tubid and James Yap if you get shots like that again you should take it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#40:1:A>
Robson Bornancin gets the two rebounds out of Brent high school <,> second one in and out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#41:1:B>
There is a lane violation against Almenario <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#42:1:A>
Robson Bornancin only averaging five points per game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#43:1:A>
He 'll have to put that up to around double digits for U P to be a threat

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#44:1:B>
That 's not even half of his average last year Jude <,> Bornancin averaging close to twelve points a game last year

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#45:1:A>
Almenario back to Tubid eight five is our score three point lead for the Warriors Yap out to Ronquillo back to Tubid
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#46:1:A>
Now it 's Yap once again five on the shot clock spin move double team out to nobody and that 's a turn-over

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#47:1:B>
Well U E hasn't scored in the last few minutes 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Eight five is our score three-point lead for the Warriors 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> We got a time-out <O> music </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> <unclear> words </unclear> Ateneo gym
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> The U P Fighting Maroons down by three

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#48:1:B>
And every now and then alumni former players of the teams come and watch here in the U A A P and that 's a former U E player
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#49:1:B>
<unclear> name </unclear> who now plays for the Batangas Blades in the M B A

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#50:1:A>
He played for U E by the way for people who uh <O> laughter </O> who weren't sure he never mentioned his <foreign> alma mater </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#51:1:A>
Call on another foul off the ball here against Ronald Tubid <,> that 's number two on Tubid

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#52:1:B>
So two quick fouls on uh Ronald Tubid

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#53:1:A>
Correction that 's on Estrada rather so that 's number two on Estrada and he 'll be replaced and will sit on the bench
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#54:1:A>
Let 's go over to China Jocson for Gentext update <O> ten-second report from China </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#55:1:A>
Thanks China

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#56:1:B>
The important thing with that start with this start of U E Jude is their defensive start 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> U P only five points in over in almost six minutes of this game

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#57:1:A>
Well we covered one game where the U P fighting Maroons only scored two points against the blue corner against the Blue Eagles against Ateneo

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#58:1:B>
Yes indeed

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#59:1:A>
Here 's Tubid open again from the corner and U E is just shooting blanks here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#60:1:B>
That 's probably the fourth uh air ball <unclear> 1 word </unclear> for U E in this game

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#61:1:A>
Let alone the other non air ball misses <,> Ronquillo out to Tubid dribble drive inside out to Almenario from fifteen feet back to Omiping and he won't even get an opportunity to have that three-pointer down as a three-second violation is called

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#62:1:B>
That time Almenario was wide open fifteen footer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#63:1:B>
He should he should have taken that shot

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#64:1:A>
Cervantes now in the ball game replacing Santos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#65:1:A>
Jomalesa brings it up against Ronquillo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#66:1:A>
He wants Celo inside ready to double team still gets in there against Almenario now it 's Bravo back to Celo Celo takes his post move <unclear> 1 word </unclear> not there nice follow by Cervantes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#67:1:B>
So that 's that is where U P is dominant against uh U E in the previous game rebounding

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#68:1:A>
Ronquillo from the corner gets into a clearing Omiping inside to Almenario back to Omiping bobbles the ball all the way in a corner to Tubid back to Ronquillo another open three pointer another miss
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#69:1:A>
The ball is with Bornancin three on two fast break pass to Bravo this time he doesn't bobble and dunks it in

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#70:1:B>
This time Bornancin makes the right decision in that three on two fast break 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> He drops it off to the open Bravo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#71:1:A>
U P has taken the lead nine eight 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Tubid with the ball on the corner he 's gonna try another one no he 's not Omiping out to Tubid Tubid a long two pointer he was bumped no call
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> U E with the ball now it 's Jomalesa ahead to Bornancin Bornancin out to Jomalesa that 's the time for the shot clock U P up by one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#72:1:A>
Bornancin against Omiping makes his move dribble drive back to Jomalesa five on the shot clock
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#73:1:A>
Jomalesa loses control and we 've got a jump ball

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#74:1:B>
So far Jude U P winning this gamble playing their zone defense and daring the U E players to shoot from the outside

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#75:1:A>
So twenty-seven left in the first quarter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#76:1:A>
U P has taken the lead 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> We got a time out <O> music </O> Smart Zed assist from Robson Bornancin right to Mike Bravo the power to live the life you choose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#77:1:A>
Smart Zed your cell phone now

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#78:1:B>
<O> cough </O> You know Jude I was impressed with this uh Smart Zed thing because uh yesterday when I was in uh Pampanga they were sending me up to the minute updates about that uh of the Ateneo N U game

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#79:1:A>
Yes indeed so if you 've got a Smart phone I think uh the steps U A A P space news to two one one or two eight eight I think it 's two one one <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#80:1:A>
I get confused now or p k g U A A P at the same number and you 'll get uh timely updates and I think this game is also being updated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#81:1:A>
Two twenty-five left 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> U P in the lead in the ball Madarang already in the ball game for the Maroons remember he exploded for twenty-four points last time out Celo and he commits an offensive foul

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#82:1:B>
Both teams in the penalty now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#83:1:B>
Here 's Rodel Celo lowering his shoulder

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#84:1:A>
U E wants to get the lead back 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Booker with the ball out to Omiping and a foul will be called on Jomalesa

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#85:1:B>
Good Jude good substitution here by Coach Boysie Zamar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#86:1:B>
Now he has three new players to shoot from the outside in Booker Omiping and Paul Artadi

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#87:1:A>
The way they 've been shooting so far they definitely need a lot of help from the perimeter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#88:1:A>
We mentioned this before this is the kind of team that really lives and dies by how they shoot from the perimeter as Omiping hits his first Gentext free throw
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#89:1:A>
Olivar Omiping gets the second
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#90:1:A>
Jomalesa pushes it up gets past Artadi <,> Bornancin out to <.> Mas </.> Madarang inside to Celo once again cross court to Jomalesa left-handed dribble drive to Booker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#91:1:A>
Booker stole it away two on one fast break Booker nice bounce pass to Artadi for two points

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#92:1:B>
That 's the perfect way to win a two in one fast break

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#93:1:A>
Jomalesa a little bit wild here gets to Celo double team out on the corner Madarang and he picks up his pivot foot making his move

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#94:1:B>
So U E Jude scoring a lot of points here in the early going because of their defense so even though they 're struggling from the field they 're still up by three points

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#95:1:A>
Booker surveys the situation passes to Omiping Omiping to Artadi Artadi dribble drive out to Omiping to Booker
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#96:1:A>
Booker drives inside to Almenario from the baseline took it <,> four points for Almenario full court pressure once again for the Warriors <,> Madarang back to Jomalesa five-point lead now for U E less than a minute left in the first quarter and Jomalesa ill-advised three pointer there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#97:1:A>
U E now a chance to extend a five-point lead 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Artadi to Omiping back to Artadi from the corner open for three another air ball for the Warriors 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Ahead to Jomalesa it 's a foot race again Booker Jomalesa that double bounce is missed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#98:1:A>
Here comes U E with only thirty seconds left in the first quarter Artadi the pass to Booker Booker for three still misses the shot Bornancin with the board

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#99:1:B>
U E way off with their three-point attempts

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#100:1:A>
Ahead to Cervantes ther 's about a two second differential between the shot clock and the game clock 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Jomalesa against Artadi wants Celo inside gets him inside Celo cross court and there 's a foul on Masbang off the ball so we 'll have two free throws for Madarang

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#101:1:B>
You know Jude U P trying to go to Rodel Celo in the low post but Celo as we take a look at this fast break first by U E

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#102:1:A>
Smart Zed assist from Booker the power to live the life you choose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#103:1:A>
Smart Zed your cell phone now

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#104:1:B>
And Jude I was mentioning Celo does not have the footwork or the moves to attract that double teaming in the post so U E 's been doing a pretty good job at defending against Celo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#105:1:A>
Madarang gets the first Gentext free throw brought to you by Gentext by Globe Handy phone the official privilege card of the U A A P Games <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Second one on the way and he misses it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#106:1:A>
We got eight seconds to get a shot up 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Here 's Booker dribble drive against Celo that double bounce
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#107:1:A>
It 's still a miss but did he draw a foul
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#108:1:A>
Yes he did so he 's gonna have two free throws
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#109:1:A>
The foul will be on uh Celo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#110:1:A>
That 's number two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#111:1:A>
Here 's that challenge by Booker going inside

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#112:1:B>
Booker coming off the bench sure adding a lot of spark a lot of hustle for the U E Warriors

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#113:1:A>
We got a substitution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#114:1:A>
Almenario will sit on the bench replacing him will be Butel <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#115:1:A>
Arnold Booker <,> one of the spark plugs for the U E Red Warriors misses the first free throw 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#> Just four point four seconds left here in the first quarter fourteen ten is our score U E up by four <,> a big challenge to it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#116:1:A>
U P 's got four seconds here Bornancin with the ball you can see the time remaining Madarang a long three pointer and it 's off right so after ten minutes of play a five-point lead for the Red Warriors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#117:1:A>
Fifteen ten is our score
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#118:1:A>
We 'll be back with a second after these messages
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#119:1:A>
Every now and then the alumni or certain alumnus of your school this time it 's from U P

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#120:1:B>
And Jude with the uh U P uh scoring only ten points maybe they need Paulo Mendoza to suit up for this for this game <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-008#121:1:B>
This guy I know can <O> laughter </O> score thirty points uh he used to score thirty points in the U A A P

 </I>
