<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#4:1>
<it> Thirty-one <ul> <foreign> Escherichia coli </foreign> </ul>
isolates obtained from rectal swab samples of the San Lazaro Hospital,
showing resistance to SXT-TMP and C were made to conjugate with <ul>
<foreign> E. coli </foreign> </ul> SF 800 and <ul> <foreign> Salmonella
</foreign> </ul> C 568 as recipients.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#5:1>
All of the donor isolates transferred their resistance to <ul> E. coli
</ul> SF 800.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#6:1>
With <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> C 568 as recipient however, only
16 out of 31 ( 51.61%) effected transfer of drug resistance.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#7:1>
In both conjugation pairs complete transfer was demonstrated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#8:1>
The resistance marker from the donor isolates were transferred at a
frequency of 3.35 x 10-3 to 3 39 x 10-1 to the recipient <ul> <foreign>
Salmonella </foreign> </ul> C 568.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#9:1>
The multiplicity of drug resistance, their conjugative transferability
coupled with high frequency of transfer showed the occurrence of
plasmid-borne drug resistance in these <ul> <foreign> E. coli </foreign>
</ul> isolates. </it> </p>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#11:1>
The therapeutic value offered by antibiotic against bacterial
infections is very much appreciated in the field of human and veterinary
medicines...not until reports on the emergence and dissemination of multiple
antibiotic resistance, have captured much attention among health workers.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#12:1>
Results of several studies correlate the incidence of drug
resistance to the so-called selective pressure; such that prolonged exposure
to the drugs would inevitably lead to the development of resistance, with
resulting decrement in the therapeutic potential of the said drugs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#13:1>
Because of this, clinicians are now facing a dilemma on the
prescription of suitable antibiotics in the management of microbial diseases.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#14:1>
Resistance to multiple drugs is attributed to the resistance ( R)
plasmid, an extrachromosomal DNA which is transmissible to other bacterial
cell via a process called conjugation ( Willets, 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#15:1>
It is believed to be the mechanism which contributes to the acclaimed
global distribution of the resistance problem, among the bacterial milieu (
Grubb, 1990).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#16:1>
Until now, plasmid-mediated resistance continues to be a scourge in
many hospital institutions and remains a major problem in the successful
treatment and control of infections.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#17:1>
This study was therefore made to test for the conjugative
transferability of antibiotic resistance in fecal isolates of <it> <foreign>
E. coli </foreign> </it> from the San Lazaro Hospital. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#18:1>
<h> <bold> MATERIALS AND METHODS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#19:1>
<h> <bold> ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF TEST BACTERIA </bold> </h>
Fifty eight ( 58) isolates of <it> <foreign> Escherichia coli </foreign>
</it> taken from rectal swabs of patients of the San Lazaro Hospital from
October, 1992 to January, 1993 were used as test microorganisms.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#20:1>
The identity and purity of the bacterial isolates were checked by
plating them on McConkey agar and Eosin Methylene Blue ( EMB) agar. <it>
<foreign> E.coli </foreign> </it> - like lactose-fermenting colonies were
further subjected to biochemical tests such as indole and ciltrate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#21:1>
This was to distinguish <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> from
other lactose fermenters.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#22:1>
Those confirmed to be <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> were
inoculated onto nutrient agar slants and grown for 18-24 hours at 37 C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#23:1>
The cultures were stored at 4 C for further studies. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#24:1>
<h> <bold> ANTIBIOGRAM TESTING OF BACTERIAL ISOLATES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#25:1>
The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were determined
by adopting the modified-disk agar diffusion method of Kirby Bauer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#26:1>
From the stock culture, a loopful of organisms was inoculated in
brain heart infusion broth ( BHIB) and grown at 37C for 18-24 hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#27:1>
This was subcultured onto BHIB at 37 C for four hours to bring the
organisms to their log phase.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#28:1>
The growth was adjusted to the turbidity of McFarland standard number
one to approximate 3 x 10 <sp> 8 </sp> cells/ml of culture.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#29:1>
A sterile cotton swab was immersed onto standardized four-hour broth
culture and streaked onto the surface of Mueller Hinton II agar using an
overlap method of streaking.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#30:1>
Disks impregnated with known amounts of drugs were placed onto the
surface of the inoculated plate using a pair of flame-sterilized forceps.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#31:1>
These were: netilmicin ( 30 mcg), amikacin ( 30 mcg),
sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg), chloramphenicol ( 30 mcg) and
nalidixic ( 30 mcg).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#32:1>
Plates were incubated for 18-24 hours at 37 C after which the
diameters of the zones of inhibition in millimeters ( mm) were taken.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#33:1>
The results were interpreted according to the Zone Diameter
Interpretative Standards prepared by the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards ( April, 1990). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#35:1>
<h> <bold> Donor Bacteria </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#36:1>
Of the 58 test isolates identified as <it> <foreign> E. coli
</foreign> </it> from rectal swab specimens, 31 were used as donors in the
conjugation experiment with <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> SF 800
and with <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#37:1>
The donors were chosen based on their resistance to at least two of
the four drugs e. g. sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg);
chloramphenicol ( 30 mcg) and susceptibility to nalidixic acid ( 30 mcg).
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#38:1>
<h> <bold> Recipient Bacteria </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#39:1>
<it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> SF 800 ( res. nalidixic
acid resistant) and <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568 were
used as recipient strains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#40:1>
The genotype of <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568 is
not well known.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#41:1>
It was a wild strain isolated by the San Lazaro Hospital from stool
specimen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#42:1>
Recipient bacteria were shown to be sensitive in the four test drugs
( chloramphenicol-30 mcg; sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim-25 mcg;
netilmicin-30 mcg; amikacin-30 mcg). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#43:1>
<h> <bold> Conjugation Procedure </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#44:1>
Cultures of donor and recipient bacteria were grown separately in
BHIB at 37 C for 18-24 hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#45:1>
These were subcultured for another four hours at 37 C to ensure
actively-growing bacteria for the mating experiment.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#46:1>
The turbidity of broth culture was standardized to that of McFarland
number one.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#47:1>
Fifty microliters ( uL) of donor bacteria were mixed with 200 uL of
recipient organisms in brain heart infusion agar ( BHIB) plate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#48:1>
Using a sterile bent glass rod, the mixture of donor and recipient
were spread out on the surface of the agar.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#49:1>
These were incubated at 37 C for eight hours undisturbed to effect
conjugation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#50:1>
The confluent growth were harvested following the addition of 1.5 ml
sterile NSS. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#51:1>
<h> <bold> Conjugation Between Multiple-Drug Resistant <it> <foreign>
E. coli </foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> SF 800
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#52:1>
This study made use of a recipient strain lacking the restriction
( res) enzyme such as the <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> SF 800.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#53:1>
This was to facilitate the acquisition and integration of the
resistance markers from the donor bacteria.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#54:1>
This in turn helped in establishing the conjugative nature of the
resistance carried by the donor isolates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#55:1>
One hundred microliters of the bacterial emulsion of conjugative
mixture were plated onto the BHIA plate containing nalidixic acid plus
sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg/ml).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#56:1>
Colonies obtained after incubation at 37 C for 18-24 hours were
subcultured and re-examined for their antibiotic sensitivity patterns using
the disk agar diffusion method.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#57:1>
This was to check the acquired resistance to the test drugs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#58:1>
Identification of the transconjugants was based on their resistance
to nalidixic acid and to chloramphenicol or sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim or
to both chloramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#59:1>
Controls were run simultaneously to ensure the efficacy of the
prepared antibiotic plates and the check drug resistance of the donor and
recipient.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#60:1>
Controls were prepared by inoculating each of the donor and recipient
bacteria on plates containing nalidixic acid ( 30 mcg/ml) with
chloramphenicol ( 30 mcg/ml) and nalidixic acid with
sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg/ml).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#61:1>
Similarly, conjugation mixture, donor and recipient bacteria were
plated separately on each of the following drugs: nalidixic acid ( 30 mcg/ml)
sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg/ml) and chloramphenicol ( 30 mcg/ml).

<h> <bold> Conjugation Between Multiple-Drug Resistant <it> <foreign>
E. coli </foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#63:1>
All of the 31 <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> donors
which tested positive for the conjugative transfer of their drug resistance
were further made to conjugate with <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign>
</it> C 568. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#64:1>
In this procedure, the donor, recipient and transconjugant were
identified based on their ability to ferment lactose using McConkey as the
plate medium and the resistance to the test drugs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#65:1>
The failure to find <it> <foreign> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign>
</foreign> </it> strain sensitive to the four test drugs but resistant to
nalidixic acid made the researcher resort to lactose fermentation as the
marker in the selection of transconjugants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#66:1>
From the bacterial suspension of the conjugation mixture, 100 uL
were plated on McConkey agar plate with the drug to which the donor was
resistant ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> McConkey with chloramphenicol [ 30
mcg/ml] and McConkey with sulphamethoxazole-trimethprim [ 25 mcg/ml]).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#67:1>
Likewise, the same quantity of the donor and recipient bacteria were
plated separately on the selective plate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#68:1>
The choice of transconjugants was based on the failure to ferment the
lactose incorporated in the McConkey agar, hence yielding colorless colonies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#69:1>
On the other hand, donor isolates were able to ferment lactose, thus
producing pink colonies on McConkey agar with chloramphenicol.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#70:1>
<it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568 which did not
receive the resistance genes, in contrast, failed to grow on the selective
plate. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#71:1>
<h> <bold> Estimation of Conjugative Frequency </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#72:1>
The frequency of conjugative transfer of drug resistance from the
<it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> isolates to <it> <foreign> Salmonella
</foreign> </it> C 568 was determined.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#73:1>
Ten-fold serial dilution were made from the conjugation mixture (
composed of donor recipient and transconjugant population).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#74:1>
One hundred microliters ( uL) of each dilution were plated onto each
of the three McConkey agar plates with the drugs to which the recipient was
converted to resistance ( e.g. chloramphenicol [ 30 mcg/ml] or
sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim [ 25 mcg/ml]).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#75:1>
This allowed estimation of the number of transconjugant population (
recipient which has acquired the resistance factor). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#76:1>
In the same manner, 100 uL of the conjugation mixture were plated
onto each of the three McConkey agar without any drugs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#77:1>
This permitted growth of donor <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign>
</it> ( pink colonies) and the <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it>
recipient population ( colorless colonies which received and which did not
receive the resistance factor). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#78:1>
Conjugation frequency was taken as the ratio of the number of
colony-forming units of transconjugant to the number of colony-forming units
of recipient population. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#79:1>
<h> <bold> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#80:1>
Results of the antibiotic susceptibility tests show that out of
the 58 <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> isolates examined, 36 (
62.07%) were resistant to at least one of the five test drugs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#81:1>
Figure 1 shows the resistance phenotypes of the isolates categorized
into four groups in terms of their response patterns against the test drugs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#82:1>
The biggest group composing of <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign>
</it> isolates resistant to both C and SXT - TMP ( 53.45%).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#83:1>
This is followed by isolates showing susceptibility to all of the
test drugs ( 37.9%).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#84:1>
Another group showed resistance to C only ( 6.9%) and only ( 1.7%) of
the isolates showed resistance to SXT-TMP. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#85:1>
Fig. 2 shows that among the five drugs tested, the highest
percentage resistance was to C ( 35 out of 58 or 60.34%), followed by SXT-TMP
( 32 out of 58 or 55.17%).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#86:1>
This level of resistance may be due to the rampant use of these two
drugs, in the household and hospital.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#87:1>
Medical records of the patient from whom the microorganisms were
isolated revealed that most of them were exposed to the said drugs either by
self-medication or as prescribed by their doctors.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#88:1>
Practices which underscore the vital role played by the selective
pressure on the rise of the resistant microorganisms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#89:1>
Of the 58 <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> isolates, none
were shown to be resistant to NET, AK or NA, results which were similar to
those resorted by Hryniewiez <foreign> et al. </foreign> ( 1993). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#90:1>
Fig. 3 illustrates the results of the conjugation experiments
between the two mating partners: <it> E. coli </it> to <it> <foreign> E. coli
</foreign> </it> SF 800 and <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> to <it>
<foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#91:1>
In terms of the percentage of donor isolates that effect transfer of
drug resistance, this study showed that conjugative transferability is higher
in mating partners involving same species as in the case of <it> <foreign> E.
coli </foreign> </it> to <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> SF 800 (
Fig. 3a) than in pairs of different genera such as <it> <foreign> E. coli
</foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568 ( Fig.
3b).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#92:1>
These results are similar to those reported by Arnold ( 1986) and
Levine ( 1973).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#93:1>
All of the 31 <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> donor isolates
transferred their drug resistance to <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it>
SF 800.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#94:1>
Result obtained in this study is significantly higher than to those
observed by similar study made by Zaldivar ( 1991) and Sta. Ana ( 1989). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#95:1>
However, in conjugation pair involving <it> <foreign> E. coli
</foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568,
transfer of drug resistance was seen in 16 out of 31 isolates tested.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#96:1>
As shown in this study, the multiple drug resistance genes harbored
by the <it> E. coli </it> isolates were conjugative, that is, it can be
passed on to other species which cohabit the same site such as <it> <foreign>
E. coli </foreign> </it> which constitutes a great part of the gut flora; and
more seriously to a pathogen such as <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign>
</it> C 568.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#97:1>
Following successful conjugative transfer, this will convert a
previously drug sensitive strain to resistance with this acting
simultaneously as reservoir and as potential donor of the resistance genes to
other organisms.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#98:1>
The implication is more serious in case of <it> <foreign> Salmonella
</foreign> </it> converted to resistance since this will make treatment of
salmonellosis or enteric fever more difficult. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#99:1>
Fifteen of the <it> <foreign> E. coli </foreign> </it> isolates
did not transfer any resistance to <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it>
C 568. Whether <it> <foreign> Salmonella </foreign> </it> C 568 is restricted
minus or not, is not well known.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#100:1>
It is possible that resistance factor was not modified by the
recipient cell to prevent its degradation by restriction enzymes in the
recipient.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#101:1>
Modification is accomplished by the methylation of specific DNA
sequence ( Taylor, 1981).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#102:1>
The ability of the recipient bacterium to accept or integrate
foreign DNA such as in conjugative gene transfer, is therefore, controlled by
the restriction and modification system ( Zubay, 1987).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-024#103:1>
This is a way of protecting the cell against invading DNA of other
cell. </p> </I>
