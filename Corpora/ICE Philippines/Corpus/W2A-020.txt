<h> <bold> Net Social Benefits of Emigration from the Perspective of
the Source Country: Do Overseas Filipinos Really Benefit the Philippines?
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#2:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#3:1>
Who benefits from international migration?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#4:1>
From the perspective of individual migrants, migration to a
higher-wage setting represents an unambiguous improvement in their individual
welfare <foreign> ex-ante </foreign> ( even though unexpected poor working
conditions abroad can obviously reduce welfare <foreign> ex-post </foreign>
<fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#5:1>
Every year, thousands of migrants leave the Philippines for the first
time, either temporarily or permanently.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#6:1>
Philippine migrants are evidently attracted by higher wages overseas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#7:1>
However, does the Philippines, as a whole, benefit from emigration?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#8:1>
The answer to this question is not self-evident, especially as the
social net benefits of emigration are not clear.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#9:1>
Depending on the answer, governments may decide to limit or encourage
emigration of their nationals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#10:1>
But whose welfare should governments protect?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#11:1>
The definition of a reference group whose welfare governments are
mandated to maximize is not always clear.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#12:1>
If the reference group is comprised of migrants overseas, then
governments in source countries will attempt to protect them if their
<foreign> ex-post </foreign> welfare is threatened by conditions overseas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#13:1>
However, this assistance is limited by the sovereignty of the host
countries where migrants choose to go.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#14:1>
Although active legal protection of their nationals can be provided
by source countries, even international organizations face the constraints of
sovereign host states.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#15:1>
Organizations such as the International Labor Office ( ILO) have
supported several normative instruments concerning the welfare of migrant
workers, but these have not all been ratified by host countries ( ILO
1992:26-32). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#16:1>
On the other hand, the reference group may be the important and
sizeable group composed of the non-migrant population which remains within
the jurisdiction of source countries.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#17:1>
Within the borders of a source country, intervention on emigration is
the government 's prerogative.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#18:1>
However, the type of intervention depends on whether or not
emigration improves the social welfare of non-migrants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#19:1>
If it does, the government can decide to follow an active or a
passive role.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#20:1>
But if emigration reduces social welfare, governments may choose a
closed-door policy.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#21:1>
Any policy intervention should be carefully considered because some
policies may exacerbate costs rather than increase benefits to non-migrants.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#22:1>
When considering the social welfare of residents, a number of
benefits and costs should be taken into account.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#23:1>
Migrants ' remittances to families at home represent significant
benefits to the country, but emigration entails costs as well.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#24:1>
These social costs can be expressed in terms of output losses, the
magnitudes of which will depend on the structure of the source economy (
whether the economy faces labor surplus or not) and the type of emigrants (
whether they are skilled or unskilled).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#25:1>
Moreover, remittances may represent increased income inequality
within the country, which adds costs in terms of greater inefficiency or
unfairness in the source economy.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#26:1>
Other social costs are harder to evaluate, but their magnitude should
also be assessed ( for example, the cost of broken families). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#27:1>
To shed light on these issues and concerns, this article
discusses the effects of emigration on the non-migrant population in the
Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#28:1>
It has four major sections.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#29:1>
Section 1 reviews the factors affecting international migration and
provides an overview of trends in emigration, the profile of migrants, and
their remittances.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#30:1>
Section 2 examines the benefits and costs of international migration,
focusing first on official remittances, followed by a discussion of other
benefits and costs of emigration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#31:1>
Section 3 discusses the government 's role in regulating
international emigration from the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#32:1>
Broad policy recommendations conclude the paper. </p>

<h> <bold> INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION: &ldquo; PUSH AND PULL &rdquo;
FACTORS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#34:1>
<h> <it> &ldquo; Push &rdquo; factors: Sluggish domestic labor
markets </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#35:1>
Emigration reflects labor market conditions in the source
country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#36:1>
Conditions of slow growth in employment and of low wages, which
indicate strong &ldquo; push &rdquo; factors and impel international
migration, continue to describe labor market conditions in the Philippines in
the 1990s.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#37:1>
Philippine labor markets have undergone very limited structural
transformation away from agriculture into high-productivity sectors such as
manufacturing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#38:1>
In 1960, employment was concentrated in agriculture and
manufacturing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#39:1>
By 1990, agriculture and other lower-productivity sectors, such as
community services and wholesale trade, had already surpassed manufacturing
as the most important job provider.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#40:1>
Manufacturing accounted for 12.1 percent of all employed workers in
1960, but in 1990 its share of all employed workers was down to only 9.7
percent ( NSO 1992a:Table 15.3a).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#41:1>
In addition, trends in real wages also appear disappointing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#42:1>
In the early 1990s, real wage rates had not recovered to levels
prevalent during the early 1970s as a result of a stagnant economy and the
rapid increase in the size of the labor force ( World Bank 1993:373). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#43:1>
In the period under consideration, domestic absorption of labor
deteriorated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#44:1>
First, unemployment rates ( above 10 percent) were on the rise at the
beginning of this decade.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#45:1>
With almost one-fifth of the labor force underemployed, the figure
for underemployment also pointed at the same direction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#46:1>
The unemployment rate is associated with emigration because this
figure, especially in developing countries, not only indicates weak labor
markets but also the conditions faced by a more skilled and urban labor
force.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#47:1>
This labor force represents the pool of potential international
migrants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#48:1>
Between 1975 and 1993, urban unemployment rates in the Philippines
suggest a positive relationship with emigration flows ( see Figure 1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#49:1>
However, while Philippine domestic conditions have encouraged the
willingness to emigrate among its citizens, host countries ultimately decide
which level of immigration to take, depending on their own economic and
political circumstances. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#50:1>
<h> <it> &ldquo; Pull &rdquo; factors: changing international labor
markets </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#51:1>
Since the beginning of this century, Philippine participation in
international labor markets has increased and has followed the global trend
from more settlement-oriented to more temporary emigration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#52:1>
Most of the permanent migration of Philippine nationals has been to
the United States, a migration stream with a long history of labor movements
that started prior to Philippine independence in 1946.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#53:1>
In the early 1900s, prohibition in the U.S. against importing labor
from China or Japan caused the U.S. to turn to the Philippines to alleviate
labor shortages in Hawaii, Guam, and California.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#54:1>
After the Second World War, Filipino workers were recruited for the
reconstruction of U.S. bases in the Pacific.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#55:1>
In 1965, the U.S. relaxed restrictions on race and country of origin,
making a wider variety of skilled labor from the Philippines eligible for
emigration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#56:1>
By 1980, Filipino migrants in the U.S. had already become the largest
Asian community and the second most prosperous community among the
foreign-born. <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#57:1>
A decade later, the number of Filipinos in the U.S. had doubled,
representing 60 percent of all overseas Filipinos ( Rodriguez and Horton,
forthcoming).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#58:1>
Today, the U.S. still represents the most important destination of
permanent migrants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#59:1>
In general, however, the existence of quotas for immigrants in
host countries keeps permanent migrants a small, selected group.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#60:1>
In 1991, only nine percent of all emigrants left the Philippines as
permanent migrants, and this category also showed a low average annual growth
of 2.3 percent between 1981 and 1991 ( NSO 1992a; see Figure 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#61:1>
Contract labor, on the other hand, began in the 1970s to open new
opportunities for migration, at least temporarily, and this flow of migrants
has since expanded.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#62:1>
Land-based and sea-based migrants posted a growth rate of 7.7 percent
per annum between 1981 and 1991 ( Figure 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#63:1>
In 1991, of the 665,000 emigrants, 72 percent were land-based while
19 percent were sea-based contract workers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#64:1>
The latter group also accounted for almost one-fifth of the total
crew population worldwide ( POEA 1991:9). <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#65:1>
Contract labor stems from increases in labor demand, and the
location of this demand determines where migrants go.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#66:1>
Lower oil prices and the consequent recession in the Gulf states have
slowed down migration to that region; nonetheless, in absolute terms it has
remained the most important destination for Philippine contract workers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#67:1>
The number of migrants to the Gulf states grew 4.7 percent per year
only on average between 1981 and 1991, while Asia-bound migrants increased
annually by 18.6 percent on average during the same period.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#68:1>
Booming Asian economies attracted almost 20 percent of the total
outflow of migrants in 1991.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#69:1>
If present trends continue, by the end of the century the numbers of
Philippine migrants leaving for Asian countries would equal those leaving for
the Gulf states. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#70:1>
<h> <it> &ldquo; Pull &rdquo; factors: wages overseas </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#71:1>
What draws migrants to leave the Philippines in large numbers?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#72:1>
Undoubtedly, incomes overseas which are significantly higher than in
the Philippines represent a strong incentive to move.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#73:1>
Gross National Product ( GNP) <foreign> per capita </foreign> in Hong
Kong, Japan, Saudi Arabia, or Singapore are at least 10 times that of the
Philippines, where GNP <foreign> per capita </foreign> in 1992 was
US&dollar;770 only ( World Bank 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#74:1>
But GNP figures may only be crude estimates of potential earnings
abroad.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#75:1>
To arrive at a better gauge of wage differentials, comparisons were
made involving reported actual wages of male migrants by occupation in Japan,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, as well as in the Philippines using unpublished data
on contracts from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration ( POEA).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#76:1>
As shown in Figure 3, the data suggest that, after accounting for
some characteristics such as occupation, host country, and sex, wages of
Philippine migrants are substantially higher overseas ( up to 16 times more)
than wages in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#77:1>
Of these countries, Japan offers the highest wages in all
occupational categories except transport operators.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#78:1>
However, because these figures do not take into account cost of
living in the host country, the differentials may actually be lower.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#79:1>
Within occupations, entertainers show the highest wage levels;
domestic helpers, some of the lowest.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#80:1>
But such occupations as that of domestic helpers may more likely be
supplemented by in-kind wage benefits ( i.e., room and board) which are not
included in these figures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#81:1>
Note that, as migrants need not have the same occupation in the
Philippines and abroad, occupational shifts are known to occur and further
reveal migrants ' ability to maximize their expected individual gains through
migration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#82:1>
Moreover, when wages of male workers are compared to women 's wages,
the data show that, in some cases, female workers are paid more than their
male counterparts, a reflection, in part, of the characteristics of the host
country 's labor market.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#83:1>
In Saudi Arabia, for instance, the fact that local women do not
participate in the labor force results in a relative scarcity that translates
into higher wages for foreign female workers compared with wages for foreign
male workers, at least in some occupations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#84:1>
Over time, wages have been declining in some host countries, and
immigration controls have increased in others.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#85:1>
Despite increases in individual costs of migration, the number of
migrants is on the rise, indicating the strong dominance of push factors in
Philippine migration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#86:1>
For instance, lower oil prices produced an economic recession during
the 1980s in Saudi Arabia.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#87:1>
This recession, together with stiffer competition from other
migrant-sending countries, seems to have driven wages downwards.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#88:1>
Figure 4 shows that between 1982 and 1990 current GDP <foreign> per
capita </foreign> in Saudi Arabia dropped by more than half ( database from
the World Bank).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#89:1>
Instead of a reduction in immigrant flows of contract workers, during
this period annual arrivals from the Philippines in this oil-producing state
remained at around 200,000 ( Central Department of Statistics of Saudi
Arabia, several issues).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#90:1>
Furthermore, in Japan migration costs have risen for some types of
migrants; immigration controls have also been tightened.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#91:1>
However, illegal immigration has not been eradicated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#92:1>
In May 1993, Japanese authorities reported that 12 percent of all
foreigners with expired visas were Philippine nationals, equivalent to 35,700
illegal migrants ( Morita and Sassen 1993). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#93:1>
While contract labor appears to be a temporary phenomenon, the
period of stay can be extended, which reveals the migrants ' desire to reap
more benefits from their overseas employment.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#94:1>
One-year contracts appear to be quite common, but migrants tend to
stay longer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#95:1>
Since 1983, when the POEA started to record the number of rehires
among land-based migrants, the data indicate a high proportion of &ldquo;
repeaters": on average, 45.3 percent of all contract workers were rehires
between 1983 and 1993 ( POEA 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#96:1>
Also, micro-level data give evidence of extended stays overseas.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#97:1>
Rodriguez and Horton ( forthcoming) find that the average stay
overseas was 3.2 years for returnees and 2.7 for migrants who were still
away.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-020#98:1>
The unfinished stay of the latter suggests the existence of
maximizing behavior on the part of individual migrants, i.e., there is an
optimal time to return given migrants ' preferences in gains from overseas
employment. </p> </I>
