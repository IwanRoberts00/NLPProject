<bold> BOOK REVIEW </bold>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#2:1>
by <@> Amelia Santos </@>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#3:1>
<it> The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts </it>
by Maxine Hong Kingston is a story affixed with an exotic setting but dealing
with the same subjects as mainstream American feminist literature,
specifically the <mention> &ldquo; Me and Mom &rdquo; </mention> genre.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#4:1>
The book is seen as powerful because it confronts many aspects of
women 's lives which are repeated in different cultures, especially the
male-female relationship and attitudes to that relationship within the
community.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#5:1>
It struggles with Maxine 's identity that reflects her gender ideas.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#6:1>
Wanting to show the audience that she is a woman warrior she conveyed
this in many ways by telling stories that reflected her personality or in her
mind, her gender. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#7:1>
From the very beginning of her life story <mention> &ldquo; No
Name Woman, &rdquo; </mention> Maxine reveals her childhood as a female.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#8:1>
She shows the reader her mother 's feelings about her Aunt who became
a family outcast for getting pregnant out of wedlock and finally drowned
herself and her newborn baby in the family well after the villagers raided
her house.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#9:1>
Brave Orchid reveals this family secret to the young Maxine on the
onset of the daughter 's menstruation to caution her against sexual
indiscretion. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X10:1>
Quoted from the story, <quote> <it> &ldquo; Don't let your father
know I told you.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X11:1>
He denies her.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X12:1>
Now that you have started to menstruate, what happened to her could
happen to you.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X13:1>
Don't humiliate us.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X14:1>
You wouldn't like to be forgotten as if you had never been born.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X15:1>
The villagers are watchful. &rdquo; </it> </quote> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#16:1>
At the same time, the mother attempts to suppress this story by
forbidding the daughter to repeat it and instead wants her to be the perfect
female for their family.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#17:1>
On the other hand, the man who got her aunt pregnant wanted to kill
her because he did not want to be embarrassed, when actually it was his fault
just as much hers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#18:1>
This story is very intense and detailed, which starts the book
off with the introduction of how women were portrayed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#19:1>
This is frightening for Maxine because she feels that women are being
watched to make sure they are behaving the right way for society.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#20:1>
Maxine shows us how she overcomes this womanly figure by turning into
a warrior thru the second story <mention> &ldquo; White Tigers &rdquo;
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#21:1>
Based on the author 's version, the swordswoman studies martial arts
from a pair of mysterious old couples and leads a peasant uprising against
the tyrannous emperor.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#22:1>
After she decapitates the misogynist baron who has exploited her
village and ruined her childhood, the swordswoman renounces her masculine
power and returns to the traditional roles of daughter-in-law, wife, and
mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#23:1>
The swordswoman describes how her parents carve their names,
vows, and grievances on her back.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#24:1>
Although undeniably an act of bodily mutilation, this act represents
a coveted family acknowledgment for Chinese and Chinese American women.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#25:1>
Furthermore, the description of the script on the swordswoman 's back
is a deliberate combination of physical and artistic beauty: <quote> <it>
&ldquo; If an enemy should flay me, the light would shine through my skin
like lace. &rdquo; </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#26:1>
Through this revision of the chant of Fa Mu Lan, Maxine vicariously
satisfied her urgent desire for family recognition.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#27:1>
Her gender has also proven to herself that she could be whoever she
wants whether society agrees with her or not.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#28:1>
It tells us that people need to be proud of their gender whether male
or female and as individuals we do not need to live up to anyone 's
expectations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#29:1>
We represent our own gender but in our own individual ways.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#30:1>
Maxine states many times how she rebelled against ideas for women.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#31:1>
<X> For example <quote> <it> &ldquo; There is an outward tendency in
females, which meant that I was getting straight A 's for the good of my
future husband 's family, not my own.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X32:1>
I did not plan to ever have a husband.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X33:1>
I would show my mother and father and the noisy emigrant villagers
that girls have no outward tendency.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X34:1>
I stopped getting straight A 's. &rdquo; </it> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#35:1>
The mother 's story, <mention> &ldquo; Shaman, &rdquo; </mention>
is situated in the middle of the book.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#36:1>
After the deaths of her two children born in China, Brave Orchid
decided to leave her uneventful life in New Society Village to study medicine
in Canton, the capital of the province.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#37:1>
In the medical school Brave Orchid earns outstanding grades and
summons the courage to challenge the &ldquo; Sitting Ghost".

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#38:1>
She volunteers to spend a night in a haunted room in the dormitory,
reportedly defeats the ghost as it tries to attack her, and mobilizes the
whole student body to participate in her exorcising ritual.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#39:1>
In a sense Brave Orchid 's struggle with the Sitting Ghost is a
symbolic battle with the limits of traditionalism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#40:1>
<mention> The Woman Warrior </mention> not only chronicles the
development of the daughter Maxine but also the mother 's struggle for
self-definition.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#41:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Shaman &rdquo; </mention> records Brave Orchid 's
passage from a traditional woman to a respectable woman doctor.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#42:1>
Back in her village Brave Orchid uses her intelligence to establish
herself as a renowned doctor.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#43:1>
Like the fantastic swordswoman portrayed earlier, Brave Orchid
<quote> <it> &ldquo; has gone away ordinary and come back miraculous, like
the ancient magicians who came down from the mountains. &rdquo; </it>
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#44:1>
Brave Orchid 's American daughter, must also learn to fight the
&ldquo; ghosts &rdquo; in her life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#45:1>
<mention> The Woman Warrior </mention> is subtitled <mention> Memoirs
of a Girlhood among Ghosts </mention> . <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X46:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Once upon a time, &rdquo; </quote> the narrator
recalls, <quote> &ldquo; the world was so thick with ghosts, I could barely
breathe; I could hardly walk, limping my way around the White Ghosts and
their cars. &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#47:1>
Her world of ghosts is a result of other parents ' refusal to
acknowledge America and of the shadowy residues of the Chinese past in her
childhood and young-adult life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#48:1>
The narrator protests, <quote> <it> &ldquo; whenever my parents said 'home,'
they suspended America.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#49:1>
They suspend America.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#50:1>
They suspended enjoyment, but I did not want to go to China. &rdquo;
</it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#51:1>
Significantly, the reconciliation of the mother and the daughter in
<mention> &ldquo; Shaman &rdquo; </mention> occurs after the mother finally
gives up on the ancestral homeland.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#52:1>
<quote> <it> &ldquo; We have no more China to go home to, &rdquo;
</it> </quote> the aged Brave Orchid laments.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#53:1>
The daughter, now released from the &ldquo; ghost &rdquo; of China
that was imposed on her as a child, can freely acknowledge her matrilineal
age: <quote> <it> &ldquo; I am really a Dragon, as she is a Dragon, both of
us born in the dragon years.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#54:1>
I am practically a first daughter of a first daughter. &rdquo; </it>
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#55:1>
In <mention> &ldquo; At the Western Palace, &rdquo; </mention>
the fourth section of <mention> The Woman Warrior </mention> , Maxine tells
the story of her other silent Chinese aunt, Moon Orchid.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#56:1>
It is the only third-person narrative in the book, and it
communicates the hazard of poor adjustment to American reality.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#57:1>
Moon Orchid, whose name alludes to her insubstantial presence, has
lived comfortably in Hong Kong on the subsidy from her husband.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#58:1>
Through the manipulation of Brave Orchid, Moon Orchid is forced to
come to America to collect her lost husband and claim her title of first
wife.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#59:1>
After she discovers her thoroughly Americanized husband, a successful
doctor who has remarried, to an English-speaking wife, Moon Orchid 's old
Chinese life based on an illusion of changeless stability is shattered.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#60:1>
Becoming paranoid and morbidly afraid of change, Moon Orchid
repeatedly claims that she is being followed by foreign &ldquo; ghosts.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#61:1>
&rdquo; She is finally sent to a mental asylum, where she dies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#62:1>
By telling Moon Orchid 's story, however, the narrator creates a
voice for this oppressed woman from the East.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#63:1>
Brave Orchid diagnoses Moon Orchid 's mental disorder as stemming
from her misplaced spirit.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#64:1>
By recording her aunt 's disintegration, Maxine gives Moon Orchid a
place in her <mention> &ldquo; mother book &rdquo; </mention> and appeases
the aunt 's spirit.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#65:1>
She even transforms the mental hospital into a quasi-utopian
community of women.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#66:1>
For the failing Moon Orchid her stay in the mental institution
paradoxically brings her needed stability and a temporary place to anchor her
spirit.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#67:1>
She also finds acceptance from her &ldquo; daughters, &rdquo;
psychiatric patients of different races, and therefore is able to talk
<quote> &ldquo; a new story &rdquo; </quote> about perfect communication
instead of the other old one of persecution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#68:1>
<mention> &ldquo; A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe, &rdquo;
</mention> the last section of <mention> The Woman Warrior </mention> , in
which Maxine recalls her struggle with a personal voice from kindergarten to
the narrative present: <quote> <it> &ldquo; My silence was thickest total
during the three years that I covered my school paintings with black paint
&rdquo; </it> </quote> Maxine writes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#69:1>
The blackness of her paintings is not a sign of mental disturbance,
as her American teachers have assumed: <quote> <it> &ldquo; I was making a
stage curtain, it was the moment before the curtain parted and rose, &rdquo;
</it> </quote> the adult Maxine explains.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#70:1>
Once the curtain is up, there is <quote> <it> &ldquo; sunlight
underneath, mighty operas. &rdquo; </it> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#71:1>
This transformation of blackness provides an excellent metaphor for
the novel.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#72:1>
The psychodrama of young Maxine 's linguistic struggle is concretely
enacted in an incident that takes place when she is in the sixth grade.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#73:1>
One day young Maxine confronts and physically attacks a quiet Chinese
American girl, admittedly her double, in a basement bathroom after school.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#74:1>
But only <quote> <it> &ldquo; sobs, chokes, noises that were almost
words &rdquo; </it> </quote> come out of the girl, never a comprehensible
word.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#75:1>
<quote> <it> &ldquo; If you don't talk, you can't have a personality,
&rdquo; </it> </quote> Maxine shouts ( to herself as well as to the other
girl).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#76:1>
Maxine 's sadistic cruelty signifies her own inner trauma of
inarticulateness.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#77:1>
After this underground encounter, Maxine spends eighteen months in
bed <quote> &ldquo; with a mysterious illness &rdquo; </quote> and the quiet
girl lives under the protection of her family for the rest of her life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#78:1>
After years of silence the teenager Maxine finds an angry voice in a
confrontation with her mother.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#79:1>
Before this showdown Maxine has tried unsuccessfully to confess to
the two-hundred-odd offenses that she has committed in her young life, such
as tormenting the silent girl and stealing from the cash register at the
family laundry.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#80:1>
<X> <quote  <it> > &ldquo; If only I could let my mother know the
list, &rdquo; </it> Maxine thought, <it> &ldquo; she and the world would
become more like me, and I would never be alone again. &rdquo; </it> </quote>
</X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#81:1>
Yet the mother puts a stop to Maxine 's attempt at communication, and
the pain of silence finally drives Maxine to shout out her defiance of
Chinese misogynism and her desire to leave home.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#82:1>
This triumphant voicing, however, is immediately under the narrator 's
sorrowful reflection as an older and wiser person: <X> <quote> <it> &ldquo;
Be careful what you say.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X83:1>
It comes true.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X84:1>
It comes true.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X85:1>
I had to leave home in order to see the world logically, logic the
new way of seeing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X86:1>
I learned to think that mysteries are for explanation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X87:1>
I enjoy the simplicity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X88:1>
Concrete pours out of my mouth to cover the forests with freeways
and sidewalks.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X89:1>
Give me plastic, periodical tables, t.v. dinner with vegetables no
more complex than peas mixed with diced carrots.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#X90:1>
Shine floodlights into dark corners: no ghost. &rdquo; </it>
</quote> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#91:1>
Her ghost-free new life is based on a rootless sterility represented
by the concrete and plastic culture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#92:1>
She has escaped the Chinese interdiction of female speech at the
expense of a maternal inheritance of rich imagination.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#93:1>
It takes years for Maxine to come to her right artistic voice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#94:1>
At the end of <mention> The Woman Warrior </mention> , Maxine
finished her story of development with a return to her matrilineal age.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#95:1>
This reconnection is mediated through that talk story.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#96:1>
The daughter continues the story that her mother has started <quote>
<it> &ldquo; The beginning is hers, the ending, mine &rdquo; </it> </quote>
telling about T 'sai Yen, a poet who had been abducted by a nomadic tribe,
had two children with the barbarian chieftain, and later was ransomed back to
China.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#97:1>
T 'sai Yen brought her song, <mention> &ldquo; Eighteen Stanzas for a
Barbarian Reed Pipe, &rdquo; </mention> back, and it <quote> &ldquo;
translated well. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#98:1>
For Maxine, T 'sai Yen is an emblem of the artist <foreign> par
excellence </foreign> , whose poetic power is capable of transforming a
weapon, the whistling arrow, into a musical instrument.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#99:1>
Like the transformed swordswoman in <mention> &ldquo; White Tiger,
&rdquo; </mention> T 'sai Yen is a word warrior who serves as a model for the
author of <mention> The Woman Warrior </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#100:1>
Thus, the interpenetrating stories in <mention> The Woman Warrior
</mention> provide a link between Kingston 's past and present.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#101:1>
The central metaphor of the book is a Chinese knot in which various
strands are interwoven into a work of folk art.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#102:1>
Maxine, as <quote> &ldquo; an outlaw knot-maker, &rdquo; </quote>
weaves the past and the present together into an intricate pattern to create
her <mention> &ldquo; mother book. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#103:1>
By talking stories she successfully builds a matrilineal age to
counterpoint the traditional Chinese patrilineage and unmuffles a personal
yet rooted voice for herself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#104:1>
Maxine succeeds in her revenge by reporting the crimes of sexism
and racism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#105:1>
Despite her diminutive physical stature, she deserves the title of a
<mention> word warrior </mention> in every sense.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#106:1>
Maxine 's literary innovations are also significant contributions to
American literature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#107:1>
Moreover, Maxine 's use of a narrator in <mention> The Woman
Warrior </mention> shows an odd mixture of American and Chinese styles.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#108:1>
Maxine 's habit of writing from different perspectives and jumping
back and forth between viewpoints in a way confused us.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#109:1>
A knowledge of the difference between American and Chinese views of
the self does much to clarify her habit of jumping back and forth between the
point of view of such characters as the No Name Woman, Brave Orchid, Moon
Orchid, Fa Mu Lan, and the protagonist herself.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#110:1>
She used the term <mention> &ldquo; I &rdquo; </mention> in parts of
her novel, probably in an attempt to keep the story grounded and to
incorporate her American style into the story.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#111:1>
Much of the novel, however, is comprised of the stories of others,
and it is not until the end of these stories that the protagonist includes
her own opinions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#112:1>
For the most part, the protagonist gives credit for these stories to
others ( her mother in particular), only vaguely hinting that some of the
ideas may be her own.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#113:1>
In this way, the protagonist seems to define herself in terms of
other people.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#114:1>
It is only at the end of the novel, in the very last section, that
the protagonist really speaks for herself and tells her own story.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#115:1>
This storytelling method reflects the Chinese idea that the self
comes second to the whole, but the story is a memoir meant to relate
experiences of the author herself.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#116:1>
By writing about herself, she goes against the Chinese ideal of
self.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-003#117:1>
Her use of a narrator thus shows an attempt to bridge the paradox
between American and Chinese writing. </p> ... </I>
