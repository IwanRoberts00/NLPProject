 <$A> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#1:1:A>
Good afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#2:1:A>
Uh thank you for being here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#3:1:A>
Uh yeah as Loy said the title of my sharing is <mention> Motivational Touches in the English Classroom </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#4:1:A>
Uhm first I 'd just like to make some definitions and one disclaimer okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#5:1:A>
Uh one for motivation uhm by <mention> motivation </mention> I mean uhm uhm uh the engagement of students in uh in the tasks <indig> 'no </indig> that are set before them in the classroom <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#6:1:A>
Uhm I read this book unfortunately I cannot remember the title uh and the author
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#7:1:A>
It 's uh it 's uh it 's one of these American uhm recipe source book things also
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#8:1:A>
Uhm uh the the writers there said that uh if you have at least ninety percent of your students uhm engaged in whatever you assign them to do that means your your class is motivated <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#9:1:A>
So it seems like that the bottom line for motivation if you see that they 're working
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#10:1:A>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#11:1:A>
Uhm if they 're excited about what they 're doing then that 's the icing on the cake okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#12:1:A>
Uhm now of course motivation can be achieved in many ways no you can get human beings to do to do what you want them to do through many through a whole range of of tactics <indig> 'no </indig> from torture to pleading
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#13:1:A>
It 's not like it 's not you know uh I kind of course I go in somewhere in the middle ground <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#14:1:A>
Uhm I can't do this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#15:1:A>
There are people there are I have had teachers who could get us who could motivate us by being strict <indig> 'no </indig> the the authoritarian way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#16:1:A>
Uhm and I 've had teachers who could motivate us by you know the martyr thing <indig> sige na naman </indig> you know pleading
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#17:1:A>
Uhm I 'm not comfortable with either
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#18:1:A>
Uh the authoritarian way is very alien to my personality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#19:1:A>
It I find it tiring so I I rarely get angry because it exhausts me more than it does the students
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#20:1:A>
And I don't like to plead because that 's demeaning for a teacher
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#21:1:A>
Uh I tend to go it 's somewhere the middle ground and the middle ground I choose uhm tends to be on the playful side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#22:1:A>
Uhm I don't really know why
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#23:1:A>
It 's just that I I 'm happier playing than I am working so I guess I bring the play into my work
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#25:1:A>
Uhm so the <.> ta </.> the the some of the <.> ac </.> activities I 'll share with you today uh are generally of the playful sort
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#26:1:A>
Uhm they I 've most of these the the regular connected to to uh classifications <indig> 'no </indig> regular activities and special activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#27:1:A>
The regular ones I 've tried I think I 've tried these all here in my class uh in my classes here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#28:1:A>
So and they 've worked <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#29:1:A>
Uhm and then the special ones uh those were developed for really special circumstances
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#30:1:A>
Uhm the there was something I really wanted to achieve that was big and you know I had to do something big
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#32:1:A>
Uhm I call these <mention> touches </mention> rather than strategies or you know something big like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#33:1:A>
They 're just touches because they 're uhm <,> they don't have to be part of a whole uh pedagogical schema <indig> 'no </indig> to to in order to work
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#34:1:A>
They can they 're they 're rather self-contained and uh they can be inserted anywhere within even the <.> tradi </.> uhm so-called traditional type of lesson
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#35:1:A>
They can be inserted you know to to break the routine you know or you know you 're just you 're just too tired of doing the same thing you wanna try something different
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#37:1:A>
They 're self-contained enough to do that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#38:1:A>
And uh they can be used uhm either as uhm appetizers for a coming lesson or they can be used as enrichment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#39:1:A>
So either way or they can be also the main lesson itself
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#40:1:A>
Depends on how you process them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#41:1:A>
Uhm alright I 'll go into the regular touches first
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#42:1:A>
Uhm each of these uhm are enough for one La Salle class period <indig> 'no </indig> one hour or one and a half hours <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#43:1:A>
Uhm they 're meant uh some of them I have used really as uh as an entire lesson
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#44:1:A>
Some of them I I used as a uh <indig> e </indig> to introduce some grammar point or whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#45:1:A>
The first one I 'd like to share is the sentence auction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#46:1:A>
I think I have the <,,> uhm the sentence auction is an activity I got from uh Mario Rinvolucri 's uh <mention> Grammar Games </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#47:1:A>
It was published nineteen eighty-four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#48:1:A>
Uh this is this is good uh for teaching uh sentence construction uhm for uhm revising erroneous sentences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#49:1:A>
As you can see on the sheet the uhm the sentence auction game the main uh material I mean uh for the sentence auction game is the auction sheet <,> where you have a list of sentences uhm some of them correct but most of them with some kind of error uh could be punctuation spelling grammar uh whatever <,> syntax
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#50:1:A>
And then if you see on the right side we have uh a series of blanks under <mention> budget </mention> and a series of blanks under <mention> bought </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#51:1:A>
The idea here is uhm uh you give a copy of the auction sheet to the students
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#52:1:A>
Uh what I did was I gave them about ten minutes I think to go over the sentences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#53:1:A>
Uh we did one to fifteen for one class period
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#54:1:A>
That 's as far as we could get so I let them do one to fifteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#55:1:A>
Uhm they have to decide which sentences are right and which sentences 
are wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#56:1:A>
In the auction they are supposed to bid for the sentences that they think are correct
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#57:1:A>
I gave them a budget fifteen thousand pesos for this okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#58:1:A>
So that 's like one thousand pesos per sentence okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#59:1:A>
So they they so under the budget uh budget uhm column they have to indicate uhm how much they would be willing to spend for whatever sentences they think they wanna buy <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#60:1:A>
How high are they gonna go in the bidding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#61:1:A>
This this is so that they can control their budget <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#62:1:A>
And then later when the when the bidding has has uh uhm commenced uhm well those who who uh who managed to you know the highest bidders uhm can indicate on the <mention> bought </mention> blank uh how much they actually spent for the sentence <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#63:1:A>
Now I play the role of the auctioneer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#64:1:A>
This has to be done very fast because you have to generate the you know the auction excitement okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#65:1:A>
So uh after the ten minutes are up <indig> 'no </indig> uhm I tell them okay you 're you 've already got
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#66:1:A>
Uh I did this uh I did this uh or rather I I let them work in pairs by the way <indig> 'no </indig> I let them work in pairs so they could you know some discussion going on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#67:1:A>
Uhm and I <.> ge </.> I asked the pairs to uhm write a number <indig> 'no </indig> different number <indig> 'no </indig> for each of them on uh like one fourth sheet of paper big enough for me to see
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#68:1:A>
Because when they start bidding and you know I have to know which pair bought which they have to raise their number
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#69:1:A>
So it 's just the numbers I write <&> clears throat </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#70:1:A>
So when the bidding starts okay I could go something like uhm <,> uh alright uhm auction has started item up for auction now is the sentence number one 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#72:1:A>
<mention> I wanted that you should know what happened </mention> <&> sentence in the game </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#73:1:A>
Do I hear five hundred pesos for this auction for this sentence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#74:1:A>
Do I hear five hundred <.> sen </.> sentence is a genuine antique
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#75:1:A>
Uhm it was uh last used by Louis the fourteenth every word made of solid gold
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#77:1:A>
<&> starts speaking at a faster rate </&> Do I hear five hundred five hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#78:1:A>
Do I hear five hundred and then there 's five hundred fifty over here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#79:1:A>
Five hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#80:1:A>
Do I hear six hundred six hundred six hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#81:1:A>
Do I six hundred over here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#82:1:A>
Do I hear seven hundred seven hundred seven seven hundred over here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#83:1:A>
Do I hear a thousand a thousand a thousand and there is one thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#84:1:A>
Do I hear one thousand five hundred one thousand five hundred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#85:1:A>
Nobody says one thousand alright going one one thousand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#86:1:A>
Going once going twice and sold for one thousand pesos to pair number eight 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#87:1:A>
And then I write it down here okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#88:1:A>
So sentence number one bought to sold to pair number eight one thousand pesos <indig> 'no </indig> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#89:1:A>
It 's tiring <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#90:1:A>
And then right after that I go to
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#91:1:A>
Alright next item on auction sentence number two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#92:1:A>
<mention> What happen to your sister last night </mention> <&> sentence in the game </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#93:1:A>
Every word made of jade Ming dynasty and so on and so forth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#94:1:A>
So I go on until all the <.> se </.> the fifteen sentences have been bought <indig> 'no <indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#95:1:A>
Uh for the sentences that were not bought I just put an X because I have all the numbers on the board one to fifteen <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#96:1:A>
It 's if nobody wanted it so it 's X </indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#97:1:A>
And this is really fun because you know this you know after a while I didn't even have to go into the Ming dynasty and Louis the fourteenth bit because it was really going fast <indig> 'no </indig> because the biddings were coming up you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#98:1:A>
There was even one group that uhm that splurged fourteen thousand pesos on one sentence and it turned out to be wrong <O> laughter <O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#99:1:A>
It it was fun <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#100:1:A>
So this went on the the auctioning I think went for uhm thirty minutes uh thereabouts so thirty minutes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#101:1:A>
After after we went through the fifteen sentences I told them okay I 'll let you know now which sentences are correct
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#102:1:A>
And I just told them which number <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#103:1:A>
For the fifteen I think there 's only one that 's correct
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#104:1:A>
Uhm <,> uh <mention> What killed whom and when </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#105:1:A>
That 's number three I think that was all that was right if I remember right <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#107:1:A>
So I just told them okay then everything else is wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#108:1:A>
And so of course there 's a lot of you know waaahh you know you know I spent too much and so on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#109:1:A>
And then uh but I don't tell them what 's wrong with the other sentences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#110:1:A>
I told them okay go over the sentences the wrong sentences that you bought and then try to figure out what was the error in those sentences and then correct them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#111:1:A>
So that was their seatwork <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#112:1:A>
So each pair yeah after the auction so each pair uh wrote in the corrections to the the the incorrect sentences that they had bought <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#113:1:A>
The others that they didn't buy it 's okay you you don't have to touch that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#114:1:A>
Uhm I gave them seatwork points for this you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#115:1:A>
Uh if you bought only the one correct sentence uh if you budgeted only like I looked at their budget list if you budgeted only for the one correct sentence you have five seatwork points
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#116:1:A>
Uhm and then you know if there 's a corresponding graduated you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#117:1:A>
You get four seatwork points if you bought that one correct sentence but you have like two or three incorrect along with it <indig> 'no </indig> and so on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#118:1:A>
So I just <&> clears throat </&> freshmen uh uhm freshmen <&> someone asked a question but inaudible </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#119:1:A>
Sometimes well <,> uh <.> dep </.> it would depend on what you mean by disciplinary 'cause this one is really meant to be noisy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#120:1:A>
They 're meant to shout
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#121:1:A>
They 're meant to get excited
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#122:1:A>
And so of course they were shouting
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#123:1:A>
And I had to shout over their <,> it 's under control because they were focused <indig> 'no </indig> they 're focused on this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#124:1:A>
As in my God were they ever focused you know 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#125:1:A>
It was really you know it the the the objective really of this is to get them practically jumping on their seats <indig> 'no </indig> with with you know the desire to buy this sentence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#126:1:A>
And oh it worked <indig> 'no </indig> and then afterwards then you know when everything is quiet and they have to do the the you know the correction and all that and then afterwards we process <indig> 'no </indig> why is it correct
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#128:1:A>
Uh the <.> sec </.> this was uh the the following session uh that 's when we <indig> ano </indig> uh I mean we don't have enough
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#129:1:A>
We have enough for the auction and the seatwork
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#130:1:A>
Uh that would take you about an hour
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#131:1:A>
And then the following grammar time we went through the sentences okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#132:1:A>
So I tried this out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-051#133:1:A>
Actually I had thirty but uhm uh I found that uh one session is enough 

 </I>
