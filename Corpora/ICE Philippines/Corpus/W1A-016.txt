<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X2:1>
1. Discuss two ethical concerns in doing sociolinguistic fieldwork.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X3:1>
2. Discuss Quakenbush 's finding regarding the status of Agutaynen in
relation to the other languages in that speech community.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X4:1>
3. Explain briefly one advantage of using the matched guise technique
in studying language attitudes. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#5:1>
1. In doing sociolinguistic fieldwork, a researcher must be
conscious of, among other things, a couple of ethical concerns such as 1) the
role the researcher plays and 2) the purpose in doing the study.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#6:1>
The researcher shld. only take on a role that s/he feels natural about
and does not go against his/her principles.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#7:1>
Also, the purpose of the study may be given/revealed to the subjects
only insofar as it helps in eliciting the necessary information.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#8:1>
Researcher needs to stay as close to the truth as possible w/o
revealing all details of study. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#9:1>
2. The Agutaynens love their language no matter what the other
members of the community feel about it or despite the fact that it does not
have the same prestige as Cuyonon or Tagalog or English.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#10:1>
Agutaynen is regarded as a <mention> &ldquo; LOW &rdquo; </mention>
language; Cuyonon as <mention> Middle </mention> ; Tagalog as <mention> High
</mention> and English as <mention> Dummy High </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#11:1>
3. The <mention> matched guise technique </mention> focuses on
the <ul> language used </ul> and not on the speakers so that for ex., 3
speakers may be utilized to speak 6 different passages in 2 languages.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#12:1>
This technique allows the &ldquo; hearers &rdquo; to assume that
there are 6 diff. speakers thus, eliminating any biases they ( subjects) may
have about the speakers ' nationality.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#13:1>
So they may focus on proficiency and language prestige. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#14:1>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X15:1>
1. Discuss the major pattern of progression in address in American
English.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X16:1>
2. What pattern did Labov find for the variable ( r) in New York
City?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X17:1>
3. What is the source of misinterpretation/misunderstanding whenever
Korean shopkeepers and African-American customers interact?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X18:1>
4. A major rule in conversation has been called by Fasold as the
<mention> <quote> &ldquo; no gap, no overlap &rdquo; </quote> </mention>
rule; show why Coates rejected it for her all-female conversation data. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#19:1>
1. In terms of address in American English, when two adults
<delete> fir </delete> initially address each other, they start out with last
names.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#20:1>
As they progress in their acquaintance or as they know each other
longer, the person of the higher status initiates in calling or addressing
the person of lower status by using the first name.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#21:1>
With time and familiarity the two may progress to FN basis.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#22:1>
But it is always the person of the higher status who is the
gatekeeper in <delete> the use of </delete> the term of address to use. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#23:1>
2. Labov found out that <delete> the </delete> social
stratification determined how ( r) was pronounced.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#24:1>
Those from the upper socio-econ. status ( Saks 5th Ave.) had marked (
r-1) pronunciation while those from Kleins had ( r-0).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#25:1>
People who went to Macys representing the middle were aware of the
marked ( and prestigious) ( r) and would approximate the desired
pronunciation in the emphatic mode. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#26:1>
3. Misinterpretation between Koreans and African-Americans
recurred because of cultural misunderstanding about how each showed respect
to the other.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#27:1>
The Korean shop owners/cashier showed restraint involvement in their
interaction - - not wanting to impose upon the other, while African-Americans
showed involvement politeness or positive face focusing on interaction and
small talk.

<p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#28:1>
4. In all-female interaction, the <mention> <quote> &ldquo; no
gap, no overlap rule &rdquo; </quote> </mention> is violated as seen in the
many instances of simultaneous speech.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#29:1>
These &ldquo; overlaps &rdquo; happen as a result of or because of
the participants' eagerness to join in the conversation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#30:1>
Rather than being seen as competing to take the floor, it is seen as
contributing to the discussion and the building of social interaction. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#31:1>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X32:1>
1. Discuss one conclusion that Trudgill arrived at in his study of
British pop-song pronunciation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X33:1>
2. Edwards found an interaction between social class and sex in
children 's speech.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X34:1>
What is this interaction? </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#35:1>
1. Trudgill asserts that people tend to approximate the
pronunciation of the &ldquo; standard", in this case American, in their
singing even if in their natural speech, they don't sound that way.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#36:1>
One reason could be because the British pop singers ' target market
is American and so the singers would attempt to sound like them.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#37:1>
This shows a case of linguistic insecurity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#38:1>
But over time, as in the case of the Beatles, once they have &ldquo;
arrived &rdquo; the singers sounded more like they would naturally, and so
did not have to approximate the &ldquo; standard &rdquo; because they had
achieved their security, linguistically and otherwise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#39:1>
2. Acdg. to Edwards <delete> young children </> middle class
speech tended to sound more polite, more correct, more like the traditional
standard, thus more feminine.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#40:1>
On the other hand, working class speech was perceived to be rougher
and more masculine.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#41:1>
This was true even for young children who it seemed even at their
age, had already absorbed social norms on sex and social class.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#42:1>
Thus, WC girls were mistaken for boys and MC boys were mistaken for
girls. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#43:1>
16 Feb. 2002 <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X44:1>
1. Joos says that English has five style levels.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X45:1>
What are the five styles?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X46:1>
Characterize one of those styles.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X47:1>
2. In what way is P. Fishman justified in titling her article,
<quote> &ldquo; Interaction: The work women do &rdquo; </quote> ?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X48:1>
3. Freed & Greenwood debunk some of Fishman 's claims.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X49:1>
Discuss one claim of Fishman and the refutation provided by Freed &
Greenwood. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#50:1>
1. The five styles according to Joos are: <mention> Intimate,
Casual, Consultative, Formal and Frozen </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#51:1>
<mention> Intimate style </mention> is one used by interlocutors who
share much background information and are very familiar with each other, as
married couples would be.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#52:1>
So familiar would they be that a mere word uttered between them would
be easily understood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#53:1>
2. The title Fishman used reflects the generalization she makes
about who does more work and carries the load in interaction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#54:1>
They do the <quote> &ldquo; shit work &rdquo; </quote> in
conversation, maintaining, supporting, and continuing it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#55:1>
Despite doing much of the work, though, Fishman contends that it is
still the men who are in control. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#56:1>
3. Freed and Greenwood refute Fishman 's finding that women ask
more questions in conversation to get the men to interact.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#57:1>
In Freed 's and Greenwood 's view, both men and women use this device
in comparable frequency.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#58:1>
Rather than attributing the frequency of question use to gender and
power relationships, it is the context that also <delete> plays </delete>
comes into play.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#59:1>
In this case, men and women are more alike than different. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#60:1>
23 Feb. 2002 <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X61:1>
1. Discuss how the behavior of women in Oberwart is contributing to
the loss of speakers of Hungarian in the community.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X62:1>
2. Why does Eckert find the use of sex as a variable in
sociolinguistic ( variation) studies unsatisfactory? </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#63:1>
1. The women in Oberwart use German more often ( even when their
interlocutors speak Hungarian) to signal their rejection of the lifestyle
that Hungarian represents.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#64:1>
Hungarian is associated with the peasants while German is associated
with the worker.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#65:1>
Because of this behaviour women tend to look for men who speak German
( and thus more prestigious).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#66:1>
The peasant men, meantime, have to look outside their immediate
community to women who will not reject their peasant status.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#67:1>
However, the women outside Oberwart more likely than not would be
German speaking.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#68:1>
So the twin effects contribute to the loss of Hungarian in the
community. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#69:1>
2. Acdg. to Eckert, <mention> sex </mention> refers to the
biological differentiation in people that tends to be seen as binary
opposites.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#70:1>
<mention> Gender </mention> would be a richer, more varied variable
since it would take into account other factors as situational context and
other sociological aspects. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#71:1>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X72:1>
1. Explain/exemplify Frake 's observation that in the adjectives of
Zamboangue&ntilde;o, the unmarked forms are Spanish and the marked forms are
Philippine.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X73:1>
2. Describe how a pidgin develops and how a creole develops from a
pidgin.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X74:1>
3. Discuss the explanation that Bautista offers for why we
code-switch and mention two kinds of evidence she presents from her data.
</X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#75:1>
1. The unmarked forms in Zm. are in Spanish and thus suggest that
the bigger, older, masculine, more prestigious adjectives are used.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#76:1>
The Phil. forms are exemplified as <indig> putot </indig> ( small),
Sp. forms as <foreign> claro </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#77:1>
Thus, it seems Sp. is <quote> and Phil. is </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#78:1>
2. A pidgin develops when two groups of speakers who speak two
distinct languages come in contact with each other.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#79:1>
These 2 groups find ways of communicating with each other.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#80:1>
A pidgin develops into a creole when a number of people speaking it
increase.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#81:1>
This is the case of Chabacano. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#82:1>
3. Bautista says that we code-switch because of 1) proficiency
and 2) deficiency.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#83:1>
When speakers possess full mastery of two languages, they CS easily
between these languages for convenience.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#84:1>
On the other hand, when speakers are learning a new language or are
not sufficiently knowledgeable about the terms ( as in the case of our
students) they also CS. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#85:1>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X86:1>
1. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis concerns the relationship between
language and worldview/culture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X87:1>
Explain the hypothesis in your own words.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X88:1>
2. In what ways are Polish compliments different from American
compliments?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X89:1>
3. Agar suggests a way of seeing bilingualism in terms of <quote>
&ldquo; culture continuous rather than discrete, partial rather than
complete, relative to the situation of contact rather than independent.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#X90:1>
Explain. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#91:1>
1. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis maintains that language influences
the worldview.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#92:1>
So that in Whorf 's example of the <ul> empty drums </ul> , people
tend to behave carelessly around it thinking that the word <mention> <ul>
empty </ul> </mention> makes the situation safe.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#93:1>
In his study of the Hopi culture, Whorf found certain concepts (
<foreign> e.g. </foreign> time) that were viewed differently from SAE.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#94:1>
In this &ldquo; strong view &rdquo; he formulated, he seemed to
suggest that languages were impossible to translate into others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#95:1>
2. Polish compliments have free word order whereas American
compliments have fixed word order such as NP + Adj.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#96:1>
Another difference is that the Polish tend to reject or downplay the
compliment received while Americans are more accepting.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#97:1>
Also, American compliments are more about personal qualities ( looks,
hair, ability) while the Polish focus on material possessions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#98:1>
3. Learning a language and becoming communicatively competent in
it requires that one must take into account the culture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#99:1>
Language <delete> and culture </delete> must be learned within its
culture and not learned independently of it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#100:1>
A language learner approximates L1 mastery when s/he is able to
grasp the nuances of meaning of <quote> &ldquo; rich points &rdquo; </quote>
found in the lang. & culture. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#101:2>
To be sixteen...

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#102:2>
What was it like?... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#103:2>
Being sixteen for me, was actually a turning point in my life
where I had to learn the hardships of drastic change and crisis.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#104:2>
This was the year after I got fished out of my home to live in the
heat of Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#105:2>
So sudden was the transition from a perfect childhood to a
treacherous adolescence that I was forced to grow up faster than most of my
age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#106:2>
When I was sixteen I wore my hair down and let me be me.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#107:2>
I was discovering that all I had known to be safe and true was gone
and I had to start all over again.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#108:2>
I remember missing my friends; missing a place called the bamboo
forest - a tiny patch of clearing in the middle of a bamboo forest.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#109:2>
Whenever the gray walls and sticky heat of the city pestered me I 'd
close my eyes and bring myself back into that place.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#110:2>
I could see Walter, Frankie, Paolo, Richard, Warren and Marzy
sitting together, a pack of smiling faces staring at the graceful dance of
the sunlight as it bounced to and from the shiny bamboo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#111:2>
Sixteen was when I had to put on my first school uniform, I had
to comb my hair and keep inside what I felt about the world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#112:2>
I had to try and find friendship in a place I thought impossible and
I spent the whole of my crazy adolescence finding belongingness in a strange
city place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#113:2>
Sixteen was also when boys didn't just want to play football
with me but tried to hold my hand.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#114:2>
Sixteen was also the time when I finally looked at myself and asked
<quote> &ldquo; Who are you?" </quote> , <quote> &ldquo; What do you want?
&rdquo; </quote> and <quote> &ldquo; Can you be strong enough to be happy?".
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#115:2>
I don't think being sixteen ever ends for me.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-016#116:2>
All I know is that 's when it all began. </p> </I>
