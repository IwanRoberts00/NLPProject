When we transferred to Assumption we were accelerated one grade up and so <?> when I was </?> in grade four

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#18:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#19:1:B>
So Assumption was grade five up to fourth year high school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#20:1:B>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#22:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#23:1:A>
And then now you work with <{> <[> FLAG </[> <&> Free Legal Assistance Group </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#24:1:B>
<[> FLAG </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#25:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#26:1:A>
All that while you 've been <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#27:1:B>
Uh okay you see I worked <indig> ganito </indig> nineteen seventy-four I was still a student and I worked part-time with my Dad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#28:1:B>
Before this I was part-time with uh no I was doing social work at Senden Home and then which is an orphanage for uhm street boys

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#29:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#30:1:B>
And then I worked with my Dad part-time from nineteen <,> eighty-four I think it was <,> until I graduated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#31:1:B>
When I graduated actually before I graduated I was supposed to go abroad but the government withheld my passport
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#32:1:B>
So since I couldn't travel uhm and I graduated Mass Com my Dad asked me to work with him rather than to work for the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#33:1:B>
<{> <[> Because if you 're </[> in broadcasting you work with the government you have no choice
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#36:1:B>
So I said sure for a while and I ended up working with him for something like fourteen years before he died 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#34:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#37:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#38:1:B>
Uh so but I was also I was doing a lot of crazy things like I was teaching in U S T
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#39:1:B>
I was teaching in Assumption
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#40:1:B>
I was not a very good teacher <&> speaker A chuckles </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#41:1:B>
I have no patience
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#42:1:B>
Uh and I used to dub you know those Japanese cartoons <{> <[> <,> </[> as in Voltes Five 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#43:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#45:1:A>
<indig> Oo </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#46:1:B>
Okay but I was not in Voltes Five I was in the cartoon called Grendaizer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#47:1:B>
So I would dub I 'd be a voice talent uh part-time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#49:1:B>
<indig> Pero </indig> I was <indig> nga </indig> holding down about four jobs all at the same time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#50:1:B>
I was teaching in U S T uhm twenty-one units
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#51:1:B>
I was teaching in Assumption no U S T I think <&> break in the recording </&> in Assumption something like eighteen or twenty-one units <{> <[> <,> </[> and then I was uh dubbing and then I was working for my Dad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#54:1:B>
All at the same time 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#52:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#55:1:A>
All at the same time

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#56:1:B>
This lasted for about a year
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#57:1:B>
And then after that I went full-time already with my Dad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#58:1:B>
So I used actually uhm I 'm now connected with FLAG
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#59:1:B>
At that time I was helping him out with FLAG uh but let me see I started out with my Dad as the receptionist and then the clerk typist librarian uh bookkeeper accountant
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#60:1:B>
I went around 'till I became his secretary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#61:1:B>
And then eventually I managed his firm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#62:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#63:1:B>
So I started from the bottom up

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#64:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#65:1:B>
There <&> break in recording; presumably she was asked what number she was in the family </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#66:1:B>
Number six

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#67:1:A>
Number six

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#68:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#69:1:A>
Uh here uh number six

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#70:1:B>
Okay I have a son I am not married

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#72:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#73:1:B>
Uh my son is now eleven years old
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#74:1:B>
He is uhm the one who looks I think the most like my Dad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#75:1:B>
And he was <{> <[> the </[> favorite of my Dad <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#78:1:B>
To think he was the only one who was who can 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#76:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#79:1:A>
He 's the only one Maya who says that she was the baby until her nephew came along

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#80:1:B>
That 's him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#81:1:A>
This is the one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#82:1:B>
Yeah because she used to be the favorite until my son came along
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#83:1:B>
When my son came along there was no more favorite except my son
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#84:1:B>
He was the one who would accompany my Dad everywhere
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#85:1:B>
He had a desk in my Dad 's office which you know kind of wasn't allowed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#86:1:B>
Uh but he was the only one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#87:1:B>
He would he he and Dad were very close
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#88:1:B>
They were <indig> talagang <,> </indig> <&> unclear utterance by speaker A </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#89:1:B>
Now he is eleven

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#90:1:A>
So when your Dad died he was only

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#91:1:B>
He <.> wa </.> Dad died in eighty-seven

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#92:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#93:1:B>
February
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#94:1:B>
And my son 's birthday is also February

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#95:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#96:1:B>
Uh so <indig> ano </indig> he he took he really took it very badly because he viewed my father I would say uhm not so much as a <indig> lolo </indig> I mean both as a <indig> lolo </indig> because he was spoiled rotten really <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#97:1:B>
Uh but also he but my Dad was his father image
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#98:1:B>
That was his concept
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#99:1:B>
So when my Dad died he he he he his studies were you know he just didn't wanna study anymore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#100:1:B>
He he he was really of <.> al </.> I think <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#101:1:B>
Uhm let me put it this way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#102:1:B>
I could not grieve as much because I had to look after him <{> <[> <,> </[> because he was the one who really really really I mean 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#103:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#105:1:A>
He took it badly

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#106:1:B>
He he really did
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#107:1:B>
He he took it badly <unclear> word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#108:1:B>
He couldn't sleep he wouldn't eat you know that type 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#109:1:B>
<indig> Siya talaga 'yung naapektuhan </indig> so I was affected but I couldn't <&> break in the recording </&> because I had <{> <[> to </[> attend to my son

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#110:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#111:1:A>
Well anyway so <,> you remember your Dad before he was into politics
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#112:1:A>
<{> <[> Do you remember that time </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#113:1:B>
<[> As a kid </[> </{> I used to work for him all the time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#114:1:B>
You see my Dad was more my boss
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#115:1:B>
He and I had a very good relationship but I would say that I knew him very well as a <{> <[> boss </[> uhm because I worked for him 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#117:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#119:1:A>
So what was his personality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#120:1:A>
What what <{> <[> kind of a person </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#121:1:B>
<[> He was </[> </{> a perfectionist
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#122:1:B>
Okay I

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#123:1:A>
Yet I heard he always did things last minute

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#124:1:B>
Yeah but he was a perfectionist <{> <[> in this </[> sense <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#125:1:A>
<[> Uh yeah </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#126:1:B>
There 's a pleading
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#127:1:B>
Uh he he does not like Touch and Go <&> office supply used for erasing </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#128:1:B>
At that time there were no computers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#129:1:B>
So I could not submit anything to him that had an erasure because he didn't like it <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> he was he was that much
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#131:1:B>
He was also what he demanded of himself he demanded of us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#132:1:B>
Uh so he demanded he had very very high standards in everything he did
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#133:1:B>
He felt that if you do something you do it well or you don't do it at all period
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#134:1:B>
And that was what he imposed on himself that 's what he imposed on us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#135:1:B>
He also <,> was uh I don't know a very responsible person uh in this sense <indig> 'no </indig> like for example we the staff I mean I would make him laugh with booboos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#136:1:B>
But in front of the client he would protect us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#137:1:B>
He he would you know but in front of when it was us he would bawl us out <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> why did you do that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#140:1:B>
You were so stupid ta tah ta tah ta tah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#141:1:B>
I mean he had no compunctions about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#142:1:B>
Uh what kind of a person was he
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#143:1:B>
He was also <indig> ano </indig> he loved books <,> and huh he used to say <indig> ale mahal </indig> instead of Ali Mall
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#144:1:B>
That will that was our joke all the time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#145:1:B>
Okay he would go around with us <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#146:1:B>
Several times I used to accompany him to his hearings
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#147:1:B>
He would forget that I was with him <&> speaker A chuckles </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#148:1:B>
He would leave me and it 's up to me to go home
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#149:1:B>
I don't even know where I am and it 's up to me to go home
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#150:1:B>
Because he had so many things in his head

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#138:1:A>
<[1> Ah yeah <indig> ha </indig> </[1> </{1> 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#> <[2> Uhm </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#151:1:A>
Uh he 's always thinking so he

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#152:1:B>
Yeah I thought yeah he was thinking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#153:1:B>
Uhm and <O> sigh </O> and then uhm no okay he loved crossword puzzles
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#154:1:B>
He he would do that a lot of times
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#155:1:B>
Uh <,> what else would we do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#156:1:B>
<indig> Ano rin siya </indig> he was very <,> uhm <foreign> cari&ntilde;oso </foreign> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#157:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#158:1:B>
Uh he would always make <indig> akbay </indig> he would always put his arm around you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#160:1:B>
He was not uh he was not <indig> ano </indig> I mean at least with us <indig> 'no </indig> with us kids very <foreign> cari&ntilde;oso </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#161:1:B>
And then <,> uhm <,,> I don't think he had much of a sense of humor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#162:1:B>
But we would laugh all the time and he wouldn't find it funny
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#163:1:B>
I mean okay there were things he wouldn't find funny of course <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#164:1:B>
I mean uh but <,> not my sense of humor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#165:1:B>
He was more serious than most
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#166:1:B>
Uh he what was his <.> wha </.> what else was he like <,,> you know <indig> basta </indig> he was a tough boss
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#167:1:B>
He he would he was a difficult person for me <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#168:1:B>
He was very challenging to work with
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#169:1:B>
But he was and the thing about okay there are a lot of things I like
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#170:1:B>
He accepted a lot of criticism <,> for someone <indig> 'no </indig> who who writes as well and as intelligent as him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#171:1:B>
For example he had a talk
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#172:1:B>
He would prepare his talk
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#173:1:B>
He would show it to me announcing you read it you read it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#174:1:B>
Tell me what you think 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#175:1:B>
He hated an answer like it 's okay 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#176:1:A>
It 's okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#177:1:B>
I he hated that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#178:1:B>
Uh he encouraged you to argue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#179:1:B>
He encouraged you to criticize even him and his works
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#180:1:B>
And I remember doing that and he I remember telling him Papa no I don't think it should be done this way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#181:1:B>
Uh I don't think this is correct
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#182:1:B>
I don't agree with you 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#183:1:B>
You know etcetera etcetera
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#184:1:B>
And he said and he argued with me and we really argued
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#185:1:B>
And then in the end he says okay and he changed it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#186:1:B>
And then <{> <[> I </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#187:1:A>
<[> He was really </[> </{> open to

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#188:1:B>
Very open and he also for his for a man of his stature his brains he was very intelligent he was also quite humble about himself <,> in that sense
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#189:1:B>
Because very few people <{1> <[1> will </[1> take their work their masterpiece <{2> <[2> being </[2> criticized
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#194:1:B>
He loved it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#195:1:B>
He would show me all his papers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#196:1:B>
What do you think what do you think about this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#198:1:B>
Uh he <,> he always like for example for me I 've I was never a lawyer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#199:1:B>
He trained uh with his father right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#190:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#192:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#202:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#203:1:B>
He he took up two years of law that 's all if I remember
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#204:1:B>
And uh his father used to teach him this <?> trick </?> and he would do it to everybody all of us at us who worked with him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#205:1:B>
His father would tell him read this 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#206:1:B>
He would read it and he would go back to his father and he 'd say I 'm through and his father would say okay read something else 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#207:1:B>
And he asked won't you ask me questions about what I read 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#208:1:B>
No you said you read it I trust you I imagine you understand it if you don't understand it you ask if you don't if you understand it then fine read something else 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#209:1:B>
It stuck with him uhm and the other thing that his father taught him was how to research
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#210:1:B>
So if I asked him any question he would say you have eyes you have a brain God gave them to you go to the library look for whatever it is you 're looking for read it look for it 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#211:1:B>
When we were really stuck then I 'd go to him like sorry can't find it etcetera etcetera
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#212:1:B>
<indig> Hay </indig> then he 'd sit down and explain it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#213:1:B>
And I I never studied law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#214:1:B>
I worked with him but towards I would say uh the eighties already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#215:1:B>
We would sit down and discuss his cases and I would ask him Papa can't you do it this way and he 'd say no you see because if you do it if you handle a case in this way this is what 's gonna happen but if we do it another way it 's fine 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#216:1:B>
So he didn't mind
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#217:1:B>
He never made me or any other person feel stupid

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#218:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#219:1:B>
You could ask a lot of questions and he would take be patient enough to answer it at the same time he encourages you uh not always to think the way he wants
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#220:1:B>
He does not and he already he told us me anyway so many times you can't uhm don't believe what I believe because I believe it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#221:1:B>
Believe what you believe because you believe it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#222:1:B>
I don't expect any of you to follow me or do exactly what I 'm doing or what or what or what <{> <[> <,> </[> you do it because it 's you because it 's what you want 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#223:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#225:1:A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-009#226:1:B>
He really made us pushed us to be very independent thinkers
