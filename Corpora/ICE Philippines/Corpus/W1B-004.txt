Dearest <indig> Tita </indig> Love & Papa,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#3:1>
Hello!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#4:1>
My 10-day leisurely tour in Geneva has given me enough time to write
this letter & start my <indig> &ldquo; kwentos &rdquo; </indig> about my
grand tour.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#5:1>
My stay here has been very restful so far.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#6:1>
In fact, I even visited a nearby public indoor pool to &ldquo;
recharge &rdquo; myself.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#7:1>
It was great to be able to swim again after almost 2 weeks.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#8:1>
Swimming always rejuvenates me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#9:1>
I 've met four <indig> Pinoy </indig> friends here other than my
former student.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#10:1>
They all have computer-related jobs; four, ( including my former
student) work for WHO & the other one for the U.N.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#11:1>
They 're only in their early 20s but already very successful &
earning very well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#12:1>
Anyway, let me start my account of this trip from the beginning.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#13:1>
I left Waseda as early as 6:30 a.m. & took the airport limousine
bus to Narita.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#14:1>
I think I was the very 1st passenger bound for Madrid who checked in
because only empty chairs kept me company for a while at the waiting area.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#15:1>
The plane took off at 10:30 a.m. for its first destination - -
Malaysia.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#16:1>
I was also in transit in Dubai at almost midnight & Istanbul at
around 5 a.m.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#17:1>
Each airport had a &ldquo; personality &rdquo; of its own.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#18:1>
I took every opportunity to inspect a new place & get a glimpse of
another culture as reflected in their respective airport.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#19:1>
I saw many interesting-looking people.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#20:1>
It was a very enriching experience that 's why I didn't mind all that
stopover; not to mention the food also kept pouring in - - <indig> walang
katapusang kainan </indig> !

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#21:1>
That almost-30-hour flight was enough to give me all those unwanted &
dreaded flabs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#22:1>
The long & exhausting trip however took its toll on me when I
finally landed in Madrid.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#23:1>
I went to my hotel by bus & subway, checked in, had lunch, sauntered
around Goya Ave. & its surrounding streets.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#24:1>
When Madrid took a <foreign> siesta </foreign> , I did, too.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#25:1>
The only problem was that, I woke up on the next day already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#26:1>
<del> <unclear> one word </unclear> </del> <indig> ( Natawa talaga
ako.) </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#27:1>
My hotel accommodation was a big surprise.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#28:1>
I only realized I was staying in a 4-star hotel when I got there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#29:1>
I simply chose the least expensive from the list my travel agent
provided.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#30:1>
That important information I took for granted.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#31:1>
( <indig> Hindi naman siguro isasama sa listahan ang lungga ng daga 'no!
</indig> )

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#32:1>
So I chose Convention Hotel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#33:1>
And what a pleasant surprise indeed!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#34:1>
I prepared myself for something less considering my budget
constraints.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#35:1>
I paid &dollar;62/night in that hotel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#36:1>
I definitely got my money 's worth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#37:1>
The next stop was Paris, which became more astounding as days
passed by.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#38:1>
My first day was a bore.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#39:1>
I must have been tired from the 13-hour trip from Madrid though my
cabin was comfortable.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#40:1>
I arrived in Paris at 8:05 a.m. & checked her out right after lunch.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#41:1>
I went to see Bastille, <foreign> Republique </foreign> & the
impressive <foreign> La Basilique du Sacre-Coeur </foreign> ( which was very
near my hotel).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#42:1>
Then, I called it a day.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#43:1>
The next 5 days proved to be more enjoyable however.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#44:1>
I seized every moment & maximized my <foreign> &ldquo; Paris Visite
&rdquo; </foreign> pass which gave me unlimited access to all the metro
trains & buses.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#45:1>
On my last afternoon I took the train to Versailles & checked out the
Eiffel Tower again on my way home.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#46:1>
As for meals, I discovered an inexpensive chicken restaurant right
inside the LOUVRE & had lunch there almost everyday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#47:1>
In Bastille was also a nice Indian-Mexican restaurant where I
befriended an amiable French waitress.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#48:1>
I gave her a tip but not before I politely asked if that practice was
permissible, because in Tokyo it 's not allowed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#49:1>
Anyway, I also discovered some inexpensive grapes in Bastille.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#50:1>
I bought 2 kilos and ate to my heart 's content.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#51:1>
( <indig> Hayy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#52:1>
sarappp! </indig> )

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#53:1>
On the 6th day I headed for Geneva via Eurail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#54:1>
I 'm yet to see how the second class train accommodation is like
but I have no regrets about having taken the first class Europass ( valid in
4 countries) as the seats are very comfortable & with enough leg room.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#55:1>
However, Milette & I will take the plane together from Rome to
London.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#56:1>
I decided to just fly instead of travel to the U.K. by Eurail again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#57:1>
I would have had enough of it by that time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#58:1>
Besides, it will be an extremely hectic schedule in Italy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#59:1>
I anticipate myself to be on my last leg by the time I 'm ready to
leave the land of <foreign> fettuccini </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#60:1>
The faster I get to my next destination, the better & the sooner I
could recharge.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#61:1>
It will be another leisurely trip in the U.K. as I 'll spend the most
time there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#62:1>
I will definitely see Alex Krotov because he requested me to purchase
some MO computer disks for him from Tokyo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#63:1>
He promised to show me around.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#64:1>
He might even bring me to Sheffield where he presently resides.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#65:1>
He & I have kept in touch via e-mail.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#66:1>
( Isn't technology really amazingly convenient?)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#67:1>
He plans on having a heart-to-heart talk with me regarding Heidi (
our American friend/former dormmate).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#68:1>
You see, he really likes her but Heidi is letting the age gap get in
the way of a potential romance despite the fact that the feeling is mutual.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#69:1>
( <Indig> Hayy naku </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#70:1>
These ordinary mortals!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#71:1>
How much longer will I have to deal with them?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#72:1>
heh, heh, heh, <O> drawing of a smiley face </O> ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#73:1>
Oh, I forgot to mention my observation, <foreign> i.e. </foreign>
, neither the subway in Madrid nor Paris even comes close to Tokyo 's.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#74:1>
( <del> Switzerland </del> Geneva only has buses, trams; no subway.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#75:1>
Tokyo still has the cleanest, most well lit, well-ventilated,
well-manned, efficient, orderly, systematic, high-tech, sophisticated &
tourist-friendly subway - - to my surprise!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#76:1>
I thought Europe 's would be comparable.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#77:1>
Deep inside I was proud & happy that an Asian country beat Europe at
least in that aspect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#78:1>
Incidentally, you ought to be proud of me, too.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#79:1>
I got to my hotel both in Madrid & Paris without having to take a
cab.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#80:1>
I just took the bus and/or the subway, deciphered the city & subway
maps, and <foreign> voila </foreign> , I was there! ( <indig> Nahasa na ako
sa subway sa Tokyo, eh </indig> .)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#81:1>
I was familiar enough with how the subway worked that taking a cab
was no longer necessary even if my location was entirely new.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#82:1>
( Luggage is the only perennial problem.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#83:1>
Although naturally, &ldquo; getting there &rdquo; took me a longer
time than if I were familiar with the place.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#84:1>
Just the same, I found my way <del> <unclear> one word </unclear>
</del> in Madrid & Paris without a hitch & for less cost at that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#85:1>
Travelling alone in a strange place is a good way to heighten &
improve one 's sense of direction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#86:1>
Now I 'm here in Geneve - - so far, the most expensive city I 've
visited in Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#87:1>
Paris is surprisingly even cheaper.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#88:1>
And the conversion rates of French & Swiss <foreign> francs
</foreign> are far from each other.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#89:1>
The yen is relatively strong in both countries though.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#90:1>
The <foreign> yen </foreign> is really powerful; the only Asian
currency acceptable for exchange in Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#91:1>
However, I left Tokyo with at least 5 different, very colorful
currencies in my wallet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#92:1>
With the exception of &yen; and US&dollar;, the rest were alien to
me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#93:1>
Language?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#94:1>
Now that is another thing!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#95:1>
When I got to Madrid, I was still somehow in my <foreign> Nihongo
</foreign> speaking mode so that instead of saying <foreign> &ldquo; Gracias,
&rdquo; </foreign> I caught my self sometimes replying <foreign> &ldquo;
Arigato. &rdquo; </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#96:1>
By the time I had adjusted to Spanish, it was already time to leave
for France.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#97:1>
Suddenly I was already hearing <foreign> &ldquo; Bon Jour &rdquo;
</foreign> and <foreign> &ldquo; Merci &rdquo; </foreign> instead of
<foreign> &ldquo; Hola &rdquo; </foreign> & <foreign> &ldquo; Muchos Gracias.
&rdquo; </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#98:1>
With my <foreign> Nihongo </foreign> , & of course English, still
very much intact in the right hemisphere, my brain was beginning to get a
short circuit with all this very swift shift in language-processing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#99:1>
Thank God, in Geneva, my French &ldquo; lessons &rdquo; get an
extension.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#100:1>
One nice thing about leaving Tokyo for a while though is that
everything I read is again written in Roman alphabets.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#101:1>
I am &ldquo; literate &rdquo; here somehow.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#102:1>
It would probably have been a different experience had I been
travelling with a companion who could speak a language familiar to us both.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#103:1>
But I travelled <ul> alone </ul> for 9 days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#104:1>
Now, there are people to communicate with in both English & Tagalog.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#105:1>
No more danger of getting a brain short circuit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#106:1>
But I still encounter <foreign> Nihongo </foreign> everywhere I go -
the Japs are everywhere in Europe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#107:1>
By the way, you might think I brought everything in cash.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#108:1>
Nope!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#109:1>
( Or else my Canadian friend, Sarah, wouldn't be able to sleep!)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#110:1>
I brought some traveller 's checks, though too.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#111:1>
I didn't have time to apply for a credit card though as I was busy
applying for 5 visas & preparing for my dread oral & written report.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#112:1>
I had to apply for a Turkish transit visa at the last minute, which
the Istanbul airport staff didn't even bother to check.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#113:1>
( <indig> Hay, naku! </indig> )

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#114:1>
I was likewise very busy packing because I checked out of my room.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#115:1>
( I didn't want to pay US&dollar;600 for a room I 'll not occupy for
6 weeks.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#116:1>
I put all my stuff in the dorm 's trunk room instead.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#117:1>
I 'll probably have a new room <del> upon my </del> when I return -
- which I don't mind at all!)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#118:1>
Plus, I had a part-time job until the night before I left.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#119:1>
( <indig> Sagad-sagad talaga!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#120:1>
Matindi! </indig> ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#121:1>
However, I 'm now having a spectacular vacation & enjoying the
fruits of my labor.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#122:1>
Paris was very beautiful!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#123:1>
Madrid was like a mini-Paris.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#124:1>
Geneva 's like home because I could just stare at the walls all day
if I want to.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#125:1>
In <del> front </del> fact, I woke up rather late this morning.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#126:1>
It 's also here where I was able to do my laundry.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#127:1>
I 'll iron my clothes before this day ends. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#128:1>
My friend & I tried this <indig> Pinoy </indig> restaurant
nearby.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#129:1>
Now I have to return because the owner 's daughter wants to
interview me on my philosophical, sociological, <foreign> etc. </foreign>
views on a topic she 's researching on for her thesis <indig> ( yata)
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#130:1>
We had a little discussion already as an introduction.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#131:1>
She casually asked about my opinion over dinner.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#132:1>
But now, she wants a formal, longer & recorded discourse on the
matter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#133:1>
I thought &ldquo; why not? &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#134:1>
So, I agreed to her proposal.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#135:1>
( Well. ... I guess I can never really take a complete break from
philosophy.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#136:1>
I know that both of you have visited Europe, but you never
mentioned anything about having gone to Switzerland.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#137:1>
Have you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#138:1>
This place is so quiet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#139:1>
There are very few cars.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#140:1>
There 's not much tourist attractions but the Swiss chocolates & the
watches are enough to drive one crazy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#141:1>
( The chocolates!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#142:1>
Oh my God!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#143:1>
They look so luscious & tempting!)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#144:1>
If Geneva were only my last stop, I would buy tons & tons of Swiss
chocolates.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#145:1>
But I 'm not even halfway through in my European sojourn.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#146:1>
And the most difficult part of my itinerary is yet to come - -
Italy!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#147:1>
So I guess you 'll just have to &ldquo; put up &rdquo; <del> with
</del> & content yourselves with <mention> Cadbury 's </mention> when I
return in September. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#148:1>
Now, seeing all of you again is something I agogly look forward
to.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#149:1>
I 'm still here & touring Europe but I am already thinking of &
excited about that.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#150:1>
Please don't tell the Abrenicas I 'm taking a vacation there if you
bump into them in church.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#151:1>
Nobody from La Salle knows yet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#152:1>
I want to surprise my friends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#153:1>
I 'll arrive not later than Sept. 4, depending on which flight I 'll
take.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#154:1>
I 'll definitely let you know through Milette via e-mail.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#155:1>
When I return to Tokyo on August 26 or 28, I 'll be harassed & busy
packing again - - this time for the Philippines!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#156:1>
I still remember that thing on papa 's door ( or is it wall?) which
says, <quote> &ldquo; No matter where you may roam, the best part is coming
home. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#157:1>
( INDEED!) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#158:1>
Too bad about the passengers on TWA flight 800!!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#159:1>
As for us, the living, we will continue to <quote> &ldquo; seize the
day. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#160:1>
HOPE YOU 're HAVING A GREAT TIME AS WELL!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#161:1>
Regards to everyone!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#162:1>
SEE YOU ALL IN SEPTEMBER!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#163:1>
And <ul> I MEAN IT </ul> . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#164:1>
Love,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#165:1>
LAUREEN

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-004#166:1>
( P. S. I 'm going outside of Geneva this weekend to see more of
Switzerland.) </p> </I>
