<h> <bold> Total log ban vowed this year </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#21:2>
The government will pursue a total log ban and padlock more
polluting factories this year as it steps up its campaign to check the
<quote> &ldquo; wanton degradation of our natural resources &rdquo; </quote>
and save the environment for future generations, Malaca&ntilde;ang said
yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#22:2>
Reporting on its environment-friendly plans for 1999 and beyond,
Malaca&ntilde;ang said it will strengthen the implementation of its
community-based forest management programs, improve the country 's capacity
for sustainable development of its coastal and marine resources, and
intensify monitoring activities to ensure enforcement of environmental laws
<quote> &ldquo; without regard to stature or political connections of
violators. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#23:2>
The Presidential Management Staff ( PMS), in a recent technical
report, said the national government will revitalize forest-based industries,
enhance private sector investments in the forestry sector, simplify the
Environment Impact Assessment System ( EIAS), and heighten efforts to improve
the quality of air in Metro Manila and other urban centers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#24:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We will pursue a total log ban to protect our
forests ... and sustain our efforts to close down factories that destroy our
environment, &rdquo; </quote> the PMS said in the report. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#25:2>
It added that the Estrada administration will strive this year to
<quote> &ldquo; develop close collaboration and partnership with the private
sector, non-government organizations ( NGOs), and local government units (
LGUs) to promote sustainable development. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#26:2>
In pursuit of President Estrada 's commitment to sustainable
development, the PMS report said that Malaca&ntilde;ang, the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR), and other government agencies
held-over 30 major projects in 1998 in the fields of forest and marine
conservation, air and water pollution control, solid waste management,
regulation of mineral resource exploration, and preservation of biological
diversity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#27:2>
Last year, the Estrada administration <quote> &ldquo; ensured
that the pursuit of economic growth and development would not entail the
wanton degradation of our natural resources, &rdquo; </quote> the PMS report
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#28:2>
<quote> &ldquo; In line with this, we focused our efforts to
promote sustainable development, conservation of our marine and coastal
resources, preservation of biological diversity, strengthening of wildlife
conservation projects, preservation of forest resources, rehabilitation of
watershed, implementation of land management projects, and regulation of the
exploration of mineral resources, &rdquo; </quote> it added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#29:2>
According to the report, the DENR reduced the number of illegal
logging &ldquo; hot spots &rdquo; from 212 last July to 46 last November,
confiscated &ldquo; hot logs &rdquo; worth &peso;54 million, planted a total
forest area of 18,523 hectares from July to October last year, and mobilized
296 multisectoral forest protection committees nationwide to assist the
government in its war against illegal loggers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#30:2>
To revive the dying wood industry, the Estrada administration
identified 200,000 hectares of private land in North east Mindanao 's viable
tree farm centers and another 700,000 hectares in the same areas as a premier
&ldquo; timber corridor, &rdquo; the PMS report said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#31:2>
Also last year, the DENR closed down five firms - - Marigold
Commodities, Dyzum Distillery, Absolut Chemical, Consolidated Distillery and
Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Co. - - for dumping untreated effluents or wastes in
critical waterways, seized 606 highly-endangered animals, canceled or
suspended quarrying permits in Rizal and Pampanga, and asked the Office of
the Solicitor General ( OSG) to cancel 100 fraudulent land titles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#32:2>
<quote> &ldquo; All these highlight our political will to protect
our environment and ensure the proper use and conservation of our natural
resources, &rdquo; </quote> the PMS report said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#33:2>
To counteract the worsening air pollution in the Metropolis, the
PMS said President Estrada created last year, the Presidential Air Quality
Commission to oversee the phaseout of leaded gasoline, as well as the Task
Force on Air Quality, which conducted free tests on diesel engine vehicles
for government agencies and bus companies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#34:2>
In water pollution control, the government launched programs to
rehabilitate the Pasig River and Laguna Lake, intensified the monitoring
activities of 511 water-sampling stations nationwide, and expanded the
coverage of the Environmental User Fee System, which requires industries that
discharge wastewater to help shoulder the cost of rehabilitating the bay.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#35:2>
The PMS said that last year, the DENR forged with the Department
of Tourism an agreement prescribing the guidelines of eco-tourism
development, formulated a &ldquo; Green Globe &rdquo; destination program for
Camiguin Islands, implemented a national biodiversity strategy and action
plan, proclaimed almost 90,000 hectares in the <foreign> El Nido </foreign>
Marine Reserve in Palawan as a protected area, and established the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN) Regional Center for
Biodiversity Conservation in <foreign> Los Ba&ntilde;os </foreign> , Laguna.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#36:2>
To better protect Philippine wildlife, the DENR also initiated
the marine turtle satellite tracking system on Baguan Island, conducted the
first national <indig> <it> dugong </it> </indig> ( sea cow) seminar-workshop
in Davao, formulated the guidelines for the pilot rearing of saltwater
crocodiles, continued field surveys for possible sightings and nest locations
of the endangered Philippine eagle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#37:2>
A total of 606 highly-endangered animals smuggled or sold in pet
shops were confiscated last year.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#38:2>
They included box turtles, Palawan talking mynahs, racket-tailed
parrots, mouse deer, monitor lizards, sailfin lizards, blue-naped parrots,
and green iguanas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-012#39:2>
On watershed protection, the government implemented last year the
water resource development project, and established 975,017 square meters and
2,894 cubic meters for vegetative and engineering structures, respectively,
to prevent soil erosion and stabilize land contours. </p> </I>
