<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#1:1:A>
We start on the pretext that uh language testing practices uh have always emanated from language teaching practices
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#2:1:A>
It 's the uh it 's usually the case that language testing has always followed language teaching traditions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#3:1:A>
It has never been the other way around
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#4:1:A>
It 's not although Allan Davis in one of his articles once uh hinted that maybe the time uh should come when language testing should dictate language teaching trends
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#5:1:A>
I don't know when that would happen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#6:1:A>
It hasn't happened <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#7:1:A>
Anyway we 'll start with uhm developments in language teaching or language education in general because it is those developments that have influenced uh proponents in language testing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#8:1:A>
To conceive the way they did they 've done
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#9:1:A>
So to think of uh the one of the first notions of language uh the acquisition of language in that is that it 's structural
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#10:1:A>
So we uh the first developments of linguistics is uh structuralism
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#11:1:A>
The first considered uh considered to be the first school of linguistics among the first is uh the thought about the structuralism and growth of language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#12:1:A>
Meaning to say that language is uh predominantly the concern with language is its form not so much on its meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#13:1:A>
Meaning is there only as a crutch to the form that we understand as a form <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#14:1:A>
Uh the view is that language is a system of habits of communication
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#15:1:A>
And habits of communication consist of four linguistic layers the sound layer the phonology the morphological layer the word structure the syntactical layer the sentence structure and the lexical layer or lexicon or the vocabulary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#16:1:A>
So it is uh anyone who wishes to learn a language must concentrate on these four layers of language sequentially uh uh in sequence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#17:1:A>
You start out learning the sounds and then when you 're ready I mean you have acquired the sounds you 're ready for the next higher level which is the words word structure
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#18:1:A>
And when you 're ready for the word uh you have mastered the word structure then you can proceed to the sentence structures and so on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#19:1:A>
So you don't uh uh like the notion in descriptive linguistics where you 'd have to start out with the sound system
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#20:1:A>
The written is only secondary and it 's the oral that is of <.> prim </.> primary importance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#21:1:A>
So once you have acquired and have mastered what you 've heard then you 're ready to speak
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#22:1:A>
That 's why uh uh in structuralism the language teaching methodology that predominated uhm which is based on structuralist view of language is the audio lingual method which is audio listen lingual speak
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#23:1:A>
So listen first then speak
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#24:1:A>
That 's why it 's called audio lingual or in other words <,> aural oral approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#25:1:A>
So these two are they mean the same the uh the uh approach to the learning of language through the sound system first and then when you have uh mastered the sound system you 're ready to speak <,> then you 're ready to read and lastly to write
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#26:1:A>
That is why with the audio lingual method they they emphasize on the neat sequence of L S R W <&> the teacher writes on the board </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#27:1:A>
Listen speak read and write
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#28:1:A>
Never alter the sequence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#29:1:A>
When you teach a language you always have to discuss listening first then speaking then reading and writing <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#30:1:A>
Then uhm of course there are other methods of teaching language that uh became known like <mention> suggestopedia </mention> like the <mention> total physical response approach </mention> <mention> the direct method </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#31:1:A>
Of course before everything a before the uh even <mention> the structural approach </mention> you have the uh the uh <mention> grammar translation approach </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#32:1:A>
We learned it that way first in our time as uh young learners in school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#33:1:A>
We learned through the grammar translation approach first and then uh then I think when we were in the intermediate grades that was when the structure approach uh became prominent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#34:1:A>
I mean as far as I am as far as I can remember we started to learn language through the grammar translation approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#35:1:A>
Then you had uh <,,> what 's this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#36:1:A>
The silent way approach uhm <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#37:1:B>
C L L

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#38:1:C>
Community Language Learning

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#39:1:A>
C L L yes community language learning

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#40:1:C>
Notional functional approach

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#41:1:A>
And then the notional functional approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#42:1:A>
So I think I emphasize that even though I say there are other methods that developed after the audio lingual method <,> or the aural oral uh approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#43:1:A>
Then in between we had <&> the teacher writes on the board </&> T P R we had suggestopedia we had C L L we had silent way direct method and whatever else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#44:1:A>
Then prominent the next prominent kind of method of language teaching was the notional <,> functional approach <&> the teacher writes on the board </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#45:1:A>
Now why why do we distinguish this from the previous what is the uh legacy of the notional functional approach in uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#46:1:A>
Does anybody know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#47:1:B>
Meaning

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#48:1:A>
Meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#49:1:A>
Here we think of A L M as focusing on

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#50:1:B>
Form

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#51:1:A>
Form then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#52:1:B>
Meaning

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#53:1:A>
Meaning is there only as uh an aid there to the understanding of form
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#54:1:A>
Now came the notional functional approach which emphasized

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#55:1:B>
Meaning

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#56:1:A>
Meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#57:1:A>
Uh in fact form was out of the question
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#58:1:A>
If you recall uh during the era that uh concentrated on the notional functional approach they say it didn't matter how you speak that language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#59:1:A>
It didn't matter how you listen to the language what matters is whether you used you put across the message the meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#60:1:A>
And and what matters is you understood what you 've heard or what you 've read
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#61:1:A>
Never mind grammar
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#62:1:A>
Uh that was uh the uh <,> outstanding feature of the notional functional approach is that it concentrated too much on meaning to the neglect of grammar
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#63:1:A>
That is why I remember that of uh the proponent of uh the notional functional approach was David Wilkins <&> teacher writes on the board </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#64:1:A>
The notional functional approach is a British tradition and uh David Wilkins himself realized the shortcomings of the notional functional approach in that because of too much emphasis on meaning the <.> con </.> the result was uh poor grammar
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#65:1:A>
So it that that was a bleak uh fate for grammar
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#66:1:A>
That is why David Wilkins was among the first to because he realized the shortcoming of the notional functional approach he was the early proponent of communicative teaching
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#67:1:A>
So together with this uh <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#68:1:C>
Widdowson

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#69:1:A>
Widdowson they collaborated to uh <,> develop the communicative approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#70:1:A>
So we can say that the notional functional approach is uh a springboard to the development of the communicative approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#71:1:A>
Of of course the communicative approach is so unlike also the the previous in that this one says form first than meaning 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#72:1:A>
Meaning first never mind form
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#73:1:A>
Then with the communicative approach <&> the teacher writes on the board </&> meaning first plus <&> students answer </&> form <,> right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#74:1:A>
So it is form then meaning meaning never mind form then meaning first then form 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#75:1:A>
So you recall that uhm it was important to note functions of language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#76:1:A>
Functions they must have meaning I mean a message function
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#77:1:A>
How do you function in language is not so much the understanding of form but more on the usage the use of form to function in language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#78:1:A>
That 's the thrust of the communicative approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#79:1:A>
It 's not so much that you know so much in structure but whether you can perform the structure that you know <,> effectively
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#80:1:A>
So function first is identified then the relevant grammar or language forms that go with every function will be identified
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#81:1:A>
In in essence that 's the communicative approach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#82:1:A>
Identify the meaning first the function first and then identify the form that goes with the function
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#83:1:A>
Can you recall uhm John Oller who was one of the first uh linguists who said that uhm you recall Oller was a proponent of integrated testing integrated testing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#84:1:A>
He said uh <,> anyone can score ninety-five percent or even one hundred percent in a language or grammar test but that is no guarantee that that person who scored so high in a language test can ever function in a language can ever perform you know the extent that he knows of the form of language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#85:1:A>
So what was more important then I think that was the beginnings of the realization that what was more important was not knowledge of form but the ability to function with that knowledge of form
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#86:1:A>
So Oller 's I think is pivotal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#87:1:A>
Oller 's view of a distinction between integrated <.> test </.> testing and <.> in </.> discrete point testing was pivotal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#88:1:A>
Many people realize that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#89:1:A>
Really if you think of it yeah someone can be very good at grammar someone can be very good at you know uh performing in written paper and pencil test but you cannot be <.> ve </.> very sure that that person can really use the language
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#90:1:A>
So in we use another uh nomenclature we say we need form use usage
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#91:1:A>
I recall Dell Hymes one of the early anthropological linguists who really exerted a lot of influence uh in the developments of social linguistics who said <quote> there are rules of use without which rules of usage would be useless </quote> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#92:1:A>
So I think I have said already in the in this the same class minus the two of you the two anecdotes that I 've had to really uh exemplify the importance of what Dell Hymes said
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#93:1:A>
Uhm I recall a friend uh we we just graduated from teaching from P N U
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#94:1:A>
She was assigned to her school in <.> Antipo </.> Antipolo Rizal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#95:1:A>
My friend is a beauty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#96:1:A>
And until now she 's still a beauty <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#97:1:A>
The American Peace Corps volunteer before he came to the Philippines had a crash course in Tagalog in Sacramento California
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#98:1:A>
So he was really well-armed linguistically
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#99:1:A>
He knew that uh the kind of Tagalog that he need he needed to uh get along with uh teachers in Antipolo Rizal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#100:1:A>
Naturally when he that American Peace Corps volunteer first saw my friend he was attracted <indig> kasi nga </indig> beauty <indig> eh </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#101:1:A>
Uh pardon me Lin uh Shaolin I said something in Tagalog okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#102:1:A>
So he said can I visit you tonight 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#103:1:A>
Of course my friend was elated that he would be visited by an American she would be visited by an American 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#104:1:A>
So anyway that night it was a <,> a celebration of sorts in the neighborhood
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#105:1:A>
Because at that time it was a big thing to have an American for a suitor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#106:1:A>
And you know in the provinces the houses are built such that you have a balcony <,> and the balcony is the place where suitors are entertained
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#107:1:A>
I think for the reason that <O> laughter </O> if anybody sees you there you cannot do hanky panky you cannot do some foolishness there 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#108:1:A>
So they were there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#109:1:A>
My friend was entertaining the American Peace Corps volunteer in the balcony at the house
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#110:1:A>
Now <.> sev </.> he came at seven o'clock <,> eight o'clock no move
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#111:1:A>
In the provinces the rule is you visit only for an hour no less uh no more I mean no more

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#112:1:D>
Go home <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#113:1:A>
And then you go home <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#114:1:A>
So the American was not aware of this rule
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#115:1:A>
He stayed on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#116:1:A>
My friend of course was aware of this rule but she was willing to violate the rule
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#117:1:A>
Because she was enjoying the Peace Corps volunteer 's company
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#118:1:A>
Nine o'clock came
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#119:1:A>
Still no move to leave
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#120:1:A>
The two were enjoying themselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#121:1:A>
The parents were getting uh <,> <O> laughter </O> panicky
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#122:1:A>
What would the neighbors say 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#123:1:A>
You know why are we tolerating this 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#124:1:A>
But of course my my friend 's parents did not know English
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#125:1:A>
And again even if they knew English in the provinces they are very timid they will not uh venture to they would not venture to be offensive to the guest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#126:1:A>
Anyway so they were panicky inside
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#127:1:A>
My friend and the the Peace Corps were enjoying themselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#128:1:A>
Ten o'clock came still no move to leave
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#129:1:A>
At that point really the my friend 's parents were really really uh very embarrassed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#130:1:A>
What the neighbors would say
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#131:1:A>
Eleven o'clock <O> laughter </O> no move to leave no move no move to leave at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#132:1:A>
And this of course the American did not have in his training
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#133:1:A>
He wasn't trained for social meanings
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#134:1:A>
He was trained only for linguistic meanings
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#135:1:A>
And so at when eleven o'clock came and still the American Peace Corps volunteer was not to leave uhm making move to leave my uh my my my friend 's parents started to do paralinguistic signs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#136:1:A>
Because they could not they didn't know English
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#137:1:A>
They were again uh not very confident with what they the little English that they knew
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#138:1:A>
So my one of them started to to close with a bang the window within view of the balcony with a bang
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#139:1:A>
No effect <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#140:1:A>
The American did not know that <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#141:1:A>
Then next they did was to roll a mat <,> in the <indig> sala </indig> again within view of the balcony
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#142:1:A>
No effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#143:1:A>
Then they turned off the lights in the <indig> sala </indig> not not in the balcony yet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#144:1:A>
Still no effect <,> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#145:1:C>
Your friend was deliberately ignoring these

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#146:1:A>
She was <.> deliberate </.> she was willing to be reprimanded to be scolded later
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#147:1:A>
So <,> uh I think that was the last straw
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#148:1:A>
They were really exasperated <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#149:1:A>
So my my friend 's mother approached my friend
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#150:1:A>
It was really uh too much already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#151:1:A>
They reached the point where they could no longer <.> tol </.> tolerate the Peace Corps volunteer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#152:1:A>
So my friend 's mother went to her <,> and pinched <O> laughter </O> her ear one of the ears

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#153:1:C>
Paralinguistic <indig> pa rin 'yan </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#154:1:A>
<indig> Oo </indig> paralinguistic <indig> pa rin 'yan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-015#155:1:A>
So my friend said you better go now <O> laughter </O> 

 </I>
