 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#15:1:A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#16:1:B>
 Since he 's gonna join with the Rookie of the Year of nineteen ninety-six

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#17:1:A>
 Who 's that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#18:1:B>
 Stoudamire

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#19:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#20:1:B>
 Yeah and it 's an all-star cast Rashered Wallace uhm Sabonis

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#21:1:A>
 Do you think Sabonis is good

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#22:1:B>
 That is one uhm seven footer

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#23:1:A>
 He 's good I think he 's so slow for a basketball player

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#24:1:B>
 <indig> Ay </indig> he does well he 's okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#25:1:A>
 Does he make a lot of shots

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#26:1:B>
 No but he does a lot of you know blocking and he can run faster

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#27:1:A>
 Oh <{> <[> for a center for his size </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#28:1:B>
 <[> Yeah for a big guy </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#29:1:B>
 For a guy like him yeah and he can even dunk <unclear> word </unclear> and maneuvering within the paint

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#30:1:A>
 Oh how old how old is he Sabonis how old is he

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#31:1:B>
 I think he 's about he was a rookie with he was already in his thirties

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#32:1:A>
 And what year was that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#33:1:B>
 Uh that was way back in nineteen ninety-five ninety-six

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#34:1:A>
 Nineteen ninety-five

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#35:1:B>
 Yeah ninety-five ninety-six

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#36:1:A>
 So I guess he 's still young <{> <[> as a center </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#37:1:B>
 <[> Yeah he 's still young </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#38:1:A>
 Uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#39:1:B>
 And and you know a lot of rookies nowadays just popped out from high school Kobe Bryant

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#40:1:A>
 Uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#41:1:B>
 Like Kevin Garnett

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#42:1:A>
 Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#43:1:B>
 They just popped out of high school no more college

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#44:1:A>
 Do you think that Portland <,> that Portland has a chance of winning the championship

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#45:1:B>
 Uh definitely

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#46:1:A>
 Why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#47:1:B>
 This season yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#48:1:A>
 Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#49:1:A>
 What makes you think so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#50:1:B>
 There 's no more Jordan and the Spurs are not that that powerful

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#51:1:A>
 But the Lakers have the best record
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#52:1:A>
 So what do you say about that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#53:1:B>
 Uh well there 's Phil Jackson and but I don't think 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#54:1:B>
 It 's a it 's Phil Jackson with a new team so <,> he it 's still like a dry-run for him okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#55:1:A>
 Uh uh <indig> ay </indig> you know I heard the news about Rodman coming back to the N B A
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#56:1:A>
 Have you heard of that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#57:1:B>
 Yeah I 've heard that he 's not gonna have any more fancy hairstyle no more tattoos no more earrings and all that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#59:1:B>
 He wants to be a good boy now not a bad boy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#60:1:A>
 Do you mean to say that she he had his tattoos removed <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#61:1:B>
 <O> cough </O> His tattoos removed well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#62:1:A>
 He had it erased

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#63:1:B>
 I heard it from one one of my friends that he 's going to be taking all those bad boy stuffs off

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#64:1:A>
 Why what 's what

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#65:1:B>
 Because he wants to be a good boy now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#66:1:A>
 What triggered the change in his heart or change in mind

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#67:1:B>
 Perhaps his being in jail and all that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#68:1:A>
 Oh who 's this does he have a wife now

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#69:1:B>
 Yeah is that a right choice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#70:1:A>
 I think they 're already divorced

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#71:1:B>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#80:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#> No honestly just a few days ago I saw it I saw it in a newspaper he 's planning to buy a slot or a portion of the Washington Wizards

<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#82:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#84:1:B>
 You know he 's a businessman right now after his retirement

<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#85:1:A>
 But but Portland is your favorite team

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#86:1:B>
 Yeah Portland then I guess after Portland that would be <,> uhm <,> that would be Sacramento

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#87:1:A>
 Sacramento Kings
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#88:1:A>
 Why why the Sacramento

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#93:1:A>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#94:1:B>
 With all those assists those passes incredible positions after Earvin Johnson

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#95:1:A>
 Yeah something like I I 'm also playing basketball and I 'm trying to figure out how he does those things and he 's so great he 's just so good to become

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#96:1:B>
 Actually last year he was a candidate for Rookie of the Year

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#97:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#98:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#168:1:A>
 Well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#169:1:B>
 Uh you know in in card collecting you you know it 's gone down with the popularity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#170:1:B>
 It 's gone down I don't think because of Magic or because I think it 's because of you know the resignation of Jordan

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#171:1:A>
 That 's the reason why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#172:1:B>
 I think that 's primarily the reason

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#173:1:A>
 Probably probably it 's because of Pokemon <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#174:1:B>
 <{> <[> Uh </[> urhhh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#175:1:A>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#178:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#179:1:B>
 In Pokemon no one dies I mean no no one you know cuts off his arm no bloodshed

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#180:1:A>
 Uh yeah yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#181:1:B>
 It 's it 's like uh a very very mild portrayal of violence

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#182:1:A>
 Yeah some something good about Pokemon is that it doesn't portray portray too much of violence and <,,> gore 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#183:1:B>
 If you ask me it 's for for girls you know

<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#200:1:B>
 He looks like <{> <[> Pikachu but </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#201:1:A>
 <[> Yeah </[> </{> he looks like Pikachu
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#202:1:A>
 He is the evolved yeah Raichu is the evolved version of the of Pikachu

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#203:1:B>
 But <,> being evolved there are two distinct uh <,> Pokemons right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#204:1:A>
 Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#205:1:B>
 Like I saw Pikachu and Raichu fighting

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#206:1:A>
 Yeah but then like because there are many Pikachus actually

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#207:1:B>
 Uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#208:1:B>
 <indig> Ha </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#209:1:A>
 Yeah there are many Pikachus
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#210:1:A>
 If you have if you saw the cartoon last night uhm there were many Pikachus okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#211:1:A>
 So one tends to evolve to a Raichu or one can just choose to remain as a Pikachu
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#212:1:A>
 That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#213:1:A>
 How about

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#214:1:B>
 Uh primetime man I speak of Voltes Five and Daimos

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#215:1:A>
 Voltes Five
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#216:1:A>
 Now who 's the better robot <,> Voltes Five or Daimos

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#218:1:B>
 Wait uh <,> I can't you know tell

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#219:1:A>
 Something like

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#220:1:B>
 I like I like Daimos because of his <,> what 's that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#221:1:A>
 Blizzard

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#222:1:B>
 Uh or his death blow <,> and his blizzard yeah he had this snow blizzard

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#223:1:A>
 Snow blizzard

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#224:1:B>
 Yeah at the end he had all these sorts of you know weapons snow blizzard and then the what 's this uh fire blizzard

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#225:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#226:1:B>
 Yeah <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#227:1:A>
 What do you think
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#228:1:A>
 Okay something like <,> what if Daimos and Voltes Five are going to fight

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#229:1:B>
 Uh they can't fight because they 're both good robots

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#230:1:A>
 No something like <,> uhm they used the ones you usually read in Marvel Comics you see the Incredible Hulk fighting the Spiderman <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#231:1:B>
 That 's no problem because that 's Marvel

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#232:1:A>
 So about

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#233:1:B>
 Though I think what you were trying to say is D C against Marvel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#234:1:B>
 They 're two separate companies

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#235:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#236:1:B>
 With two different heroes fighting each other

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#237:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#238:1:B>
 Yeah so with Daimos and Voltes Five

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#239:1:A>
 Who do you think is going to win <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#240:1:B>
 Oh boy well Voltes Five is a five-man team <O> laughter </O> five-man <.> ro </.> robot and Daimos is only one but I think it 's evenly matched

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#241:1:A>
 Evenly matched <,> with the weapons who do you think has

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#242:1:B>
 Has more weapons

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#243:1:A>
 Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#244:1:B>
 I think it 's Daimos

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#245:1:A>
 Daimos

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#246:1:B>
 Has a lot more weapons

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#247:1:A>
 Than Voltes Five

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#248:1:B>
 Yeah the problem with Voltes Five is you know there is five heads working altogether

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#249:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#250:1:B>
 Daimos has only one head

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#251:1:A>
 Why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#252:1:B>
 So I guess he 's more focused

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#253:1:A>
 What made it a problem for Voltes Five having these five going around

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#254:1:B>
 Uh one head <?> chews the other </?> <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#255:1:A>
 Now let 's go back to basketball

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#256:1:B>
 Uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#257:1:A>
 About the P B A

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#258:1:B>
 P B A

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#259:1:A>
 What 's your favorite team <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#260:1:B>
 A long time ago it used to be San Miguel Beer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#261:1:B>
 That 's the time when I really liked watching P B A

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#262:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#263:1:B>
 With Brown uhm <,> who was that Samboy Lim with Teng with Caidic

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#265:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#266:1:B>
 Yeah they were the dream team for the Philippines

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#267:1:A>
 How about the present San Miguel team
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#268:1:A>
 How do you assess them

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#269:1:B>
 I think they won the the last conference

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#270:1:A>
 Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#271:1:B>
 <{> <[> Or no </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#272:1:A>
 <[> Actually </[> </{> the last two conferences they won it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#273:1:B>
 Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#274:1:A>
 Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#275:1:B>
 Two

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#276:1:A>
 Yeah uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#277:1:B>
 Uh by the way do you know who the players are already in San Miguel

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#278:1:A>
 Line-up

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#279:1:B>
 Yeah line-up

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#280:1:A>
 Well uhm <,,> I guess uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#281:1:A>
 Hey somebody is writing something on the board

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#282:1:B>
 Yeah I don't know what he 's writing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#283:1:A>
 Anyway <,> oh the guy already left anyway <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#284:1:A>
 Oh let 's uhm how about <,> Chicago Bulls
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#285:1:A>
 What do you think
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#286:1:A>
 Do you feel sorry about the Chicago Bulls for <{> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#287:1:B>
 <[> Yeah </[> </{> I mean it started out with a dream you know when when Chicago their dream was to get three-peat the three-peat

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#288:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#289:1:B>
 Yeah so once that dream was you know was came came to when they achieved that dream and then the uh I think the manager decided on having a new team uh no uh a team with new players to have a new target or <{> <[> <,> </[> goal

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#290:1:A>
 <[> I guess </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#292:1:A>
 I guess the team had already reached the point when uh something like we 're already at the top <{> <[> of the world </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#293:1:B>
 <[> Yeah </[> </{> there is nothing more to <{> <[> to gain </[> <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#294:1:A>
 <[> After </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#295:1:A>
 Something like we are we are the best in the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#296:1:A>
 There 's no other way but to go down
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#297:1:A>
 We 've already reached the top
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#298:1:A>
 Probably they came to that point already and now they 're languishing at the bottom

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#299:1:B>
 Yeah well they 're already going down
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#300:1:B>
 They 're already at the bottom really <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#301:1:B>
 In terms of <.> statisti </.> statistical you know outcome in the they 're really at the bottom <{> <[> Chicago Bulls </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#303:1:A>
 <[> Chicago Bulls </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#304:1:B>
 And they just have two wins four wins out of how many games

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#305:1:A>
 I guess I guess they already have five wins just imagine five wins

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#306:1:B>
 Out of thirty forty forty games something like that 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#> You know I think some of the core some of the line-up of last year was were still retained like Kukoch

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#307:1:A>
 Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#308:1:B>
 Like Brown

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#309:1:A>
 Ray Brown

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#310:1:B>
 Randy <.> B </.> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-001#311:1:A>
 I guess it 's Randy Brown 

 </I>
