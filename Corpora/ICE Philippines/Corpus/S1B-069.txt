<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#1:1:A>
Yes uh what is the pleasure of the Honorable Judge uh Drilon

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#2:1:B>
Yes uh this is in relation to the letter read by the Senate President uh Mr Chief Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#3:1:B>
If I may while we are waiting for the <,> before we start with the next witness Your Honor 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#> Uh the Senate President read into the record the documents uh which uh witness Carissa Ocampo mentioned <{> <[> in the course of </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#4:1:A>
<[> Clarissa </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#5:1:B>
Clarissa Ocampo mentioned in the course of her testimony and indeed she said that she was going to produce these documents before this Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#6:1:B>
Uh first uh can the members of the court have copies of this uh uh second set of documents testified to by Mrs Ocampo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#7:1:B>
And uh second uh Your Honor may we know if this is considered now as part of the testimony of Mrs Ocampo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#8:1:A>
The Chair would rule as to the first copies thereof will be given to the members of uh the court
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#10:1:A>
As to the second uh I think uh it might not be proper to consider it as part of the testimony of the witness taking into account that uh if you recall Your Honor there was a reservation earlier made by the Honorable uh Senator-Judge Roco for the production of the document the following day and uh the witness was supposed to come or to return to the witness stand the following day for that purpose
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#11:1:A>
But I understand that Senator Roco uh withdrew the reservation later on after conferring with Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#12:1:B>
That is why we raised that question Your Honor precisely because I recall the manifestation of uh Senator Roco and uh I was the one who initially asked for these documents and Atty Roco precisely uh mentioned it also in the course of his intervention 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#13:1:B>
That is why I raised the issue <{> <[> <,> </[> as a matter of guidance for the members of this court Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#14:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#16:1:A>
Thank you Your Honor

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#17:1:C>
Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#18:1:A>
The Honorable uh Prosecutor Apostol

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#19:1:C>
May we pray for <.> substituting </.> substitution of the assisting counsel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#20:1:C>
Instead of yours truly may we request that the assisting counsel be Dean Amado Valdez and uh private counsels for the witnesses
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#21:1:C>
May I turn over now the <{> <[> microphone </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#22:1:A>
<[> Prosecutor </[> </{> Libarios may now proceed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#23:1:A>
The the witness uh is warned that uh she would be testifying under the same oath

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#24:1:D>
May I now proceed uh Mr Chief Justice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#25:1:A>
You may now proceed

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#26:1:D>
Uh Ms Witness yesterday you testified uh before this honorable uh Impeachment Court that sometime in October of nineteen ninety-nine you were asked to sign two uh Articles of Incorporation namely Pio Holding Corporation and Alexie Holding Corporation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#27:1:D>
When these uh Articles were presented for your signature did you have any participation in the preparation and drafting of these Articles of Incorporation and the other documents

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#28:1:E>
No the documents were all prepared
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#29:1:E>
Uh in fact uh incorporation papers already contained the signatures of the other lawyers

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#30:1:D>
You also mentioned that it was upon the request of uh Atty Serapio coursed through the uh secretary and the assistant uh Atty Michael de los Reyes that you acted on the uh Articles of Incorporation of these two corporations 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#31:1:D>
Now at the time you signed these Articles of Incorporation was Atty Serapio already connected in Malaca&ntilde;ang

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#32:1:E>
Uh Your Honor I believe he was already uh appointed Presidential Adviser

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#33:1:D>
Now after signing the Articles of Incorporation of the Pio Holdings and the Alexie Holdings what did you do if any

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#34:1:E>
After signing

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#35:1:D>
After signing

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#36:1:E>
Well I uhm I remember uh Atty de los Reyes went back to me so I gave uh I gave the documents back to him as uh completely signed

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#37:1:D>
Based on the uh Articles of Incorporation you appear to be one of the incorporators one of the five incorporators and one of the five members of the Board
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#38:1:D>
Aside from these uh two positions uh what other positions did you hold in these two corporations if any

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#39:1:E>
Well uh in the incorporation papers it was also stated there that I was uh Corporate Secretary

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#40:1:D>
Okay now uh when these incorporation papers were presented to you and one of the papers mentioned that you are a Corporate Secretary were you previously consulted that you will be listed as one as the Corporate Secretary of these two corporations

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#41:1:E>
Uh no Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#42:1:D>
May I call your attention uh Ms Witness to these uh two exhibits uh Exhibits quadruple E and quadruple F referring to uh two certificates two secretary 's certificates <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#43:1:D>
I would like you to examine carefully uh these two uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#44:1:A>
You cannot be heard uh Mr Counsel

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#45:1:D>
I 'd like you to examine carefully these two uh secretary 's certificates dated uh October nineteen ninety-nine uh bearing identical entries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#46:1:D>
Would you uh confirm that you signed these two uh secretary 's certificates

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#47:1:E>
Yes I signed these uh certificates the same day I signed the incorporation papers

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#48:1:D>
In this uh secretary 's certificate uh duly marked Exhibit quadruple E

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#49:1:A>
Louder please <&> speaker D blows into the microphone </&> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#50:1:D>
In this secretary 's certificate <,,> secretary certificate uh duly marked as Exhibit quadruple E there appears an entry which states that the corporation is authorized to negotiate for the purchase of the shares of stocks of R N Development Corporation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#51:1:D>
At the time you signed this uh certificate secretary 's certificate did you know that R N Development Corporation was actually the owner operator of the Fontana Leisure Parks

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#52:1:F>
No no basis whatsoever Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#53:1:A>
The objection is sustained no basis

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#55:1:D>
Okay uh did you have any prior knowledge about this R N Development Corporation when you signed this secretary 's certificate

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#56:1:E>
None Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#57:1:D>
And uh let me call your attention also to the next paragraph after that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#58:1:D>
It states here that uh Resolved that the Acting Executive Vice-President uh Mr Leonardo B Dayao is authorized to negotiate sign execute and deliver for and in behalf of the corporation all the documents necessary to effect the foregoing resolution particularly the purchase of the R N Development Corporation 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#59:1:D>
When you signed this secretary 's certificate did you know this <.> Assist </.> Acting Executive Vice-President Mr Leonardo B Dayao who was authorized to negotiate for the purchase of uh the R N Development Corporation

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#60:1:F>
Your Honor please the question is irrelevant uh precisely the resolution authorizes uh the axec Executive Vice-President to to negotiate to sign and execute in behalf of the corporation relating to the purchase of the shares

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#61:1:A>
The objection uh is sustained but not for the reason given but uh for the reason that the best evidence is the document itself

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#62:1:D>
Your Honor please uh what we are trying to this is a motion for reconsideration Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#64:1:D>
What the prosecution is trying to establish now is that these corporations are nothing but dummy corporations set up <{> <[> to acquire the R N Development Corporation </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#65:1:A>
<[> Then go direct to the point </[> </{> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#66:1:D>
And Your Honor please <,> while it is true that the document is the best evidence but whether or not the Corporate Secretary knows the identity of this <.> cert </.> Leonardo B Dayao is an independently relevant statement Your Honor that transcends beyond the existence of this particular document

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#67:1:A>
So you are offering the same as an independently relevant statement

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#68:1:D>
Yes Your Honor it has a significance

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#69:1:A>
Uh then with more reason that the objection should be sustained
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#70:1:A>
Go direct to the point

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#71:1:D>
Your Honor please uh we would uh I would like to uh make a particular tender of proof in this particular case Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#72:1:A>
Make the tender of proof

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#73:1:D>
That if the witness is asked about this Atty Leonardo B Dayao the witness does not actually know this person who was authorized in this document as the uh person to negotiate for the purchase of the R N Development Corporation and she does not know anything about this particular purchase Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#74:1:A>
Let the proffer of proof stay on record

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#75:1:D>
Now aside from these two documents the uh Alexie Holdings Incorporated which were already identified yesterday and uh stipulations were already made as to the existence of these two documents and of course including the authenticity of the signatures I presume of these uh two documents <,> both for the Alexie Holdings Incorporated and the uh Pio Holdings uh Corporation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#77:1:D>
Now aside from these documents uh Ms Witness can you uh tell us if you executed any other document in relation to these two corporations

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#78:1:E>
Yes I also signed uh blank deed of assignment

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#79:1:D>
What do you mean by <mention> blank deed of assignment </mention> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#80:1:E>
The the name of the assignee and the date of the document were uh both left in blanks

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#81:1:D>
And uh what did you assign in in those blank deed of assignments

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#82:1:F>
The best evidence is the document

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#83:1:A>
There is an objection

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#84:1:F>
The best evidence is the document

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#85:1:A>
Sustained

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#86:1:D>
Your Honor please uh we do not have the documents right now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#87:1:A>
Then lay the basis for the for uh evidence tending toward that direction

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#88:1:D>
You said that uh you signed a blank deed of assignments
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#89:1:D>
Where is that document indicating uh your signature in that blank deed of assignments

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#90:1:F>
Same objection Your Honor <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#91:1:F>
Where is the signature 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#92:1:F>
Obviously it 's in the document

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#93:1:D>
Where is the document now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#94:1:A>
Uhm the Chair should first make a ruling
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#95:1:A>
Sustained
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#96:1:A>
Make another question

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#97:1:D>
Uh Ms uh Witness you testified earlier that you signed a blank deed of assignment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#98:1:D>
Now my question is uh where is that document now that blank deed of assignment

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#99:1:E>
I do not know Your Honor

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#100:1:D>
After you signed that blank deed of assignment to whom did you turn over that blank deed of assignment

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#101:1:E>
Also to Atty Michael de los Reyes

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#102:1:D>
And what did you assign in those uh blank deed of assignments

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#103:1:F>
The best evidence is the document <O> chuckle </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#104:1:A>
Sustained

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#105:1:D>
Your Honor please uh considering

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#106:1:A>
The the Chair will not recommend to you what to do but you know how to establish secondary evidence whenever the document cannot be produced

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#107:1:D>
That is correct Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#108:1:D>
We have already laid down the basis that the documents are in the possession of Atty Michael de los Reyes and this Atty Michael de los Reyes is actually working as an <.> asses </.> assistant of Atty Edward Serapio
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#109:1:D>
So we cannot produce these documents right now Your Honor and we are still in the process <{> <[> of </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#110:1:A>
<[> You </[> </{> were the one saying it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#111:1:A>
Let it come from the witness so you could ask for the next question

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#112:1:D>
That is why Your Honor <,> our next our last question was what did you assign in in the blank deed of assignments 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#113:1:F>
Even if it is well objectionable I will not object anymore so that <{> <[> since this is supposed to be the last question </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#114:1:A>
<[> The objection is withdrawn </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#115:1:A>
The witness may now answer the question

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#116:1:D>
What did you assign

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#117:1:E>
I assigned my shares uh in the two companies

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#118:1:D>
How about the other incorporators
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#119:1:D>
Did you know if they also executed similar deed of assignments over the shares in the uh corporation

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#120:1:E>
I would assume that they uh also signed those uh documents

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#121:1:D>
What do you mean <mention> I would assume </mention> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#122:1:E>
The normal practice in that law firm was for the in case the lawyers were to act as incorporators they would sign the incorporation documents simultaneously with the deeds of trust
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#123:1:E>
So I would assume that that was what happened in this case

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#124:1:D>
Now after the corporations were registered and you mentioned also that uh you were the incorporator and a member of the Board in these two corporations now uh can you recall if you were notified of any meeting or activity of these two corporations

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#125:1:E>
Well after I signed those documents I was not notified of any further activity or event

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#126:1:D>
And you also mentioned that you were <.> assign </.> also designated as a Corporate Secretary of these two corporations and uh do you remember if you executed a document in relation to your being Corporate Secretary of these two corporations

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#127:1:E>
Uhm when I resigned from the law firm of uh De Borja Medialdea I also tendered my resignation as Corporate Secretary for the two corporations

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#129:1:D>
And to whom did you submit your letter of resignation as Corporate Secretary
 
 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#130:1:E>
I submitted them to Atty de los Reyes

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#131:1:D>
Thank that is all for the witness Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#133:1:A>
Cross-examination

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#134:1:F>
Uh with the permission of the court uh Atty Banal uh for how long did you work uh with the law office of De Borja Medialdea

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#135:1:E>
I worked there for one year and eight months

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#136:1:F>
And uh you were assigned to the Corporate Department

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#137:1:E>
Yes Your Honor

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#138:1:F>
And uh in that Corporate Department uh it is uh usual practice to prepare Articles of Incorporation in which members of the firm are named as incorporators and as members of the Board is it not

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#139:1:E>
Yes Your Honor

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#140:1:F>
And uh so what you did in this particular case is uh usual practice in that firm

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#141:1:E>
Yes Your Honor

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#142:1:F>
And that uh when a client comes and then uh needs a corporation uh uh corporations which had been previously organized are made available is it not 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#143:1:E>
Yes Your Honor

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#144:1:F>
And that when the client uh decides to utilize that corporation all of the members of the firm who were designated incorporators and members of the Board uh execute deeds of assignment in favor of the nominees of the client is it not

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#145:1:E>
Yes

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#146:1:F>
And that is usual and standard practice

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#147:1:E>
Yes

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#148:1:F>
Nothing wrong with that is it not

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#149:1:E>
None

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#150:1:F>
You would not engage in anything that is illegal is it not

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#151:1:E>
No

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#152:1:F>
And that is that is perfectly legal is it not

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#153:1:E>
The incorporation yes

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#155:1:F>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#156:1:F>
Thank you very much
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#157:1:F>
No more no further questions

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#158:1:A>
Any questions from the members of the Impeachment Court

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#159:1:D>
Two re-direct questions Your Honor

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#160:1:A>
No no not yet <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#161:1:A>
The agreement uh among the members of the Impeachment Court is immediately after the cross-examination <&> The majority leader speaks </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#162:1:A>
You will allow re-direct okay re-direct first
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#164:1:A>
So <.> Attor </.> so Prosecutor Libarios is recognized for some re-direct questions

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#165:1:D>
In this particular thank you Your Honor in this particular case uh Ms Witness regarding the incorporation of uh the Pio Holding and the Alexie Holding Corporation there was no client who appeared before you and it was only Atty Serapio who requested for these two corporations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#167:1:D>
Am I correct

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#168:1:F>
Improper for re-direct Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#169:1:F>
<{> <[> I did not cover that at all </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#170:1:A>
<[> Improper for re-direct </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#171:1:A>
The objection is sustained

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#172:1:D>
Your Honor please uh there was a statement in the cross-examination which tried to create the impression that uh everything was regular in this particular case

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#173:1:A>
That was the answer given by <{> <[> the witness </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#174:1:D>
<[> But uh </[> </{> in this particular case Your Honor what we are trying to elicit that no principal actually revealed himself to the witness except Atty Serapio who at that time was already working in Malaca&ntilde;ang
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#175:1:D>
So we believe Your Honor this particular line of question would somehow clarify that particular point that was raised during the cross-examination Your Honor

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#176:1:F>
If Your Honor please uh probably it should be noted that the witness is uh was but an associate or an assistant in that firm and clients do not deal with the <.> assos </.> associates or assistants and <{> <[> that was </[> that is why that was not covered by the cross-examination
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#177:1:F>
All that uh was covered by the cross-examination was whether this having uh uh members of the firm sign as incorporators and directors is usual practice

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-069#177:1:D>
<[> Then let the witness </[> </{> 
 
 </I>
