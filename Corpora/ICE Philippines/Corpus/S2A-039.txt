Ms Subido <,> participants in this uh afternoon 's affair at the Management of Financial Institutions good afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#2:1:A>
When uh Mr Anderson went to my office to invite me to be your guest speaker this afternoon I immediately accepted the invitation notwithstanding the very tight official schedule that I have <,> because we always look at this opportunity to clarify whatever misconceptions people have about the Bureau of Customs <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#3:1:A>
Your written invitation requested me to say or to speak on the subject of the role of the Bureau of Customs towards nation building
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#4:1:A>
I don't know really if this is the real intent because if this is the one it will be much easier for me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#5:1:A>
But maybe many of you here who are in one way or another has something to do with the Bureau of Customs either you personally or your parents or your friends who 'd like to know about the Bureau of Customs <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#6:1:A>
I think all of you are students of Economics and uh our economics textbooks tell us that the primary purpose of the Bureau of Customs is to facilitate trade <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#7:1:A>
So that the revenue-generating function of the Bureau of Customs is only secondary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#8:1:A>
However in a developing country like the Philippines wherein the sources of revenues of the government is not enough <,> to meet all the financial obligations of the government <,> the Bureau of Customs is considered as a major revenue-generating agency <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#9:1:A>
The Bureau of Customs is second only to the Bureau of Internal Revenue in revenue generation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#10:1:A>
For this year the original target given to the Bureau of Customs to collect is eighty-five point one billion pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#11:1:A>
That is thirty-five percent of the expected revenue of the government <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#12:1:A>
If you will compare this with developed countries <,> percentage wise what is being expected from the Bureau of Customs is too much
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#13:1:A>
If you take for instance Japan or the United States their customs services only collects about three percent of the national revenue of those countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#14:1:A>
You can see therefore that the Bureau of Customs is heavily burdened by our government to collect revenues <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#15:1:A>
The expected revenue for this year was eighty-one eighty-five point one billion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#16:1:A>
But the computations of this expected revenue were based on several assumptions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#17:1:A>
First the assumption is the volume and value of imports which was estimated to be thirteen billion dollars <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#18:1:A>
It 's also assumed that sixty-five percent of non-oil imports will be subject to tax and duties and thirty-five percent are exempted from the payment of duties and taxes <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#19:1:A>
It was also assumed that the oil-import <,> ninety-five percent will be tax-exempt will be subject to tax and five percent will be exempt from tax
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#20:1:A>
Another assumption was <,> the nine percent levy I think all of you have already heard of this nine percent levy will be applied for the entire year of nineteen ninety-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#21:1:A>
And that the dollar exchange will be twenty-eight pesos and fifty centavos to a dollar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#22:1:A>
These were the major assumptions in the computation of our target
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#23:1:A>
However there are economic developments not only in the Philippines but in other parts of the world that affected our economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#24:1:A>
For instance the Gulf War
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#25:1:A>
Another is the national calamities that happened in our country <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#26:1:A>
So that sometime in July the target for the Bureau of Customs was recomputed and it was lowered to seventy-eight point five billion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#27:1:A>
However as of last month September <,> our planning institutions particularly the NEDA have come up that the most reasonable target for the Bureau of Customs this year is sixty-four point eight billion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#28:1:A>
If this latest assessment will be followed we in the Bureau of Customs <,> are very confident that we are going to meet our target
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#29:1:A>
As of now we just have to collect sixteen billion up to the end of the year to meet the target
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#30:1:A>
And the rate of import is very encouraging
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#31:1:A>
Administration of the Bureau of Customs is not simply collection of duties and taxes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#32:1:A>
If you are really interested on the role of the Bureau of Customs on nation-building <,> in addition to the revenues that the Bureau of Customs collect for the government we have to consider the many services that we provide to importers and exporters
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#33:1:A>
You can see that there is a continuous growth of importation in this country even if we remove the effect of inflation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#35:1:A>
In other words if we consider the real value there is a definite increase in the amount of imports in this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#36:1:A>
The same thing can be said about our exports
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#37:1:A>
The same thing can be said about investments of foreign businessmen into the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#38:1:A>
We can say that in the growth of import growth of imports export and growth of investment the Bureau of Customs contribute in the proper administration of all their activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#39:1:A>
Let me start from the pricing of imports
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#40:1:A>
When I first joined the Bureau of Customs in nineteen eighty-seven our processing procedures required forty-two signatures before an importation can be released from the Bureau of Customs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#41:1:A>
And sometimes it will take up to a month or more before an import can be released
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#42:1:A>
So the very first thing I did was to examine our import procedures
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#43:1:A>
And with the help of my staff we were able to reduce the number of signatures from forty-two to seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#44:1:A>
And the number of stations from fifteen to seven to <,> four <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#45:1:A>
So we really expedited the processing of import documents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#46:1:A>
I ordered that unless there is something wrong in the importation <,> they should be released within seventy-two hours upon unloading in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#47:1:A>
This system that I have initiated we call it the non-stop processing in the release of shipments
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#48:1:A>
As we progressed we further improved our uh processing procedure
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#49:1:A>
We came up with what we call express processing in the release of shipment wherein theoretically <,> import documents can be processed even before the arrival of the goods
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#50:1:A>
So that when the goods arrive in the pier they can be transferred from the ship to your truck <,> to your warehouse
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#51:1:A>
So it is possible that a shipment can be released from the Bureau of Customs within hours upon arrival into the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#52:1:A>
This is our biggest contribution to the importing industry by facilitating the release of their shipment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#53:1:A>
We have several procedure in the handling of exports
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#54:1:A>
We have also <.> sy </.> <.> sys </.> systematized the procedure so that exportation would be very easy for our exporters
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#55:1:A>
The second line of services that we provide is in the storage of raw materials
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#56:1:A>
In other words the Bureau of Customs supervises the warehouses that our importers and exporters operates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#57:1:A>
In the Metro Manila area alone we have more than eight hundred warehouses warehouses of all kinds manufacturing miscellaneous public and private and garment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#58:1:A>
It is the Bureau of Customs that supervises the operation of these warehouses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#59:1:A>
Before I came to the Bureau of Customs for every warehouse there is assigned a warehouseman a storekeeper that will account for the raw materials that they 're importing and they are exporting
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#60:1:A>
In view of the numerous complaints of warehouse operators of abuses committed by customs personnel and with the advent advent of computers we have adopted the what we call <mention> open banded system </mention> wherein the monitoring of imported materials is done through computers by account officers in our central office
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#61:1:A>
This procedure dispensed the services of a warehouseman and a storekeeper
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#62:1:A>
You can see that in almost everything that we do in the Bureau of Customs is to support our importers and exporters who after all are the prime movers of our economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#63:1:A>
We cannot point out a single project that supports economic development but we can say that in almost all economic activities in this country the Bureau of Customs has some participation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#64:1:A>
So as you can see <,> the Bureau of Customs is one of the most essential element or agency of the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#65:1:A>
But sad to say because of the very unfavorable image of the Bureau of Customs in the past and the very unsympathetic attitude of many of our politicians the Bureau of Customs is encountering so much difficulty in performing its mandated function
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#66:1:A>
For instance the Bureau of Customs last year collected forty-eight billion pesos but our appropriation was a measly amount of three hundred eighty-eight million
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#67:1:A>
There is not a single centavo appropriated for equipment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#68:1:A>
Maybe some of you have gone to the Bureau of Customs and you saw for yourself the very pitiful and miserable working condition of the Bureau of Customs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#70:1:A>
For example in the Manila International Container Port a port that collects about hundred ten million pesos a day is housed in a former warehouse
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#71:1:A>
I mention this because <,> while so much is expected from the Bureau of Customs very little is given
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#72:1:A>
I think uh Mr. Anderson can tell you the appearance of the office
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#73:1:A>
It could not maybe even equal the office of a section chief of the G S I S or the Philippine National Bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#74:1:A>
But that is the attitude of our people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#75:1:A>
They feel that because the Bureau of Customs is collecting so much money everybody in that agency has plenty of money and the agency as a whole is supported with the proper amount of money in its appropriation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#77:1:A>
The Bureau of Customs is facing so much problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#78:1:A>
I have already mentioned to you the financial support <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#79:1:A>
The second is public apathy and the corrupting influence of our society
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#80:1:A>
I say <mention> public apathy </mention> because <,> many of our people know a lot of illegal activities of our importers and exporters
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#81:1:A>
But they would rather remain silent because they don't want to be involved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#82:1:A>
Or if they do they make anonymous letters to the newspapers or radio announcers accusing personnels of the Bureau of Customs or the agency as a whole for graft and corruption
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#83:1:A>
And yet they would not like to come forward to be identified <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#84:1:A>
Our newspapers are only very good in printing articles or stories derogatory or against the Bureau of Customs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#85:1:A>
They have never taken pains to study and understand the many reforms that we have instituted in the Bureau of Customs to make it an agency useful to the economy and more responsive to the needs of the people dealing in the Bureau of Customs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#86:1:A>
That 's why sometimes when I open containers involving irregular shipment I would rather not invite the press or the radio and television people because many people have already developed the impression that the main purpose of the Bureau of Customs is to catch smugglers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#87:1:A>
If ever we are doing that it is only incidental
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#88:1:A>
We catch smugglers to protect our local manufacturers who are being prejudiced by the items that they are smuggling and to protect the interests of the government so that we can collect the proper amount of duties and taxes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#90:1:A>
There are many other areas of the Bureau of Customs which I can discuss with you but as I told Mr Anderson I think it would do us better if I 'll just give an overview and you ask questions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#91:1:A>
Because by so doing I 'm sure that I will be addressing the issue that you are interested to know <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#> Like for example I don't know how many of you here would like to learn more about our anti-smuggling campaign
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#92:1:A>
How many of you here would like to know what are the measures that I 've taken to fight graft and corruption in the Bureau of Customs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#93:1:A>
How many of you here uh are interested to know what are the things I have done to help importers and exporters
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#94:1:A>
And what are the measures I have done to improve collection efficiency in the Bureau of Customs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#95:1:A>
And I said the topic which you wanted me to talk about is the role of the Bureau of Customs in nation-building
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#96:1:A>
And I can simply state that our contribution in nation-building is by facilitating trade so that our importers and exporters can conduct their activities in such a way that will promote growth and stability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#97:1:A>
So I leave you at that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-039#98:1:A>
I am prepared to answer any question about the Bureau of Customs <O> clapping </O>
