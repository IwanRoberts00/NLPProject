<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#1:1:A>
This is the fifty-fifth edition of the U A A P and we 're coming to you live from the Araneta Coliseum where we 're going to have thunder and lightning all day long
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#2:1:A>
On that note I 'd like to uh welcome all the basketball-loving fans all over the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#3:1:A>
I 'm Joaqui Trillo and with me is uh a new face
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#4:1:A>
Okay he 's the better looking of the Javiers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#5:1:A>
Jimmy Javier
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#6:1:A>
Jimmy uh welcome to the U A A P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#7:1:A>
I know this is your first time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#8:1:A>
By the way our senior sportscaster Dick Ildefonso is leaving uh for Barcelona
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#9:1:A>
He 's going to cover the games and he won't be here for about two months because he 's got to buy all our <indig> pasalubongs </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#10:1:A>
Okay so Dick have fun
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#11:1:A>
I know you 're leaving tomorrow but uh we 'll see you in about two <w> months' </w> time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#12:1:A>
Anyway Jimmy welcome to the U A A P

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#13:1:B>
Good afternoon Joaqui Trillo and uh it 's uh I 'm sure I 'm going to have a very fun time here doing the games with you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#14:1:B>
We 'll have two games on tap this afternoon <{> <[> we 'll have </[> U P - U S T and Adamson versus Ateneo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#15:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#16:1:B>
But <{> <[> first </[> <.> be </.> before we started this telecast we we already started the opening ceremonies for this uh fifty-fifth edition of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#17:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#18:1:A>
I know Jimmy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#19:1:A>
And you know it was so exciting during the parade of teams and the dance numbers and all that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#20:1:A>
We could see boy this Coliseum of about twenty-five thousand people about to explode huh and you know a lot of controversy so far but they say that they 're gonna settle that on court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#21:1:A>
I think that 's nice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#22:1:B>
They will settle that on court and uh a brief talk with uh Anton Montinola who heads <{> [> uh </[> F E U said that it 's another year it 's a different ballgame as you said they will settle it with the ball inside the court

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#23:1:A>
<[> Uh uh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#25:1:A>
Okay we 'd like to say uh while while we 're waiting for that ceremonial uh the <,> toss of the first ball by uh Quezon City Mel Mathay by the way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#26:1:A>
We 'd like to tell you that U S T out of all I think has to be favored uh Jimmy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#27:1:A>
They 've got an intact line-up from last year and a lot of their players were playing in the Philippine Amateur Basketball League
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#28:1:A>
So a lot of experience there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#29:1:A>
And then you 've got that triple tower threat
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#30:1:A>
That 's uh Adamson they 've got Feihl standing seven feet
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#31:1:A>
They 've got uh <{> <[> <.> Pine </.> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#32:1:B>
<[> Marlou </[> </{> Aquino

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#33:1:A>
Marlou Aquino six nine Pineda six six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#34:1:A>
Then of course you 've got the most dominant basketball player in the league right now Zandro Limpot for La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#35:1:A>
You 've got uh the peppery Johnny Abarrientos from uh F E U
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#36:1:A>
There 's no more problem but Johnny Abarrientos is there and this all is a force to reckon he can make things happen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#37:1:A>
And then your <foreign> alma mater </foreign> Ateneo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#38:1:A>
Okay it 's a fighting squad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#39:1:A>
I talked to Chot Reyes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#40:1:A>
Well maybe they might pull some surprises just like U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#41:1:A>
And a first again in the U A A P we have and I think in uh amateur basketball sport will be the first lady manager and that 's Tess Jasmines of U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#42:1:A>
She 's gonna sit in on the bench of U P Jim
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#43:1:A>
And just to round up things we 've got U E a new coach
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#44:1:A>
That 's uh Johnny Revilla and then also N U the favorite whipping boys but don't bet your money uh your life on it this time uh Jim

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#45:1:B>
<{> <[> Here 's the game </[> or two to win <unclear> words </unclear> this year

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#46:1:A>
<[> I know </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#48:1:A>
As they did last year they won one game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#49:1:A>
So maybe this year they 'll win by three or four and uh okay we 'll we 'll go to studios first Jim and then we 'll come back for the ceremonial uh toss of uh by Mayor Mel Mathay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#50:1:B>
Yes uh the U double A P has uh chosen Quezon City as its venue for most of the ballgames the basketball games
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#51:1:B>
It 's just fitting that uh new newly-elected Mayor uh Mel Mathay will be doing the ceremonial toss right here in Araneta Coliseum

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#52:1:A>
Right newly-elected Mayor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#53:1:A>
So uh uh <,> that 's uh they 're introducing the players right now from both teams that 's uh U P and U S T but soon we will be uh having that ceremonial toss <&> emcee introduces players </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#55:1:A>
Emcee now in today 's proceedings is uh Web de los Reyes Sports Radio <&> utterance of the emcee </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#56:1:A>
Hey how do you feel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#57:1:A>
How does it feel to be here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#58:1:B>
It appears <unclear> words </unclear> but it 's fun Joaqui because uh it 's the first time I 've been to a U double A P game since college and that 's like uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#59:1:A>
Wow that 's twenty years ago

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#60:1:B>
Let 's not let 's not say how many years ago
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#61:1:B>
That 's

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#62:1:A>
Twenty years ago it seems that 's a long time

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#63:1:B>
Very jam-packed Araneta Coliseum Joaqui
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#64:1:B>
I was surprised to see all these <{> <[> people </[> supporting their teams

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#65:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#66:1:A>
And you 'll be surprised every game it 's like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#67:1:A>
The students the fans they all come out and support the teams
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#68:1:A>
You know there 's nothing like uh college ball okay <O> noise </O> the universities and all all schools right now are very competitive and that 's the reason why I think we have a very good turn-out Jim

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#69:1:B>
And we can barely see that the uh alumni of La Salle have uh come in great numbers with uh <quote> eighty seventy-seven we keep score </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#70:1:B>
They have <quote> the glory years </quote> and of course well we 'll be talking more about uh a little controversy that occurred last year but as we talked to the concerned parties a little earlier it 's past them now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#71:1:B>
It 's a new uh it 's a new school year and it 's a new ball game for those two teams that went to that championship last year

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#72:1:A>
Yes <unclear> words </unclear> Jim I think Adamson and U S T will be in the thick of the fight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#73:1:A>
I really believe so
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#74:1:A>
Adamson they 've got height and U S T a lot of experience there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#75:1:A>
Yeah you 're saying you 're pointing out those streamers at the La Salle section <quote> eighty to seventy-seven we keep score </quote> and then <quote> the glory years nineteen eighty-nine nineteen ninety nineteen ninety-one </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#76:1:A>
Okay let 's let 's turn you over now uh to Web de los Reyes and uh we will have that ceremonial toss now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#77:1:A>
But they 're they 're introducing members of both squads but that 's taking some time now <O> noise </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#78:1:B>
Well uh very familiar faces in uh the U S T team we see Dennis Espino there is Udoy Belmonte

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#79:1:A>
Right you should know because they played in the League
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#80:1:A>
You you covered some of those games <&> opening ceremony </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#81:1:A>
We 're here now with uh the Mayor of Quezon City of course newly-elected Mayor Mel Mathay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#82:1:A>
Congratulations uh Mayor

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#83:1:C>
Thank you Joaqui and uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#84:1:A>
Jimmy

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#85:1:C>
Jimmy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#86:1:A>
Yes now that you 're the new mayor uh the new mayor of Quezon City what uh programs do you have to develop sports in uh Quezon City <,> Mayor

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#87:1:C>
Well uh definitely it was one of the highest priority in uh the city 's program
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#88:1:C>
In fact uh when I uh address the City Council for the State of the City it would be one of the programs that will be part of the address
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#89:1:C>
We 're trying to uh consolidate and recover uh the uh Amoranto Stadium precisely so we could utilize this in a more uh vigorous and aggressive sports program
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#90:1:C>
You know in the public schools alone in Quezon City elementary and high school we have a population of quarter of a million two hundred <{> <[> fifty </[> million <&> should be thousand </&> student population

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#91:1:A>
<[> Wow </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#92:1:C>
And considering that uh one of our uh principal uh concern is the drug problem you know sports will have to play our key role <{> <[> <,> </[> in uh addressing this problem of uh drug addiction

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#94:1:A>
<[> Key role </[> </{> yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#96:1:A>
I share that view really that drug addiction problem I mean through sports I think I think you 'll be able to do that

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#97:1:C>
That 's the reason why uh the theme of the U A A P this year I think is very appropriate meaning uh character <?> exerted </?> the character promotes sport and help the nation and of course help the host city Quezon City

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#98:1:A>
Hey we 'll be playing a lot of almost all our games in Quezon City Loyola Center and uh Araneta
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#99:1:A>
I think a few games some other place but most of the games will be held in Quezon City

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#100:1:C>
Yes that 's what I was told uh by the President of U A A P and I assured him that I have given orders to the Central Police District that uh to guarantee and ensure that these two venues would be uh safe not only for the those who would be attending the games but uh to see to it that uh there will be no carnapping

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#101:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> Okay that 's really nice to hear from the Mayor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#102:1:A>
Hey that 's really very nice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#103:1:A>
Now tell me is there a favorite team you 're rooting for or no

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#104:1:C>
Well not really
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#105:1:C>
I uh come of course from the uh State University

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#106:1:A>
I know

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#107:1:C>
But uh you know uh this is one area where we would really like uh all the teams to do their best
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#108:1:C>
After all uh it has been a truism that it is not in winning but it 's how you play the game

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#109:1:A>
How you play the game
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#110:1:A>
Very true and besides the Mayor couldn't say <mention> for U P </mention> because there 's an Atenean there and a La Sallite here so <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#111:1:A>
So Mayor is there any parting words you 'd like to
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#112:1:A>
Uh Jimmy would you like to ask uh anything

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#113:1:B>
Well uh it 's a little political but I 'm sure it was a very gratifying win for uh former Congressman now Mayor-elect of Quezon City uh Mel Mathay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#114:1:B>
And uh I 'm sure uh there will be a wealth of experience from the Metro Manila Authority and uh his stint as congressman as he goes into his new position of mayor of Quezon City

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#115:1:C>
Thank you uh Jimmy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#116:1:C>
You know it has been a twenty-five year quest having been elected vice-mayor of the city twenty-five years ago having served Metro Manila as vice-governor and also elected to the <indig> Batasang Pambansa </indig> and uh before elected to the mayorship as uh member of the uh Congress of the Republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#117:1:C>
So I think uh hopefully with everybody supporting us we will be able to approximate and reach the vision of uh the late President Quezon of what Quezon City ought to be

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#118:1:B>
And on that hopeful note we thank uh Mayor Mel Mathay for gracing the occasion and I 'm sure you 'll be here with us in the coming games to watch <{> <[> the rest </[> of the of the U double A P season

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#119:1:C>
<[> Of course </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#121:1:A>
Congratulations

<ICE-PHI:S2A-011#122:1:C>
