Then it 's hard to see each other 'cause so many assignments projects

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#79:1:A>
Conflicting schedules

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#80:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#89:1:A>
I like our schedule <,> college
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#90:1:A>
College is better because like our dismissal time is at two thirty or three thirty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#91:1:A>
Well at Saint Peter <,> we we go home at around five thirty so it 's better
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#92:1:A>
College is better

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#93:1:B>
Ours is four so it 's not much of a difference <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#94:1:B>
But <,> college is okay since <,> we learn to be more independent of ourselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#95:1:B>
In high school you 're still like in the four walls of the school
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#96:1:B>
<{> <[> You don't go </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#97:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#110:1:B>
But <,> mainly <,> you get to meet a lot more people when you 're in college

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#111:1:A>

Huh <,> our batch we were in fourth year then and also like uh <w> Teachers' </w> Day
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#130:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#131:1:A>
Then afterward the Religion Department got angry and made <&> speaker B chuckles </&> us clean up the whole mess <&> speaker B chuckles </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#132:1:A>
And then they 've <,> they <,> suspended us for a day
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#133:1:A>
So we didn't have class for a day which was actually kind of fun <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#135:1:A>
We never <,> regretted it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#136:1:A>
Actually <,> I felt kind of sad 'cause the food <,> went to waste but well it was a fun experience once in a lifetime kind of thing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-033#137:1:B>
Yeah you don't get to food fight I don't know
