<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#3:1>
<bold> SURFING </bold> , also known as <mention> surfboard riding
</mention> , is a popular aquatic activity in many parts of the world where
waves go wild and peak very high.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#4:1>
It is the act of riding on waves as these break over a shallow
shoreline. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#5:1>
<mention> Body surfing </mention> is the simplest form of this
sport where a surfer swims onto a wave and rides it to shore.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#6:1>
Lying, kneeling, or standing on a surfboard are the other known ways
of surfing.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#7:1>
Since the 1960s, the popularity of surfing as a sport and pastime has
grown because it requires no formal training and can be enjoyed virtually
anywhere when waves break.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#8:1>
Nevertheless, if your aim is to eventually compete, you have to train
with the pros at open-ocean coastline surfing sites. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#9:1>
Nobody knows exactly how or where surfing originated.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#10:1>
There must be a grain of truth in a persistent legend that the
aquatic activity was a popular pastime with Hawaiian royalty.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#11:1>
British explorer Capt. James Cook, who sailed into the islands in
1778, was the first European to note its popularity and observe that the
sport seemed recreational than competitive.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#12:1>
He was followed by a band of spoilsports - - some Christian
missionaries - - who proceeded to suppress what they considered a frivolous
activity through much of the 19th century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#13:1>
Surfing in Hawaii was, however, officially revived in 1920, when
a famous Hawaiian swimmer/surfer/actor/politician, Duke Paoa Kahanamoku,
formed the first surfing club in Waikiki although five years earlier, he had
already introduced the sport to Australia.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#14:1>
By the time of his death in 1968, the sport had achieved worldwide
popularity and international surfing competitions were already being held.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#15:1>
In swimming, he won three Olympic gold medals for the United States
and for several years was considered the greatest freestyle swimmer in the
world until Johnny Weissmuller broke his record in 1922.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#16:1>
Intermittently from the mid-1920s, Kahanamoku was a motion-picture
actor and from 1932 to 1961, he was sheriff of the city and county of
Honolulu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#17:1>
Everyone is welcome to try surfing but first, you must learn how
to swim and it is particularly important to be a very strong swimmer.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#18:1>
So take lessons, practice swimming and learn survival techniques.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#19:1>
For starters, you can try joining the fledgling Surfing
Association of the Philippines, a non-stock, non-profit organization
dedicated to propagate and professionalize wave surfing in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#20:1>
It was recently formed by a group of surfing enthusiasts like Manny
Casto, Tarny Perkins, Jacob Uichico and Michael Guzman.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#21:1>
If you have time on your hands for travelling, head for the beaches
of La Union and ask around for the Japanese surfer who provides lessons and
coaching for correct surfing techniques.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#22:1>
We were told it only takes a day to get through the rudiments and by
day 's end, you should be able to stand on a surfboard over the big waves or
your money back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#23:1>
From there, you 're on your own and can proceed to visit the
other surfing sites in the country in Baler, Quezon; Daet, Camarines Sur;
Baras, Catanduanes; Borongan, Samar; and Siargao, Surigao del Norte.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#24:1>
Still, never surf alone and check if the beaches are patrolled. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#25:1>
The most important piece of the equipment for surfing is a
surfboard.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#26:1>
Designs vary according to your specific needs and the conditions of
the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#27:1>
Beginners are advised to start with a wide stable board, as they will
find it easier to control.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#28:1>
Modern surfboards are made of a plastic foam core that is shaped by
hand or machine and then covered with a shell of fiberglass and resin.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#29:1>
The high-performance surfboards used by top professional competitors
are known as shortboards.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#30:1>
On the other end of the surfboard spectrum are the longboards that
are about the same thickness as shortboards.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#31:1>
The bottom of a board has from one to five fins near the tail,
although the three-fin, or thruster, design is standard.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#32:1>
These fins provide the board with directional stability and enhance
performance by providing additional power and forward drive.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#33:1>
While either board can be used in professional or recreational
contests, the shortboard is better for speed and aerial maneuvers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#34:1>
A wetsuit is also necessary in most climates as the surfer spends
a lot of time in the wind and water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#35:1>
There are a number of suits locally available in various designs,
brilliant colors, wild patterns and thicknesses of rubber. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#36:1>
For the surfboards and wet wear, there is a one-stop shop
dedicated to the sport at the second level, Building B of the Megamall called
<mention> Quiksilver </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#37:1>
This shop carries an extensive line of surfing gear down to
accessories, except sunblock that is also essential unless you prefer a very
crisp tan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#38:1>
There used to be a line called <mention> Maui </mention> but it
is only sportwear that capitalized on the popularity of the surfing wave.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#39:1>
They 're suitable for cruising the beaches and taking into the water
but they 're likely to rip apart when the big waves come.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#40:1>
<mention> Quiksilver </mention> based in Australia is sturdier and
specifically designed for the sport.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#41:1>
It is based in Australia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#42:1>
Prices start at &peso;12,000 for foam surfboards and &peso;17,000
for the fiberglass coated types.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#43:1>
Wetsuits prices range from &peso;5,000 to &peso;11,000; board shorts
from &peso;850; tees from &peso;900; and booties designed for gripping onto a
surfboard from &peso;1,600 and up.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#44:1>
Check out the other interesting and functional accessories yourselves
like caps, bags, wallets, watches, sunshades and swimwear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#45:1>
The best surfing conditions occur when there is an off-shore wind
forming large and smooth ocean swells in deep water that peak up into steep
sets of waves, or breakers, as they encounter a shelf-like reef or sandbar 90
to 900 meters offshore.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#46:1>
Another type of wave that surfers look out for but more difficult to
ride, is the taller, plunging <mention> &ldquo; dumper, &rdquo; </mention>
which occurs with the steep rise of its bottom to the beach.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#47:1>
The lee side of a point of land or a jetty often has the proper
contour for good rolling break waves.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#48:1>
Under ideal conditions, like in Mahaka, Hawaii, with four-mile waves,
surfers can enjoy half a mile of riding or more. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#49:1>
When the big waves begin to break, the surfer first swims with
his board out beyond their crests to the point where the larger rollers peak
up.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#50:1>
As the wave approaches, the surfer paddles toward shore to attain
sufficient speed to coast down the face of the wave.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#51:1>
Once the surfer, using his board, has caught the wave, he can rise
first to a kneeling and then to a standing position and ride the wave until
it dies out next to the beach.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#52:1>
Long-board riders hold their arms over their heads and shift their
limbs, and thus their body weight, to control their speed and direction.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#53:1>
To increase speed and distance, experts ride diagonally toward shore.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#54:1>
Surfing is presently seeing a lot of action in the Philippines
through the 1998 Action Surfing Cup Series.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#55:1>
The first leg called the <mention> Philippine Centennial Circuit
</mention> was held earlier this year in Aurora, Quezon, with surfers from
the region dominating the event owing to the huge population of dedicated
surfers in the area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#56:1>
The big winners were Rommel Postor - - champion ( 1997 1st
runner-up, Daet tournament 1st runner-up and La Union <mention> Quiksilver
</mention> 1st runner-up); Edmund Mendoza - - 1st runner-up ( 1997 <mention>
Quiksilver </mention> champion, Daet Tournament champion and 1st Aurora
Surfing Cup champion); and Gil Alcantara - - 2nd runner-up ( 1997 Aurora
Surfing Cup runner-up).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#57:1>
The second leg of the series will be held sometime August this year
in Catanduanes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#58:1>
World championships, which started since the earlier 1960s, are
the real big scene venues for surfing competitions.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#59:1>
A greater number of these surfing event have been held on both coast
of North America and in Hawaii, South Africa and Australia.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#60:1>
In international competitions, groups of five-men competing surfers
perform in the same area, each making perhaps 10 wave runs during a meet with
each run scoring up to 20 points.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#61:1>
A panel of judges awards points based on takeoff, turns, length of
ride, and difficulty of wave selected. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#62:1>
The selection of a wave and when to end the ride are at the
discretion of the individual surfers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#63:1>
Thirteen points are awarded for a win, 10 for second, eight for
third, seven for fourth, and one point less for the next succeeding places.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#64:1>
Another system of scoring allows one point for a win and upward for
succeeding places. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#65:1>
What are you waiting for?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#66:1>
Forget about jet skiing, which aqua sport is being discouraged for
polluting the environment and compromising the coral beds.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#67:1>
Go out there and surf to be among the first! </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Have a million pesos?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#69:2>
Put up a fitness center </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#70:2>
<bold> By Joel S. Paradeza </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#71:2>
<bold> FILIPINOS </bold> have grown more conscious of their
health over the years which means investing in a gym may be a good idea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#72:2>
But before rushing into business, here are some tips on how to
start your own gym or fitness center. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#73:2>
<h> <bold> Capital </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#74:2>
Putting up a gym is no joke.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#75:2>
You have to spend from &peso;1 million up depending on the size and
type of gym you are to put up.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#76:2>
A fully equipped fitness center will require millions in capital.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#77:2>
The bulk of the expenses goes to the purchase of equipment.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#78:2>
Most of the equipment are imported although there are some locally
made which could cost less.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#79:2>
A treadmill alone costs from &peso;200,000 to &peso;500,000, and
ideally there should be at least more than one of this in a gym. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#80:2>
At <mention> Step in Life </mention> , total expenses ( including
rent for space, water and electricity bills) for a month reaches up to
&peso;100,000.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#81:2>
Earnings are from &peso;30,000 to &peso;50,000 a month, although
there are also lean months like the rainy season and the Christmas holidays.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#82:2>
As with other businesses, setting up a gym requires a permit from
the mayor 's office including health and engineering permits.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#83:2>
A license from the Securities and Exchange Commission is also
required. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#84:2>
<h> <bold> Right locations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#85:2>
For Emilie Vi&ntilde;a owner/instructor of <mention> Step in Life
</mention> studio in Makati, the most important thing to consider in putting
up a gym is finding the right location.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#86:2>
<quote> &ldquo; You may have a really beautiful gym but if you set it
up in the wrong place, it will lose, &rdquo; </quote> remarks Vi&ntilde;a.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#87:2>
It should be accessible and located strategically.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#88:2>
The mall is a good place to set up a gym as well as a building in the
central business districts because one of the biggest markets of fitness
centers are the office workers and executives who work out before or after
office hours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#89:2>
Being near the offices of these people is an advantage. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#90:2>
<h> <bold> Instructors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#91:2>
Most of the fitness centers right now are a combination of gym
and aerobics.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#92:2>
At <mention> Step in Life </mention> , they have about three gym
instructors and eight aerobics instructors.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#93:2>
All instructors are required to attend the Association of Fitness
Professionals regularly.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#94:2>
Also they are updated on the current trends through reading materials
and seminars. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#95:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Instructors are trained before they become a full
pledged one.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#96:2>
They don't have to be a college graduate but their character is
important.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#97:2>
They should be outgoing, patient and most of all, they should love
their work, &rdquo; </quote> says Vi&ntilde;a. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#98:2>
Running a fitness center is not easy.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#99:2>
People expect to see results and the gym should give them results.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#100:2>
It is not just a matter of lifting and exercising. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#101:2>
Before going into this business, one should be knowledgeable of
the intricacies of the business like competition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#102:2>
With the number of gyms operating now in the country, the
competition is becoming stiff.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#103:2>
Many were forced to close down because they were being left behind
by the competition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#104:2>
Still, according to Vi&ntilde;a, the gym business is on the boom
because the market continues to grow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#105:2>
Maybe this is because Filipinos are now starting to realize the
truth in the old adage <quote> &ldquo; Health is Wealth. &rdquo; </quote>

<h> <bold> Is losing weight a losing battle for you? </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#107:3>
<h> <bold> Here are the five greatest mistakes in trying to lose
weight </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#108:3>
<bold> By Dr. Tyrone M. Reyes </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#109:3>
Let 's face it: Most diets don't work.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#110:3>
If they did, book stores wouldn't be flooded with new diet books
each year.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#111:3>
Pharmaceutical companies will not continue to spend millions of
dollars in research for an effective diet pill.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#112:3>
And investors will stop building slimming salons and weight
reduction centers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#113:3>
Indeed, statistics show that many people fail in their attempts at
weight reduction and of those who succeed, most will gain their weight within
a few years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#114:3>
Yet sufficient scientific data are now available to explain why
most diets don't work.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#115:3>
We know that most dietary failures are not due solely to lack of
self-control on the part of dieters, or to psychological problems, but rather
to definite biological factors.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#116:3>
These factors are based on certain internal survival mechanisms that
are often, unfortunately, at odds with our own health goals.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#117:3>
Understanding these factors will help you develop more realistic
goals for losing weight.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#118:3>
You can lose weight successfully and keep it off, by adopting a
sensible eating and exercise plan and staying off the weight-loss
merry-go-round.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-018#119:3>
Here are five pitfalls to watch out for.

</I>
