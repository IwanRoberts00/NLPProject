Dear Goyang,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#2:1>
Advance Happy Birthday! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#3:1>
Don't worry.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#4:1>
I 'm not getting married 'till you get back.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#5:1>
I can't imagine myself full-packed w/ responsibilities towards a
husband and kids.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#6:1>
More so, I might not be able to finish law school.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#7:1>
So, better to sit back and wait for the right time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#8:1>
Anyway, I 'm leaving everything in HIS hands.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#9:1>
As usual, no clear-cut plans for the future. <indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#10:1>
Bahala na. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#11:1>
But of course, I 'm doing also certain preparations.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#12:1>
Especially financially. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#13:1>
Give my best regards to Bernie.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#14:1>
Thank him for the postcard he sent.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#15:1>
Maybe next time he can clip a few dollars w/ it ( heh heh heh). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#16:1>
I 'm afraid I have nothing to tell because I 'm sure Iting always
keep you updated w/ current events.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#17:1>
We still observe the usual activities - - Didi & Art w/ kids would
visit us and spend the whole afternoon w/ Mama talking politics.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#18:1>
Didi celebrated her b-day at Dona Juliana.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#19:1>
She brought ice cream and <foreign> barquillos </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#20:1>
We gave her long life - - <indig> pancit </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#21:1>
From time to time, Joey w/ your cute boys would also spend the day w/
us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#22:1>
If Jerivel is also around, naturally, drinking spree can't be missed.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#23:1>
How 's your diet?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#24:1>
Sexy <indig> na </indig> ?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#25:1>
<indig> Ako naman maintain lang. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#26:1>
But you should see Iting personally.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#27:1>
What a great change in her physical appearance.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#28:1>
She 's ready for this school year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#29:1>
That 's good news. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#30:1>
About the Fulbright.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#31:1>
I want to know or I want to ask suggestion on what field to apply for
study there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#32:1>
What field would best suit my training and school achievements, if
ever I decide to apply. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#33:1>
'Till next.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#34:1>
Take care and do not make so much <indig> lagaw </indig> especially
if you do not have company.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#35:1>
Don't be too confident w/ your security. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#36:1>
Just take care of yourself.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#37:1>
Don't worry too much w/ your family here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#38:1>
We are one w/ you. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#39:1>
God bless,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#40:1>
Ece </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#41:2>
Dear <indig> Manang </indig> Yang,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#42:2>
Hi!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#43:2>
Here I am again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#44:2>
Thank you for the perfume.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#45:2>
I sent a letter for you last Jan. 10 but the letter was sent back
maybe because you were not there yet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#46:2>
Anyway, as of now I 'm very much fine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#47:2>
In fact, my check-up last Feb. 2 was fine and we 're going back in
Manila on April.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#48:2>
I 'm 108 pounds now.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#49:2>
Last Nov. I was only 79 pounds.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#50:2>
In just 2 months, imagine, I gained 29 pounds!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#51:2>
Oh no.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#52:2>
But okay <indig> na lang na kesa naman magsiwang ko </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#53:2>
Now, I decided to balance my diet <indig> para indi man ko matam-an
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#54:2>
Actually, I 'm happy 'coz I asked God for it and He gave it to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#55:2>
Now, I 'm very much feel secured with Him in my life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#56:2>
I don't fear anything anymore 'coz for me God is my greatest Doctor
and my most valuable and priceless medicine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#57:2>
I realized, when I think of the past, the Lord saved my life for so
many times already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#58:2>
I was His lost sheep but now I 'm found.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#59:2>
Many things had happened in my life that teaches me to trust in Him
alone for the things that are yet to happen.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#60:2>
I 'm so happy and thankful that He healed me physically and most of
all spiritually.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#61:2>
I know that this time I can live my life into the most that I can but
always with His help and guidance.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#62:2>
I 'll never be lost again 'coz I 'm going to follow His way.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#63:2>
Many wonderful changes and things I 've seen in my life that proves
God 's loving-kindness.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#64:2>
This gives me the desire to do everything that pleases Him and can
make me worthy for everything He has done in my life since from the start.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#65:2>
I regret my old life and I just ask the Lord to help me turn my back
from all my sins and follow His ways.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#66:2>
Only Him can help and save.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#67:2>
W/o Him, I 'm nothing and life will be useless but with Him I have
everything.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#68:2>
I 'm so thankful that He answers my prayers.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#69:2>
I 'm assured that I 'll be living a wonderful life and can finish my
life greatly as long as I will always walk in His ways.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#70:2>
Now, God is my everything.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#71:2>
He is my life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#72:2>
I do ask Him to let His Holy Spirit control my life and fill my
wholeself for in Him I feel assurance.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#73:2>
<indig> Basta </indig> I 'm so thankful to God and I 'm so happy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#74:2>
My soul is rejoicing, I can feel it!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#75:2>
( PALMOLIVE) <&> Palmolive = allusion to an advertisement </&> I
thank Him always for our family 'coz I 'm so lucky to be in our family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#76:2>
God gave me so many blessings, <indig> indi na maisip </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#77:2>
I put everything already in His hands and I know He won't fail nor
forsake me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#78:2>
I 'm always praying for you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#79:2>
Anyway, last Jan. ( last week) we went to Goldenfields together
w/ JM, Jojo, Jamie, Joey, <indig> Nang </indig> Jemima, Degaulle, <indig>

Well, this June hopefully, I decided to continue my studies at
UNO-R.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#83:2>
<indig> Nalainan na ko sa La Salle.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#84:2>
Kadamo arte.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#85:2>
Sa UNO na lang para lapit. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#86:2>
I 'm going to take up commerce.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#87:2>
Maybe I 'll major in accountancy or Buss. <&> =Business Management
</&>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#88:2>
With my own strength and wisdom, I know I 'll never pass the course
but with God 's help wisdom and strength, I can do it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#89:2>
Only to Him I rely for wisdom and strength.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#90:2>
I know He 'll help me through my studies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#91:2>
So, 'til here 'coz it 's getting long. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#92:2>
HAPPY VALENTINES!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#93:2>
I love you. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#94:2>
Love,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#95:2>
Iting </I>


<I>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#96:3>
Dear Gloria,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#97:3>
First, thank you for the cute heart you sent through Joey.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#98:3>
I had been complaining about your silence and so I was reassured that
you haven't forgotten me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#99:3>
Did you receive my card?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#100:3>
I sent it well in advance but Joey said you may have left for
California by the time it got there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#101:3>
Also, he came yesterday with your request for notes on Filipino
sounds.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#102:3>
I 'll check the library tomorrow and/or ask Fatima Elli for some
references.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#103:3>
I don't think this will be too difficult to find. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#104:3>
Anyway, I 'm glad you 're hurrying your thesis so you can come
home before ' 96.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#105:3>
Joey says your boys are getting rowdier by the day.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#106:3>
I sympathize with Mrs. Fuentes Sr.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#107:3>
At least, their <indig> yayas <indig> haven't left. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#108:3>
I don't have any &ldquo; juicy &rdquo; bits from the Faculty
Room.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#109:3>
Mainly because I do get tired of carping and complaining, even if
these come from the others like Virgie G. & Cecille N.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#110:3>
What 's more, Vilma has been very nice to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#111:3>
Just the other day, she confided some news about Rushan, her son:
how glad she was that he had broken off with his gf ( who did not appeal to
her) & how he has a new girl in Angela Hilado, a newscaster & now PAL
stewardess.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#112:3>
I thought it was her way of re-establishing contact with me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#113:3>
So, I 'll just stay neutral and try to keep my mouth shut.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#114:3>
Virgie is in the hospital due to bronchitis & was absent last week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#115:3>
Miling is leaving for Manila to witness the papal visit & will be
absent for a week, I suppose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#116:3>
My Christmas was o.k.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#117:3>
Vinci spent the holidays in Manila to &ldquo; house-sit &rdquo; his
<indig> tita 's </indig> apartment ( the <indig> tita </indig> visited her
sister in Singapore.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#118:3>
We spent the day before Xmas with my nieces & nephews.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#119:3>
The vacation seemed so short.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#120:3>
I finished checking papers & doing the grades 2 days before classes
resumed on the 4th.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#121:3>
This is probably something you don't miss at all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#122:3>
<@> Titing K. </@> is still carrying a torch for <@> Tom Cruz
</@> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#123:3>
( Have I told you about her great love for this widower, 59 yrs.
old?)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#124:3>
But he 's in Manila ironing out problems with his job (
consultancy), so the affair is on hold.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#125:3>
But I can tell you: <@> Titing </@> is in love.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#126:3>
And how! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#127:3>
Serge invited us to his home last Dec. 20.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#128:3>
It was raining and all but we had fun ( <@> Titing </@> , Virgie,
Marilou Sta. Maria).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#129:3>
He brewed us some coffee, cooked some <indig> tocino </indig> & we
brought <indig> ensaymada </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#130:3>
We looked at his albums and played with his baby.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#131:3>
The wife was at the office, of course.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#132:3>
He has this cute and very neat house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#133:3>
It will also be his birthday on the 11th, so we may try to invite
ourselves again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#134:3>
The Coliseum is finished & will be inaugurated on the 18th with
Cory Aquino no less.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#135:3>
The Food Court has been in use since last week of classes last
December ( McDo 's, Tavie 's, Oriental Zing, Race, <foreign> etc. </foreign> )

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#136:3>
With all the choices, I still find myself ordering from good old
RACE.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#137:3>
An improvement is: the food is hot & the waitresses are more
charming. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#138:3>
Impt: Do you know how to log into INTERNET at your school?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#139:3>
Because Vic sent X 'mas greetings via e-mail ( Electronics).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#140:3>
He 's in regular touch w/ Brother Scheiter who in turn gave him the
number of St. Michael 's.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#141:3>
He sent this before the New Year when you were presumably in
California.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#142:3>
So, please check with your school 's system of Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#143:3>
Then, I 'll be able to send a bulletin almost every week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#144:3>
You 're supposed to check into the computer to see if you have any
letters.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#145:3>
This is a service Lasaltech provides for us over here. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#146:3>
Vinci rehearses very night for the Singapore play about the 14
martyred brothers of La Salle-Taft.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#147:3>
Have I told you he wrote the script for this musical?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#148:3>
With music by a former Kundirana, Von de Guzman?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#149:3>
To be directed by Gabby Fernandez.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#150:3>
From the Faculty, they got Marilou Sta. Maria & <@> Bill Bersamin
</@> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#151:3>
Between us, <indig> indi ako believe sa kay <@> Bill </@> </indig>
for this role as he can't really sing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#152:3>
But Gabby chose him.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#153:3>
Pete Delfin, who can really sing, withdrew because he was given such
a minor role.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#154:3>
Anyway, I hope it is still a success because the Singapore alumni
are financing this.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#155:3>
And for the sake of my son who labored over the script. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#156:3>
I 'll write you a shorter letter via e-mail.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#157:3>
And I hope you will send a reply soon enough.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#158:3>
Don't give the excuse of no time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#159:3>
Make time!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#160:3>
Take it easy and do your work!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#161:3>
Regards from the residents of C-12. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#162:3>
Love,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#163:3>

Nov 10, 1996

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#165:4>
Dear Laureen

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#166:4>
Hello!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#167:4>
It was really nice to see you again!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#168:4>
I hope your stay here in the Philippines and the visit to LaSalle
was enjoyable ( if not nostalgic.).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#169:4>
It was really a relief for me that you did answer my letter despite
of the fact that I did not receive it ( it must be return address.).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#170:4>
I thought that you really did not take notice of it and thought that
I was really silly ( sorry I 'm paranoid about this.). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#171:4>
Anyway it is really nice to see that good old Mam Velasco did
not change a bit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#172:4>
So you are back now there, how are you doing?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#173:4>
How about the people there and the education?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#174:4>
I bet you can talk Japanese quite fluently already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#175:4>
How much longer will you be studying in Japan?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#176:4>
After you graduate will you be teaching <foreign> Zen </foreign>
Buddhism in Japan?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#177:4>
( Cool!)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#178:4>
Are those Japanese people easy to get along with?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#179:4>
So, what do you do now for recreation?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#180:4>
( I feel like I 'm doing an autobiography of you.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#181:4>
There is one thing that really makes me curious about your
situation there in Japan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#182:4>
Isn't that your personal philosophy in life is existentialism and
one of the main points of that belief is individualism?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#183:4>
As far as I know Japan is the country of conformity and tradition.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#184:4>
How do you react to that?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#185:4>
Or is the situation there not as bad as I think it is. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#186:4>
You see I 'm also planning to study in Japan like you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#187:4>
After I graduate I will attempt to enter a Japanese university and
study Advertising.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#188:4>
I believe that I 'm a very idealistic, unsuppressed, happy person
and I are really concerned that the Japanese society in general and the
University atmosphere in particular might harm my individuality.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#189:4>
I hate drinking, cigarettes, not discussing a point with the
professor and not laughing during funny movies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#190:4>
( The typical Japanese does all of this and society seems to expect
them to.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#191:4>
There is a saying in Japan that goes <quote> &ldquo; The nail that
sticks out must be hammered down. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#192:4>
Well I like to <quote> &ldquo; stick out. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#193:4>
Anyway thanks for taking time for reading this letter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#194:4>
I really hope that you answer back.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#195:4>
My regards to you and your friends there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#196:4>
God bless you man. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#197:4>
SINCERELY YOUR STUDENT,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-002#198:4>
