<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#1:1:A>
Okay so today we will perform qualitative analysis <&> writes
on board </&> of elements <&> writes on board </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#2:1:A>
From the title of the experiment you can already predict what sort
of tests we will carry out for today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#3:1:A>
So basically we would like to check what elements are present in the
given substance in the sample solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#4:1:A>
Okay since we are talking about organic compounds so expect that
these compounds contain the element carbon and of course hydrogen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#5:1:A>
But also remember that organic molecules sometimes <.> con </.> 
contains uh contain nitrogen sometimes oxygen sometimes the halogens okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#6:1:A>
So we would like to check whether they are present or not
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#7:1:A>
So what you will be given is a sample solution containing all those
elements okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#8:1:A>
So you are given a sample solution containing all those <.> e </.> 
elements and then you will test them for the different elements so naturally
you will always get positive results
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#9:1:A>
So for example if you test the substance for nitrogen you can carry
out that particular test observe see what happens in the reaction okay and be
how do you call this uh pay particular attention with regards to the
formation of precipitates whether there is a change in the color of solution
or not whether there are bubbles that form in the reaction and so on and so
forth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#10:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#11:1:A>
So when you test for nitrogen and knowing that your sample solution
contains nitrogen then those are the positive results
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#12:1:A>
Later on you will be given an unknown solution and that unknown
solution may contain maybe three maybe four maybe five elements we don't know
okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#13:1:A>
So based on your sample solution containing all the elements you
will base the results for the unknown solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#14:1:A>
Is that clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#15:1:A>
So you have a <.> pa </.> sample solution uh containing all those
elements and an unknown you don't know what uh it contains
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#16:1:A>
Now you have read the procedure any question about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#17:1:A>
So we will basically just mix uh chemicals reagents and observe
what happens afterwards
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#18:1:A>
At the end of the experiment I do not expect you to immediately
come up with a chemical equation to explain what happened in the test okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#19:1:A>
You have to do some uh literature search to find out what
particular reaction took place uh in a certain test okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#20:1:A>
So that will be for next meeting but for day for today I will just
ask you to come up with the different observations for each test okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#21:1:A>
Some techniques that you should know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#22:1:A>
If you are asked to test for acidity of the solution for example we
will use a litmus paper for that and you must observe the proper technique in
doing so
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#23:1:A>
You do not put the litmus paper inside the test tube for example
you don't do that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#24:1:A>
What you need to do is to dip the stirring rod in the solution and
touch the litmus paper and see whether there is a color change again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#25:1:A>
If there is a change in the color of the litmus paper from red to
blue for example and that the blue litmus paper remains blue then it means
that you have a basic solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#26:1:A>
If for example your red litmus paper becomes how do you call this
which one okay and then the red remains red then you have an acidic solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#27:1:A>
Okay now if you will look at our solvents and reagents given here
each bottle have its own <.> o </.> has its own dropper okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#28:1:A>
Do not interchange the droppers otherwise some of the reagents will
react with one another and it will be contaminated and uh you will always get
wrong results okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#29:1:A>
So be careful about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#30:1:A>
What else
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#31:1:A>
Be careful with the sodium metal why <,> sodium metal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#32:1:A>
So extra care in handling sodium metal because it reacts violently
with water in other words don't <.> e </.> don't try to touch it because
again your your your hands have moisture and that uh it violently reacts with
it so be careful with the sodium metal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#33:1:A>
Okay any question
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#34:1:A>
Question
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#35:1:A>
Clarification about the procedure
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#36:1:A>

Megamall S M Megamall
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#39:2:A>
Right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#40:2:A>
And here again our guru expert exercise guru <,> Ms Bella

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#41:2:B>
Good morning everyone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#42:2:B>
Welcome back to the show

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#43:2:A>
Uh what are we gonna do today

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#44:2:B>
Today uhm no aerobics

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#45:2:A>
No aerobics today

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#46:2:B>
No
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#47:2:B>
We just get to relax

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#48:2:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#49:2:B>
I teach you how to stretch
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#50:2:B>
They 're yoga techniques
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#51:2:B>
Five thousand year old yoga techniques

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#52:2:A>
Alright

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#53:2:B>
Okay they 're very safe and any practitioner can do this

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#54:2:A>
And by the way Bella just came back from India to she was in
the Yoga Institute for how many months

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#55:2:B>
Uhm <,> five months

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#56:2:A>
Five months of yoga training ladies and gentlemen

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#57:2:B>
Yeah so these are very safe exercises
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#58:2:B>
Uhm <,> yoga <,> some of them are very hard poses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#59:2:B>
But what we 'll do today are very basic poses
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#60:2:B>
We 'll do a forward bend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#61:2:A>
Right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#62:2:B>
A back bend
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#63:2:B>
This is traditional yoga
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#64:2:B>
Forward bend a back bend a side bend and a twisting for the spine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#65:2:B>
Yoga is <,> stretching it 's based on breathing it opens up energy
channels

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#66:2:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#67:2:B>
It 's very very good for relaxation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#68:2:B>
You have to be aware of the breath
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#69:2:B>
The whole thing is uh <{> <[> breath </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#70:2:A>
<[> Breathing </[> </{> breathing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#71:2:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#72:2:A>
Right right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#73:2:B>
It 's very very important
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#74:2:B>
You see what we do in aerobics is we bring we add stress to the
body to bring it up beneficial stress

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#75:2:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#76:2:B>
Now in yoga what we wanna do is bring the heart rate down and
relax
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#77:2:B>
Open the energy channel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#78:2:B>
De-stress yourself end of the day or the beginning of the day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#79:2:B>
This is excellent

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#80:2:A>
Right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#81:2:B>
Two minutes in between you know during work <unclear> 1 word
 </unclear> very good

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#82:2:A>
Good for people that has a high stress job have high stress
jobs

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#83:2:B>
Yeah yeah like you and me <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#84:2:A>
Yeah very high stress <{> <[> job for me </[> there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#85:2:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#86:2:B>
You know lots of fun
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#87:2:B>
So now let 's start

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#88:2:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#89:2:B>
We 'll start out with the forward bend
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#90:2:B>
You can face me face me face me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#91:2:A>
Uhm here we go

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#92:2:B>
And you at home have a floor mat or blanket this should be
excellent okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#93:2:B>
Now back is straight chest is up shoulders down and back arms to
the side toes are up facing to the ceiling and bring the arms out to the side
inhale up reach up inhale up up up and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#94:2:B>
Reach forward as far as you can just forward and hold on to your
toes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#95:2:B>
If this is as far as you can go you can just stay right here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#96:2:B>
Inhale up and exhale up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#97:2:B>
Now Alvin has some flexibility
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#98:2:B>
Watch this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#99:2:B>
I want you to inhale bring that chest up forward chin is out and
exhale down
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#100:2:B>
Bring your elbows to the floor as far as you can just about to
there that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#101:2:B>
Can you bring it lower
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#102:2:B>
Try it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#103:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#104:2:B>
Good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#105:2:B>
And let your head drop down <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#106:2:B>
I want you to hold this with normal breathing inhale and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#107:2:B>
Relax <,> about five deep breaths and exhale <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#108:2:B>
Focus on the breaths <,> and exhale inhale again and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#109:2:B>
Now reach your arms forward as far as you can beyond your toes and
reach up inhaling all the way up inhaling
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#110:2:B>
Reach up lengthen it that 's fine and exhale down <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#111:2:A>
Wow

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#112:2:B>
Good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#113:2:B>
And relax stay here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#114:2:B>
You may close your eyes Alvin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#115:2:B>
Focus on your breath

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#116:2:A>
I wanna fall asleep

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#117:2:B>
Uh no <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#118:2:B>
Inhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#119:2:B>
Think good thoughts and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#120:2:B>
Slowly open your eyes good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#121:2:B>
Okay that was our forward bend
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#122:2:B>
Now we do a back bend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#123:2:A>
I promise I 'll only think good thoughts <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#124:2:B>
Okay now we go

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#125:2:A>
Left right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#126:2:B>
This is called uhm <,> the knee pose <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#127:2:B>
People who practice <foreign> Zen </foreign> and other Japanese
meditations this is what they do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#128:2:B>
Let 's move forward a bit and go up on to your knees
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#129:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#130:2:B>
Open a little bit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#131:2:B>
Shoulder <unclear> 1 word </unclear> apart just that shoulder
 <unclear> 1 word </unclear> apart
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#132:2:B>
Now beginners what you will do is put your hand right here behind
the lower back yes fingers are facing out okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#133:2:B>
I 'm going to go this way and watch Alvin okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#134:2:B>
Now we just wanna bend down keep a right angle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#135:2:B>
That 's it and back
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#136:2:B>
Put your head forehead drop back and stay <,> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#137:2:B>
Now Alvin also as you notice stay there go ahead
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#138:2:B>
Hold this with normal breathing now if you 're not so flexible
just stay as far as you can <,> no competition here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#139:2:B>
Now Alvin stay there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#140:2:B>
Alvin <O> laughter </O> is very flexible okay action star that he
is
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#141:2:B>
Now he can put his hand right by his that 's it okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#142:2:B>
Stay there focus on your throat
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#143:2:B>
Keep pushing your hip forward
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#144:2:B>
Perfect form right there and you may close your eyes <,> and focus
your breath

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#145:2:A>
Oh I can feel that stretch

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#146:2:B>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#147:2:B>
This is very good for your lower back <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#148:2:B>
It brings energy opens up the channel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#149:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#150:2:B>
Now put your hands back onto your lower back and slowly lift up
 <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#151:2:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#152:2:B>
<unclear> 1 word </unclear> back on the sitting position
slowly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#153:2:B>
Drop the hands to your side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#154:2:B>
That 's it and slowly bring that <,> bring the forehead forward
and rest it on the floor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#155:2:B>
Relax your back
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#156:2:B>
Drop your shoulders <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#157:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#158:2:B>
Follow your breath inhale and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#159:2:B>
Again think good thoughts <,> and slowly lift the head off the
floor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#160:2:B>
Relax and inhale up <,,> and when you reach sitting position
exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#161:2:B>
Open your eyes slowly
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#162:2:B>
Good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#163:2:B>
That was our backward bend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#164:2:A>
Wow

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#165:2:B>
Now we 'll do a side bend

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#166:2:A>
I 'm relaxed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#167:2:B>
<O> laughter </O> Let 's face center right leg out to the
side left leg in okay <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#168:2:B>
Again lengthen that spine chin up inhale up and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#169:2:B>
Reach over towards your toes keep your toes out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#170:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#171:2:B>
Good and hold
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#172:2:B>
Hold on to your toe
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#173:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#174:2:B>
Good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#175:2:B>
Now if you can hold on to your toe this way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#176:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#177:2:B>
Look under your elbow open that chest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#178:2:B>
That 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#179:2:B>
Very good Alvin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#180:2:B>
Now those of you who are not so flexible you may stay just here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#181:2:B>
You wanna stretch that arm out open that chest and breathe
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#182:2:B>
Hold with normal breathing and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#183:2:B>

Bring the left leg out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#192:2:B>
Change leg arms out to the side strength lengthen that spine
inhale and exhale
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#193:2:B>
Reach for the toe and open
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#194:2:B>
Now Alvin hold on to your toe
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#195:2:B>
That 's it look under your elbow open the chest open the chest
under the elbow up into the ceiling and hold
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-052#196:2:B>
