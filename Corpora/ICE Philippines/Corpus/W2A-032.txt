<h> <bold> A Preliminary Study of the Performance of On-Off Control in
a Batch Reactor </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#3:1>
<it> This study aims to verify the performance of ON-OFF control
in an agitated batch reactor and to determine the effect of temperature on
its reaction rate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#4:1>
The reactive system studied is Calcium Hydroxide ( Ca(OH) <sb> 2 </sb> )
with Sulfuric Acid ( H <sb> 2 </sb> SO <sb> 4 </sb> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#5:1>
The temperature of the system is controlled using an ON-OFF mode of
control.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#6:1>
The concentration of the reactants are 0.05M, 0.10M, and 0.20M at
reaction temperature of 40&degree;C, 50&degree;C and 60&degree;C. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#7:1>
The temperature of the system was controlled by the flow of the
hot water entering the jacket of the batch reactor using a solenoid valve.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#8:1>
When the temperature of the reactive system deviates from the desired
temperature, the controller sends a signal to the valve.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#9:1>
Then, the solenoid valve turns ON if the temperature of the reactive
system is lower than the desired temperature and it turns OFF if the
temperature is higher. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#10:1>
The use of computers in control systems can be traced back to the
early fifties, that is the application in missile and aircraft control.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#11:1>
Since mid-fifties, computers have been used in industrial process
control which is marked by the design and implementation of the computer
controlled system of polymerization units <fnr> ( 1) </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#12:1>
Today, chemical engineers have approach studies on reaction
kinetics focusing on the factors affecting the rates of reaction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#13:1>
To attain a more favorable result, the process which a system
undergoes must be controlled.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#14:1>
Processes may be controlled to give uniform and higher quality
products by the application of automatic control.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#15:1>
Also, processes which respond too rapidly to be controlled by human
operator can be controlled automatically.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#16:1>
This results to a better quality of products.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#17:1>
This therefore would increase productivity and lower production cost.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#18:1>
In this study, the temperature of the system is controlled using an
ON-OFF mode of control. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#19:1>
The ON-OFF control mode is frequently used due to its simplicity
and low cost.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#20:1>
It is sometimes called the <mention> &ldquo; Two-Position Control
&rdquo; </mention> or <mention> &ldquo; Bang-bang &rdquo; system </mention>
and as the name implies, the output signal is only two, either zero or 100% (
4).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#21:1>
When the measured variable is above the set point, the output signal
is zero and when the measured variable is below the set point, the output
signal is at its maximum value.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#22:1>
The output signal will serve as an actuator to the valve and the
valve will position either fully open or completely closed. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#23:1>
<h> <bold> OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#24:1>
The main objective of this research project is to study the
performance of ON-OFF control in an agitated batch reactor.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#25:1>
The effect of the temperature on the rate of reaction, which is
Calcium Hydroxide ( Ca(OH) <sb> 2 </sb> ) with Sulfuric Acid ( H <sb> 2 </sb>
SO <sb> 4 </sb> ) , was also determined. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#26:1>
<h> <bold> THEORY </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#27:1>
<h> <bold> SOLENOID VALVE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#28:1>
A solenoid valve is composed of an armature, solenoid coil and a
valve.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#29:1>
In the absence of current through the solenoid coil, there will be no
magnetic field to pull the armature up, so the compression spring will push
the armature down.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#30:1>
The valve stem which is attached to the armature, pushes the valve
plug tight against the valve seat.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#31:1>
When the solenoid coil is energized, a magnetic field is established
which pulls the armature up.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#32:1>
As the armature moves up, it lifts the valve plug off the valve seat
and opens the passageway from inlet to outlet.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#33:1>
Solenoid valves are two-position devices, either ON or OFF.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#34:1>
Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional view of a solenoid valve <fnr> (
12) </fnr> . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#35:1>
<h> <bold> ON-OFF CONTROL </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#36:1>
To maintain the desired temperature of the reaction, the system
was automatically controlled using an ON-OFF mode of control through a
computer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#37:1>
A program written in Turbo C language converts the milli-voltage
signals of the thermocouple to their corresponding temperatures.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#38:1>
The program then compares the temperature with the desired
temperature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#39:1>
If the temperature is less than the desired temperature, it sends
signal to the solenoid valve to turn it ON.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#40:1>
On the other hand, computer turns the valve OFF, when the temperature
is higher than the desired set point. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#41:1>
The characteristics of ON-OFF control mode is shown in Figure 2
wherein the actual temperature tends to oscillate around the set point.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#42:1>
An overshoot occurs in the positive direction and undershoot in the
negative direction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#43:1>
Since the process cannot respond instantly to the change in the valve
position, an overshoot occurs <fnr> ( 12) </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#44:1>
If the temperature rises, the rate of heat input is greater than the
rate of heat loss in the process.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#45:1>
Shutting off the control valve cannot lower the temperature instantly
because there are still heat energy built up in and around the heating
device.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#46:1>
This residual heat energy temporarily continues to raise the
temperature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#47:1>
The same way happens when the temperature decreases.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#48:1>
In general, a quantity controlled by an ON-OFF system has a tendency
to undershoot and overshoot the desired value. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#49:1>
<h> <bold> METHODOLOGY </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#50:1>
<h> <bold> Experimental Set-up </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#51:1>
The experimental set-up is shown in Figure 3.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#52:1>
It is composed of a reactor, a solenoid valve and a heater which are
connected by 1/2 inch galvanized iron pipe.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#53:1>
The design of the reactor is the same as that of the existing
laboratory scale non-isothermal CSTR of Olano, S. ( 1990).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#54:1>
This reactor is equipped with a motor on top where the propeller is
connected to.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#55:1>
The motor is also connected to the variac in order that the rate of
agitation can be controlled.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#56:1>
In between the heater and the control valve, a by-pass is provided to
avoid an overload when the control valve is in its OFF position. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#57:1>
<h> <bold> Experimental Procedure </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#58:1>
Preliminary tests were conducted to determine the concentration
of the reactants and the temperature ranges to be used in the
experimentation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#59:1>
The concentrations were 0.05 M, 0.10 M and 0.20M while the
temperatures were 40&degree; , 50&degree; , and 60&degree;C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#60:1>
The flowrate of hot water was 270m1/sec and the volume of the
reactive system was 1000 ml and these were held constant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#61:1>
The temperature of the reaction was first set to 40&degree; C
using 0.05 M concentration of the reactants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#62:1>
Water entering the jacket of the reaction was controlled by a
solenoid valve.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#63:1>
The reactants were then poured into the reactor at the same time the
temperature of the reactor was 2 to 3 degrees lower than that of the set
temperature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#64:1>
The temperature readings from the computer and fluke thermometer were
recorded at an interval of one minute.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#65:1>
Samples withdrawn were analyzed every two minutes to monitor the rate
of reaction with time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#66:1>
The Adsorption Indicator Method was employed in determining the
rate of reaction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#67:1>
In this method, the sample was filtered to separate the solid Ca(SO)
<sb> 4 </sb> products from the solution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#68:1>
The filtrate was analyzed for amounts of unreacted H <sb> 2 </sb> SO
<sb> 4 </sb> after every two minutes by titrating it with BaCl <sb> 2 </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#69:1>
The volume of the filtrate was recorded before it was transferred to
an Erlenmeyer 's flask which contains 1 ml of distilled water and 1 ml of
methanol.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#70:1>
Two drops of 0.2% of Alizarin Red S indicator was added which turned
the solution yellowish.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#71:1>
This change in color from transparent to yellowish proved the
presence of sulfates, SO <sb> 4 </sb> <sp> - 2 </sp> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#72:1>
Titrating with BaCl <sb> 2 </sb> , the solution would eventually turn
light pink at its end point because of the formation of BaSO <sb> 4 </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#73:1>
Then, the volume of the BaCl <sb> 2 </sb> used was recorded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#74:1>
This procedure was repeated for concentrations of 0.05 M, 0.10 M
and 0.20 M of the reactants at temperature of 40&degree; C, 50&degree; C, and
60&degree; C. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#75:1>
<h> <bold> RESULTS AND ANALYSIS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#76:1>
The temperature readings through the use of the computer were
compared with the temperature readings through the use of a fluke
thermometer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#77:1>
At a set point of 40&degree;C, the comparison of the temperature
readings is shown in Figure 4a and 4b at different concentrations of 0.05 M
and 0.20 M respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#78:1>
The graphs show that there is a slight deviation between every
temperature reading obtained from the computer and the corresponding reading
from the fluke thermometer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#79:1>
This deviation can be attributed to the error caused by noise or
disturbances affecting thermocouple signals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#80:1>
The same behavior was observed when the set point was 50&degree; C as
shown in Figure 5.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#81:1>
Increasing the set point to 60&degree; C showed almost the same trend
as shown in Figure 6.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#82:1>
The oscillation of the temperatures with reference to the desired
temperature clearly depicts the behavior of an ON-OFF control action.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#83:1>
The temperature readings oscillate from as low as 40.2&degree; C to
as high as 41.8&degree; C with a differential gap of about 1.6&degree; C when
the set point was at 40&degree;C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#84:1>
Likewise, a differential gap of about 1.0&degree; C was observed when
the set point was at 50&degree; C and 1.8&degree; C when the set point was at
60&degree;C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#85:1>
The differential gap is common to all control systems using ON-OFF
mode of control.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#86:1>
The same behavior was observed at different concentrations of the
reactants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#87:1>
Mean temperature readings through the use of the computer were
compared with the mean temperature readings through the use of the fluke
thermometer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#88:1>
Two approaches in the computation of mean were used ( i. e.
arithmetic mean and mean-value theorem).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#89:1>
Results of comparison show that mean temperature readings for both
fluke and computer has a relatively small deviation of about 1.0&degree; C as
shown in Table 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#90:1>
The effect of temperature on the rate of reaction expressed in
percentage sulfuric acid converted was determined.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#91:1>
It was observed that when the temperature was increased from
40&degree; C to 60&degree; C, there was also an increase in the percentage
conversion of sulfuric acid from 68% to 87% as shown in Figure 7.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#92:1>
The same trend was observed at different concentrations of the
reactants. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#93:1>
<h> <bold> CONCLUSIONS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#94:1>
ON-OFF mode of control can effectively control to within
reasonably prescribed limits of temperature variations of the system to the
desired temperature.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#95:1>
It is reasonable enough to conclude that temperatures oscillate at
the desired temperature, even though the system has a differential gap of
about 1.0&degree; C to 1.8&degree; C.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#96:1>
It was also found out that the rate of reaction increases with
temperature. </p> </I> <subtext.2>

<h> <bold> Present Level of Technology Utilized in Teaching and
Learning in Philippine IHLs <&> =Institutions of Higher Learning </&> </bold>
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#98:2>
<bold> Zelinna Cynthia Pablo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#99:2>
In the aspect of using Information Technology in teaching and
learning in IHLs, the Philippines is, on the whole, still at its infancy
stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#100:2>
Late in the last decade, a study of the status of technology in
education revealed that <quote> &ldquo; [ gauging on educational software and
hardware, as well as research inputs so far] it would seem we are way below
the technology required for quality education in the context of developed
countries". <X> These observations are testimony to the fact that in so far
as quality education and the new technologies are concerned, very much is to
be done in this direction </X> . &rdquo; </quote> [ SUTA89]

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#101:2>
To date, a number of key educational administrations uphold the same
view. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#102:2>
For purposes of this study, it must be noted that this <mention>
&ldquo; infancy stage &rdquo; </mention> has three implications:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#103:2>
First, due to the relative &ldquo; newness &rdquo; of the call
for technology in education, statistical data remains unavailable, even at a
national level, with respect to the exact level of utilization of technology
in IHLs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#104:2>
For this reason, this paper deals with a focal system that is more
manageable, and for which data is obtainable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#105:2>
For the most part, it focuses primarily on De La Salle University.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#106:2>
Efforts of other institutions are mentioned sporadically. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#107:2>
Second, because of the <mention> &ldquo; infancy &rdquo; stage
</mention> that IHLs are in, non-statistical information exchanges have
revealed that only a small number of IHLs are in a position to incorporate IT
tools into their method of educational delivery. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#108:2>
Third, due to the small number of IHLs ready to carry out
incorporation, most efforts are channeled towards planning, and less on
implementation, for the use of technology in teaching and learning.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#109:2>
Hence, for chapters 4 and 5, the tone of the study will focus more
on <quote> &ldquo; tools which we plan to use" </quote> ; limited discussion
is devoted to <quote> &ldquo; tools already in use." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#110:2>
An overview of the technological scenario in the Philippine
higher learning sector reveals the following:

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#111:2>
- the country currently has a pool of 50,000 IT professionals

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#112:2>
- 50% of colleges and universities offer IT as a degree program, but
there is no data on how many use IT as a tool for educational delivery

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#113:2>
- 60% of the population is IT literate

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#114:2>
- there are an estimated 100,000 Internet users

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#115:2>
- 20 universities have web sites, along with 8 other (
non-university) educational institutions [ CABA97] </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#116:2>
Highlights of its current status on the use of technology in
teaching and learning are as follows:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#117:2>
<h> 1 <it> Unified top management planning for use of technology
in education. </it> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#118:2>
Long Term missions, goals, and objectives have been developed by top
administration, and have been documented ( in the form of the NITP).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#119:2>
Strategic plans have been translated into operational goals (
strategies and action plans). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#120:2>
<h> 2. <it> Fragmented implementation of use of technology in
education </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#121:2>
Implementation efforts in support of the strategic plans mentioned
in ( 1) are taking place on a per-institution basis, not through a
synchronized national effort.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#122:2>
The First National Workshop for IT in Education, an attempt to
synchronize efforts on a national level, was completed only in April of this
year.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#123:2>
Major institutions such as UP, Ateneo, and De La Salle adopt the
national vision of using IT in education, and incorporate global standards in
generating their plans.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#124:2>
However, inter-institutional coordination is minimal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#125:2>
<h> 3. <it> Unavailability of scientific data </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#126:2>
As mentioned earlier, strategic statistical data on the level of
technology use in teaching and learning is not available; the Department of
Science and Technology has recently identified the need for such data, but
efforts for its collection and analysis are still in the planning stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#127:2>
At present, information has been gathered through non-statistical
methods: that is, through interaction and exchange with administrators of
selected institutions, primarily through the First IT-Ed Workshop.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#128:2>
No attempt has yet been made to determine a statistically sound
sample.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#129:2>
<it> Because of this, the prescribed table has not been put into use
</it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#130:2>
<h> 4. <it> Pyramidal distribution of technology use </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#131:2>
Based on available data, the use of technology in teaching and
learning appears to be pyramidal in nature: i.e., it is estimated that a
small number of IHLs ( the top tier of the pyramid) are <it> ready to
incorporate </it> technology into the delivery of education.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#132:2>
A smattering of faculty members may have already attempted to use
the technologies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#133:2>
DLSU is perceived to be one of the institutions which is ready
to incorporate technology into teaching and learning, and it is this scenario
that is explored in depth in this study.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#134:2>
The bulk of IHLs ( the lower tiers), however, still support a
dominantly traditional learning environment.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#135:2>
In fact, one issue that was discussed during the First IT-Ed
Workshop was the inequitable status of various educational institutions;
i.e., was it right to plan for IT in education, given that certain
institutions lacked basic resources such as chalk? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#136:2>
<h> 5. <it> Rake effect of technology use </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#137:2>
IHLs are not progressing towards greater technology used at a
uniform rate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#138:2>
Some are far ahead; the bulk gets left behind.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#139:2>
Technology experts do not advocate a &ldquo; catch-up &rdquo;
strategy for this inequity in technological use and resources among IHLs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#140:2>
In other words, more advanced institutions do not have to constrain
their advancements for the sake of smaller institutions catching up.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#141:2>
Instead, the <mention> &ldquo; rake effect &rdquo; </mention> ( some
segments moving forward, others getting left behind) is taken as a given, and
technology use is expected to permeate from more advanced institutions to the
less advanced ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#142:2>
One avenue for this would be the ESEP program, which allows masteral
students from smaller institutions to fulfill their residency in larger ones,
allowing for transfer of expertise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#143:2>
<h> 6. <it> Inequity of technology use even among feeder schools
</it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#144:2>
The inequity that prevails among IHLs is also felt among the primary
and secondary schools that feed into IHLs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#145:2>
Certain institutions incorporate the use of computers and the
Internet as early as Kindergarten; others do not.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#146:2>
This inequity may result in two possible mismatches for students
upon reaching the IHL level: some students who have significant usage of
technology in learning during their early years may find themselves in an IHL
that has minimal use of it.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-032#147:2>
The reverse may also be true. </p> </I>
