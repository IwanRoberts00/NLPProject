<h> <bold> Sad about RP democracy, but proud to be Filipino </bold>

<it> ( Editor 's note: The author is professor <foreign> emeritus
</foreign> of the University of the Philippines ' Political Science and
Public Administration, president of <indig> Kalayaan </indig> College and
fellow and trustee of Social Weather Stations.) </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#4:1>
WHILE more Filipinos are dissatisfied with the way democracy works
in the country and are not proud of our political system, the great majority
of them are quite proud to be Filipino. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#5:1>
This was the most outstanding finding of a recent University of
the Philippines survey conducted nationwide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#6:1>
It 's an important fact to know and appreciate as we celebrate the
104th anniversary of our declaration of independence from Spain on June 12,
1898, and the 56th anniversary of regaining our independence from the United
States on July 4, 1946. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#7:1>
Another significant finding of the survey is that Filipinos
consider being God-centered, industrious and faithful to service, work or
country as most important traits they identify most with &ldquo; being a good
Filipino citizen. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#8:1>
<mention> The INQUIRER </mention> had earlier published other
findings of the UP national survey conducted by the author for the Center for
Leadership, Citizenship, and Democracy of the state university 's National
College of Public Administration and Governance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#9:1>
The survey taken in November 2001 involved interviews of a
representative sample of 1,200 respondents who are 18 years and older, with a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#10:1>
It asked respondents, <quote> &ldquo; How proud are you to be a
Filipino citizen? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#11:1>
Much pride was evident in the responses nationwide: 57 percent
for <mention> Very Proud </mention> ; 34 percent for <mention> Proud
</mention> ; and only 9 percent for <mention> Not Proud </mention> , and one
percent for <mention> Not at All Proud </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#12:1>
One can derive a summary measure for national pride by adding the
first two positive responses ( <mention> Very Proud </mention> plus <mention>
Proud </mention> ) , then subtracting the sum of the negative responses (
<mention> Not Proud </mention> plus <mention> Not at All Proud </mention> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#13:1>
This would yield a &ldquo; margin of pride &rdquo; or &ldquo; a score
for net pride. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#14:1>
The margins for national pride were rather high: 82 percent in
the entire Philippines and even 91 among Metro Manila respondents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#15:1>
The relatively greater national pride of Metro Manilans, who are
usually better informed and more critical than the nation as a whole, made
the finding more remarkable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#16:1>
In general, national pride was lower though still high in the
rural areas ( 79 percent) than in the urban ( 86 percent).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#17:1>
Net pride in rural Visayas was 74 percent; in urban Mindanao, 71
percent; and in rural Mindanao, 74 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#18:1>
The net pride scores did not differ substantially across income
classes or genders.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#19:1>
Notably, in the age groups, pride was greatest in the two youngest
sets: plus 93 for those aged 18-24 years, and plus 87 for those aged 25-34
years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#20:1>
This is a very hopeful sign, for despite the many problems
Filipinos suffer from and adults complain of, our youths keep high their
faith in their nationhood and citizenship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#21:1>
Contrast this with a study of schoolchildren in Metro Manila
during the later years of the Marcos dictatorship, in which most of them said
that they would rather be foreigners than Filipinos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#22:1>
However, this was reversed following the Edsa Revolution in 1986.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#23:1>
<h> <bold> Most valued traits </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#24:1>
The survey investigated the importance of certain characteristics
that &ldquo; good citizens &rdquo; possess as respondents were presented a
list of traits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#25:1>
They were asked to rate each one as <mention> &ldquo; Very
Important, &rdquo; </mention> <mention> &ldquo; Somewhat Important &rdquo;
</mention> or <mention> &ldquo; Not Important. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#26:1>
The summary indicator would be the margin of importance: percentage
of <mention> Very Important </mention> minus percentage of <mention> Not
Important </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#27:1>
The <mention> Very Important </mention> responses were dominant
across all characteristics, so the margins were positive and large.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#28:1>
We are providing a ranking of these traits by their net importance.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#29:1>
Topping the most important qualities were being God-centered;
industrious; faithful to service, work or country; having convictions; and
being responsible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#30:1>
The following were the margins of importance: God-centered, 91
percent; industrious, 91 percent; faithful to service, work, or country, 88
percent; has convictions, 86 percent; responsible, 86 percent; peaceful and
law-abiding, 85 percent; loving and caring, 84 percent; concerned with the
common good, 83 percent; wants to learn, 83 percent; nationalistic, 81
percent; sociable, 80 percent; free, 80 percent; civic spirited, 76 percent;
assertive, 76 percent; willing to unite with others for a common purpose, 73
percent; thrifty, 72 percent; democratic, 70 percent; competitive, 57
percent; and courageous, 57 percent. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#31:1>
<h> <bold> National identity </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#32:1>
To draw out more perceptions on national identity, the survey
asked the people to agree or disagree with certain test statements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#33:1>
For each item, they were presented a 5-point scale.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#34:1>
They were asked, <quote> &ldquo; Would you say that you ( <mention>
Strongly Agree </mention> ) , ( <mention> Agree </mention> ) , ( <mention>
Maybe Agree or Maybe Disagree </mention> ) , ( <mention> Disagree </mention> )
or ( <mention> Strongly Disagree </mention> ) with the statement... ? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#35:1>
The summary measure here would be the margin of agreement - - the
percentage agreeing with the statement minus the percentage disagreeing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#36:1>
The category <mention> &ldquo; Maybe Agree/ Maybe Disagree &rdquo;
</mention> was the neutral midpoint in the range and would not figure in
calculating the margin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#37:1>
There was strong net agreement, at 81 percent, for the test
statement, <quote> &ldquo; I would rather be a citizen of the Philippines
than of any other country in the world. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#38:1>
This is consistent with the respondents ' expression of much pride in
being Filipino. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#39:1>
Disagreement was dominant for the statement, <quote> &ldquo;
People should support their country even if their country is in the wrong.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#40:1>
The margin of agreement was at negative 27 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#41:1>
That is, more Filipinos do not subscribe to the value of <quote>
&ldquo; my country, right or wrong. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#42:1>
There was strong support for doing much better in English
instruction.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#43:1>
The statement, <quote> &ldquo; Philippine schools should make much
effort to teach English properly &rdquo; </quote> yielded a net agreement
score of 79 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#44:1>
This is in recognition of the deterioration in many people 's
ability to speak and write in English, which is a handicap in cross-cultural
learning and communication. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#45:1>
Another item was <quote> &ldquo; Philippine television stations
should give preference to Filipino films and programs over those that are
foreign. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#46:1>
Agreement was less pronounced, at 45 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#47:1>
But still this reflects the concern that Filipino cultures are being
undermined by foreign, mostly American, domination of the mass media. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#48:1>
<h> <bold> Being Filipino </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#49:1>
What does it really mean to be &ldquo; truly Filipino"?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#50:1>
Field interviewers read aloud the following introduction before
asking their opinion: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#51:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Some people say that the following things are
important for being truly Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#52:1>
Others say they are not important.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#53:1>
How important or unimportant do you think each of the following is?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#54:1>
Would you say that it is: <mention> Very Important </mention> ,
<mention> Fairly Important </mention> , <mention> Not Very Important
</mention> , or <mention> Not At All Important </mention> ? &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#55:1>
The summary margin was the sum of the percentages for <mention>
Very Important </mention> and <mention> Fairly Important </mention> , minus
the sum of the percentages for <mention> Not Very Important </mention> and
<mention> Not at All Important </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#56:1>
As rearranged from highest to less high, the listed
qualifications show the following margins of importance:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#57:1>
- &ldquo; To feel Filipino, &rdquo; 85 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#58:1>
- &ldquo; To respect Philippine political institutions and laws,
&rdquo; 83 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#59:1>
- &ldquo; To have Filipino citizenship, &rdquo; 76 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#60:1>
- &ldquo; To be able to speak Filipino, the national language,
&rdquo; 74 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#61:1>
- &ldquo; To have lived in the Philippines for most of one 's life,
&rdquo; 70 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#62:1>
- &ldquo; To be a Christian, &rdquo; 68 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#63:1>
Hence, people believed that the sense of &ldquo; feeling Filipino
&rdquo; was the strongest qualification to be &ldquo; truly Filipino. &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#64:1>
Nevertheless, they believed that respecting the nation 's
institutions and laws was vital for maintaining one 's Filipino identity.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#65:1>
Filipino citizenship and ability to speak the national language
were also deemed quite important. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#66:1>
Residence abroad and being Christian counted a bit less to be
&ldquo; truly Filipino. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#67:1>
To most respondents, to be &ldquo; truly Filipino &rdquo; is
inclusive of Filipinos who live long abroad and of those who believe in other
religions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#68:1>
<h> <bold> Meaning of Nationalism </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#69:1>
The survey proceeded to explore the meaning of <mention> &ldquo;
nationalism. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#70:1>
Interviewers presented a menu of nine meanings for defining
nationalism.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#71:1>
Respondents could choose as many as five meanings to reflect or
explain their understanding of nationalism.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#72:1>
Here is the ranking of definitions, by percentage:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#73:1>
- Loyalty to and service to the country, 72 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#74:1>
- Being proud of our own history, culture and customs, languages,
literature, music, art, and products, 72 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#75:1>
- Promoting freedom, justice and democracy here in the Philippines,
63 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#76:1>
- Promoting the common good and the welfare of all the people, 62
percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#77:1>
- Patriotism and love of country, 58 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#78:1>
- Asserting our independence, 50 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#79:1>
- Promoting nationhood, national identity, and national unity, 48
percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#80:1>
- Opposing foreign domination of our country, 30 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#81:1>
- Promoting the nation 's goals and national interest, 30 percent.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#82:1>
<h> <bold> Filipino heroes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#83:1>
The survey looked into heroism by asking an open-ended question:
<quote> &ldquo; Who do you think are the Philippine heroes from the past
until the present? &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#84:1>
Then the follow-up question: <quote> &ldquo; Who else? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#85:1>
By far the top-of-the-mind hero from history named was Jose
Rizal, cited by 75 percent of the respondents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#86:1>
Andres Bonifacio was a far second, at 7 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#87:1>
Other heroes from history cited were Apolinario Mabini ( one
percent), Manuel Quezon ( one percent), and Emilio Aguinaldo ( one percent).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#88:1>
The top-of-the-mind heroes cited from more recent years were
Ninoy Aquino ( 3 percent), Ferdinand Marcos ( 2 percent), Ramon Magsaysay (
one percent), Diosdado Macapagal ( one percent), Corazon Aquino ( 0.3
percent), and Joseph Estrada ( 0.26 percent). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#89:1>
But an interesting top-of-the-mind answer was <mention> &ldquo;
OFWs &rdquo; </mention> or overseas Filipino workers, which got 0.55 percent.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#90:1>
Also mentioned as heroes were farmers, parents, teachers, and
those who were at the Edsa Revolution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#91:1>
When asked <quote> &ldquo; Who else? &rdquo; </quote> after the
top-of-the-mind question, some respondents gave their answers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#92:1>
Here are the 12 most prominent names mentioned: Andres Bonifacio, 44
percent; Apolinario Mabini, 19 percent; Emilio Aguinaldo, 14 percent; Jose
Rizal, 12 percent; Ninoy Aquino, 8 percent; Gregorio del Pilar, 6 percent;
Ramon Magsaysay, 5 percent; Melchora Aquino, 4 percent; Lapu-Lapu, 4 percent;
Marcelo del Pilar, 4 percent; Juan Luna, 4 percent; and Manuel Quezon, 3
percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#93:1>
Could it be that most Filipinos think one has to be dead to be
regarded among the nation 's heroes?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#94:1>
Could it be that respondents recall more readily as a hero in recent
times a public figure who had been long in the public limelight? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#95:1>
Some might reason that some Filipinos have a short memory, and a
poor sense of history, or even of right and wrong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#96:1>
Significantly, 24 percent of the respondents did not cite any
hero at all.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#97:1>
Yet some respondents mentioned certain groups of citizens as &ldquo;
heroes. &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#98:1>
<h> <bold> National Anthem </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#99:1>
A basic citizen ritual to show love of, and respect for, one 's
country is the singing of the national anthem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#100:1>
How many Filipinos 18 years and above really take the <indig>
&ldquo; Pambansang Awit &rdquo; </indig> to heart? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#101:1>
The <mention> Ateneo youth survey </mention> reported that only
37 percent of schoolchildren could sing it in full. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#102:1>
Our own interviewers requested the respondents to sing or recite
the national anthem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#103:1>
The following are the lyrics, with the corresponding percentages of
those who actually sang or recited each line. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#104:1>
<indig> <it> Bayang magiliw </it> </indig> , 87 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#105:1>
<indig> <it> Perlas ng silanganan </it> </indig> , 77 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#106:1>
<indig> <it> Alab ng puso </it> </indig> , 68 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#107:1>
<indig> <it> Sa dibdib mo'y buhay </it> </indig> , 64 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#108:1>
<indig> <it> Lupang hinirang </it> </indig> , 54 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#109:1>


<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#110:1>
<indig> <it> Duyan ka ng magiting </it> </indig> , 47 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#111:1>
<indig> <it> Sa manlulupig </it> </indig> , 44 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#112:1>
<indig> <it> Di ka pasisiil </it> </indig> , 43 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#113:1>
<indig> <it> Sa dagat at bundok </it> </indig> , 43 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#114:1>
<indig> <it> Sa simoy at sa langit mong bughaw </it> </indig> , 40
percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#115:1>
<indig> <it> May dilag ang tula at awit sa paglayang minamahal </it>
</indig> , 33 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#116:1>
<indig> <it> Ang kislap ng watawat mo'y tagumpay na nagniningning
</it> </indig> , 27 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#117:1>
<indig> <it> Ang bituin at araw nya kailan pa ma'y di magdidilim
</it> </indig> , 25 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#118:1>
<indig> <it> Lupa ng araw ng luwalhati't pagsinta </it> </indig> ,
25 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#119:1>
<indig> <it> Buhay ay langit sa piling mo </it> </indig> , 23
percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#120:1>
<indig> <it> Aming ligaya na pag may mang-aapi </it> </indig> , 22
percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#121:1>
<indig> <it> Ang mamatay ng dahil sa iyo </it> </indig> , 25
percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#122:1>
For citizens who affirm much pride in being Filipino and
otherwise affirm their national identity, only 25 percent, who are 18 years
or older know the <indig> &ldquo; Pambansang Awit &rdquo; </indig> in full.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#123:1>
We wonder how many more Japanese, Chinese, Indonesians,
Vietnamese, Malaysians, Indians, as well as Americans, French, and British,
know their national anthems in full. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#124:1>
One may explain that many older Filipinos ( above 60) learned
the <mention> &ldquo; Land of the Morning &rdquo; </mention> ( and the
<mention> &ldquo; The Star-Spangled Banner &rdquo; </mention> ) because
<mention> <indig> &ldquo; Bayang Magiliw &rdquo; </indig> </mention> came
into use more after World War II. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#125:1>
It may be added that some Filipinos do not know the national
language that well to learn and remember the <indig> &ldquo; Pambansang Awit.
&rdquo; </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#126:1>
Moreover, in Cebu, certain political leaders have actually
banned its singing, and required instead a Cebuano version of it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#127:1>
Maybe, the national anthem is just too long to remember. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#128:1>
Whatever the reason or excuse, our data require deeper analyses
and interpretation of their implications for Filipino nationhood and
citizenship, as well as leadership. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-019#129:1>
The author will certainly pursue the matter in the full survey
report. </p> </I>
