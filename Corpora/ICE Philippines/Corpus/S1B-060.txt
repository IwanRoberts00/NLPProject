<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#1:1:A>
<&> missing words </&> the uh capability of the U S to recognize the document as a treaty must be in accordance with its procedures review of uh as of Fr Bernas that the only way for the United States to recognize the treaty is to have it ratified by their Senate I understand is subject to question because uh as I said there may be those around this very table who who might uh wish to say that there are other ways by which the President of the United States or the Executive Department may consider a document a treaty

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#3:1:B>
I have just two other questions on this point so that the others can also ask questions uh <.> Mis </.> Madame Chairperson
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#4:1:B>
Uh <,> I would like to call the attention of the <.> Se </.> Secretary to the preamble of the Treaty of Friendship Cooperation and Security so-called and in particular to the paragraph which states that the treaty is valid the treaty is valid under international law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#5:1:B>
That does this refer to the fact that the treaty is valid despite the fact that let 's say it is not going to be concurred in by the U S Senate <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#6:1:B>
And the second question is if the Philippine Senate does get to concur with this bases treaty under this kind of a preamble Mr Secretary uh would that mean that the Senate the Philippine Senate in effect uh is made to accept the interpretation that the Constitution does not require U S Senate concurrence <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#7:1:A>
Uh I 'm I 'm looking at the preamble now uh Senator I 'm looking for that uh portion which you were referring to

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#9:1:B>
Uh it is at the uh last uh paragraph <{> <[> uh the first page </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#10:1:A>
<[> Shall provide a framework </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#11:1:B>
It says <quote> recognizing that this agreement which constitutes a treaty under international law shall provide a framework for their continuing relationship and cooperation </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#12:1:B>
Now uh uh would uh concurrence by the Philippine Senate mean acceptance of the interpretation that uh this would not have to be submitted to the U S Senate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#13:1:A>
Uh <,> I think that uh <.> whi </.> <.> whi </.> while acceptance of that interpretation is an important step the uh the fact uh stands by itself and whether we accept it or not there is in the American jurisdiction a <.> si </.> situation where there are more than one ways of getting a document to be recognized as a treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#15:1:A>
Whether we recognize it or not I think uh uh does not change the situation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#16:1:B>
What I mean uh Mr Secretary is that if this Senate of ours concurs with this treaty does it not in effect adopt the interpretation that uh uh it would not this same treaty that it has concurred in need not be concurred in by the U S Senate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#17:1:A>
What uh this uh the language of this uh preamble says that this agreement constitutes a treaty under international law
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#18:1:A>
It is a requirement of uh of our own Constitution that this must be a treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#19:1:A>
And therefore we 're <.> no </.> doing nothing but confirming the language of our Constitution that we the Republic of the Philippines must look to this document as a treaty

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#20:1:B>
And so in effect uh we are adopting the interpretation that uh you have given that uh this treaty need not be submitted to the U S Senate <{> <[> for its concurrence </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#21:1:A>
<[> Uh Senator </[> </{> the act of ratification or recognition as a treaty uh does not antecede this treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#22:1:A>
It comes after this <.> sa </.> the signing and ratification by the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#23:1:A>
Therefore I do not see that it has any effect at all on that matter

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#24:1:B>
Thank you Madame Chairperson

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#25:1:C>
Uh I see that some of our guests uh have arrived and the Chair proposes that the Senators uh address their questions to Secretary Manglapus uh after which we shall hear our uh panelists uh I understand Vice-President Laurel is arriving at uh eleven o'clock
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#28:1:C>
And after we have heard the panelists uh I believe the Senators can address uh questions to them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#29:1:C>
Uh Mr Secretary I 'd like to ask uh the question which I think has been of uh primary concern uh for the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#30:1:C>
This concerns the nuclear provision and uh this appears in uhm <.> supplement </.> uh the supplementary agreement number two uh article four uh section twelve
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#31:1:C>
The uh Philippine Constitution is quite clear about uh the uh prohibition of uh nuclear weapons on Philippine soil
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#32:1:C>
Uh in your opinion uh uh is this treaty uh <.> inconsistent </.> in consistency in accordance with that provision in our Constitution

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#33:1:A>
Yes uh Madame Chairperson uh indeed uh this uh provision is contained in the current agreement and is merely reproduced in the new treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#34:1:A>
Uh we believe that uh it uh uh conforms squarely with the letter and intent of the Constitutional provision uh on uhm nuclear weapons the Constitutional provision

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#36:1:D>
Madame Chairperson

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#37:1:C>
Uh Senator Laurel

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#38:1:D>
I don't mean to intervene at this early stage but uh I would like to raise a question of procedure
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#40:1:D>
In this uh committee hearing do we understand it that uh our resource persons including of course the Secretary of Foreign Affairs who just uh made uh a statement uh of his position and the position of the Government that he submitted to us the treaty for ratification for concurrence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#41:1:D>
Do I take it that we will allow them to each and everyone of them to state their position to deliver their uh statements and then afterwards do we ask questions

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#42:1:C>
Uh yes this is what I uh just said uhm Senator Laurel since uh Secretary Manglapus was the first uh there were just a few guests when we began and uh as head of the negotiating panel I thought he was a valuable person to uh open our discussions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#43:1:C>
Now we are addressing uh questions to him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#44:1:C>
But in the uh interests of time and we are pressed uh for time I believe it was uh decided in our caucus that uh we invite uh we have uh today uh nine guests who have uh confirmed their attendance and uh as I said after we have uhm addressed our questions to uh Secretary Manglapus it is the suggestion of the Chair that uh we hear our panelists and after which uh we can address our individual questions uh <{> <[> to them </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#46:1:D>
<[> Precisely </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#47:1:D>
Do we understand it Madame Chairperson that uh we will allow every resource person to precisely finish with their statement to deliver their statement and we will at the end ask questions or after every each one of them has finished
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#48:1:D>
Do we have the prerogative and are we at liberty to ask questions <?> immediately </?> after they have finished each one of them

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#49:1:C>
Well I think we have the right uh to ask our panelists some questions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#50:1:C>
But time is of the essence I hope that uh this is appreciated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#52:1:C>
We have uh uh lined up a uh a a list of uh guests not only for today but uh until Friday
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#53:1:C>
And it is the intention of the Chair in accordance with the uh agreement which was reached at our caucus that uh we should uh listen to as many uh members uh invited as possible
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#54:1:C>
Now the uh the panelists are uhm uh submitting also their comments in writing so <?> there 's </?> that chance to do so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#55:1:C>
But if there are other suggestions uh uh which uh you would like to propose uh of course I would like to entertain them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#56:1:C>
But as I said it is uhm uhm important that uhm we hear the panelists then of course to address questions to them

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#57:1:D>
Well uh Madame Chairperson I see it here in this notice of hearing well that today September second will be devoted to the discussion of an overview of the overview uh of the treaty that is been has been submitted to us uh foreign policy and legal issues 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#> I for one would like to focus simply uh specifically today on the legal issues
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#59:1:D>
Now uh we also agreed if I remember right Madame Chairperson in our last uh meeting caucus that we would proceed in this manner 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#> The panel of the Executive Department will uh deliver their piece this sort of broad position on all these issues I take it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#61:1:D>
In other words we are submitting like this they are submitting this treaty for <.> rati </.> concurrence of the Senate because we believe it 's constitutional and legal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#62:1:D>
Then we have then I suppose they should focus on certain provisions or items that will involve the issue of constitutionality and justify constitutionality in the course of their uh exposition
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#63:1:D>
Then it would be known as now this panel in the Senate to ask specific questions sort of after the <unclear> words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#64:1:D>
That would expedite and I would like to state I was informed uh I suggested that procedure of raising first and discussing the constitutional and legal questions because I did not see any logic in discussing other items like compensation criminal jurisdiction <foreign> etcetera </foreign> <&> interruption by television commentator </&> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#65:1:C>
Uh thank you well thank you for your suggestions but I think the uh this was discussed in the uh caucus and I believe the uh Chair uhm is interpreting the uh suggestions of uh my colleagues
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#67:1:C>
I think the I would like to allow Secretary Manglapus to uh finish this question on uh the nuclear provision that is a constitutional uh question
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#68:1:C>
And uh then I suggest that uh we hear all of our guests uh who are here this uh uh afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#69:1:C>
And I don't see how you can just say pro and anti I mean I think we might be uh we might be uh prejudging
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#71:1:C>
And I would like to appeal to my colleagues that in the interests of time uh we proceed as the Chairman has decided
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#72:1:C>
Secretary <{> <[> Manglapus </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#73:1:D>
<[> Well uh uh </[> </{> in that case Madame Chairperson uh uh just for the information of the body here uh 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#> Is there any <unclear> word </unclear> uh one particular person or official in government panel uh that will deliver his paper or his statement on the issue of constitutionality
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#74:1:D>
Because if there is none then what will happen probably is that uh after various statements made uh by the members of the Executive panel the Executive Department we 'll ask probably some questions or similar questions which will take more time

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#75:1:C>
I would like to assure my dear colleague uh Senator Laurel that I have anticipated this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#76:1:C>
As you can see the members of the negotiating panel the technical staff are sitting behind Secretary Manglapus
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#77:1:C>
Uh there is Assistant Secretary De Castro who uh will uh address uh herself uh to the uh uh constitutional issues uh as well as the uh status of the forces uh agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#78:1:C>
Uh there is uh Undersecretary Gaces uh who will be answering questions on the <&> interruption by commentators whose voices override the voice of <$C> and <$E> </&> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#79:1:C>
Well I would like to say that Senator uh Tamano did uh give me a uhm a written statement and I think that uh this should be taken also as an indication of a desire to <{> <[> speak </[> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#80:1:E>
<[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> </{> members of the Senate including this uh to write their uh uh request to be recognized by the Chair
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#81:1:E>
I thought that this is an open public deliberation

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#82:1:C>
Mr President I think that this is uh common practice the Committee meetings that uh we send an indication that uh you would wish to speak either in writing or uh by uhm taking uh the floor Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#83:1:C>
And uh I did uh indicate to Senator <{> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#84:1:E>
<[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> </{> and I preceded the gentleman from Mindanao and I 'm just going to ask one question

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#86:1:C>
The Chair has the power to recognize uh the members of uh the speakers and uh I would like to exercise this prerogative of the Chair
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#87:1:C>
Uh Secretary Manglapus if you could please finish uh answering the uh questions <&> interruption by commentators </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#88:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> that the United States may absorb or resolve uh nuclear weapons in Philippine territory without agreement of the Philippines we believe confirms it conforms to this policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#90:1:A>
And there is the the guiding principle that the application of this ban on nuclear weapons must conform with the national interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#91:1:A>
I think the words are <mention> consistent with the national interest </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#92:1:A>
And we believe it is sufficiently consistent with the national interest that we should say <mention> no nuclear weapons unless agreed upon by the Philippines </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#93:1:A>
Furthermore uh there is a the second part of the provision uh Madame Chairperson regarding the uh exemption of visits and uh passage of ships uh is supported also by the statement made by Commissioner Ascuna uh where he says <quote> as practiced both in Latin America as well as by the South Pacific countries that endorsed the treaty of Ara Tonga passage of ships whether nuclear powered or nuclear arms-bearing is left to the determination of every state on a case to case basis </quote> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#94:1:C>
Uh I suppose the U S uh government will insist on a policy of neither to confirm or deny the presence of uh nuclear weapons
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#95:1:C>
What then is our reply

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#96:1:A>
The policy that neither confirms or denies is a universal policy practiced by the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#97:1:A>
Uh we 're told that they are they have they 're forced to practice it so does not to so as not to reveal uh the uh location of their weaponry to a potential uh enemy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#98:1:A>
Uhm it is not uh something that is applied only uh to their relations with the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#99:1:A>
But uh we uh we have the option if we are asked for permission that uh we refuse that permission for storage or installation 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#94:1:C>
But we don't have the capability uh to verify the existence of uh nuclear weapons <{> <[> so what </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#96:1:A>
<[> We are developing </[> </{> that capability
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#> Our Department of National Defense tells us that the capability full capability has not been reached but that in the modernization program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines we shall achieve that capability

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-060#94:1:C>
Thank you

 </I>
