 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#1:1:A>
What we should do this morning is to just recap what we had
discussed last meeting uhm <,> arrive at some form of synthesis as to the the
interests the leading interests of adolescents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#2:1:A>
So probably what I can do is add more to what we have shared
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#3:1:A>
We had an interesting sharing last meeting about concerns and
interests of adolescents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#4:1:A>
Uhm and I think predominant in our sharing last time was uhm <,> 
what was it uhm boy-girl relationships
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#5:1:A>
That particular area has been shared with <,> I mean shared about
extensively as well as parental overprotectiveness as far as that area is
concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#6:1:A>
Now it leads me to another interest another leading interest of
adolescents which is self-direction and in that area okay in that area we
have expressed some of our major concerns
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#7:1:A>
For example uhm let me just go through uhm some of the uhm
expressions of uh assertiveness of adolescents and uh I think uh one of the
ways by which we one of the forms by which we express that assertion is our
demand that we have privacy as far as males our males are concerned our
private properties <O> laughter </O> are concerned our desire to be allowed
to use the telephone and no extension no extension lines being opened when we
are on the phone
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#8:1:A>
Okay we we assert this and this is part of our desire to be I mean
desire for self regulation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#9:1:A>
Okay so if this is not respected by parents it can become an area of
dispute a source of dispute alright
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#10:1:A>
One other way by which I think this was shared last time one other
area by which we <.> ex </.> we express our assertiveness is in the choice of
our <,> activities okay choice of our activities choice of companions choice
of course vocation okay uh where we would like to go to school education
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#11:1:A>
And again if this is if this is uh <,> not respected by parents or
if parents encroach on this it becomes a source of an area of irritant as far
as uh parent-child relationships are concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#12:1:A>
This was mentioned last time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#13:1:A>
Okay uh another area which I think you also experience but which
was not shared at all last time is the freedom to use your allowance the way
you want
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#14:1:A>
Okay is that still uh is that still uh what looked into by your
parents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#15:1:A>
Do they do they investigate how you use your allowance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#16:1:A>
At least that much I think many of you experience freedom greater
freedom to spend your allowance the way you want to
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#17:1:A>
Alright the wish for your own room okay <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#18:1:A>
And then the desire to lock it when you want to and open it when
you want to <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#19:1:A>
Yes Rachel <&> long question but microphone didn't catch it, about
sharing a room with a sibling </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#20:1:A>
Okay so you 're saying that that 's a good a good way by which
you can establish or foster better relationships with siblings <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#21:1:A>
And uh well uh of course not sharing it with parents and I think
that 's a uh sharing your room with parents at the adolescent stage is I
think out of the question
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#22:1:A>
It 's unhealthy and uh you wouldn't want to do that <O> laughter
 </O> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#23:1:A>
Alright one other way by which we we assert assert our our desire
for self-regulation is <,> uh yeah this was shared last time we feel very
much distrusted if <,> we feel very much distrusted if they ask us where are
you going with whom are you going and uh where will you be going okay what
time are you coming back
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#24:1:A>
Okay uh in other words bottom-line the adolescent is saying trust
me so that I can I can manage myself better
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#25:1:A>
If you don't trust me then all the more probably I will foul up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#26:1:A>
Okay so adolescence really is a time where we are most concerned
about managing ourselves and testing the grounds for self-regulation just a
minute Teresa and if these are not allowed by parents then you have a rebel
in your house
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#27:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#28:1:B>
Just like uhm rooming in <unclear> words </unclear> <indig> sa
 </indig> family <indig> namin </indig> <unclear> words </unclear> Mom I have
this party to go to <unclear> 3 words </unclear> I 'm gonna wear this dress
 <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#29:1:A>
Including that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#30:1:B>
Oo <indig> lahat </indig> set out <indig> lahat </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#31:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#32:1:B>
<indig> O sige </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#33:1:A>
Alright in other words you 're saying that uh if all the
information all the data needed by your parents are already provided for or
provided by you then it makes uh it provides <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#34:1:B>
It will assure you <unclear> words </unclear> still <indig> 
nasa </indig> <unclear> 1 word </unclear> <indig> ka na </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#35:1:A>
<unclear> 1 word </unclear> <indig> ka na </indig> of <indig> 'no
 </indig> being given information
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#36:1:A>
Okay let us add some more input
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#37:1:A>
These were the things shared last time <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#38:1:A>
Let us add some some other leading interests and concerns and maybe
you can check it out whether this really was a concern of yours
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#39:1:A>
Uh primary and foremost is appearance isn't it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#40:1:A>
Okay adolescents are very concerned about appearance because from
experience you know that it is a major factor in what in being accepted by
others
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#41:1:A>
So there is this concern as to how you look uh body build skin
complexion uh breath how you smell <O> laughter </O> okay isn't it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#42:1:A>
Uh also uh following latest fashion and style
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#43:1:A>
In fact you know some some adolescents uh worry a lot about you
know being <mention> in </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#44:1:A>
You see that adolescent culture can exert a lot of pressure on us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#45:1:A>
Don't you experience that what to wear uh if I wear this I am I
feel I think I look <indig> baduy </indig> and I 'd rather not
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#46:1:A>
So there are two there are two courses of action
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#47:1:A>
One either one will withdraw or exert a lot of effort go go through
uh a lot of uh maybe go out of your way to really be <mention> in </mention> 
as far as your crowd is concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#48:1:A>
What else what are other concerns as far as appearance is concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#49:1:A>
Body measurements I was talking about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#50:1:A>
Legs waist arms <indig> di ba </indig> if you 're tall or short or
things of that kind hair on the body you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#51:1:A>
So <,> girls in particular go through a lot of inconvenience just
so they will be good-looking okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#52:1:A>
One case in point
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#53:1:A>
Those of you who wear braces <indig> di ba </indig> it 's such an
inconvenient uh <,> what is that it 's such an inconvenient appurtenance you
know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#54:1:A>
Uh but I know of somebody who has been wearing braces for thirteen
years <&> Some reactions from the students </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#55:1:A>
Thirteen thirteen

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#56:1:C>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#57:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#59:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#60:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#66:1:E>
Three and a half

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#67:1:A>
Three and a half
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#68:1:A>
Was it fun <O> laughter </O> okay that 's a case in point you know
uh it 's you know you go out of your way to a lot through a lot of <indig> 
nagsa </indig> suffer I mean a lot of inconvenience so your teeth will look
nice okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#69:1:A>
Uh and also a lot of expense <O> laughter </O> very expensive
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#70:1:A>
But but <.> be </.> but because you know there is a lot of premium
attached to good looks
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#71:1:A>
Uhm in other words one major obsession of adolescents is looks
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#72:1:A>
What about the guys what what are the what are the what are the
concerns of the guys as far as as far as appearance is concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#73:1:A>
Oh don't tell me Vic you are not interested in uh following fads
and teenage what do you call that teenage fashion <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#74:1:A>
You did not think about it never thought of it with all your
friends <&> student answers but inaudible </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#75:1:A>
<indig> Ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#76:1:A>
Nothing out of the ordinary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#77:1:A>
Anyway uh this this is a major area of concern and worry of
adolescents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#78:1:A>
You want to look good you want to be accepted and you want to be
you want to be uhm have a nice appearance because it is at this time that the
opposite sex is also another major area of interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#79:1:A>
All right appearance I don't think there is any question about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#80:1:A>
All of us have gone <,> I have gone through that you 're going
through it and uh it is uh for me a an established fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#81:1:A>
Now second another area of interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#82:1:A>
Check this out
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#83:1:A>
Uhm creative self-expression
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#84:1:A>
Did you at one point write poems <&> students answer in chorus </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#85:1:A>
Yes no <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#86:1:A>
Uh going back now try to read your poems that you have written you
know how
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#87:1:A>
Okay poems uh letter writing uh <.> stor </.> short story writing
and uh well another another outlet for self expression is the diary uh the
diary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#88:1:A>
Now <,> so <,> do you think this is a lot okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#89:1:A>
Let me put it this way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#90:1:A>
A lot of creative work of adolescents <,> are mainly <,> attempts
at self-expression emotional self-expression rather than sheer talent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#91:1:A>
Do you agree do you agree
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#92:1:A>
All of you did it <indig> 'no </indig> all of you went through it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#93:1:A>
Now do you think that you have talent <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#94:1:A>
There is the talent that really uh the real thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#95:1:A>
Actually this is uhm our creative work our creative writings are of
course indications of cognitive maturation okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#96:1:A>
They are signals you know they are signs that we are going through
the cognitive maturation phase but at the same time it is serving us a very
important function and that is emotional expression
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#97:1:A>
Now do you ever wonder uh you have a question there Rosa
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#98:1:A>
Okay do you ever wonder why you also talk a lot during this stage
adolescence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#99:1:A>
Particularly the early adolescence there is so much you know
talking you just you know when you see friends <indig> parang </indig> you
can't stop talking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#100:1:A>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#101:1:A>
There is just so much to talk about
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#102:1:A>
Well again this is one form of expressing oneself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#103:1:A>
When you talk on the phone it 's just endless and you know to the
dismay of parents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#104:1:A>
Parents you know uh get very much irritated get very much uh uh
pissed you know by by burning telephone lines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#105:1:A>
But of course if you look at it from the perspective of emotional
expression you know developing conversational skills and the like which is a
need and interest of adolescents then perhaps parents can become more
understanding about this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#106:1:A>
Now uh do you also wonder why televiewing okay is a very important
occupation preoccupation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#107:1:A>
Movie going alright
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#108:1:A>
Uh some did did some did you listen also to soap operas <O> 
laughter </O> okay okay soap operas
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#109:1:A>
Now what what is the function of this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#110:1:A>
Well do do you know what the function of it watching television
romantic stories <foreign> etcetera etcetera </foreign> <unclear> word
 </unclear> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#111:1:F>
I recall watching soap operas <unclear> words </unclear> they
are able to distinguish the good and bad side of it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#112:1:A>
Well okay the good and bad side of it but you know we 're
talking of adolescents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#113:1:A>
What is the what is the function performed or played by this uh by
watching television you know you like you like going to the movies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#114:1:A>
It 's a very important activity a primary activity in fact
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#115:1:A>
Why <,> Ina
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#116:1:A>
Do you see what this is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#117:1:A>
You know do you know that this is also a form of ventilation for
adolescents a form of ventilation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#118:1:A>
When you see let 's say your problems being acted out here you
know by uh by by Sharon Cuneta by Sheryl Cruz and the like <O> laughter </O> 
or uh you know uh on television for example Manilyn Reynes on uh <mention> 
Young Love Sweet Love </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#119:1:A>
You know that is one form by one way by which you can express
yourself emotionally
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#120:1:A>
Well it is not expression in the real sense of uh the term but it
is one way of ventilating things that are already being experienced by the
adolescent okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#121:1:A>
All right uhm <&> a question from a student not caught on tape
 </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#122:1:A>
Oh vocation <,> choice of a course yes <,,> this again is one very
important interest and concern of the adolescent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#123:1:A>
Maybe at this point you have made a decision already have you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#124:1:A>
Are you settled in the course that you are in or you 're still
entertaining second thoughts about continuing on in the course or wanting to
shift to some other you know some other uh areas of specialization
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#125:1:A>
It 's not uncommon though you know to hear of some some teenagers
who in their second year have not at this at that point decided on a course
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#126:1:A>
I have seen adolescents who move from one course to the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#127:1:A>
Fortunately probably for you here in La Salle it 's not easy to
shift okay it 's not easy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#128:1:A>
They don't make it easy for you but in some other universities you
know you can shift from one course to the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#129:1:A>
So that many are in the university for several years without
finishing a course because they move from one they shift from one course to
another
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#130:1:A>
I know of some people who even in their third year fourth year are
still not happy about the course they landed in
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-014#131:1:A>
Mainly probably because of the lack of intelligent decision-making
process or lack of assistance you know in the in the uh decision-making
process for a for a course </I> 1
