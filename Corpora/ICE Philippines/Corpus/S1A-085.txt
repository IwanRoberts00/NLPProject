<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#1:1:A>
Yeah but there was a script

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#2:1:B>
What script

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#3:1:A>
Remember the time when I had to record something for Equitable P C I Bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#4:1:A>
There was a script

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#5:1:B>
It was not Equitable P C I Bank at that time

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#6:1:A>
No it wasn't

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#7:1:B>
No it was called Equitable Banking Corporation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#8:1:A>
Oh is that right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#9:1:A>
What ever did you do with that recording I never heard about it again <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#10:1:B>
I didn't hear anything about it and you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#11:1:A>
They didn't like it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#12:1:B>
No I think <,> I don't think it 's because they didn't like it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#13:1:B>
They were they were a little shy to they were a little embarrassed to ask you to come back 'cause there were things that they would like to to do again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#14:1:B>
Like uhm maybe put more pauses or something like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#15:1:B>
Just put more pauses or maybe put some more or maybe to try another way to record your voice because they used another they were thinking of doing something else for <,> putting the <,> the voice recording into a digital format

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#17:1:A>
All right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#18:1:B>
Actually that that project is not was never used
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#19:1:B>
It hasn't been used 'cause when it was done the bank had to merge with P C I already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#20:1:B>
So we just <O> cough </O> tried it on we just tried the program with maybe one class and they had to pick out certain uh items like the history of the bank was not taken up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#22:1:B>
I don't remember exactly 'cause at the time when they wanted to reprogram or re- uh uh how do you call this remake or do the recording again I was already on training
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#24:1:B>
So they looked for somebody else to record the the voice part
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#25:1:B>
So and because there was already a merging of the new bank you know of the two banks they had to re-design the program
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#26:1:B>
Now we have a new training program for that the new orientation but they have taken out the history and the functional you know descriptions I 'm sorry the descriptions of the functional the functions of the the organizations

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#29:1:A>
But it was still going to be used for orientation right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#30:1:A>
So they decided <{1> <[1> to </[1> make a new program for orientation <{2> <[2> and then </[2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#31:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#33:1:B>
<[2> There 's still </[2> </{2> an orientation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#34:1:B>
Actually it 's been running
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#35:1:B>
Some of the modules are are used like ah like the parts for customer service parts about values orientation uh and the security
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#36:1:B>
But about the the bank 's organization <.> its </.> itself it is not it was not done on any electronic medium
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#37:1:B>
They just asked somebody you know from the human resources division to <.> des </.> describe or to talk about the organization and the history because right now everything is in transition
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#38:1:B>
So we still don't know how to <,> how to put it in anything permanent like an or something electronic because it would be difficult for us to edit or re-edit or to call the artists again because nothing is final yet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#39:1:B>
It 's still in transition
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#40:1:B>
A lot of the uh units of the bank are still integrated especially the branches
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#41:1:B>
So anything about its history except for the fact that it 's already on the fiftieth year <indig> e </indig> most of the things are still you know are still they 're not floating but it 's still moving and it 's still and it 's still how do you call this it 's still going through changes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#43:1:B>
So a lot of the personnel are still being moved around there 's still re-deployment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#45:1:B>
We are taking in new officers we are taking in new you know new employees at the at the lowest level
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#47:1:B>
Actually we 're open for hiring

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#48:1:A>
But then all the more you need like a program <{> <[> for orienting </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#49:1:B>
<[> This is a nice sofa </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#50:1:B>
What

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#51:1:A>
All the more you need uh like a program to orient these people that you 're taking in
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#52:1:A>
For example to take uh for the new officers of P C I Bank to be integrated to the new bank Equitable tradition or whatever that is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#53:1:A>
So all the more you need that program to orient them as to how Equitable started and who the uh who are heading up the different divisions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#54:1:A>
That 's what I remember from the <{> <[> recording </[> that we did a long time ago

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#55:1:B>
<[> It </[> </{> oh but in terms of how to integrate the organization itself the bank saw it more fitting or how do you call this it seems to be more <.> appro </.> appropriate to explain what the bank stands for to explain what are the values work values
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#58:1:B>
What the logo stands for what are why do we have these five elements why do we what are we espousing as an organization
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#61:1:B>
Uh I think the bank saw it as more appropriate to explain especially to those who are not part of the former Equitable Banking Corporation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#62:1:B>
So what we do right now is just describe what the logo the colorful logo means
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#63:1:B>
What is how do you how can you say that the corporate values can be translated or can be uh done in in your work place or as you work
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#64:1:B>
So but the history itself or like what are the different organization units are as I said everything is still going through changes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#65:1:B>
There 's a lot of things that are still happening so what we are doing right now is focusing more on the on what the bank stands for the values that we espouse the vision of the bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#66:1:B>
Basically that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#67:1:B>
Aren't you getting bored with this conversation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#68:1:B>
Aren't we supposed to talk about something else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#69:1:B>
Something nicer something how do you call it more interesting

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#71:1:A>
No no 'cause I was thinking about how proud I was to be the voice talent of <{> <[> Equitable </[> P C I Bank

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#72:1:B>
<[> I know </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#73:1:A>
And I was you were I remember you telling me that you 're gonna come out with commercials and stuff like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#74:1:A>
And that maybe you know if they like my voice maybe they would take my voice as the uh for the commercial that you 're gonna be coming out with
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#75:1:A>
And I was really looking forward to that not so much because uh first time I was ever gonna be a voice talent

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#76:1:B>
There 's a lot of things that 's really going on a lot
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#78:1:B>
Before we had the integration also of the two banks
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#79:1:B>
We had tried I and the other you know other employees tried to we had an audition you know for the voice for the electronic banking.

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#81:1:A>
How come you <{> <[> didn't call me </[> for that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#82:1:B>
<[> You know like for the </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#83:1:B>
I don't think it was for the
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#84:1:B>
No they were looking only for people within the organization and it was not under our unit

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#85:1:A>
<{> <[> Oh </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#86:1:B>
<[> It </[> </{> was not our project it was a project of another unit
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#88:1:B>
So they were <.> jus </.> you know they just wrote down whoever could be available or something like that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#89:1:A>
Didn't you try out for that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#90:1:B>
Yes I did
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#91:1:B>
Like like <mention> press eight for deposit press nine for withdrawal press </mention> you know <mention> press zero </mention> or something like that so

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#92:1:A>
Did you get the job

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#93:1:B>
I don't think the the plan pushed through 'cause because of the integration
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#94:1:B>
P C I already had that I think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#95:1:A>
So you 're just gonna adapt whatever it is that they have

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#96:1:B>
Yeah actually we are using a lot of the things that P C I had before a long time

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#97:1:A>
But I want to be the voice talent
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#98:1:A>
Is there any audition coming up anytime soon <{> <[> for whatever </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#99:1:B>
<[> Well I 'm sure </[> </{> they 're going to make like new videos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#100:1:B>
If you like you can also uh be involved in that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#101:1:A>
Yeah keep me in mind
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#102:1:A>
I don't know it 's just that it was a lot of fun
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#104:1:A>
I had a great time recording that that time that that was like what three days if I 'm not mistaken
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#106:1:A>
Uhm I had a lot of fun recording and I was really looking forward to like seeing the real thing like

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#107:1:B>
Seeing the the

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#108:1:A>
You said there was going <{> <[> be like </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#109:1:B>
<[> The output </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#110:1:A>
Yeah visuals and there was going to be I don't know you told me there was gonna be a lot of things that they 're going to integrate my voice into the program
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#112:1:A>
And I was like really looking forward to that I wanted to see how all these things come about
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#114:1:A>
I 've never had any experience in video production or in program-making or whatever this was the first time

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#116:1:B>
I 'm not sure if the if the slide presentation was done
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#117:1:B>
The audiovisual material is finished or completed already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#118:1:B>
I do know that because they had to re-do you know the voice-recording
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#119:1:B>
They asked Queenie to tape to go through the recording to do the recording rather

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#120:1:A>
I know there 's a lot of things that I have to learn about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#121:1:A>
The pauses that you were talking about and of course my S 's I think are too pronounced
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#122:1:A>
Even when I was singing for the choir at Saint Cyprian 's that was the one thing that my director would always caution me about uhm my S 's are too pronounced
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#123:1:A>
And I guess when you 're recording

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#124:1:B>
I don't think there 's anything wrong with your S 's

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#125:1:A>
Oh is that right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#126:1:B>
Well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#127:1:A>
Did you <{1> <[1> listen </[1> to that taping <{2> <[2> again </[2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#128:1:B>
<[1> You see </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#129:1:B>
<[2> You see </[2> </{2> it 's different
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#130:1:B>
I have listened I have heard the the voice recording but I don't really remember exactly the details
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#132:1:B>
Maybe I should ask Kitty to look for it so that you you can hear and listen to it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#133:1:A>
I 'd be too embarrassed <{> <[> though </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#134:1:B>
<[> I do </[> </{> know that we placed it in C D

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#135:1:A>
Yeah I wanna see I I wanna 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#136:1:A>
See that 's what I wanna see that 's what I wanna hear especially if you integrated the visuals 'cause I wanna see how what you were gonna do with it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#138:1:A>
I was very curious about that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#139:1:B>
It 's very easy I can show you now how you do it <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#141:1:B>
Oh <{> <[> but but from <.> trans </.> transferring </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#142:1:A>
<[> No but my voice </[> </{> yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#143:1:B>
Transferring your voice from the magnetic tape <{> <[> to a </[> digital one

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#144:1:A>
<[> That 's right </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#145:1:A>
That 's right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#146:1:B>
Oh we have a different uh software for that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#147:1:A>
Then and then you integrate it with the visuals and I want to see you know I wanna hear my voice and then I wanna see what kind of visuals you come up with
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#149:1:A>
Like see the whole thing the whole project

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#150:1:B>
I will ask Kitty 'cause I do know that it was already finished

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#151:1:A>
Oh is that right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#152:1:B>
Yes they 're already using it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#153:1:A>
But you 're not gonna use it huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#154:1:B>
But it 's not your voice that was used <{> <[> because they had to </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#155:1:A>
<[> It 's not my voice </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#156:1:B>
No they had to do the recording I 've been saying all <.> ov </.> since the beginning

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#158:1:A>
See I want to see the whole thing and my voice
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#159:1:A>
See I keep emphasizing my voice because I wanted like my friends my my family members <{> <[> my old teachers could hear it </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#160:1:B>
<[> They did not use your voice as far as I know </[> </{> they did not use your voice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#162:1:A>
Now I 'm sad

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#163:1:B>
I 'm sorry

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#164:1:A>
I know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#165:1:A>
Yeah 'cause Becky was asking about it too
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#166:1:A>
And of course she 's seeing all the commercials about you know Equitable P C I Bank on television these days and she goes well I thought you know that you were being considered for that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#167:1:A>
And I said well I thought so too but I guess they decided to go another way 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#168:1:A>
She said well she goes what happened to that voice uh the tape right that you did for them like a year ago or something 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#169:1:A>
And I said I don't really know uhm I 'm gonna have to ask about it 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#170:1:B>
They did not use your voice <.> alre </.> because there were parts you see some of the things that you said were like in full paragraphs <{> <[> right </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#171:1:A>
<[> That 's </[> </{> right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#172:1:B>
We found out that although you would stop at particular points

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#173:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#174:1:B>
We found out that those paragraphs took so long

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#175:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#176:1:B>
We couldn't cut them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#177:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#178:1:B>
In the middle

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#179:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#180:1:B>
While you were talking on the recording
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#181:1:B>
We couldn't stop or just cut it there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#182:1:B>
We found out that we had to record again

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#183:1:A>
I see

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#184:1:B>
But since again as I said a while ago I was already on training they were a little shy I think they were embarrassed to call you again for free

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#186:1:A>
Uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#187:1:B>
Since you did it for free
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#188:1:B>
They and you were you know somebody outside of the company they didn't want to risk that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#189:1:B>
And then uh see if you were working for the bank it is understood that you might get it you know you might do it for free but then we pay you for overtime

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#190:1:A>
Uh I see

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#191:1:B>
You can file for overtime
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#192:1:B>
But in your case you 're a you know you 're not a member of the organization you were uh you were just doing you were <.> doi </.> just doing this you know as a favor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#194:1:B>
But my boss doesn't like those things where you know doing something for favors

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#196:1:A>
I wish I could have told her that it was enough for me to like <{> <[> to like <.> s </.> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#197:1:B>
<[> See the whole </[> </{> production

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#198:1:A>
See the whole production
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#199:1:A>
You know that was just something that I was really interested in and that was just something that I know would be like a once in a lifetime experience it 's not my line of work <.> i </.> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#201:1:A>
Where I am at right now I don't think I 'm ever gonna be able to do something like that again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#202:1:A>
So I was like that would have been really neat
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-085#203:1:A>
At any rate I 'm sorry 

 </I>
