<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#2:1>
Dear friend,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#3:1>
It is a cloudy but Christmassy cool Wednesday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#4:1>
I started the day early bringing the children to school and hurrying
back to join Thelma for breakfast where we talked about mostly about our
activities for the day.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#5:1>
Soon I was off again, first to the bank to withdraw some cash, to Ever
Grand Central in Caloocan for deliveries, to another bank to remit payment to
our <foreign> loofah </foreign> supplier in General Santos City in Cotabato,
and then finally to Dani Mae 's school to fetch her from her Kinder <&>
=Kindergarten </&> class.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#6:1>
We were home in time for lunch with Thelma.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#7:1>
After a brief afternoon nap, I spent the rest of the day reviewing the
production schedule, preparing the next day 's deliveries, answering phone
calls and playing with Dani Mae. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#8:1>
I have just described to you a sample of my present routine after
leaving the corporate world as an employee for many years where my life has
been a daily grind of commuting if not driving through traffic and keeping a
regular 8 to 5 office hours five days a week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#9:1>
I resigned from ICLARM effective end of September, but it was only
in early November did I finally leave when my replacement came.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#10:1>
My decision to resign was brought about mainly by the increasing
needs of our family business.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#11:1>
Thelma and I also felt I have been spending precious time ( four to
five hours daily) just commuting from Valenzuela to Makati and back.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#12:1>
I consider this decision as a major transition in my life and just
like in many of life 's transitions, Thelma and I ( and even the children)
are still adjusting to all the changes but enjoying every bit of them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#13:1>
The present arrangement is working fine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#14:1>
Thelma spends most of her time outside marketing, making client
calls, purchasing materials, and so forth.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#15:1>
I stay home taking care of the office, overseeing the production and
pitching in as driver for Thelma and the children occasionally.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#16:1>
On some occasions, the two of us meet clients together to discuss
business proposals.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#17:1>
In any case, we feel we are now spending more time together than
before. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#18:1>
Come to think of it now, I am not alone in the family who is in
some sort of transition or another.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#19:1>
Recently, Thelma discovered to her dismay that she could no longer
read the small prints in a book, magazine or newspaper and is now reluctantly
considering a change to bi-focals...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#20:1>
Pizza is in her last year in high school and is presently agonizing
over what course to take and in what university to go to.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#21:1>
She is torn between taking a course in Accounting or Child
Development either at De La Salle, UST, or Miriam College...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#22:1>
Nico is experiencing growth pains as he enters early manhood and is
anxious over the shift to a regular school next year ( he is now in a private
semi-tutorial school)...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#23:1>
Dana who will soon enter her teens is also in her last year in
elementary school and is wondering whether she wants to go to a
co-educational high school or stay at St. Theresa 's, an all-girls school...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#24:1>
Then there is Dani Mae who is both anxious and excited about
transferring to a &ldquo; big &rdquo; school and start Prep. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#25:1>
At this point, I must admit I did not know what to say when I
began to write this annual Christmas letter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#26:1>
I asked Thelma what she wanted me to include and she just said:
<quote> &ldquo; Just tell them what has been happening to the family this
year. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#27:1>
I started that first paragraph and suddenly realized I was talking
about my own transition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#28:1>
They say that transitions are necessary as we journey through
life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#29:1>
They give us time to reflect, to take stock of everything that is
going on in our lives, to make us aware of life 's meaning so that we can
live more fully according to God 's plan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#30:1>
But we all know that transitions are also difficult times.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#31:1>
These are times for decisions that can either make or break us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#32:1>
These are times when we feel deeply the need for one another, for
family and friends, for God. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#33:1>
In retrospect then, I just wanted to say: <quote> &ldquo; This is
what 's happening to the family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#34:1>
All of us are in some sort of transition this year, but we are all
going through them smoothly.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#35:1>
Because of these transitions we have become closer to one another, to
you and to the good Lord.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#36:1>
Thanks to all of you, your prayers and your concern.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#37:1>
This Christmas, we shall offer our masses and prayers for all of you,
that as you journey through your own transitions you too will be guided by
Him Who on Christmas day became like one of us so that we may have a full
life. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#38:1>
Love and regards from all of us,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#39:1>
Danny, Thelma & children <&> handwritten addition </&>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#40:1>
Wish we could get together.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#41:1>
Do you have the time?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#42:1>
Hope everything 's fine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#43:1>
Happy Holidays! </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#44:1>

01 December 2001

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#46:2>
Dear friend -

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#47:2>
<mention> &ldquo; Can't Stop Christmas &rdquo; </mention> is
Martin Nievera 's latest and frequently hummed song today.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#48:2>
I just feel it expresses the mood of many at this moment as we count
the days before Christmas.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#49:2>
Yes, nobody or nothing can't stop Christmas.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#50:2>
Not the traditional Grinch in our society, not the worsening economic
situation, not the kidnappings, not the war in Afghanistan nor the never
ending conflict in Mindanao, and not all the problems in our government
today.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#51:2>
Christmas is for all of us and it is worth waiting for.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#52:2>
If only to remind us about the Love made flesh.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#53:2>
If only to have the chance once again to get in touch with loved ones
like you as we do now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#54:2>
The year 2001 started inauspiciously for us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#55:2>
In the evening of January 22 this year, his birthday, Danny woke up
as if his whole body and the room were spinning wildly.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#56:2>
He was so dizzy and unable to stand.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#57:2>
He fell from his side of their bed and literally crawled to the
bathroom to throw up.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#58:2>
After one hour with no relief, Nico drove him to the hospital with
Thelma while Pizza and Dana together with <indig> Ka </indig> Romy Jacobo, a
neighbor, followed in another car.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#59:2>
He stayed confined for four days and was given several tests.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#60:2>
The diagnosis: vertigo.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#61:2>
The spinning sensation stopped after two days but not the dizziness.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#62:2>
Further tests revealed that his inner left ear was irreversibly
damaged by infection affecting his sense of balance, but fortunately not his
hearing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#63:2>
The ringing in his left ear ( <foreign> tinnitus </foreign> ) also
got enhanced.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#64:2>
For months he tried all kinds of medicines and physical exercises his
doctors prescribed, but to no avail.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#65:2>
With no relief in sight, he decided to try Alternative Medicine last
August and since then has been on acupuncture sessions twice a week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#66:2>
Danny is now very slowly but surely recovering.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#67:2>
His acupuncture sessions have been reduced to once a week last
November.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#68:2>
He has also enrolled at the Center for Family Ministries at the
Ateneo for a Diploma in Family Counseling starting the second semester as
part of his therapy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#69:2>
March 2001 was significant for the family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#70:2>
Thelma reached another milestone as she turned 50!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#71:2>
Except for the inevitable discomforts of menopause, our golden girl
continues to enjoy relatively good health this year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#72:2>
Thank God for that!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#73:2>
Aside from managing the family 's <foreign> loofah </foreign>
business, she continues to be very busy as ever.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#74:2>
She still has her choir group, her monthly outings with her De La
Salle <indig> <it> barkada </it> </indig> , her occasional meetings with her
high school classmates, her weekly charismatic prayer meetings and our
Couples for Christ group.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#75:2>
To all these have been added her responsibilities as Coordinator (
with Danny) for the Family Ministries of our parish. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#76:2>
March 2001 is also when Nico turned 20.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#77:2>
Nico is now in his last two terms in his course at De La Salle 's
College of St. Benilde.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#78:2>
He is due to graduate with a degree in Business Management major in
Computer Applications by the first term next school year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#79:2>
I am sure all of you who have followed Nico 's story will understand
that the whole family is looking forward with much anticipation to Nico 's
graduation from college. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#80:2>
In May, the whole family hied off to Puerto Galera in Mindoro for
a weekend of family bonding, swimming, card games, eating, sleeping and just
plain relaxing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#81:2>
We took the family van all the way to Batangas City port and from
there took a fast ferry to Puerto Galera Resort in the island of Mindoro west
of Batangas.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#82:2>
The place actually fell short of our expectations as it offered very
little in terms of swimming in clear water and white sand beaches just like
Boracay.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#83:2>
The place is actually a haven for mountain-climbers, scuba-diving and
snorkeling that did not attract any of us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#84:2>
But just the same, we made the most out of it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#85:2>
After all what was important was that the family was together. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#86:2>
On June 3 this year, it was Mae 's turn to celebrate her
birthday, her 11th.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#87:2>
Mae has grown much taller this year as evidenced by her outgrowing
most of her children 's clothes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#88:2>
She now shares some of Pizza 's and Dana 's things to the
consternation of the two older sisters.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#89:2>
She is now in Grade V and continues to excel in her class.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#90:2>
As you might have guessed - - yes, she is a Harry Potter fan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#91:2>
She has read all four Harry Potter books and was the most excited in
the family when the film came to theaters in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#92:2>
To date she cannot recall anymore how many times she has watched the
film. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#93:2>
July was another memorable month for us but especially for Dana.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#94:2>
She turned 18 last July 16!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#95:2>
And as it was her wish, we gave a Debutante 's party for her last
July 21 at Annabel 's Restaurant in place of a trip to the US.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#96:2>
( The family picture that accompanies this letter was taken from that
party.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#97:2>
It was a joyous occasion for us all.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#98:2>
Dana 's immediate relatives from Danny 's and Thelma 's families were
all there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#99:2>
And so were her closest friends both from high school and from
College of St. Benilde where she is now in her third year taking a course in
Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#100:2>
November 04, 2001 was Pizza 's special day when she turned into
a full-blown woman at 22.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#101:2>
Pizza, apparently has already found her true calling and career in
life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#102:2>
And we are so happy for her.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#103:2>
She is now a pre-school teacher at Waldorf Schoof of Manila ( a
member of the Waldorf Schools worldwide) and is immensely enjoying it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#104:2>
On her spare time, she tutors children at the Kumon Center nearby
and also manages to help out with our neighbors ' children with their class
lessons here at home.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#105:2>
She also continues to help Thelma with the clerical needs of our
business and acts as Thelma 's personal assistant whenever she has the time.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#106:2>
So there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#107:2>
We have once again brought you up to date with our lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#108:2>
As I said at the start of this letter, if only because of getting
connected with you once again, Christmas is worth waiting for.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#109:2>
Let us continue praying for each other, for peace in the world, and
for inner peace within all of us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#110:2>
Allow us to hear from you, too.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#111:2>
MALIGAYANG PASKO! <&> Filipino for MERRY CHRISTMAS </&> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#112:2>
With much love and regards,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#113:2>
Danny, Thelma, Piz, Nix, Dan and Mae <&> handwritten addition </&>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#114:2>
Hermie texted me to say she 's missing our group sojourn at
Dasma, & is looking forward to our next visit there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#115:2>
Do you think this is possible to organize next year?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#116:2>
Let us keep each other in our prayers - happy holidays! </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-006#117:2>
- Thelma </I>
