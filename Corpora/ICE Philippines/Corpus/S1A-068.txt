<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#1:1:A>
You girls actually read this stuff
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#2:1:A>
I mean look at this The Boyfriend Clinic 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#3:1:B>
What 's with it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#4:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#5:1:A>
I mean looking at the <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#6:1:A>
<quote> I 've been going out with this guy for four weeks but he barely acts like my boyfriend </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#7:1:A>
Like we say in the parlance of the industry this is so much <indig> tsu-tsu </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#8:1:A>
I mean <O> laughter </O> I mean look at this I mean what 's the basis for this stuff
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#9:1:A>
Yeah actually yeah like this one <quote> I love my boyfriend but I can't stop thinking about this other guy </quote> <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#10:1:B>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#11:1:B>
It 's common occurrence nowadays

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#12:1:A>
Really <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#13:1:B>
Yeah it 's because you 're not

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#14:1:A>
I 'm not human

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#15:1:B>
No not that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#16:1:B>
It 's because you 're a guy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#17:1:A>
<.> Rea </.> you know that is one reason why there is so much strife in the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#18:1:A>
When people start thinking of us like oh you 're a guy you won't understand I mean hello

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#19:1:B>
That 's true it 's basically true

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#21:1:A>
No no no no no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#22:1:A>
There may be differences between people but when people communicate and they try to have this mind set that they can understand each other that will at least solve the problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#23:1:A>
Even if the person can't exactly I mean I don't have to be I don't have to have gone through the Holocaust to know how it feels to be what inside the <?> pans and burners </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#25:1:A>
No pans and burners uh I mean you haven't been put inside one of those burners right the ones in Auschwitz

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#27:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#28:1:A>
But you have an idea how it feels how it <{> <[> would feel </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#29:1:B>
<[> Uh uhm uh uhm </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#30:1:A>
Precisely my point

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#31:1:B>
Uh okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#32:1:A>
You don't have to be I mean instead of looking at these things I think girls and guys should just <,> talk 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#33:1:B>
Talk more

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#34:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#35:1:A>
Like talk more relate more like like this

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#36:1:B>
Is she your type <&> speaker A laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#37:1:B>
What what 's wrong with it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#39:1:A>
You know that 's what I meant by in saying that it 's probably the reason why most girls have such a skewed perception of me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#40:1:A>
I mean where is the basis for this stuff
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#41:1:A>
What 's the where 's

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#42:1:B>
Personal experiences

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#43:1:A>
Where 's the
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#44:1:A>
But that 's anecdote
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#45:1:A>
Have you seen an actual research an actual research <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#46:1:A>
In actual research there are two types of evidence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#47:1:A>
There 's one where you can actually cross reference it through studies like like when you put up a bibliography of stuff like the books you read
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#49:1:A>
That you actually do a research with all of those protocols and things
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#50:1:A>
And there 's anecdotal evidence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#51:1:A>
This is anecdotal evidence it 's pretty subjective which means it 's subjective
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#53:1:A>
It 's not an objective data like if you say <,,> something like I don't know I guess I just hate it when people try to box you like this one <,> I mean

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#54:1:B>
But sometimes it depends on the person reading

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#55:1:A>
Uh too much Plato on my part <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#56:1:B>
No not really
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#57:1:B>
Because sometimes women just want

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#58:1:A>
To read about stuff like this

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#59:1:B>
Yeah to read stuff like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#60:1:B>
But aside from that to have in to have an inter-connection with another woman

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#61:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#62:1:B>

Well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#109:1:A>
Yes no <{> <[> I 'm talking </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#110:1:B>
<[> Well </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#111:1:A>
I 'm talking like I don't understand this stuff but I actually do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#112:1:A>
I mean I wanna be chief analyst of the <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#113:1:B>
But you 're just being human

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#114:1:A>
Am I forgetting that I 'm not human <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#115:1:B>
No it 's not that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#116:1:B>
It 's just that it 's just that the topics they tackle in those magazines are very <,> very <{> <[> what </[> 
 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#117:1:A>
<[> Normal </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#118:1:B>
Yeah in a way but not all and maybe

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#120:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#121:1:A>
I guess I 'm still coming from the <foreign> gestalt </foreign> I have in reading the <mention> Republic </mention> I mean in the <mention> Republic </mention> in the have you read the <mention> Republic </mention> Plato 's <mention> Republic </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#124:1:B>
Some part not all

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#125:1:A>
In Plato 's <mention> Republic </mention> Plato actually chastises Homer Plato or Socrates or Plato he chastises Homer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#128:1:A>
It 's about saying that Homer teaches the wrong stuff to the Greeks and that 's why they have a sucky state
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#129:1:A>
It 's just like saying why our people are afraid of dying it 's because Homer and some of his contemporaries portrayed death as something bad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#131:1:A>
Like when you die you go to Hades and all this shit happens to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#132:1:A>
So if I was a warrior if it was my job to defend the republic the state so why would I throw my life away if dying would be so bad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#133:1:A>
Where 's the <.> hon </.> <O> stutter </O> look at it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#135:1:B>
'Cause for some there 's glory in dying for your country

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#136:1:A>
But that that 's Plato 's point
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#137:1:A>
That 's not common because the one that they 're exposed to sensitizes their mind for that particular <foreign> gestalt </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#138:1:A>
<{> <[> In their </[> minds dying is bad meaning it 's not it 's not even if you die a glorious death battle this is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#141:1:A>
Remember we 're talking about the Greeks we 're not talking about 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#139:1:B>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#143:1:B>
Okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#144:1:A>
The Norse
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#145:1:A>
We 're not <{> <[> even talking </[> about Christians

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#146:1:B>
<[> Okay </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#147:1:A>
We 're talking about a <foreign> gestalt </foreign> in which when you die you go to hell or rather to Hades
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#148:1:A>
And <{> <[> when </[> you 're there nothing 's fun there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#149:1:B>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#150:1:A>
I mean look at Greek <,> the Greek cosmology
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#151:1:A>
Am I correct with that one yeah the Greek

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#153:1:B>
But why do they portray Hades as a place wherein there are two divisions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#154:1:B>
Well <{1> <[1> that 's </[1> according to the Hercules movies the <{2> <[2> Starworld </[2> movies

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#155:1:A>
<[1> Homer </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#156:1:A>
<[2> Don't </[2> </{2> don't base it on that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#157:1:B>
Well well according to that well according to that there 's these two divisions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#158:1:B>
One is if you die a normal cause or if you did something good in your life you 'll be in <,> in a place like paradise

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#159:1:A>
This is Hercules <.> duri </.> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#160:1:B>
Hercules journey

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#161:1:A>
The Disney Hercules

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#162:1:B>
No Hercules the series Starworld Asia

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#164:1:A>
Of course they 're going to show that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#165:1:A>
It 's called mass media appeal

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#166:1:B>
No that 's what that 's the problem nowadays in mass media

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#167:1:A>
Like this one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#168:1:A>
I guess the reason why I said Plato 's <mention> Republic </mention> and all others
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#169:1:A>
It 's more like this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#170:1:A>
I mean or maybe I 'm just too much the guardian
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#171:1:A>
But anyway like like I said a while ago life is more than just sex
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#172:1:A>
It 's more than just getting an orgy <O> chuckle </O> more than just

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#173:1:B>
Well I agree with that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#174:1:A>
Yes but

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#175:1:B>
Life is more than sex
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#176:1:B>
Life is more than life is more than life itself

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#177:1:A>
But Gail you are one of the leaders you 're conditioned for doing stuff that 's more than this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#178:1:A>
<{> <[> Yes you may </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#179:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> but still I 'm a female and I well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#180:1:A>
Yes but what I 'm saying is

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#181:1:B>
But you see this is a we live in a <?> machoist </?> society <&> speaker A laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#182:1:B>
There are speakin' there are spoken rules regulation on our society that females <{> <[> <,> </[> should abide to 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#183:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#185:1:A>
Uh uhm
 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#186:1:B>
Right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#187:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#188:1:B>
I mean why do women wear high stiletto heels

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#189:1:A>
Do you have to abide by them <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#190:1:B>
Well if you were if you 're a flight stewardess you 're expected to be beautiful to be glamorous to wear red lipsticks and brown eyeshadows peach blush-ons and everything the whole stuff

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#192:1:A>
Uhm the way that women weren't were expected to not vote and not hold say positions such as lawyers politicians and <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#193:1:B>
Uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#194:1:A>
I guess what I 'm just trying to say is uh the reason why I can understand stuff like this like Cosmopolitan magazine heck they they provide jobs don't they

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#195:1:B>
Yeah they do

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#196:1:A>
I don't know I <{> <[> guess </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#198:1:B>
<[> They 'll </[> </{> also show you where where the best where you can buy things at the lowest price

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#199:1:A>
I guess that was just something <{> <[> like </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#200:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#201:1:A>
I mean I guess if it was just about a question of trends I mean this is good
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#203:1:A>
I mean stuff like this it probably chalk it up to dialectics where when thesis and anti-thesis meet in order to come up with a synthesis where I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#205:1:A>
Maybe I 'm just too much ivory tower coming from where I came from <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#206:1:A>
You know how the Atenean thinks sometimes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#207:1:A>
What about if Atenean girls read the same things
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#208:1:A>
Hahaha <O> laughter </O> <{> <[> I think </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#209:1:B>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#210:1:A>
<{> <[> Right </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#211:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> some even read <{> <[> what </[> Y M 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#212:1:A>
<[> I guess </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#213:1:A>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#237:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#244:1:A>
Anyway uhm I guess I 'm just angry at <.> th </.> at the thought that most people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#245:1:A>
Sometimes you tend to believe what the leftists say about current society because of the stuff you see like the media and even the church tries to keep people 's minds down so they don't rise up against the bourgeois <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#246:1:B>
Like what the traditional politicians say right now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#247:1:A>
Not exactly <.> mo </.> like the <indig> trapos </indig> <&> traditional politicians </&> more like well like this instead of teaching people to reach beyond mere animal stuff it 's actually trying to emphasize
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#249:1:A>
You 're sleepy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#250:1:B>
No not

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#251:1:A>
You 're just tired uhm <,> the baby is tired

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#252:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#254:1:A>
Yes you 're twenty-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#255:1:A>
Anyway where were we
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#256:1:A>
Yeah something like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#257:1:A>
It 's <,> I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#258:1:A>
I guess it 's my upbringing I mean my upbringing was more like teaching me that I 'm this that I 'm I can be more than what most people are <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#260:1:A>
Yeah I was brought up to believe in that and in the inherent good within humanity in the potential for humanity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#261:1:A>
So I guess seeing stuff like this trying to keep you in the animal level it 's just like it 's just sad

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#262:1:B>
Uhm uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#263:1:A>
That 's what Plato was trying to say in his <mention> Republic </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#264:1:A>
It 's that 's part of what he was trying to say like it should be that education education should be about trying to teach people to reach their highest potential
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#265:1:A>
Not just give them all the shit of data and that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#266:1:A>
Or just trying to make them run through a system wherein they 're just trying to develop people in order to perpetuate the system
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#267:1:A>
We call them <?> Shicogen </?> in among sci-fi buffs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#268:1:A>
<?> Shicogens </?> salary men

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#269:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#270:1:A>
Wage slaves

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#271:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#272:1:A>
People who are slaves of the Bundy <?> putring </?> <&> imitating sound of Bundy clock </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#273:1:B>
Uh okay <,> <{> <[> okay </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#274:1:A>
<[> I mean </[> </{> how many graduates can honestly chart their own course
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#275:1:A>
I mean I I guess I 'm lucky I 'm an Atenean I mean heck I haven't I sometimes I have the right to choose my own job <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#276:1:A>
But how many people can do that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#277:1:A>
I mean how many people when they graduate just have to take this job because it 's the one being offered

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#278:1:B>
Why is it like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#279:1:B>
Why is the educational system like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-068#280:1:B>
If you graduate from a reputable and known school you easily you can easily get jobs
