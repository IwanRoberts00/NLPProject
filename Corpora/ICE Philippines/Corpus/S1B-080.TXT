<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#1:1:A>
Well first and foremost there are what we call signs and
symptoms of pregnancy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#2:1:A>
Symptoms usually are the patient will usually complain of nausea or
vomiting or dizziness usually in the early morning which is what we call
morning sickness or the medical term for that is hyper- <?> <foreign> emesis
gravidarium </foreign> </?> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#3:1:B>
Now is that always the case when there is a pregnant woman <{> 
 <[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#4:1:A>
<[> Not really </[> </{> not all not all pregnant women
complain of this but mostly <,> uh uh about probably seventy percent

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#5:1:B>
Would complain about nausea <{> <[> and vomiting </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#6:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> will have hyper- <?> <foreign> emesis
gravidarium </foreign> </?> within the first <,> uh up to the twentieth
twentieth week

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#7:1:B>
Up to the twentieth week <,> now <{> <[> <,> </[> yes <,> 
 <indig> doktora </indig> now are there any other symptoms that I might uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#8:1:A>
<[> At the latest the twentieth week </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#9:1:A>
Well if there 's one more symptom which we call the <?> pica </?> 
 <,> <{> <[> which is </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#10:1:B>
<[> Now what 's a <?> pica </?> </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#11:1:A>
The unusual craving for

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#12:1:B>
Food <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#13:1:A>
Unusual food sometimes even some pregnant women will even
resort to eating clay or soil 'cause of the <?> pica </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#14:1:A>
That is what we call in Tagalog <indig> lihi </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#15:1:B>
<?> Pica </?> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#16:1:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#17:1:B>
<?> Pica </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#18:1:B>
Okay <,> so are those the only two symptoms <{> <[> that I have to
observe </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#19:1:A>
<[> Most of the </[> </{> those are the those are the most
common symptoms
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#20:1:A>
Other <.> symp </.> uh other signs will be amenorrhea or the
absence of menses and other another sign will be the <,> uh what do you call
this <,> enlargement of the abdomen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#21:1:A>
Some of some women will also complain of engorgement of the breasts
and hyper-pigmentation or the darkening of the nipples <,> the armpits and
around the neck area

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#22:1:B>
Uhm <,> now <indig> doktora </indig> about the darkening of
the nipples would that go back to normal

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#23:1:A>
Yeah it will after pregnancy it will

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#24:1:B>
Okay so I 'm just curious <O> chuckles </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#25:1:B>
Now the second question is

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#26:1:A>
<O> laughs </O> Uh but the diagnostic of course <,> the only
 <.> ti </.> the only time you can be sure that the patient is pregnant if <,> 
you will get a positive <{> <[> pregnancy test </[> or the you can see it in
the ultrasound that there is a baby in the womb

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#27:1:B>
<[> Pregnancy test </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#28:1:B>
Uh is that possible even in two weeks or one week old <,> <{> <[> 
the ultrasound </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#29:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> <,> uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#30:1:B>
Uh I see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#31:1:B>
Okay <,> so my second question is uh how do I take care of my wife
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#32:1:B>
For example if uh she 's pregnant what are the special precautions
that I have to watch out or I mean what is your suggestion about it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#33:1:A>
Well pregnant women are usually most of the time they feel
lazy they 're so sleepy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#34:1:A>
You just give them uh provide adequate rest and if they are
suffering from hyper- <?> <foreign> emesis gravidarium </foreign> </?> you
can give Vitamin B complex or some <.> an </.> anti-emetic like Bonamine

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#35:1:B>
Just Bonamine

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#36:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#37:1:B>
Would that not affect <indig> ano </indig> have any effect on
the baby <,> <{> <[> the Bonamine </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#38:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{> that 's safe for pregnant women

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#39:1:B>
Uh that 's safe

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#40:1:A>
And of course you give them pre-natal vitamins and iron
preparations because when the patient is pregnant uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#41:1:B>
She would need all the supplies on her body to be <{> <[> 
 <unclear> words </unclear> for the baby </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#42:1:A>
<[> Yeah because uh yeah </[> </{> the baby uses up the iron
in her blood and calcium supplements also sometimes are needed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#43:1:B>
So now what foods do you suggest

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#44:1:A>
Actually a pregnant woman can eat anything she wants <.> ex
 </.> uh but <{> <[> of course </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#45:1:B>
<[> Except me </[> </{> <O> laughs </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#46:1:A>
No but of course we would suggest nutritious food <{> <[> for
her </[> for her good and for the good of her baby
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#47:1:A>
Uh we would shy away from junk food because that has no nutritional
value

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#48:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#49:1:B>
Soft drinks

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#50:1:A>
All the more because it just contains sugar and the weight
will just go to the mother

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#51:1:B>
Not to the baby

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#52:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#53:1:B>
Okay <,> now what are the critical months that I have to watch
out is it the first the second

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#54:1:A>
It 's usually the first three months or the first trimester
 <{> <[> because </[> during this time the baby is just being formed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#55:1:B>
<[> Uh-huh </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#56:1:A>
So during this time it is uh <,> if the mother gets sick or
she takes medicines that are not allowed the baby can turn out to be deformed
or with congenital abnormalities

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#57:1:B>
In in the first <{> <[> month </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#58:1:A>
<[> After the </[> </{> third <.> tri </.> after the first
trimester <{> <[> <,> </[> all the baby does is grow up so most of his parts
are complete already

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#59:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#60:1:B>
How about the last trimester <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#61:1:B>
Is that also the critical <indig> ay </indig> a critical stage that
it might be a premature birth if something <{> <[> happens </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#62:1:A>
<[> It depends </[> </{> it depends

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#63:1:B>
It depends <,> case-to-case basis

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#64:1:A>
Case-to-case basis because like <.> placen </.> placenta
 <foreign> previa </foreign> or <foreign> abruptio </foreign> placenta they
usually happen later on

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#65:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#66:1:A>
So you just have to be that 's why it <{1> <[1> is </[1> 
necessary for the <{2> <[2> pregnant </[2> woman to go to <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> 
to prenatal check-ups monthly

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#67:1:B>
<[1> Well </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#68:1:B>
<[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#69:1:B>
<[3> Now I have a </[3> </{3> cousin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#70:1:B>
Monthly <{> <[> prenatal check-ups </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#71:1:A>
<[> And then every </[> </{> two weeks starting on the seventh
month <{> <[> <,> </[> and then weekly on the on the <,> ninth month

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#72:1:B>
<[> Uh-huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#73:1:B>
Now <,> what if what would happen if uh during the first trimester
 <,> uh <,> my wife would contact what do you call this uh <,> <indig> 
bulutong tubig ano 'yon </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#74:1:A>
Chicken pox

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#75:1:B>
Chicken pox yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#76:1:B>
What would happen <,> I mean would that be a big effect on the baby
or or what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#77:1:B>
Or would that have no effect on the baby <,> at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#78:1:B>
<{> <[> Or </[> nobody is sure

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#79:1:A>
<[> Well </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#80:1:A>
You can never be sure if <.> y </.> uh sometimes we get pregnant
women who get chicken pox early in their pregnancy but the babies turn out
normal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#81:1:A>
What is the most feared sickness during pregnancy is German measles
 <{> <[> or rubella </[> <,> because chances are the baby will come out
deformed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#82:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{> I see

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#83:1:A>
He will have congenital cataract <foreign> microcephaly
 </foreign> or small head congenital heart disease and all those other things
 <,> and <.> ment </.> mental retardation also

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#84:1:B>
So we really have to avoid German measles

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#85:1:A>
Yes <,> now if you get rubella shots <&> speaker B coughs </&> 
if

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#86:1:B>
Is that advisable

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#87:1:A>
No not to pregnant woman <,> to to single women or pregnant
 <.> wo </.> <,> single

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#88:1:B>
Before getting pregnant

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#89:1:A>
<indig> 'Yon nga </indig> if you have to get a rubella shot
you have to wait six months before you can get pregnant

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#90:1:B>
Uh I see

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#91:1:A>
Or else

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#92:1:B>
Or else the vaccine

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#93:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#94:1:B>
It might affect the baby also within six months
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#95:1:B>
Now <,> now I 'm a dentist and I want to know do you suggest local
anesthesia for extraction during pregnancy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#96:1:A>
As much as possible minor surgical procedures should be
deferred until after delivery unless it is absolutely necessary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#97:1:A>
If for example you have an impacted molar which is causing the pain
 <,> the patient so <{> <[> much pain </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#98:1:B>
<[> Intense pain </[> </{> yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#99:1:A>
Well you should have to weigh the the pros and the cons the
benefits for the patient and <,> possible adverse effects to the baby

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#100:1:B>
Uh okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#101:1:A>
If it 's absolutely necessary then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#102:1:B>
Now

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#103:1:A>
It is up to you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#104:1:B>
Now for example it is just a filling <,> if it is just <{> 
 <[> a filling </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#105:1:A>
<[> Do you use </[> </{> local anesthesia for filling

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#106:1:B>
Yes we use local anesthesia
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#107:1:B>
Now <,> now what would happen if I use local anesthesia what <,> 
what are the effects
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#108:1:B>
Would it go to the placental barrier or or would just pass the
baby or what do you think would happen

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#109:1:A>
I 'm not so sure about local anesthesia but we usually advise
them

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#110:1:B>
To avoid as <{> <[> much as possible </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#111:1:A>
<[> To avoid </[> </{> as much as possible

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#112:1:B>
Okay <,> so the interview is finished as of now and thank you
very much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#113:1:A>
Any any further questions <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#114:1:B>
Okay

<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#117:2:A>

Dr <@> Del Fierro </@> judging from your uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#119:2:A>
Uhm from my

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#120:2:B>
Your opening remarks <{> <[> I </[> suspected that maybe you

 <$A>

<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#122:2:A>
<[> About </[> </{>

<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#123:2:B>
Your signature

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#124:2:A>
No I don't have a change of heart
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#125:2:A>
I don't have a change of heart and I mentioned it again to uh Dr
 <@> Mendoza </@> <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#126:2:A>
So but that 's alright <,> I wish uh you could all sign it <{> <[>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#127:2:B>
<[> We have </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#128:2:B>
It 's really up to you but I judging from what you said you made
it appear that you would be in favor of such a proposal <{> <[> this morning
 </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#129:2:A>
<[> No I hope that </[> </{> I did not <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#130:2:A>
I hope I did not
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#131:2:A>
I said let me see what did I say
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#132:2:A>
I said that I know that there is a move for his uh extension and
that uh whatever might be the case uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#133:2:B>
You are against his extension in other words

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#134:2:A>
I am <,> well I would say I am against the extension of uh it
doesn't have to be to be uh <@> Francisco Mendoza </@> you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#135:2:A>
<{> <[> But uh </[> I I I I 'd like to stand by the uh present
policy of the uh of the uh Faculty Manual

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#136:2:B>
<[> Okay but I think </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#137:2:B>
But it does say in the Manual that on a case to case basis <{> <[> 
 <,> </[> uh people can be extended
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#138:2:B>
So if it were you I think we would do the same thing if it were Dr
Quito we would also do the same thing

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#139:2:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#140:2:A>
No I if it were I don't want any exception

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#141:2:B>
But there have been exceptions

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#142:2:A>
There had been but that was in the past
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#143:2:A>
That was during the uhm Andrew administration

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#144:2:B>
But isn't this age discrimination

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#145:2:A>
Uhm well then that 's a new philosophy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#146:2:B>
No it 's not
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#147:2:B>
<{> <[> It 's not </[> a new philosophy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#148:2:A>
<[> It 's a </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#149:2:A>
It 's just that uh it 's just that I uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#150:2:B>
Well

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#151:2:A>
I feel that there must be some <{> <[> <,> </[> retirement

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#152:2:B>
<[> Would would the </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#153:2:B>
Yeah well <,> it need not be sixty-five

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#154:2:A>
In fact it can be earlier

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#155:2:B>
In fact it could be later too

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#156:2:A>
It could be later

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#157:2:B>
But uh but in the case uh of some faculty members who retired
they 're hired on a part-time basis

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#158:2:A>
Yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#159:2:B>
And they are still considered competent you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#160:2:A>
Yes <,> no problem <{> <[> with that </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#161:2:B>
<[> So then </[> </{> what 's the point

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#162:2:A>
Well the point is that uh if there 's no movement up there
there would be no movement down here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#163:2:B>
Yeah but there is a movement <{> <[> there is a movement </[> 
there is a movement down here <,> and we 're doing it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#164:2:A>
<[> And once </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#165:2:A>
No a movement in the sense that uh up here among among the seniors
there must be movement uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#166:2:B>
But this is just cronyism isn't it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#167:2:B>
We are all intelligent people I think we have a right to say what
we think

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#168:2:A>
Yes of course of course

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#169:2:B>
And I think we we have arguments to support our case

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#170:2:A>
So go ahead
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#171:2:A>
I mean uhm I I wish you the best and I have no I 've nothing
against that <?> your view </?> prosper but uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#172:2:B>
I should hope not but anyway I think uh like I said before I
think it 's a gesture and uh <{> <[> <,> </[> the point is uh when somebody
has retired and then they turn back and re-hire him on a part- time basis to
me it seems like exploitation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#173:2:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#174:2:A>
Well then if uh the person feels it is exploitation then I think
uh the thing to do is not to uh not to teach

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#175:2:B>
Yeah but that 's a very cruel argument <{> <[> <,> </[> 
because some people some people just don't have a choice
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#176:2:B>
When they turn sixty-five uh they don't have many other options
and they 've been loyal to an institution and they 're still capable
especially in an institution of <.> ac </.> academic learning <,> an
institution of intellectuals
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#177:2:B>
The mind is more fertile at that age

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#178:2:A>
<[> No </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#179:2:A>
Yes even even even later

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#180:2:B>
And uh so I mean Kant uh wrote his work on religion when he
was uh way over sixty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#181:2:A>
Right right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#182:2:B>
And so you see for me it 's <,> sometimes uh I just think
that people should state what they think in order to avoid injustice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#183:2:A>
I have no disagreement regarding that that the <unclear> 1
word </unclear> should continue <{> <[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#184:2:B>
<[> The way I see it </[> </{> you know I just see it <,> I
think the way I see it very frankly is I think if there is some kind of
solidarity here then uh <,> I would expect your support

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#185:2:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#186:2:B>
You see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#187:2:B>
'Cause otherwise uh uh the chairman just becomes uh you know he
stands in opposition to the faculty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#188:2:B>
But if the faculty already has expressed its support I think uh a
chairman should be should show his solidarity

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#189:2:A>
That 's not necessarily the case
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#190:2:A>
So I mean I 'm giving you the uh this has always been this has
always been the

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#191:2:B>
Okay well <,> of course it 's your decision and this is not
obligatory
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-080#192:2:B>
But that 's just the way I see it <,> so I just want it <,> to be
out in the open </I>
