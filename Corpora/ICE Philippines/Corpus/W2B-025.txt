SEVERAL plants found only in the Philippines are in danger of
disappearing from this part of the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#4:1>
Human activities like deforestation, trade and excessive extraction
have been blamed for their present status. </p>

<mention> Haribon </mention> is a non-governmental organization
which advocates community-based management and sustainable development to
protect the country 's forests and other natural resources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#8:1>
It said the country has about 12,000 species of plants, with more
than 8,000 flowering plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#9:1>
The rest are ferns, fern allies, mosses, hepatics, liverworts, fungi,
and algae.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#10:1>
Of this total, 3,500 are endemic to the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#11:1>
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR) says
barely six million hectares of the country 's original forests remain.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#12:1>
Of this figure, about 800,000 hectares are considered virgin forests.

&rdquo; </quote> reports Haribon.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#17:1>
But anyone who happens to be in cutting areas in the country will be
frightened and scandalized by the sight of various plants killed and trees
&ldquo; felled. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#18:1>
Most trees destroyed by deforestation belong to a group of plant
species that are now considered endangered, according to the Agroforestry
Seeds Information and Clearing House ( AFSICH). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#19:1>
Endangered plants are divided into three general categories, as
defined in the 1980 IUCN ( International Union for the Conservation of
Nature) Red Data Book Guide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#20:1>
These are the <mention> &ldquo; immediately endangered species
&rdquo; </mention> , the <mention> &ldquo; vulnerable or potentially
threatened species &rdquo; </mention> , and the <mention> &ldquo; rare
species &rdquo; </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#21:1>
Listed in the <mention> &ldquo; immediately endangered species
&rdquo; </mention> ( Category A) are the <indig> <it> malaboo </it> </indig>
and the Philippine teak.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#22:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Their population are critically small and found in
isolated areas in the country that are constantly subject to drastic
environmental fluctuations, &rdquo; </quote> says Dr. Pamela G. Fernandez,
AFSICH coordinator. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#23:1>
The endemic plants commonly listed under the <mention> &ldquo;
vulnerable or potentially threatened species &rdquo; </mention> ( Category B)
are <indig> <it> almaciga </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> alde </it> </indig> ,
<indig> <it> takobtob </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> igem </it> </indig> ,

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#24:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Their populations are steadily being reduced
because of continued destruction of wild stocks for commercial purposes,
&rdquo; </quote> Dr. Fernandez said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#25:1>
The Philippine plants considered <mention> &ldquo; rare species
&rdquo; </mention> ( Category C) are the <indig> <it> mono </it> </indig> ,
<indig> <it> ungang </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> lacaubi </it> </indig> ,
and <indig> <it> katbalonga </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#26:1>
These are &ldquo; rare &rdquo; because <quote> &ldquo; their
populations have a highly restricted distribution or an extremely specialized
habitat, which may represent the last of its kind. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#27:1>
For all these endangered species, AFSICH recommends immediate and
full protection.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#28:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The survival of endangered species depends heavily on
the conservation of their natural habitat, which is quickly disappearing,
&rdquo; </quote> says Dr. Fernandez. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#29:1>
<indig> <it> Almaciga </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> igem </it>
</indig> and <indig> <it> kalantas </it> </indig> are three of the 12 endemic
trees in the Philippines listed by the Convention on International Trade on
Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ( CITES) as facing extinction.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#30:1>
CITES is an international organization aiming to protect
important wildlife species against over exploitation and promote their
aesthetic, scientific, cultural, recreational, and economic values. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#31:1>
The nine other soon-to vanish tree species are <indig> <it>
batikuling </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> dungon </it> </indig> , <indig> <it>
ipil </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> mangkono </it> </indig> , <indig> <it>

Mindoro pine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#32:1>
The DENR cited excessive extraction of the trees as the reason
for their depletion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#33:1>
Take the case of <indig> <it> almaciga </it> </indig> , one of the
most expensive woods in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#34:1>
People cut this tree for its commercial uses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#35:1>
It is made into ruler, engineering equipment, general construction,
panel boards, piano and guitar bodies, packaging dairy, and agricultural
products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#36:1>
The wood of <indig> <it> sangilo </it> </indig> is made into
jewelry boxes and other novelties.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#37:1>
The <indig> <it> supa </it> </indig> , on the other hand, is highly
valued in furniture, cabinet work, flooring, and tool handles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#38:1>
Aside from trees, other endemic plants are also facing the same
problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#39:1>
This is particularly true to the rare ornamental plants. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#40:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Many unscrupulous commercial plant collectors and
some garden fanciers here and abroad, blinded by greed, lust for profit or
sheer personal satisfaction, are not bothered by the delicate existence of
plants they collect from the wild, &rdquo; </quote> Haribon laments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#41:1>
One ornamental plant sought after by collectors is the <indig>
<it> waling-waling </it> </indig> , an orchid that used to abound on the
trunks of <foreign> dipterocarp </foreign> trees in Davao and Cotabato
provinces.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#42:1>
Now, they are very rare in their natural habitats on account of
excessive logging of <foreign> dipterocarp </foreign> trees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#43:1>
In an attempt to save, protect and regulate the trade of the
country 's wild flowers and plants, the government passed Republic Act No.
3983, which <quote> &ldquo; prescribe conditions under which ( wild flowers
and plants) may be collected, kept, sold, exported, and for other purposes.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#44:1>
While the country is moving toward the conservation of its
endemic plants, many environmentalists believe it is too slow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#45:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But with the full support of both the government
and the public we can be optimistic that significant results can be achieved
within the next decade or so, &rdquo; </quote> says Haribon.

the country with heavy rains and flooding in the north, and a drought in the
south. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#57:2>
Meteorologists claimed the abnormal warming of the water
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean has increased the chances of drought in
Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#68:2>
Scientists claim that the oceans, especially the Pacific, exert a
powerful effect on world climate through the sheer mass transport of heat and
the evaporation of water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#69:2>
The water vapor thus produced condenses to form storm clouds,
releasing latent heat into the atmosphere in the process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#70:2>
This provides the atmosphere 's largest single heat source, and
the higher the ocean temperature in a given location, the greater the
production of water vapor, clouds and atmospheric heat.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#71:2>
The climate system 's complex internal linkages, only partly
understood by scientists, determine how the clouds and heat are distributed
around the globe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#72:2>
<foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> starts when, through causes
not well understood by scientists, prevailing easterly winds slacken at the
equator, allowing a broad but subtle wave of warm water from the western
Pacific to flow eastward toward South America. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#73:2>
No one knows precisely when <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign>
first struck.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#74:2>
Historians are dating the phenomenon at least as far back as the
early 1500s, when the Spanish <foreign> <it> conquistadores </it> </foreign>
entered South America amid raging storms.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#75:2>
But there are even records of terrible sweeping through pre-Columbian
communities 400 years before that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#76:2>
Until this century, <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> was
believed to be a South American phenomenon, with no wider ramifications.

In the Philippines, the 1982-83 <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o
</foreign> had a lasting effect on the country 's weather condition.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#95:2>
For instance, the Manila area did not have sufficient rainfall until
1985 hence no considerable flooding occurred during the southwest monsoon
season. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#96:2>
When the normal southwest monsoon rains occurred in 1986, there
was a great havoc caused by the floods in the Manila area and the Laguna Lake
was also full, leading to the flooding of Taguig for some time in 1986 until
the early summer of 1987. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#97:2>
The absence of rain and consequent flooding in Metro Manila in
1982 and onwards led to complacency in the belief that floods would not
occur.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-025#98:2>
Hence, the canals and waterways were clogged with dirt and debris of
