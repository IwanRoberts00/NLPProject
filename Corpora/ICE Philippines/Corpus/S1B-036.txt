<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#1:1:A>
Therefore the new leadership that would uh uh be formally installed come uh July one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#2:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#3:1:A>
Uh we do realize that uh the President-elect uh will have to unite a divided nation nation divided because of the political exercise that we 've just had
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#4:1:A>
Uh then they would have the new leader would have to invoke a new moratorium on dissension particularly if we expect a Congress that may not be uh that may not come from the party of whoever the President will be
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#5:1:A>
So the <,> the new President-elect would be hard-pressed trying to forge unity but we believe that during the first hundred days all sectors would unite and and extend uh its cooperation to the President-elect and uh while we do realize that this will not be an easy task it will be a difficult uh task admittedly the private sector uh will be there uh particularly the P C C I providing its uh support and cooperation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#6:1:A>
And in this regard we have uh taken the initiative of putting together a paper which we have uh entitled <mention> The First One Hundred Days a Blue Print for Setting the Stage for an Economic Takeoff </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#7:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#8:1:A>
Which we are to present to uh the President-elect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#9:1:A>
Here we detail uh specific areas of concern the fact to be addressed during the first one hundred days uh among which if I could just uh share the the broad uh framework of of our proposal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#10:1:A>
One you have the need to address the power issue

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#11:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#12:1:A>
The energy crisis that continues to confront us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#13:1:A>
Uh second uh the need to mobilize investments for domestic and foreign
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#14:1:A>
Third the need to promote exports uh giving it the highest priority
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#15:1:A>
Uh fourth uh fiscal and uh monetary reforms that have already been negotiated by the Aquino government and which should be sustained
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#16:1:A>
Uh and and fifth and very important is the need to maintain peace and order
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#17:1:A>
So these five areas we have uh identified as uh deserving which has been the subject of a consensus incidentally by the business community and here we detail very specific strategies and uh doable uh measures that that can be put to place so that uh the economy could be uh brought to a <unclear> 2 words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#18:1:A>
And here we see uh I guess I think a three or two percent growth in G N P

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#19:1:B>
Okay now may we have some parting words from the secretary uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#20:1:B>
Of course I know that you are at the helm of the P N P operations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#21:1:B>
Anything that you need to say to our televiewers uh Mr Secretary

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#22:1:C>
Oh I think the first thing I would like to uh uh say is <,> to the local officials who have just been through the exercise of campaigning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#23:1:C>
Uh I think that it 's high time that they take a rest <,> and let the process of counting go on as uh this <unclear> 1 word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#24:1:C>
The campaign uh period although the people have uh chosen who they thought of they think ought to be the leaders
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#25:1:C>
<indig> Sana huwag nilang pakialaman ang bilangan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#26:1:C>
And uh just wait for the results of uh what the people feel ought to be the mandate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#27:1:C>
<indig> Ikalawa siguro gusto ko ring i </indig> uh uh to remind our P N P officers and men nationwide <indig> na tayo ay uh binigyan ng responsibilidad ng COMELEC na ating bantayan ang </indig> uh counting uh transportation of documents from precinct to municipality from municipality to capitol and capitol to Manila 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#28:1:C>
<indig> Sana 'yan ay inyong gawin </indig> uh the assigned tasks that we should physically protect the the documents
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#29:1:C>
<indig> Huwag niyong pabayaan 'yan kasi </indig> uh as I said before the first phase has been successful
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#30:1:C>
We now go to the second phase of uh protecting the uh the canvass uh sheets
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#31:1:C>
Keep on doing your work and uh uh I guess the people will be grateful to us uh once they realize that we have done uh a job which they expect us to do in the first place
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#32:1:C>
<indig> At uh ako'y naniniwala na tayo ay nagkakaisa sa direktiba ng ating Pangulong Corazon Aquino na ating pangalagaan ang halalan upang sa ganoong paraan ay masabi natin na ah </indig> the Filipinos have passed a major test in terms of uh political maturity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#33:1:C>
And uh this could be the precedent of uh the next elections that will be held in nineteen ninety-five and nineteen ninety-eight

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#34:1:B>
Yes Sir
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#35:1:B>
Thank you very much Sir
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#36:1:B>
And to you Mr. Pardo we would like to commend you for the uh P C C I for remaining apolitical and non-partisan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#37:1:B>
Your briefly your final words

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#38:1:A>
Well I repeat that uh uh confidence in the political and economic stability of the country must be built uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#39:1:A>
And more importantly unity must be forged now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#40:1:A>
The elections of May eleven is now slowly <.> lea </.> uh leaving us behind
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#41:1:A>
We must move forward get our act together
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#42:1:A>
It would be very important to to uh think and act as one
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#43:1:A>
Both government and private sectors should now forge ahead

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#44:1:B>
Thank you to the two gentlemen for joining us this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#45:1:B>
Ina

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#46:1:D>
Yeah thank you very much too Cathy for joining me this afternoon and in behalf of all the hosts of <mention> Pollwatch ninety-two </mention> we will be back at six thirty to bring you regular programming
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#47:1:D>
Thank you very much for watching and please stand by to find out the initial results of the counting of the ballots <&> break in the recording </&> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#49:1:E>
I would like to venture precisely that the winner will win by a comfortable margin because and this is my very private assessment that uh the majority of those who are undecided and even those who have decided but know that they are for the loser follow the principle <quote> everyone loves a winner </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#50:1:E>
The people I 've heard it said <indig> sayang ang boto ko </indig> <indig> sayang ang boto ko </indig> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#51:1:F>
You think that prevailed

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#52:1:E>
Yeah I think so

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#53:1:F>
You don't think people voted according to their real choices but rather according to the configuration of who was who was leading the pack

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#54:1:E>
Precisely because the choices were very you know were very poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#55:1:E>
<quote> None of the above </quote> was uh the constant
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#56:1:E>
And so I think the main psychological basis for choice will be my vote should count and therefore I will be with the winner 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#57:1:F>
Larry

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#58:1:G>
Uh uh another rare occasion wherein I agree <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#59:1:G>
I would like to add that in a lot of in a lot of uh voters the main the main uh motivation is not to let one candidate win
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#60:1:G>
You see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#61:1:G>
One guy <{> <[> said yeah </[> he says I my my heart is for Salonga uh my guts is against Danding therefore my head says vote Ramos 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#62:1:D>
<[> It 's it 's preventive </[> </{> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#63:1:G>
Many people are like that and uh that 's probably the way it 's going to happen

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#64:1:D>
Uh uhm you agree with that Winnie

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#65:1:H>
I uh uh I agree that perhaps that is the rationale that they they follow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#66:1:H>
I don't agree with that rationale at all because uh if you think that somebody should should be President then you should vote for him

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#67:1:F>
Yeah

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#68:1:H>
No matter what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#69:1:H>
I this concept of winnability makes it all very very makes the whole system all very uh uh prone to being to being influenced by these surveys <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#70:1:G>
One survey another survey <{> <[> will </[> know <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#71:1:D>
<[> Well let let </[> </{> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#72:1:G>
And therefore you are you are substituting

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#73:1:D>
Uh-huh

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#74:1:G>
Your own thinking for the thinking of what you think everybody else is thinking
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#75:1:G>
I I don't like that herd mentality at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#76:1:G>
And I think to the extent that we follow that herd mentality that is to the extent to which we may not be able to vote for the best man or woman

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#77:1:F>
Okay well let me ask you did did you yourself follow that principle

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#78:1:H>
Which principle are we talking about

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#79:1:F>
Voting according to your conscience or voting according to <{> <[> everybody else 's </[> 

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#80:1:H>
<[> Oh absolutely </[> </{> absolutely I always practice what I preach <O> laughter </O> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#81:1:F>
Okay that 's nice to hear
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#82:1:F>
And I think many people out there probably do practice what they preach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#83:1:F>
Or they could have been doing it according to how they were reading the race
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#84:1:F>
We 'll be back with more on this right after this <O> music </O> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#85:1:F>
Okay <indig> nagbabalik po tayo dito napaka- </indig> heated <indig> nitong </indig> discussion <indig> natin </indig> about whether you voted for your conscience or not
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#86:1:D>
And Winnie you 're laughing again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#87:1:D>
What 's up your sleeve this time

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#88:1:H>
Because you know after Larry went through all that spiel I asked him I said what did you do 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#89:1:H>
And he said well I actually voted my conscience 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#90:1:H>
So I said to him well if you did that and I did that what makes us think that the other Filipinos will not do that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#91:1:H>
Uh good <indig> di ba </indig> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#92:1:F>
Yeah

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#93:1:H>
I mean you know in the final analysis I think they are an intelligent electorate

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#94:1:G>
<unclear> words </unclear> is that

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#95:1:H>
I 'm not ready

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#96:1:G>
I know he votes that way

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#97:1:H>
You know who votes that way

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#98:1:G>
The <{> <[> Filipino voter </[> 

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#99:1:H>
<[> Filipino voters </[> </{> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#100:1:G>
As Ernie said they just want to have a candidate that would be the least of all evils <{> <[> as against another </[> one who is more evil in their perception

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#101:1:H>
<[> My golly <indig> naman </indig> </[> </{> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#102:1:G>
My God they have to go out of their way to see to it that he doesn't get to be President

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#103:1:H>
Just let me be the devil 's advocate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#104:1:H>
I mean how can you make that statement

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#105:1:G>
I am not arguing the morality of it

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#106:1:H>
No no no I 'm not I am talking about the historical experience

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#107:1:G>
Uh-huh

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#108:1:H>
I 'm not talking about the morals
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#109:1:H>
Uh if if you remember in nineteen eighty-four everybody thought that uh <w> Marcos' </w> candidates would win in Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#110:1:H>
<indig> Hindi ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#111:1:H>
And yet they voted against <w> Marcos' </w> candidates and Marcos <w> Marcos' </w> candidates did not win only five I think out of the twenty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#112:1:H>
<indig> Hindi ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#113:1:H>
And in nineteen eighty-six everybody all the surveys showed that Marcos would win because the question was who do you think is going to win 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#114:1:H>
So they say well we think Marcos is going to win 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#115:1:H>
However nobody bothered to ask who are you going to vote for 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#116:1:H>
And even if they thought Marcos was going to win here is the case where they said well even if he is going to win I 'm not going to vote for him 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#117:1:F>
Yeah

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#118:1:H>
So I 'm not sure

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#119:1:E>
I think the big difference is that in the case of Marcos it was clearly good versus evil
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#120:1:E>
In the present case all the candidates really have many pretensions that people just could not act on principle <O> laughter </O> that 's just what I think

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#121:1:H>
Oh I 'm not sure about that <&> two speakers speak simultaneously </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#122:1:H>
I believe that among the seven candidates there was no clear choice

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#123:1:F>
There was no clear choice

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#124:1:H>
I cannot believe that

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#125:1:F>
Oh you can't believe that

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#126:1:H>
I cannot believe that

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#127:1:F>
Secretary De Villa without putting you in any uh precarious position here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#128:1:D>
Do you think that the Filipino electorate voted according to this winnability concept or do you think people voted according to their conscience

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#129:1:C>
There are two types of Filipino voters out there <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#130:1:C>
There are those that are influenced by uh by the machine and uh by their <indig> amo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#131:1:C>
Especially in the rural areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#132:1:C>
The old traditional practice of uh of uh some people out there they still ask their uh their their master <{> <[> who they 'll vote </[> for

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#133:1:F>
<[> <indig> Sinong iboboto natin </indig> </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#134:1:C>
<indig> Sinong iboboto natin </indig> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#135:1:D>
<indig> Oho </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#136:1:C>
Then there are also a lot of uh of uh very educated voters in the in the population centers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#137:1:C>
The third factor is there are a lot of young young voters uh who dominate uh uh the the voting power of the country

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#138:1:F>
Uh uhm <{> <[> uh uhm </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#139:1:C>
<[> So </[> </{> when you put all of these together I think that the the the rules uh may somehow not be the same anymore

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#140:1:F>
Do you think this election

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#141:1:H>
The bottom line there is that it 's anybody 's guess <O> laughter </O> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#142:1:F>
Yes do you think this election is <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#143:1:G>
Well I think the bottom line is what is going to happen a few days from now when they actually tote up the votes then we 'll know whether you 're right or I 'm right <O> laughter </O> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#144:1:F>
<indig> Ganon </indig> 

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#145:1:H>
Are you trying to tell me are you trying to tell me that the voters are going to vote for Fidel Ramos because they think that he is the least of the evils
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#146:1:H>
I think there are voters who <{> <[> will vote for him because they think </[> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#147:1:G>
<[> No I didn't say that </[> </{> 

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#148:1:H>
Uh <{> <[> but you 're saying </[> 

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#149:1:G>
<[> I didn't </[> </{> say that

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#150:1:H>
No no no no you 're saying you 're right meaning to say that they they 're going to vote their head rather than their heart or their guts <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#151:1:H>
So what you are what you are saying is that <{> <[> the conclusion is that </[> if if Fidel Ramos wins

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#152:1:G>
<[> I didn't say that </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#153:1:G>
I did say that most voters

 <$H> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-036#154:1:H>
That people are are protesting merely against say Cojuangco or whatever name they 're pitting against 

 </I>
