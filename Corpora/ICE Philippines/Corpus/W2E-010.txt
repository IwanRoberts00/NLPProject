<h> <bold> Still infantile </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#2:1>
<mention> <it> Manila Standard </it> </mention> columnist Emil
Jurado criticized <mention> TODAY </mention> 's editorial for dismissing
<quote> &ldquo; the recent <mention> Women 's Movement to Defend the Peso
</mention> &ldquo; </quote> as <quote> &ldquo; infantile &rdquo; </quote>
and, worse yet, <quote> &ldquo; not only na&iumlaut;ve &rdquo; </quote> but <quote>
&ldquo; sinister. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#3:1>
He may be right, but only that the movement is just na&iumlaut;ve.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#4:1>
Sinister may be imputing too much intelligence to it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#5:1>
Jurado says: <quote> &ldquo; Obviously, the editorial writer
missed the whole point of this movement, which is but symbolical of the need
for the people to unite and do something to defend the peso from dollar
hoarders and speculators. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#6:1>
The aforementioned infantile movement, Jurado goes on, <quote>
&ldquo; simply emphasizes not only concern for the economy but, more
importantly, the need for every sector to unite and do something about it.
&rdquo; </quote> </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#X7:1>
&ldquo; We can't just stand by and do nothing.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#X8:1>
We can't just go on blaming government, the banks that speculate and
trade on the currency, the exporters who hoard their foreign exchange, and
candidates who make political capital of our troubles. &rdquo; </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#9:1>
Why not?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#10:1>
Blaming the government, the banks and the exporters-the real culprits
as Jurado concedes-is better than blaming the innocent: overseas workers,
housewives, ordinary Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#11:1>
And we actually need politicians with the courage to <quote> &ldquo;
make political capital of the country 's troubles. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#12:1>
Maybe then the real culprits will stop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#13:1>
But Jurado insists, <quote> &ldquo; at least here 's a sector of
the country' </quote> - the bejeweled visitors at the <indig> Bangko Sentral
</indig> - <quote> &ldquo; that has taken the initiative to symbolically
exchange their dollars in an effort to burn the fingers of dollar hoarders
and speculators.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#14:1>
It 's a private initiative to prove that, if united, the country will
weather this crisis. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#15:1>
But this is a <foreign> non sequitur </foreign> and begs the
question. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#16:1>
How does a symbolic gesture of converting a fistful of dollars
<quote> &ldquo; burn the fingers of dollar hoarders and speculators &rdquo;
</quote> ?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#17:1>
With shame?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#18:1>
But bankers are <foreign> <it> sin verguenza </it> </foreign> and
impervious to pressure behind the <indig> Bangko Sentral </indig> governor
who jumps smartly to their every whim. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#19:1>
And if this symbolic gesture were actually to work and got many
people to turn in their small dollar holdings, how would that burn anyone 's
fingers?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#20:1>
No way except from the friction of speedily counting out more pesos
to sop up those dollars, as bankers, exporters and Palace officials
converting their loot to a stabler currency will do. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#21:1>
That this infantile gesture might unite more people than the
silly ones who performed it is doubtful.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#22:1>
But if it did, it would beg the question: Why, is unity an answer to
a devaluing currency? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#23:1>
This is precisely the sort of puerile shit our editorial
condemned as racially characteristic and self-defeating.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#24:1>
Every time Filipinos face a big problem, the tendency is to sing
songs of unity.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#25:1>
Does anyone realize that what kills all the sheep is their tendency
to herd together when led to the slaughter? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#26:1>
The point of our editorial is that we have to grow up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#27:1>
Faced with a currency crisis, we must brace ourselves for the
daunting task of finding elusive solutions pertaining to two things about
which nobody has any certain ideas: our present problems and the real state
of our country.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#28:1>
The National Economic and Development Authority lies all the time,
the state university is full of crap, and forget the businessmen.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#29:1>
They lie every morning to their wives.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#30:1>
Why would they hold back with their country? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#31:1>
We need, not to sing, but to understand the situation as it
really is and not as pet theories depict it.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#32:1>
Nobody predicted the crisis, except perhaps this newspaper, which
stoutly dismissed economic trends over the past five years as a
smoke-and-mirrors act.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#33:1>
The UP School of Economics actually clamored for massive devaluation
on the peculiar theory that a cheaper peso will mean a richer country.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#34:1>
The difficulty of finding solutions is compounded in a country that
defies orthodox economics about cheapening currencies to boost exports.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#35:1>
You couldn't give away the crap we produce here except, of course,
children to pedophiles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#36:1>
Nowhere in this situation is unity a solution.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#37:1>
So why push it? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#38:1>
Jurado says that, <quote> &ldquo; unfortunately, there are those
among us who would knock down something good and beneficial.... </quote> <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#X39:1>
<quote> Come to think of it, what have some of our colleagues in [
the] media done to help the country in weathering the crisis? &rdquo; </X>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#40:1>
We don't know about his paper, but this one never let up on its
warning that a progress so rapid as that touted by the administration must be
a sham. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#41:1>
We warned about the volatility of hot money.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#42:1>
When the crisis struck, we laid down the conventional wisdom of
today: Because the Philippine economy had never risen as high as the
administration had bragged-in fact, hardly at all-it wouldn't have as far to
fall as its neighbors.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#43:1>
Indeed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#44:1>
But, as we also predicted, that short drop to the pavement would
crack most skulls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#45:1>
We introduced MIT economist Paul Krugman 's right conclusion, if
wrong reasons, that the Asian economic miracle was only a glitzy Soviet show
that would implode under the growing pressure of outside realities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#46:1>
And we advised that the best way to spend taxes is to defend a
strong currency because, aside from democracy, it is the only other thing we
had of value. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#47:1>
That is what some people in the media did try <it> to avert </it>
the crisis, while other people were licking ass. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#48:2>
<h> <bold> Nationalize the banks </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#49:2>
From Davao-where in recent days a veritable <mention> Who 's Who
</mention> of financial and political leaders has been congregating-comes
news from Paul Dominguez, former presidential assistant for Mindanao and now
private citizen, absolved of all loyalty to the government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#50:2>
Dominguez has corroborated what this newspaper has always said,
and which the bankers and the government have been so hard put to cover up:
the banks are making money hand over fist from the miseries afflicting our
people and our country.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#51:2>
Besides the windfalls they have been getting from our torpedoed
currency-Sen. Raul Roco has fingered them as among the biggest and most
reckless of the dollar speculators-the banks are making big money from the
raising of interest rates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#52:2>
A growing number of families can attest to this state of affairs;
families who, when the economic going was good, were pressed to take loans at
reasonable but far-from-cheap interest rates.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#53:2>
( After all, when did the banks ever charge cheap interest?)

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#54:2>
They now discover that they must pay, on pain of legal suit and
forfeiture, twice the interest for the old loan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#55:2>
This at a time when their ability to pay the old rate is much
impaired, and their ability to pay double the rate is out of the question.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#56:2>
These people are losing their cars and appliances and even their
mortgaged homes.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#57:2>
All victims of some bank bureaucrat 's scribbling <mention> &ldquo;
Repossess &rdquo; </mention> on a form in the quiet of his plush office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#58:2>
Indeed, Dominguez says, rates were already climbing as the peso 's
purchasing power started sinking.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#59:2>
Prime lending rates climbed to 25 percent, up from 20 percent in
August 1997, and 15 percent before the shit hit the fan in July of last year.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#60:2>
But this is a misleading statistic, he says: <quote> &ldquo; As
you all know, this is not the real situation, because we were already being
charged as high as 29 percent. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#61:2>
So the banks have not just been squeezing people hard, they 've been
applying more pressure per square inch than they officially admit to doing.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#62:2>
Instead of sharing the general fate of the country, the banks
have taken advantage of the economic crisis.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#63:2>
Not only to worsen it by hoarding dollars but intensify its
afflictions by raising interest rates on loans that haven't actually lost
much real value.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#64:2>
The struggling middle-class family that took out a loan for a house
and lot before the peso went under might continue paying dutifully the same
loan at the same rate without any loss to the bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#65:2>
But the banks need to cover up for their mistakes, such as big
loans extended to bank directors and special friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#66:2>
Loans for parlous projects soured in the currency 's collapse need to
be covered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#67:2>
But not by the big borrowers with bad loans but by the small
borrower whose good loans must be squeezed more to compensate for the bank 's
big mistakes-or just to satisfy their institutional and time-honored greed.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#68:2>
At a time when salaries are worth less, people find their
obligations to the banks doubling.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#69:2>
Hence, the discreetly handled defaults of big borrowers are now being
paralleled by an increase in the roughly handled defaults of the small ones.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#70:2>
To top it off, the small depositors whose savings in banks
provide the capital for those big loans are earning less interest in real
terms.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#71:2>
While lending rates have skyrocketed, interest rates on deposits
continue at 2 to 3 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#72:2>
For the banks, it seems it is all take, take, take and never any
give.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#73:2>
In the present crisis, bankers continue to laugh all the way to the
bank.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#74:2>
It is as if the banks had a God-given right always to make money and
never to lose any, no matter what the situation for the rest of the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#75:2>
A time-honored principle of human relations is that those who shaft
you should be shafted back.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#76:2>
The banks are not afraid, for they believe in the Imeldific &ldquo;
rule &rdquo; that those who have the gold make the rules.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#77:2>
That 's true, but those who hold the rod can change the rules.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#78:2>
The banks have money but the people have power.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#79:2>
They can tell an administration seeking vindication at the polls to
bring the banks to heel or under state control before they ruin the country
and hurt the people some more.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#80:2>
Nationalization of the banking system should start to be seriously
considered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#81:2>
After all, unlike other commercial ventures that require the
spirit of free enterprise, banking largely springs from the spirit of
freebooters.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#82:2>
Banks don't make anything and don't sell anything.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#83:2>
They take our money and then lend it back to us.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#84:2>
Their ingenuity lies only in making more money out of our money than
is good for the health of us all.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#85:2>
In the past, banking needed one unique quality: integrity.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#86:2>
But that 's all gone now.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#87:2>
Remember that, until Imelda used it as her handbag, the country 's
biggest bank was a government one: the Philippine National Bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#88:2>
Already the government is showing how banking should deal with
the present crisis.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#89:2>
It has ordered government banks to double savings interest rates and
to extend loans at no more than 16 percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#90:2>
It hopes thereby to embarrass the private banks to temper their
rapacity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#91:2>
What for?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#92:2>
Just take them over. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Due credit </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#94:3>
Trust an American to look everywhere but its oldest ally to
shower credit for anything.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#95:3>
Wrote columnist William Safire last Sunday: <quote> &ldquo; The
Japanese call it <foreign> <it> keiretsu </it> </foreign> ; the Koreans say
<foreign> <it> chaebol </it> </foreign> ; the Russian word is <foreign> <it>
semibankirschina </it> </foreign> ; and the Americans label the cozy
arrangement among industrialists, bankers and government officials <mention>
crony capitalism </mention> . &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#96:3>
Safire writes that these varieties of distasteful, often illegal
and invariably wasteful partnerships of government and businessmen <quote>
&ldquo; are lumped together under the American phrase now in heavy vogue:
<mention> crony capitalism </mention> . &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#97:3>
American phrase?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#98:3>
Hardly.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#99:3>
It was Filipinos who invented that term from their original,
especially repellent, and protracted experience of the same: an economy
progressively grabbed and mismanaged by friends and relatives of the thieving
couple Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#100:3>
In tracing the provenance <quote> &ldquo; of this alliterative
gem, &rdquo; </quote> Safire is prepared to credit every possibility but that
it originated in the place that suffered it first, the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#101:3>
He says he first came across it in a 1981 <mention> <it> Time
</it> </mention> magazine article on the Marcoses, but the writer, John
DeMott, disclaimed <quote> &ldquo; coinage, suggesting that it may have come
from a correspondent in the field [ the Philippines] or from an insertion by
his editor at the time, George M. Taber. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#102:3>
Taber didn't remember, but he ventured as how, after all, maybe he
did make it up from hearing the word <mention> &ldquo; crony &rdquo;
</mention> bandied around the editorial room. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#103:3>
We doubt it.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#104:3>
American journalists are too stuck up with rules, too fastidious
about facts and logical connections to come up with so felicitous a phrase to
denote something that wasn't, strictly speaking, <mention> &ldquo; crony
capitalism. &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#105:3>
The better term for what Marcos and his friends did to their
country was <mention> &ldquo; state-sanctioned stealing. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#106:3>
That, too, alliterates.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#107:3>
After all, the Marcos economy was not an unholy alliance between big
money and government-as in Bismarck 's Germany, Meiji Japan and <quote>
&ldquo; the military-industrial complex &rdquo; </quote> of Eisenhower 's
America.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#108:3>
Crony capitalism in the Philippines consisted of Marcos 's poor but
avaricious old school pals.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#109:3>
They were undistinguished by name, property or intellectual gifts,
so he lavished our taxes on his chums so they could pretend to be
capitalists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#110:3>
Parachuting American reporters from the air and Filipino
guerilla journalists underground knew the real story of how people with no
distinction and money were built up from scratch into captains of industry
with our taxes.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#111:3>
Into the national kitty they continued to dip their fingers so they
could go on living high on the hog while their businesses went under. </p>
</I> <&> Extra words below </&>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#112:3>
Where is the capitalism in a cronyism between an Ilocano
politician and destitute classmates like Bobby Benedicto, whom Negrenses
scorned to invite to their table even when he was the dictator 's No. 1
henchman?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#113:3>
Only Filipinos-with that freedom conferred by mastery of a language
not their own-could have invented such a term as <mention> &ldquo; crony
capitalism &rdquo; </mention> for the beauty of its sound and the irony it
contained.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#114:3>
Cronies indeed, but hardly capitalists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#115:3>
This term was bandied around the underground press and on all
social occasions when a crony was out of earshot.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#116:3>
From this propensity to make a joke of everything came the term that
entered the American journalistic vocabulary years ago, but not its
understanding until today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#117:3>
Safire cannot imagine that the term might have been picked up by
an American reporter back here.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#118:3>
Fine, then.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#119:3>
It is an American invention.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#120:3>
But this failure to recognize a Filipino contribution may go deeper
than language.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#121:3>
Because none of those guys out there ever took seriously any
contribution from us natives; that 's probably how they missed the lessons
taught by the 20-year kleptocracy of the Marcoses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#122:3>
One wonders how, after a dozen years since the ouster of Marcos,
Americans are only now realizing the folly of tolerating-nay, more,
extolling-what was just the same old Marcos formula of mammoth stealing in
Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and Japan, giving it such distinguished labels as
<mention> Confucian ethics </mention> and the <mention> East Asian way of
doing business </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#123:3>
Why only now do Americans see the folly of letting armed men
dictate economic policy?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#124:3>
Why did they tolerate crony capitalism in other countries after
seeing what it had done to the Philippines years before? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#125:3>
Perhaps because Suharto and the rest of his Asian gang did the
bidding of their Western friends in other respects.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#126:3>
After the fall of Marcos and the restoration of democracy, the first
order of business of the US State Department with the Aquino administration
was a meeting in Washington, D. C., to discuss the safety of one of the most
notorious, rapacious and culturally pretentious of the Marcos cronies.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#127:3>
A certain Abramovitz took down notes while top State officials
demanded special treatment for the crook. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#128:3>
No wonder it is only now that Americans have discovered crony
capitalism and the harm it can do to a country, and, it seems, to the
financial system of half the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-010#129:3>
But they are too dull to admit where they might have first learned
about it and gotten its name. </p> </I>
