<h> <bold> 'Mobile teachers' project </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#2:1>
<h> <bold> Aim is to reach far-flung areas </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#3:1>
STARTING this year, &ldquo; mobile teachers &rdquo; will be
deployed by the government in far-flung areas to teach the young with the
basics of reading, writing and arithmetic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#4:1>
Education, Culture and Sports Undersecretary Victor Andres Manhit
said they are now recruiting 300 teachers under the <mention> &ldquo; Mobile
Literacy Project &rdquo; </mention> to participate in the program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#5:1>
These teachers are to render 40 hours of service weekly to people
in remote barrios, upland dwellings, indigenous communities and even
rebel-infested areas, Manhit said in a report to Malaca&ntilde;ang. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#6:1>
Initially, he added, the project will cover areas in Palawan and
the Cordillera Administrative Region, particularly Apayao, Ifugao and Abra.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#7:1>
Manhit said beneficiaries of this non-formal education program
will be out-of-school youths aged 15 and above. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#8:1>
Mobile teachers with handy instructional aids will visit Palawan,
CAR and other isolated places to gather clientele and teach them the &ldquo;
basics &rdquo; of reading, writing and computation as well as livelihood
lessons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#9:1>
Manhit said the mobile teachers will hold sessions among residents
even if there are established elementary schools nearby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#10:1>
With the start of this DECS project he said that mountain folks,
indigenous people, OSYs <&> ( = out-of-school youths) </&> and adults need
not travel far to go to schools nor wait for the establishment of schools in
their far-flung communities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#11:1>
Through their roving teachers, the DECS will bring education to
people residing in remote and inaccessible areas in the country, he said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#12:1>
This DECS project is in step, said Manhit, with the commitment of
President Estrada to address the problem of thousands of residents in the
faraway areas who have dropped out of school or have not even attended formal
education due to lack of schools, unstable peace and order condition, and the
need for children to help their parents till their farms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#13:1>
Manhit said the Estrada administration has put a premium on human
resource development because the President believes this is the most potent
way for government to sharpen the country 's competitiveness in the face of
the rising Knowledge or Information Society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#14:1>
Mr. Estrada has also thrown his full support behind a DECS
program to provide pre-school services to indigent kids in depressed
communities so they could be at par, he said, with their rich counterparts
who enjoy a head start by enrolling in kindergarten schools before entering
Grade One. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Estrada firm on graft drive </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#16:2>
PRESIDENT Estrada served notice yesterday that he would pursue to
the hilt this year his campaign promise to rid the government of misfits and
the corrupt. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#17:2>
According to the president, the firing of ranking officials
linked to irregularities last year should serve as a warning to others not to
test his resolve in cleansing the bureaucracy of graft and corruption. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#18:2>
In the first edition of his weekly program <mention> <indig>
&ldquo; Jeep ni Erap: Ang Pasada ng Pangulo, &rdquo; </indig> </mention> Mr.
Estrada said:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#19:2>
<indig> <quote> &ldquo; Hihigpitan natin talaga itong graft and
corruption kaya palagay ko marami na tayong tinanggal na malalaking nasa
puwesto kaya siguro mag-iingat na itong mga ibang ito. </indig> ( We 'll
tighten the screws on graft and corruption this year.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#20:2>
I have removed several high-ranking officials linked to graft, so
this year should serve as a warning to our public servants.) &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#21:2>
The program is aired nationwide over DZMM, the Bureau of
Broadcast Services- <indig> Radyo ng Bayan </indig> , the <indig> Sarimanok
</indig> News Network, and the People 's Television Network Inc. ( PTV-4).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#22:2>
The President pointed out that since he assumed office last year,
he has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate graft and
corruption in any form. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#23:2>
He cited an executive order decreeing all contracts involving
&peso;50 million and above should undergo the approval of the Office of the
President, as one way to check against irregularities in government projects.
</p>

Mayroon akong executive order above &peso;50 million ang bidding
kailangan isasangguni muna sa Office of the President, hindi maaaring
sila-sila lang, kailangan maaprubahan namin. </indig> ( I believe we can do
much against graft and corruption this year.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#26:2>
For instance, I have an executive order which subjects bidding of
contracts above &peso;50 million to a review by my office), &rdquo; </quote>
he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#27:2>
Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, who guested on the program,
said Malaca&ntilde;ang now coordinates more closely with the National Bureau
of Investigation to foil any attempt at forging the President 's signature to
corner multimillion-peso contracts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#28:2>
Diokno said security measures are now in place to thwart such
attempts, as shown by the recent arrest of two forgers who tried to pull off
last year one caper involving a &peso;450 million contract. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#29:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'm telling everybody <indig> hindi gannon

It 's not easy to get through these measures, we have security features that
I cannot divulge), &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#31:2>
Diokno said there were already earlier attempts under previous
administrations to pull off forgeries of the President 's signature, but only
President Estrada acted to stop this illegal activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#32:2>
<quote> &ldquo; In previous administrations, <indig> nagpapalusot

forgery, but they just ignore these.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#34:2>
Only this administration ordered the arrest of those responsible).

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#35:2>
That 's a lesson, &rdquo; </quote> Diokno said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#36:2>
For his part, Angelito Banayo, general manager of the Philippine
Tourism Authority and a presidential assistant on political affairs, said Mr.
Estrada will exercise stronger political will this year in attaining his
administration 's thrusts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#37:2>
Banayo said the President is determined to fulfill his covenant
with the masses because it was the masses who elected him into office in the
last May presidential elections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#38:2>
<quote> <indig> &ldquo; Kaya ang mga programa niya, food

his programs in food, security, agriculture, and peace and order), &rdquo;
</quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#39:2>
Banayo cited the administration 's achievement in stopping
syndicated crimes in its first six months, and in nipping graft and
corruption by firing high-ranking officials involved in irregularities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#45:2>
Even in the peace process and the country 's latest dispute with
China over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, Mr. Estrada showed
decisiveness and astute political leadership, Banayo said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#46:2>
He said this became evident in the President 's action regarding
the Philippines ' territorial dispute with China over the Spratly islands,
and his rejection on the demand of the <indig> Moro </indig> Islamic
Liberation Front on the establishment of a separate Muslim state in Mindanao.

<h> <bold> Erap bares &peso;3 cut in price of refined sugar </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#49:3>
PRESIDENT Estrada ordered yesterday a &peso;3 cut in the selling
price of refined sugar being sold by the National Food Authority ( NFA) to
cushion the impact of rising cost of living due to a series of oil price
increases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#50:3>
In line with the President 's directive, NFA administrator Edno
Joson said retail price of sugar will now be &peso;21 per kilogram to
consumers, compared to the previous price of &peso;24. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#51:3>
The NFA also on orders of the President slashed the retail price
of NFA rice by &peso;2 per kilo beginning Oct. 2.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#52:3>
Each kilo of NFA rice is now retailed at &peso;12.60. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#53:3>
Joson said the low-priced sugar will be available at the Enhanced
Retail Access for the Poor ( ERAP) <indig> sari-sari </indig> stores, <indig>
Tinda </indig> vans or rolling stores, <indig> Palengke ng Bayan </indig> and
other selling outlets such as supermarkets, food chain outlets and
convenience stores nationwide. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#54:3>
To make the cheap sugar accessible to the average consumers,
Joson said the NFA has started re-packing sugar in one or two kg plastic
containers bearing the NFA logo and <indig> &ldquo; Erap para sa Mahirap
&rdquo; </indig> markings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#55:3>
Joson also directed local government units to price their sugar
purchases from the NFA not higher than the specified &peso;21 per kg.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#56:3>
The NFA selling price to LGUs is pegged at &peso;19.50 per kg for
ex-warehouse bags and &peso;20 to those repacked into one or two kg plastic
bags. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#57:3>
<quote> &ldquo; This means considerable budget savings for
consumers affected by the hike in transport cost and other basic commodities
as a consequence of the successive price increases in fuel, &rdquo; </quote>
Joson said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#58:3>
But in the case of government and private institutions such as
hospitals, military establishments, schools and cooperatives, Joson said, the
sale will be at the end consumer price of &peso;21 per kg. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#59:3>
For industrial consumers, the selling price will be at
&peso;19.50 per kg in 50 kg ex-warehouse bags. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#60:3>
Among the industrial users allowed to buy NFA sugar are bakeries,
pharmaceutical companies, food processors and exporters, cottage industries
involved in food processing and soft drinks and ice cream manufacturers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#61:3>
Joson pointed out that as of first week of October, the NFA has
in its possession an inventory of 2.4 million bags of 50 kg refined sugar.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#62:3>
Current sales in NFA refined sugar was recorded at 979,301 kg
with the National Capital Region and Southern Tagalog posting the bulk of
sales at 642,849 kg and 136,404 kg each, respectively. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Speaker urges review of liberalization policies </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#64:4>
WHILE stressing his commitment to the policy of liberalization,
Speaker Manny B. Villar said the country has to <quote> &ldquo; take it slow
&rdquo; </quote> and ensure that ample safety nets are provided to local
industries to ensure their survival. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#65:4>
peaking at the Second International Conference of the
Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co., Villar said he is prepared to call for a
<quote> &ldquo; critical pause &rdquo; </quote> to allow a careful review of
liberalization strategies in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#66:4>
<quote> &ldquo; This policy has profited some while crippling
others who never deserved it, &rdquo; </quote> said Villar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#67:4>
The House of Representatives, he said, has passed a number of
safety net measures to help domestic industries cope with the wave of
liberalization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#68:4>
The Countervailing and Anti-Dumping Duties Acts, which were
passed into law during the 11th Congress, he said, <quote> &ldquo; will be a
big help to local companies &rdquo; </quote> and hopefully will give them
more time to be truly competitive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#69:4>
He pointed out that while he believes in the <quote> &ldquo;
fundamental sense and efficacy &rdquo; </quote> of liberalization, its costs
and benefits to the people have to be carefully assessed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#70:4>
&ldquo; It is still the best way forward to improving our economy
and to integrating ourselves more fully with the world economy at large,
&rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#71:4>
To cushion its negative effects, however, Villar said the House
will continue to work closely with the Executive branch to ensure that local
industries will be able to weather the transition period by instituting the
needed safety nets through legislation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#72:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Our immediate goal is to ensure the survival of
domestic industries and institute measures to encourage their continued
growth and development, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<h> <bold> Validators to check Y2K compliance </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#74:5>
THE Y2K Commission will verify the reports of companies and
government agencies on their Y2K compliance through independent or
third-party corporate validators. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#75:5>
Commission chairman Amable Aguiluz V said the validation process
is meant to make sure computer systems ( hardware and software) in
pre-identified seven critical sectors will function normally on Jan. 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#76:5>
It will also address residual problems, if any are found, by the
validators before the computer problem strikes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#77:5>
The commission has registered a total of nine third-party
validators.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#78:5>
All of them have foreign track records and are either multinationals
or are affiliated with multinationals.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#79:5>
Other interested validators may still be recognized by the
commission. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#80:5>
Once registered, a corporate validator can offer its services to
the 391 companies and government agencies listed by the commission as very
critical in terms of Y2K compliance.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#81:5>
The companies or government agencies will pay the validators. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#82:5>
<quote> &ldquo; Our job here is to make sure all the validators
are competent.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#83:5>
And as an added safeguard, we are requiring them to formally certify
the compliance of their client, &rdquo; </quote> Aguiluz said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#84:5>
Aguiluz said having independent and competent validators is a
must to flush out false reports if any before Jan. 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#85:5>
<quote> &ldquo; By requiring the validators to certify, we are in
effect employing checks and balances in verifying the submitted compliance
reports.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#86:5>
We must be sure about the veracity of these reports so that we can
make last-minute remediation if needed, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#87:5>
The government has also worked out contingency plans in case
unforeseen difficulties arise at the turn of the century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#88:5>
Aguiluz said he is not taking chances with the Y2K problem
because <quote> &ldquo; it is full of uncertainties being a one-time problem.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#89:5>
The banking and financial sector, he said, is the most ready.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#90:5>
Banks have made back-up copies of their records.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#91:5>
The power sector has more than enough capacity that if an outage were
to occur, it would last for only 10 minutes, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-020#92:5>
In all, Aguiluz said he sees only inconvenience and not major
disruptions of business and daily life if the remediation of the critical
sectors proved short of ideal. </p> </I>
