<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#102:1:B>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#103:1:A>
And uh I think it 's one way of expressing myself

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#104:1:B>
Yeah that 's why your masteral 's in relation to that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#105:1:A>
Well yeah sort of but uh you know I really want to pursue a kind of uh further studies in theater arts

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#107:1:B>
Theater arts

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#108:1:A>
And I think that would be

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#109:1:B>
Who 'd be your characters what kind of play by the way is <{> <[> that </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#111:1:A>
<[> Well </[> </{> it 's uh a typical Augustinian presentation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#112:1:B>
Uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#113:1:A>
Well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#114:1:B>
You do that every year

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#115:1:A>
Yeah this is for for three years already for three years

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#117:1:B>
Same play

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#118:1:A>
No different plays of course

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#119:1:B>
Uh different play

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#120:1:A>
Because the the play should suit the characters and at the same time it should really touch a kind of issue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#121:1:A>
It should discuss an issue about for example our issue this year is about friendship and community life

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#122:1:B>
Yeah <{> <[> I 've read it <&> telephone rings </&> </[>

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#158:1:B>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#159:1:B>
Actually I 've noticed that two weeks ago <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#160:1:A>
Yeah well forget the colds
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#161:1:A>
I <.> ju </.> I am very very happy that I am here although I 'm not feeling well
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#162:1:A>
I just wanna see you because uh because yesterday I wasn't able to to join you for lunch

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#163:1:B>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#164:1:B>
Where have you been where were you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#166:1:A>
Yeah I was just very busy doing uh a very important work uh in my room
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#167:1:A>
Then suddenly I slept I rested for a while then when I woke up it 's already three o'clock

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#169:1:B>
You skipped lunch

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#170:1:A>
Yeah it 's time for prayer <{> <[> when I woke up </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#171:1:B>
<[> You always do that </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#172:1:A>
Well sometimes I forget to to take lunch because I 'm too busy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#173:1:A>
But anyway I 'm too fat I 'm big <&> speaker B laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#174:1:A>
And I don't think

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#175:1:B>
No that 's not enough reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#176:1:B>
Your size is not enough reason for you to skip lunch

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#177:1:A>
You know in an Augustinian community we really we really value meal time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#178:1:A>
We should be together we should be eating <{1> <[1> uh together </[1> in the in the refectory
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#181:1:A>
And every time I skip dinner lunch or breakfast my brothers would always ask me where have you been <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> why did you not take your uh your dinner why did you not take your lunch <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> I feel so guilty 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#179:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#182:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#185:1:B>
<[3> And as I </[3> observe </{3> <indig> ha </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#187:1:B>
When you don't join <{> <[> them </[> for lunch

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#188:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#189:1:A>
But sometimes I can't help it but uh just to sleep just to take a rest <indig> kasi </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#190:1:A>
But <.> e </.> every time I do that I ask for an apology especially to my brothers <{> <[> <,> </[> who who kept on asking me about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#193:1:A>
Well that 's part of life 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#191:1:B>
<[> Uh-huh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#194:1:B>
Yeah like when you were when you didn't join us for lunch I when I see you in the afternoon I asked you why didn't you join us for lunch 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#195:1:A>
Well every Friday and Saturday I 'm out for school and they understand that <{1> <[1> I </[1> have <{2> <[2> I have to </[2> take my lunch <{3> <[3> outside </[3> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#196:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#197:1:B>
<[2> I understand </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#198:1:B>
<[3> Outside </[3> </{3> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#199:1:A>
<indig> E </indig> La Salle is too far from San Agustin Center of Studies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#200:1:A>
So uh I take my lunch outside
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#201:1:A>
But Mondays through uh Wednesday I see to it that uh <{> <[> I </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#202:1:B>
<[> You </[> </{> take your lunch here

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#203:1:A>
Well <O> laughter </O> I try I always try but you know my work

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#205:1:B>
Sometimes you fail

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#206:1:A>
Most of the time

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#207:1:B>
And as I observe that as I was saying as I observe when someone is not there for a lunch they look for

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#208:1:A>
That 's because you know it 's part of our training that we should go together we should be together
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#210:1:A>
That 's very Augustinian you know community life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#211:1:A>
We value community life and when somebody is absent of course the fathers always look for the <{> <[> lost sheep </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#212:1:B>
<[> Lost sheep </[> </{> uhm yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#213:1:A>
You know as the Bible says <quote> He 's looking for the lost sheep </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#214:1:A>
And so after that Father Master would always ask the leader oh where is Willy oh where is Dante where where is uh uh so and so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#217:1:A>
So because <&> break in the recording </&> belong to the community
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#219:1:A>
And every time we take our lunch we take our dinner here yeah we talk we discuss anything we discuss issues

<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#224:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#225:1:B>
What did you really want to become when you were a kid

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#226:1:A>
When I was

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#227:1:B>
You wanted to become a priest

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#228:1:A>
Well when I was still in the elementary my one of my teachers asked me what my dream
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#229:1:A>
As I <.> reme </.> as far as I remember I really wanted to be an economist
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#230:1:A>
I don't <{> <[> know why </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#231:1:B>
<[> You love </[> </{> numbers

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#232:1:A>
Not really numbers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#233:1:A>
I don't know why it sounds so good <mention> economist </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#235:1:B>
Uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#236:1:A>
But later on I realized that <,> I cannot really I couldn't be an economist
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#237:1:A>
Then later on during my high school days uh I wanted to be a doctor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#238:1:B>
Uh yeah <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#239:1:A>
But I 'm but I 'm not good in Science

<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#240:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#241:1:A>
Then uh I also hate numbers so I don't wanna be an engineer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#242:1:A>
But later on I realized that I want to teach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#243:1:A>
I want to be with people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#244:1:A>
Then after high school <{> <[> I </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#245:1:B>
<[> What </[> </{> course did you finish by the way

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#246:1:A>
Bachelor of Education I graduated from the Philippine Normal University

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#248:1:B>
<{> <[> Uh that 's good </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#249:1:A>
<[> Then </[> </{> I taught for three years
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#250:1:A>
After before entering the seminary I taught for three years

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#251:1:B>
Where

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#252:1:A>
In Montessori de Manila in Para&ntilde;aque

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#253:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#254:1:A>
Then I really enjoyed teaching
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#255:1:A>
Then it was the time that I met my co-teachers who were seminarians before
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#256:1:A>
Then they invited me for a retreat for seminars symposia about religious life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#257:1:A>
Then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#258:1:B>
Seminarians of Saint Augustine

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#259:1:A>
No uh S V Ds they were my former my former co-teachers in Montessori

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#261:1:B>
Oh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#262:1:A>
Then they left the seminary and then it was the time that they invited me to <{> <[> to join </[> the same congregation 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#263:1:B>
<[> To join </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#265:1:B>
Uh-huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#266:1:A>
Then after that I felt that there was really a calling
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#267:1:A>
Then the rest is history

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#268:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#269:1:A>
It seems that you 're interested about <{> <[> my </[> my my vocation 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#270:1:B>
<[> Yeah I am </[> </{> I am

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#273:1:A>
Well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#274:1:B>
I am interested

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#275:1:A>
It started there uh I felt that uh God is calling me for a very special purpose
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#277:1:A>
Then I enjoyed uh attending seminars about religious life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#278:1:A>
I started reading the Bible and started uh examining myself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#279:1:A>
I involved myself with contemplation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#280:1:A>
Then after that I left my work I asked my superior I wanna enter the seminary then the rest is history as I said

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#282:1:B>
Yeah so you you entered seminary three years after you graduated from college

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#283:1:A>
Yes I worked for three years in Montessori de Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#285:1:A>
It was so compensating I really enjoyed my work
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#287:1:A>
I was able to meet different kinds of people and up to now they still uh we still have an open communication with my former co-teachers and administrators
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#288:1:A>
And <unclear> words </unclear> of me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#289:1:A>
But of course God has greater plans for me

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#290:1:B>
That 's why

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#291:1:A>
Yeah that 's why I opted to be a priest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#292:1:A>
Well it 's not an option but a kind of calling it 's a kind of vocation that I can't really resist

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#294:1:B>
There was one time that you told me you missed kids like

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#295:1:A>
That 's why every time my my formators ask me oh Willy would you like to teach yeah I always see to it that I accept the offer because I really miss kids
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#297:1:A>
One time we were at Bi&ntilde;an

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#298:1:B>
Yeah yeah yeah that <{> <[> was what </[> I was about to say

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#299:1:A>
<[> Uh yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-066#300:1:A>
Every time I see these kids running I miss my work I miss my job as a classroom teacher and I wanna go back 

 </I>
