 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#1:1:A>
Uhm <,> with the permission of the Chief Justice distinguished
Senators we filed our opposition only at about one thirty this afternoon
because truth to tell we could not make out what the President 's counsel
meant when they filed the motion to quash
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#2:1:A>
We felt that they were trying to convert the proceedings into a
criminal proceeding by giving it the title of a motion to quash which is <,> 
in a criminal proceeding
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#3:1:A>
And the Senate rules <,> does not have any provision on a motion to
dismiss or to quash
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#4:1:A>
In for interlocutory motions then there 's rules of Court are <?> 
suppletory </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#5:1:A>
So I made a telephone inquiry to the President of the Senate to ask
him what would happen this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#6:1:A>
And he said you argue the prosecution <.> ar </.> I mean the
prosecution will argue the defense will argue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#7:1:A>
So we took it to to mean that there would be a hearing on this
motion so we prepared and finalized our <.> motio </.> our opposition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#8:1:A>
Mr Chief Justice our law professors have told us over and over again
that the Constitution speaks of <,> separation of powers checks and balances
and coequality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#9:1:A>
That has been instilled in us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#10:1:A>
The President would want us to destroy that delicate balance in
filing this motion to dismiss
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#11:1:A>
What is an impeachment process
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#12:1:A>
We agree that the House has the exclusive power to initiate
impeachment and the Senate has the sole power to try and decide impeachment
cases
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#13:1:A>
So you see immediately the distinction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#14:1:A>
We in the House initiate the Senate decides
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#15:1:A>
So have we initiated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#16:1:A>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#17:1:A>
And <,> if you look closely at the process there 's the magic
number of one-third in both the Senate and in the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#18:1:A>
If we get one-third of the members of the House then that one-third
prevails over the other two-thirds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#19:1:A>
That is the beauty of this one-third
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#20:1:A>
So let me repeat Mr Chief Justice distinguished members of the
Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#21:1:A>
This is an instance where the one-third prevails over the
two-thirds and this is what happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#22:1:A>
And in the case of the Senate one-third plus one can block an
impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#23:1:A>
So here 's the magic number of one-third one-third to initiate
one-third plus one for the Senate to block the impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#24:1:A>
This was placed there for good reason
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#25:1:A>
Now what happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#26:1:A>
The fact of the matter is that when this started this was started
by forty-one members of the House short of the seventy-three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#27:1:A>
I myself was not a signatory to the original uhm impeachment
complaint
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#28:1:A>
In my case I wanted steeped in the principle of due process I
wanted to know whether there was really grounds to impeach the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#29:1:A>
In fact if you look at the eleven-member panel here I think half of
them were not original signatories
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#30:1:A>
Along the way this was referred to the Committee on Justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#31:1:A>
But before the Committee on Justice could hear it <,> seventy-seven
had signed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#32:1:A>
We reached the magic number of seventy-three and under the
Constitution once you have seventy-three that impeachment complaint is
transmitted to the Senate and trial shall start forthwith
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#33:1:A>
No ifs no buts
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#34:1:A>
When one-third of the membership of the House says we want to
impeach the President no one but no one can stop the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#35:1:A>
The one-third speaks for the House and that is exactly what
happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#36:1:A>
But did we follow the rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#37:1:A>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#38:1:A>
There was a committee hearing and in that committee hearing <&> 
talks to other members of panel </&> alright and in that committee hearing
everybody was heard those against impeachment and those pro
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#39:1:A>
But faced with seventy-seven signatures the opposition collapsed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#40:1:A>
Hmh <&> talks to other members of panel </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#41:1:A>
Just can I have just a little moment

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#42:1:B>
What 's the pleasure of uh Atty Arroyo

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#43:1:A>
I just want to read here the Journal because the President 's
counsel have used this as reason

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#44:1:B>
The Journal of

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#45:1:A>
Journal of the House of uh November thirteen where it
reproduces the action taken by the committee
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#46:1:A>
It reads <quote> Likewise upon motion which was unanimously
approved </quote> unanimous <quote> the body resolved to refer to the plenary
for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified
resolutions of endorsement of seventy-seven members of the House filed by
them apparently in line with the essence and spirit of Section three
Subparagraph four of Article eleven of the Constitution of the Philippines
and Section thirteen of the rules of procedure on impeachment proceedings
 </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#47:1:A>
Seventy-seven
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#48:1:A>
The committee had no choice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#49:1:A>
The committee by unanimous vote even against those who were against
impeachment said <quote> refer this to plenary </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#50:1:A>
Now what happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#51:1:A>
Mr Chief Justice on November thirteen the Speaker having had the
report of the committee incidentally Mr Chief Justice and distinguished
members of the Senate this was not a committee report mind you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#52:1:A>
This is a report as we understand it in legislation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#53:1:A>
In legislation we submit a committee report but in impeachment it
is a mere report
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#54:1:A>
We are not guided by the rules on legislation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#55:1:A>
We were guided by the rules on impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#56:1:A>
The House had rules of impeachment in the eighth the ninth the
tenth and the present eleventh Congress
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#57:1:A>
And the reason for that is that impeachment complaints were filed
with the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#58:1:A>
The Senate had no impeachment rules for the simple reason that
nothing ever reached the Senate except this one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#59:1:A>
Now <,> just to give our colleagues in the Senate <,> an idea about
what transpired in the House <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#60:1:A>
When the Speaker said that he is transmitting the impeachment
complaint endorsed by seventy-seven members to the Senate he did so as he
puts it his job was ministerial and peremptory
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#61:1:A>
And that he transmitted it in line with our own provisions which
reads <,> <&> talks to other members of panel </&> our own rules <,> our own
rules says our own rule says Mr Chief Justice <,> that a verified
complaint-resolution of impeachment filed by at least one-third of all the
members of the House shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment and in this
case the verified complaint-resolution shall be endorsed to the Senate in the
same manner as an approved bill of the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#62:1:A>
An approved bill of the Senate or of the House means that there 's
no further thing further action to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#63:1:A>
And what is an approved bill under the rules of the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#64:1:A>
Here is what is an approved bill <quote> Section eighty-six The
Secretary-General without need of an express order shall transmit to the
Senate for its concurrence all bills and joint or concurrent resolutions
approved by the House or the amendments of the House to bills or resolutions
of the Senate as the case may be </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#65:1:A>
The treatment of an impeachment complaint which has been converted
into an Articles of eh eh Impeachment is treated as an approved bill and
being an approved bill no further ceremony is necessary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#66:1:A>
It is administrative in nature and that is exactly what the Senate
did no uh what the House did
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#67:1:A>
Now Mr Chief Justice perhaps the question would be would uh is
asked did we verify this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#68:1:A>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#69:1:A>
Did seventy-seven verify this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#70:1:A>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#71:1:A>
The President 's counsel keeps on repeating and repeating and
repeating a verification under the rules of court as understood by the
Supreme Court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#72:1:A>
Sir we are not bound by the rules of court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#73:1:A>
The House has its own rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#74:1:A>
We only listen and obey our own rules and our own rules has its own
verification and I will read it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#75:1:A>
It says <quote> Section thirteen of the rules of impeachment The
contents of the verification shall be shall be as follows </quote> I quote
 <quote> We after being sworn in accordance with law depose and state that we
are the complainants in the above-entitled complaint-resolution of
impeachment that we have caused the said complaint-resolution to be prepared
and have read the contents thereof and that the allegations therein are true
of our own knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation
of documents and other <.> recor </.> records pertinent thereto </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#76:1:A>
Mr Chief Justice distinguished Senators this is what we did
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#77:1:A>
That is the verification
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#78:1:A>
And that is in accordance with our own rules and nobody can
challenge our own rules not the Senate not the Supreme Court not anyone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#79:1:A>
Now what are these rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#80:1:A>
These rules <,> we have our rules pursuant to the Constitution
because the Constitution says <quote> Section three Subsection eight on
impeachment The Congress shall promulgate its own rules on impeachment to
effectively carry out the purpose of this section </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#81:1:A>
We did just that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#82:1:A>
We have our own rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#83:1:A>
And our own rules say what I have read and that we followed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#84:1:A>
But the President 's counsel tells us we should follow the rules of
court
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#85:1:A>
No Sir we don't
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#86:1:A>
We cannot be bound because insofar as the House is concerned we are
supreme within our own sphere
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#87:1:A>
So what is the next question
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#88:1:A>
On the question of verification and <,> could there be
irregularities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#89:1:A>
Mr Chief Justice distinguished Senators on the day November
thirteen you had your reorganization we had our reorganization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#90:1:A>
Right after the Articles of Impeachment were transmitted to the
Senate we elected the eleven members of the prosecution team and it 's in the
Journal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#91:1:A>
The Journal that President 's counsel have been reading we used it
we will use the same text
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#92:1:A>
Page four of the Journal of November thirteen two thousand <quote> 
Election of House prosecutors On motion of Rep Apostol there being no
objection </quote> there being no objection <quote> the following members
were elected as House prosecutors Representatives Feliciano Belmonte Jr
Sergio A F Apostol Joker P Arroyo Raul M Gonzales Wigberto E Ta&ntilde;edo
Ta&ntilde;ada Oscar S Moreno Oscar S Rodriguez Salacmid F Baterina Roan I
Libarios Antonio Eduardo B Nachura and Clavel A Martinez </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#93:1:A>
They 're all here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#94:1:A>
No one objected to our election
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#95:1:A>
Electing the prosecutors is part of the Constitutional process of
impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#96:1:A>
And that was done
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#97:1:A>
No one and not only that the same Journal relied upon by the
President 's counsel on page five says <quote> Remarks of Rep Teodoro At this
point Rep Gilbert C Teodoro Jr hoped that he had the unanimous concurrence of
the members of the majority on the election of eleven members of the House as
prosecutors at impeachment trial in the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#98:1:A>
Subsequently he stated the majority coalition has no objection
thereto
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#99:1:A>
The the Chair noted the same </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#100:1:A>
Eleven members were elected as part of the continuation of the
impeachment initiation of the impeachment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#101:1:A>
Because under the Constitution the House prosecutes and we have
done it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#102:1:A>
Now Mr Chief Justice <O> clears throat </O> we have demonstrated
at least that every phase have <.> do </.> we have done it the House has done
with meticulous adherence to the Constitution and the rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#103:1:A>
But after the election of the eleven prosecutors what happened
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#104:1:A>
There was a reorganization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#105:1:A>
What <,> with the reorganization a new a new Speaker and a new
majority was formed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#106:1:A>
We asked the question Mr Speaker and for our colleagues in the
Senate who are familiar with this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#107:1:A>
The new majority could have questioned the proceedings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#108:1:A>
They did not
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#109:1:A>
As a matter of fact they sought they agreed they validated
everything made
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#110:1:A>
Number one they <.> ge </.> gave us an appropriations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#111:1:A>
Second the Speaker newly-elected Speaker swore us in
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#112:1:A>
What more does the President 's counsel want
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#113:1:A>
Every action was ratified by the new majority
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#114:1:A>
Imagine swearing us in <,> in plenary in the presence of the
entire House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#115:1:A>
In fact the <.> Pr </.> all the objections of the President must
be addressed to the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#116:1:A>
Any remedy in any defect in the proceedings cannot be cured not in
the Senate not in the Supreme Court it has to be in the House
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#117:1:A>
Because we are supreme in our own uh in our own place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#118:1:A>
But what does the President 's counsel want
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#119:1:A>
Like little babies they want to ask the Supreme Court the Senate
to nullify what the House did
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#120:1:A>
No Sir
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#121:1:A>
Mr Chief Justice we have tried to show that there is really
nothing wrong with what we did and we in the House are jealous of this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#122:1:A>
Out of the seventy-seven has anyone withdrawn his signature
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#123:1:A>
No
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#124:1:A>
In fact we have one hundred and five <,> we have one hundred and
five
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#125:1:A>
Can we say now that the Senate can tell us as the President 's
counsel is <.> tr </.> would would like the Senate to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#126:1:A>
No
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#127:1:A>
We will tell you what to do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#128:1:A>
You nullify
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#129:1:A>
The remedy is in the House if they want to but they cannot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#130:1:A>
In fact they 're now the majority 's now in estoppel they cannot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#131:1:A>
After swearing us in after giving us five million to fund us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-062#132:1:A>
There 's nothing more that they can do </I>
