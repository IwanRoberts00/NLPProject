<X> <&> break in the recording </&> not in favor and five remain with reservations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#2:1:Z> 
After tomorrow they will be given twelve working days to come up with a decision which some of them have already assessed as impossible
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#3:1:Z> 
In the meantime nature seems to be pushing towards an undetermined decision <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#4:1:Z> 
Joining us tonight in our special edition of <mention> Options </mention> on the U S bases are three veteran multi-awarded journalists respected for objective analysis and opinion <O> music </O> </X> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#5:1:A>
The U S military bases issue is like a sputtering fuse with the Senate as a powder keg
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#6:1:A>
We don't know if it 's going to explode or not explode at all

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#7:1:B>
On the U S bases the pro side is basically economic while the anti side is basically political
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#8:1:B>
Now both sides are valid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#9:1:B>
One has to weigh which side has more weight <O> music </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#10:1:C>
The current discussion of probable Senate action on a new Military Bases Agreement presents a picture of a possible collision course between the Senate and most of the rest of the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#11:1:C>
I find it inconceivable that the will of the country should give way to the will of the Senate

 <$Z> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#12:1:Z> <X> Tonight on <mention> <w> Options' </w> </mention> special edition <mention> The Bases What Now </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#13:1:Z> With Teddy Benigno Tony Abaya and Rudy Romero <O> music </O> </X> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#14:1:D>
The new bases treaty now under public debate is officially called <mention> The Treaty of Friendship Cooperation and Security between the Philippines and the United States </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#15:1:D>
It is a wide-ranging pact on a number of fields such as military economic and cultural relations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#16:1:D>
The M B A was agreed upon by the Philippines and the U S in nineteen forty-seven shortly after World War Two
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#17:1:D>
It provided for the use of Clark Air Base Subic Naval Base and smaller military facilities by the Americans for free
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#18:1:D>
The Treaty was originally to be in effect for ninety-nine years 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#19:1:D>
In the middle sixties however the duration of the Treaty was cut to twenty-five years
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#20:1:D>
Later the datelines were also reduced and during the Martial Law years a compensation package was added <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#21:1:D>
By virtue of the redemption of the life of the M B A it will expire next September sixteen and according to the new Constitution no foreign troops and facilities will be allowed in the Philippine territory after that date without a new treaty <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#22:1:D>
Pursuant to the M B A and the Constitutional provisions President Aquino notified the U S government about this time of last year that the Philippine government was terminating the M B A
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#23:1:D>
This signified to the Americans that if they wanted to retain their bases here they will have to seek another treaty as stipulated by the Philippine Constitution <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#24:1:D>
The Americans agreed to a renegotiation of the M B A and formed a panel headed by Richard Armitage
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#25:1:D>
On the part of the Philippines the President appointed Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus to head its panel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#26:1:D>
The first meeting of the two panels produced no results <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#27:1:D>
The Philippines presented demands for a bigger compensation package than that provided in the revised M B A
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#28:1:D>
Armitage responded by insulting <,> stating that he was not prepared to enter into a cash register negotiation and went home
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#29:1:D>
However he left behind a technical staff that continued exploring points of agreement with its Philippine counterpart <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#30:1:D>
The bases talks were resumed middle of this year
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#31:1:D>
This time an agreement was reached but there were still many issues that were unresolved
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#32:1:D>
Last month the Philippine and U S panels announced the negotiations were over and that except for a few minor changes in the draft the Treaty would be initialed soon
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#33:1:D>
The terms announced however met with objections from the Senate which by law must ratify the Treaty before it can go into effect <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#34:1:D>
Even as the negotiations were going on Mount Pinatubo erupted rendering Clark Air Base useless to the Americans who announced they were leaving the base next year
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#35:1:D>
The Treaty that would be sent to the Senate for ratification calls only for the retention of the Subic Naval Base
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#36:1:D>
For its use the U S promises two hundred fifty-three million dollars a year as military assistance but no specific amount for economic aid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#38:1:D>
The treaty only provides economic assistance by the U S in the form of help in getting more loans at concessional terms greater access to American markets of Philippine exports and the like
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#39:1:D>
No money involved
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#40:1:D>
Malaca&ntilde;ang and the U S Embassy have mounted a lobby for its ratification
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#41:1:D>
Some Senators have softened their stand but under the latest version that has been released to the public it might be rejected
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#42:1:D>
Unless of course the U S would offer other benefits for the use of Subic
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#43:1:D>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#46:1:A>
Good evening
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#> Tonight Tony Abaya Rudy Romero and myself will go slam bang on the issue of U S military bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#47:1:A>
Let me start by saying that until very recently I had been pro-bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#48:1:A>
I figured that five to seven years more of the bases would not inflict too deep a wound on Philippine sovereignty
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#49:1:A>
My reason was that the Philippines needed aid and financial assistance very badly
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#50:1:A>
We were bleeding profusely and certainly we could use substantial American payment for the U S bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#51:1:A>
Now <,> substantial rental for me and many Filipinos then was something in the amount of six hundred million to one billion U S dollars
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#52:1:A>
This amount over five years could tide us over
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#53:1:A>
But Mount Pinatubo erupted last June and suddenly I saw the face of an America that shocked me that saddened me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#54:1:A>
The American negotiators led by uh Robert Armitage scaled down our rental demand to two hundred three million dollars
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#55:1:A>
Instead of sympathizing with a country that was badly battered by the Mount Pinatubo eruption they seemingly took advantage of our misery and said two hundred three million dollars take it or leave it <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#56:1:A>
As far as I am concerned I leave it for reasons of national pride self-respect and dignity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#57:1:A>
I don't want us to remain on our knees with a begging bowl in hand resigned to the thought that we cannot exist for the next ten years without the bases without Uncle Sam and without the almighty dollar

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#58:1:B>
Well uh from my point of view I have always been for the bases uh for a maximum of five to seven years and only if the arrangement will be economically beneficial to the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#59:1:B>
Uh I don't believe that the bases were put here to protect the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#60:1:B>
They obviously were put here to protect American and perhaps Japanese interests
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#61:1:B>
And uh as far as compensation is concerned I start with the original Philippine demand of eight hundred uh twenty-five million dollars a year which was broken down into a hard component of four hundred million dollars and a soft component of four hundred twenty-five million dollars a year
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#62:1:B>
Now this compensation demand was based on negotiations for two bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#63:1:B>
Now with the explosion of Mount Pinatubo Clark Air Base has been rendered inoperative so the negotiations were reduced to only one base
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#64:1:B>
So the original Philippine demand of four hundred million dollar hard compensation has been halved and the working figure is two hundred three million dollars a year which is slightly more than the original Philippine demand
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#65:1:B>
Now the soft compensation unfortunately was not inputted into this bases uh agreement but uh according to the <mention> Far Eastern Economic Review </mention> this soft compensation amounts to eight hundred and thirty million dollars which added to the two hundred three cash component comes out to slightly more than one billion dollars a year
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#66:1:B>
I think it is a fair business deal and we should go ahead with it

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#67:1:C>
Outside of the question of the legitimacy of the uh Marcos government and his hold on power during the fourteen period fourteen years period of Martial Law I can think of no issue in this country that has taken us that has been more characterized with characterized by greater passion and emotion during the last forty-five years of our independence than the bases issue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#68:1:C>
This issue has divided uh has resulted in divisions on five fronts
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#69:1:C>
It has divided one branch of the government from another
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#70:1:C>
It has divided the military from the civilians and it certainly tends to it is certainly threatening to
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#71:1:C>
It has divided one half of the legislature from the rest of the citizenry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#72:1:C>
It has divided the Philippines from its principal ally which is now the only superpower in the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#73:1:C>
And it has of late been shown to have divided the business community from a part of the legislature
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#74:1:C>
Certainly this has been a very distracting issue since the uh start of the <,> uh Aquino administration the President 's enunciation of a I 'll-keep-my-options-open stance and the start of the uh discussions what the so-called discussions at the start
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#75:1:C>
On the business front investments have been on hold and major business decisions have been postponed <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#76:1:C>
There has been a tendency there has been a perception that from the very start the focus of the discussions of the bases has been diplomatic and legal and that that of late it has only shifted to the economic
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#77:1:C>
I this is a mistaken perception from my point of view <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#> Given the weakness of our economy the focus of the discussions has always been on the economic
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#78:1:C>
Ratification or rejection by the Senate in the next few weeks would not mean the end of the treaty issue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#79:1:C>
Uh in the forth there 's the forthcoming elections to reckon with nine months from now and the people will perform their own ratification rite when these candidates who vote against both for or against the Treaty will come up for re-election

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#80:1:A>
Okay now that the three of us have jumped into the bases debate I think we should start our slam bang by an inquiry into how these uh military bases in the Philippine really started
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#81:1:A>
And I say that it started because of the cold war that emerged after World War number two

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#82:1:?> Well really Ted uh <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#83:1:A>
Wait wait I 'm just talking about the general treaty on American-Philippine relations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#84:1:A>
I can go back to that also
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#85:1:A>
In nineteen forty-six July four because there was provision for the existence of Philippine bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#86:1:A>
But let me finish my point

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#87:1:?> I 'm sorry

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#88:1:A>
I 'm saying you see that bases as part of the international network of the United States due to the Cold War between communism and democracy started you see very early and John Foster Dulles was the architect of bases all over the world that could as a matter of fact help the mission of rolling back the communist danger
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#89:1:A>
As a result of which bases in the Philippines became very important for American strategy by putting up the United States as the policeman of the globe
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#90:1:A>
That is what how it started

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#91:1:?> The policy of containment

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#92:1:A>
Yes the policy of containment the world over

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#93:1:B>
Let me just add some historical notes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#94:1:B>
The Subic Bay the Subic Naval Base was an originally a Spanish naval base which the Americans took over when they took over the Philippines and Clark Air Base used to be Port <?> Stotsenberg </?> which was set up I believe in the thirties before the second World War
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#95:1:B>
Now the Bases Agreement then started after Philippine independence nineteen forty-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#96:1:B>
That 's true uhm <,> while the Cold War obviously had something to do with it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#97:1:A>
It had everything to do with it everything <&> speakers all talk at the same time </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#98:1:B>
And the opinion now is the uh the Cold War is over
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#99:1:B>
That may be so but <.> temp </.> I would say temporarily <indig> lamang </indig> we don't know what 's going to happen within the next five years
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#100:1:B>
So the the uh the intrusion of the Cold War politics into the Philippine situation I think is still valid up to now whether or not the Cold War is in fact started is uh still extant or not

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#101:1:A>
Come on Tony you know the Cold War is over

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#102:1:B>
It 's over temporarily
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#103:1:B>
It may be temporary you know what happened in we don't know who would have won in the the <&> speakers talk at the same time </&> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#104:1:C>
Communism is crumbling

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#105:1:A>
It is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#106:1:A>
It is like Humpty Dumpty that has split into a million pieces
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#107:1:A>
It has no way of returning back to power and you know that and we know that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#108:1:B>
Uh another historical footnote I was reading the other day as a matter of fact something that uh Mr Vicente Pacis wrote
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-039#109:1:B>
It has something it was his reminiscence Osme&ntilde;a 's reminiscence of something that Quezon said during the last days of the war when he was in exile in the U S and at that time my <.> under </.> my understanding from what I read is that the President the late President indicated that the Americans who were still uh <?> our outgoing masters then </?> that he was amenable to the grant of the continued stay of the bases even after the grant of independence promised in nineteen forty-six
 
 </I>
