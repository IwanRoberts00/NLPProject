1. Discuss the contribution and significance of the ff. writers
and their works to the development of American Literature: a) Walt Whitman,
b) Edgar Allan Poe, c) Robert Frost, d) E. E. Cummings, e) Allen Ginsberg
</p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#2:1>
a) Walt Whitman introduced the use of free verse in a time when
poets were still using the traditional standard set by Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#3:1>
He was the <quote> &ldquo; voice of his people &rdquo; </quote> after
the Civil War.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#4:1>
His poems spoke for the aspirations of the common man, democracy ( his
was the Jeffersonian idealism) and his indictment of the aristocratic way of
living.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#5:1>
Whitman 's use of the personal pronoun <mention> &ldquo; I &rdquo;
</mention> is not restricted to his personal views as a poet, but suggests a
certain &ldquo; oneness &rdquo; or unity with others ( <quote> &ldquo; what I
shall assume you shall assume , &rdquo; </quote> Song of Myself I).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#6:1>
He was also considered ahead of his time by adopting a subject matter
and a theme which has a tone of independence, a strong regard for
individualism, and the popularization of the <foreign> en masse </foreign> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#7:1>
b) Edgar Allan Poe used grotesque and morbid images ( catacombs,
death associated objects) in his work.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#8:1>
Except for some of his poems like <mention> Annabel Lee </mention> ,
Poe dwelled on the dark crevices of the mind--particularly that of ego.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#9:1>
His works opened a new dimension for modernist writers ( in terms of
theme and subject matter) by providing an alternative way in the selection of
materials to write. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#10:1>
c) Robert Frost is one of the Modernist poets who used colloquial
language in his poems.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#11:1>
He preferred simple and ambiguous words in conveying his message.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#12:1>
Unlike the other poets, his topics were not deliberately aimed to
protest or tackle complicated issues.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#13:1>
His <mention> Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening </mention> ,
according to an interview I 've read about him, was just about a traveller
who is travelling on a snowy evening.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#14:1>
He also used a rhyme scheme in the poem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#15:1>
d) E. E. Cummings, another patronizer of the free verse, is a
modernist poet who capitalized on the use of satire in his poems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#16:1>
e) Allen Ginsberg is one of the contemporary poets who uses free
verse and protests as the tone of his poems.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#17:1>
His topics would usually include issues like those of social unrest,
politics and others. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X18:1>
2. Discuss extensively one period in the literary history of
American Literature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X19:1>
Give emphasis on the writers, the subject matter, theme of the works
of that period and the events that contributed to the development of American
Literature. </p> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#20:1>
<h> The Literature of the New World ( 1400-1600) </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#21:1>
The literary works during this period consists of journals,
diaries and autobiographical notes about the explorations made and the
adventures of the people involved in the expeditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#22:1>
Amerigo Vespucci and Christopher Columbus ' accounts, for
example, differ in the way they presented their texts.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#23:1>
Columbus is more specific with scientific details.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#24:1>
His primary purpose was to fulfill and prove his &ldquo; small earth
theory &rdquo; derived from his readings of Ptolemy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#25:1>
He endeavored to reach the West Indies, though he wasn't aware that
he had already discovered &ldquo; America. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#26:1>
His presentation was more objective and theoretical compared to
Vespucci 's which was more subjective ( Vespucci called the natives &ldquo;
uncivilized, &rdquo; barbarians and the like).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#27:1>
Thus, Vespucci 's and Columbus ' work did not really explicitly
attempted to arrive at a more literary text, rather, they were compelled by
the necessity to discover, explore, and later expand the territories of their
motherland. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#28:1>
On the other hand, the coming of Capt. John Smith 's accounts
posed a challenge to the earlier works of Vespucci and Columbus.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#29:1>
His was purely based on experience, and his portrayal of Pocahontas '
people and land was more vivid and descriptive.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#30:1>
Smith also introduced the concept of a new hero by placing himself as
the protagonist of a romantic adventure in the wilderness.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#31:1>
The issue of whether one is civilized or not, was in fact, put aside.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#32:1>
Smith 's account seemed more like &ldquo; selling &rdquo; the land to
the colonizers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#33:1>
He focused on the advantages and things which they can gain from the
natives. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X34:1>
3. Discuss the dilemma/conflict of the modern man as presented
in: A) ____, B) ____, C)____, D)____, E)____. </p> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#35:1>
<h> a) A Clean and Well Lighted Place </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#36:1>
The protagonist in the story is torn in conflict between the
young and old generation, when the ways of the young is now becoming a potent
force in their time, and the old needs to succumb to the changes, but is
stuck with their old ways. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#37:1>
<h> b) Of Mice and Men </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#38:1>
Lenny and George are examples of those who aspire to live a
simple and friendly life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#39:1>
They are one of those few people who value companionship despite the
harsh realities of living - particularly that of getting a job, earning and
saving in the hope of achieving their dream of owning a house, and garden
where they can plant and harvest their own food and a place where they can
raise a few animals and Lenny can raise rabbits.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#40:1>
Once in a awhile, their co-workers would discourage them and persuade
them to give up their dream ( <quote> What they 're trying to achieve is only
an illusion, they 'd forever stay as poor as a mice).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#41:1>
Their strength and trust in each other remains their only shield
against all odds ( Lenny would tell George that they 've always got each
other, and that 's what 's important). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#42:1>
<h> c) Hands </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#43:1>
Mr. Harper is a man who is inherently good, of good moral
disposition but at times is being forced by his own &ldquo; hands &rdquo; (
as if they 've a mind of their own) to commit things he tries desperately to
avoid.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#44:1>
Yet it is evident that although he was being forced by his &ldquo;
hands &rdquo; to do things he don't want to, he managed to &ldquo; tame
&rdquo; them as best as he could by diverting them to some productive and
useful work in the fields. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#45:1>
<h> d) The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#46:1>
The sudden change in the Marshal 's attitude and behavior was due
to his marriage with a girl from another place.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#47:1>
He broke the tradition of informing his people about the marriage,
and became more calm in facing a dilemma ( that of a challenge posed by his
rival).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#48:1>
He no longer carried his cowboy image upon his return, but he seemed
to have surrendered the typical characteristics a more refined man. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#49:1>
<h> e) The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#50:1>
Huck Finn is an example of a <foreign> picaro </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#51:1>
This lad was torn between the issue of being &ldquo; civilized
&rdquo; or not, of which he chose the latter.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#52:1>
He is a boy governed by his common sense, conscience and good nature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#53:1>
In his adventures with the Negro slave Jim, Huck endeavored to help
reunite Jim with his family.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#54:1>
Thus, he recognized the value of equality by treating Jim as an
equal. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X55:1>
4. Discuss the novel/play assigned to you for term paper in
terms of:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X56:1>
a) insights about the different literary periods in American
Literature

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X57:1>
b) your knowledge of the author

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X58:1>
c) what makes it American

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X59:1>
d) your knowledge of what literature is

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X60:1>
e) could it be one of the greatest literary works in American lit.?
</p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#61:1>
It will be unfair to consider that every literary article one
reads is the greatest or one of the greatest literary work in any particular
literature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#62:1>
It is to my opinion that this is quite subjective in the sense that
there will always be the question of the criteria to be considered in judging
a work to determine its greatness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#63:1>
My term paper <mention> The Sound and the Fury </mention> was
written during the Modernist period.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#64:1>
The style adopted by Faulkner is experimental and his use of the
stream of consciousness in presenting the novel gave me a new insight on how
to present a novel in a different perspective.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#65:1>
But there are difficulties that one many encounter in reading the
text - his use of four narrators for every chapter ( the idiot Benjy,
Quentin, Jason, and the author himself) could prove confusing if the reader
will make the futile mistake of ignoring the details.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#66:1>
Furthermore, the text also calls a little background knowledge about
the <foreign> milieu </foreign> and life of the author.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#67:1>
Faulkner is fond of using his native Southern hometown as setting.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#68:1>
He also mentioned Col. Sartoris, whom he patterned after the life of
his great great grandfather Col. Falkner.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#69:1>
His anti-traditional views and the conflict between two philosophical
views - humanism and naturalism, are to some critics reflected in his works.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#70:1>
I must confess that the novel might require a few more sittings
to be able to understand it better.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#71:1>
Nevertheless, I consider the novel an attempt to come up with a
mimetic portrayal of life in the South.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#72:1>
The culture and beliefs practiced, the way each character spoke, and
how the setting was portrayed reflect the way the people in the South lived.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#73:1>
In fact, the author 's raw material for his novel was purely
American, there was almost no mention of foreign influence, but only that of
American living. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X74:1>
5. Discuss the themes and issues discussed in the literary works
of Puritan America and those of Contemporary America. </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#75:1>
The literary works of Puritan America centered on the spiritual
aspects of American life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#76:1>
The Puritans were more concerned about moral reformation,
purification of the soul and the teachings of the bible.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#77:1>
The writings were also heavily influenced by deism and Calvinism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#78:1>
They are didactic and focused on the improvement of the relationship
between God and man.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#79:1>
Examples of these are William Bradford 's <mention> Of Plymouth
Plantation </mention> ( the Pilgrims attempt to create a new Jerusalem apart
from the materialistic utopia propagated by others), and <mention> Sinners in
the Hands of an Angry God </mention> ( where sinners are being encouraged to
repent while there 's still time). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#80:1>
Contemporary American, on the other hand, produced more liberal
literary works.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#81:1>
Writers still continued to experiment in form and style but centered
primarily on politics, social and economic issues and others.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#82:1>
They focused more on how to improve society and the planet and not
much on the moral side. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X83:2>
8. Compare and contrast the characteristics of the literature of
<ul> Colonial America </ul> and that of <ul> Post War America </ul> . </p>
</X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#84:2>
Literature during the Colonial America were written based from
the experiences of the writer, that 's why it was called as the Literature of
experience and sometimes with imagination.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#85:2>
Because writers then were just starting to explore the art of
writing, simple and uncomplicated themes such as family relations, life in
the wilderness, marriage, native Indians, slaving were just presented.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#86:2>
Literary works written then were very simple, but most of the time
they were didactic or sermonizing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#87:2>
While during the Post War America, certain changes took place in the
literature world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#88:2>
The writers then were greatly affected by the wars like, World War I,
and II, Korean and Vietnam war and the Hiroshima bombing that 's why the
themes or subject matter of their works were also changed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#89:2>
Social injustices, liberalism, freedom, equality, war became the most
written themes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#90:2>
Writers also tried to experiment on the different ways of writing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#91:2>
Experimentation on form and style.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#92:2>
Literature during the Post War America were also called as the
<mention> &ldquo; literature of protest &rdquo; </mention> , because writers
then tried to call the attention of the people to present to them the
destructive or hazardous effects of war to mankind. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X93:2>
Discuss the dilemma/conflict of modern man as presented in: a)
____, b) ____, c) ____, d) ____, and e) ____.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#X94:2>
</p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#95:2>
In <mention> &ldquo; A Clean Well-Lighted Place &rdquo;
</mention> the dilemma or conflict encountered by the modern man was the
quest for the <ul> real essence </ul> or <ul> meaning </ul> of life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#96:2>
Here, the young and the old waiter were used to present the
difference on how two men with different situations in life view life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#97:2>
The young waiter sees life in a very &ldquo; hurrying &rdquo; way.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#98:2>
As he hurries to go home to his family, it was described that because
he has something to care for, he sees life in a positive way while the old
waiter who doesn't have a family or anyone to care for sees life as a waste,
that there 's nothing in this life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#99:2>
Seems like man is just living to wait for his death. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#100:2>
In <mention> &ldquo; Hands &rdquo; </mention> the conflict was
about the inability of the &ldquo; man &rdquo; to face the troubles in the
society.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#101:2>
It 's like Man vs. Society, here Mr. Biddlebaum, the teacher, fled
to another place for he failed to seek justice or defend himself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#102:2>
In <mention> &ldquo; Of Mice and Men &rdquo; </mention> the
conflict was about the struggle of the main characters to cope with life, to
seek ways in order to live a better life.

</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#103:2>
In <mention> &ldquo; The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky &rdquo;
</mention> the conflict was about man 's struggle to change his way of life
by forgetting or getting rid of his old ways of living. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-015#104:2>
In <mention> &ldquo; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn &rdquo;
</mention> the conflict here lies in Huck Finn 's refusal to adopt to the
modern way of living such as going to school or getting educated, wearing
slippers or shoes or being civilized. </p> </I>
