Large numbers of women continue to leave the country each year to
work mainly as domestic helpers, nurses, and entertainers in the Middle East,
Hongkong, Singapore, Japan, Italy, Spain, the U.S.A., and Canada.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#4:1>
Constituting almost half of all overseas contract workers ( OCWs),
they contribute significantly to the government 's foreign exchange earnings,
helping ease the balance of payments deficit.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#5:1>
They also alleviate the unemployment pressures in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#6:1>
Former President Corazon Aquino called them the <mention> &ldquo; new
heroes &rdquo; </mention> of the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#7:1>
Although the economic benefits are readily acknowledged both at
the micro and macro-levels, overseas contract migration has had many
attendant problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#8:1>
Systematic research and analyses are uncovering disruptive
socio-psychological consequences on both the migrants themselves and the
families and communities they leave behind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#9:1>
This paper will review studies on the realities and perspectives
on overseas contract migration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#10:1>
It will analyze the impact of women 's migration on families and
communities; and in the light of this dialogue 's theme, reflect on the
challenges these findings posed towards improving the status and quality of
life of Filipino women. </p>

<h> <bold> The Facts about Overseas Migration </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#12:1>
The number of women overseas contract workers has increased
tremendously in recent years.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#13:1>
In 1987, the POEA ( Philippine Overseas Employment Administration)
recorded a total of 382,299 land-based OCWs, 47.2% of whom were women - - or
approximately 180,441.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#14:1>
From 1984 to 1989, an average of 344,513 workers had been deployed,
accounting for a third of workers in the world labor market.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#15:1>
Although a slight decrease occurred during the Gulf crisis, by 1991,
figures had almost doubled - - with 752,700 OCWs reported by the National
Statistics Office.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#16:1>
The increases have been particularly significant among women OCWs.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#17:1>
Women OCWs are mainly based in Asia ( 72%); the rest are in
Europe ( 11%), U.S.A. ( 8%) and other continents ( 9%).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#18:1>
In Asia, Saudi Arabia received the most number of Filipino overseas
workers ( predominantly male) and Singapore ( 6 out of 8 are women OCWs).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#19:1>
They are predominantly engaging in service ( 60%) and in
professional, technical and related professions ( 35%). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#20:1>
In terms of actual numbers, there were 95,352 domestic helpers
recorded in 1991 ( up from 81,000 in 1987) and 45,899 entertainers in Japan.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#21:1>
These official figures do not accurately reveal the number of
workers since these do not include those who leave the country as &ldquo;
tourists &rdquo; but end up working illegally in the countries of
destination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#22:1>
A Scalabrini Center Study ( 1987) estimated that there were roughly
80,000-100,000 illegally deployed workers to 400,000-460,000 registered land
and sea-based OCWs and permanent migrants in the early to mid-1980s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#23:1>
Approximately half a million women leave the country every year,
according to some estimates.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#24:1>
An overwhelming number seek work as domestic helpers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#25:1>
Between 1990-1991, land-based overseas employment grew at 36% (
compared to 13% of sea-based contract migration).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#26:1>
The women who leave were generally young: 66% were in the age group
20-34 years old; median age is 29.6 years.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#27:1>
In comparison, men are slightly older, with a median age of 35.9
years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#28:1>
Geertje Lychlama, in her analysis of the trade in domestic
helpers ( cited in the Philippine Country Report 1992), contextualized this
phenomenon within the global framework of international migration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#29:1>
<X> <quote> &ldquo; Throughout history, people ( men and women)
forced by all kinds of structural changes and due to all kinds of personal
reasons, have been migrating.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#X30:1>
Traditionally, women have always borne the burdens of household
work, and historically, women have been migrating on their own to do
household work on a contract basis in a foreign country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#X31:1>
What is particularly striking, however, about this type of labor
migration in South and Southeast Asia is that <it> it has grown into a big
money-making business in which the state is also involved. &rdquo; </it>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#32:1>
<h> <bold> Perspectives on Migration </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#33:1>
Migration is seen as a mechanism for effecting a greater balance
of population and resources.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#34:1>
Individuals react to forces in the environment which push them from
one area towards another.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#35:1>
Many of these forces are economic in nature - - such as differences
in employment and wage levels.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#36:1>
Migrants are seen as basically rational beings calculating both the
costs and benefits of a potential move.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#37:1>
Through migration, rural-urban and inter-regional imbalances are
ultimately corrected ( del Rosario 1994; A&ntilde;onuevo 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#38:1>
Why do people migrate?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#39:1>
What makes women leave for overseas work despite the reported abuses
and maltreatment of OCWs?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#40:1>
Why do they return after experiencing the loneliness of separation
from home and family?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#41:1>
What is the balance of costs and benefits? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#42:1>
Many studies have been done to answer these and other questions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#43:1>
Two perspectives dominate the literature on migration: the
equilibrium model of labor mobility and the historical-structural theories.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#44:1>
In mobility studies, the focus was on individual migrants, reasons
for migration and the migration experience itself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#45:1>
Historical-structural perspectives, on the other hand, focus on
macro-structural processes that propel population movements, including
<quote> &ldquo; pressures and counterpressures, both internal and external to
the economy &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#46:1>
According to one proponent ( cited by del Rosario 1994): <quote>
&ldquo; The decision of the migrant to leave his region of origin is
completely predetermined by the allocation strategy determining the
allocation of factors ( i.e., the overall strategy of development for a
country or region). &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#47:1>
Unlike equilibrium theorists, historical-structuralists contend
that migration benefits the receiving countries in the long-term ( with some
short-term positive effects for sending countries) and overall uneven
development results between sending and receiving countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#48:1>
Emerging feminist perspectives have criticized both positions for
their neglect and/or disregard of gender-related and non-economic factors in
migration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#49:1>
Apart from gender as a major dimension, the role of the household and
the family in the decision-making process is not given adequate attention.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#50:1>
Moreover, they emphasized that the role of the state in promoting
international migration has not been factored into the analysis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#51:1>
Gibson and Graham ( cited by del Rosario 1994:48) explained the
situation as follows: <O> quotation </O> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#52:1>
In her analysis of the mail-order bride migration of Filipino
women in the 1980s, del Rosario ( 1994) elaborates and develops this
alternative perspective to explain the complexities of migration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#53:1>
Using the multiple-identities analytical framework, she takes the
migrant women <quote> &ldquo; to the center stage as purposive social actors
who are in constant interaction with the wider social, cultural, economic,
political pressures, thereby maintaining that individual issues cannot be
separate from macro pressures &rdquo; </quote> ( 317).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#54:1>
Individual groups and institutions, according to this perspective,
<quote> &ldquo; act according to multiplicative, sometimes conflicting
effects of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, and other important factors
&rdquo; </quote> . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#55:1>
<h> <bold> Consequences of Women 's Migration </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#56:1>
Available literature on the subject ranges from journalistic
accounts and investigative reports, case studies, and government reports, to
systematic surveys and research reviews and analyses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#57:1>
The impacts of migration, whether internal or overseas, are viewed at
the level of individual migrants, households and families, the nation and
region. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#58:1>
<h> <bold> On Individual Migrants </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#59:1>
At the individual level of analysis, studies revealed that OCWs
not only express relative satisfaction with their decision to work abroad but
also continued to renew their contracts despite the hardships experienced.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#60:1>
The economic necessity was often cited as the main reason for seeking
overseas work; i.e., ( 1990-1991) of 3,099 women-applicants for overseas
domestic work underscored this motivation: 67.6% claimed that higher pay
abroad was the principal attraction, as one of five women further deplored
the few job opportunities available in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#61:1>
In most cases, the promise of future gratification mitigates the
discomforts and dissatisfactions of the present.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#62:1>
Within the framework of migration, the psychological future is
clearly built into the structure of the psychological present. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#63:1>
In their study of male OCWs, Arcinas <it> <foreign> et al.
</foreign> </it> ( 1989:72) observed that <quote> &ldquo; when it comes to
items that are in the nature of summing up questions, our migrant worker
respondents seem almost blindly determined to convince others, and maybe more
importantly themselves, that all the sacrifices that went into their Saudi
experience had not been in vain, that the results have, on the whole, been
salutary. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#64:1>
Analyses based on household and community surveys ( Jimenez 1988)
have likewise highlighted the positive impacts of overseas work in terms of
increased incomes for the household/family resulting in higher levels of
living ( indicated by land ownership, housing, possession of household
conveniences, etc.), enhanced status of the worker within his/her family and
community, and personal growth and development for the spouse left behind.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#65:1>
For the woman migrant, studies disclosed the empowering effects
of gainful work.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#66:1>
A higher income earned in the urban vs. rural setting, overseas vs.
in-country employment, confers upon the worker higher status, respect and
decision-making prerogatives. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#67:1>
Pertierra and colleagues ( 1992:90) noted the deferential
treatment given to the migrant by family members.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#68:1>
This seems logical, for after all, they bring in the money, so that
even otherwise conservative parents ( of single migrants) acquiesce to their
daughters ' &ldquo; sexual liaisons. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#69:1>
Returnees coming home for a visit, after a stint in Europe or the
U.S., look and dress better, have fairer skin ( not being <quote> &ldquo;
exposed to the effects of sun and rain as they would have, had they remained
on the farm, helps them preserve their looks better than their village
counterparts &rdquo; </quote> ) and behave in more sophisticated and
urbanized ways.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#70:1>
This, they point out, is true even with domestic helpers in Metro
Manila who <quote> &ldquo; are considered fortunate by their counterparts in
the province &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#71:1>
In fact, these returnees now vie for the coveted town fiesta queen
and candidates from other barrios often <quote> &ldquo; readily concede
defeat &rdquo; </quote> ( Pertierra, 1992). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#72:1>
Another indicator of this improved status is their popularity as
<it> <indig> ninangs </indig> </it> or sponsors in baptisms, weddings, and
other town activities ( Pertierra <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> ,
1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#73:1>
Other analysts have attributed to the Hawaiian dollar pensions of
returning migrants <quote> &ldquo; the resurgence of rituals of status
&rdquo; </quote> in many Ilocos towns ( Griffiths, 1978; Pertierra 1992).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#74:1>
The broadening of horizons has also been demonstrated in studies
on the impact of women 's work.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#75:1>
My own studies of EPZ workers, many of whom were internal migrants,
revealed the workers ' propensity to postpone marriage, and aim for higher
education thereby increasing chances of going abroad to improve their lives (
Guerrero <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> ., 1989). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#76:1>
Pertierra ( 1992:96) observed the following effects on Ilocano
returnees: <X> <quote> &ldquo; They are all praises for the order they
observe in cities abroad.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#X77:1>
Traffic flows freely, streets are clean, and parks are safe places
to meet friends during weekends.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#X78:1>
They admire the efficiency of the police &rdquo; </quote> </X> ,
especially because they perceive that crimes are dealt with irrespective of
one 's social position.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#79:1>
These workers have learned that all citizens and legal residents,
including domestics, have rights and are entitled to medical assistance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#80:1>
Having lived in another country has widened the perspective of
overseas workers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#81:1>
Mrs. Roca, having been exposed to western approaches, expressed her
frustration over the intricate process she had to go through to face her
husband about the separation...

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#82:1>
<X> <quote> Abroad there is no need for so much talk.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#X83:1>
If you want a divorce, then you divorce </quote> </X> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#84:1>
According to the migrants ' own calculation, the benefits
outweigh the costs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#85:1>
The costs of separation from the family and friends, the low status
of domestic service are more than compensated by a higher pay and the
gratification stemming from their fulfillment of family duties and
responsibilities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#86:1>
On the whole, a favorable balance of attainments and expectations are
attained and the migrants feel satisfied.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#87:1>
The anticipation of a better future for one 's children ( i.e., money
will be saved for children 's college education) tends to mitigate the
dissatisfaction with the present. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#88:1>
The Scalabrini Study ( 1987) on <mention> &ldquo; Solo Parents
and Seasonal Orphans &rdquo; </mention> supports this perspective.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#89:1>
Student/youth respondents whose parents were working either overseas
or in other parts of the country generally agreed with attitudinal items such
as:

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#90:1>
- A lowly job overseas with good pay is better than working as a
professional with low salary in the Philippines

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#91:1>
- Working abroad enriches one 's personality

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#92:1>
- A student should choose a course that would qualify him/her for
overseas work

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#93:1>
- One can earn more and save by working abroad </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#94:1>
Although families have been able to cope with these disruptions
in the short-term, the full impact and long-term consequences of solo
parenting or surrogate parenting will only be felt probably by the next
generation of Filipinos.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-015#95:1>
Psychologists have already raised alarm signals over this phenomenon.
