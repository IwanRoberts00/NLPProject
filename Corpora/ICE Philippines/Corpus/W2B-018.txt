<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#4:1>
The Philippine Government 's blueprint for its role in APEC is
finally out, and the only one looking good is the Asia Foundation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#5:1>
The Asia Foundation funded the research and writing that went into
<mention> <it> APEC and Philippines: Catching the Next Wave </it> </mention>
to the tune of &peso;350,000.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#6:1>
The Foundation undoubtedly meant well, but why is a foreign funding
agency underwriting the production of the Philippine government 's basic
strategy towards APEC?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#7:1>
This is a question that is bugging even some participants in the
policy-making process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#8:1>
The reason does not have to do with the Asia Foundation seeking to
influence Philippine policy, says one of those intimately involved in the
enterprise, who refuses to be identified.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#9:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The government should have paid for the research,
&rdquo; </quote> he says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#10:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But its priorities are wrong, government money is
going to the <indig> <it> palabas </it> </indig> and to the security of the
APEC bigwigs rather than to substantive stuff. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#11:1>
Launched at a Department of Foreign Affairs event featuring
President Fidel Ramos two weeks ago, the report was about five months late -
- to the frustration of many people involved in the APEC process.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#12:1>
Even more frustrating to them, the report is said to omit or distort
many views expressed during the National Preparatory Summit for APEC held on
December 10, 1995 the resolution of which were supposed to be the basis of
the policy paper. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#13:1>
But was the policy paper worth waiting for? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#14:1>
<h> <bold> POSITIVE POINTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#15:1>
The answer is that the paper does have its positive points.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#16:1>
Perhaps the most solid essay is the one on <mention> &ldquo; APEC and
Sustainable Development, &rdquo; </mention> which might be described as one
long word of caution about the threat to the environment posed by the sort of
blanket trade liberalization that is the core of APEC.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; With wrong incentives and absent the proper
safeguards," </quote> it warns, <quote> &ldquo; a liberal trade and
investment regime is equally likely to exert pressure to exploit or deplete
resources more rapidly than otherwise. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#18:1>
Unfortunately, the sustainable development chapter is a minority
voice in a book that otherwise celebrates the trade and investment
liberalization that APEC represents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#19:1>
But where is agriculture?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#20:1>
Before the rest of the APEC blueprint is analyzed, it must be noted
that there is something very important missing, and that is the government 's
policy on APEC and agriculture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#21:1>
This is, of course, a serious omission since agricultural
liberalization has been one of the main bones of contention in APEC.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#22:1>
Last year, the Osaka Summit nearly foundered on the insistence by
Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan - - with the informal backing of
Indonesia and Malaysia - - that agriculture be excluded from the APEC
liberalization agenda.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#23:1>
Does the Philippine government back its neighbors?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#24:1>
Or does it back the US position that APEC is a <quote> &ldquo;
GATT-plus arrangement &rdquo; </quote> - - that is, one that will initiate a
faster and more thorough-going liberalization of agriculture than what APEC
countries have committed themselves to under the General Tariffs and Trade (
GATT)? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#25:1>
It might be noted that the US is fairly transparent about the
reasons for its insistence that agricultural liberalization be central to the
APEC agenda: the United States Department of Agriculture estimates that
two-thirds of the global increase anticipated for farm export to the year
2000 will take place in the Asia-Pacific region, and it wants to make sure
that by that time this market, including the Philippines, will absorb some
60% of US agricultural exports, up from the already large 40% it accounts for
currently. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#26:1>
<h> <bold> TECHNOLOGY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#27:1>
The section on Information Technology is great on data but simply
misleading in its conclusions and downright irresponsible in its key
recommendation to strictly enforce intellectual property rights.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#28:1>
To say that strict adherence to and enforcement of &ldquo;
Intellectual Property Rights &rdquo; will result in the more rapid adoption
of information technology ( IT) and in a more competitive IT industry in the
Philippines is simply false. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#29:1>
Strict IPR enforcement will raise the price of software and
computer hardware, much of which is now affordable in the current looser IPR
enforcement regime.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#30:1>
For one thing, tight enforcement will radically raise the costs of
the government 's data and information operations since, as pointed out by,
among others, the United States Trade Representative 's Office report on
trade and intellectual property for 1996, the Philippine government is
currently one of the country 's biggest users of unlicensed software. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#31:1>
Strict IPR enforcement will also act to dampen local innovation
owing to the royalty payments that innovators will have to pay US and
Japanese information giants like Microsoft or IBM for patented technologies
that are the building blocks of advances in software and hardware.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#32:1>
This is not speculation: Korean firms like Samsung and Hyundai have
had their efforts to innovate in integrated circuits blocked by the US firms
Texas Instruments and Intel 's charges of intellectual piracy and demands for
excessive royalties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#33:1>
IPR enforcement is a US agenda, not a Philippine one, and perhaps
one reason it has been smuggled into the Philippine government position is
that Bill Gates 's viceroy to the country, Michael Hard, general manager of
Microsoft Philippines, made an aggressive input into the document.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#34:1>
Another reason is also unstated: the Philippines is coming up for
review by the United States Trade Representative 's Office in October and the
government desperately wants to leave Washington 's &ldquo; watch list
&rdquo; of IPR violators before the APEC Summit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#35:1>
The authors of the volume should just have been more honest and
stated baldly that the reason the government wants tighter IPR enforcement is
that it faces US trade sanctions otherwise, instead of trying to prove the
impossible: that the higher IT cost this would entail would boost to the
spread of IT in the country. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#36:1>
<h> <bold> SMALL BUSINESS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#37:1>
Championing SMEs ( small and medium enterprises) is a popular
stance in ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#38:1>
The report adopts this posture, but it does a great disservice to the
SME sector by prescribing a cure that is likely to worsen its current status.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#39:1>
Opening up to the winds of international competition via trade and
investment liberalization, it says, will work to the benefit of the SMEs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#40:1>
This is hard to believe, since by the paper 's own description,
<quote> &ldquo; Except for a few SMEs at the international best practice
frontier, the overwhelming majority are characterized by low levels of
productivity, stemming primarily from the inadequate supply of complementary
inputs of capital and skilled human resources. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#41:1>
Moreover, entrepreneurial and managerial skills are in short supply,
<quote> &ldquo; causing high death rates among SMEs. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#42:1>
From the experience of other economies, the key to survival of
SMEs is strong state support in the form of judicious protection against
unfair foreign competition and anti-monopoly action against unfair trading
practices by large local firms.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#43:1>
But this is precisely the sort of effective &ldquo; state
intervention &rdquo; that the proponents of trade and investment
liberalization in APEC would like to outlaw.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#44:1>
The report 's recommendations - - providing SMEs training in
business, access to information technology, access to information about
markets, and access to credit - - are tantamount to equipping them with
sling-shots in the rough and tumble world of liberalized regional trade and
investment dominated by aggressive American, Japanese, and NIC conglomerates.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#45:1>
<h> <bold> INVESTMENT EASE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#46:1>
The key recommendation of the paper on investment is despite the
liberalization of the foreign investment code over the last ten years, it
still is not liberal enough to attract foreign investors.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#47:1>
Thus, the Philippine retail trade sector must be opened up to foreign
investors, and negative lists, or lists of industries in which foreign
investors are banned or restricted, must be scrapped.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#48:1>
And further measures must be taken to enhance the security of &ldquo;
foreign land tenure. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#49:1>
The idea is to become the most user friendly foreign investment code
in the Asia-Pacific, to come up with a code that would basically give foreign
investors &ldquo; national treatment, &rdquo; or providing them with equal
rights as domestic investors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#50:1>
Foreign investments has a key role in national development.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#51:1>
The problem with the Philippines ' approach is that it simply is not
true that the best way to attract and manage foreign investors is by giving
them royal treatment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#52:1>
Indeed, a comparative look at our Asian neighbors shows that despite
the fact that they have had more restrictive foreign investment codes than
the Philippines over the last decade, they have nevertheless attracted far
greater amounts of investment than that country.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#53:1>
An examination of Japanese investment patterns, for instance, reveals
that between 1988 and 1993, &dollar;6.0 billion went to Indonesia,
&dollar;5.3 billion into Thailand, &dollar;4.2 billion into Malaysia, and
&dollar;2.2 billion into Taiwan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#54:1>
Even South Korea, which US government sources regularly denounce as
having one of the world 's most restrictive investment codes, if not the most
illiberal one got &dollar;2.1 billion, compared to the Philippines
&dollar;1.1 billion over the same period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#55:1>
The reason foreign investors favor an economy does not lie in the
relative looseness of its foreign investment code relative to others but
elsewhere.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#56:1>
The report tries to prove its case by citing the complaints of
foreign investors, but foreign investors will always find cause to complain,
even if you have already given them the store - - lock, stock, and barrel.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#57:1>
<h> <bold> TRADE LIB </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#58:1>
The core of the blueprint is the section of trade liberalization,
and here the government 's stance is that whether or not our neighbors move
toward trade liberalization, the Philippines must continue inexorably on the
path of the trade reforms, to complete its program of unilateral
liberalization that will bring about a uniform tariff for all goods of five
per cent by 2004.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#59:1>
To use the words of Dr. Jesus Estanislao, the Filipino representative
to the ( now disbanded) Eminent Persons Group, the Philippines must <quote>
&ldquo; bear the burden of APEC leadership by example. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#60:1>
Or as President Ramos puts it, <quote> &ldquo; We must blaze the
trail that others must follow. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#61:1>
Brave words but pure bravado.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#62:1>
If the Philippines ' neighbors like Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Indonesia, and China have been, in contrast to our government, so resistant
to the American prescription of blanket liberalization, there is a reason for
this, and the reason is that state intervention in the area of trade - -
which included both judicious protectionism when it came to the domestic
market and mercantilism ( aggressively subsidizing their exporters) when it
came to international markets - - has been a central reason for their
success.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#63:1>
It is this factor - - the creative role of state intervention in
trade to correct the imperfections of the international market and give one 's
exporters a leg up in international competition - - that the introduction to
the blueprint deliberately overlooks when it ascribes the East Asian
industrialization experience solely to two sources: markets and technology.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#64:1>
These comments should not mislead leaders into thinking we are
against liberalization.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#65:1>
Indeed, one can argue that the Philippine economy needs a good dose
of it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#66:1>
But liberalization should be a <it> tactic </it> of a pragmatic trade
policy rather than an uncritical <it> strategy </it> dictated by doctrinal
belief.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#67:1>
What is especially dangerous about free trade agreements like APEC
and the GATT-WTO is that they lock in place or make irreversible - - under
pain of trade sanctions - - national liberalization programs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#68:1>
They virtually eliminate trade policy as a pragmatic tool of national
government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#69:1>
Visionaries are said to be either geniuses or madmen, and given
the realities of international economic <foreign> real-politik </foreign> and
the indispensability of interventionist trade policy management in the
experience of late industrializers like its neighbors, the RP vision of
&ldquo; leading by example, &rdquo; of &ldquo; going it alone &rdquo; even if
its Asian neighbors do not dance to Washington 's siren song of
liberalization is unlikely to be a stroke of genius. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#70:1>
As one observer once remarked, the difference between Filipino
economists and technocrats and their Asian counterparts is that the Filipinos
imbibe Chicago School free trade theory as academics and try to implement it
when they get into government, whereas other Asian economists might praise
free trade when in the company of the Americans and Australians but, in
practice, they protect their economies like hell. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#71:1>
There is, however, one important APEC actor that will applaud the
sentiments and policy proposals of <mention> &ldquo; APEC: Catching the Next
Wave, &rdquo; </mention> and that is Washington.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-018#72:1>
For the proposals fall right into its game plan of having the Ramos
government, as host of the 1996 Summit, put back on track the US free trade
agenda that was derailed by the Asian countries during the Osaka APEC Summit
last year. </p> </I>
