<h> <bold> Peso gains another 27&centavo; </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#3:1>
THE PESO yesterday rose by about 27 centavos despite the fall of
other currencies, posting a weighted average rate of &peso;32.883 to a dollar
compared to last Friday 's &peso;33.156. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#4:1>
Traders said the peso depreciation could be attributed to the
decision of the <indig> Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas </indig> ( BSP) to
continue intervening in the foreign exchange market. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#5:1>
Bank sources said BSP 's intervention accounted for 60% of the
total transaction of &dollar;172.5 million in yesterday 's trading at the
Philippine Dealing System ( PDS). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#6:1>
With the rise of the peso and with liquidity going back to normal,
officials predicted that interest rates on peso borrowings would drop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#7:1>
However, the cost of the overnight borrowing of banks or interbank
call loan rates ( IBCLR) remained high at 150% from Friday 's 90%, a fact
that officials consider a problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#8:1>
BSP Gov. Gabriel Singson said the BSP would look into this unusual
increase in IBCLR, which remained high despite efforts of the central
monetary authority to bring down interest rates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#9:1>
The governor said the IBCLR should correspondingly drop as T bill
yields decline and the pressure on the peso eases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#10:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't know why these interest rates are still
going up despite the end of the mopping up operations of the BSP, &rdquo;
</quote> Singson said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#11:1>
The central bank 's offer to sell dollars at &peso;32.90 buoyed
the local currency, with banks taking their cue and lowering their earlier
offers of &peso;33 and above for the dollar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#12:1>
At midmorning the peso averaged 32.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#13:1>
However, it finally closed at &peso;32.883.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#14:1>
At one time, it registered a rate of &peso;32.75 to a dollar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#15:1>
Traders said the central bank 's early intervention in the market
was the main reason for the peso 's appreciation, noting that the Malaysian
<foreign> ringgit </foreign> , Indonesian <foreign> rupiah </foreign> and
Thai <foreign> baht </foreign> were all lower against the dollar in morning
trading. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#16:1>
The <foreign> rupiah </foreign> weakened in reaction to a ratings
downgrade on Indonesia by Standard and Poor 's over the weekend.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#17:1>
The <foreign> baht </foreign> was weaker due to corporate demand for
dollars, traders said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#18:1>
Traders said a recent BSP rule barring banks with excess dollars
from tapping its overnight lending facility also helped the peso. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#19:1>
The stronger peso and prospects for lower interest rates also
boosted sentiments on the stock market. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#20:1>
Stocks inched higher in early trading as investors continued to
hunt for bargains among fundamentally sound blue-chip issues, traders said.

<h> <bold> Ramos can't wait, leaves key bills unsigned </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#22:2>
<bold> Manuel Sanchez </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#23:2>
PRESIDENT Ramos yesterday left for a six-day trip abroad
disappointed that the bicameral committee working for the passage of the
Common Legislative Agenda ( CLA) reportedly failed to deliver it to him for
signing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#24:2>
During his luncheon meeting with members of the House last week,
the President had expected at least five bills to be signed before he went on
another trip. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#25:2>
Among the bills which he was supposed to sign were the last
component of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program ( CTRP), the Anti-Squatting
Bill and the Ancestral Domain Act. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#26:2>
Mr. Ramos had even made last-minute changes in his schedule,
hoping the bills would be delivered to him.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#27:2>
He was supposed to leave from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport
( NAIA) but he chose to fly from the Villamor Airbase for his visit to Hong
Kong, Myanmar and Laos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#28:2>
The President also did not read his prepared speech.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#29:2>
However, the Presidential News Desk ( PNA) distributed copies of that
speech to the media. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#30:2>
In his unread speech, Mr. Ramos said his visit to Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region ( SAR) aims to convey three messages:

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#31:2>
* That the Philippine economy remains essentially sturdy--strong and
stable enough to weather the currency storm now battering the entire region.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#32:2>
* That the confidence stems not only from claims by Philippine
officials, but from assessment of facts by no less than the leading
international financial and economic institutions.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#33:2>
* That the Philippines has forged a fresh national consensus on how
to cope with the passing storm - - and to even move beyond it - - by pushing
on with the primary target to attain full economic tigerhood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#34:2>
The President said he will put across those messages to the Sixth
East Asian Summit of the World Economic Forum ( WEF) - - a gathering of
around 150 chiefs of the world 's top corporations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#35:2>
He is also expected to deliver the same messages before the Asia
House of Hong Kong that groups the stewards of Hong Kong-based and mainland
China-based conglomerates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#36:2>
The President said he will invoke that the Philippines is not a
domino - - that by the sheer pressure of other faltering dominos, it may be
slightly shaking temporarily - - but will stay stable, competitive and
attractive because of its sound socio-economic-political fundamentals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#37:2>
Today, the President will meet with Hong Kong Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa to take up the former British colony 's economic and trading
policies.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#38:2>
In this occasion, he will discuss with Chee-hwa the ongoing review of
the labor protection laws by Hong Kong 's Provisional Legislative Council to
ensure that the rights and welfare of some 150,000 overseas Filipino workers
are guaranteed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#39:2>
Fulfilling the country 's regional responsibilities, the
President said that the Philippines, being the chairman of the Asean Standing
Committee and of the Asean Regional Forum ( ARF), should enhance the
fraternal bond by opening opportunities to revitalize the country 's
bilateral ties with Laos and Myanmar, the grouping 's new members. </p> </I>

MILITARY and police authorities are waiting for President Ramos '
&ldquo; green light &rdquo; to attack the <indig> Moro </indig> Islamic
Liberation Front ( MILF), which is set to execute five more criminals on
Friday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#43:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We are waiting for the go-signal from the
President.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#44:3>
We have to observe the cessation of hostilities.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#45:3>
Since this is a political decision, we have to allow the government
panel to resolve this.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#46:3>
This is the order from higher up since the Raja Muda incident,
&rdquo; </quote> Armed Forces Chief Arnulfo Acedera said yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#47:3>
Raja Muda is the main MILF base in Pikit, North Cotabato. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#48:3>
Last Monday, six MILF rebels shot to death two men tied to bamboo
poles outside a public market in Masiu in Lanao del Sur province. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#49:3>
The men, including one Christian, were killed after being
convicted of robbery and murder by the MILF 's Islamic court. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#50:3>
Acedera has sent about 1,000 soldiers to support the Philippine
National Police ( PNP) Regional Command in keeping peace and order in the
region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#51:3>
PNP Director General Recaredo Sarmiento III, however, disclosed
that they could only make an appeal to the MILF to put off the Friday
execution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#52:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Let us not put the law in our own hands, as the
PNP will be acting according to Philippine laws, &rdquo; </quote> Acedera
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#53:3>
He expressed confidence that the MILF would heed the PNP 's
appeal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#54:3>
Sarmiento also has directed Sr. Supt. Franco Calida, director of
the PNP-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM), to coordinate with the
Southern Command of the Armed Forces of the Phils. ( AFP) and ARMM Gov. Nur
Misuari. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#55:3>
Acedera and Sarmiento 's statements came in the wake of Speaker
Jose de Venecia 's claims that the MILF has agreed to stop the public
executions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#56:3>
De Venecia said he talked to Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman
for political affairs, who informed the Speaker that the MILF will stop the
execution of Christians even if they are found guilty by the rebel group 's
<foreign> Shariah </foreign> court. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#57:3>
De Venecia 's statement, however, contradicts that made by Al Hal
Murad, MILF military affairs chief, who said that the carrying out of death
sentences is <quote> &ldquo; non-negotiable. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#58:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We cannot stop this because this is a religious
obligation, &rdquo; </quote> Murad said in a telephone interview with
Associated Press.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#59:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We cannot compromise. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#60:3>
Murad said his group also would use force to stop police from
entering a rebel camp in southern Maguindanao province to arrest rebels who
publicly executed two men last week as he warned of <quote> &ldquo; a
full-blown war" </quote> in Mindanao. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Almonte: FVR never knew of <mention> 'Big Bird' </mention>
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#62:4>
<bold> Eric Garafil and Rey Requejo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#63:4>
PRESIDENT Ramos knew little about <mention> &ldquo; Operation Big
Bird, &rdquo; </mention> the government 's botched effort to retrieve the
hidden wealth of the Marcoses, National Security Adviser Jose Almonte
yesterday told the House good government committee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#64:4>
Almonte said Mr. Ramos only knew of the operation after he
briefed Mr. Ramos that his name had been dragged into the search for the
hidden wealth of the Marcoses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#65:4>
Almonte said President Corazon Aquino issued verbal orders for
him to proceed with <mention> Operation Big Bird </mention> , and had given
him two letters of authorization dated Aug. 9 and Sept. 9, 1986. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#66:4>
<quote> &ldquo; President Ramos, who was then Chief of Staff of
the Armed Forces and my immediate superior, at the outset, did not know about
it, &rdquo; </quote> he testified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#67:4>
Almonte said <quote> &ldquo; I merely told him that the President
( Aquino) wanted me to recover the Marcos assets in Switzerland with the help
of Mr. Michael de Guzman and he did not want to know the details, &rdquo;
</quote> saying the present Chief Executive 's not probing into his
explanation <quote> &ldquo; showed the discipline of President Ramos. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#68:4>
Congressman Joker Arroyo, the committee chairman, questioned
Almonte intensively, stressing that it was only in 1989 that the security
chief had <quote> &ldquo; militarized &rdquo; </quote> his project and
christened it <mention> Big Bird </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#69:4>
Referring to the 20% commission reportedly asked by Almonte for
the recovery of the gold, Arroyo said: <quote> &ldquo; What Mr. Almonte could
not get during the Aquino administration, he could thus get 100% under the
Ramos government. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#70:4>
The Senate blue ribbon committee continued its own inquiry into
the Marcos gold, with Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago urging committee chairman
Sen. Franklin Drilon to check reports that at least three Central Bank ( CB)
governors conspired to transfer gold reserves amounting to some &peso;61.2
billion into the Swiss accounts of former President Marcos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#71:4>
Defensor-Santiago said Drilon 's committee <quote> &ldquo; must
immediately subpoena <indig> Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas </indig> ( BSP) Gov.
Gabriel Singson and his predecessor Jaime Laya. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#72:4>
Former Ilocos Norte Rep. Ferdinand &ldquo; Bongbong &rdquo;
Marcos Jr. said he welcomes Laya 's inclusion in the probe but doubted if
investigators will turn up any evidence proving that a Marcos gold hoard
really exists. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#73:5>
<h> <bold> Solon presses for ouster of top NEA officials </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#74:5>
A <indig> LAKAS </indig> congressman yesterday pressed for the
ouster of the administrator of the National Electrification Administration (
NEA) and six officials for graft and corruption resulting from alleged
violations of the Public Bidding Law. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#75:5>
Rep. Antonio Bengson ( <indig> Lakas </indig> , Pangasinan) said
NEA Administrator <@> Prospero Marquez </@> had practically admitted through
published statements that the NEA had totally disregarded Presidential Decree
No. 1594 in the conduct of its public bidding and awarding of contracts for
the &dollar;192-million rural electrification revitalization program which
was funded by the World Bank and Japan 's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
( OECF). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#76:5>
<quote> &ldquo; Administrator <@> Marquez </@> is either ignorant
of the law or just plain stupid to simply brush aside the mandatory legal
requirements in NEA 's bidding and awarding of multi-million peso contracts,
&rdquo; </quote> Bengson said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#77:5>
Bengson said <@> Marquez </@> 's press releases and a letter to
Rep. Mar Roxas of Capiz have very damaging and incontrovertible evidences on
the rigging and manipulation of contracts and other irregularities committed
by the NEA officials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#78:5>
In denying anomalies at the NEA, <@> Marquez </@> said: <quote>
&ldquo; The mandatory requirements under PD 1594 which the NEA allegedly
disregarded were not applicable to the NEA 's procurement function because it
was funded by foreign financial institutions. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#79:5>
<@> Marquez </@> also clarified that <quote> &ldquo; it was not
within NEA 's authority to set a policy on 'lone bidder' situation as the
guidelines were prescribed by foreign lending institutions. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#80:5>
Bengson explained that <@> Marquez </@> willfully violated the
Public Bidding Law when the NEA dispensed with the provisions of public
bidding, evaluation and awarding of contracts under the NEA 's
&dollar;5-billion rural electrification project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#81:5>
He explained that there is conflict between the World Bank and
OECF loan guidelines and PD 1594 which mandates public bidding compulsory for
all government contracts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#82:5>
Bengson said there is no provision in the loan guidelines of the
World Bank and the OECF which specifically dispenses with public bidding.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#83:5>
And, granting that there is a conflict, Bengson said PD 1594
should prevail because it is a policy law and superior to <quote> &ldquo; any
of the so-called escape clauses that <@> Marquez </@> and his NEA henchmen
had contemptuously but erroneously peddled in their public statements.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#84:5>
Additionally, Bengson said, there is no legal excuse to do away
with the mandate of PD 1594 for the following reasons:

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#85:5>
* <@> Marquez </@> and other NEA personnel are government officials.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#86:5>
* All the materials and equipment procured by the NEA will be used in
the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#87:5>
* Public funds will be used to pay off the World Bank and OECF loans.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-016#88:5>
Bengson said: <@> Marquez </@> 's statement on PD 1594 virtually
sinks him deeper into the quagmire of corruption and mismanagement that he
had created at the NEA and also paves the way for his expeditious and
ignominious exit from the government service. </p> </I>
