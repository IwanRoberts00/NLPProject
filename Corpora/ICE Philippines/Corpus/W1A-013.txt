3. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC) is a form of economic
integration where free trade is promoted because barriers to trade are
removed among member countries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#2:1>
Argument that although it would increase trade, the problem of income
inequality among nationals of the different member countries will arise is
false.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#3:1>
Assuming that Heckscher-Ohlin model is used where it states that a
country would export the commodity that intensively uses the relative
abundant factors and imports the commodity that uses intensively the
relatively scarce factor of production.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#4:1>
The developed countries which are members of APEC are assumed to be
the capital abundant country and therefore exports capital-intensive goods
while developing countries are the labor-abundant and exports the
labor-intensive good. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#5:1>
Using Heckscher-Ohlin as a take-off point, labor-abundant
countries would concentrate on the production of the labor-intensive good,
there will be an increase in demand for labor.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#6:1>
This increase in demand causes labor to become expensive therefore
wages of labor increase, W/r or wage-rent ratio increases and K-L ratio
decreases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#7:1>
On the other hand k-abundant countries would concentrate on the
production of the k-intensive good and there will be an increased demand for
capital.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#8:1>
Capital becomes expensive and the W/r ratio decreases and the K-L
ratio increases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#9:1>
The increase in the W/r in the labor-abundant country is met by
the decrease in the W/r ratio in the k-abundant country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#10:1>
These increases and decreases would stop until the factor prices
equalize and therefore there is no question of income inequality because of
free trade.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#11:1>
Incomes of labor-owners increases faster and capital owners ' income
also rises. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#12:2>
1. The advantages are: ( a) it is regular, meaning there is never
or almost never a dearth in trade in services bec. there are always travel &
transport receipts and interest income generated from royalties, dividends,
<foreign> etc. </foreign> , and overseas remittances; ( b) it is predictable,
<foreign> e.g. </foreign> overseas remittances are highest in the months of
Nov. - Jan. and travel receipts are also periodic, so that one can estimate
the BOP inflow from this type of trade; ( c) it may imply the level of
attractiveness of economic and social prospects in the country, tourism
promotion is effective or not, ( d) and it may also imply the income
generated by the surplus labor ( as in the case of the Phils. <&>
=Philippines </&> ) ; ( e) it may reflect the level of factor abundance in
labor, as evidenced by OCW remittances.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#13:2>
The disadvantages are: ( a) it is intangible, therefore it is more
difficult to aggregate all the volume of trade in services and it may be open
to procedural errors in calculating; ( b) it does not encourage merchandise
trade and export-promoting activities because it ignores the receipts earned
on exports; ( c) it encourages labor exports that may lead to exploitation of
them; ( d) it is not sustainable because it relies on tourism and labor
prospects abroad that varies accdg. to the economic conditions of the
labor-importing countries; ( e) it is not conducive to growth within the
economy bec. it does not promote efficiency within the export sector by
enhancing the competitiveness and increasing value-added in domestic
production. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#14:2>
a.) If the exchange rate appreciates, the volume of inflows in
terms of the currency of the labor-exporting/tourist-promoting country will
decrease.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#15:2>
If the ER depreciates, the volume will increase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#16:2>
b.) If there is perfect K mobility then there will be easier
access to money, money conversion will be more efficient and quicker, the
volume of inflows will increase bec. tourist receipts and labor remittances
will benefit from less bureaucracy and process payments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#17:2>
c.) If the level of world production increases, therefore BOP
inflows involving trade in services will also experience an increase bec.
labor will be more demanded, and therefore will earn more, translates to
higher new remittances.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#18:2>
Tourist receipts will also increase bec. of higher incomes of
tourists. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#19:3>
The Samuelson theory of factor-price equalization is made under
the assumption that there are two countries ( A and B) involved in the trade,
and that they export the good ( either X or Y) which they have comparative
advantage in.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#20:3>
This comparative advantage is determined by the factor abundance in
each country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#21:3>
The abundant factor is to be used intensively and the good which uses
the abundant factor would be exported.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#22:3>
It 's further assumed that countries A and B have different factor
abundances and intensities.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#23:3>
Both countries will import the good <unclear> one word </unclear>
uses his scarce resources intensively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#24:3>
This theory of factor price equalization states that the prices
of the factors of production will equalize because of trade between two
countries and that the incomes of the owners of the factor of production
intensively used would increase faster than the incomes of the owners of the
factor of <unclear> two words </unclear> intensively used.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#25:3>
To explain the answer clearly, let me use the example of country A
and B.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#26:3>
Country A exports X, a labor-intensive good, and imports Y, a capital
intensive good.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#27:3>
On the other hand, country B exports Y ( K-intensive) and imports X (
L- intensive).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#28:3>
Country B 's demand for X would increase W/r in country A because
labor becomes more expensive.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#29:3>
The same thing happens in country B, the price of the abundant factor
K increases because of the demand from country A.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#30:3>
Hence, factor prices in both countries equalize. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#31:3>
According to the theory, the incomes of the owners of the
intensively used factor will rise at a faster rate than the owners of the
other factor.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#32:3>
There won't be income inequality <ul> if </ul> the prices of the
factors are not discounted.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#33:3>
The Philippines is a labor abundant country, so expecting
labor-intensive goods would increase the incomes of the landless parties.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#34:3>
This would promote better income distribution.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#35:3>
The benefits a country would enjoy under the APEC would thus depend
on different domestic economic policies.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#36:3>
So, under Samuelson 's assumptions and arguments, I believe that the
APEC would help solve the problem of income inequality.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#37:3>
But to fully solve the problem entails changes in the country 's
political and social structures as well as improvements in the government.

3) The Philippines which is a developing country aims to become a
newly-industrialized country by the year 2000.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#39:4>
It plans in doing this by implementing numerous policies for economic
development. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#40:4>
The government under the Ramos Administration is trying very hard
to promote and give importance to small and medium scale industries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#41:4>
Because these enterprises are relatively small, they are more easy to
form thus capital needed to fund these firms will be minimal compared to
large scale industries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#42:4>
The source of funds for these projects will be from both public and
private sectors.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#43:4>
Government has instituted policies to give incentives to small and
medium scale enterprises ( SMEs).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#44:4>
One of these incentives is <indig> Kalakalan </indig> 20 which aims
to fund companies which employ 20 or less workers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#45:4>
Another government policy is the <foreign> Magna Carta </foreign> or
RH6977 which seeks to provide funds for starting small-time enterprises.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#46:4>
Government banks like the LAND BANK and Philippine National Bank are
obliged to provide credit to small enterprises which is mandated by law.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#47:4>
Technology plays a vital role in economic development.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#48:4>
Since government is also promoting manufacturing firms because they
produce products or goods which have high value added, technology is
obviously needed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#49:4>
Government is also trying hard to promote export industries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#50:4>
It promotes these industries by giving the exemptions to these firms
so as to entice more businessmen to go into industry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#51:4>
Although the Ramos administration has signalled its intention of
helping industries like manufacturing, export oriented, small and medium
scale, it still needs to do more - - in the field of technology, there is
little available source for firms which need technology.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#52:4>
Government must provide technology and livelihood seminars to
entrepreneurs that will be beneficial to the country as a whole.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#53:4>
Government must promote college courses that provide education to
future scientists so as to improve the state of technology in our country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#54:5>
( 1) A. Factors that influence industries to relocate to other
economies:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#55:5>
( I) Since most industries try to lower its cost to gain higher
profits, it 's important for them to acquire the cheapest capital or labor (
factors of prod' n).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#56:5>
Thus, industries tend to exploit economies that have cheap labor or
capital.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#57:5>
( 2) To further lessen their prod' n cost, industries prefer to
locate to places where lesser restrictions are imposed on them by <unclear>
one word </unclear> eco. meaning, lesser taxes on imported or tech. or raw
materials, and also on their outputs makes eco. attracting to industries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#58:5>
( 3) Adequate provision of infrastructure ( ex. roads, elec., water,
<foreign> etc. </foreign> ) needed for prod' n will encourage industries to
relocate.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#59:5>
( 4) Easy access to a large mkt. ( eco. w/ higher demand) increases
the probability of relocation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#60:5>
( 5) Lesser barriers to enter & exit an eco. influences industries to
relocate. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#61:5>
<h> B. Relationship or factors w/ that of <quote> &ldquo; undesirable
industries &rdquo; </quote> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#62:5>
It is unfortunate that the flexibility & leniency of some
economies with regards to the establishment of industries attract industries
that cause/contribute to social, environmental & economic problems.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#63:5>
It is because of the absence of restrictions ( in terms of policies &
legal procedures) that certain hazardous industries get away with the
exploitation of an eco. abundant resources.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#64:5>
Aside from attaining the eco. goal of attracting industries to
provide more goods, services and employment, eco. also increased its
problems.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#65:5>
For instance, lesser laws regarding the environment means that
industries can just dump their wastes anywhere for there are no sanctions for
their actions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#66:5>
In short, industries are not required to abide by several legal
procedures before they can establish their factories.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#67:5>
As a consequence, people are affected because of the unhealthy
environment brought about by these so-called industries. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#68:5>
<h> C. Policy Menu </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#69:5>
Due to the presence of these negative externalities, prices of output
do not reflect its true value and the output produced is below the
equilibrium level.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#70:5>
Given these conditions, it is necessary for the govt. to impose taxes
to these <quote> &ldquo; undesirable industries &rdquo; </quote> for the
problems it provided the eco.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#71:5>
In addition to this, the eco. should start implementing laws &
policies that will protect the environment and its people, and will hinder
<quote> &ldquo; undesirable industries &rdquo; </quote> from entering the
eco. with regards to the other industries, that are beneficial to the eco.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#72:5>
Subsidies can be given to them to encourage them to expand their
operations ( improve their products). </p> </I>


<I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#73:6>
( 2) The developing economies of today are experiencing low
levels of growth.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#74:6>
Growth can be seen or measured in terms of the GNP of that developing
country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#75:6>
Developing countries usually exhibit a common characteristic
among them which are ( 1) low levels of living, ( 2) low productivity, ( 3)
high and rising population rates, ( 4) high and rising unemployment rates,
and ( 5) dependence on International Relations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#76:6>
Harrod-Domar model show us that changes in growth or GNP would
equal the national savings ratio over the capital output ratio.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#77:6>
The national savings ratio is positively related to GNP while the
capital output ratio is inversely related. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#78:6>
I. If the developing country would increase their savings and use
it for investment that would yield good profits, the first condition, low
levels of living would improve.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#79:6>
Brought about by increases in investments which would generate
employment, income can be generated especially if the type of investment is
labor augmenting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#80:6>
II. Low productivity can be improved with increases in
investments, firms can invest in machineries that would produce economies of
scale at lower costs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#81:6>
III. High and rising population rates may not be a problem
anymore because of the need of a higher workforce for the economy ( assuming
that jobs created or investments created are labor generating). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#82:6>
IV. High and rising unemployment rates would decrease because
increases in savings w/c brings higher funds for investment would create
employment in the industry.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#83:6>
Jobs will be created and the unemployed would decrease. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#84:6>
V. Finally, if this developing country can increase its growth
rate, ( bec. of increases in national savings and invested on profit-yielding
activities or projects) the country could now be independent or not rely too
much on international relations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-013#85:6>
The developing country can improve and would be able to sustain its
needs w/ only a little help and not a very substantial help from the
developed countries and international financial institutions. </p> </I>
