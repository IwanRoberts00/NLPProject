<h> <bold> The Contribution of Religious Studies at DLSU to National
Development </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#2:1>
<bold> Jaime Belita, CM </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#3:1>
As the Philippines makes the journey to the new millennium, the
national leadership has three goals clearly in mind: poverty reduction, job
creation, and economic growth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#4:1>
This much publicized <it> <mention> medium-term development plan
</mention> </it> is the centerpiece of the Ramos administration.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#5:1>
To achieve his goals, Ramos invokes &ldquo; synergistic factors
&rdquo; like &ldquo; people 's confidence &rdquo; in his administration and
closer ties with our ASEAN neighbors.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#6:1>
There are other synergistic factors that are intended to help achieve
a holistic development, like the Moral Recovery Program and the Values
Education program of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports ( DECS).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#7:1>
Senator Leticia Ramos Shahani came up with the idea of a <it>
Moral Recovery Program: Building a Nation, Inspiring our People to Action
</it> , institutionalized later by the Ramos administration through DECS.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#8:1>
The Philippine Institute for Alternative Futures designed a workshop
module for facilitators named <it> <mention> Wholeness: A Values
Transformation Program for Moral Recovery </mention> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#9:1>
Shahani 's speeches on the moral recovery have been compiled in a
booklet, <it> Moral Imperatives of National Renewal </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#10:1>
President Ramos, her brother, later gave a directive that encouraged
all sectors of society to give this moral recovery program a good fighting
chance.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#11:1>
Both DECS and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (
DILG) are taking active part in its dissemination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#12:1>
DECS has formulated its own Values Education Program ( DVEP),
initiated by former DECS Secretary, Lourdes Quisumbing, in DECS Order no. 6
s. 1988, addressed to DECS Regional Directors and School Heads, both public
and private.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#13:1>
According to the order, <quote> &ldquo; to participate in social
transformation and nation building &rdquo; </quote> is expected from the
citizenry, but first there has to be <quote> &ldquo; a corresponding
reassessment in the values, the attitudes and the behavior of the people.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#14:1>
The DECS order also states in no uncertain terms that <quote> &ldquo;
the enhancement of social responsibility, initiative and resourcefulness must
be internalized first by those involved in the transformation process
themselves, for transformation should start from the 'actors' themselves.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#15:1>
The government thus admitted the crucial role and participation
of the religious sector in the Moral Recovery Program.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#16:1>
Understood here is religion 's role in national development with its
influence channeled through the Churches.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#17:1>
Shahani 's paper says: <quote> &ldquo; Religious has an important
role in molding our values and it should be a partner of government in this
important undertaking. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#18:1>
One institutionalized response to such an appeal is from the Catholic
Church through the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines ( PCP-II), held
in Manila from January 20 to February 17, 1991. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#19:1>
The Plenary Council implied that for the Church in the
Philippines, national development would have to include <quote> &ldquo;
truths, needing emphasis today for the development of the just life and of
the just society which serves that life; integral development based on human
dignity and solidarity; universal purpose of earthly goods and private
property; social justice and love; peace and active non-violence; love or
preference for the poor; the value of human work; the integrity of creation;
the empowerment of people &rdquo; </quote> ( PCP-II, 291).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#20:1>
The neglect of or lack of one of these will leave national
development with much to be desired. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#21:1>
The consensus of both Church and government on the significant
role of values education for national development is conclusive.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#22:1>
Educational institutions which have both governmental and
ecclesiastical recognition are the best venues for the implementation of such
&ldquo; synergistic &rdquo; enterprise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#23:1>
This leads me to my discussion of the contribution of DLSU to
national development in the last eight years ( 1986-94) and what it can do in
the next seven years ( 1995-2001), as far as the university 's religious
studies and religious education 's programs and policies are concerned.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#24:1>
To say that the Religious Studies Department ( RSD) is making a
direct contribution would be presumptuous; only because religion, Church, and
a Catholic university make an impact on the public in moral and social
matters can we claim an indirect contribution. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#25:1>
<h> 1. <it> The Immediate Past ( 1986-1994) </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#26:1>
What have RSD and the Religious and Values Education Program (
RVEP) done in the last eight years?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#27:1>
I shall discuss the more salient areas: the offering of religious
studies instead of theology, the revision of religion subjects in keeping
with the directives of the National Catechetical Directory of the Philippines
( NCDP, 1985), and the establishment of a Religious and Values Education
degree in the College of Education in 1987. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#28:1>
<h> 1.1. <it> Opting for Religious Studies and not Theology </it>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#29:1>
Theology focuses on the confessional and doctrinal content of the
faith, Religious Studies on the anthropological and the phenomenological.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#30:1>
Religious Studies is inseparable from the Christian faith 's seeking
understanding for a &ldquo; fundamental commitment &rdquo; to the human
person.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#31:1>
Human reason helps in that search.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#32:1>
The university is the institution where that <quote> &ldquo; effort
to reach the most accurate understanding of man and the world finds, as it
were, its most concentrated form &rdquo; </quote> ( Massaux 1980:215).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#33:1>
Values education, which is the heart of education, is made explicit
in the stories, doctrines, and moral norms that constitute the materials of
Religious Studies, covering not only Christianity but other faiths as well.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#34:1>
Hence, the Religious Studies program fits in better with a
pluralistic society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#35:1>
An academic approach to religion which is open to other faiths
helps remove the often divisive role of religion that obstructs national
development.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#36:1>
How is this accomplished?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#37:1>
First of all, the phenomenological approach to religion allows every
faith to be affirmed freely and authentically; secondly, the openness to the
other and the respect for human reason are the ingredients that concoct a
<quote> &ldquo; consensus sufficiently strong enough to prevent differences
from becoming disruptive &rdquo; </quote> ( Massaux 220).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#38:1>
Such atmosphere initiated in the Religious Studies approach is
necessary in a &ldquo; democratic and pluralistic collectivity. &rdquo;
Without sounding superior or self-righteous, we can say this about today 's
typical Catholic theologians: because of their cognizance of human reason and
their avoidance of exclusivistic bible-based theologizing ( associated <it>
<foreign> in extremis </foreign> </it> with fundamentalists), they can easily
dialogue with those who are &ldquo; equally reasonable. &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#39:1>
h> 1.2. <it> Revision of Religion Subjects </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#40:1>
The NCDP influenced the revision of the religion subjects at
DLSU.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#41:1>
Basically, the Directory calls for &ldquo; maturing in Christian
faith &rdquo; in any catechetical, religious, or values education programs of
schools and local Churches.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#42:1>
In the teaching of religion or theology, NCDP considers four areas
for renewal: characteristics, purpose, content, and methodology ( Roche
1992:11-18).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#43:1>
These four areas have multiple components, mostly on the religious,
theological, and ecclesiastical side.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#44:1>
Fortunately, however, it has components as well that touch on
national development, since they deal with social, economic, and cultural
matters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#45:1>
Of direct relevance to national development are the
characteristics of <it> Filipino </it> and <it> social concern and service to
the larger community </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#46:1>
A Filipino religion course means that there is an effort at
inculturated, contextualized education through the offering of courses in
Filipino and regarding Filipino values.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#47:1>
The social concern and service to the larger community are realized
by following the Social Doctrine of the Church and the Acts and Decrees of
PCP-II.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#48:1>
RSD has continually created sections where Filipino is the medium of
instruction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#49:1>
Integrated into religion courses are required activities like
immersions, exposure trips, and tutorial jobs for abandoned or neglected
children.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#50:1>
In 1991 on the occasion of the centenary of Leo XIII 's encyclical,
<it> <foreign> Rerum Novarum </foreign> </it> , RSD had a series of talks on
the social teachings of the Church, centered primarily on John Paul II 's
<it> <foreign> Centessimus Annus </foreign> : Encyclical Letter on the
Anniversary of <foreign> Rerum Novarum </foreign> </it> ( 1991).

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#51:1>
NDCP inspired RSD to have a new purpose: <it> transformation
</it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#52:1>
In a more religious context, it is called <it> <mention> conversion
</mention> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#53:1>
PCP-II adds a qualifier through the phrase <it> <mention> social
transformation </mention> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#54:1>
RSD complemented its course on Church and Sacraments by setting up as
prerequisite a two-day retreat called the <indig> PAGKAMULAT </indig>
Retreat, meant to make students more aware of the social dimension of faith.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#55:1>
The <indig> PAGKAMULAT </indig> Retreat departs from traditional
retreats or recollections in that it includes nationalism and social
consciousness as values processed and inculcated in the activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#56:1>
The content of religion was updated through the introduction of
social consciousness in the courses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#57:1>
Two subjects that have direct bearing on the issue are CODEVEL (
Theology of Liberation and Development) and BUSIETH ( Ethics in the Business
World).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#58:1>
Drawing from the same social teachings of the Church, these courses
complement each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#59:1>
CODEVEL, which uses a spiritual approach to development based on the
social doctrines of the Church, infuses social dimension into BUSIETH.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#60:1>
BUSIETH, on the other hand, provides CODEVEL with analytical methods
to see the structures in the business world and their corresponding
relationships.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#61:1>
The social doctrines of the Church see to it that religion is not
relegated to the private sphere; analytical methods make sure that religion 's
role in national development is not merely to moralize but to make judgments
based on facts and reality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#62:1>
Methodology was updated, and one of the newer methods is
inculturation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#63:1>
Unfortunately, inculturation has been narrowly limited to a
superficial use of living and dead folklore and symbols.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#64:1>
An indicator that a symbol is already dead and dysfunctional is that
an activity surrounding it merely becomes a spectacle needing so many
explanations for people to understand.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#65:1>
Fortunately, today 's religion teachers have gone beyond gimmickry
and forced symbolization in recognition that modern Filipinos are aware and
have adopted other cultural elements.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#66:1>
We would rather go for Roche 's description of authentic
inculturation: it is by <quote> &ldquo; exercising students in seeing the
Christian message and values in their daily Filipino lives, and educating
them toward practicing these truths and values in their Filipino culture
&rdquo; </quote> ( Roche 1992:17). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#67:1>
We are aware of the DVEP.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#68:1>
It is a good attempt to bring about a more holistic approach to
education even in public schools.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#69:1>
Although we cannot expect DVEP to come up with religion or
Church-based values to disseminate like those in NCDP or PCP-II, yet in the
field of social responsibility and family life there are a lot of
parallelisms.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#70:1>
A cursory look at the DVEP framework fixes our eyes on &ldquo; the
human person &rdquo; and &ldquo; human dignity &rdquo; as the foundations of
&ldquo; core and related values. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#71:1>
The undergraduate religious program at DLSU reinforces and provides
continuity with the DECS Secondary Education Development Program ( SEDP) 's
values education program in high school. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#72:1>
<h> 1.3. <it> Establishing a Graduate Religious Studies Program </it>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#73:1>
Values education is the heart of education.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#74:1>
This is the rationale behind the Graduate Religious Studies program.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#75:1>
Some educators think that the DVEP seems to be just a glorified
&ldquo; Good Manners and Right Conduct &rdquo; course that was traditionally
taken by elementary and high school students ( Ulgado 1992:20).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#76:1>
At times, too, a values formation exercise in public schools and
other government institutions is really just a non-denominational version of
the &ldquo; Life in the Spirit &rdquo; seminar, replete with spontaneous
prayers and sharing of testimonies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#77:1>
The DLSU College of Education ( CED) believes that there is a need
for programs for the education of religion teachers that are based on sound
psychology and philosophy of education. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#78:1>
Part of a solution to the need is the strengthening of the
empirical component of research in Religious Education.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#79:1>
Program evaluation and multi-year planning become indispensable tools
for improving programs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#80:1>
Graduate study should include not only the students ' religious
knowledge and attitudes but also parents ' educational and economic status
and the general status of the environment ( Belita 1986:201).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#81:1>
An instrument that has been commonly used is that of Fr. Luke
Moortgat 's Philippine Attitudes Scale and Knowledge Orientation ( <indig>
PASKO </indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#82:1>
In a questionnaire like <indig> PASKO </indig> , aside from
traditional questions regarding dogma, are statements regarding the poor,
social justice, and other related social issues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#83:1>
Graduate students have to take educational subjects which include
statistics and research methodology.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#84:1>
Lest content be sacrificed, theological subjects are taught by
professional theologians teaching in RSD.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#85:1>
RSD and the graduate education program share faculty.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#86:1>
An indication that a religious program has departed from the
traditional one is that more than half of the instructors are lay people and
the takers are half religious and half lay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#87:1>
A method made popular by liberation theology and recent Filipino
Church documents like pastoral letters and PCP-II decrees has been used by
professors.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#88:1>
This is the <mention> &ldquo; see-judge-act &rdquo; </mention>
method.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#89:1>
In brief, it means that learners begin with a situationer, followed
by an evaluation or judgment of the situation according to the
Judaeo-Christian tradition.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#90:1>
Then, a decision to act is made that will bring about liberating
transformation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#91:1>
This, too, is associated with the <foreign> praxis </foreign> method
as opposed to a mere theoretical and academic approach to theology.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#92:1>
Government and non-government organizations can easily relate to a
kind of theology that gives primary importance to the real situation and to
the subsequent pastoral action taken. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#93:1>
Lately, our faculty members and graduate students, through the
Committed Associates in Religious Education ( CARE), have been giving
seminar-workshops to religion teachers in the provinces.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#94:1>
What has been accomplished in those workshops are the integration of
school curricula to the vision-mission of a school and the upgrading of
teachers on content and methodology.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#95:1>
Religion teachers from different provinces get to meet one another
and exchange experiences relevant to an inculturated and contextualized
instruction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#96:1>
Education in the countryside is one of the most neglected areas
in terms of national leadership.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#97:1>
Inaccessibility and unavailability of adequate resources are some of
the reasons.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#98:1>
That is why, since the CED started bringing educational resources to
provinces such as Isabela and Davao, religious educators have gone along with
them.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#99:1>
Considering the close collaboration of teachers in the provinces, the
training and formation given to the religion teachers of Catholic
institutions pass over to public institutions in those areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#100:1>
Overall, the contribution of DLSU 's RSD and RVEP to national
development has been a modest one.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#101:1>
Since we are dealing with students who have not yet assumed high
positions crucial to national development and social transformation, the
results remain to be seen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-003#102:1>
If what they have learned can already help them in their daily lives
as Christians in the world and in society, then we can already claim partial
success. </p> </I>
