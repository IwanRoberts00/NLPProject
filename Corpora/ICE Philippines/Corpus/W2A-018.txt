Is analogical problem solving of bilinguals affected by the
language in which the problem is given?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#4:1>
Three experiments study whether the language used for the problem
affects analogical transfer between word problems among Filipino-English
bilinguals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#5:1>
Subjects were given a set of study problems all of which were either
in Filipino or English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#6:1>
They were then given a set of analogous transfer-test problems either
in Filipino or in English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#7:1>
Experiment 1 showed a language-compatibility effect; transfer was
better when the language of the study and transfer-test problems were the
same.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#8:1>
Experiments 2 to 3 studied the locus of the effect.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#9:1>
The data suggest that language compatibility facilitates the retrieval
of relevant, superficially similar problem information but does not affect
the process of applying the same problem information to the new problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#10:1>
The results are discussed in terms of their implications to
problem-solving behaviour of bilinguals and to the education of bilingual
students. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#11:1>
<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#12:1>
In a growing global community, the proportion of bilinguals and
multilinguals in the world 's population is increasing fast.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#13:1>
More and more people are being required to think about information in
different language formats, by choice or out of necessity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#14:1>
Cognitive psychologists have long been studying bilingual memory and
language processing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#15:1>
Yet not much has been done to explore how bilinguals engage
higher-level cognitive processes like problem solving and reasoning in
different domains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#16:1>
How do bilingual people think when they are given problems to solve?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#17:1>
Is their problem-solving behaviour affected by whether the problem
information is presented in their first or their second language?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#18:1>
Does his or her mind store and process the problem-solving
information in a manner that is indifferent to the language format?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#19:1>
Is the processing affected only by the structural elements of the
problem, or does the difference in language format affect problem solving?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#20:1>
Answers to these questions have practical significance for
educators of bilingual students; these educators ' success might be affected
greatly by whether their materials and instructions are in the bilingual
student 's first or second language.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#21:1>
However, such answers are also important to those who study thinking,
particularly as the question relates to how the mind stores and processes
physically different but structurally and functionally similar information.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#22:1>
<h> <bold> Language and Transfer among Bilinguals </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#23:1>
One important aspect of problem solving is the ability to
transfer concepts and procedures acquired for one problem in one setting to
new problems in new settings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#24:1>
This ability is particularly useful when new problems that arise have
similar elements to previous problems that have been solved.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#25:1>
In such cases of analogous problems, the problem solver can
effectively solve the new problem by importing or transferring the solution
from the previous problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#26:1>
Research has shown that analogical transfer of this sort is not easy
for most problem solvers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#27:1>
Transfer seems to be constrained by numerous elements of the problem,
the problem-solving context, and the problem solver. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#28:1>
Among bilinguals, one factor that might constrain transfer is the
language format of the problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#29:1>
Some anecdotal evidence of bilinguals in the Philippines seems to
suggest that language format can in fact influence the transfer of
information.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#30:1>
Many Filipinos, who learn numerous concepts and skills after 16 or so
years of formal schooling in English, find it difficult to read, write, and
talk about the same concepts in Filipino, which is their native language.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#31:1>
It is not uncommon to see students who have learned a lot of very
specific problem-solving information in English, who also have a great deal
of difficulty in expressing and understanding the same information in
Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#32:1>
Similarly, in scholarly meetings where Filipino is used as the medium
of discussion, we often find American- or British-trained Filipino scholars,
whose first language is Filipino, but who hesitate and fumble when talking in
Filipino and then slip comfortably into English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#33:1>
Among these bilinguals, there seems to be some degree of language
specificity when it comes to processing information in certain domains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#34:1>
This language specificity could be studied as a problem of transfer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#35:1>
It is possible that the difficulty in using the Filipino language for
information that is learned in English is a demonstration of lack of transfer
of knowledge from one language context to another. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#36:1>
Previous research on analogical problem solving has shown how
superficial problem elements that are totally unrelated to the problem
structure can facilitate transfer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#37:1>
For example, Reed ( 1987) found that students rated a particular
problem 's solution as being useful for an analogical problem only when there
was a very high level of transparency between the problems; that is, when it
was easy for problem solvers to match the corresponding concepts between the
analogous problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#38:1>
In Reed 's study, transparency was highest among problems that had
similar superficial features ( i.e. story contexts) in addition to having
analogous problem structures.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#39:1>
Several others ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> Bassok, 1990; Bassok, Wu,
& Olseth, 1995; Catambrone & Holyoak, 1989; Haloyoak & Koh, 1987; Novick,
1988; Ross, 1987, 1989) have also found facilitation of analogical transfer
due to factors related to superficial similarities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#40:1>
For bilingual problem solvers, one can think of the problem 's
language format as a superficial problem-solving element that can affect
analogical transfer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#41:1>
It is within this general framework that the relationship between
language and analogical transfer was studied. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#42:1>
This study is an enquiry into effects of using the bilingual 's
first or second language in the transfer of information between analogous
word problems in mathematics.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#43:1>
In particular, it is an enquiry into the effects of using Filipino or
English on the transfer of analogical information between word problems in
probability among Filipino-English bilinguals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#44:1>
The study does not look into how structural differences between two
languages affect analogical problem solving.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#45:1>
Rather, the study focuses on the effects of language format
differences on transfer of information.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#46:1>
The study further addresses the matter of the locus of the effect of
language format on analogical transfer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#47:1>
There are several components in the process of transfer ( see,
<foreign> e.g. </foreign> , the models of Hoyoak, Novick, & Melz, 1994; Reed,
1987), and language similarity can affect any or all of these components.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#48:1>
In particular, language can affect the access and the use of
analogous problem information.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#49:1>
<mention> Access </mention> refers to the retrieval of the prior
problem-solving episode from which the analogous problem information can be
derived.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#50:1>
On the other hand, <mention> use </mention> refers to the
instantiation or adaptation of the retrieved analogous information to the new
problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#51:1>
Although these two components are related, they are very distinct
processes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#52:1>
For example, it is possible that the problem solver correctly
accessed the prior analogous problem but could not correctly use the problem
information to solve the new problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#53:1>
Likewise, a problem solver could have difficulty accessing prior
problem information that is otherwise easy to adapt to the new problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#54:1>
Indeed, Ross ( 1987, 1989) earlier showed that specific types of
superficial similarity ( e.g., story lines, object correspondences, etc.)
have distinct effects on the components of access and use.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#55:1>
In this regard, it is possible that language format affects transfer
by way of facilitating either easier retrieval of the appropriate prior
problem or the adaptation of the problem information for the new problem.

<h> <bold> Overview of Experiments </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#57:1>
In the three experiments reported, Filipino-English bilingual
subjects were given problems in basic probability.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#58:1>
Subjects were first given a set of study problems followed by a set
of transfer-test problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#59:1>
The study problems included the text of the problem, a description of
the quantitative relations in the problem and of the relevant principles,
concepts, and equations, and a worked-out solution for the problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#60:1>
The transfer-text problems consisted of a set of analogous problems
that were very similar in surface content to the corresponding study
problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#61:1>
The subjects were instructed to solve these transfer-test problems
without directly referring to the study problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#62:1>
The subjects were given study problems and transfer-text problems
either in Filipino or in English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#63:1>
Subjects ' performance in the transfer-test problems was coded in
terms of whether there was transfer of information from the corresponding
study problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#64:1>
Experiment 1 was designed to demonstrate whether the language used to
express the study and transfer-test problems has any effect on analogical
transfer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#65:1>
In particular, the experiment was designed to demonstrate a
language-compatibility effect.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#66:1>
Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to determine the locus of the
language-compatibility effect; that is, whether using the same language to
express the study and transfer-test problems facilitates either the access or
the use of the analogous problem information. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#67:1>
<h> <bold> EXPERIMENT 1 </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#68:1>
Experiment 1 is basically a replication of an earlier study (
Bernardo, 1994a) that showed trends suggesting a language-compatibility
effect in analogical transfer with word problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#69:1>
For the study phase, some subjects were given the set of study
problems in Filipino and the rest were given the problem in English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#70:1>
For the transfer-test phase, all subjects were given half of the
problems in Filipino and the other half in English. </p>

<h> <it> Subjects. </it> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#73:1>
Sixty-four General Psychology students at the University of the
Philippines, Diliman participated in this experiment as part of a class
requirement.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#74:1>
All subjects were bilingual in Filipino and English, reporting
Filipino as the language used at home and English as the main language used
in mathematics education.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#75:1>
Half of the subjects were randomly assigned to the Filipino-study
condition, and the rest to the English-study condition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#76:1>
The subjects were asked to rate their proficiency in speaking,
reading, and writing in Filipino and in English in a scale of 1 to 7 ( 1 =
not at all proficient; 7 = very proficient).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#77:1>
The self-ratings in the three language skills were combined to create
a composite proficiency self-rating score in the two languages.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#78:1>
The mean proficiency scores of the subjects in the Filipino-study
condition were 5.08 ( <it> SE </it> = 0.14) in Filipino and 5.31 ( <it> SE
</it> = 0.11) in English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#79:1>
For the subjects in the English study condition the corresponding
means were 5.29 ( <it> SE </it> = 0.16) and 5.45 ( <it> SE </it> = 0.14),
respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#80:1>
The scores for both study-condition groups were analyzed using a 2x2
ANOVA for mixed-factorial designs with study condition as between-group
factor and language as within-group factor.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#81:1>
The analysis revealed no systematic differences in proficiency
between the two groups, <it> F </it> ( 1, 62) = 1.13, <it> MSe </it> = 0.84,
<it> P </it> &gt; .10; neither was there any advantage in proficiency in
either language, <it> F </it> ( 1,62) = 2.67, <it> MSe </it> = 0.45, <it> P
</it> &gt; .10.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#82:1>
There was also no interaction effect between the two factors, <it> F
</it> &lt; 1.0.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#83:1>
These null results suggest that there were no gross differences in
the perceived proficiency in Filipino and in English across the two study
conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#84:1>
<h> <it> Materials </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#85:1>
Word problems in probability were created in four problem types:
conjunction problem with independent events, conjunction problem with
dependent events, disjunction problems with exclusive events, disjunction
problems with intersecting events ( see Appendix A for examples of problems).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#86:1>
Probability problems were chosen to ensure that subjects had no
extensive prior experience in the problem domain ( this was verified in the
background questionnaire), yet the problems were easy enough for those with a
background in algebra.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#87:1>
Four versions of each problem type were created; each version had a
different surface content.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#88:1>
One version of each of the four problem types was combined to form a
study set, making four sets of four study problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#89:1>
All study problems were first written in English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#90:1>
The English problems were than translated into Filipino by a research
assistant who was proficient in both languages.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#91:1>
To ensure that the Filipino and English versions were equivalent, the
Filipino translations were translated back into English by another research
assistant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#92:1>
For the transfer-test problems, a superficially similar analogous
problem was created for each of the study problems ( see Appendix B for an
example).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#93:1>
Half of these problems were written in Filipino and half were in
English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#94:1>
Using a counter-balancing procedure, it was ensured that across the
four sets of study problems each problem type had an equal probability of
having a transfer-test problem in Filipino or in English. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#95:1>
Each study problem was typed on a separate sheet.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#96:1>
Each transfer-test problem was also typed on a separate sheet, with
the problem on the top portion, and the rest of the page left blank for the
solutions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#97:1>
The study problems and the test problems were arranged in a random
order and combined to form a test booklet.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#98:1>
The test booklet included instructions for the study and test phases,
and a questionnaire on subjects ' language and mathematics backgrounds.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#99:1>
The instructions and questionnaire were written in Filipino for the
Filipino-study condition, and in English for the English-study condition.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#100:1>
The two language versions were prepared following the procedures
described earlier. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#101:1>
<h> <it> Procedure </it> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#102:1>
The subjects were run in groups not larger than 10.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#103:1>
Subjects in one session were randomly assigned to either the
Filipino-study or English-study condition and given the appropriate test
booklet.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#104:1>
They were instructed to read each study problem and to try to learn
the material as best they could.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#105:1>
They were encouraged to work through the problems themselves; each
subject was given a calculator for this purpose.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#106:1>
They were given 3 minutes to study each problem and they were told
when they had 30 seconds left for each problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#107:1>
After studying the four study problems, the subjects were then asked
to solve the transfer-test problems without directly referring to the study
problems; they could also use the calculators.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#108:1>
They were given 3 minutes for each problem and were informed when
they had 30 seconds left.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#109:1>
After completing the transfer-test problems, they filled out the
background questionnaire.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-018#110:1>
