<h> <bold> Did Adam and Eve live in Africa? </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#2:1>
<bold> Dean Jorge Bocobo </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#3:1>
IN THE WELL-KNOWN story from the book of Genesis, the first man
and woman were Adam and Eve.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#4:1>
Living at first in the Garden of Eden, before they were cast out for
partaking of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge, they were created
in the very image of God Himself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#5:1>
Who were Adam and Eve, the first human beings?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#6:1>
And where was the Garden of Eden?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#7:1>
When did they live there and when did they leave? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#8:1>
Jews, Christians and Moslems who all share this version of human
origins have pondered and speculated upon these questions for all the
millennia that the Book of Genesis has existed, first as part of the Jewish
<foreign> Torah </foreign> , then as the Christian Bible and later in the
Muslim <foreign> Koran </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#9:1>
A well-documented attempt to answer when Adam and Eve lived in the
Garden of Eden was that of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh in Northern
Ireland sometime in the 17th century.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#10:1>
The latter used the precise genealogies of the Jewish nation
contained in the Old Testament to work backwards to the seven days of
creation contained in Genesis, pegging them to have occurred sometime in the
year 4004 BC. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#11:1>
Actually, the good archbishop was trying to answer the question
of how old the earth is, but his calculation also applies to Adam and Eve
since both planet and people were created in the same week, if one takes
Genesis to be literally true. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#12:1>
Hardly anyone today accepts Archbishop Ussher 's estimate for the
age of the earth, certainly not the non-Christian civilizations of China and
India, which happen to be the most populous countries of the world and which
both have existing historical records of their continuous history from
thousands of years before the proposed date of 4004 BC. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#13:1>
<h> <bold> Earth age </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#14:1>
Modern geology estimates the earth 's age to be closer to 5
billion years, give or take a billion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#15:1>
This estimate is controversial too, with astronomers and cosmologists
mixing it up with the geologists over the age of the solar system, the Milky
Way Galaxy to which it belongs, and of the universe itself.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#16:1>
But there is consensus that the earth is much, much older than the
human species. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#17:1>
Treated scientifically, the whole question of the first human
beings, who they were, where they began and when, has become a part of the
theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin in his 1859 book, <mention>
&ldquo; On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, &rdquo;
</mention> which has, since its publication, revolutionized our
understandings of life on this earth, both human and nonhuman alike. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#18:1>
Of course, Darwin also confounded the religious concept of living
creatures like man by introducing the idea of evolution, in which species
arise not fully formed and well-defined, but as the result of long, slow, but
thoroughly dynamic process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#19:1>
So that to the list of questions posed above, one must add
perhaps the confusing question of how to define the human species to begin
with.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#20:1>
Along the tree of evolution, when can we start regarding a branch
containing manlike creatures as humans? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#21:1>
Until very recently, all the scientific light on the subject of
human origins was being shed by paleoanthropologists ( the &ldquo;
bonehunters"), who specialize in the search for and analysis of fossil
remains.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#22:1>
By painstakingly reconstructing these artifacts of bone and tools
found in the earth 's crust, these scientists have outlined the evolutionary
history of man from lower forms of life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#23:1>
A common misconception that has arisen in the public mind about
this whole field is that <quote> &ldquo; man is descended from apes."
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#24:1>
Actually, it is more accurate to say that both have a common
ancestor, probably some type of rodent! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#25:1>
In just the last decade or so, a whole new area of scientific
investigation has made major contributions to the search for Adam and Eve:
molecular genetics, a field of biology that would not even be born for a
hundred years when Darwin developed his theory of evolution.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#26:1>
Darwin developed his theory purely on the basis of observations he
made on the anatomy and distribution of animal and plant species.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#27:1>
He could not explain the physical basis for evolution, that is, how
it happens that the progeny of living things inherit the characteristics of
their parents and why subtle changes occur to produce the grand diversity of
life on earth.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#28:1>
That had to await the discovery and understanding of the biochemistry
of DNA - - deoxyribonucleic acid - - the molecule which contains the precise
instructions for the construction and development of all living things on
earth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#29:1>
How has biochemistry contributed to the search for Adam and Eve?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#30:1>
If we think about this problem as a detective would, and with the
benefit of hindsight 's 20/20 vision, it is easy to see why the
fossil-hunters may have been looking in the wrong place.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#31:1>
After all, since living human beings are direct descendants of the
original human beings, they actually contain a lot of the relevant physical
evidence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#32:1>
The DNA in the cells of all our bodies came ultimately from those
first human beings. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#33:1>
<h> <bold> Question of genetics </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#34:1>
Working along these lines in 1987, molecular geneticists Mark
Stoneking, Allan Wilson and Rebecca Cann at the University of California (
Berkeley) decided to test the idea that <quote> &ldquo; the question of
modern human origins is ultimately a question of genetics. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#35:1>
Their approach to the problem was based on the observation that a
certain portion of the DNA in the cells of all human beings, called the
mitochondrial DNA, or m-DNA for short, is inherited not from both parents,
but from the mother alone.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#36:1>
My m-DNA came directly from the ovum, or egg, which my mother
contributed and which was eventually fertilized by sperm from my father to
make me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#37:1>
Her m-DNA also came from my maternal grandmother, and so on, all
the way back to prehistory.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#38:1>
Likewise, my father 's m-DNA came from my paternal grandmother, and
so on, all the way back to some common ancestor, a woman we might call
mitochondrial Eve, the mother of us all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#39:1>
Now it turns out that m-DNA in humans mutates at some measurable
rate, accumulating subtle differences in biochemical composition as the
generations pass.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#40:1>
These differences and mutations can be counted and analyzed and used
as a kind of molecular clock. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#41:1>
Using this clock, geneticists can deduce from the number of
mutations that are observed in the m-DNA of geographically separated human
populations roughly when those populations split off from one another in
history. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#42:1>
<h> <bold> Out of Africa </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#43:1>
By studying the DNA in blood samples taken from African, Asian,
Australian, Caucasian and New Guinean ethnic groups, Stoneking and company
found 133 variants of m-DNA with a corresponding complement of mutations and
differences.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#44:1>
Based on the parameters of the molecular clock, they discovered that
the oldest m-DNA belongs to the group of Africans in their sample, which
supports the so-called <mention> &ldquo; Out-of-Africa &rdquo; hypothesis
</mention> currently subscribed to by the fossil-hunters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#45:1>
This picture, which places our &ldquo; Garden of Eden &rdquo; in
Africa, proposes that modern humans arose in Africa some 200,000 years ago.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#46:1>
Stoneking and his group then discovered a piece of the m-DNA
genetic sequences that was common to all the subjects in their human sample.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#47:1>
This piece had to have been inherited from a single, common female
ancestor of all humans alive today, or at least those represented in the
Stoneking sample. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#48:1>
This mitochondrial Eve, the most recent common ancestor of all
humans alive today along the maternal line of descent, was determined by
Stoneking 's groups as having lived somewhere in Africa between 140,000 and
290,000 years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#49:1>
Then, between 90,000 and 180,000 years ago, some of her descendants
left Africa and migrated to all the other parts of world, including the
Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#50:1>
How about Adam?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#51:1>
Another group of geneticists associated with Yale University
professor Robert Dorit, has developed a similar molecular clock along the
paternal line of descent, based on a portion of the Y-chromosome that is
inherited only along the male line. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#52:1>
By performing a study of separated human populations similar to
the Stoneking project, the most recent common male ancestor of humans alive
today was estimated to have lived some 270,000 years ago, again in Africa.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#53:1>
This study showed that the exodus from Africa seems to have occurred
some 156,000 years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#54:1>
Both dates are not inconsistent with the study of the matrilineal
descent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#55:1>
So has Genesis ' Adam and Eve been found by modern genetics?
Well, not really.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#56:1>
Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosome Adam are truly the female and male
common ancestors, respectively, of all humans alive today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#57:1>
But it is likely that they were not alone in the hypothesized
<mention> African Garden of Eden </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#58:1>
It is just that the other human women with whom mitochondrial Eve
lived, do not have living descendants today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#59:1>
Since their m-DNA can only be passed along through their daughter,
those of them who did not have girl babies will have no representatives alive
today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#60:1>
Likewise for Y-chromosome Adam.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#61:1>
In fact, the title of <mention> &ldquo; most recent common ancestor
of all humans alive today &rdquo; </mention> changes as the human population
changes by the process of the dying out of the various maternal and paternal
lines of descent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#62:1>
As for the title of the oldest common ancestors, the fabled Adam
and Eve, that will have to await future developments. </p> </I>

<bold> Asuncion David Maramba </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#65:2>
AFTER THIS confession, I may no longer get Christmas gifts except
from those who really like me; but like Rudy V. Romero, I suspect that many
of us are &ldquo; great recyclers. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#66:2>
I 'm just admitting that you know that we know that you know what we 've
been doing all this time to Christmas gifts ( and wedding gifts too). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#67:2>
Then why do I write about something done but not talked about?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#68:2>
Let 's say it might be a relief to be frank about yet another taboo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#69:2>
So let 's face it; 'tis the season for recycling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#70:2>
Have you ever opened a gift and asked, &ldquo; <indig> Ano 'yan?
</indig> &rdquo; <&> ( trans. What 's that?) </&> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#71:2>
I once turned over a gift in my hands, figuring out what it was.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#72:2>
My kids described it as <mention> &ldquo; the skull cap in electric
chairs, &rdquo; </mention> only this one was made of fibrous material similar
to a split coconut.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#73:2>
Its giver was not trying to be cute because she was a nonsense woman,
but she was thrifty and even <bold> this </bold> must not go to waste, I
didn't have the heart to recycle it on somebody.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#74:2>
I threw it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#75:2>
I still have another exotic gift at the bottom of my closet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#76:2>
It looks like a squirrel with goldpainted tail and feet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#77:2>
The rest is white glass &ldquo; mosaic, &rdquo; green for the ears
and red for the eye.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#78:2>
It 's for hanging on the wall ( for what?) to see my fragmented image
and be dazzled by reflected light?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#79:2>
It 's too cruel even for an &ldquo; exchange gift. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#80:2>
It 's the kind of gift for which you feel like saying <quote> &ldquo;
Return to Sender. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#81:2>
I once suggested a &ldquo; white elephant party &rdquo; hoping
that somebody 's junk might be somebody 's treasure.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#82:2>
I was shot down.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#83:2>
It wasn't such an original idea after all.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#84:2>
It had been done before and the poor hostess was dumped with white
elephants which even their owners refused to claim. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#85:2>
The height, I think of the situation 's absurdity was when a gift
I once gave actually came back to me!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#86:2>
I know because the route was very traceable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#87:2>
The most cold-blooded practice I 've been doing lately is - - as
gifts come in, out they go - - food, wine and whiskey ( my husband and I have
no minor vices), items we can live without in this shedding stage of our
lives.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#88:2>
By Christmas Day, half the work of &ldquo; classifying &rdquo; is
done and I can sit on the floor and open gifts much more slowly and with
greater pleasure. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#89:2>
Am I being a KJ <&> from killjoy </&> like the KJs in Ayala
Alabang last Halloween?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#90:2>
No, I 'm not trying to reinvent Christmas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#91:2>
On the contrary I 'm trying to recapture some of its lost spirit.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#92:2>
I 'm talking time, quiet time against the mad rush to the malls
to finish my list; quiet time to savor Christmas songs in the airwaves since
September, to be enveloped by the nippy winds even in this <foreign> El
Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> October, to feel that if you had but time to pause,
Christmas is already &ldquo; in the air. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#93:2>
I 'm talking just one Christmas party per family and some quiet time
before the <foreign> <it> Belen </it> </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#94:2>
I 'm talking joy.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#95:2>
Why must sheer joy over gifts be experienced only by children like a
grandnephew who then and there peeled off his T-shirt and put on the new one;
like a grandniece who looked up to heaven, rolled her eyes and sighed,
&ldquo; Oh, a <mention> Toblerone </mention> &ldquo; ; like my children who
used to rub oil on the wrappers trying to peep at the contents; like my
little son who said, &ldquo; <indig> Wala na ba akong tatalupan? </indig>
&rdquo; <&> ( trans., isn't there anything left to unwrap?) </&> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#96:2>
How can we feel the magic when we can't linger while shopping and
take time to say, <quote> &ldquo; Now, what would he really want?" </quote> ,
when in a pile of gifts it 's hard to find one that we can hold to our hearts
and say, <quote> &ldquo; How did you know this is what I wanted?" </quote> ;
when we 're exhausted unless you believe that exhaustion is part of the
spirit? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#97:2>
I 'm talking imagination that Rudy Romero misses in his
predictable pile of <quote> &ldquo; umbrellas, pen sets, organizers, desk
clocks, paper weights, desk sets and diaries. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#98:2>
How can we be imaginative when we have to buy and wrap gifts in
assembly-line fashion? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#99:2>
I 'm talking moderation when we and our children are being led to
believe that the higher the pile, the better; when the feeling of plenty has
become excess and it 's time to say &ldquo; Enough. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#100:2>
I 'm talking sharing because at a certain point <quote> &ldquo;
the superfluities of the rich are the necessities of the poor." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#101:2>
The umbrellas and bags with names of banks across them are basic
needs of the families of <foreign> lavanderas </foreign> , drivers,
construction workers, vendors, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#102:2>
Often, one of each has to make do for the entire year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#103:2>
The calendars we receive are eagerly accepted by them as fast as
they come.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-003#104:2>
Unfortunately, they have no use for the knickknacks we give each
other. </p> </I>
