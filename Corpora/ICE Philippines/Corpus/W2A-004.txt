<h> <bold> 1. INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#5:1>
Gender has long been recognized as a sociolinguistic variable (
Wolfson 1982, 1989; Librando 1972; Trudgill 1974, 1984; Labov 1972) that
conditions the way language is used in everyday social interactions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#6:1>
To illustrate, Labov observes that women use preferred, socially 'correct',
non-stigmatized phonological variants more than men.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#7:1>
Their tendency to use more 'correct forms' than men is upheld in
Trudgill 's Norwich study.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#8:1>
On the other hand, Wolfson 's investigation of compliments in American
society reveals the interaction of topic of compliment with the status and
the sex of the addressee.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#9:1>
The effect of status as a variable, she asserts, is very strong when
the sex of the addressee is male.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#10:1>
Her study shows that upper-status males seldom receive compliments
which have nearly nothing to do with appearance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#11:1>
In linguistic anthropological research, it is commonly assumed
that <quote> &ldquo; sexual differentiation of speech is expected to occur
whenever there is a social division that exists between the roles of men and
women - - that is, universally &rdquo; </quote> ( Gal 1984).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#12:1>
The underlying definition and differentiation of gender roles,
ingrained in boys and girls as early as the socialization process, nourished
by cultural norms and expectations, in turn, explains gender-related speech
differences ( Millet 1970).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#13:1>
To be feminine in the Philippine context, Mendez <foreign> et al.
</foreign> ( cited by Medina 1991) hold, girls are expected to be modest and
reserved, while to manifest masculine behavior, boys must demonstrate
courtesy to girls and sportsmanship.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#14:1>
To a large extent, these behaviors are equally reflected in the
differential speech of boys and girls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#15:1>
While there have been studies of linguistic differences between
men and women at various levels of language - - phonology, lexicon, discourse
even - - to this researcher 's knowledge there are no existing empirical
studies on the similarities and differences in men 's and women 's telling of
stories.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#16:1>
This study, therefore, attempts to fill that gap.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#17:1>
Specifically, this study purports to answer this question: Are there
gender differences related to the telling of first-person narratives with
reference to age, role relationship, topic, intimacy of interaction,
familiarity of interaction, and number of interlocutors? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#18:1>
<h> <bold> 2. RELATED STUDIES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#19:1>
Studies on gender distinctions in language use and form spring
from three angles of vision: the structuralist, variationist, and
ethnographic perspectives. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#20:1>
Sapir 's paper on <mention> &ldquo; Abnormal Types of Speech in
Nootka &rdquo; </mention> ( Philips et al. 1987) singles out sex and rank as
variables of social identity most likely to be signaled by linguistic form.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#21:1>
His subsequent paper centers on phonological variants of the same
morpheme and on the presence or absence of specific morphemes as means of
signaling gender and other aspects of social identity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#22:1>
In effect, he is suggesting that gender is <quote> &ldquo; marked
indexically into the morphology of a language &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#23:1>
Jespersen ( in Philips <foreign> et al. </foreign> 1987), on the
other hand, claims that lexical differences mark the linguistic distinction
between women and men.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#24:1>
This notion has subsequently influenced Lakoff 's research which
reveals that both English and Japanese women are more polite than men and
that they have maintained conservatism in language structure ( in Philips
<foreign> et al. </foreign> 1987). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#25:1>
Earlier, Lakoff ( 1975, in Wolfson 1989) has characterized women 's
language as <quote> &ldquo; language of the powerless", </quote> based on
observations and introspection.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#26:1>
She observes that women use almost exclusively certain words such as
<mention> <it> mauve </it> </mention> , <mention> <it> divine </it>
</mention> , even <mention> <it> cute </it> </mention> , emphatic modifiers
like <mention> <it> so </it> </mention> , <mention> <it> such </it>
</mention> , <mention> <it> very </it> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#27:1>
Women 's non-assertive behavior is encoded in questions and hedges.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#28:1>
Furthermore, they tend to use 'hypercorrect' grammar and punctuation,
that is, the use of more formal syntax and pronunciation closer to the
prestige form than men.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#29:1>
The use of excessively polite forms to express requests distinguishes
women 's speech as <quote> &ldquo; less convincing, less intelligent, less
competent, less trustworthy" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#30:1>
To determine whether all the features identified as elements of
Japanese women 's speech are part of a Japanese women speech register,
Shibamoto ( 1987) sampled speech data from situations in which women
typically emphasize femininity and those in which they do not.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#31:1>
Results reveal that lexical and morphological features seem to be
directly related to the impression of femininity, while syntactic features
like deletion and postposing do not.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#32:1>
She asserts that <quote> &ldquo; socially patterned syntactic
differences will generally be less subject to awareness than morphological
differences &rdquo; </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#33:1>
While accepting that linguistic differences between men 's and
women 's speech exist in Samoan society, Ochs ( 1987) considers this marginal
to what is shared by the speakers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#34:1>
In complex ways, she reports, social rank interacts with gender.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#35:1>
For other contexts, relative age and political status are better
indicators of usage patterns than gender.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#36:1>
Men and women of relatively higher rank speak differently from men
and women of lower tank, as shown in the expressions of sympathy in
narratives and the use of case markings in family conversations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#37:1>
The use of case markings in conversations outside one 's family is
conditioned by gender, age, and political status. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#38:1>
Labov 's study ( in Milroy 1987; Philips <foreign> et al.
</foreign> 1987; Trudgill 1974; Labov 1972) of gender differences in language
use stems from the variationist perspective.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#39:1>
Using language samples from actual speech of American English
speakers during taped interviews, Labov claims that women use preferred,
socially 'correct', non-stigmatized phonological variants more than men.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#40:1>
Women, in effect, engage in hyper-correction, that is, speaking more
like the middle class speakers than what they really are - - working class
members. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#41:1>
Trudgill 's ( 1974, 1984) Norwich study corroborates Labov 's
findings that women 's speech leans toward the more 'correct' and 'standard'
variety than men 's.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#42:1>
Contrastingly, men 's preferred speech behavior slants toward the
working class non-standard variety, perceived to be higher in status and more
prestigious.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#43:1>
This working class speech carries masculine connotations associated
with toughness and roughness, bestowing on its users 'covert prestige'. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#44:1>
On the function of <mention> 'you know' </mention> in women 's
and men 's speech, Holmes ' ( 1986) investigations reveals a pattern of use
which runs counter to the stereotype of women as unconfident
conversationalists.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#45:1>
Utilizing naturally occurring spontaneous speech, Holmes asserts that
while men use <mention> ' you know' </mention> more frequently than women to
signal the fact that the message is imprecisely and unsatisfactorily encoded,
women use it more often for positive functions, such as emphasis and as a
positive politeness strategy, as in expressing solidarity by generally
attributing relevant knowledge to their addressee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#46:1>
In Adams and Edelsky 's ( 1989) preliminary study on male and
female styles in political debates, it appears that gender has interactive
relationship with the persona, the experience of the candidate, the structure
of the event, the region, ethnicity, and probably other factors.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#47:1>
In other words, the differential language forms and discourse styles
used by men and women political debaters are inseparable from those
variables. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#48:1>
To assess the interaction of variable syntax and discourse in
women 's and men 's speech, Philips and Reynolds ( 1987) have analyzed
prospective jurors ' speech, focusing on the rate of contraction and deletion
of subject pronouns and auxiliary/main verb.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#49:1>
In this discourse-based approach, they have found that <quote>
&ldquo; men 's speech is less redundant than women 's in the context where
there is a relatively high degree of redundancy in information delivery
&rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#50:1>
Data show that men delete subject pronouns and auxiliary/main verbs
more often then women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#51:1>
Methodologically, the study is significant because it views gender
distinctions in language use in the context of naturally occurring speech
rather than in the context of sociolinguistic interviews. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#52:1>
The third approach to gender distinctions is ethnographic, in
which language is studied as <quote> &ldquo; it occurs naturally and normally
with particular attention to the ways in which the social features of the
context in which speech occurs interact with the forms of speech &rdquo;
</quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#53:1>
Investigating non-Western societies and using whole speech
genres, Sherzer ( 1987) suggests that gender differences in language use are
most likely to be governed by speaking roles and discourse genres associated
with those roles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#54:1>
In Kuna Indian society, for instance, men dominate the activities
related to public political meetings and illness-curing rituals.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#55:1>
By contrast, women perform lullabies and tuneful weeping during
keening which are private genres.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#56:1>
He claims that in relatively small-scale, homogeneous and
non-literate societies in which gender distinctions are well defined, it is
<quote> &ldquo; verbal genres, speaking roles and patterns of speaking that
are the primary linguistic manifestations of these gender distinctions
&rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#57:1>
This view contradicts the notion that variable grammatical
differences, not verbal genre differences, mark gender distinctions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#58:1>
Sex differences exist in Koasati, a Muskogean language spoken in
southwest Louisiana where women 's speech is considered archaic and 'better'
than men 's ( Haas, in Trudgill 1974).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#59:1>
At the present time, though, the women 's forms are used only by
older women and preserved in tales where a female character is speaking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#60:1>
In Malagasy, Keenan ( 1974) reports, open or direct confrontation
is avoided.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#61:1>
One is expected not to put another in an uncomfortable or unpleasant
situation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#62:1>
However, when a great need for direct speech arises, it is the women,
not the men, who break the norm and engage in confrontational talk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#63:1>
Librando 's ( 1987) ethnographic investigation of requesting
suggests that in the Philippine office setting, females tend to make more
requests than males.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#64:1>
This finding implies that requesting must be gender-dependent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#65:1>
Probing into gender-linked differences in language change in a
Hungarian-German bilingual town in Austria, Gal ( 1984) holds that women are
leading the shift from the use of Hungarian to German which is associated
with urban opportunity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#66:1>
Her ethnographic study shows that young women 's rejection of peasant
life, coupled by their refusal to marry local peasant men, preferring
industrial workers instead, explains the decline of stable bilingualism and
the use of only one language in all interactions in Oberwart, Austria.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#67:1>
Gal further argues that women 's language choices and their
linguistic innovativeness indicate women 's greater contribution to social
change. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#68:1>
<h> <bold> 3. METHODOLOGY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#69:1>
In collecting naturally occurring speech for this study,
sociolinguistic fieldwork was employed through participant observation and
non-participant or anonymous observation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#70:1>
Stretches of everyday conversations laced with personal narratives
formed the corpus of the study. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#71:1>
The language samples consisted of first-person narratives
recounted by Tagalog speakers in their conversations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#72:1>
A total of 60 narratives, 30 per gender, were generated by a variety
of narrators.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#73:1>
The females were represented by students, housewives, professors,
teachers, a bookkeeper, nurses, an overseas contract worker, a <it> <indig>
balikbayan </indig> </it> or Filipino expatriate in the U.S., a fish vendor,
househelp, a hotel cashier, on NGO director, and a grandmother.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#74:1>
On the other hand, the male tellers were college students, engineers,
a mechanic, a machinist, factory workers, an overseas contract worker,
policemen, a police officer, professors, drivers, PMA cadets, a veterinarian,
a newspaper vendor, and a <indig> barangay </indig> official.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#75:1>
Their ages ranged from 12 to 80 among the females, 17 to 55 among the
males. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#76:1>
A large number of speech situations in which the conversation was
interspersed with stories were sampled.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#77:1>
These included family encounters during reunions, barrio fiestas,
Christmases, death anniversaries, birthdays, All Saints ' Day celebrations,
arrival of <indig> balikbayans </indig> , and home visits.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#78:1>
Conversations containing stories and exchanged during social visits
after a woman 's childbirth; on New Year 's Eve; at the workplace such as the
faculty room, a police station; in school, at boarding houses, in private and
public transportation, during drinking sessions, even in service encounters
were represented in the corpus.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#79:1>
Metro Manila was the research site of the communicative events and
situations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#80:1>
What stories get told by Tagalog narrators in conversations?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#81:1>
As shown in Table 1 both female and male tellers can talk freely
about their weaknesses.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#82:1>
They are not embarrassed to disclose experiences that highlight their
flaws, ignorance, inadequacy, mistakes, failures, carelessness such as losing
things, being had by someone, being caught by authorities, fumbling in the
kitchen, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#83:1>
As if to strike a balance between negative and positive, they equally
share &ldquo; success &rdquo; stories like overcoming a phobia, displaying
&ldquo; survival &rdquo; skills, topping a board exam, bluffing their way,
landing a job, licking an incurable illness, refusing bribes, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#84:1>
Further, events beyond one 's control such as accidents and natural
phenomena are exchanged during conversations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#85:1>
Stories that dwell on relationships and family-related topics also
appear in the corpus.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#86:1>
'Exploits' and 'adventures', including chance meetings with movie
stars, are found infrequently in the data. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#87:1>
On topics beyond one 's control, Tagalog male narrators talk
about experiences on how they have been inconvenienced by unexpected delays
in trips or changed schedules, both of which are non-threatening to their
persons.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#88:1>
Female tellers, on the other hand, share personal experiences that do
not only inconvenience them but also directly jeopardize their safety, such
as being victimized by holduppers and pickpockets.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#89:1>
They also talk about natural phenomena like earthquake and fire which
endanger property, life, and limb.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#90:1>
One may ask: When women tell such stories, are they making a
statement about their helplessness before the might of others?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#91:1>
Does this reflect how society views women - - weak, fragile,
therefore, prone to being victims?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#92:1>
Why don't male tellers narrate what is expected of men - - alert,
agile, always in control of the situation, and exempted from &ldquo; falling
from grace"? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#93:1>
Even if there are only three occurrences of 'exploit' and 'adventure'
stories, they differ significantly in content.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#94:1>
The female narrator 's story centers on her first experience of
manipulating the slot machine at a Reno casino, seemingly a 'harmless'
exercise by a Filipino tourist on American soil.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#95:1>
By contrast, the 'exploits' in male stories carry sexual overtones.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#96:1>
Exchanged in an all-male context ( i.e., drinking session and
male-room talk) by participants of almost the same age, who have been
roommates for a long time or who belong to the same peer group, sex, a taboo
topic of conversation ( Andres 1989), surfaces in the narrators ' voyeurism
stories.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#97:1>
No such subject emerges in all-female contexts nor in contexts of
males narrating to a mixed-gender audience.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#98:1>
This clearly illustrates the interaction of gender, topic, age, and
familiarity of interaction in the telling of personal narratives.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#99:1>
The all-male context seems to nurture the telling of a taboo story,
told with <foreign> braggadocio </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-004#100:1>
Possibly, the presence of liquor may also have loosened up
inhibitions. </p> </I>
