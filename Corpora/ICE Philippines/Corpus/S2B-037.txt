<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#2:1:A>
When our Holy Father <,> announced that the World Meeting of
Families will be held in the Philippines the Bishops Conference of the
Philippines said it is very difficult so we passed on the job to Archbishop
to the Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Sin who performs miracles
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#3:1:A>
We begin the Fourth World Meeting of Families with the celebration
of the Holy Eucharist the sacrament of love that Jesus left for us his family
of faith the household of God the family of God
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#4:1:A>
How profoundly meaningful and immeasurably without price is God 's
gift of the Eucharist for us and for every family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#5:1:A>
Let us reflect briefly on the Eucharist and the family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#6:1:A>
The Eucharist tells us what kind of love God has for us and how we
in turn must love one another
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#7:1:A>
The cross of Jesus and the Holy Eucharist are the ultimate symbols
of authentic love
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#8:1:A>
For on the cross Jesus himself fulfills the word he had declared to
his disciples there is no greater love than this for one to lay down his life
for a friend
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#9:1:A>
His body broken on the cross his blood being poured out as an
offering to God his Father for the sake of all Jesus demonstrates the nature
and extent of his love completely unconditional utterly sacrificial totally
self-giving
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#10:1:A>
It is from the cross my brothers and sisters that a new people of
God a new family of faith was born
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#11:1:A>
Born in the pangs of the passion and death of Jesus born in God 's
incomparable love the promise in Jeremiah the prophet that we read this
morning of a new covenant and a new law written in the hearts of God of God 's
people is fulfilled
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#12:1:A>
At the Last Supper Jesus gives a new commandment love one another
as I have loved you so you also should love one another
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#13:1:A>
Our second liturgical reading from the first letter of John adds if
we love one another God remains in us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#14:1:A>
The blood that Jesus shared with his apostles at the Last Supper is
the seal of a new and everlasting covenant
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#15:1:A>
Every time then that we celebrate the Eucharist we also celebrate
the new covenant and our birthday as God 's people God 's own family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#16:1:A>
And if the commandment of love is at the heart of the new family of
God we did not wonder that the <.> ri </.> at the rite of Holy Matrimony with
which a new family a new human family begins the new husband is reminded of
the words of Jesus and later the words of Saint Paul to love his wife as
Christ loves his church
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#17:1:A>
Today 's gospel reading is the beautiful story of the boy Jesus in
the temple
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#18:1:A>
It tells us what it is to be a family of love
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#19:1:A>
In the story Mary and Joseph bring their son of twelve years old on
the regular pilgrimage to Jerusalem on the feast of the Passover the same
feast that Jesus would <.> trans </.> later transform into the new Passover
of the family of God the mystery of his passion death and resurrection the
cross and the Eucharist
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#20:1:A>
And in Jerusalem Mary and Joseph <?> leave </?> Jesus to follow
devotedly and faithfully the religious traditions of Israel traditions that
they had taught him at home traditions of believing of praying and of
worshiping
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#21:1:A>
At the end of the celebration Mary and Joseph discover that Jesus
is not with them they search for him with great concern and anxiety but with
the intuition of parents who know the hopes and dreams of their son
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#22:1:A>
They go back to the temple and there they see the young son
astounding the teachers of the law with his intelligent answers and questions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#23:1:A>
To the concern of his beloved mother Jesus lovingly and
respectfully responds why were you looking for me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#24:1:A>
Did you not know that I must be in my Father 's house
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#25:1:A>
Did you not know that I must be about my Father 's work
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#26:1:A>
In his heart Jesus hears the call of God to go beyond his home
beyond his village in Nazareth but now he must yet return home with his
parents Mary and Joseph
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#27:1:A>
Saint Luke sums up the life of Jesus with Mary and Joseph very
simply Jesus was obedient to them obedient to their teachings <&> break in
recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#28:1:A>
The love and life of Jesus revolved most obviously around Mary and
Joseph but most of all his love and life was centered on God
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#29:1:A>
It was also true for Mary and Joseph
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#30:1:A>
Life in the Holy Family is a lesson for every family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#31:1:A>
In every family life must be a life of love shared generously to
overflowing love that is finally expressed in service
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#32:1:A>
Life in the family must be centered on God
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#33:1:A>
This is the secret of advancing in wisdom and grace before God and
man and this too is the key to confronting the many challenges families of
the world face today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#34:1:A>
From the very beginning then my brothers and sisters the family as
founded on the totally self-sacrificing love of God is fundamental good news
for the third millennium
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#35:1:A>
But today you and I know that the family is facing the grave
challenge of a materialistic and secularist culture that is bringing bringing
in a new morality with no religious foundation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#36:1:A>
And this emerging global culture attacks fundamental scriptural and
ecclesial teachings and the very nature of life nature of death love and
marriage men women and children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#37:1:A>
It is a challenge that the world has never known before because
especially because it is so quickly disseminated through the tools of social
communication
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#38:1:A>
In the multicultural and multireligious Asian environment where the
Church is a tiny minority of less than two percent and in a democratic social
order such as the Philippines sometimes the Church seems to be but one feeble
prophetic voice against many contrary voices even more strident and sometimes
better heard than that of the Church
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#39:1:A>
We hope therefore that the Fourth World Meeting of Families will
inspire encourage and strengthen the Filipino family and the Asian family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#40:1:A>
We in the Philippines we are a poor country but rich indeed in
religious faith but sadly however we sometimes tend to separate faith from
life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#41:1:A>
And that is why at the beginning of the third millennium in January
two thousand one the Church in the Philippines has deliberately chosen the
Filipino Catholic family as the focal point of evangelization
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#42:1:A>
Concretely this pastoral thrust of the Church in the Philippines
means that all diocesan and parochial pastoral programs of evangelization
will be directed toward the renewal of the family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#43:1:A>
In this way the Filipino Catholic family as the domestic Church
will become an evangelized and evangelizing cell of basic ecclesial
communities of covenant communities village chapels and parishes all over the
Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#44:1:A>
At this point then my brothers and sisters may I express some hopes
not only for Filipino Catholic families but also for all the families of our
world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#45:1:A>
Hope with me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#46:1:A>
We hope that the Fourth World Meeting of Families will deepen
strengthen and quicken the faith of every family help transform every family
into a faith that into a family of faith that loves shares and serves a faith
that does justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#47:1:A>
We hope that every family would be a true sanctuary of love and
life ever alert and committed to defending and promoting human life in that
seamless continuum that God created it to have from the very beginning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#48:1:A>
We hope that all families would be totally imbued with the values
of the Gospel and of the Kingdom of God so as to be a powerful Gospel leaven
in society
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#49:1:A>
We hope that every Catholic family would be a school of faith of
love and prayer guiding the hearts of parents and their children to holiness
in the kingdom of God and to participation in the whole mission of the Church
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#50:1:A>
We hope that every Catholic family would be a fertile seed bed of
vocation not only to a socially transformational lay state but also to the
priestly and religious life while renewed in its sense of mission to its
milieu even extending its missionary concern <foreign> <?> ad jentes ad
dextero <?> </foreign> and <foreign> <?> ad vitam </?> </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#51:1:A>
And finally we pray that the Fourth World Meeting of Families would
assist the Church in the Philippines to realize these hopes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#52:1:A>
It is in this light my brothers and sisters that we Filipinos are
truly honored and privileged to be the first Asian host of the Firth Fourth
World Meeting of Families
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#53:1:A>
We are deeply thankful to our Holy Father Pope John Paul the Second
and to his personal special legate His Eminence Alfonso Cardinal Lopez
Trujillo and to them both <indig> Mabuhay </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#54:1:A>
Our country is one that is wonderfully devoted to our Blessed
Mother Mary whom we invoke in the litany as the Queen of the Family and we
beg today our Mother and Queen to be with us to intercede for us and keep us
united with her Son
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-037#55:1:A>
My brothers and sisters in the one family of God the world over
with the joy and peace of our Lord Jesus and in behalf of the more than one
hundred bishops of the Philippines <&> break in recording </&> and into the
one <&> break in recording </&> heart of the Filipino family <&> break in
recording </&> <indig> Mabuhay </indig> </I>
