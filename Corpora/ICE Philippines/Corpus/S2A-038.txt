<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#1:1:A>
Now I know that I succeeded in teaching <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#2:1:A>
That was a very very good lecture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#3:1:A>
Thank you very much Tish
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#4:1:A>
Uh <,> you do not know how happy I am because uh you are not the
professorial uh honoree <O> clears throat </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#5:1:A>
But with all you around here uh why you honor I don't know how much
 <.> hon </.> how honored I am with your presence here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#6:1:A>
Uh I do not have a unlike Brother Andrew who wrote his paper I note
that it is just <mention> Remarks </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#7:1:A>
Dr Castillo made a mistake when she said <mention> A Few Remarks
 </mention> it just says <mention> Remarks </mention> here uh in other words I
can make as many as I want <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#8:1:A>
Uh <.> ab </.> thirty years ago in nineteen sixty-two when I left
the Department of Education after uhm twenty-nine years in the Bureau of
Public Schools earlier Bureau of Education uh when I was leaving I can still
remember my friends at the General Office telling me there must be sand in
your head or rocks in your head there must be there 's something wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#9:1:A>
Here you are about to become a big shot a superintendent and I must
say that the ambition of every classroom teacher when he starts is to be some
day a division superintendent so that he will have many men under him <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#10:1:A>
But uh I had just gotten my P H D the previous year I got my P H D
very late uh and uh I became dissatisfied with what I was doing in the Bureau
of Public Schools as a General Office Supervisor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#11:1:A>
There was no time to think no time at all to think
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#12:1:A>
We would I would travel all over the provinces in for two weeks I
saw almost all the provinces in the Philippines then come home
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#13:1:A>
And what do I do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#14:1:A>
Write a report then afterwards while you are writing your report
your boss tells you <O> clears throat </O> <,,> I can still see my boss now
Mr Jose Cortes and Mr Tupas <.> befo </.> just before five o'clock time to go
home Boni will you please stay because we have to write a speech for the
Secretary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#15:1:A>
Well I was just a General Office Supervisor so I stayed and we
would write this speech because it was going to be read the following morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#16:1:A>
I thought that uh this was not the life I wanted so uh when I had
the request from the University of the Philippines and the Philippine Normal
College at the same time almost at the same time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#17:1:A>
One day the late Dr Aldana called for me and said uh Sibayan there
are two requests here for you to either go to P N C or to U P and he <.> sai
 </.> and he said if I were you I 'd go to the P N C because you are not a U P
graduate <O> laughter </O> Aldana <indig> ha </indig> Aldana <O> laughter
 </O> Director of Public Schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#18:1:A>
Those of you who know academe in this country know what that means
 <O> laughter </O> it 's a commentary on our <.> cult </.> on our culture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#19:1:A>
So I left and uh I remember Doming Landicho I 'm giving you his
name so that you know him from Batangas he said why do you leave now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#20:1:A>
Soon you 'll be <,> there in the Philippine Normal College you 'll
just be a classroom teacher
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#21:1:A>
You 'll have only maybe thirty forty students at most
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#22:1:A>
You must be crazy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#23:1:A>
I left
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#24:1:A>
I have never regretted my leaving <O> clears throat </O> the
Department of Education for academe because imagine the people I would have
missed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#25:1:A>
I would have missed you <O> laughter </O> I would have missed my
students and there are quite a number here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#26:1:A>
And even if they were not my students I would have missed people
with whom I would not have had the privilege of coming in contact trying to
pit one 's uh ability to think through a certain problem with another one who
thinks he has a better solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#27:1:A>
I think that 's there 's nothing more exciting than that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#28:1:A>
And then of course terrifying your students to quote <O> laughter
 </O> Tish last year she said terrifying your students to excellence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#29:1:A>
Uh let me look at my notes because
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#30:1:A>
You know at my age sometimes well it seems I 've accomplished
everything
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#31:1:A>
The only thing I don't have is money <O> laughter </O> uh but that 's
all right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#32:1:A>
Some day I 'll win the sweepstakes maybe
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#33:1:A>
Uh somebody asked me Well now you have accomplished practically
everything
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#34:1:A>
What do you want
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#35:1:A>
What 's your next ambition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#36:1:A>
And I said my next ambition is to reach my next birthday <O> 
laughter </O> because we 'll listen again to a lecture like this you know <O> 
laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#37:1:A>
There 's something to look forward to
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#38:1:A>
So I 'll live one <.> yea </.> one day and one year at a time right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#39:1:A>
So that 's my that 's of course I have many major and minor
ambitions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#40:1:A>
That 's a major ambition now yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#41:1:A>
A minor ambition is to make money
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#42:1:A>
It 's too late <O> he laughs </O> according to Nanette uh here it 's
too late that 's right it 's too late
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#43:1:A>
Uhm about two weeks ago I got a proposal for a doctoral for a
doctoral dissertation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#44:1:A>
After reading it <O> clears throat </O> I called up Dr Otanes where 's
Fe is she here oh I 'm disappointed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#45:1:A>
She 's Dean of the Graduate School and I said let 's postpone this
uh this colloquium because we 'll have a colloquium because I 'm going to
convince Brother Andrew and Tish Bautista to be members of the panel of uh of
those who will question this girl
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#46:1:A>
So I asked them what time they would be available and they said
they they would be available tomorrow afternoon at two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#47:1:A>
So we will be at the Philippine Normal College tomorrow afternoon
Brother Andrew and Tish and I to grill this girl uh she 's here <&> points
 </&> she 's there <O> laughter </O> on her proposal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#48:1:A>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#49:1:A>
Because here 's a proposal here 's a girl willing to do something
that nobody has ever attempted to do before
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#50:1:A>
And it is something that we should have scholars in in this uh
field uh <O> clears throat </O> besides of course uh I didn't know too much
about the subject
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#51:1:A>
It 's Tish Bautista who 's number one in the Philippines today in
that field and uh Brother Andrew is now a very close number two <O> laughter,
he also laughs </O> because he 's so busy in the <mention> Bulletin
 </mention> <O> laughter, he also laughs </O> and and
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#52:1:A>
Anyway so but when we find a student I think the most the thing
that is good about teaching especially in graduate school is that when you
 <.> bec </.> find a very good student that 's a gem you begin to become
excited you know you want to to mentor this student you you want to to to <,> 
I I cannot describe to you what what joy you can get uh by by working with
with a good student
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#53:1:A>
There 's there 's <.> no </.> nothing you can compare it with
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#54:1:A>
Uh Brother Andrew has a uh has an expression which I will not say
here because it is not said in polite company <O> laughter, he also laughs
 </O> but that that 's what I mean you see without telling you what he said
 <O> clears throat </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#55:1:A>
I 'm glad that I 'm very happy that Tish talked about the classroom
because I 've said many times I said it in fact about last month I think
January four when I spoke at the Philippine Normal College
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#56:1:A>
Without the classroom teacher without the classroom education will
not will not take place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#57:1:A>
Uh the teacher when the classroom teachers of the City of Manila
went on strike not all the superintendents and the supervisors and the
coordinators I don't know what kind of job is that coordinator not all these
uh non-teachers could do anything to educate the children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#58:1:A>
So the classroom is still <,> you you have to go back to the
classroom really to to get education going
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#59:1:A>
An uh oh the future I wish I were young again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#60:1:A>
I wish I were I said last year I wish I were sixty but this year
this time I think I wish I were fifty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#61:1:A>
Maybe next year if I will reach the one more year I 'll wish I were
forty and conquer the world <O> clears throat </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#62:1:A>
So one thing that we are trying to do now actually in fact it seems
my interpretation of Tish 's lecture is that finally we are trying to find
the problems in search of a solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#63:1:A>
You see we have many solutions uhm in fact teaching is when you
face the class the first time you begin applying what you know you know the
solution you never find out the problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#64:1:A>
Yes uh that 's why so many pupils fail because we don't know the
problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#65:1:A>
We have so many
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#66:1:A>
Look at for example the first comment the first recommendation of
the Angara Commission
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#67:1:A>
The decision is correct but the timetable is wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#68:1:A>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#69:1:A>
Because they know the solution but they don't know the problem when
they said that we are going to uh you know replace English in ten to fifteen
years from first year to fourth year uh high school uh with Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#70:1:A>
It just shows they know the solution but they don't know the
problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#71:1:A>
They are like my <O> clears throat </O> when I had my my windshield
wiper was not working so I brought it to the repair shop
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#72:1:A>
And I found a guy there trying to fix a car like that the lights
would not go go out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#73:1:A>
He tried everything he tried everything and then finally he gave up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#74:1:A>
He knew the solutions but he didn't know the problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#75:1:A>
So I 'm very happy that uh we 're going to find problems and
eventually find solutions <O> coughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#76:1:A>
You know if you will allow me to talk I can talk until tomorrow
morning but I 'll not do that <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#77:1:A>
Uh <,,> so uh <,,> by the way I was invited to talk on May eighteen
on uh on the role of grammar on uh in uh the development of Filipino but I 'm
telling Gani Cruz Isagani Cruz here who is going to run this that I 'm not
going to talk about that uhm the role of grammar as if I know the solution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#78:1:A>
No what I 'm going to talk about is uh <mention> <indig> Mga
Mahalagang Suliranin tungkol sa Pag-uunlad ng Filipino </indig> </mention> 
 <,,> okay good <O> laughter, clears throat </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#79:1:A>
So my friends thank you very much for coming here taking your
precious time and I know that at this hour to go home is uhm not only a
problem it 's a compounded one and uh I 'm really honored with your presence
and I hope that I will realize my ambition of reaching my next birthday and
that you will come again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#80:1:A>
Well and I hope one more of my students will read the next lecture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#81:1:A>
Thank you very much <O> applause </O> </I> 


 <I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#82:2:A>
<&> missing words </&> Uhm may I also thank all my friends
here uh the moment you appear here you are my friend yes <O> laughter, he
also laughs </O> like Colonel Ravina there whom I met and the lady I uh who
sits beside him who is your sister-in-law uh your sister your sister okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#83:2:A>
Your lecture Dr Ravina <.> redi </.> reminded me of many things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#84:2:A>
I was reminded of that the most famous one of the most famous uh
letters written in the teaching profession during the early days of this uh
century
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#85:2:A>
Uh any old teacher like me knows this uh story this
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#86:2:A>
Uh there was this lady who turned in her resignation and uh uh said
uh you know at that time every <,,> if you write to the Division
Superintendent of Schools it 's always <mention> the Division Superintendent
of Schools Baguio </mention> and it 's always <mention> Sir </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#87:2:A>
If you are below if you are inferior in position you say <mention> 
Sir </mention> but if you are superior and you write to a teacher it is
 <mention> Dear Sir </mention> or <mention> Dear Madam </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#88:2:A>
<X> And this teacher <.> res </.> tendered her resignation and said
uh <quote> Sir I have the honor to resignate because the salaries are too few
and the works are too many and besides that the supervising teacher are
always is always making too many lovings to me </quote> </X> <O> laughter
 </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#89:2:A>
Now this is one of the most famous uh resignations in the annals of
Philippine <O> laughter </O> education
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#90:2:A>
Uhm I do not know whether her resignation was accepted or not <O> 
laughter </O> but it must have been <O> he laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#91:2:A>
Uhm errors errors errors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#92:2:A>
Uhm <,> Dr Otanes who 's here who was my colleague at the
Philippine Normal College once told me that English has not deteriorated
because we always say <mention> the deterioration of English in the
Philippines </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#93:2:A>
No English has not <.> deser </.> deteriorated and it is still
there very good
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#94:2:A>
The <.> peop </.> the ones that have deteriorated are the teachers
and the pupils
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#95:2:A>
Maybe that 's true
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#96:2:A>
So uh now uh <O> clears throat </O> <,,> there is I think a
difference between correctness of English and acceptability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#97:2:A>
You mentioned about acceptability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#98:2:A>
My favorite story or anecdote about this is about this man who
worked in a shipyard and he noticed that during lunchtime nobody would like
to have lunch with him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#99:2:A>
All the other workers would group themselves and he would be left
alone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#100:2:A>
And uh uh one day he had the courage to ask one of his friends why
is it that nobody wanted to have lunch with him and uh he was always left
alone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#101:2:A>
And so the man said Brother do you want to know the truth or shall
I tell a lie
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#102:2:A>
And he said uh tell me the truth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#103:2:A>
Look he said do you not notice in this dockyard he said you are
the only one who is always saying <mention> those ships </mention> while
everyone here says <mention> them ships </mention> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#104:2:A>
So it may be wrong but it 's the acceptable thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#105:2:A>
So sometimes we are uh we don't know those of us who have taught
English is it correct but not acceptable or wrong but acceptable
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-038#106:2:A>
That 's a that poses a dilemma </I>
