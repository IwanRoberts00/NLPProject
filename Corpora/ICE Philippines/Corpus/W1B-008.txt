<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#2:1>
Dear <indig> Ate </indig> Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#3:1>
It 's been a long while since I heard from you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#4:1>
I 've also been quite busy with work and my stint as a flower
arranger. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#5:1>
So, how 's life in Japan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#6:1>
Pretty cold I guess.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#7:1>
Are there holidays in December?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#8:1>
Mommy says you 've been preparing for her trip this coming March.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#9:1>
We 've taken pictures of Mommy 's birthday so we can send it to you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#10:1>
Hopefully it 'll be developed this weekend ( before I mail this
letter). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#11:1>
I have a new officemate named &ldquo; Bunny &rdquo; ( Anna del
Castillo).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#12:1>
She said she met you in the Church.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#13:1>
We 're in the same unit of the bank.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#14:1>
Bunny and I usually go home together and I get to have a free ride
whenever she gets to bring her mom 's car with her.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#15:1>
We get along well on our eating sprees.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#16:1>
She even described the big bowl of spaghetti at <foreign> Cappriciosa
</foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#17:1>
During Mommy 's birthday, <indig> Ate </indig> Gigi made tuna
<foreign> sushi </foreign> and it was a hit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#18:1>
It disappeared after 10 minutes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#19:1>
And we had to reserve for <indig> Lola </indig> and Tatat.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#20:1>
There was a mouth-watering <foreign> lechon de leche </foreign> from
<indig> Kuya </indig> Ton, stuffed turkey from <indig> Ate </indig> Aggie,
and <indig> bulalo </indig> to the bones from Kuya Jet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#21:1>
There was a lot of food and I think <indig> Lola </indig> got to save
her meal budget for three days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#22:1>
Ni&ntilde;o can already identify the things in his picture
dictionary like <mention> bus, car, van, box, ball, </mention> <foreign> etc.
</foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#23:1>
And whenever we recite the evening prayer, he can only say <mention>
amen </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#24:1>
He still loves his toy airplane, cars, and trains among the toys he
got from <indig> Kuya </indig> Joel and <indig> Kuya </indig> Mikko.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#25:1>
I guess <indig> nagmana talaga sa tatay niya </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#26:1>
Last week, I even saw him sleepwalking by my bed! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#27:1>
Tato is presently in Davao and won't be able to return until the
22nd.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#28:1>
So the Bautista reunion is definitely out of his calendar.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#29:1>
It 'll be a hectic December over here, with Doctor Wewe treating us
on his birthday, a party for <indig> Ate </indig> Aggie 's wedding
anniversary and the Bautista reunion.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#30:1>
We 'll be borrowing a house in Baguio from Tato 's officemate for the
last week of December.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#31:1>
He 's been looking forward to this all year round.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#32:1>
Hopefully this would push through.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#33:1>
Christmas will be another extended event this year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#34:1>
Good news is I 'll be promoted to Senior Marketing Assistant
effective January 1.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#35:1>
Also, I might be infanticipating ( ? ? ? ) hopefully that is.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#36:1>
If it 's confirmed, you 'll be one of the first to know.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#37:1>
I 'm praying that it will be a girl.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#38:1>
I 'm keeping my fingers crossed! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#39:1>
Here 's wishing you an exciting Christmas holiday and a bountiful
year to come. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#40:1>
Much love,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#41:1>
Tato, Joville and <foreign> Ni&ntidle;o Bonito </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#42:1>
A Very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#44:2>
Dear <indig> Ate </indig> Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#45:2>
Greetings from Kobe, Japan!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#46:2>
We hope that you are in good health and enjoying the holiday season.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#47:2>
Our apologies for sending this Christmas message late.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#48:2>
Bebot has been travelling a lot, mostly to China, and Lisa 's had to
take care of the house as well as the kids.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#49:2>
In fact, we will be moving to Guangzhou, China this summer, once
school ends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#50:2>
Bebot will be moving ahead of the family. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#51:2>
It has been a wonderful year for us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#52:2>
EJ is in middle school ( sixth grade).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#53:2>
He is enjoying himself in middle school because the class schedule is
more flexible than in elementary and there are more extracurricular
activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#54:2>
In fact, he is actively into sports and oftentimes stays after school
to work on his projects.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#55:2>
He is a B student and does very well in math.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#56:2>
He has gone on overnight as well as 3 day trips with his class or his
friends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#57:2>
Edmund is more comfortable with the computer and can handle intricate
programs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#58:2>
Monica is in second grade and is an A student.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#59:2>
Her teacher, Mr. Nelson, is extremely happy with her progress in
school.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#60:2>
She continues to have a lot of friends and reads a lot causing her
nearsightedness to increase.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#61:2>
Three of her friends have moved - to Israel, Tokyo and Hongkong.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#62:2>
She loves to sing and draw.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#63:2>
One of her friends thinks she will win an award in the opera. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#64:2>
Johann is in kinder B ( almost first grade) and is also doing
very well in school.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#65:2>
He speaks clearly with an American accent and has a lot of friends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#66:2>
His two friends are from Switzerland.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#67:2>
He now stays in school the whole day, leaving Lisa free to pursue her
own interests ( most of the time).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#68:2>
He now participates in extracurricular activities and plays
basketball with his classmates every Saturday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#69:2>
He will be six years old next month, at which time he will need to
pay for train rides. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#70:2>
Lisa has a hectic schedule; she hardly has time to shop.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#71:2>
She has earned her first <foreign> Ikebana </foreign> certificate in
the Ohara school and will continue lessons till March.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#72:2>
She 's on her way to completing Level 1 of Japanese, taking two-hour
lessons once a week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#73:2>
She also teaches cooking and baking at Canadian Academy; she has
twelve 6th grade students for her Wednesday afternoon class.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#74:2>
She has also appeared on Japanese TV together with her friend,
Marlene Sogono, demonstrating Filipino cooking and prepared a special
Christmas table with a <indig> Belen </indig> and talked about how Xmas is
celebrated in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#75:2>
Lisa also helps 1st & 2nd grade students with storywriting on the
computer on Thursdays and is active as secretary of the PHILKOBE, a Filipino
association here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#76:2>
She teaches Sunday school to 8 kids from KA-1st grade, twice a month.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#77:2>
Johann is so excited to be in her class. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#78:2>
Bebot continues to travel a lot, spending close to half of his
time outside Japan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#79:2>
He is still involved with school, being a member of the Educational
Policy Committee and coach of Johann 's basketball team. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#80:2>
The family went to Okinawa for 5 days to relax and take it easy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#81:2>
It was a very enjoyable trip.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#82:2>
The weather was excellent and the hotel was great, except for the
food.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#83:2>
Now, we are back in Kobe, experiencing our third winter season in
Japan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#84:2>
In China, we will be staying in one of the apartments at the
Garden Hotel and will be able to travel to the Philippines more frequently.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#85:2>
Bebot will also be travelling less frequently.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#86:2>
Lisa and Bebot visited Guangzhou last October and went to the
International School.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#87:2>
This transfer will be our fifth in 10 years.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#88:2>
We 'll let you know our new address. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#89:2>
So long for now.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#90:2>
All the best for the new year. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#91:2>
Bebot, Lisa, EJ, Monica and Johann </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#93:3>
My dear Tish:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#94:3>
I envy you the <foreign> sushi </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#95:3>
( Do you ever get <foreign> shabu-shabu </foreign> ? )

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#96:3>
On the whole, the new life sounds pretty good to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#97:3>
Of course there are the crammed and hectic four days of slow classes
but the long weekends should compensate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#98:3>
Doing your own laundry is a drudgery but it is small price to pay for
new experiences.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#99:3>
We 're too, too spoilt in the Philippines, that 's what I 've always
maintained.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#100:3>
Missing people - - well, that 's the bigger price and not to be
scoffed at.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#101:3>
I don't have any solution to ease this, never had one in the 19
years I 've been away.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#102:3>
The fact that I 've been labelled <mention> loner </mention> does
not help - - even loners prefer some people and do miss them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#103:3>
So what to do, how to handle a Big New Life?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#104:3>
You do the laundry and miss people and long for many familiar
sounds.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#105:3>
But you also learn many new things, fascinating new nuances, gain
new insights. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#106:3>
And you are grateful for the interesting life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#107:3>
Please write. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#108:3>
Much love

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#111:4>
Dear Tish:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#112:4>
I trust you 've recovered from not having spent Christmas in
Manila and from missing Gabby Concepcion 's <quote> &ldquo; quiet and private
wedding &rdquo; </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#113:4>
Anyway by this time you will have discovered that one can miss
things and yet have a reasonably fun time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#114:4>
Besides, don't we need a quieter Christmas every now and then?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#115:4>
Makes us remember what the day is all about.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#116:4>
But why am I delivering such an Epistle on your birthday?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#117:4>
A bad habit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#118:4>
Which means this old friend of yours hasn't ( may never) changed.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#119:4>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#122:4>
Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#123:4>
Ian and I have just started our joint project - - a book on
post-war executions of ( war) criminals.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#124:4>
The research has been most interesting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#125:4>
The writing, as usual, is another matter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#126:4>
Very challenging, rather stressful.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#127:4>
However, there 's much to learn and the old marbles are kept busy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#128:4>
What are your plans for Christmas? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#129:4>
Regards.

Dear Tish:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#133:4>
I sent your greeting card to Manila; how could I have known that
you 'd opted to do needle work in Tokyo?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#134:4>
I hope you enjoyed my book - - I never thought I 'd finish it!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#135:4>
Had reasonable sales and got excellent reviews. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#136:4>
And you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#137:4>
Are you staying on after April or are you extending the exile? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#138:4>
We 'll be in Sydney for a whole month from the 2nd of Jan.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#139:4>
Back on the 5th of Feb.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#140:4>

Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#144:5>
We are on a business trip, talking to agents and publishers and
taking in Tokyo, Machida, Yokohama, Hiroshima and Kyoto. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#145:5>
This country will remain puzzling to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#146:5>
I told someone that it reminds me of golf - there are hazards
everywhere but one plays on. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#147:5>

Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#151:6>
We are on the second month of a book promotion tour and have now
come to New Zealand after a month covering the Australian states.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#152:6>
Ian 's latest book - the wrongful execution of a Japanese general by
the Australians - has stirred sufficient controversy and amassed reams of
publicity.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#153:6>
It 's been a hectic, successful trip made occasionally pleasurable
by beautiful scenery, excellent wines and delightful oysters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#154:6>
I trust you are well. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#158:7>
Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#159:7>
Since my operation last Friday ( Jan. 26) I 'm holed in at
Lorain ( my brother 's house, not Bro. Andrew 's, his house is at Westlake).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#160:7>
You see Lorain house is closer to my hospital, that 's why. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#161:7>
It has been snowing for several days, although the sun is up,
but the temp goes down to low 16 &degree;. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#162:7>
I was asking my brother, how soon can I go home, but he does not
give me a good answer.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#163:7>
I 've an inkling he wants me to stay longer.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#164:7>
As a matter of fact he wants me to live here, which idea is
obnoxious to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#165:7>
I like it here for a short vacation ( this time it 's not a vacation
and I don't like it) but not for keeps.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#166:7>
I just can't understand why I can't convince them that the best life
ever, is life in the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#167:7>
The final report of my biopsy came this morning, and it made me
very happy, it is &ldquo; benign &rdquo; and it is simply fibroid, not the
real tumor.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#168:7>
I feel like jumping which I could not, cause my incision is still
painful.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#169:7>
But it has wiped away all fears and thanks for all your prayers.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#170:7>
I 've been praying hard too, and I think my prayers are always
answered.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#171:7>
I guess I 'm ready again for another &ldquo; blow out &rdquo; in
thanksgiving. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#172:7>
Speaking of &ldquo; blow outs &rdquo; I 'm very sorry I 'll miss
your B-day blow-out.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#173:7>
But can I have a rain check for it? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#174:7>
My one day at the hospital made me realize that my brother has
very good friends here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#175:7>
Imagine, when I was wheeled into my room, I had the biggest
surprise.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#176:7>
My room was filled with bouquets of flowers and baskets of fruits
from them, all wishing me the best of health.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#177:7>
Another blessing I never expected. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#178:7>
Bye for now, and a very Happy Birthday again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#179:7>
Pls. give my love to everyone - - you know who they are. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#182:8>
from New York

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#183:8>
Dear Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#184:8>
Arrived here last Oct. 22.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#185:8>
I 'm beginning to enjoy a very relaxed life, no time, job, and above
all <indig> chismis </indig> to worry about.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#186:8>
Having second thoughts <del> of </del> about going back -

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#187:8>
Gone to 3 Broadway plays already, just arrived from a weekend in
Exeter, New Hampshire, a shopping spree in Kittery, Maine, and will be seeing
&ldquo; Beauty & the Beast &rdquo; ( Broadway) tonight.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#188:8>
What more can I ask? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#189:8>
What 's the latest news from La Salle?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#190:8>
They were forming another &ldquo; Search team &rdquo; for executive
vice president, and perhaps VPA, in case Lita accepts the VP for the system,
when I left. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#191:8>
I 'll be going back by the second week of January of next year,
in case I change my mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#192:8>
Happy Holidays again. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-008#193:8>
Love,
