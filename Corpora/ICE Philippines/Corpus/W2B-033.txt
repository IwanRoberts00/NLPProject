<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#3:1>
DR. PABLITO Pamplona of the University of Southern Mindanao in
Cotabato can be justifiably proud of three packages of fruit production
technologies that the agricultural research consortium that he heads had
developed in the last five years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#4:1>
He presented these technologies at the 25th anniversary
celebration recently of PCARRD, the agency that coordinates research in
agriculture, forestry and natural resources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#5:1>
One of the simple but very practical technologies his group had
developed is the intercropping of <foreign> <it> durian </it> </foreign>
under tall coconut trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#6:1>
He said that this practice has already been adopted in about 3,000
hectares.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#7:1>
The technology will be further utilized as some growers in the
coconut-producing provinces of Luzon have started to adopt the idea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#8:1>
The technology, Dr. Pamplona emphasized, can make the farmers '
operations profitable.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#9:1>
He pointed out that usually, a one hectare of coconut plantation would
net the owner only about &peso;15,000 a year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#10:1>
With the <foreign> <it> durian </it> </foreign> intercrop, the profit
could increase to more than &peso;15,000 once the <foreign> <it> durian </it>
</foreign> trees become productive eight to 10 years after intercropping.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#11:1>
As the <foreign> <it> durian </it> </foreign> trees grow older, the
net income would become even bigger. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#12:1>
Dr. Pamplona noted that establishing a <foreign> <it> durian
</it> </foreign> plantation under coconut trees is much cheaper than in the
open field because only minimal land preparation is required.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#13:1>
Maintenance of the trees during their growing period is also less
expensive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#14:1>
The intercropping technology is not limited to coconuts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#15:1>
Dr. Pamplona and his colleagues have also perfected an equally
profitable scheme of intercropping <indig> <it> lakatan </it> </indig> banana
with <foreign> <it> durian </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#16:1>
This practice has already been adopted in about 2,500 hectares,
according to the fruit expert. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#17:1>
He said that <foreign> <it> durian-lakatan </it> </foreign>
intercropping can produce an income of about &peso;100,000 per hectare in
just one year after plantation establishment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#18:1>
This means that the farmer does not have to wait a long time to
recover his investment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#19:1>
Besides the early income from the bananas, the shade that they
provide, the seedlings makes the <foreign> <it> durian </it> </foreign> trees
grow faster.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#20:1>
There is also less mortality among the <foreign> <it> durian </it>
</foreign> trees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#21:1>
The other package of technology that Dr. Pamplona is very proud
of is the production of what he calls Inarched Large Planting Materials (
ILPM) which enables growers to produce vigorous planting materials that will
fruit in just three to four years.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#22:1>
ILPM are produced from large branches of fruit-bearing <foreign> <it>
durian </it> </foreign> trees which may otherwise be pruned off.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#23:1>
He said that the technology is now being extensively used by
nurserymen and farmers, especially in Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#24:1>
Another innovative <foreign> <it> durian </it> </foreign>
propagation technique that the Central Mindanao consortium has developed is
the so-called Modified Bud Grafting or ( MBG).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#25:1>
Buds from mature trees are grafted onto newly sprouted <foreign> <it>
durian </it> </foreign> seedlings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#26:1>
With this technology, bud-grafted seedlings could be produced at a
cost of only &peso;5 each. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#27:1>
These bud-grafted seedlings can be bought by farmers which they
could grow into large planting materials in two to three years before
planting them out in the field.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#28:1>
The MBG seedlings also have another advantage.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#29:1>
Big numbers could be transported easily even to long distances as
they can be packed bareroot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#30:1>
Dr. Pamplona said that the Cojuangco farm is now using the MBG
technology to mass propagate a selected <foreign> <it> durian </it>
</foreign> variety from Malaysia which is said to be superior in productivity
and eating quality to the top varieties from Thailand such as Monthong and
Chanee.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#31:1>
Cojuangco is planning to plant some 900 hectares of this Malaysian
variety in Davao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#32:1>
Dr. Pamplona acknowledged the support of Sen. Nikki Coseteng in
the development of the MBG technology.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#33:1>
He said that Coseteng had provided some financial support to the
project from her CDF or countrywide development fund.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#34:1>
Another source of fund to develop the technology was the <indig> <it>
Gawad-Saka </it> </indig> Outstanding Scientist Research Grant which he got
as a result of having been given the Outstanding Scientist award a couple of
years back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#35:1>
The other outstanding package of technology that Dr. Pamplona and
his colleagues have developed is on the production of <foreign> <it> lanzones
</it> </foreign> and its close relatives, particularly <foreign> <it> Duku
</it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it> Longkong </it> </foreign> - - all
belonging to the <foreign> Lansium </foreign> family. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#36:1>
Global Technology Search ( GTS) carried by Dr. Pamplona 's group
during the last five years led to the identification of superior technologies
in <foreign> <it> Longkong </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it> Duku </it>
</foreign> production in Thailand and Malaysia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#37:1>
On-farm and adoption research by the Central Mindanao consortium
revealed that these technologies are effective in improving the production of
<foreign> <it> lanzones </it> </foreign> in terms of increased yield,
off-season fruit production, and better quality fruits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#38:1>
Dr. Pamplona pointed out that when the practices used in Malaysia
were applied to <foreign> <it> lanzones </it> </foreign> in Kabacan,
Cotabato, the local <foreign> <it> lanzones </it> </foreign> became also very
productive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#39:1>
The package of technology on <foreign> Lansium </foreign>
production include superior practices in irrigation, fertilization, pruning,
cropping systems, off-season flowering and fruiting, control of pests and
diseases, and proper postharvest handling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#40:1>

<h> <bold> Ranching the Sea </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#43:2>
<bold> Zac B. Sarian </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#44:2>
THE NEW frontier in food production now appears to be open
sea--the less-sheltered areas of the sea that have been yielding less and
less for capture fisheries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#45:2>
This is the belief of Philip S. Cruz, a fisheries expert who has
been developing innovative systems of fish culture.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#46:2>
Earlier, he has devised an automatic fish feeder that makes feeding
one 's fish much easier and more economical. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#47:2>
Today, he has come up with another major innovation that will
enable producers to raise fish even in the less protected areas in the sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#48:2>
This is what he calls the Aquaranch Seacage System. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#49:2>
He points out that in the last 10 years, aquaculture got a boost
in foodfish production with the development of pen and cage farming
technology in lakes and marine waters.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#50:2>
This has effectively provided the much need fish supply already
dwindling from capture fisheries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#51:2>
He hastens to add, however, that serious problems have cropped up
with the burgeoning of fishpens and cages--the destruction of the environment
as a result of overcrowding and the inevitable pollution.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#52:2>
And he cites the fishkills and other environmental problems in Laguna
de Bay, Bolinao in Lingayen Gulf, Pansipit River in Taal, Lake Sebu in South
Cotabato and others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#53:2>
The overcrowding resulted because the preferred sites for
aquaculture are the well-sheltered areas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#54:2>
However, since such places are limited, farmers tend to flock in
these areas and overdevelop them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#55:2>
This results in localized deterioration of water quality which means
slower growth of the fish and prevalence of diseases, according to Philip.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#56:2>
He further explains that sheltered areas have less water movement,
hence more prone to pollution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#57:2>
Focusing fishpen and cage culture in sheltered areas likewise
creates other problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#58:2>
Aside from environmental pollution, putting up the aquaculture
structures in sheltered areas will likely result in conflict with fishermen
who use the areas for fishing as well as sheltering their boats.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#59:2>
It could also run in conflict with the tourism industry as what has
happened at Hundred Islands in Pangasinan, according to Philip. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#60:2>
He strongly believes that for aquaculture to become
neighbor-friendly and grow on a sustainable basis, fish farming activities
have to move to deeper and less sheltered waters.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#61:2>
Here, he says, environmental impact is greatly reduced.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#62:2>
Water quality is better, and conflicting resource use with other
industries is avoided. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#63:2>
Fish farming in such environments, however, requires special
culture facilities that can withstand occasional strong wind and wave action.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#64:2>
Philip says that it is with this need that all-weather fish cages
from Norway, Denmark and the US have found their niche locally.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#65:2>
These imported cages are rated for five to seven-meter waves.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#66:2>
They have been so impressive that in two years, nearly a hundred
units have been brought to the country for growing <indig> <it> bangus </it>
</indig> mostly in Luzon and a few in the Visayas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#67:2>
Fish production in such cages has been very impressive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#68:2>
Depending on the size of the cage, fish operators usually harvest 20
to 50 tons per cropping of three to six months.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#69:2>
The big problem, however, is the fact that such all-weather fish
cages are very costly.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#70:2>
One cage, complete with nets and moorings, used to cost &peso;1
million before the devaluation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#71:2>
With the weaker peso, using the imported cages has become financially
unattractive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#72:2>
Philip, however, has come up with his own version of on
all-weather cage that is as good as the imported variety but costs only half.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#73:2>
Through his own research and development and with the generous
financial support of the Department of Science and Technology 's Technology
Application and Promotion Institute ( TAPI), he is now in the commercial
stage of his Aquaranch Seacage System. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#74:2>
Philip 's seacage is based on the tested and proven circular
polyethylene cage design from Europe now widely used worldwide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#75:2>
It is engineered based on local farming experience and conditions
employing Computer-Aided Design technology for optimum durability and
economy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#76:2>
Unlike the conventional rigid cages, Philip 's seacage utilizes
two concentric Ultraviolet ( UV)-stabilized polyethylene tubes as floats
which provide unparalleled flexibility and at the same time strength when
exposed to strong wind and wave action.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#77:2>
A four-point mooring system keeps the cage facility safely in place
even under harsh weather conditions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#78:2>
As an added safety precaution, all flotation tubes are foam-filled.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#79:2>
The stanchions of the seacages are made of stainless steel for
maintenance-free use.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#80:2>
It is designed, moreover, to be easily replaceable on-site should
future upgrades be desired.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#81:2>
The cage uses only knotless nylon which is more durable and less
abrasive to the cultured fish, Philip emphasizes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#82:2>
A special design also keeps the net fully open even under fairly
strong currents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#83:2>
A standard feature of Philip 's seacage is the automatic fish
feeder which is vital in ensuring rapid growth and efficient feed conversion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#84:2>
All critical raw materials used in the various components of the cage
system are imported and are specifically adapted to marine environments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#85:2>
His first two cages with a diameter of 15 meters have been
installed along the large channel separating Samal Island and Davao City.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#86:2>
With each cage having a water volume of about 1,200 cubic meters, a
stocking density of 60,000 is expected to yield 20 to 30 tons of fish per
cropping of three to six months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#87:2>
Aside from <indig> <it> bangus </it> </indig> , other species
could be cultured in Philip 's seacages.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#88:2>
These include <indig> <it> lapu-lapu </it> </indig> , salmon, trout,
bass ( <indig> <it> apahap </it> </indig> ) and blue-fin tuna.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#89:2>
In Taiwan, fish culturists are raising more than 50 species of marine
fishes in cages.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#90:2>
There 's no reason why it can't be done in the Philippines. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#91:2>
<h> <bold> Transporting the Mother <indig> Bangus </indig> Live
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#92:2>
<bold> Zac B. Sarian </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#93:2>
ONE of the problems in <indig> <it> bangus </it> </indig> culture
is the erratic supply of fry.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#94:2>
Sometimes the catch from the wild is plentiful and so there would be
no problem about fingerlings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#95:2>
But then there are times when, for one reason or another, there is no
source of fingerlings because the fry catch from the wild is insufficient.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#96:2>
The lack of fingerlings for stocking can be a big problem because
the cost could shoot up, and many of the fishponds could not be fully
utilized.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#97:2>
So much lost opportunity is incurred. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#98:2>
The solution being eyed is to produce the fingerlings in
laboratories or hatcheries so that the supply of fry could be assured
throughout the year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#99:2>
Well, the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center has for some
years now developed the technology to spawn the <indig> <it> bangus </it>
</indig> in captivity.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#100:2>
In fact, the center is already producing a limited number of
fingerlings in their hatchery in Tigbauan, Iloilo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#101:2>
The government has been keen in producing fingerlings in
captivity to ensure a steady supply of the same.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#102:2>
This way, year round <indig> <it> bangus </it> </indig> production
could be sustained for the benefit not only of fishpond operators but for the
general consuming public as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#103:2>
The problem has been in transporting live mother <indig> <it>
bangus </it> </indig> for breeding in the hatchery.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#104:2>
<indig> <it> Bangus </it> </indig> is a very sensitive fish.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#105:2>
Soon after it is caught from the water, it dies.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#106:2>
So, how do you transport the live fish to distant places? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#107:2>
There 's now a way to transport live <indig> <it> bangus </it>
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#108:2>
At the exhibit during the 10th anniversary of PCAMRD ( Philippine
Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development), we met Prof.
Virgilio A. Dureza of the UP Visayas College of Fisheries and fisheries
consultant Valeriano L. Corre, Jr. who updated us on their research regarding
the long distance transport of <indig> <it> bangus </it> </indig> broodstock.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#109:2>
The technology was actually adopted from Indonesia where <indig>
<it> bangus </it> </indig> fingerling production has become some kind of a
backyard industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#110:2>
A few years back, the Department of Science and Technology has
embarked on a global technology search, and one of the results is this one on
the transport of live adult <indig> <it> bangus </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#111:2>
Prof. Dureza, who explained to us the procedure, revealed that
in all their trials involving the transport of mature <indig> <it> bangus
</it> </indig> by boat and then through five to six hours of rough roads, the
survival of the fish was one hundred percent.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#112:2>
There was not a single mortality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#113:2>
In four different occasions, Corre and his colleagues
transported different batches of 25 to 105 pieces of <indig> <it> bangus
</it> </indig> , each weighing from 2.5 to 3 kilos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#114:2>
The fish came from the fishpond of Antonio de Sales in an island in
Aklan, so they had to be transported to the UP Visayas in Leganes, Iloilo, by
boat to the Panay mainland and then by cargo truck for five to six hours
through rough roads. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#115:2>
The transport of the live mother <indig> <it> bangus </it>
</indig> requires special attention which includes transporting during night
time, but this could be done as the researchers have proven. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#116:2>
Dureza and Corre said that before the milkfish broodstock from
the fishpond are caught for transporting, they are transferred to a supply
canal where they are held for at least one week without feeding.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#117:2>
Fish with empty stomach are less stressed during transport, they
explained. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#118:2>
The fish are scooped out of the holding canal and immersed in
water containing an anaesthetic to knock them out.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#119:2>
This facilitates handling and weighing of the fish.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#120:2>
The fish are then placed in a double plastic bag with pond water
containing anaesthesia which will keep the fish calm until they reach the
waiting truck in the main road. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#121:2>
The fish are transferred to a canvass tank installed in the
transport truck containing sea water to reduce the salinity to about 19 parts
per thousand.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#122:2>
About 15 to 52 kilos of live <indig> <it> bangus </it> </indig> may
be placed per cubic meter of water in the canvass tank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#123:2>
The water temperature in the canvass tank should also be lowered
to 26 degrees Celsius by adding crushed ice.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#124:2>
The water is checked every 30 minutes during transport so the
temperature could be adjusted accordingly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#125:2>
When the fish reach their destination after five to six hours,
they are transferred to a temporary holding tank where they are subjected to
an antibiotic bath for one to four hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#126:2>
Aeration is also maintained throughout the period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#127:2>
After that, the fish are scooped out from the temporary holding
tank and again anaesthetized.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#128:2>
They are again placed in a double plastic bag for their final
transport to the breeding pond, which in the case of their experiment, was
one kilometer away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#129:2>
At the pond site, the fish are taken out from the plastic bag
and held at swimming position in the pond water.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#130:2>
They are then held at the base of the caudal fin and swayed sideways
until they regain equilibrium.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#131:2>
This makes the fish ready for release, Dureza and Corre said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-033#132:2>
Surely, this new technology borrowed from Indonesia will go a
long way in ensuring the availability of <indig> <it> bangus </it> </indig>
fingerlings if the government or private sector will put it to good use. </p>
</I>
