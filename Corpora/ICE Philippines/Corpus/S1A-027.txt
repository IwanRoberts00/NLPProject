I like <indig> pero </indig> <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#201:1:A>
Uh okay uhm for me <,> I think my ideal guy should be passionate

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#202:1:B>
<{> <[> <indig> Ay </indig> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#203:1:A>
<[> You know </[> </{> yeah because because if he 's not passionate about something then how can he be passionate about me right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#204:1:B>
Passionate in the <.> se </.> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#205:1:A>
Yeah right and and what 's the most important thing is that <,> he should have love <,> <{> <[> lots </[> of love to give

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#206:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#207:1:A>
Because I mean love encompasses everything and

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#208:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#209:1:A>
And if he 's like and he 's like not educated or if he 's not if he 's not uhm good or if he 's not any any bad any bad attitude uhm I think <,> love is the catalyst that would make everybody change for the better right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#210:1:B>
Okay you 're right but for me even if such a even if a guy is educated he 's really good-looking and he he seems to be everything

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#211:1:A>
Uh yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#212:1:B>
A guy who doesn't love me for what and who I am is nothing <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#213:1:B>
And don't you think uhm both our concepts of an ideal man is is in this one song which goes something like uhm <&> starts singing </&> <quote> you 've got to

 <$A&$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#218:1:A>
<X> <quote> Don't love me for what you intend the hope that I might be if you 're only using me to feed your fantasy you 're really not in love so let me go I must be free </quote> </X> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#219:1:B>
It 's just so sad thinking that there 're only a few men left in this world who has all the qualities of an ideal man our ideal man

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#220:1:A>
Uhm actually I don't think that all that qualities you 're looking for

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#221:1:B>
Okay some <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#222:1:A>
Okay okay okay yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#223:1:A>
You know that 's true because times change people change and <,> it 's clich&eacute; but it 's true you know like change is constant part of our lives
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#224:1:A>
But you know since change is a <.> co </.> change is a constant thing I think <,> our concept of idealism or our concept of ideal man changes with the time or it just depends on the people

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#225:1:B>
You meet

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#226:1:A>
Yeah <,> yeah yeah yeah right and uh <,> but sometimes since we can't have our ideal man we have to like not I 'm not going to say settle for what you have because because I think that 's really crap

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#227:1:B>
That 's crap

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#228:1:A>
That 's crap that 's uh it 's really crappy thing to say

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#229:1:B>
But don't you think if you 're if you 're like with this special someone

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#230:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#231:1:B>
If it even if he has he does not have

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#232:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#233:1:B>
The ideal qualities you you want in a guy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#234:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#235:1:B>
You just have I think you just have to recognize the qualities the best qualities that he has and you just thank <,> <{> <[> thank </[> God for it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#236:1:A>
<[> God </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#237:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#238:1:B>
'Cause the mere fact that he loves you it 's something <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-027#239:1:A>
Of course of course I mean just uh just like what you said before I mean there 's good side and a bad side in everyone of us right and that I mean ideal ideal man or the the cause of ideal man really really depends on the person himself right
