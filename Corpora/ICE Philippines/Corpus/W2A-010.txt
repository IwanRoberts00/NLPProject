<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#3:1>
An observer in the Bikol region will immediately note the
closeness of ties between daily life and song among the people.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#4:1>
The folk sing at work, while resting, at play and in worship.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#5:1>
They sing when they are happy, when they are disappointed or
heartbroken, when they are afraid, and when they are penitent.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#6:1>
They sing to their babies, the older children, to their lovers, their
parents, to God and the saints.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#7:1>
There are songs sung before dawn, during the day, in the evening and
at midnight.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#8:1>
There is a vast and varied repertoire of melodies and lyrics upon
which the people draw for songs to suit both occasion and purpose for which
singing is appropriate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#9:1>
One may be awakened long before dawn by the plaintive strains of
the <it> <foreign> despierta </foreign> </it> , a community procession around
the village calling on all Christians to awaken and start the day with
prayer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#10:1>
Throughout the day, as the household goes about its routinary chores
and activities, one may hear snatches of a tender <it> <indig> panhimaturog
</indig> </it> or lullaby as a mother cradles the baby in her arms,
rhythmical <it> <indig> pakonsuelo </indig> </it> sung by <indig> Lolo
</indig> or <indig> Lola </indig> to amuse the children, and a sad <it>
<indig> logo-logo </indig> </it> or song of disappointment and
world-weariness as a mother busies herself in the kitchen, mends clothes or
weaves a hat when housework is done. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#11:1>
The chatter of the older children in the yard may be punctuated
by their play songs or <it> <indig> kanta sa pag-uyag </indig> </it> to
accompany a game, to tease one another, or simply to liven up their
story-telling.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#12:1>
They may choose to sit outside the window of the house while a
mother, an unmarried aunt, or a grandmother, now resting from housework,
reads from a little torn booklet and sings of far-away adventures and
romances of the <it> <foreign> berso </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#13:1>
Out in the ricefields, in a coconut or <indig> abaca </indig>
plantation, the doleful tune of a <it> <indig> tagulaylay </indig> </it> may
be heard as the men rest from their labors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#14:1>
At day 's end when work is done, the adult men and women may
gather informally at the neighborhood <indig> sari-sari </indig> store or
someone 's little terrace and, over jugs of <indig> tuba </indig> , exchange
lighthearted songs, the <it> <indig> pakonsuelo </indig> </it> , in praise of
drink or on the follies of men and women, or entertain each other through
<it> <foreign> inamoracion </foreign> </it> or love songs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#15:1>
When there is news that a young woman has recently come to visit in
the barrio, the young men may, in the later hours of the evening, fetch the
local <it> <foreign> gitarista </foreign> </it> and call on the maiden guest
in a <it> <indig> harana </indig> </it> or serenade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#16:1>
On weekend nights, a village dance may be organized and there
couples may dance the <it> <foreign> pantomina </foreign> </it> to the
lilting melodies sung by the recognized singers of the community.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#17:1>
To provide the dancers some rest and to serve as an intermission of
sorts, a <it> <indig> sumpungan </indig> </it> may be held where a man and a
woman engage in a lively courtship debate in song. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#18:1>
The image of the Bikolanos as merrymakers is balanced by their
seriousness in worship.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#19:1>
On more quiet evenings, especially when the community has lately been
beset by some misfortune, the people may join a late evening or midnight <it>
<foreign> perdon </foreign> </it> , a haunting penitential procession asking
for divine intercession. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#20:1>
At Christmastime, the homes of the barrio may be visited at night
by itinerant bands of carolers singing the <it> <indig> Kagharong </indig>
</it> , recounting Joseph and Mary 's pitiable search for a room at the inn.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#21:1>
In the daytime, small groups of boys and girls colorfully dressed as
<it> <foreign> pastoras </foreign> </it> may make the rounds of the big
houses and neighborhood stores in town singing and dancing in celebration of
the Nativity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#22:1>
Hence, we see that folksinging in the region happens under a host
of diverse conditions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#23:1>
The folk sing their songs in a variety of social situations and
settings, with a variety of singers and for a variety of purposes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#24:1>
However diverse these conditions are, the folk implicitly know which
song and which singing style accompany which purpose, which occasion, which
physical setting, which time of day, which type of singer or singers and
audience, and other such elements which broadly speaking, constitute the
folksinging context.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#25:1>
Complementarily, the folk also know which elements do not properly
match or combine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#26:1>
Take the case of young and unmarried men ( participants) trying
to get acquainted with a young woman visiting the barrio ( purpose).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#27:1>
They serenade her at the home of her host ( physical setting) in the
late hours of the evening ( time of day).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#28:1>
The folk singers select love songs ( text) from their repertoire of
song and sing them with tenderness ( key) to the rhythm of a guitar ( musical
instrument).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#29:1>
This behavior may be seen as the product of a set of choices made by
a participant with a purpose, on an activity which involves physical and
temporal setting, text, key, and musical instrument.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#30:1>
The nature and the outcome of the activity rest on the propriety of
the choices made on all items in the set.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#31:1>
Improper choices made on any one of these elements can lead to
unwanted result and thwart any hoped-for outcome of the activity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#32:1>
Changing the time of day to noontime ( <X> <quote> <indig> &ldquo;
Masyado naman yata kayong maaga. &rdquo; </indig> </quote> </X> ) , trotting
out a small drum improvised from a milk tin instead of a guitar ( <X> <quote>
<indig> &ldquo; Malayo pa ang Pasko! &rdquo; </indig> </quote> </X> ) , or
selecting <it> <indig> Tilibong, Tilibong </indig> </it> instead of a love
song ( <X> <quote> <indig> &ldquo; Kami ba'y niloloko ninyo? &rdquo; </indig>
</quote> </X> ) are examples of inappropriate choices and of unwished-for
reactions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#33:1>
The young men may draw laughter, derision, or perhaps pity but
probably not an invitation to come up and meet the young woman guest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#34:1>
But had the participants been children, the time of day earlier
in the evening, the month December, the purpose to earn a few pesos, the key
jubilant, then the milk tin for a drum would have been the appropriate choice
of musical instrument to accompany songs on the Infant Jesus.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#35:1>
This altered configuration of elements would have defined the
activity to be Christmas caroling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#36:1>
These examples of appropriate and inappropriate behavior indicate
that folksinging is not merely the act of singing songs transmitted over time
but rather a complex activity involving a &ldquo; correct &rdquo; text,
context, participants and performance and a &ldquo; correct &rdquo;
combination of these elements.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#37:1>
It is a form of behavior involving choices on these components which
are made, often unconsciously, by the folk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#38:1>
Broadly defined, folk songs are the songs of, for, and by the
folk which is <quote> &ldquo; any group of people whatsoever who share at
least one common factor ( such as) occupation, language or religion &rdquo;
</quote> ( Dundes 1965: 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#39:1>
These are the melodies and lyrics as well as their performance which
are created and/or recreated by the folk, performed primarily by and among
themselves to accompany the daily life of the community, and expressive of a
meaningful personal or social or group experience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#40:1>
The specific defining characteristics of folk songs are communal
recreation, variation, aural transmission <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> and
performance in small groups.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#41:1>
Communal recreation is the basic element which distinguishes folk
songs from other types of songs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#42:1>
While originally composed by individuals, folk songs have been and
are acted on, re-created and re-fashioned by the community in a process of
purposeful selection and adaptation, unlike popular songs which are taken
over ready-made by them.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#43:1>
Thus folk songs are truly a communal product and possession. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#44:1>
Consequently, they exist only as variants of the original
compositions whose melodies and/or lyrics, together with their authors, are
now perhaps forgotten.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#45:1>
While popular songs are congealed in form, folk songs invite
variation in their tunes and their words. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#46:1>
The fluidity of the folk songs is partly due to their manner of
transmission, that is, without a musical score.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#47:1>
They are learned, performed from memory, and transmitted aurally from
one generation to the next and diffused from one region to another.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#48:1>
As one peasant-folksinger in Sorsogon describes their performance,
folk songs are sung and accompanied by a guitar set to <quote> &ldquo; the
key of O, <foreign> oido </foreign> . &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#49:1>
Finally, like other folklore forms, folk songs are performed
primarily in small groups where the participants relate to each other
directly, face-to-face ( Ben-Amos 1971: 12-13), in contrast to popular songs
which are played live to a mass audience in music halls or as recordings over
the radio and on television.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#50:1>
Moreover, they are performed to accompany the day-to-day activities
of the folk in work, play, and worship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#51:1>
As for content, folk songs are one channel where the folk speak
directly of their world, thought and spirit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#52:1>
Thus has the folk song been defined in terms of its properties as
folk music and as verbal folklore.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#53:1>
However, the folk song is not only these.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#54:1>
Beyond its specific defining characteristics enumerated by
musicologists and folklorists, the folk song may also be seen as a peculiar
form of language use for communication.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#55:1>
It has a distinctly recognizable stylistic form, talks about
distinctly familiar topics, is performed in a distinctly different way from
other language acts, under distinctive conventional settings of time and
place, and for distinctive purposes by and among the folk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#56:1>
As such it may be considered a speech genre which has
distinguishing properties of text, context and performance <foreign>
vis-&agrave;-vis </foreign> other genres, each of which calls for a different
manner of conduct and relies on different norms of interpretation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#57:1>
The ethnography of speaking the Bikol folk song is a description
and analysis of its text, context and performance and the shared conventions
governing its conduct and interpretation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#58:1>
It is a description and analysis of the rules governing the use of
the folk song in the Bikol region, the rules and conventions governing its
form, its doing and performance, and setting which are intimately related to
the rules governing its means of interpretation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#59:1>
There are shared conventions that distinguish it from other
nonfolklore communicative modes, that is, through its text, its conduct or
performance, and the situation where it may be found. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#60:1>
To produce, comprehend and use <quote> &ldquo; correct and
well-formed, contextually appropriate &rdquo; </quote> folk songs, the folk
draw on what might be termed their folksinging competence, an implicit
knowledge of the rules and conventions involving the text, performance and
context of this verbal art. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#61:1>
It may be said that every folksinging performance is a
manifestation of this folksinging competence.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#62:1>
It involves knowing what to sing, when, where, how and why.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#63:1>
It involves for the folk who sing and re-create folk songs a
competence that goes beyond the grammatical rules of the language of the
songs but also encompasses three other requisite aspects.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#64:1>
These are knowing the conventions of the folk song genre as a
stylized form of speech, knowing the rules of &ldquo; reading &rdquo; the
folk song correctly, and knowing the rules of folk song use.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#65:1>
To elaborate:

<p> 1. <h> <bold> knowing the conventions of the folk song as a stylized form
of speech </bold> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#66:1>
It is this knowledge which enables the folk to create and re-create
versions of the folk song and to express their thoughts in recognizable form.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#67:1>
It is this knowledge that gives the folk such confidence and boldness
in &ldquo; taking liberties &rdquo; with the folk song and creating their own
versions in innumerable instances.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#68:1>
Folksinging competence involves an implicit knowledge of the rules of
text construction, including the folk 's repertoire of topics or messages as
well as resources of linguistic and musical devices for making the lyrics
cohere and the melodies and lyrics match.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#69:1>
Such competence has been observed by folklorists: <O> quotation </O>
</p>

<p> 2. <h> <bold> knowing the rules of &ldquo; reading &rdquo; the folk song
correctly </bold> </h> , in the adapted sense of Jonathan Culler 's &ldquo;
literary competence": the often unconscious system of rules by which readers
associate not just any arbitrary meaning but rather a range of acceptable or
appropriate meanings to a stream or body of utterances in a particular form,
that is, the literary piece ( 1975: 113-130).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#70:1>
Folksinging competence includes the ability to associate an
acceptable meaning or range of meanings with a folk song as mediated by the
folk song setting.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#71:1>
It is this competence which allows the folk, for example, to decode
sexual undertones and otherwise taboo references in folk songs which, when
written down and read, look innocuous enough for children 's ears.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#72:1>
When sung in a riotous drinking session by the community 's adults,
however, such innuendoes come to the fore and elicit the desired howls of
laughter and token protest.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#73:1>
To &ldquo; read &rdquo; the folk song correctly, the folk have their
ability to recognize and pick up clues provided by its context, both
immediate and remote, and thus decode messages. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#74:1>
A folk song 's immediate context or its &ldquo; context of
situation &rdquo; are those elements which accompany its performance such as
the participants, setting, manner of interaction between singer and audience,
and key or tone of performance.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#75:1>
The remote context refers to what is called <mention> &ldquo; context
of culture &rdquo; </mention> , the material and non-material elements which
make up the world of the folk as well as their outlook towards it, their
ideas, beliefs, concerns, attitudes and values.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-010#76:1>
The ideal folk song singer/listener brings this broad knowledge and
outlook into the folksinging event so that the folk song is encoded and
decoded according to the shared rules of interpretation. </p> </I>
