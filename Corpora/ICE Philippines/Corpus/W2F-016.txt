<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#3:1>
The bus sped on through the April afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#4:1>
Houses and trees went by in dirty browns and deep greens.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#5:1>
The people were less preoccupied and moved slowly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#6:1>
Like animated statues, Miguel thought.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#7:1>
He smiled, amused by the comparison. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#8:1>
A love song was playing on the radio.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#9:1>
The humming of the engine and the song merged with his thoughts, the
soundtrack of the movie outside his window, one that he hadn't seen in a very
long time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#10:1>
Everyone on the bus seemed enclosed in a meditative silence, and the
delirious chattering that had irritated him before was gone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#11:1>
The wind was getting cold.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#12:1>
Miguel settled back in his seat, closed the window and closed his
eyes. </p>

<p> <it>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#13:1>
It was all so sudden.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#14:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I have to go Miguel, &rdquo; </quote> she said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#15:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There are a lot of good job opportunities in the
city.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#16:1>
I want the fast-paced life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#17:1>
I want to ride cars, dine in hotels, and see all the bright lights.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#18:1>
Mr. Valdez promised me these.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#19:1>
I need this chance, Miguel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#20:1>
Please understand. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#21:1>
Miguel held her hand tightly, trying to get a share of its warmth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#22:1>
He forced a smile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#23:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Promise me you 'll come back, &rdquo; </quote> he
said, and the bus took her away, leaving only the echo of the sputtering
engine. </it> </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#24:1>
<quote> &ldquo; San Vicente! &rdquo; </quote> the conductor
shouted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#25:1>
Miguel got off and looked around.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#26:1>
The old road has been paved and there were new concrete houses lining
the highway.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#27:1>
He looked at all of them with vague familiarity.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#28:1>
Nothing much changes here, he thought finally, seeing the old faces
behind the new gates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#29:1>
Although the light was fading, Miguel could see the old house
that stood solitary among the mango trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#30:1>
Miguel began walking faster.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#31:1>
His two heavy bags felt lighter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#32:1>
As he passed under the towering trees, the wind carried the scent
to him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#33:1>
He stopped for a moment and tried to remember.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#34:1>
It was a memory the city had taken from him in the seven years that
had passed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#35:1>
<quote> Seven years, </quote> Miguel whispered to himself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#36:1>
The orange tint of dusk highlighted the rusty wooden gate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#37:1>
It gave out a loud creak when he pushed it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#38:1>
The shadows cast by the <indig> lanzones </indig> trees in the yard
were lengthening, touching the terrace of Miguel 's house. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#39:1>
Juanito saw him first.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#40:1>
Miguel had just stepped into the yard. </p>

<p> <quote> &ldquo; <indig> Kuya </indig> ! &rdquo; </quote> Juanito shouted,
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> Nanay </indig> , <indig> Kuya </indig> 's here,
<indig> Kuya </indig> 's here! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#41:1>
Juanito ran to him laughing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#42:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Hey, you 've really grown! &rdquo; </quote> Miguel
said, patting his brother on the shoulders.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#43:1>
The last time he saw him, Juanito was just four years old. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#44:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 've been helping on the farm, <indig> kuya
</indig> , &rdquo; </quote> Juanito said, his husky voice sounding strange to
Miguel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#45:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> Tiyo </indig> Peping said I 'm old enough to
cut the coffee shoots.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#46:1>
You should visit the farm, everyone 's talking about a good harvest
this year. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#47:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Sure 'Nito, but one thing at a time, &rdquo;
</quote> Miguel answered with a mild chuckle.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#48:1>
Aling Nena was standing at the door.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#49:1>
She was half-smiling; for a moment, Miguel thought she was happy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#50:1>
Then he saw the numerous lines on her forehead. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#51:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> Nay </indig> ... how are you? &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#52:1>
<indig> Aling </indig> Nena hugged him silently.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#53:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I thought you wouldn't come back anymore, &rdquo;
</quote> she finally said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#54:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I thought you 'd forgotten that there is life outside
the city. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#55:1>
She 's right, he told himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#56:1>
For the past seven years, he did not come home.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#57:1>
He just let them know how he was doing through letters and postcards.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#58:1>
Thrice a year at first, then once every six months.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#59:1>
But Miguel knew he had enough reason to stay away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#60:1>
He couldn't endure waiting. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#61:1>
<indig> Mang </indig> Peping was very talkative at the dinner
table.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#62:1>
He kept lecturing to Miguel about staying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#63:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Besides, &rdquo; </quote> he said, <quote>
&ldquo; what can the city give you but noise and smoke?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#64:1>
Here, everything is fresh and the air is good! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#65:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Peping, don't give your sermon while eating.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#66:1>
Miguel may lose his appetite, &rdquo; </quote> his wife <indig> Aling
</indig> Letty said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#67:1>
Miguel smiled but did not speak.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#68:1>
He didn't want to discuss the reason for his return. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#69:1>
He continued chewing, then managed to respond weakly, <quote>
&ldquo; It 's good to be back. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#70:1>
Across the table, <indig> Aling </indig> Nena was staring at him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#71:1>
Miguel knew she could feel the uncertainty in his voice. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#72:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Your <indig> Tiyo </indig> Peping is a great help
on the farm, &rdquo; </quote> <indig> Aling </indig> Nena told him while
fixing his bed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#73:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Juanito also loves the farm.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#74:1>
He is turning out to be a hardworking boy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#75:1>
Now, a good harvest is coming up and, well, we could use an extra
hand. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#76:1>
Miguel didn't know what to say.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#77:1>
His father lived and died caring for the farm.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#78:1>
But Miguel didn't want to be a farmer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#79:1>
He wanted a different life, the city life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#80:1>
Miguel knew his helping on the farm would really make a difference,
but he was determined to keep his job in the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#81:1>
He had worked hard to become assistant manager of the textile
company. ... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#82:1>
I could not give it up, he convinced himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#83:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'll think about it, <indig> 'Nay </indig> , &rdquo;
</quote> he replied.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#84:1>
<indig> Aling </indig> Nena sighed and was silent. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#85:1>
It was already very quiet outside, save for the noise of
crickets.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#86:1>
Tomorrow I 'll find out, he thought.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#87:1>
He closed his eyes and the scent came to him once more.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#88:1>
He realized he still could not remember what it was, where it came
from.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#89:1>
It was all around him, filling the room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#90:1>
Disturbed by the fragrance, he found it hard to fall asleep. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#91:1>
<it> The moment Miguel received his graduation diploma, he made
up his mind that he wanted to go to the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#92:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I want to go to college, <indig> 'Nay </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#93:1>
I 'm sure that 's what father would want for me. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#94:1>
<indig> Aling </indig> Nena was crying.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#95:1>
She knew that if it wasn't for the scholarship, she could not afford
to send Miguel there.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#96:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Of course, &rdquo; </quote> she answered, <quote>
&ldquo; you 're big enough to decide for yourself." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#97:1>
Miguel hugged her with joy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#98:1>
In his mind, he was not really thinking of college.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#99:1>
Soon I will be with her, he thought.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#100:1>
Soon </it> . </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#101:1>
Miguel woke up early.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#102:1>
He wanted to visit some old friends, he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#103:1>
Before he could go, he was made to eat breakfast specially prepared
by his mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#104:1>
He declined his brother and <indig> Tiyo </indig> Peping 's
invitation to visit the farm.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#105:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Later, I promise, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#106:1>
On the <indig> jeepney </indig> heading for town, he completely
forgot about them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#107:1>
In his thoughts, there was no one but her. </p>

<p> Miguel sighed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#108:1>
He smiled at the thought that she may not recognize him anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#109:1>
His hands came up to his well-combed hair and his eyes darted to his
neatly ironed slacks and leather shoes.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#110:1>
Fit for a manager, he thought. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#111:1>
He recalled her beautiful laughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#112:1>
To his dismay, he did not find it in the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#113:1>
Some friends told him she had already gone abroad with a boyfriend.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#114:1>
Others said she was staying with Mr. Valdez, the talent scout who
had brought her to the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#115:1>
Miguel was heartbroken.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#116:1>
At first, he wanted to escape back to the province, to forget the
city and its bright lights.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#117:1>
But he knew deep within that this would be the cowardly thing to do.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#118:1>
He saw his mother 's disappointed face and heard the girl 's mocking
laughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#119:1>
As the uncertain days passed, Miguel realized he could draw strength
from that laughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#120:1>
Bitterness drove him onward. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#121:1>
He focused his mind on his studies.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#122:1>
He worked hard and got good grades, even making it to the honor
roll.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#123:1>
Slowly, the thought of going back home left his mind.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#124:1>
The truth of the city became his truth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#125:1>
The province was the lie, the pain he thought he wouldn't be able to
face again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#126:1>
After his graduation, he stayed in the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#127:1>
He had a great start in his career - - he found a good job and met
Cecilia, a hardworking colleague.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#128:1>
Soon, they began dating.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#129:1>
A relationship emerged and Miguel was happy.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#130:1>
He thought he had completely forgotten about her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#131:1>
Until the day Cecilia talked about marriage.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#132:1>
It was then that he decided to go back. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#133:1>
Hesitantly, Miguel knocked on the door.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#134:1>
An elderly woman opened it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#135:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> Aling </indig> Tinay, it 's me, Miguel.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#136:1>
The woman peered at him, her grayish eyebrows meeting, then gave
him a big smile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#137:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Oh, Miguel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#138:1>
Of course, I remember you!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#139:1>
Come in, come in! &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#140:1>
She beckoned, offering him a seat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#141:1>
Miguel sat down and began, <quote> &ldquo; It 's about your
daughter. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#142:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Oh, &rdquo; </quote> Aling Tinay answered
weakly, leaving the word hanging for a while. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#143:1>
<it> <quote> She did not return, Miguel.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#144:1>
After she left, she only wrote to us twice--when she told us she was
going to the U.S. with a friend, and when she announced she was going to get
married.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#145:1>
Well, I just hope she 's happy out there.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#146:1>
I think she forgot about us.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#147:1>
She did not even tell us the address. ... </quote> </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#148:1>
Miguel walked in silence.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#149:1>
The sun was already low, bringing a soft light around him and making
silhouettes of the coconut trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#150:1>
The air was growing colder and it carried the scent to him once
more.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#151:1>
It was all around him, merging with his thoughts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#152:1>
He searched his heart for the great feeling of loss, the one he
had felt the day she left.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#153:1>
He searched for the fear, which had kept him away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#154:1>
It surprised him that they weren't there anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#155:1>
Sometime during the past seven years, he had unknowingly accepted
the loss, and, as he vividly remembered the smiling eyes of Cecilia, he knew
when. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#156:1>
Juanito confronted him as he came in through the gate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#157:1>
<quote> &ldquo; <indig> Kuya </indig> , you said you were coming to
the farm with me. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#158:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'm sorry Juanito, I forgot, &rdquo; </quote>
Miguel replied, <quote> &ldquo; I guess I lost track of the time. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#159:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But it 's not evening yet, &rdquo; </quote> the
boy insisted.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#160:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Besides, the moon will be bright tonight.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#161:1>
Let 's go.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#162:1>
I 'm sure you 'll like it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#163:1>
You 'll see how big and beautiful our coffee plants are now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#164:1>
Remember?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#165:1>
Nanay said you even planted some of them yourself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#166:1>
Come on, you promised. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#167:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Well, okay, 'Nito, &rdquo; </quote> Miguel said
with a chuckle, <quote> &ldquo; I 'd like to see my plants. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#168:1>
A light breeze brought the scent to Miguel once more, stronger
this time, and sweeter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#169:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Will you be staying for the harvest, <indig>
kuya </indig> ? &rdquo; </quote> Juanito asked.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#170:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There are many flowers this year.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#171:1>
<indig> Tiyo </indig> Peping said it 's a good sign. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#172:1>
Miguel 's face lit up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#173:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's the flowers--right!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#174:1>
The flowers! &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#175:1>
All of a sudden, he found himself running: up the hill, over the
soft <indig> carabao </indig> grass, under the coconut trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#176:1>
When he stopped, he found himself facing a thousand coffee
plants--their flowers all in full bloom.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#177:1>
Before Miguel was a vast expanse of clear whiteness, of purity,
shining like pearls in the late afternoon sunlight.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#178:1>
Shaking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#179:1>
He was laughing when Juanito caught up with him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#180:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Why did you run? &rdquo; </quote> Juanito asked,
panting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#181:1>
Miguel placed his arms on his brother 's shoulders and answered,
<quote> &ldquo; Nothing, really.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#182:1>
I.... &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#183:1>
He shifted his gaze towards the blooming coffee field anew and took
in a big gulp of the sweet air, <quote> &ldquo; I just didn't realize I could
miss anything so much. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#184:1>
Juanito looked questioningly at Miguel 's smiling face and
shrugged.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#185:1>
The next moment, he was running towards the coffee field, chased by
Miguel 's crisp, almost childish, laughter. </p> ***

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#186:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I have an announcement to make, &rdquo; </quote>
Miguel said during dinner.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#187:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 've decided to go back to the city tomorrow.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#188:1>
<indig> Mang </indig> Peping and <indig> Aling </indig> Letty
looked at him in genuine surprise.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#189:1>
Juanito sighed aloud and started to protest.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#190:1>
<indig> Aling </indig> Nena 's eyes were on her food. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-016#191:1>
