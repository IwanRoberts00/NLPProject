<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#3:1>
It may have blinked in the &peso;25.27-billion tax evasion suit
against Fortune Tobacco Corp., its officials and nine alleged dummy firms,
but the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR) said it is bent on having the
Supreme Court indict the cigarette manufacturer for failing to pay a
&peso;30.9-million, four-year deficiency tax. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#4:1>
In a four-page motion obtained by <it> <mention> Business World
</mention> </it> , BIR commissioner Beethoven Rualo last week asked the High
Tribunal for a 30-day extension to appeal an earlier dismissal by the Court
of Appeals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#5:1>
<quote> &ldquo; ( I) am not in conformity with the ( Court of
Appeals ' ) decision and resolution and intends to appeal therefrom, &rdquo;
</quote> said Mr. Rualo, through the bureau 's litigation and prosecution
division chief Osias Baldivino. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#6:1>
The case, which involves Fortune Tobacco 's alleged non-payment of
excise taxes on the importation of stemmed leaf tobacco for four years, was
dismissed last January by the appellate court.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#7:1>
Last month, the Internal Revenue 's motion for reconsideration was
likewise junked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#8:1>
Court rules allow an aggrieved party to go to the High Court
within 15 days from receipt of an unfavorable decision.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#9:1>
BIR had until last Wednesday to file its petition for review. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#10:1>
The BIR 's persistence to pursue the tax deficiency suit covering
1986 to 1990 was a far cry from its action on the nine counts of tax evasion
it earlier slapped against Fortune Tobacco, its marketing companies, and 70
executives, including beer and tobacco magnate Lucio Tan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#11:1>
In a hearing last Friday, the BIR formally asked Marikina
Metropolitan Trial Court judge Alex Ruiz to dismiss the &ldquo; most
controversial case &rdquo; due to lack of evidence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#12:1>
Mr. Ruiz chided the BIR for failing to confer with the Justice
department, which filed the criminal case, before submitting the motion.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#13:1>
He ordered the BIR and the DoJ prosecution panel, led by senior state
prosecutor Paulita Villarante, to meet and decide whether or not the case
should be withdrawn. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#14:1>
The next hearing was set on Jan. 15. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#15:1>
If the Supreme Court decides in favor of the government in the
civil case set to be appealed, the BIR stands to collect a measly 1/100 of 1%
of the amount it could add up to government coffers if it pursues the
&peso;25.27-billion tax fraud case. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#16:1>
Moreover, the case is civil in nature, thus, Fortune Tobacco
officials liable for the non-payment, will not serve any jail term. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#17:1>
Former Solicitor General Estelito Mendoza, Fortune Tobacco 's
counsel, refused to comment on the latest BIR move, saying he will wait for
the High Court 's order to comment on the case, if such will not be dismissed
outright. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#18:1>
In its 24-page decision promulgated last January, the 17th
division dismissed BIR 's petition seeking the payment of &peso;309 million
in excise taxes on the firm 's imported leaf tobacco, ruling the BIR
effectively usurped Congress ' law-making power in making the demand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#19:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Only Congress, not the BIR, can provide for
additional taxes ...

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#20:1>
It is arrogating powers to itself which it does not possess, &rdquo;
</quote> said associate justice Corona Ibay-Somera, who penned the decision.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#21:1>
The ruling was concurred by associate justices Oswaldo Agcaoili and
Rodrigo Cosico. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#22:1>
The BIR then asked the appellate court to uphold its power to
levy a &peso;0.75 per kilo of stemmed leaf, as provided in its Revenue
Regulations No. 17-67.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#23:1>
It added stemmed leaf was reclassified by the BIR commissioner so it
can be subject to excise tax. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#24:1>
Fortune Tobacco said the product is already subject to specific
tax under the Tax Code. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#25:1>
In ruling in favor of the cigarette manufacturer, the Court of
Appeals said the BIR commissioner <quote> &ldquo; has gone into unauthorized
amendment of the law &rdquo; </quote> and not merely in interpretation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#26:1>
On appeal, which was set aside on Nov. 13, the BIR insisted there
is <quote> &ldquo; no double taxation in the prohibited sense. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#27:1>
The BIR is expected to elevate the case to the Supreme Court by
Jan. 8. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#28:1>
In a related development, the DoJ prosecution panel handling the
&peso;25.27-billion tax case said Mr. Ruiz, presiding judge of the Marikina
MTC Branch 75, should not wait until next year to issue warrants of arrest
against the 70 accused, including Mr. Tan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#29:1>
The prosecution team asked Mr. Ruiz last Friday to <quote>
&ldquo; immediately &rdquo; </quote> issue arrest warrants against the nine
Fortune Tobacco officials and 61 executives of its nine marketing arms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The opposition ( of the accused) constitutes
obstruction of justice since the only evident purpose thereof is to
deliberately delay the proceedings, &rdquo; </quote> the DoJ said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#31:1>
Mr. Mendoza asked the lower court last Dec. 3 not to issue any
warrant, considering the tax case <quote> &ldquo; has no leg to stand on.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#32:1>
He said the BIR 's withdrawal from the case should be the basis
for its dismissal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#33:1>
The DoJ said Mr. Mendoza 's opposition to the issuance of
warrants was highly improper.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#34:1>
It said Fortune Tobacco officials should have awaited the service of
warrants before filing an opposition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#35:1>
However, Mr. Ruiz effectively allowed all the accused to go
scot-free, at least until Jan. 15. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#36:1>
He said much as he would like to grant both parties ' motion to
resolve the issuance of the arrest warrants, the court has to suspend
proceedings to give way to its yearly case inventory. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> C&P Homes eyes property swap to settle &peso;5-B debt
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#38:2>
<bold> Noel G. Reyes </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#39:2>
C&P Homes, Inc., the country 's leading developer of low-cost
housing founded and still majority-owned by House Speaker Manuel B. Villar,
has sent feelers to its creditors it wants to enter into a <foreign> <it>
dacion en pago </it> </foreign> agreement covering around &peso;5 billion of
its &peso;8.75 billion in short-term debt, industry sources said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#40:2>
But most of the creditor banks of C&P Homes interviewed by
<mention> <it> Business World </it> </mention> yesterday are against the
housing developer 's plan to place &peso;5 billion in short-term debts under
a <foreign> <it> dacion en pago </it> </foreign> deal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#41:2>
A top official of one of the banks, on condition of anonymity,
said C&P Homes ' plan has been known to most banks as early as four to five
months ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#42:2>
However, he said the housing firm was insisting on covering all
of its &peso;16-billion exposure at the time under the agreement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#43:2>
Banks opposed the proposal, not wanting the Villar-owned company
to dictate the valuation of its assets that will cover the debts.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#44:2>
<quote> &ldquo; There 's a big possibility that it will inflate its
assets, &rdquo; </quote> another top official of a creditor said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#45:2>
In its current form, the proposed settlement will leave creditors
holding another &peso;9.6 billion of the company 's long-term debt, including
&dollar;150 million in floating rate notes ( FRNs), in a predicament,
financial analysts said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#46:2>
Under a <foreign> <it> dacion en pago </it> </foreign> deal, the
lender and the borrower agree to settle a debt with assets, normally real
estate and other properties.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#47:2>
Such payment in kind eliminates the need for costly foreclosure
proceedings in court. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#48:2>
<mention> <it> Business World </it> </mention> tried but could
not get a statement from C&P Homes whose officials were yesterday either
<quote> &ldquo; out of the country," </quote> <quote> &ldquo; unavailable
&rdquo; </quote> or <quote> &ldquo; attending a meeting." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#49:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Bankers were panicky" </quote> upon learning of
the plan, said a local fund manager who last Wednesday attended a bondholders
meeting called by Far East Bank and Trust Co. ( FEBTC), which acts as trustee
for C&P Homes ' &peso;3-billion long-term commercial paper due in 2001 and
2003. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#50:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Far East Bank is resigned to the fact that ( C&P
Homes) will soon not be able to service the interest payment on the debt
&rdquo; </quote> although it has so far been current on its debts service
payments, said the fund manager.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#51:2>
Needless to say, <quote> &ldquo; if they can't pay the interest, what
more the principal? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#52:2>
Unfortunately for the creditors, added an equity analyst with a
foreign brokerage house, just about all the company 's debts were granted on
a &ldquo; clean loan &rdquo; basis, or without any collateral. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#53:2>
<quote> &ldquo; This was the time when Manny Villar and C&P still
had sweet-smelling names and everybody was falling over themselves trying to
lend to them, &rdquo; </quote> the analyst said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#54:2>
Those days are now long gone.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#55:2>
For the first nine months of the year, C&P Homes reported a 77%
decline in net income to &peso;251 million, earning a measly &peso;37 million
on sales of &peso;786 million in the third quarter alone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#56:2>
More worrisome, its cash levels as of end of the third quarter,
according to the company 's financial statement, plunged 87% to &peso;436
million after it recorded an operational cash outflow of &peso;2.9 billion in
the period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#57:2>
When compared with its annual interest expense of between
&peso;2.0 billion and &peso;2.5 billion, its remaining cash hoard becomes
wholly inadequate, analysts say. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#58:2>
Deterioration in its business operations may also be seen in the
17% expansion of its receivables to almost &peso;15 billion despite a 52%
drop in revenues to &peso;22 billion in the January-September period. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#59:2>
<h> <bold> PROBLEMATIC </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#60:2>
The huge receivables account, equivalent to almost 43% of total
assets, has become problematic not only for the company and its creditors,
but also to its external auditor, SyCip, Gorres & Velayo & Co. ( SGV). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#61:2>
The auditors noted that prior to June 1996, the company 's
operating subsidiaries used to deal with the National Home Mortgage Finance
Corp. ( NHMFC), wherein the latter would purchase the subsidiaries ' housing
loans and contracts receivables as provided for under the government 's
Unified Home Lending Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#62:2>
However, when the program was taken over by the Home Development
Mutual Fund ( <indig> PAG-IBIG </indig> ) in 1996, it strictly imposed the
housing loan agreements.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#63:2>
In particular, it required a redocumentation process that included
certificates of loan eligibility, loan counselling for the lot buyers, and
collateral appraisal reports all of which prolonged the mortgage take-out
period from an average of six months to about 12 to 15 months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#64:2>
Last Feb. 20, 1998, the <indig> PAG-IBIG </indig> Fund issued
Circular No. 159 which, among others, required that the loan account applied
by companies such as C&P Homes have collection efficiency ( CE) of at least
80% <quote> &ldquo; and to increase gradually to the desired rate of 97%
whenever appropriate. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#65:2>
Should the CE fall below the minimum, <indig> PAG-IBIG </indig>
will suspend processing or withhold payment of the takeout proceeds of
developers such as C&P Homes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#66:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The failure of the subsidiaries to meet the CE
levels set by ( <indig> PAG-IBIG </indig> ) will significantly affect the
collectibility of the subsidiaries ' contracts receivable balance, &rdquo;
</quote> wrote the auditors in C&P Homes ' notes to financial statements.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#67:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
presently be determined since ( <indig> PAG-IBIG </indig> ) Circular No. 159
&rdquo; </quote> took effect in 1998.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#68:2>
It added: <quote> &ldquo; The related effects of these guidelines
will be reported in the financial statements as they become known and
estimable. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#69:2>
Meanwhile, C&P Homes ' bondholders are preparing to recover as
much of their principal as they can.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#70:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We 're kind of nervous and we intend to put a lien on
the company 's assets, &rdquo; </quote> said the fund manager.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#71:2>
However, the company has refused to give the bondholders ' group a
list of its properties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#72:2>
The bondholders claim that a <foreign> <it> dacion en pago </it>
</foreign> on a portion of the company 's short-term debts would violate a
&ldquo; negative pledge &rdquo; embodied in the customary <foreign> &ldquo;
pari passu &rdquo; </foreign> clause in their loan agreement.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#73:2>
Basically, this clause ensures that the company will treat all
creditors equally.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#74:2>
In this case, if it enters into a <foreign> <it> dacion en pago </it>
</foreign> with one class of creditor, it may have to do the same with the
rest.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#75:2>
Even holders of the &dollar;150-million FRN due 2003, issued last
year by a Cayman Island-registered wholly owned subsidiary of C&P Homes, has
this clause. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#76:2>
With only &peso;13.3 billion worth of real estate in its books,
there obviously won't be enough to pay off the company 's &peso;18-billion
debt.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#77:2>
It becomes even less when one considers that short-term creditors
want the properties to be swapped to be valued as &ldquo; raw land &rdquo;
and not as developed land. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#78:2>
C&P Homes ' creditors list contains the who 's who in Philippine
banking, industry sources said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#79:2>
Those identified with huge exposures are PCI Bank, Philippine
National Bank, Bank of the Philippine Islands ( BPI), Metropolitan Bank &
Trust Co., Union Bank of the Philippines, and the Rizal Commercial Banking
Corp.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#80:2>
They said BPI and PCI Bank 's exposures were bigger, having been the
firm 's lead underwriters for its initial public offering about three years
ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#81:2>
A source from a local bank said C&P Homes may have resorted to
the <foreign> <it> dacion en pago </it> </foreign> after its earlier plan to
seek a debt moratorium from the Securities and Exchange Commission was not
supported by its external auditor.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#82:2>
The company may have to sell some of its land bank to partially pay
off its debts.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#83:2>
C&P currently has a land bank totalling 3,000 hectares. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#84:2>
However, even if the company disposes its properties, there may
be no buyer given the prevailing glut in the real estate industry and the
condition of some of the company 's lands. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#85:2>
Analysts said the quality of C&P 's land bank will pose a problem
since several parcels are untitled while some are occupied by squatter
communities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#86:2>
This was one reason property developer Ayala Land, Inc. suspended
its planned acquisition of the company recently, another source said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-009#87:2>
This was on top of its uncollected receivables which amounted to
some &peso;12 billion. </p> </I>
