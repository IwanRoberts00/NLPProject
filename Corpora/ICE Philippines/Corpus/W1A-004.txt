<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#4:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Change doesn't necessarily assure progress, but
progress implacably requires change" </quote> stated Henry Steel Commager.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#5:1>
Truly our society had undergone a lot of changes beginning from the
first wave, better known as the Stone Age, when man used tools for survival.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#6:1>
These tools were modified until man reached the second wave.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#7:1>
This era is commonly called the <mention> Industrial Revolution
</mention> wherein people during this time witnessed the growth of factories
since machines were applied in the industries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#8:1>
Today, we are in the Electronic Generation, the third wave, an epoch
where technological development of every kind have been so rapid that we had
to accept more changes within our lifetime than once were spread over many
generations.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#9:1>
Information Technology has helped to force the pace of change in
industry, commerce, government and everyday living.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#10:1>
Almost every organization employs technology, specifically those
concerned with transmitting information that speeds up problem solving and
are designed to make the work of the employee relatively simple.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#11:1>
The Human Resource Management, as a pillar of every company, is one
department that needs to open its door to the Electronic Generation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#12:1>
This research would like to present the role that technology plays in
Human Resource Management, its effects on the attitudes of employees and why
it is an integral part of an industry who wants to become locally and
globally competitive in the years to come. </p> <h> II. <bold> Conceptual
Framework </bold> </h> <O> figure showing connection between e-HR and
Employees ' Attitudes </O> <h> III. <bold> Statement of the Problem </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#13:1>
The study aims to find the effects of different e-HR technologies
on the attitudes of employees according to gender, tenure and position.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#14:1>
The following questions were also raised to facilitate the further
study:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#15:1>
1. What are the different e-HR technologies being used by the
company?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#16:1>
2. What are the attitudes towards e-HR technologies of employees
according to:

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#17:1>
a. gender

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#18:1>
b. position

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#19:1>
c. tenure

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#20:1>
3. Is there a significant difference in attitudes of employees
according to gender, tenure and position towards e-HR technologies? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#21:1>
<h> <bold> IV. Review of Related Literature </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#22:1>
The futuristic outlook now emerging is that of the world without
barriers ( Ohmae, 1995).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#23:1>
The application of the latest technology to all areas of society
particularly in the business sector opens the doors to many other ways that
will make the job relatively simple.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#24:1>
The Human Resource Management is now trying to be updated and
advanced in order to give better services to the organization by being
on-line on what 's happening in the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#25:1>
Today the new technology has changed the functions of <mention>
Human Resources </mention> , starting from a self-service function to a more
complex one.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#26:1>
With the acquisition of the latest technology they can focus more on
planning and coaching of managers and employees.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#27:1>
The different companies can now have training complete with sound,
graphics and full motion video - just by plugging on to your PC and the
instructions are readily available, in which it expands the scope of training
that the trainees can fully understand.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#28:1>
Technologies also allow the HR practitioners to increase their level
of accessibility.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#29:1>
From traditional approach to component-based approach, from manual to
computers, these changes have significant impact on the role of <mention>
Human Resources </mention> to the organization.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#30:1>
According to Aho ( 1989) some influences that cause jobs to change
rapidly are the product life, technological advances, specialization and
organization restructuring, which creates challenges for managers, Human
Resource Department and the employees as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#31:1>
Technologies influence all functions of Human Resources
Management and employees ' view of it varies, some perceived it with fears
but others with optimism.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#32:1>
A survey commissioned by a California computer peripherals company
showed that 93% of the employees using the computers had no fears about them,
and 90% of the employees questioned express interest in using computers
whether or not their job required it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#33:1>
In addition, the traditional stereotype about word processing, data
processing and time management being so called <mention> &ldquo; women 's
work &rdquo; </mention> has been challenged.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#34:1>
The number of men and women performing clerical task on computers is
approximately the same ( Schultz, 1994). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#35:1>
Computer-aided performance appraisal offers a thorough and
accurate technique for evaluating competence on some jobs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#36:1>
Some employees favor it because it ensures that their work will be
evaluated objectively, while others find it stressful and invasion of
privacy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#37:1>
They are constantly aware that their actions are being monitored, and
this pressure sometimes leads them to focus more on quantity of output than
on quality ( Grant, Higgins, and Irving, 1988). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#38:1>
A research done among 91 employees of Internal Revenue Services
in United States showed that approximately 9% of the employees opposed
computer-aided monitoring for performance appraisal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#39:1>
This opposition was manifested in low job satisfaction and high
intention to quit.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#40:1>
The majority of the employees responded more positively to
computer-aided monitoring.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#41:1>
They showed high job satisfaction and low turnover intentions, as
long as the objective information obtained through computer-aided monitoring
was used to help employees develop and refine their job skills, but not when
information was used to punish them ( Chalykoff and Kochan, 1989). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#42:1>
<h> <bold> V. Significance of the Study </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#43:1>
This study is important for a number of reasons.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#44:1>
As globalization is transcending the world and becoming a part of
each business endeavor, there is a need for every organization to cope with
the changes that goes with it and be able to be competitive with their
counterpart countries in the region.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#45:1>
In the article written by Dr. Maura B. Fonollera of De La Salle
University, she stated that <quote> &ldquo; the HR professionals should
prepare in terms of tools for globalized interactions &rdquo; </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#46:1>
Automation of different office systems and procedures and
introduction of current instructional technologies are just one of the coping
mechanism of Human Resource Department with this new trend.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#47:1>
With this study, the HR practitioner would be able to understand the
importance of electronic technologies to their organization.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#48:1>
Through this study also, Human Resources Management can find ways of
helping their people cope up with their fears of technology and deal with
their negative impression on automation through proper training and
information. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#49:1>
Aside from its theoretical importance, this study can also have
its practical applicability for Human Resource Department. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#50:1>
<h> <bold> VI. Scope of the Study </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#51:1>
The study deals only with the description of different
technologies used in the Human Resources Management and its effects on the
attitudes of employees towards e-HR.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#52:1>
Thus, study will not discuss the technical aspect of the different
technologies used.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#53:1>
This study would like to further affirm the applicability of the
results of previous studies in the Philippine corporate setting.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#54:1>
The respondents mainly compose of employees who have experienced
re-engineering or automation of their office systems and procedures in Human
Resource Department.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#55:1>
Furthermore, the study would like to know the effects of electronic
technologies on the working attitudes of the employees according to their
gender, tenure and position in the organization. </p> </I> <subtext 2>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#56:2>
<h> <bold> Perceived Effects of Work-Family Conflicts on Work
Satisfaction of Married Employees </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#57:2>
<bold> Marjorie A. Nisperos </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#58:2>
Remarkable changes in the demographic profile of the Filipino
workforce such as the increasing numbers of working mothers and both parents
working due mainly to economic downturn pose a probable effect on how married
employees handle multiple roles.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#59:2>
These changes invoked varying effects on the traditional Filipino
family system in which the female parents usually stay at home, do household
works, care for the children and manage the overall family welfare.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#60:2>
With the current trend in which both parents are obliged to work,
there 's increased likelihood that both genders have substantial household
responsibilities in addition to work ( Bond, Galinsky, Swanberg, 1998;
Gilbert, Hallet, Eldridge, 1999).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#61:2>
Household work therefore would be divided for both parents.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#62:2>
Thus, the issue of balancing work and family emerged. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#63:2>
There have been a growing body of research focusing on the
causes, consequences and effects of the conflict that arise between work and
family roles ( Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985; Kossek & Ozeki, 1998; Kelloway,
1999).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#64:2>
Most of such research work built on the assumption that conflicting
role pressures between work and family became incompatible so that the
participation in one role is made difficult by virtue of participating in the
other ( Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#65:2>
In addition, most research materials are based on Western culture,
which were first introduced around mid 1980 's.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#66:2>
The concern for work-life balance has only been introduced in Europe
and US in 1990 's.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#67:2>
The concept therefore is relatively new especially in the Philippine
setting where only few research initiatives has been done ( Ayala Foundation,
ECOP, 2001). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#68:2>
This study attempts to determine the perceived effects of
work-life conflict on the work satisfaction of married employees in a
Filipino organization.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#69:2>
It is mainly anchored on Filipino family system ( focus on family
interfering with work rather than work interfering with family) which assumed
that Filipinos value their family first more than their work or career.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#70:2>
Research efforts was also directed in assessing if there 's a
difference in the perceived effects of WFC between married female and male
employees in relation to the notion of traditional gender roles which placed
greater responsibility on the female parent for family welfare. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#71:2>
<h> <bold> Review of Related Literature </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#72:2>
<h> <it> Work-Family Conflict </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#73:2>
The major trigger for work-family conflict research initiatives
is the change in workforce demography - more specifically, the influx of
women in the workforce.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#74:2>
This can be attributed to social and economic factors affecting an
individual 's role.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#75:2>
Over the past two decades, the growing number of research focus on
the recognition that work and family are not completely separate domains of
life ( Piotrkowski, 1979; Strains, 1980).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#76:2>
This is in contrast with the myth of separate worlds ( Kanter, 1977)
and segmentation hypothesis ( Dubin, 1973) which views work and family as two
different spheres. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#77:2>
One of the earliest research work of the foundation of
work-family conflict was done by Greenhaus and Beutell ( 1985) which defined
work and family conflict as a form of interrole conflict that emerges
whenever the demands of one role make it difficult to fulfill the requirement
of another.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#78:2>
Their work also includes the classification of work-family conflict
according to time-based, strain based and activity based. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#79:2>
In addition, early research treated work-family conflict as
mainly unidirectional construct but recent research ( Frone, Russel & Cooper,
1992) implies that it is &ldquo; reciprocal &rdquo; in nature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#80:2>
Work can interfere with family ( WIF) and family can interfere in
work ( FIW).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#81:2>
Both are distinct constructs ( Driscoll & Ilgen, 1992) but related.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#82:2>
Results indicates that work interfering with family is correlated
with job dissatisfaction, job burn-out, turnover, depression and life
dissatisfaction and marital dissatisfaction ( Thomas & Ganster, 1995; Adams,
King & King, 1996; Netemeyer, Boles & McMurrain, 1996).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#83:2>
Few works have really been focused to analyzing how family conflict
can interfere with work.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#84:2>
Example of this is the study done by Kelloway ( 1998) based on
six-month longitudinal survey data suggested that strain-based Family
Interfering with Work ( FIW) is a pre-cursor to both stress and turnover
intentions while strain-based Work Interfering with Family ( WIF) emerge only
as an outcome of stress.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#85:2>
This suggests that FIW can give a more accurate picture on how role
conflict affect individuals.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#86:2>
Although measures of WIF and FIW are strongly correlated ( Frone,
<foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1992; Gutek <foreign> et al. </foreign> ,
1991), individuals typically report more WIF than FIW, possibly because work
demands are easier to quantify. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#87:2>
Moreover, the works of Frone <foreign> et al. </foreign> ( 1992)
reported that FIW was related to both depressive symptomatology and job
distress while WIF pose ambiguous results.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#88:2>
However, works of Gignac <foreign> et al. </foreign> ( 1996) suggest
that WIF predicted job satisfaction while FIW didn't.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#89:2>
Futhermore, WIF didn't predict absence from work but FIW offered
significant prediction of absenteeism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#90:2>
For the purpose of this study, sources and nature of conflict
will only be focused on one direction, that is FIW.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#91:2>
This will be done in order to establish a clearer linear correlation
between source of conflict ( family) and its perceived effects of work
satisfaction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#92:2>
This will be based on a relatively homogenous sample thereby
providing an opportunity to clearly establish assessment of the direction of
the relationship and other psychological variable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#93:2>
In addition, this study aims to target how FIW affects work due
to the nature of the target samples ( Filipino married employees) in relation
to Filipino family values. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#94:2>
<h> <it> Role Conflict </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#95:2>
Another area of concern of this study is to establish the
relationship or effects of role ( work-family conflict based) to work
satisfaction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#96:2>
It is assumed that as work-family conflict ( WFC) increases, work
satisfaction ( WS) decreases, thereby creating an imbalance.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#97:2>
A considerable number of research on WFC suggest that work and
non-work ( family roles) roles tends to spillover into one another rather
than being two separate aspects of life ( Adams, King & King, 1996; Williams
& Alliger, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#98:2>
The &ldquo; spillover &rdquo; theory suggests that attitudes and
behaviors are posited to carry over from one role to another ( Leiton & Durup
1996).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#99:2>
Spillover can be compared to permeable boundary where roles can
somehow blend together and influence one another ( Kabonoff, 1980; Zedeck,
1990).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#100:2>
Other views on roles is the compensation theory where roles are
often interrelated in a counterbalancing manner ( Burke, 1998).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#101:2>
Moreover, another theory related to role - segmentation theory
assumes that individuals have the capacity to compartmentalize compelling
role demands ( Lambert, 1990). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#102:2>
Hart ( 1997) found that job satisfaction and non-work
satisfaction made independent contributions to overall life satisfaction, but
there was no significant relationship between work experiences and non-work
satisfaction, nor between non-work experiences and job satisfaction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-004#103:2>
This supports the segmentation theory rather than the spillover
theory of role conflict. </p> ... </I>
