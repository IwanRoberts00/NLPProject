A year ago Filipinos trooped to the EDSA Shrine to end the presidency of Joseph Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#4:1:A>
It was the second time in Philippine history that Filipinos staged a peaceful revolt to topple a government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#5:1:A>
But today the same groups who participated in the four-night vigil were barred from getting near the Shrine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#6:1:A>
In tonight 's first look Mariton Pacheco tells us why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#7:1:B>
They were part of the crowd that called for the ouster of former President Joseph Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#8:1:B>
But militant groups were barred from marching to the EDSA Shrine for lack of a permit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#9:1:B>
Not a single group was allowed to mobilize within the perimeter of the Shrine after both military and police surrounded the area <&> a fifteen second clip interview </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#10:1:B>
So these groups decided to take their mass actions elsewhere
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#11:1:B>
Urban poor groups led by running priest Father Robert Reyes walked all the way to the Ninoy Aquino monument along Ayala Avenue and held their own EDSA <foreign> Dos </foreign> anniversary celebration there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#12:1:B>
No political slogan was chanted
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#13:1:B>
It was a plain gathering for prayer and a simple feast of <indig> pandesal </indig> <&> a fifteen second clip interview </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#14:1:B>
Protests in front of Camp Aguinaldo were how militant groups <indig> Bayan </indig> and <indig> Karapatan </indig> commemorated EDSA <foreign> Dos </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#15:1:B>
They claimed there is no cause for celebration since the Arroyo government has failed to live up to its promises
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#16:1:B>
Still no calls for the President 's resignation were made but instead an appeal for unity so the administration can be given the chance to prove it is worthy of the gains from EDSA <foreign> Dos </foreign>

The opposition also rose to the occasion by hurling the very same issues that forced Estrada 's exit from Malaca&ntilde;ang against the one-year-old Arroyo government

It all boils down to a game of propaganda
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#21:1:C>
While government tries to rekindle the glory of EDSA People Power Two a glum opposition officially marked the start of a five-day period of mourning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#22:1:C>
But that 's not to say they weren't as creative <&> a fifteen second clip interview </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#23:1:C>
<indig> Puwersa ng Masa </indig> is now throwing back to the Arroyo government the same issues leveraged against the Estrada administration last year starting off with Joseph Estrada 's favorite campaign issue Poverty Alleviation <&> a twenty second clip interview </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#25:1:C>
And despite their gripes against President Arroyo they assured they 're not out to topple her government <&> a ten second clip interview </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#26:1:C>
Estrada 's supporters will conduct their own series of demonstrations capping them off with their own noise barrage and candle lighting activities lasting until the twentieth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#27:1:C>
These are the same activities launched for Estrada 's ouster last year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#28:1:C>
From all indications it looks like the tables are now turned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#29:1:C>
Those who were once forced out of power are the same ones harnessing People Power in the streets in the hopes that they too can effect change

For months Filipinos were glued to their television sets to watch the Estrada impeachment trial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#32:1:A>
The drama reached its climax when Estrada 's allies in the Senate refused to open a second envelope which allegedly contained evidence that Estrada was depositing <indig> jueteng </indig> money in Equitable P C I Bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#33:1:A>
But the trial was aborted when the prosecution walked out
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#34:1:A>
Would the outcome have been different if the players had followed a different script

These moments will forever be frozen in our collective memory <,> when eleven administration Senators voted against the opening of the second envelope when opposition Senators felt powerless when members of the prosecution and spectators in the gallery walked out in frustration and disgust while a single thoughtless action galvanized people to turn to EDSA again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#37:1:D>

Legal analyst Atty Marvie Cuyunon says EDSA <foreign> Dos </foreign> merely became a shortcut to the inevitable

Had the trial gone on and acquitted Estrada people would have surely trooped back to EDSA

Had he been convicted and removed from office Gloria Arroyo would still take oath as his successor while the Erap throng would still demand that he remain as President <&> a ten second clip interview </&>

<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#45:1:D>
But the analysts disagree

They insist all authority resides in the people and stress the legal process should be used as a tool to nurture and not hinder our democracy and aspirations <&> a fifteen second clip interview </&>

President Arroyo commemorated her rise to power with a Mass at the EDSA Shrine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#49:1:A>
The President with both her immediate and official families participated in what was a simple and solemn celebration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#50:1:A>
Carlos Valdez reports

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#51:1:E>
It was a solemn celebration just as the Church hoped it would be
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#52:1:E>
Though it was made so less by the mood of the participants than by the phalanx of troopers guarding the perimeter of the chapel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#53:1:E>
One-half of those who orchestrated the protests one year ago were at the EDSA Shrine to hear a Mass commemorating the one year anniversary of the protests which led to the ouster of former President Joseph Estrada
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#54:1:E>
The presidential family was present along with her cabinet members
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#55:1:E>
Former Presidents Ramos and Aquino were there along with some administration Senators and Congressmen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#56:1:E>
Barely a kilometer away the other half of the People Power equation was having its own commemorative event
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#57:1:E>
Members of the COPA and the Philippine Consultative Assembly as well as other personalities from different sectors chose to celebrate in their own way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#58:1:E>
Earlier some members of militant labor and school organizations marching towards the Shrine were met at every turn by barbed-wire fences and gun-toting policemen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#59:1:E>
They were told to contain their celebration in La Salle Greenhills
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#60:1:E>
They weren't allowed to attend the festivities at the Shrine by an order which was released just today <&> a thirty second clip interview </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#61:1:E>
As the first day of expected four-day commemorative celebrations draws to a close it is still unclear how events may unfold
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#62:1:E>
For many are starting to wonder why these forces once solidly united in ousting a President seem so bitterly divided just one year later

Misuari 's message calling on supporters not to resort to violence was coursed through four M N L F commanders who visited Misuari at Campo Santo Domingo today

<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#123:1:G>
They believe Fidelito Dizon and Artemio Villareal are not the only ones guilty of homicide but the others accused as well

They say the two are just fall guys to give a semblance that justice was served
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#125:1:G>
Among the suspects the two are allegedly the ones with the least backers in government

They add that Dizon and Villareal had been expelled from the Ateneo law school long before Leny 's fatal hazing in nineteen ninety-one but they still participated in the initiation rites since they are Aquilans
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-013#127:1:G>
