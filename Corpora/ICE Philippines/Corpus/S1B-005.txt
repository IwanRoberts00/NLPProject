<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#1:1:A>
This month is Holy Week then after Holy Week is already uh unholy week <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#2:1:A>
I mean review week
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#3:1:A>
Then after the review week you have the finals <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#4:1:A>
Do not forget the requirements that I 've asked you to do specifically the one on the drama <indig> 'no </indig> <unclear> words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#5:1:A>
Then I gave you already last time the matters for the paper
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#6:1:A>
Do not forget those because you may run out of time <,,> <unclear> words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#7:1:A>
We go on and uh continue our discussion of the nature of poetry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#8:1:A>
We started on this last time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#9:1:A>
We have already some ideas as to why we said uh poetry in our present society seems to be not as popular as it used to be in the earlier period
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#10:1:A>
And we said that in general what was the main reason for this
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#11:1:A>
Do you remember what we said about this uh last time Miguel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#12:1:A>
What would be in general the primary reason why we have this particular attitude of disinclination for poetry and uh why poetry is unpopular

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#13:1:B>
Sir poverty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#14:1:A>
You explain

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#15:1:B>
Sir since uh before uh <unclear> words </unclear> poetry is very popular at that time but but uh after we we our our economy became unstable uhm poetry became <,> became <unclear> words </unclear> <indig> biglang nawala Sir kasi </indig> it 's very impractical now to to to

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#16:1:A>
So why is it now let us say quite impractical as you 're saying when we try to pursue the matter of poetry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#17:1:A>
What makes it impractical

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#18:1:B>
Because uh we only uh we have to we only think of our survival we we don't have time for leisure

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#19:1:A>
Right so probably the idea of leisure time is no longer no longer available for us since uh as we said our poverty dramatically demands that we pay more attention to some other basic needs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#20:1:A>
Of course we are generalizing on that <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#21:1:A>
The uh the rich society or the rich members of society in our society have all the leisure time and have all the money to pursue artistic activities but we are talking about the ordinary common people which would form the majority of our society
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#22:1:A>
So what does that illustrate there Miguel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#23:1:A>
It illustrates that art and literature to be popular must really address a segment of society that is ready for them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#24:1:A>
And how how will we be how will we be ready for such kind of art and poetry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#25:1:A>
When will we be ready in <,> for such things

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#26:1:B>
Maybe uhm when our economy is stable

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#27:1:A>
Yeah economy will be stable

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#28:1:B>
Most of our people will be above average

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#29:1:A>
Okay and have better economic situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#30:1:A>
Why
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#31:1:A>
Because it 's very obvious
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#32:1:A>
You want to learn you want to appreciate art
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#33:1:A>
You have no money
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#34:1:A>
How can you how can you get the means by which to appreciate art
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#35:1:A>
Poetry what what do you need
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#36:1:A>
To read the books where the poems are supposed to be found
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#37:1:A>
Or to listen to poets read their poems
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#38:1:A>
Or to have discussions of poetry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#39:1:A>
But if you have no time and money you will exclude yourself from such kind of activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#40:1:A>
It seems these we said uh were activities that refer to the spiritual intellectual development of man
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#41:1:A>
In a poor society you have to attend first to the development of your body before you can attend to your mind
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#42:1:A>
I think that 's very obvious
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#43:1:A>
If you if you make a study of the third world countries in this uh in this world you will find that they have all of these countries have really much the same situation as we have in terms of the popularity of the arts
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#44:1:A>
That 's the tragedy of a poor country this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#45:1:A>
The poor the poor people cannot really even if they want to attend to the necessities of the mind because they are still attending to the necessities of the stomach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#46:1:A>
No matter how you may like to improve your intelligence your artistic uh sensibility if you are poor you have already a lot of obstacles <indig> no </indig> in front of you before you can improve yourself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#47:1:A>
That 's why if you notice in our society you people you belong to the better-off segment of society the more fortunate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#48:1:A>
Compare yourselves to people of your same age who are poor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#49:1:A>
You have all the advantages <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#50:1:A>
There 's this guy from uh <indig> promdi </indig> as we say
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#51:1:A>
He 's poor he wants to study but he has no money
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#52:1:A>
Where can he go
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#53:1:A>
He can't go to La Salle where presumably there 's quality education
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#54:1:A>
So where does he end up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#55:1:A>
He end up he ends up in one of those corner uh universities in Manila where the educational facilities and instruction are not quite at par with the ones we have in La Salle or Ateneo or some other private schools
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#56:1:A>
He has already a disadvantage
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#57:1:A>
<indig> Talo na agad siya 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#58:1:A>
Not only that he has no money
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#59:1:A>
He cannot buy all the books that you can read and increase your grade
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#60:1:A>
And when he graduates he graduates with a kind of lesser lesser intellectual development than you do because in La Salle you have all the facilities
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#61:1:A>
You have all the good teachers of uh literature <O> laughter </O> but those other people you observe you go to
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#62:1:A>
I was in P U P last Saturday I gave a lecture on literature and they have a different culture over there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#63:1:A>
They don't talk about literature as we talk in class
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#64:1:A>
They still talk of literature as if it were part of the struggle to liberate the society from the oppressions of this and that society
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#65:1:A>
In short the way you tend to look at literature will also affect your appreciation and your understanding of it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#66:1:A>
And as I was saying since literature pertains to the mind really in terms of effects it 's an intellectual activity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#67:1:A>
If I 'm not concerned with my intelligence because I 'm more concerned with my body I 'm at a disadvantage in terms of effects
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#68:1:A>
We do not realize that <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#69:1:A>
You people who are in that kind of advantage but you should because you have all the facilities the means by which you can improve your mind at the same time that you 're planning to improve your body
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#70:1:A>
Then when you graduate you have your degree and that guy has a degree from P U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#71:1:A>
Who gives a damn about a college degree from P U P
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#72:1:A>
If you apply in Makati for a job will they say uh P U P this is what this is the guy we get no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#73:1:A>
You have all the advantage
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#74:1:A>
Your parents are already there in the institutions you want to apply at
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#75:1:A>
Probably your parents own the institution so at once you are vice-president
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#76:1:A>
This poor guy this poor uh uh wretched fellow from P U P starts as a janitor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#77:1:A>
So <indig> wala na <indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#78:1:A>
<indig> Hindi siya makakahabol sa inyo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#79:1:A>
That 's what I 'm meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#80:1:A>
Because of that disparity in your social situations
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#81:1:A>
That 's how it is in the poor countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#82:1:A>
'Cause you know from your studies <,> ninety percent of the of the economy of this country is in the hands of a very few
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#83:1:A>
They 're the ones dictating the trends and the developments in our society
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#84:1:A>
If you don't belong to that ninety percent whether by birth or by employment you lose a lot in terms of advancement <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#85:1:A>
So what are all of these things anyway insofar as poetry is concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#86:1:A>
Can poetry help you any better when you graduate from La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#87:1:A>
Will poetry a knowledge of poetry be an advantage to you when you apply for a job in a bank
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#88:1:A>
Will the bank manager when he is processing your application paper tell you could you recite to me this or that poem so I 'll know if I get you <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#89:1:A>
Of course not
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#90:1:A>
<indig> Di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#91:1:A>
<indig> Di naman itatanong 'yon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#92:1:A>
<indig> Marunong ka bang mag- </indig> determine <indig> ng </indig> metaphor or simile
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#93:1:A>
Those things will not help
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#94:1:A>
In short again poetry is useless for such practical purposes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#95:1:A>
Alright it 's useless
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#96:1:A>
You can live and die without having read a book of poetry and God will not take that against you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#97:1:A>
It will neither lessen nor add to your being a human being in the sense of practicality right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#98:1:A>
It has no functional value in short unlike engineering
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#99:1:A>
When you take up civil engineering or chemical engineering
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#100:1:A>
Undoubtedly that 's why you 're taking them up you will be very much using them when you graduate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#101:1:A>
In poetry no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#102:1:A>
Why are we taking up poetry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#103:1:A>
Why read poetry at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#104:1:A>
Isn't that isn't that quite uh strange
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#105:1:A>
Why not just let the situation be
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#106:1:A>
Don't read poetry anyway it 's not useful for us
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#107:1:A>
Why all of this talk about relating it to your life and so on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#108:1:A>
Why is it part of your curriculum in this university anyway you won't be using it at all after you graduate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#109:1:A>
Its use of course will not be in the practical sense
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#110:1:A>
Its use will be something else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#111:1:A>
Its use will be a personal use for you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#112:1:A>
And that 's very hard to see if you 're not used to that kind of uh thinking you 're not used to that kind of attitude towards art
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#113:1:A>
Why do you see a movie for instance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#114:1:A>
Why do you listen to a piece of music
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#115:1:A>
Is it the same as when you read a piece of poetry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#116:1:A>
You don't think of any practical <,> advantage at once or any practical result when you listen to a piece of music do you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#117:1:A>
But why do you listen to your favorite musician the great masterpieces of your favorite singers Andrew E for instance <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#118:1:A>
What do you get what do you get out of that uh Irwin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#119:1:A>
Why do you listen to music in general for instance <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#120:1:A>
<indig> Ha </indig> Irwin <,> do you listen to music
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#121:1:A>
<indig> Ha </indig> Irwin
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#122:1:A>
<indig> Si </indig> Irwin yes

 <$?> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#123:1:?> Irvin

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#124:1:A>
Irvin <indig> uh oo nga 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#125:1:A>
Irvin you listen to Chinese music

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#126:1:C>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#127:1:A>
So why do you listen to Chinese music
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#128:1:A>
What do you get out of it <&> inaudible answer </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#129:1:A>
Oh explain what do I what do you mean by entertainment

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#130:1:C>
So you can relax

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#131:1:A>
Okay yeah that 's a good word
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#132:1:A>
Relax
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#133:1:A>
<indig> Hindi ba gaya nga ng sabi sa </indig> Mass <,> peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#134:1:A>
You want inner peace there are only two ways you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#135:1:A>
Go to God or go to art you see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#136:1:A>
Both can give you peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#137:1:A>
Sometimes God is very busy for mere mortals like Irvin Lim
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#138:1:A>
Who 's Irvin Lim anyway <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#139:1:A>
So many billions of people in this world and there are more important people than <.> Ir </.> Irvin Lim
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#140:1:A>
So don't go to God you probably can go to art Chinese music Japanese music Filipino music modern classical whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#141:1:A>
Because you want to relax and I imagine what you can relax with Irvin is that kind of uh comfort that kind of peace isn't it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#142:1:A>
<indig> Kasi </indig> very often you listen to music when you want to forget your problems problems of your stomach the problems of your practical everyday life isn't it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#143:1:A>
You notice that you go to something not practical
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#144:1:A>
You can easily go to McDonald and eat <.> your </.> yourself away but that will not give you peace isn't it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#145:1:A>
It will give you indigestion <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#146:1:A>
That 's not peace even if that 's the most practical thing you should do to solve your problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#147:1:A>
You go to something spiritual you see and that 's it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#148:1:A>
And that 's personal you cannot say since I I enjoy this piece of music you should also enjoy it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#149:1:A>
No because there will be quite a lot of differences between you and the other guy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#150:1:A>
I do not say that you may not get the same effect
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#151:1:A>
But the degree will be different
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#152:1:A>
That 's why you have favorite musicians favorite pieces favorite writers if ever you read literature and so on <indig> di ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#153:1:A>
They are your personal link to some kind of inner peace that you would like to get
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#154:1:A>
The same with poetry you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#155:1:A>
If we look at poetry as a means by which such kind of relaxation can also be achieved then probably we will have some kind of change of attitude towards it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#156:1:A>
We won't dislike it right at the very start
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#157:1:A>
You go to poetry like you go to music
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#158:1:A>
It will have no practical value to you first but it will have personal value
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#159:1:A>
For instance the first time you see this kind of idea in this poem an idea you never touched on in engineering or chemistry or whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#160:1:A>
<indig> Ngayon nakita mo rito </indig> and then you realize that is true
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#161:1:A>
<indig> Yon lang </indig> realization of the meaning of that idea is already a joy isn't it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#162:1:A>
'Cause knowledge is joy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#163:1:A>
Knowledge is power
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#164:1:A>
Or you just listen to the sound of the words together
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#165:1:A>
<indig> Magandang pakinggan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#166:1:A>
The rhythm or the rhyme even if you don't understand the whole poem but there may be certain parts that appeal to your sense of hearing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#167:1:A>
<indig> 'Yan </indig> that 's already a form of enjoyment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#168:1:A>
Or because of the poem you 're able to imagine certain things
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#169:1:A>
That 's it the joy of imagining what before you had not thought you could imagine that is also enjoyment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#170:1:A>
So those small areas those small effects of the poem may contribute to some kind of changes inside you a change that or changes that are really as I would say more personal than anything else
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#171:1:A>
What we do in a class like this in poetry is try to formalize only is try to substantiate all of those things that you can possibly get from reading poetry so that in a way we can all see at the same time something that can be seen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#172:1:A>
But I repeat it is a highly personal activity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#173:1:A>
Since we 're in a classroom we could try to see whether this is possible on a larger class scale <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#174:1:A>
As in our definition last time you remember our definition of our working definition of poetry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#175:1:A>
Could you repeat that Manuel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#176:1:A>
What what what did we say was the working definition of poetry

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#177:1:D>
Poetry is a kind of language that expresses more than prose <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#178:1:A>
Okay expresses or says <indig> 'no </indig> more than prose <,> <&> writes on the board </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#179:1:A>
Alright poetry is a kind of language that says more or expresses more than prose and says more says it more I 'm sorry intensely than prose
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#180:1:A>
So we have two two aspects of the definition
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#181:1:A>
And that is what we have just tried to illustrate <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#182:1:A>
This area of intensity and quantity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#183:1:A>
It 's quantity <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-005#184:1:A>
This one is quality <indig> 'no <indig> intense 

 </I>
