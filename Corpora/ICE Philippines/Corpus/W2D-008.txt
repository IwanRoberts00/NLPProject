<h> <bold> A. EMPLOYMENT NORMS AND CONDITIONS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#38:1>
<h> 1. General Functions </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#39:1>
Full-time academic teaching faculty members are those who are
hired on a full-time basis.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#40:1>
They are expected to continually participate in the University 's
pursuance of its mission.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#41:1>
In this regard they are to fully concentrate on the following
interrelated functions relevant to the positions they possess: </p> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#42:1>
<h> 1.1Teaching. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#43:1>
Teaching, a primary activity in the University, is understood to mean
the act of facilitating the acquisition of knowledge and skills with
confidence and direction, geared towards the development of the analytical
and creative faculties of students.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#44:1>
Furthermore, the function of teaching includes specific tasks, such
as student consultation, academic advising, and all other initiatives that
facilitate the process of learning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#45:1>
<h> 1.2 Research. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#46:1>
Research activities are deemed reflective of the level of disciplinal
specialization attained by the individual and the entire academic faculty.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#47:1>
Recognized for their particular capabilities, faculty members are
expected to continually explore areas of inquiry through various forms of
research.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#48:1>
These forms include basic/applied research, materials development,
papers for local and international conferences, articles, monographs, books
for publication, research/seminar papers for graduate studies, feasibility
studies, creative works and other research output related to external
professional activities ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> consultancies, <foreign>
etc. </foreign> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#49:1>
Moreover, the research of full-time academic faculty should
address the requirements of the discipline ( <foreign> i.e. </foreign> ,
upgrading the teaching or re-examining the scope or reformulating the
orientation of the entire discipline or just a single subject) and the
development concerns of Philippine society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#50:1>
<h> 1. 3 Academic Development and Professional Growth. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#51:1>
Full-time academic faculty members are obligated to continuously
develop their knowledge of and skills within the discipline to which they
belong.

The University shall ensure that they are afforded support in
pursuing graduate studies and participating in conferences/seminars and
training programs to fulfill the abovementioned expectation in accordance
with the provisions of the established Faculty Development Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#53:1>
The University also recognizes the reality that faculty members
have to engage in other professional activities similarly meant to upgrade
their skills and knowledge within their respective fields.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#54:1>
In this regard, the University allows, within agreed-upon norms and
University policies, the involvement of faculty members in discipline-related
consultancies or projects beyond the confines of the academic community. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#55:1>
<h> 1.4 University and Community Service. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#56:1>
As an extension of their academic functions, full-time academic
faculty members may be required by the University to participate in various
councils/committees/boards that program/plan/implement curricular and/or
co-curricular activities, and to engage in peer evaluation and academic
advising upon request. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#57:1>
Full-time academic faculty members are strongly encouraged to
participate in community service either in University-sponsored community
extension projects or in their own community/sectoral/professional
organizations.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#58:1>
Participation of faculty members in these activities is regarded as
part of their professional and personal commitment to the academic
profession. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#59:1>

the Executive Vice-President in consultation with the Dean.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#77:1>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#82:1>
In extremely meritorious cases, guided by the criteria for
assignment of overload to regular faculty, the Dean may approve additional

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#85:1>
Laboratory classes constitute one ( 1) preparation in departments
where such classes are considered separate from the lecture subject. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#86:1>
Any load in excess of three ( 3) class preparations requires
consultation between the Department Chair and the faculty member concerned
and the decision is subject to the approval of the Dean. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#91:1>
2.6.1.4. The fourth preparation is a regular class. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#92:1>
2.6.2. Faculty members assigned loads in excess of the limit for
class preparations shall be given a differential pay amounting to one-third (
1/3) of the hourly overload pay computed for the duration of the entire term.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-008#93:1>
2.6.3. In identifying the class for which the premium should be
paid for additional class preparation, the Chair should single out the
subject least taught by the faculty member. </p>
