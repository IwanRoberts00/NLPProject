<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#4:1:A>
And I also greet uh Nike Mora who wrote me the letter that will be today 's forum today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#5:1:A>
And uh also to thank the entire administration of the De La Salle University <,> I say this because for the last uh eleven years I have been supporting this fora here in the De La Salle University <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#7:1:A>
My daughter is graduating from high school <,> at Alabang
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#8:1:A>
And by the way Margie my daughter I don't know if she 's around here I told her to sneak in even if she 's uh only a high school student
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#10:1:A>
<indig> Nandiyan ka ba Margie </indig> <0> laughter </0> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#11:1:A>
Uh she was asking me to do her a favor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#12:1:A>
<indig> Sabi niya Papa pakisilip mo naman yung </indig> results <indig> ng </indig> examination <indig> ko </indig> <O> laughter </O> <indig> talagang gusto kong pumasok uli sa </indig> La Salle for uh college 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#14:1:A>
Anyway ladies and gentlemen <,,> I was asked to speak on the subject of insurgency and I am fully prepared to do that for the next one hour and a half with all of these materials that were brought by my assistants in uh two suitcases <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#15:1:A>
But uh perhaps since insurgency is uh really one of the many manifestations of uh basic conditions that exist in our country today you might want me to talk about other matters pertaining to <,> other threats to our security situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#17:1:A>
That includes not only the communist insurgents but also the Muslim secessionists in the south and also <,> the military rebels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#18:1:A>
Some of <.> tho </.> some of whom uh you may know or maybe your friends <,> uh no reaction <unclear> 3 words </unclear> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#19:1:A>
As well as maybe the Gulf War and its implications on the Philippine situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#20:1:A>
But anyway uh whatever be the subject you might want me to branch into later on let 's bring that out in the open forum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#21:1:A>
But on the insurgency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#22:1:A>
First of all let us look at the our government structure to cope with the basic problems of Philippine society
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#23:1:A>
I think if we can start from that since uh as I understand this group is very socially conscious and that one of your uh mandatory subjects is a social outreach program
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#24:1:A>
Uh let me just show you that uh our Philippine government now under the Aquino administration uh surely because of lessons learned from the EDSA People 's Revolution of nineteen eighty-six has seen to it that we attend to the basic causes that have led to various problems and difficulties in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#25:1:A>
So uh <,> Alex would you kindly show the <?> flow </?> <&> not clear could be <?> whole </?> </&> chart
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#26:1:A>
So very quickly let me just say that uh as identified by most uh social and political scientists that the basic problems of our country arise from the poverty of a great number of our people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#27:1:A>
Also ignorance ignorance not only in terms of the lack of education but also the lack of communications coming from the authorities to the masses of the people to inform the citizenry of what 's going on in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#28:1:A>
Injustice of course which has many forms
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#29:1:A>
Fear and apathy arising precisely out of insurgency and uh criminality and secession and even rebellion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#30:1:A>
Graft and corruption <,> the favorite subject of uh Miriam Santiago Defensor as well as also my favorite subject together with many others
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#31:1:A>
And uh we have recently added overpopulation with no offense meant to anybody especially here in the De La Salle University
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#32:1:A>
But uh as you can see poverty appears there as the biggest of them all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#33:1:A>
Estimates show that uh about fifty to fifty-five percent of the Filipino people now <,> in early nineteen ninety-one fall below what is known as the poverty line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#34:1:A>
And this is reflected in many many physical manifestations out there in the streets but also in many other ways which are not readily visible to the ordinary observer such as the poor health of our children
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#35:1:A>
The uh lack of opportunity and social mobility on the part of uh many of our youth as well as also the uh unemployment and underemployment of many of our people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#36:1:A>
Anyway to attend to these problems our government has devised a uh two track system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#37:1:A>
The two tracks of the railroad as we say which would lead to a better future <,> for the Filipinos especially the young Filipinos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#38:1:A>
And these are the twin tracks of economic development and peace and order and security <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#39:1:A>
Now let me explain this chart which shows the inter-agency linkages in government as well as with the private sector to achieve socio-political economic reforms and goals
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#40:1:A>
All of which are to be protected by the military and the law enforcement authorities throughout the entire process of reform and change
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#41:1:A>
Uh first of all uh with the President at the very top there <,> there is the socio-economic development side which is the which are the red blocks
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#42:1:A>
At the national level of course there 's the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#43:1:A>
She 's the chairman of the National Economic Development Authority or NEDA
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#44:1:A>
Then down below we have the regions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#45:1:A>
There are fourteen regions in this country twelve numbered regions and then the National Capital Region which is Metro Manila and the Cordillera <,> Administrative Region which is out there in the mountains on the North
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#46:1:A>
Now at the regional level we have a regional development council which attends to the coordination of uh the various programs of the various line agencies in government
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#47:1:A>
And this means Public Works Health DECS Transportation Communication uh <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#48:1:A>
Now each regional development council is advised by what they call a regional development assembly which is uh the body that consists of the elected officials in the region senators congressmen and representatives of the uh most respected non-government organizations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#49:1:A>
So as you can see right away the people represented by N G O 's are represented
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#50:1:A>
Now at the provincial level we have the P D C chaired by the governor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#51:1:A>
And then down at the city and municipal levels the city extra-development council headed by their mayors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#52:1:A>
And on down to the <indig> barangay </indig> and then to the people <,> hitting and working against these basic conditions of Philippine society that have given rise to our various problems be they social economic political or military
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#53:1:A>
Now on the other side we have the security and the peace and order council system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#54:1:A>
Again the President heads this in her capacity as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces as well as of all other armed forces in the country meaning the Philippine National Police
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#55:1:A>
At the national level there is the national chairman which is who is the Secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government Secretary Luis T Santos and uh yours truly is the national vice-chairman
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#57:1:A>
Now there 's also a regional <,> peace and order council headed by either a regional director or a provincial governor who is elected by his peers at the region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#58:1:A>
Then more importantly again a provincial council headed by the same governor of that province who is also the chairman of the development side
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#59:1:A>
And then again the city and <?> concerned </?> mayors down to the <indig> barangays </indig> to the people again hitting these basic problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#60:1:A>
Now facilitating these two tracks of the railroad harmonizing them coordinating them is the so called CORD system CORD meaning Cabinet Officer for Regional Development <O> cough </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#61:1:A>
I am the CORD for Region Nine I don't know whether any of you know where Region Nine is uh there is an Ateneo university there in Region Nine but no De La Salle <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#62:1:A>
Uh this is in Zamboanga and uh there are five provinces in that region <,> Zamboanga del Sur Zamboanga del Norte Basilan Sulu and Tawi-Tawi
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#64:1:A>
It 's probably the most difficult region to work in because you have there the secessionist movement you have the C P P N P A then you have the problem of just being so far away from the center of action which is Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#65:1:A>
Anyway you might wonder where you belong in this entire set-up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#66:1:A>
Well you as young citizens from the private sector are in in are in all of these levels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#67:1:A>
You are either <,> yourself a member of the community in the <indig> barangay </indig> where you live whether it be a <indig> barangay </indig> in Las Pi&ntilde;as or Alabang or uh here in uh Manila itself
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#68:1:A>
Or as someone represented by any of the non-government organizations that have memberships in all of these various components and elements of our government system to uh attend to these problems
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#69:1:A>
And so uh I thought that it is important for me to show that you are right here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#70:1:A>
You are in the people portion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#71:1:A>
You are in the <indig> barangay </indig> portion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#72:1:A>
You are in the city and municipal levels as concerned citizens
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#73:1:A>
And uh surely as students of our social and economic milieu in the Philippines in nineteen ninety-one you must constantly inquire into how is it in your community how is it in your neighborhood how is it in your municipality how 's my mayor doing <,> because what I shall tell you later on are some of the things that they are expected to do so that we shall have a better condition of security and development in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#74:1:A>
Now uh may I just show you also by way of backgrounder our national defense system in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#75:1:A>
There are three levels here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#76:1:A>
The biggest one which is the basic and to me the most important layer is what we call the civilian volunteer organizations or <indig> Bantay Bayan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#77:1:A>
This has many names <indig> Barangay Tanod Bantay Bayan Nakasaka </indig> C B O Neighborhood Association <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#78:1:A>
And then uh let me go back to that later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#79:1:A>
And then we have the so-called territorial forces
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#80:1:A>
These are elements that are found in all of our towns and cities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#81:1:A>
That 's why they 're called <mention> territorial </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#82:1:A>
And these are mainly the Police and what we call the CAFGU or the uh units of the reserve force of the Armed Forces that are on duty to provide protection of their respective neighborhoods
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#83:1:A>
And then uh thirdly the mobile forces of the Armed Forces of the Philippines with brigades battalions uh naval uh patrol <unclear> 1 word </unclear> of uh helicopters and fighter planes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#84:1:A>
Those of you who are in the R O T C or C M T are familiar with uh these units that we call the mobile forces
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#85:1:A>
Now the uh civilian volunteer organizations are unarmed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#86:1:A>
They are not really expected to fight as combatants but they do provide services that are important to the safety and the security of the community such as <,> information services information about strange happenings or strange people or strange uh movements in the community
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#87:1:A>
And uh also they provide emergency services medical fire-fighting uh <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#88:1:A>
Now you will note that they are surrounded by the people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#89:1:A>
Without that sea of people around them none of these elements will be effective at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#90:1:A>
You 'll also note that these three elements are interlocking and overlapping and that 's because <,> they do overlap in their functions but more importantly they are interlocked as a <,> integral chain of defense for our safety and security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#91:1:A>
Now <,> the uh system operates in a certain manner which is what we call the four steps method or the four step operational strategy in the field
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#92:1:A>
Uh suppose there is a <indig> barangay </indig> let 's say here in Laguna near the mountains that is still affected by the insurgents or by the communist ideology and there are armed elements therein 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#> What happens insofar as government actions are concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#93:1:A>
First of all there must be a clearing phase
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#94:1:A>
<indig> Dapat e labanan natin kaagad yung mga <,> </indig> N P A who are armed so that they can be ejected from that <indig> barangay </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#95:1:A>
This is the clearing phase and here we use our most capable units our mobile forces battalions uh strike companies <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#96:1:A>
And after the clearing has been done the same <indig> barangay </indig> must be held and protected so that the uh armed enemy does not come back again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#97:1:A>
And then beyond that a consolidation phase and this is where some of your efforts can contribute to the welfare of a community
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#98:1:A>
When you go out there to uh provide medical assistance for instance you are really taking part now in the consolidation phase which leads to the final phase which is the full development of the <indig> barangay </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#99:1:A>
That is when uh <,> twenty-four hour electrification is provided
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#100:1:A>
Uh a good water supply system is uh put in place
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#101:1:A>
And maybe there is a nice schoolhouse with a full time teaching staff that would be established in the community
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-025#102:1:A>
At that point we consider the <indig> barangay </indig> to be fully developed 

 </I>
