Dear Gloria,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#2:1>
I saw the claim slip on top of the computer after my morning duty
last July 7.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#3:1>
I wasn't able to get the package at the post office because it was
pouring like hell that afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#4:1>
And I was very tired from work.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#5:1>
We had around 42 patients to serve when I endorsed it to the next
shift.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#6:1>
All the hospital which I know are fully booked except maybe the ward.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#7:1>
It was the wedding anniversary of Mom, the birthday of Ece and
Lediglace ( pardon my spelling of her name because I don't know the exact
spelling).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#8:1>
Jerivel celebrated Ece 's birthday at the other house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#9:1>
We had two baked heads of the pig, Jerivel 's <indig> amot </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#10:1>
Boboy and Didi also chipped in on the party. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#11:1>
I wasn't able to bring any because I wasn't told to.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#12:1>
It was mostly the idea of Jerivel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#13:1>
I wasn't able to get the package the next day ( July 8), thinking
that the post office would be open half-day, which wasn't.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#14:1>
I got the package, Monday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#15:1>
Thanks for the magazines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#16:1>
Today 's the 12th of July.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#17:1>
I 'm on night duty again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#18:1>
I wasn't able to continue with the last part of this paragraph
because time caught up with me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#19:1>
Today 's the 22nd of July.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#20:1>
It 's been quite sometime when I was able to get hold of the
computer.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#21:1>
I already had the TV repaired at the National Panasonic service
center.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#22:1>
I didn't spend a cent since it was still under warranty.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#23:1>
It 's covered up to 3 years.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#24:1>
I was able to get the certificate of ownership from Lopue 's San
Sebastian because the service center needed to know the date we purchased the
unit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#25:1>
We spent the rest of the afternoon at the other house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#26:1>
We stayed there until after dinnertime.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#27:1>
The people at the other house have been asking if you will be coming
home this August.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#28:1>
I told them that we talked over the phone regarding this but even I
am having some second thought about this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#29:1>
Today 's 27th of July.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#30:1>
Work has been very much loaded.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#31:1>
I was mostly spending my time resting for the next day 's duty.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#32:1>
I have been doing much overtime duties.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#33:1>
Alex and Celso went to Manila to attend the PAPC convention for
pulmonary therapists.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#34:1>
Since there was a lack of staff to go on duty, we were told to go
overtime.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#35:1>
Joel Sombito, one of the staff, got ill.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#36:1>
He experience high blood pressure and was admitted at the hospital
for about four days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#37:1>
That added to our workloads.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#38:1>
Going on duty for 16 hours, eight hours as overtime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#39:1>
The hospital has been jam-packed with patients for almost a month
already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#40:1>
That 's why most of my time is spent resting because I would either
be on 16 hour duty in the morning until evening or the other half.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#41:1>
The pay would be great but the workload has also its toll on us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#42:1>
Nobody in the office would like to exchange duties for the meantime
because they know that they would be working double time.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#43:1>
Before there was time to read the newspaper.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#44:1>
Now, there isn't even enough time to eat.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#45:1>
Celso is planning to employ externs for the duration of four months
as volunteer ( contractual).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#46:1>
It would be good to have some extra hands around the office
especially if this workload keeps up like this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#47:1>
Art went to Tacloban to visit his brother and for business.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#48:1>
I wasn't able to go to their place lately because I didn't feel
energetic enough to do so.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#49:1>
Daddy Filoteo and Mommy Sabel are staying at their place in the
meantime that Art is not around. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#50:1>
How are you doing there?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#51:1>
I didn't hear much from you except when the day you called.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#52:1>
I understand that your time has been spent mostly on your studies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#53:1>
Keep it up so that we could see each other again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#54:1>
Your picture in front of the computer standing beside the rails of a
wharf has been frightening away a lot of rats.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#55:1>
If there are any.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#56:1>
One night when Alex and I went outing after his K-20 broke down he
picked up the picture to see who it was and just smiled in the morning when
he woke up.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#57:1>
He stayed overnight because he couldn't have his vehicle fixed
because it happened late in the afternoon where you couldn't get hold of a
mechanic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#58:1>
Alex 's dad underwent an operation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#59:1>
I don't know what it was called but I know that Patricia Tan took out
2 inches of his intestine because there was somewhat of a growth.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#60:1>
His dad was admitted for 2 weeks after the operation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#61:1>
Alex and his dad are going to Manila maybe next month for
chemotherapy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#62:1>
P. Tan said there was still part of the growth left adhering to one
of the parts inside the abdomen.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#63:1>
And chemotherapy would be the only solution to hinder the growth.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#64:1>
JM was given <mention> Zadec </mention> by Dr. Javelosa for 2
months.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#65:1>
And he 's been eating well lately.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#66:1>
JM and Jojo are doing well in school.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#67:1>
Mom has been the one tutoring him because that 's what he wants.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#68:1>
He was pick out by his teacher to <del> do </del-> present some
oratorical piece in a contest.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#69:1>
I 'm getting him a USLS bag for the stroller because the knapsack
isn't suited for the stroller.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#70:1>
We put a temporary basketball post with ring near the garage for them
to play with.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#71:1>
The kids play rough now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#72:1>
Jerivel this morning asked me before I headed home from my 16
hour duty, if I was going to send you a letter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#73:1>
I said yes but maybe later during the month.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#74:1>
He asked me if you are to come home at the end of the month of
August, and I said I don't know.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#75:1>
But if you do come home even later on, he said not to forget to give
his brother a call before, regarding to the <indig> pasalubong </indig> if
there are any. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#76:1>
I have been staying inside the four corners of the room most of
the time watching television.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#77:1>
It would be nice to have somebody to talk to in the room.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#78:1>
The kids also spend most of the time watching their cartoon movies
after school.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#79:1>
We talk only when they encounter some conflict with each other or
when we 're at the table eating except if I 'm free on weekend we never fail
to go to the other house. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#80:1>
Iting has classes until eight in the evening.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#81:1>
Maybe you know about that already but I don't have anything to tell
you about anymore that you don't already know.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#82:1>
Ah!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#83:1>
I just remembered this.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#84:1>
Joanne is planning to go to Cebu and stay there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#85:1>
That 's what I heard from Jerivel and Alex.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#86:1>
She 's hiring Alex with his driver to take her to Cebu with Jerivel
to tag along.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#87:1>
They 're even inviting me to go with them but I don't think it 's a
very good idea.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#88:1>
I don't want to get into any hot water.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#89:1>
I have a lot of that around the house, which I don't know which to do
first.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#90:1>
Now that is pure <indig> tsismis </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#91:1>
Today is the 31st of July.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#92:1>
It was great to hear from you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#93:1>
After you called, I sure wasn't able to go back to sleep.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#94:1>
Anyway, the short talk was very rewarding.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#95:1>
I ate lunch with JM and Mom and later on retired to catch some sleep
but nothing happened.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#96:1>
Instead I just watch TV and saw a short clip on the cable about a
small tool with a hundred uses.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#97:1>
The name of the tool was <mention> SKEWDRIVER </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#98:1>
It 's a screwdriver and a socket wrench in one.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#99:1>
It was not stated as to how much it cost to acquire it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#100:1>
But if it is not expensive, could you get me one?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#101:1>
Don't worry about the weight because it is a very small tool wherein
you could put the whole container into your back pocket.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#102:1>
If you want to know another thing, my wallet, which is usually thin,
has incurred a hole from the tear and wear.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#103:1>
Alex and Rhea hasn't broken the news to Rhea 's father yet about the
marriage that they are planning.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#104:1>
I told him not to take a lot of time off with this thing because the
baby can't wait.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#105:1>
They ought to know about it as early as possible otherwise they 'll
know about it from some other person which wouldn't be nice to know from.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#106:1>
I already mentioned to you that only one house help stayed with
us longer than expected.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#107:1>
And that is Besing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#108:1>
We have for the meantime three other house help.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#109:1>
And they are the following: Teopista ( gardener/ <indig> lavandera
</indig> ) , Rosalie ( all around house help), and Liselle ( <indig> yaya
</indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#110:1>
Well, this is all for now.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#111:1>
I 'll just call <indig> Tita </indig> Reggie to verify the news
about your coming home.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#112:1>
I have to prepare to go to work now.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#113:1>
WE LOVE AND MISS YOU.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#114:1>
BYE. </p>

March 6, 1995

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#117:2>
Dear Gloria,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#118:2>
Jojo has improved a lot in school since the 3rd quarter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#119:2>
From the 6th in line in their class - he 's now
#2 - with an average of 95.6.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#120:2>
His grades are 2-95 & 4-96. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#121:2>
Last Friday, JM & I went to see the Cultural Show participated
by the Prep - Grade 4.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#122:2>
Jojo again sang & did the action pretty well - with confidence and
grace.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#123:2>
He only decided to join the show last Feb.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#124:2>
Joey & I respected Jojo 's decision not to join the show way back
Nov. 94.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#125:2>
The &ldquo; theme &rdquo; of the show &ldquo; Voices that Care
&rdquo; is a message to all to save our Planet Earth from pollution, preserve
the forest, save the fishes & animals, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#126:2>
Jojo is depicting as a rabbit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#127:2>
I hope to send you his picture taken by Mrs. Mel O&ntilde;ate - his
class teacher & adviser.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#128:2>
She is all praises to Jojo.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#129:2>
She told me that he has the potential to make it to the top if he
really try harder.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#130:2>
His quizzes & Posttests this 4th quarter are practically perfect.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#131:2>
From Mon. to Fri. I check on his assignment & Jojo study after
breakfast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#132:2>
Last month was a hard time for us at home.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#133:2>
Eden left Jan. 31.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#134:2>
The new <indig> yaya </indig> also went home Feb. 10 because her
mother had a heart attack.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#135:2>
Her parents also recalled our new housemaid.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#136:2>
Only Besing hold the fort for more than two weeks.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#137:2>
I had to attend fully to the boys & also run the washing machine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#138:2>
It 's a good thing <indig> Comadre </indig> Lourdes gave us a
temporary helper Mar. 1 until end of March.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#139:2>
Eden also visit us now & then & it 's another blessing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#140:2>
I prevailed on her to work with us again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#141:2>
She came back March 3 - after over a month vacation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#142:2>
Jong is going to the States by March 18 for a 3 mos. vacation -
she will stay with her younger brother &ldquo; Nonoy &rdquo; in Maryland.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#143:2>
I 'll write the address & tel. no. next mail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#144:2>
Mi&ntilde;a was also here in Bacolod last Feb. 20 until Feb. 27.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#145:2>
She came to give moral support to Bingbong & family because <indig>
Tiay </indig> Bennet was seriously ill.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#146:2>
Mi&ntilde;a stayed with Bingbong at the house of Tinggay.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#147:2>
Bingbong celebrated Mi&ntilde;as birthday Feb. 25 with a <indig>
lechonada </indig> lunch.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#148:2>
We all went to join them.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#149:2>
The boys made a good impression with their <indig> Titas </indig>
especially the talkative JM.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#150:2>
I hope Lilliana Desini, Bingbong 's daughter, will remember to send
the hand me down clothes & toys for JM. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#151:2>
March 8

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#152:2>
We also attended Digol 's hearty <indig> Lechonada </indig>
dinner.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#153:2>
We had a full outing on Edsa 's Day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#154:2>
Jojo will perform again tomorrow & the next Friday March 17.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#155:2>
Joey will be able to see his son in action tomorrow.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#156:2>
It 's his Day off! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#157:2>
Jojo asked me to write to you what he likes on his birthday - a
Spider man or these Street Fighter Warriors.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#158:2>
A small version of these figure costs &peso;150 here & a cheap made
in Taiwan or China.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#159:2>
Perhaps you can send it thru Dolly Gordon since it 's only a small
package, which she can insert among her clothes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#160:2>
If it 's cheaper there - made of good material & a bigger version
like the size of his &ldquo; Dragon Bull &rdquo; - please buy for me 4
warriors & charge it on me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#161:2>
Jojo deserves a nice gift for Academic honor & his birthday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#162:2>
I suggest don't buy them a battery operated toys.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#163:2>
I 'm sending you a picture of these toys.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#164:2>
Any of the fighters will do but with preference on the &ldquo; mark
&rdquo; ones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#165:2>
Inspite of the ups & downs in the household - with God 's
blessing we are all fine. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#166:2>
Love,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-001#167:2>
Mom </I>
