<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#2:1>
THE office of the Press Secretary is apparently implementing at
this point a policy of <quote> 'less talk, less mistake' </quote> as part of
its strategy to reinvent President Estrada and arrest the drastic drop in his
popularity ratings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#3:1>
This is both good and bad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#4:1>
Good because in the first place, the President 's grasp of many
issues is severely circumscribed by his limited academic preparation for the
job.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#5:1>
Even if Mr. Estrada can say he is qualified to serve as President
because he has risen from the ranks from town mayor to senator and Vice
President before he assumed the highest position in the land, his capacity to
dissect profound issues from an intellectual viewpoint seems to be in serious
doubt.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#6:1>
The long and the short of it is that we have a President who is far
from cerebral, and tends to respond to issues at gut-level.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#7:1>
Hence, the <quote> 'less talk, less mistake' </quote> policy is apt,
and is a good move that will keep him from putting his foot in his mouth far
too often, with disastrous consequences not just for his image but that of
the nation as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#8:1>
But it is also bad because the people - the very ones who voted
him into office - expect him to do the talking for them.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#9:1>
That is, they expect Mr. Estrada to clarify for them how the Mindanao
crisis should be handled, what the economic managers are doing to improve the
economy, and where the nation is headed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#10:1>
If the Cabinet secretaries and their subalterns are the ones
defending the government 's stand on these and other vital issues, the
President 's image as the leader of the nation is considerably diminished.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#11:1>
The <quote> 'less talk, less mistake' </quote> posture may be needed
to keep the President 's off-the-cuff - and often off-kilter - comments on
important issues in check, but we 're afraid it merely reinforces the notion
that the electorate voted into office someone whose intellectual capacity and
competence to lead the nation forward are severely wanting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#12:1>
The <quote> 'less talk, less mistake' </quote> policy may be good
from the point of view of reviving the President 's popularity ratings, but
it spells disaster for the nation when the clear need is for a leader who can
articulate the aspirations of our people and solve their problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#13:1>
We do not need a President who does not want to talk about the
problems of cronyism and corruption in the country because he is likely to
say the wrong things. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#14:1>
We need a President who is forthright and firm in saying that he
will combat cronyism and corruption without fear or favor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#15:1>
We need a President who can tell us in clear terms what must be
done to arrest the decline of the economy, and how poverty must be
eradicated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#16:1>
In other words, we need a President who can talk sense because he
is on the side of truth. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Rational Metro development </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#18:2>
HOW to realize the vision of making Metro Manila truly a
world-class metropolis? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#19:2>
If the Metro Manila Development Authority had its way, the city
can rationalize its development only if all funds and disbursements, as well
as financing investment plans, are centralized in the agency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#20:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We are striving to integrate and synchronize the
planning and budgeting systems in the metropolis at all levels of government,
from the national, the metro and down to the local level, &rdquo; </quote>
says MMDA chair Jejomar Binay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#21:2>
The synchronization will include all annual investments in the
National Capital Region of all the cities and municipalities and the national
government.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#22:2>
This would be part of the Regional Development Plan for the National
Capital Region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#23:2>
The plan covers all the aspects of the development of Metro
Manila, which include utilities, roads, transport, flood control, land
development, environment, social services, and development administration.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#24:2>
An integral component of the plan is the preparation of the Metro
Manila Investment Program.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#25:2>
This seeks direct control over the annual investment plans of
national agencies, cities and municipalities, especially on all
infrastructure projects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#26:2>
What the MMDA really wants to do is to synchronize all
development efforts so that they converge in one direction: a Metro Manila
that we can all call our home.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#27:2>
As things now stand, we have pockets of affluence, surrounded by
squatter colonies; uncollected garbage; horrible traffic jams; severe air and
water pollution, to name just a few. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#28:2>
While the centralization of planning and funding under the MMDA
ensures that taxpayers ' money only goes to priority socio-economic projects,
we doubt if the local government units would easily surrender their power
over the purse.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#29:2>
The elected officials in the LGUs can always invoke the fact that,
having been chosen by their constituents to serve them, they are in the best
position to determine what is best for them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#30:2>
We believe that rational Metro development is possible only if
both national government agencies and LGUs in Metro Manila get their heads
together and hammer out an integrated and coherent plan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#31:2>
But it does not end there.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#32:2>
The key question is: Does the MMDA itself have the capability to
implement long-term development plans, given that its performance over the
years in giving us the city that we deserve certainly leaves much to be
desired? </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Untimely visit </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#34:3>
PRESIDENT Joseph Estrada goes on a state visit to China with the
domestic front in turmoil. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#35:3>
While a state visit such as this involves a lot of preparation
and cannot be cancelled without affecting bilateral diplomatic relations in
some way or other, we believe the serious political crisis brought about by
the all-out war in Mindanao compounded by two hostage situations in Basilan
and Sulu should have been prioritized by Malaca&ntilde;ang rather than our
ties with China. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#36:3>
From where we sit, however, we do not see any possibility that
the Chinese would change their position on their claim to the Spratlys.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#37:3>
That is, if the issue is discussed at all during the visit.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#38:3>
The most that Mr. Estrada could probably get from his Chinese hosts
is a guarantee that they are willing to continue talks for a peaceful
resolution of the territorial dispute.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#39:3>
This is nothing new, however, because this is what the Chinese have
been saying even as they continue strengthening their fortifications in the
Spratlys. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#40:3>
The second item in the agenda of the visit is to encourage the
Chinese to invest in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#41:3>
And for this reason, some 150 Fil-Chinese businessmen are said to be
part of the presidential entourage.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#42:3>
We seriously doubt, however, if the Chinese are willing to bring
money here when right in their own country they need the investments
themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#43:3>
China has become a regional economic power not because its
businessmen invest abroad but because many foreign companies have been
attracted to make huge investments there.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#44:3>
And we would not be surprised if it 's the other way around: that the
150 Fil-Chinese businessmen who are accompanying the President would be
enticed to invest in China.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#45:3>
With the unstable political situation in the Philippines at present,
local businessmen cannot be faulted for looking elsewhere to put their
investments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#46:3>
We are not saying that the China visit is absolutely pointless.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#47:3>
We have no doubt that it will strengthen RP-China ties in both
political and economic terms.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#48:3>
But weighed against the urgent need to address pressing domestic
concerns, specifically the Mindanao crisis, the state visit could have waited
for an opportune time - and achievable results. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> The cost of war </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#50:4>
HOW much would it cost the government to win the war against the
<indig> Moro </indig> Islamic Liberation Front? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#51:4>
About &peso;4 billion, according to the defense department and
the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#52:4>
Of that sum, &peso;2 billion would go to war materi&eacute;l, such as
equipment and ammunition of government troops, and &peso;2 billion would go
to the salaries and provisions of soldiers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#53:4>
House Minority Leader Sergio Apostol cites a much lesser figure,
however.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#54:4>
He says only &peso;1.8 billion is enough to continue the offensive of
government troops, given an estimated total of 30,000 government soldiers
fighting the MILF.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#55:4>
And if the military runs out of funds to pursue the secessionist
rebels, government can submit a request to Congress to supplement their
budget. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#56:4>
We can see here the big difference between what the military
wants and what is deemed realistic by Congress.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#57:4>
By any measure, the &peso;.2 billion difference is a big sum that can
be used, for instance, to kickstart the socio-economic development of
Muslim-dominated areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#58:4>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado has revealed that as of now
they do not really know how much the government has already spent in the
military operation in Mindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#59:4>
<quote> &ldquo; We have not bothered to compute it because we 're
busy planning and thinking how we could stop the rebellion in the South.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#60:4>
This revelation is consistent with his earlier statement to the
effect that you do not put a price tag on the country 's territorial
integrity.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#61:4>
That might be true from the theoretical plane, but in reality the
soldiers cannot use up all the ammunition they want without considering that
every round costs money - taxpayer 's money - and that the national treasury
is not inexhaustible.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#62:4>
Somehow, the cost of war must be counted in pesos and centavos,
because the same taxpayers ' money used in fighting a war can very well be
used to securing the peace that Filipinos want. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#63:4>
We believe that it is correct to unleash the full might of the
State against terrorist groups like the Abu Sayyaf who have the bad habit of
kidnapping innocent civilians.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#64:4>
But obviously the government cannot be involved in a long drawn-out
war with the MILF while avenues to peace remain open. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#65:4>
The economics of war should tell us that peace is the better
option. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#66:5>
<h> <bold> Rein them in </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#67:5>
WITH close to 200 local and foreign journalists covering the
hostage drama in Sulu - and most of the foreigners ' accounts painting a very
negative picture of the country - perhaps it is time for the government to
put some semblance of order amid the chaos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#68:5>
The foreign journalists who have descended in droves to Sulu may
be contributing to the problem instead of helping solve it.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#69:5>
In their eagerness to bring to the outside world what the hostages
are going through, the foreign journalists are likely to criticize the
Philippine government and the military for their failure to end the crisis.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#70:5>
But that is not all.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#71:5>
There is a very real danger that the so-called <mention> 'lost
commands' </mention> of the <indig> Moro </indig> rebel groups could seize
the foreign journalists.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#72:5>
Groups of intrepid journalists have been setting off on their own to
go to the Abu Sayyaf headquarters, causing undue worry and apprehension - to
the Philippine government and perhaps their own governments - that they too
might have been abducted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#73:5>
The foreign journalists are also said to have offered the Abu
Sayyaf rebels money for the chance to interview the hostages.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#74:5>
This could unnecessarily prolong the crisis because the Abu Sayyaf
just might milk the situation dry for all it 's worth - they need all the
money they can get to sustain their terrorist activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#75:5>
In light of this, we suggest that authorities impose order in the
coverage of the hostage crisis.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#76:5>
First, there should be daily briefings for the press by the
officially designated government spokesperson, so that the facts can be
immediately communicated to all concerned.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#77:5>
We have in mind something similar to what took place during the
Kosovo crisis, when NATO held such daily briefings for the press. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#78:5>
Second, it should be made clear that the government will not be
responsible for the safety of foreign journalists who wander off into the
jungle by themselves to interview the foreign hostages of the Abu Sayyaf.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#79:5>
We are not in any way asking that government restrict the
movement of the foreign journalists, much less the local ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#80:5>
What we are suggesting is that government take firm steps to prevent
further damage to the country 's already tarnished international reputation.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#81:5>
It is within government 's prerogative to set the rules regarding
coverage of a complicated situation.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-008#82:5>
What is happening in the twin hostage crises in Basilan and Sulu must
be made known to the world - but at our own terms, not those of foreign media
organizations. </p> </I>
