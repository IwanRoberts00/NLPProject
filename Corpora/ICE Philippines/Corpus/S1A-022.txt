Hi Patneb
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#2:1:A>
By the way what are your plans for this summer

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#3:1:B>
I don't know yet but I 'm really planning to go to a beach and go swimming or go to Tagaytay or Baguio anywhere cold as long as I can go out on a picnic and I 'm also thinking of going and getting a summer job

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#4:1:A>
Well that 's a great idea

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#5:1:B>
Yeah because I need extra cash because my Mom won't give me any allowance this summer so I need to earn money to be able to go out
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#6:1:B>
How about you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#7:1:B>
What are your plans

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#8:1:A>
Well as of now I have plenty of plans <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#9:1:A>
I want to go to Baguio I want to go to Boracay I want to go to Palawan and I want to go to Bacolod
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#10:1:A>
But definitely I 'm going to Bacolod maybe in the second week of April
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#11:1:A>
Of course I miss my hometown hometown already

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#12:1:B>
Yeah and who will you go with

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#13:1:A>
Well my brother can't go home <,> because he has practices I don't know but he has to practice for his <{> <[> football </[> you know football games this summer

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#14:1:B>
<[> Varsity </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#15:1:A>
Well maybe I 'm <.> goin </.> going home alone

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#16:1:B>
Wow that 's exciting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#17:1:B>
Are you gonna ride an airplane alone

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#18:1:A>
I experienced that for many times already
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#19:1:A>
Well if you 're from Bacolod you have to face the reality that you 're going to ride a plane just by yourself

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#20:1:B>
Really I 've never I 've never ridden a plane alone

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#21:1:A>
Ooohhh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#22:1:B>
Promise I haven't <{> <[> really </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#23:1:A>
<[> You must try </[> </{> you must try it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#24:1:B>
I 'm scared

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#25:1:A>
Yeah it 's really scary at first but after you 'll get used to it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#26:1:B>
Well you got a point but if you 're going to Boracay can I come with you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#27:1:A>
Sure any time but I 'm not yet sure but my cousins want to go to Boracay so I wanna go also because it 's been how many years that I 've I 've been there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#28:1:A>
So I just want to go back there again and well enjoy the beach the white sand and the clear water

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#29:1:B>
At least you 've been there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#30:1:B>
I 've never been there before I 've just heard stories about it and then and then I wanna see it for myself and see if it 's really a good beach <{> <[> but </[> I think it is

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#32:1:A>
<[> <indig> Oo </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#33:1:A>
I pity you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#34:1:A>
Well you have to go

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#35:1:B>
Yeah <,> so if if ever you 're planning to go there this <{> <[> summer </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#36:1:A>
<[> Yeah I 'll call </[> </{> you I 'll call you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#37:1:B>
Tell me please

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#38:1:A>
Yeah I 'll call you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#39:1:A>
How about Palawan yeah but

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#40:1:B>
Yeah I want to go to Palawan too because they say the view there is spectacular but I 'm scared of the malaria

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#41:1:A>
<O> stutter </O> Are there is I don't know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#42:1:B>
Outbreak there 's a malaria outbreak I think somewhere there <.> an </.> and I don't wanna have a malaria
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#43:1:B>
I I just came out from a German measles and then I 'm gonna have malaria isn't that too much sickness in one <{> <[> year </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#44:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> I believe the beaches in Palawan are better than Boracay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#45:1:B>
Yeah but

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#46:1:A>
They 're cleaner they 're cleaner the water cleaner clearer and everything

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#47:1:B>
But but at least in Boracay it 's really <{> <[> a resort </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#48:1:A>
<[> Civilized </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#49:1:B>
Yeah the service sort type of island
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#50:1:B>
Unlike in Palawan it 's more of a forest and jungle type

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#51:1:A>
Actually Boracay it 's <,> it 's like a city in a beach
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#52:1:A>
That 's the setting it 's like a city in a beach

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#53:1:B>
And then there 's night life also

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#54:1:A>
Yeah there is yeah oh God

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#55:1:B>
<O> stutter </O> Better in <{> <[> Boracay </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#56:1:A>
<[> Night life in </[> </{> Boracay is very fun

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#57:1:B>
Yeah <{> <[> and even more foreigners </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#58:1:A>
<[> And there is even </[> </{> golf courses
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#59:1:A>
Imagine there 's even golf courses <{> <[> in the beach </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#60:1:B>
<[> And we could </[> </{> meet foreigners <O> laughs </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#61:1:A>
<indig> Ay </indig> no <,> <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#62:1:B>
How about uh what was your most memorable vacation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#63:1:A>
Me well I guess my most memorable vacation was when the first time I went to the States with my family
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#64:1:A>
I think I was around ten years old
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#65:1:A>
Yeah I really enjoyed Disneyland Magic Mountain Knottsberry Farm and all those amusement parks
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#66:1:A>
Uh yeah I remember uh <,> I went to I went to Lake Tahoe and that was the first time I touched the snow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#67:1:A>
Wow it was so fantastic

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#68:1:B>
I envy you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#69:1:B>
I 've never seen snow and I 've never been to the States

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#70:1:A>
Well I guess your time will come just wait for it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#71:1:B>
Yeah well at least my sister went there and my Mom and my Dad except me and my brother

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#72:1:A>
Why don't you go with them

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#73:1:B>
No it was in different occasions I mean my Mom went there alone for <{1> <[1> the wedding </[1> of her sister my Dad went there <{2> <[2> on business trip </[2> my sister went there alone for her birthday gift in her eighteenth birthday gift

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#74:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#75:1:A>
<[2> That 's why </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#76:1:A>
Why don't you convince your parents to give you the money and

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#77:1:B>
Uh we don't have the money <O> laughs </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#78:1:A>
As of now

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#79:1:B>
Yeah as of now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#80:1:B>
Maybe if I 'm <.> wor </.> if I after I graduate when I 'm working already and I 'm earning my own money I 'll probably <{> <[> visit </[> the States

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#81:1:A>
<[> <.> Ye </.> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#82:1:A>
Yeah <&> break in recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#83:1:A>
How about you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#84:1:A>
What 's your most memorable vacation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#85:1:B>
Well I guess my most memorable vacation was when I was in third year high school and we went home to our province in Romblon <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#86:1:B>
I was with my <indig> titas </indig> and <indig> titos </indig> but they 're almost the same age in their in their early twenties during that time so they 're more of the <,> teenager touch but not really
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#87:1:B>
They 're like the yuppies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#88:1:B>
And then we went to our house in front in the house in front of the beach

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#89:1:A>
Wow <{> <[> it was beautiful </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#90:1:B>
<[> And it 's like </[> </{> our sort of private beach because there 's nobody there just us and our house is isolated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#91:1:B>
It 's it it 's in it 's it 's surrounded by forests and

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#92:1:A>
Was it the first time that you went there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#93:1:B>
No I went there when I was still little <indig> e </indig> <{> <[> but </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#94:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#95:1:B>
It was the most memorable because we had fun we were we were swimming we were joking around we sleep in a hut <.> be </.> instead of the house we 'd sleep in the hut because we 'd tell scary stories at night before we go to sleep
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#96:1:B>
And then in the morning we eat <indig> pandesal </indig> and Milo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#97:1:B>
<indig> Hay </indig> those were the days

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#98:1:A>
Yeah so sad to hear but but I guess you can do it again you can experience it again

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#100:1:B>
Yeah <{> <[> it 's been </[> a long time since I went back to the province

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#101:1:A>
<[> But if </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#102:1:A>
But you know what
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#103:1:A>
If you 're going to think of it Philippines is a lot of great places uh better than the <.> oth </.> better than going out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#104:1:B>
Yeah the better than abroad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#105:1:B>
We 've got better <{1> <[1> beaches </[1> I think <{2> <[2> and </[2> better uh vacation spots

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#106:1:A>
<[1> Beach </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#107:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#108:1:A>
But you know the problem is they 're so expensive

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#109:1:B>
Yeah it 's it 's as expensive as going to the States almost as expensive as going to <{> <[> the States </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#110:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> the rates are really expensive uhm it 's better if you 'll go to Hong Kong instead of going to Palawan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#111:1:A>
It 's more cheaper and that 's <.> chea </.> that 's a reality I 'm not joking

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#112:1:B>
Yeah I know but well no not all of us get the chance to to visit every island in the Philippines every tourist spot in the Philippines so I guess it 's just <,> someone 's luck to go everywhere around the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#113:1:B>
How about you Pam

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#114:1:A>
I believe the you know what I believe they must give special rates for Filipinos

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#115:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#116:1:A>
Don't you <{> <[> think </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#117:1:B>
<[> Like </[> </{> discount

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#118:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#119:1:B>
Discounted rates
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#120:1:B>
Yeah because this is our country we should have been <.> enjoyi </.> I mean like what they 're saying we should first visit or get around our country than plan on going out abroad because the Philippines has better places to visit this week this summer time

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#121:1:A>
And I guess it <.> ju </.> the problem with the Philippines is that <,> most of the Filipinos still loves to go out

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#122:1:B>
Yeah they prefer to go abroad than stay in this country not knowing that we have better places
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#123:1:B>
Like in Batangas there are many beaches which are better than those in the States
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#124:1:B>
Like my uncle who 's an American himself didn't like a beach in North Carolina I guess and he doesn't want he 's not sure of visiting the Philippines because he 's not <.> su </.> he doesn't want to see I mean he wants to see a beach that is very nice not like the one he saw in the States and to think he 's already an American and he 's doubting the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#125:1:B>
I told my <indig> tita </indig> that she <.> shou </.> she should bring her husband to Boracay or to <.> Bat </.> at least either in <.> e </.> even in Batangas 'cause our beaches are far better than in the States

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#126:1:A>
And <,> look at it Hollywood stars are going to Amanpulo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#127:1:A>
<{> <[> Imagine </[> going to our own beach Hollywood stars

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#128:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#129:1:B>
Yeah they 're not contented with their own and we Filipino are not contented <{> <[> of what we have yeah </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#130:1:B>
We prefer to go <,> to the States to Europe

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#131:1:A>
<[> Of what we have yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#132:1:A>
I guess it 's part of our mental

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#133:1:B>
Mentality

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#134:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> so </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#135:1:B>
<[> So </[> </{> we want to be like others like the foreigners we <,> we think that it 's more <,> prestigious or something

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#136:1:A>
I guess it 's uh it 's the effect of our colonial mentality

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#137:1:B>
Yeah you can say it <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#138:1:A>
It 's really sad

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#139:1:B>
Hey how will we by the way will we how will we do our solicitations for ESA <&> European Studies Association </&> this summer

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#140:1:A>
Well I guess we have to meet first with the ESA with the other ESA officials and after that we should arrange the <.> sponsorsh </.> sponsorships packages and I guess after that we can go around Manila to get sponsors

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#141:1:B>
Well that 's a good idea
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#142:1:B>
You know I really want the Euro-tour to push through next summer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#143:1:B>
I really want to go to Europe

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#144:1:A>
It 's really educational
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#145:1:A>
My Mom even told me that if I let 's say if I 'll go to to Europe I should go with my friends not with my family

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#146:1:B>
Yeah you 'll enjoy it more

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#147:1:A>
Yeah and it 's more exciting if you 'll go with your friends and

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#148:1:B>
And besides we 're studying it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#149:1:B>
So it means we 'll get a a glimpse of what we 're studying of what we 're talking about in the classroom not just imagining in our minds what what does this place look like at least we can get first-hand info or first-hand picture of what

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#150:1:A>
We can really feel the ambiance <{> <[> of Europe </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#151:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> and when we when we go back to school in June it would be really exciting 'cause we could share stuffs that we we learned from our tour

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#152:1:A>
Yeah I hope we can go I really hope that 's why we have to work hard

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#154:1:B>
Yeah to get sponsors

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#155:1:A>
Yeah we have to we have to get a lot of sponsors from rich companies

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#156:1:B>
Yeah so they could support us when we go on tour
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#157:1:B>
What which countries do you want to go to when we go on the Euro-tour

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#158:1:A>
Well I guess I want to go to Paris the usual things

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#159:1:B>
In France

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#160:1:A>
I want to go to Paris France uhm Greece also I like to go to Greece

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#161:1:B>
Spain

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#162:1:A>
Yeah Spain yeah

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#163:1:B>
You 're studying Spanish you should want to go to Spain and <{> <[> wanna practice our language </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#164:1:A>
<[> And I think </[> </{> we can apply <{> <[> our </[> Spanish language

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#165:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#166:1:A>
Even though we 're not that fluent <{> <[> but </[> at least we 'll get

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#167:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#168:1:B>
We know something I mean we know the basics

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-022#169:1:A>
Yeah that 's good
