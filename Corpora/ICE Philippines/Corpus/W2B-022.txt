<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#3:1>
MURUROA 's clock is winding down. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#4:1>
France will resume its nuclear weapons tests in September after
ending a test ban moratorium enacted by then-president Francois Mitterrand in
1992.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#5:1>
Next month, the administration of newly elected French President
Jacques Chirac will press the button that will trigger one of the largest
underground explosions in recent memory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#6:1>
This explosion, however, will not be measured in kilotons nor by
the way it will make the Earth shudder.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#7:1>
This explosion started in June when France announced its test
schedule.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#8:1>
This explosion came in the form of global protestations which rocked
the French government, an explosion of protest whose booming cries echoed
around the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#9:1>
And here in the Philippines, the explosion is heard loud and
clear.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#10:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Fallout is going to be the most critical effect of
the tests, especially since we are closer to the test site than France is,
&rdquo; </quote> Science and Technology Secretary William Padolina told the
<mention> INQUIRER </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#11:1>
Padolina said fallout effects will depend on wind currents and
other atmospheric conditions every time France undertakes a nuclear test.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#12:1>
As explained by Carey Sublette on the Internet 's <mention>
&ldquo; Nuclear Weapons--Frequently Asked Questions, &rdquo; </mention>
fallout is a complex mixture of radioactive isotopes, the composition of
which changes as each isotope decays into other isotopes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#13:1>
Sublette said many isotopes - - atoms that are either stable or
radioactive - - make significant contributions to the overall radiation
level.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#14:1>
Radiation from some isotopes emerge as particular long-term hazards.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#15:1>
But how exactly does radiation damage occur?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#16:1>
In other words, how does radiation cause cancer? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#17:1>
The <mention> Earthsavers Movement </mention> explains that
radiation and nuclear test pollutants can be taken in by fish or humans
through inhalation, bathing, drinking, eating or through open wounds.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#18:1>
These pollutants can then be incorporated into bones, muscles or
other organs where they can continue to irradiate cells for a long time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#19:1>
When radiation enters your body, there is a chance it will
intersect with one of your cells.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#20:1>
Inside any cell is a nucleus, which contains chromosomes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#21:1>
If the radiation happens to pass into the cell nucleus, one of four
things can happen.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#22:1>
All four types of exposure subject cells to risk.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#23:1>
In order of decreasing probability, these exposure types are:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#24:1>
1) Radiation goes right through the cell and no interaction occurs;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#25:1>
2) Radiation does irreparable destruction and cell dies;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#26:1>
3) Radiation does damage to nucleus.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#27:1>
Cell survives in this damaged state.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#28:1>
After it repetitively divides, it grows into a solid tumor.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#29:1>
Cancer begins.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#30:1>
4) Radiation does repairable damage, and cell returns to normal state
( very low probability). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#31:1>
There are three major theories - - all set by physicians - - as
to how radiation damages living tissue.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#32:1>
These theories, however, are approximations, and based on broad
assumptions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#33:1>
<h> <bold> * The threshold hypothesis. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#34:1>
This asserts that there exists a safe level of radiation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#35:1>
If the dose is low, then the cell repair rate is of the order of the
damage rate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#36:1>
Hence, you get no resultant damage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#37:1>
<h> <bold> * The linear hypothesis. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#38:1>
Under this theory, you would expect one malignant cancer per 1000
person-REMs ( Roentgen Equivalent Man, a unit of radiation dose equivalent).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#39:1>
For example, you would find one cancerous patient if you expose 500
people to two REMs, or 10,000 people to 0.1 REMs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#40:1>
<h> <bold> * The supralinear hypothesis. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#41:1>
The main result here is that for low doses, you get more cancer cases
per person-REM than at high doses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#42:1>
The theory states that you don't get more radiation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#43:1>
Instead, you get more damaged but surviving cells. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#44:1>
The <mention> Earthsavers Movement </mention> maintains that
radiation from the French nuclear tests will affect not only the French
Polynesian area but adjacent areas as well - - even the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#45:1>
The Philippines is only 9,000 km from Mururoa.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#46:1>
In comparison, the test site is 24,000 km from Paris. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#47:1>
But France has reiterated that proximity is not the issue here.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#48:1>
French presidential adviser Andre Giraud, a former French defense
minister, said it was regrettable that French nuclear testing in the Pacific
has caused a tidal wave of protests.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#49:1>
He insisted, however, that the tests have nothing to do with other
countries. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#X50:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We are in France in Mururoa, thousands of miles from
other countries. </X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#51:1>
I would say mind your business, &rdquo; </quote> said Giraud, who
headed the <foreign> Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique </foreign> from 1970
to 1978. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#52:1>
Padolina said the Philippines is wary of the effects of any
nuclear test, and that radiation measurements are closely being monitored.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#53:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We have our detectors ready to measure changes in
radiation levels," </quote> he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#54:1>
<quote> &ldquo; In fact, radiation levels in the country have been
monitored for quite a while now.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#55:1>
All we can do now is to support the protest of the administration - -
and the protest of other countries - - against the French nuclear tests.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#56:1>
The French argue that minimal and non-lethal levels of radiation
will be emitted by the tests since the explosion will be triggered 1,008
meters below the ground. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#57:1>
<mention> Greenpeace </mention> activists counter, however, that
there is no safe level of radiation exposure. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#58:1>
The ecological consequences of the French nuclear tests may be
hazy due to a lack of concrete data on their possible effects.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#59:1>
Solid proof of the tests ' ecological damage on the Pacific islands -
- if any - - has yet to be offered.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#60:1>
The tests ' potential harm to the global food chain has also been
dismissed as futuristic and purely hypothetical. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#61:1>
The emotional tide of the possible damage the nuclear tests could
do continues to crash on the shores of France in a tidal wave of protests.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#62:1>
Yet, the environmental side of the issue is slowly being
relegated to the background.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#63:1>
France now sees the issue as a political rather than an environmental
one.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#64:1>
<X> <quote> &ldquo; If anyone put that pressure on the US or Russia,
do you think they would stop? </X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#65:1>
There is no way we would stop," </quote> said French nuclear
physicist Alain Barthoux. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#66:1>
In short, France 's decision to press the nuclear trigger has
been reduced to a matter of politics rather than being made on the bases of
global ecological welfare. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Countdown </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#68:2>
<h> <bold> 34 days before the French nuclear tests </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#69:2>
<bold> Leo Magno </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#70:2>
THIRTY-FOUR days from now, on Sept. 15, France will resume its
underground nuclear tests beneath the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa in
French Polynesia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#71:2>
Thirty-four hundred years from now the children of France - - and
probably the children of every nation - - will know whether that decision was
right or wrong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#72:2>
On June 13, the French government announced it would resume
nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#73:2>
These &ldquo; last &rdquo; few tests will be conducted between
September and May next year, before the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty in 1996. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#74:2>
France was slapped with protests, and petitions to stop them
lashed at the French government like raindrops on hot, arid earth.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#75:2>
Dozens of petitions - - with tens of thousands of signatories - -
riddled the wires of the Internet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#76:2>
Mounting pressure forced France to lessen the number of tests
from eight to seven, but the government refused to stop the nuclear clock.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#77:2>
Nuclear physicists handpicked by the government fueled the fire when
they reported that no traces of excess radioactivity within the test sites
were found.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#78:2>
They added that smoking is more likely to produce cancer in humans
than swimming in the area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#79:2>
However, French defense department documents released Aug. 2 have
shown that at least three nuclear tests have caused radioactive contamination
in the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#80:2>
These sites, the documents show, have been contaminated over years of
underground testing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#81:2>
France conducted its first atmospheric nuclear test in Algeria in
1960.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#82:2>
From 1960-1966, 17 tests were conducted in the Pacific test site,
including four in the atmosphere and 13 underground.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#83:2>
From 1966 to 1992, 175 nuclear tests were detected in the Pacific
test site, including 44 atmospheric tests ( 39 at Mururoa, five at
Fangataufa), and 131 underground tests ( 123 at Mururoa, eight at
Fangataufa). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#84:2>
In 1992, then president Francois Mitterrand imposed a moratorium
on nuclear weapons testing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#85:2>
Three years later under a new administration, the French government
announced the resumption of nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#86:2>
Other environmental missions support the French defense
department findings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#87:2>
In 1983, a six-man mission inspected the Mururoa area and found that
the Mururoa atoll is sinking prematurely.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#88:2>
The mission also discovered that water in underground test sites
contains radioactive elements.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#89:2>
These elements may spread to the waters of the Pacific and affect the
entire food chain, the study concluded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#90:2>
However, government physicists contend that fish will have to
digest a huge amount of plutonium for them to be toxic to humans. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#91:2>
The issue of defining the level by which radioactivity can be
harmful to humans is now being addressed by a global union of physicists.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#92:2>
In an open letter posted Wednesday on the Internet, the Committee for
Research and Independent Information on Radioactivity ( CRII-RAD), an
independent association of nuclear specialists, challenged the findings of
France that underground nuclear testing has minimal effects on the
environment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#93:2>
The CRII-RAD 's headquarters is in Valence, France.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#94:2>
The group has been instrumental in averting global environmental
dangers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#95:2>
CRII-RAD gave this alert when the Chernobyl radioactive cloud passed
over France. </p>

radioactivity, through the creation of new radioactive substances," </quote>
CRII-RAD declared. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#98:2>
The CRII-RAD added that repeated explosions have created, in the

Contrary to what has been stated, the French scientists called in

CRII-RAD requested Wednesday the permission to organize a study

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#106:2>
The authorization, they said, should clearly stipulate that the
military authorities will allow access to all parts of the atoll, allow them

necessary. </p> <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#114:3>
So said with finality Dr. Carlito Aleta, director of the
Department of Science and Technology 's Philippine Nuclear Research
Institute.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#115:3>
The PNRI is the country 's authority on nuclear energy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#116:3>
The PNRI has repeatedly been invited to hearings by Senators
Francisco Tatad and Heherson Alvarez since France announced in June that it
would continue testing nuclear weapons in French Polynesia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#117:3>
The Senate wanted to find out the possible effects of the French and
Chinese nuclear tests on the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#118:3>
Aleta said the PNRI and the Senate were inevitably driven to
ground zero: effects or no effects, France will detonate its test bombs next
month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#119:3>
This was confirmed Thursday by French government spokesperson
Francois Baroin, who said that President Jacques Chirac is adamant on
following the scheduled tests. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#120:3>
On Wednesday, Congress approved a resolution condemning the
French and Chinese nuclear tests.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#121:3>
The bottomline, it appears, is that all that can be done now is to
condemn and protest the action. </p>

<h> <bold> The French agenda </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#123:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Nuclear weapons testing is done for three
primary reasons, &rdquo; </quote> Aleta said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#124:3>
<quote> &ldquo; First, to test a new weapon; second, to find out the
bomb 's effects to people and property; and third, as a safety test,
especially when the bombs have been on the stockpile for a long period and
you want to see if they still work. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#125:3>
Of these three reasons, President Chirac justified his
administration 's action based on the third - - that France is doing the test
merely to check the reliability of its aging arsenal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#126:3>
American scientists suspect, however, that France is conducting
its tests to develop new types of warhead.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#127:3>
Scientists say French officials are misleading the public when they
claim that a few more tests in Mururoa and Fangataufa will allow France to
simulate nuclear explosions by computer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#128:3>
The US said not even Washington has such a technology, and that
computer simulation is unlikely to replace actual nuclear testing. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#129:3>
<h> <bold> A lingering health issue </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#130:3>
Last week, China detonated an underground nuclear test in Lop
Nor, Xinjiang province, 2,400 km west of Beijng.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#131:3>
The bomb was the fourth detonated by China in the last 14 months.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#132:3>
In 20 days, France will pull its own nuclear trigger in Mururoa.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#133:3>
Although the biological effects of these underground tests are
poorly documented, reports have it that the areas of Xinjiang and Mururoa are
slowly being contaminated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-022#134:3>
There are reports of unusually high cancer rates at Chinese
