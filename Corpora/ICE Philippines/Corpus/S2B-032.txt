Mr President esteemed colleagues this is a privileged moment
for me to make history today together with all of you as we cast our vote in
what could either be the most glorious or the most ignominious way to welcome
the millennium
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#2:1:A>
This is also a moment of truth for me a golden opportunity to
finally bare my innermost thoughts and feelings indeed my very soul on an
issue whose resolution will mark a turning point in the destiny of our nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#3:1:A>
Arriving at a final decision did not come easy for me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#4:1:A>
It was something I carefully deliberated on earnestly prayed over
argued and discussed vigorously and even persistently debated over with those
whose wisdom and counsel I value most
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#5:1:A>
I have been warned cajoled pressured to take the beaten path to
follow the majority as nothing I could say or do can alter the equation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#6:1:A>
Indeed the weight of my resolve bears heavily upon me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#7:1:A>
For going against the grain I am disregarding the earnest pleas and
advice of family and friends including that of my beloved husband Tony all of
whom I dearly love honor and respect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#8:1:A>
As I cast my vote today Mr President I ask for their understanding
and compassion for I must vote the way my conscience dictates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#9:1:A>
Only then can I be worthy of my truly mandated task
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#10:1:A>
<indig> Mula nang ako ay pumalaot sa larangan ng pulitika naging
panuntunan ko na na isaalang-aalang ang kapakanan ng inang bayan higit pa po
sa sarili </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#11:1:A>
I could not see how I can be true to myself or to anyone especially
to the Filipino people who have placed their trust in me if I could not be
true to myself
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#12:1:A>
The die is cast Mr President and on this blessed day at five
thirteen I declare that I cannot in conscience give my concurrence to Senate
Resolution four four three
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#13:1:A>
Mr President I vote a resounding <mention> no </mention> to the
Visiting Forces Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#14:1:A>
<mention> No </mention> to an Agreement that is lamentably
unconstitutional no to a grossly flawed ominously vague and decidedly
one-sided Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#15:1:A>
I vote <mention> no </mention> Mr President to the Visiting Forces
Agreement because I believe it is unfair and oppressive to the Filipino
people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#16:1:A>
<indig> Hindi po ako sumasang-ayon sa isang kasunduang mapang-api
makapagpapahamak at walang idudulot na kabutihan sa sambayanang Pilipino
 </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#17:1:A>
My vote Mr President is a vote for national sovereignty that can
neither be waived nor compromised in order to give preferential treatment to
foreign troops or subordinated to any claim of national security or political
exigency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#18:1:A>
My vote is a vote for the Constitution and its unequivocal mandate
for a nuclear-free country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#19:1:A>
My vote is a vote for the environment an area of deep abiding and
personal concern so that we may avoid reliving the tragedy of the past
military bases which left behind a scourge of toxic contaminants that has
bred disease and death in many communities in the former base lands
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#20:1:A>
Mr President let us get it straight
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#21:1:A>
I am not against the Americans
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#22:1:A>
I am not even against a Visiting Forces Agreement but I am Mr
President and have always been strongly against the way this treaty is
presently drafted and worded
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#23:1:A>
I believe Mr President that this document is onerous and fatally
deficient in providing adequate protection for our own national interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#24:1:A>
Mr President I may not possess the legal brilliance of many of our
distinguished colleagues nor am I gifted with the advantage of age and
political experience but this I know Mr President that the Agreement violates
the Philippine Constitution both in letter and in spirit
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#25:1:A>
Therefore I cannot find honor in something that makes a farce of
all that we have been taught about the universal standards of fairness
justice law and equality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#26:1:A>
To borrow the words of one of the magnificent twelve who described
the rejected bases pact of nineteen ninety-one it is indeed a masterpiece of
vagueness as if it were a virtue to confuse our people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#27:1:A>
I humbly urge my senior colleagues to work for the renegotiation of
a new agreement for bilateral defense cooperation one where the provisions
are unmistakably fair clear and binding for both parties
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#28:1:A>
This we should do not only so that we may abide by our own
Constitution and our laws but more significantly so that we can keep our
dignity and self-respect as a people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#29:1:A>
We must not repeat the mistakes of the past
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#30:1:A>
We must not allow any more of our women to be raped
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#31:1:A>
Filipinos whom they denigratingly called scavengers to be used as
human targets by servicemen who have gone scot-free and what about the many
abandoned Amerasian children they all cry out for justice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#32:1:A>
<indig> Huwag po tayong magbingi-bingihan huwag po tayong
magbulag-bulagan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#33:1:A>
Let us also not forget that until now the United States whose
military forces have been described by <mention> Newsweek </mention> as the
most pervasive and the most protected polluter has ignored its legal and
international obligations to clean up the toxic waste which it has left
behind in its former military bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#34:1:A>
The destructive and debilitating toxic situation in Clark and Subic
must not must never be replicated in other areas of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#35:1:A>
The renewed onslaught of war games threaten to leave behind a trail
of similar devastation in our forests and mountains in our beaches and
wetlands
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#36:1:A>
I have been Mr President to some of the thirty sites identified by
various studies as heavily contaminated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#37:1:A>
I saw hapless children born with missing fingers and deformed
bodies and young lives slowly and painfully being consumed by cancer
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#38:1:A>
I heard their mothers cry and plead for deliverance from this
harrowing nightmare
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#39:1:A>
The residents of these communities live each day struggling to
survive against the very elements that they need to exist the water they
drink the air they breathe the land where they grow their crops and where
their homes are built
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#40:1:A>
The sight the sound and the stench of death and disease hang
heavily upon them and all we can do to assuage their grief is to demand that
the U S be made to take responsibility for its actions and make reparation
under the polluter must pay principle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#41:1:A>
After today Mr President I will continue to take up the cudgels to
press for the clean-up of the former military bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#42:1:A>
Months ago I have written Sen John Sheffield the head of the U S
Senate Environment Committee about the problems and I received a reply last
April twelve that they will study the matter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#43:1:A>
I trust that even after my adverse vote the U S will keep its doors
open when we present our case to them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#44:1:A>
I believe that true friendship does not hinge on a piece of paper
but upon the recognition of mutual rights and obligations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#45:1:A>
This necessarily includes a shared concern for the environment and
for the sanctity of human life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#46:1:A>
Mr President I have great faith in the United States of America and
its people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#47:1:A>
Bound by a history of shared ideals and aspirations I am confident
that we can come to a mutual understanding and a resolution of our
differences
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#48:1:A>
I believe we can achieve national security with the United States
under an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#49:1:A>
We should have a partnership between equals not an alliance of
subservience
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#50:1:A>
We need a treaty of cooperation not a pact of subjugation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#51:1:A>
As a student of national security Mr President I realize how
fragile peace is and how ambition can transcend national borders to provoke
conflict
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#52:1:A>
But the V F A is not the solution to our external security problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#53:1:A>
The solution lies in diplomacy not in rattling sabers and
precipitating aggression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#54:1:A>
The era is past when national security and stability can simply be
defined as involving freedom from war or securing the national territory from
external aggression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#55:1:A>
National security and stability must now be based on the resolution
of basic social economic and political problems that breed poverty inequity
and injustice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#56:1:A>
Mr President the greatest battle we have to fight now is not
outside our shores but deep within us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#57:1:A>
Our greatest enemy is a defeatist view that has kept us hostage in
our own fears
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#58:1:A>
When will we overcome this culture of mendicancy that allows the
dumping of obsolete and expensive war materiel in our country simply because
we have lost the will to provide for ourselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#59:1:A>
The last eight years <.> di </.> disproved our fears
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#60:1:A>
We have seen that for as long as we have faith in the capacity and
resilience of our people we can be equal to the challenge of growth
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#61:1:A>
We have also proven that we can prosper better in freedom and
independence a proud nation that forges onward without the yoke of servility
and stand boldly for the rights and welfare of its citizens
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#62:1:A>
Mr President there is life after the bases just as we should
realize that the commonality of interests between the Philippines and the
United States did not cease with the removal of the military bases in
nineteen ninety-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#63:1:A>
In fact three years after the pull-out the U S remains to be our
major export market even as our own armed forces continues to purchase
armaments and receive training from America
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#64:1:A>
Mr President it is barely a year since our nation celebrated one
hundred years of freedom as a republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#65:1:A>
Shall we destroy that spirit and purpose of the Centennial by
beginning a new century a new millennium with a vote that would negate the
ideals of freedom and independence which we gained at the cost of the lives
of our valiant forebears
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#66:1:A>
History Mr President would be unforgiving
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#67:1:A>
<indig> Huwag po nating sayangin ang kasarinlan na pinagbuwisan ng
buhay ng ating mga magigiting na ninuno </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#68:1:A>
As the youngest senator in this august body I speak for the youth
as I cast my vote today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#69:1:A>
This vote is their vote Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#70:1:A>
We the youth vote for honor and self-respect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#71:1:A>
We vote to live in dignity and freedom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#72:1:A>
We vote to assert our right to a sovereign future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#73:1:A>
Therefore Mr President we vote <mention> no </mention> a million
times <mention> no </mention> to this Visiting Forces Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#74:1:A>
Today as we cast our vote let us take time to remember with pride
the heroic rejection by the Philippine Senate of the onerous U S Military
Bases Agreement in nineteen ninety-one and on this day let us relive that
glorious moment in our history as we proudly confirm our independence as a
nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#75:1:A>
Mr President our vote is <mention> no </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#76:1:A>
<indig> Maraming salamat po at mabuhay ang sambayanang Pilipino
 </indig> </I>

 <$A> <X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X77:2:A>
Mr President on several occasions in the past I have uh voted on
issues presented before the Senate guided only by the principle that I vote
freely and rationally according to my conscience and the public interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X78:2:A>
Last I voted years back for the re-imposition of the of the death
penalty and I voted for the rejection of the Uruguay round on the General
Agreement on Tariff and Trade
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X79:2:A>
I was with the majority in the former and I was with the minority
in the latter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X80:2:A>
Today I cast my vote on a matter of importance to our people
guided only by conscience reason and the public interest </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#81:2:A>
With the indulgence of my colleagues Mr President allow me to
explain my vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#82:2:A>
The issue at hand may be likened to the question of whether or not
we want a certain group to come and visit us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#83:2:A>
The door keeper is the Senate and the home owner of course is the
Filipino people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#84:2:A>
Whether the door keeper in the exercise of delegated authority from
the home owner opens or shuts the door proves only one thing that it has
power over the entry of the visitor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#85:2:A>
It is therefore wrong to say that to allow the visitor to come in
is a surrender of power
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#86:2:A>
And in case the visitor proves herself himself not a pleasant one
she can always be asked to leave as she did once leave in nineteen ninety-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#87:2:A>
<indig> Itong visitor na ito'y sumusunod </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#88:2:A>
But the big picture is that this is really a tale of two visits
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#89:2:A>
<X> <indig> 'Yung isa ay kumakatok at nagpapaalam pumasok
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X90:2:A>
'Yung isa naman nakapasok na sa ating bakuran nagtayo na ng
kanyang kabahayan at nag-aalok pang bumisita tayo sa kanilang itinayong
bahayan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X91:2:A>
Ang sabi pa nila kung gusto nating makibahagi sa anumang kayamanan
ng kalikasang matatagpuan doon ay maaari naman daw tayong bumisita
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X92:2:A>
Kung maari nga lang huwag daw nating papapasukin yung kumakatok na
kagalit nila </indig> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#93:2:A>
One visitor is knocking on our door while the other an intruder
actually had entered and built a shanty within our compound without knocking
at the door of the Senate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#94:2:A>
This shanty grew into a structure of strong materials worse that
intruder had claimed the lot as his own and says we must not allow the
visitor knocking on our door to enter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#95:2:A>
And I am disheartened that those who oppose the entry of the
visitor knocking at our door do not raise even a small squeak against the sly
incursion of the intruder
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#96:2:A>
Worse the Communist National Democratic Front finds an uncommon
ally in the leadership of the Catholic Church
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#97:2:A>
Are the people at our gates the National Democratic Front and the
Catholic Church exercising selective nationalism
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#98:2:A>
Why do they not demonstrate in front of the Chinese Embassy in the
Philippines against this intrusion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#99:2:A>
Why is the Catholic Church following the line of the National
Democratic Front
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#100:2:A>
Do their leaders not see anything wrong from the activities of the
Chinese in the Mischief Reef
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#101:2:A>
<X> They have even raised issues on would-be prostitution but I
wonder why they have never raised the issues or raised against prostitution
in Binondo Bocaue Culi-culi <unclear> 1 word </unclear> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#102:2:A>
Mr President the Visiting Forces Agreement is about giving
Filipino soldiers and civilians not only the requisite military training for
the defense of the country but also cooperation in relief and rescue
operations and environmental protection and other developmental programs in
times of peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#103:2:A>
Then the question arises
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#104:2:A>
Why should we train with the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#105:2:A>
<indig> E bakit diyan sa mga Kano </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#106:2:A>
The truth Mr President is obvious
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#107:2:A>
They have the equipment the latest technology and they are willing
to train us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#108:2:A>
Others may have the equipment but they belong to the other side of
the ideological spectrum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#109:2:A>
We don't expect to be trained by our enemies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#110:2:A>
Some young Filipinos say we must not enter into such an agreement
but I dare say that millions of our youth in the schools and at their homes
think otherwise
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#111:2:A>
For any miscalculation on our part will put their lives on the
line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#112:2:A>
In spite of the high tech nature of the wars of tomorrow the dying
still has to be suffered by the young soldiers of the Republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#113:2:A>
We cannot be sitting ducks of future invaders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#114:2:A>
We must defend ourselves
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#115:2:A>
If we do not train with new technology now we cannot play a
significant role in our country 's defense
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#116:2:A>
The art of warfare has changed from David 's sling shot to the
laser-guided intelligent bombs that can hit targets as small as a golf ball
anywhere in the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#117:2:A>
In spite of our intense nationalism and pride as a people we must
wake up to the reality of our lack of adequate military equipment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#118:2:A>
The Filipino people in my humble perception Mr President are
predominantly in favor of a military alliance with the United States for the
simple reason that in spite of our differences we are not prepared to defend
ourselves in case of external aggression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#119:2:A>
And I always worry about external aggression especially about this
intruder visitor every time I read the book of Revelations chapters sixteen
to twenty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#120:2:A>
Mr President let us look to the future with hope rather than look
back in fear of what have gone wrong with our relations with the United
States
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#121:2:A>
The Filipino veterans are for V F A because they have seen the
high cost of human lives and property for unpreparedness during the second
World War when we lost one million lives and lived through hell for three
years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#122:2:A>
The Filipino soldiers are for V F A because as we debate here in
the Senate they are out there in the hills and mountains fighting and dying
for us against Communist groups who are at times better equipped and trained
than our very own warriors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#123:2:A>
The silent but no less patriotic Filipino youth are for V F A as
they go about their daily task of studying in our schools for their own
future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#124:2:A>
The ruling class of the Catholic Church in the Philippines the
Catholic Bishops Conference in the Philippines is against V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#125:2:A>
But the Catholic <indig> masa </indig> the <foreign> El Shaddai
 </foreign> whose economic class mirrors that of our Filipino soldiers are in
favor of V F A
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#126:2:A>
The ordinary Filipino soldier wishes to ally with the forces of
democracy in this part of the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#127:2:A>
Mr President we can choose to be romantic and claim we need no
training or joint exercises with the Americans
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#128:2:A>
<X> <indig> E kanino tayo makikipag-training
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X129:2:A>
Ano huwag na lang tayong mag-training para e talagang para tayong
nakatihaya sa kalaban
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X130:2:A>
E nagbago na ho ang mundo Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X131:2:A>
Pati China nga nagbago na rin ng pananaw e
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X132:2:A>
Yun po yung McDonalds eh gusting-gusto na ho sa Bejing ang lakas
ng benta
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X133:2:A>
Ang communist Vietnam ay umaakit na ng foreign investment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X134:2:A>
Samantalang tayo nakakulong pa sa lumang kaisipan ng Komunismo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#X135:2:A>
Yung mga debateng ginagamit na narinig natin sabi nga ni Senator
John Osme&ntilde;a ay dadagdagan ko mga lumang tugtugin na kumita na Mr
President </indig> </X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#136:2:A>
To be anti-American does not necessarily mean being pro-Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#137:2:A>
I choose to be pro-Filipino even it if it means training for the
defense of this country with an American
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#138:2:A>
The late Communist leader Deng Zhao Ping said I don't care the
color of the cat for as long as it catches mice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#139:2:A>
For me I do not care with whom we train for as long as we defend
our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-032#140:2:A>
Mr President I cast the sixteenth affirmative vote for the V F A
 </I>
