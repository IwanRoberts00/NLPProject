<h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#4:1>
<it> Health social science is a new field of study that seeks to
provide an alternative perspective to established models and analyses that
the health/medical and social sciences have separately used in examining
health social problems and issues today.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#5:1>
Not wanting to reinvent the wheel, health social science advocates a
transdisciplinary approach in the conceptualization, collection and analysis
of knowledge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#6:1>
Participatory research, a methodology that emphasizes process, is
seen to complement the interactive nature of health social science.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#7:1>
This paper presents the empowering characteristic participatory
research can provide in understanding the socio-cultural dimension of
reproductive tract infections ( RTIs) and in breaking through the silence
women in particular have suffered in their experiences of RTIs. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#8:1>
The impact of medicine and health care on the lives of people
today has assumed immeasurable magnitude and value.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#9:1>
At the same time, people face mercurial changes in their communities
and societies that have implications on their health and general well-being.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#10:1>
This increasing reality has challenged medical and social scientists
to respond to changes and forces that threaten the individuals ' capacity to
realize their potential in various roles and activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#11:1>
Medical and social scientists, given their ethnocentric disciplines,
have long ignored the fact that health is social and, therefore, necessitates
interdisciplinary cooperation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#12:1>
However, with the unabated and acute human health conditions that
exist across societies, medical and social scientists have been compelled to
cross their disciplinal boundaries, thus resulting in health social science.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#13:1>
Health social science, therefore, was conceived to enhance solutions
for the kind of health problems that emerged at this turn of the century.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#14:1>
As a new body of knowledge, health social science is in flux.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#15:1>
Initiatives have begun with collaborations among different
disciplines and sectors in a specific activity - - say research - - to
develop a common framework; redefine and build on concepts; sharpen existing
tools and experiment with methods, and analyze the <quote> &ldquo; problem
from all systems level at the same time &rdquo; </quote> ( Ratcliff, 1989).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#16:1>
From this, a different and new integrative approach, described as
transdisciplinary, is produced.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#17:1>
However, the accumulation of knowledge and experience necessary to
support this new field of inquiry is still inadequate ( Rosenfield, 1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#18:1>
What I hope to do in this paper is to illuminate ongoing efforts
toward this transdisciplinary approach, particularly in health social science
research.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#19:1>
To do this, I will utilize the field activities I have conducted
during the past months to illustrate how a social science methodology such as
participatory research ( PR) can inadvertently create conditions through
which opportunities for interventions to improve women 's health can be
initiated. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#20:1>
<h> <bold> Participatory Research in Health </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#21:1>
Participatory research ( PR), also referred to as participatory
action research ( PAR), was initially developed in countries at Latin
America, Africa, and Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#22:1>
The impetus for this approach was the concern with persistent
inequalities in the distribution of power and resources, and the processes
which help to keep in place dependency and domination in the relationships
between privileged dominant and marginalized groups of people ( de Koning and
Martin, 1996).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#23:1>
There was an increasing awareness that the feeling of helplessness
about one 's conditions must first be confronted to fight oppression and
alleviate poverty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#24:1>
In the development of health programmes, Budd Hall was one of the
first writers to emphasize PR 's importance.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#25:1>
The emphasis on community participation in primary health care ( PHC)
has encouraged health professionals to look at the implications and relations
between a community 's involvement in PHC and research.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#26:1>
Many of the initial applications centered around the involvement of
communities and health professionals in needs assessment, planning and
evaluation of programmes ( Feuertein 1988, MacDonald 1986, Nichter 1984 in de
Koning and Martin, 1996).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#27:1>
Since then, other influences have contributed to the further
development of participatory research.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#28:1>
Moreover, primary health care has become more familiar in a diversity
of disciplines and settings such as rural development and agriculture,
community development, health and education. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#29:1>
Participatory research has been interpreted in different ways.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#30:1>
These range from the collaboration between the researcher and
research community designing the research, researcher designing the study and
the members of the community involved in data collection, to the community
that works closely with a non-governmental organization ( NGO).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#31:1>
While what the activity is and who in the community will be involved
in which activity are important in PR ( e.g., objective setting, design,
collection, analysis), it is just as important to determine the how, or the
process of their involvement.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#32:1>
PR emphasizes the process of knowledge production because:

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#33:1>
1. it helps the marginalized and deprived people to gain
self-confidence and pride in being able to provide a useful contribution to
community life;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#34:1>
2. it builds respect and empathy among professional groups for the
insights and knowledge people have and the problems they face; and

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#35:1>
3. it also facilitates the development of programmes that take into
account the specific situations and conditions which will influence the
outcome/s of the programmes ( Chamber, 1983).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#36:1>
Listening to local people helps avoid mistakes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#37:1>
In brief, participatory research advocates the integration of the
traditionally isolated practices of research, education and action through
which dominant knowledge, structures and processes are challenged and, as a
result, empower underserved people to transform their existing social
realities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#38:1>
As an alternative research practice, participatory research poses
important implications to a person meeting the essential prerequisites of
life and living, one of which is health.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#39:1>
Given the above framework of PR, the human being is seen as an active
agent in pursuit of her or his own health ( de Koning and Martin, 1996).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#40:1>
This means recognizing the person 's and community 's right to know
about such things as health status, the causes of ill-health, treatment and
prevention, and resources available to improve health.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#41:1>
Health issues and needs have become far more complex than they were
before.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#42:1>
Hence, people and communities need to acquire the capacity to
understand issues related to their health.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#43:1>
Feminist researchers, for example, enable groups of women to pose
problems and question standard definitions, explanations, decisions about
their own experiences. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#44:1>
This research is an initial attempt to provide an avenue for a
sector whose voices have long been ignored in understanding and managing a
health problem that women have been socialized to be silent about. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#45:1>
<h> <bold> Participatory Health Research through Women Talk </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#46:1>
For the past eight months, I have been talking with urban poor
women from <foreign> Sitio </foreign> Rizal, in Alabang, Muntinlupa, about
reproductive tract infections ( RTI) specifically, and their reproductive
health in general.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#47:1>
To paraphrase a standard definition, reproductive health is the
ability of women to <quote> &ldquo; regulate their own fertility safely and
effectively by conceiving when desired, by terminating unwanted pregnancies,
and by carrying wanted pregnancies to term; remain free of disease,
disability, fear, pain, or death associated with reproduction and sexuality;
bear and raise healthy children &rdquo; </quote> ( Germain, 1987).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#48:1>
Women in the Philippines, particularly those who are poor, face a
number of reproductive health problems such as RTI complications in
pregnancies, fetal wastage, sexual violence, and maternal nutrition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#49:1>
RTIs in the Philippines, as in many developing countries, are
extremely common and their consequences on the health of women are serious
and may even be fatal.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#50:1>
This situation is reinforced by a culture of silence surrounding RTIs
in view of the misconception that women are responsible for RTIs, especially
sexually transmitted diseases or STDs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#51:1>
As observed by one researcher, <O> quotation </O> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#52:1>
Compounded by limited health services, women live with the
symptoms, pain, and morbidity that result from RTIs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#53:1>
It is in this context that I have been talking with women, both
married and single, and listening to their experiences, problems and
concerns.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#54:1>
Through a focus group discussion, which is not designed to be an
exchange involving a selected group of women and myself, I engaged the women
in what Dale Spender ( 1980) described as <mention> woman-to-woman talk
</mention> systematized, with the women as the speaking subjects.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#55:1>
In <mention> &ldquo; women talk, &rdquo; </mention> the value of
communication among the women themselves is most important.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#56:1>
It affords opportunities for women to speak more fully about their
experiences, especially if they perceive no barriers such as class and gender
differences in speaking.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#57:1>
Aware that I was most different from them, and that there was a
possibility that this might inhibit them, I saw to it that the approach to
the subject matter would allow them to feel comfortable enough to speak from
their everyday experience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#58:1>
Our research, in medical language, is about reproductive
morbidity, specifically the socio-cultural dimensions in the occurrence,
transmission and treatment of reproductive tract infections primarily among
women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#59:1>
Employing a multi-method approach, consisting of a sample survey,
focus group discussion or FGD, clinical assessment, and key informant
interviews, the research demonstrated that the FGD was the most helpful
method in understanding the social processes that a medical diagnosis does
not examine.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#60:1>
One of my initial difficulties, however, was that the term <mention>
&ldquo; reproductive health &rdquo; </mention> cannot be easily and
accurately translated into Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#61:1>
Because it would have been awkward for me to begin by immediately
asking about private matters like fertility regulation, sexual activities,
illness experienced related to their reproductive function, and other similar
concerns, I began with a question I first preferred not to ask for fear that
it would elicit varied answers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#62:1>
But I asked it anyway - - <indig> <quote> Kumusta na ang inyong
kalusugan? </quote> </indig> <&> trans., and how is your health? </&>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#63:1>
Without further specific questions, I received answers that were
related to what the study is all about.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#64:1>
It was so natural for the women to talk about their common
gynaecological concerns, foremost of which were unusually prolonged
menstruation or an irregular period ( for example, having a period twice a
month and then not having one for three months) and other symptoms of
menopause for most of the married women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#65:1>
Many acknowledged experiencing not mere discomforts but other
physical conditions such as black-out, severe dizziness, back aches, and
abdominal pains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#66:1>
However, it was also common for the women not to seek treatment for
these illnesses even if they perceive they may have gynaecological problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#67:1>
This was seen in their experience when having the abnormal vaginal
discharges and severe abdominal pain that accompany RTIs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#68:1>
For them, RTIs are an inevitable part of being a woman and these are
to be endured.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#69:1>
For nine ( 9) out of 10 married respondents, such conditions did not
require help.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#70:1>
The one respondent who differed explained that she decided to have a
check-up only once in the past because she was having two menstrual periods a
month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#71:1>
Prior to the check-up she, just like many of the other women, had
been regulating her fertility by drinking a herbal medicine, known as
<mention> &ldquo; <indig> makabuhay </indig> , &rdquo; </mention> concocted
by boiling the roots and mixing a bottle of Chinese whiskey or &ldquo;
<indig> siyoktong </indig> . &rdquo; She narrated: <O> quotation in Tagalog
</O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#72:1>
Her story generated questions and varied experiences among the
women regarding the use of herbal medicines sold with intention of remedying
reproductive health problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#73:1>
In the course of the talk, when I felt the women were somehow waiting
to hear another story that would confirm the consequences of using herbal
medicines, the same respondent reiterated what she was told at the
Philippines General Hospital: <O> quotation in Tagalog </O> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#74:1>
The discussion then turned to <mention> pap smear </mention> , a
procedure they know is important but rarely consult their doctor about.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#75:1>
Since pap smear, while valuable, serves only as a screening test, the
occurrence of infection is hard to determine if also based on medical
treatment sought by women for gynaecological problems like infections since
in most cases they do not seek help for these conditions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#76:1>
I asked why medical help is not sought and the simple response was
that it may bring into question the sexual behavior of both husband and wife.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#77:1>
Furthermore, if infected, the women know they will be advised not to
engage in sexual relations with their husbands, which may in turn lead to
tension and even violence in the marital relationships.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#78:1>
As we talked about other related matters such as their use of family
planning methods and domestic issues like violence against women, I came to
understand more about how the community mediates women 's attitudes and
actions toward reproductive health problems, particularly in the case of
RTIs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#79:1>
It is in this context that I see how social scientists, through their
skill of eliciting accounts that reveal the consciousness that has shaped the
thoughts and perspectives of their respondents, can play a more distinctive
role in health and medicine. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#80:1>
<h> <bold> Consciousness-Raising in Women Talk </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#81:1>
The 1980s witnessed an intellectual explosion of research efforts
linking the medical and social sciences ( Good, 1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#82:1>
This initiative was made possible after the significant Alma Ata
conference of 1978, sponsored by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#83:1>
The Alma Ata meeting formulated the goal of <mention> Health for All
by the Year 2000 </mention> , a goal to be achieved not by building
hospitals, but by promoting community-based primary health care, community
participation, and intersectoral actions for health ( WHO, 1978).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#84:1>
Collaborative efforts between social science and medicine have been
undertaken since then in several areas: cultural and behavioral aspects of
specific diseases ranging from malaria to leprosy and diarrhea; social
pathologies such as suicide and drug addiction; broad programmatic themes
such as nutrition, family planning, child survival, and health services,
including health care financing; and policy issues, from health-specific
service policies to intersectoral activities for health improvements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#85:1>
Stronger support for interdisciplinary research was given
international recognition following the publication in 1990 of the report of
the International Independent Commission on Health Research for Development (
Commission on Health Research for Development, 1990).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#86:1>
Its major recommendation is to promote <mention> &ldquo; Essential
National Health Research &rdquo; </mention> ( or ENHR) in each country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-013#87:1>
The ENHR aims to tie together research, policy, and action through
the creative collaboration of social and medical scientists. </p> </I>
