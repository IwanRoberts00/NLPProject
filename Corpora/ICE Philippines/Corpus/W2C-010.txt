<h> <bold> Foreign debt piles up as RP rebuilds economy </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#3:1>
Finally, experts see the Philippines heading towards recovery
after more than a year of suffering from the effects of the Asian financial
crisis, but Filipinos will find rebuilding the economy can be very expensive.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#4:1>
Latest official government figures show future generations of
taxpayers will have to contend with paying for additional foreign loans.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#5:1>
Next year, &dollar;8.39 billion will be borrowed by the government and
the private sector to make the recovery process as short as possible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#6:1>
<indig> Bangko Sentral </indig> figures show this will bring the
country 's outstanding external debt - - both public and private - - to
&dollar;53.2 billion, from &dollar;44.81 billion before the start of the
currency turmoil in July last year, or an 18.72% expansion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#7:1>
Additional loans have been negotiated since early this year
between the government and such multilateral financing institutions as the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the
Japan Export Import Bank and the Japanese government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#8:1>
These loans - - to be released in several <foreign> tranches
</foreign> in the next two years - - will help the Estrada administration
heal the economy by financing much-needed reforms, the government says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#9:1>
The World Bank loan, for example, was designed to finance reforms
in the banking sector especially in the area of bank supervision and
examination, where most of the attention since the onset of the crisis has
been focused on. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#10:1>
The ADB gave priority to reforms in the social sector and has
extended two loans in the air and energy sectors, stressing that the Asian
financial crisis has developed into a human crisis of great proportions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#11:1>
The IMF, through a standby facility activated by the government
early this year, will provide the balance-of-payments support the <indig>
Bangko Sentral </indig> needs both to ensure the country 's credit worthiness
and as protection against currency speculators. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#12:1>
The government also said it is hoping to acquire &dollar;250
million in financial assistance from the Japanese government through the
<mention> Miyazawa Initiative </mention> , a facility for Asian countries
pledged during the IMF-World Bank annual meeting a few months ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#13:1>
The IMF, the country 's tutor for two more years, the government
says, has allowed the government to bear the burden of revitalizing the
economy - - more borrowings and budget deficits - - to keep the economy
alive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#14:1>
Loans from the private sector are expected to be few since
business confidence has yet to resume. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#15:1>
Warnings have been aired that the government should decide
carefully which loans to incur so as not to make the Philippines vulnerable
to another debt overhang at the end of the recovery period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#16:1>
It was pointed out that loans, even from cheaper sources like the
World Bank, the ADB and the IMF are still loans that have to be paid within a
few years down the road. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#17:1>
Former National Economic and Development Authority ( NEDA) deputy
director-general Dante B. Canlas said earlier that if deficits must be
incurred and foreign financing tapped, the government should carefully study
which ones will be accepted, and how much.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#18:1>
He urged the government to keep its budget deficit as temporary as
possible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#19:1>
At &dollar;53.2 billion, the country 's outstanding external debt
will be 66.8% of its gross national product, 94.5% of receipts from exports
of goods and services, official figures show. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#20:1>
For 1999 alone, the Philippines will have to cough up &dollar;5.9
billion for debt service on these obligations, preliminary figures from the
<indig> Bangko Sentral </indig> show.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#21:1>
Interest payments alone will reach &dollar;3 billion. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Congress panels start 1999 budget deliberations; 'pork'
still an issue </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#23:2>
<bold> Yasmin Lee G. Arpon </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#24:2>
The Senate and House of Representatives panels are set to meet
tomorrow to begin bicameral discussions on the National Government 's 1999
budget.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#25:2>
Congress is hard-pressed to ratify next year 's budget before going
on its month-long Christmas break starting Dec. 23. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#26:2>
A contentious issue that may stall the discussions is the
divergent views of senators and congressmen on Congress ' role in the budget
process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#27:2>
The Senate panel members are Senators John Osme&ntilde;a,
Franklin Drilon, Juan Ponce Enrile and Teofisto Guingona. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#28:2>
The House, on the other hand, is still yet to appoint its panel
today, but three are already certain to be a part of the panel: House
committee on appropriations chairman Gilberto Duavit of Rizal, committee
senior vice-chairman Leandro Verceles, Jr. of Catanduanes and House Minority
Leader Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. of Quezon City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#29:2>
The Senate approved a &peso;585-billion 1999 budget, including
unprogrammed funds and debt service.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#30:2>
The amount is &peso;3 billion less than what was earlier approved by
the House. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#31:2>
The House generally favors the increase made by the Senate on the
various departments ' budgets such as the Department of Public Works and
Highways ' which was increased to &peso;41.5 billion from &peso;37.8 billion.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#32:2>
But congressmen are not too happy with the removal by senators of
a provision that would give them the leeway to identify projects in their
respective districts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#33:2>
Mr. Osme&ntilde;a, chairman of the Senate committee on finance,
earlier said Congress ' participation in the budget process stops with the
approval of the General Appropriations Act ( GAA). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#34:2>
But congressmen want to assert their oversight function since
this is the only way they can claim participation in the budget process,
especially after President Estrada scrapped the countrywide development funds
and public works funds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#35:2>
Under House Bill No. 4240, congressional consultation and
approval are required in the implementation of projects, facilities, programs
and services under the GAA. </p>

&ldquo; The President has already agreed to that as a way of
accommodating the congressmen.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#37:2>
Maybe that is only public posturing ( on the Senate 's part), &rdquo;
</quote> Batanes Rep. Florencio Abad, vice-chairman of the appropriations
body, said in an interview yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#38:2>
He noted that, for one, it has been the practice for congressmen
to coordinate with the DPWH in identifying district projects and that <quote>
&ldquo; DPWH does not seem to mind this. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#39:2>
Mr. Abad also described the differences between the Senate and
the House as an <quote> &ldquo; institutional competition that only exists
before the public eye. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#40:2>
Leyte Rep. Sergio Apostol, House senior deputy minority leader,
concurred saying the senators are likely to agree to retain the contentious
provision.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#41:2>
<quote> <indig> &ldquo; Kuwento lang 'yan, &rdquo; </indig> <&> (
trans., that's only a story) </&> </quote> Mr. Apostol said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#42:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Tell me, who will identify the projects?

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#43:2>
The Congressmen are the ones conversant as to what are needed by
their respective districts. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#44:2>
Congressmen are confident of eventually convincing Mr.
Osme&ntilde;a to give them leeway to identify projects <quote> &ldquo; since
he is a former congressman himself. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#45:2>
Meanwhile, the House did not pose any initial opposition to the
Senate 's proposal to cut the debt service by &peso;4 billion or to
&peso;116.7 billion from &peso;120.7 billion.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#46:2>
The House did not touch the debt service allocation although it has
been Congress ' common practice to cut this and realign the funds to the
legislators ' pet projects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#47:2>
In previous years, the President would veto the cuts but not the
realignments made, bloating the national budget. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#48:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The chairman ( Mr. Duavit) and even the President
has been quite emphatic not to return to that old practice so to the extent
possible, we have avoided that, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Abad said. </p>

<p> <quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#49:2>
&ldquo; But there is already a leeway because of the reduction in the
interest rates.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#50:2>
Because of the lack of funds, the tendency is really to look for it
in areas where cuts could be made and given the change in the economic
conditions, we agree to that, &rdquo; </quote> he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#51:2>
The Senate decided to cut the debt service, noting that the
interest rate has since gone down to 13.5% from Malaca&ntilde;ang 's
assumption of 16.5%.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#52:2>
Also, the foreign exchange rate assumption was cut to &peso;40 from
&peso;43: &dollar;1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#53:2>
But Mr. Abad noted that cutting the debt service will violate the
Constitution since debt service is considered an automatic appropriations and
is already provided by law. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#89:4>
The Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR) asked yesterday the Supreme
Court to uphold the confiscation of 30 parcels of land owned by the heirs of
former President Ferdinand Marcos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#90:4>
The land parcels were taken as partial payment for &peso;23.5
billion in unpaid estate and income taxes for the year 1982 to 1986. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#91:4>
In an 18-page comment, the BIR asked the Court to junk the
Marcoses ' second appeal of the confiscation, saying it is already <quote>
&ldquo; obstructive of the orderly administration of justice. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#92:4>
BIR also said the second appeal did not present any <quote>
&ldquo; persuasive reason &rdquo; </quote> to overturn the Court 's earlier
ruling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#93:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Considering the obvious lack of merit...it is but
proper for the Court to now write <foreign> finis </foreign> to this case. ...
&ldquo; </quote> it added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#94:4>
In June 1997, the Court approved the sale of the land parcels to
satisfy the family 's tax debt. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#95:4>
It affirmed the Court of Appeals ' ruling upholding the validity
of 30 notices of levy against the properties.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#96:4>
It said the government may seize the assets as a summary tax remedy
without the approval of a settlement court. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#97:4>
The ruling has twice been appealed by the President 's son,
Ferdinand &ldquo; Bongbong &rdquo; Marcos II, who sought the nullification of
the notices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#98:4>
In 1991, BIR ruled the Marcoses failed to pay a total of
&peso;23.2 billion covering deficiency estate taxes for four years and
deficiency income taxes for 1982 to 1986. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#99:4>
BIR said it was constrained to go after the properties because
the Marcoses <quote> &ldquo; deliberately ignored &rdquo; </quote> the
deficiency tax assessment personally served on Mr. Marcos and his mother,
Imelda. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#100:4>
BIR issued 30 notices of levy on real property owned by the
Marcoses, most of which are in Leyte, to satisfy the tax debt.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-010#101:4>
The land parcels were forfeited in favor of the government. </p>
