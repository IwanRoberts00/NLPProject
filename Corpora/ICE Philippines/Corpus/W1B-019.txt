<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#8:1>
Dear Mr. Halliday,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#9:1>
1. This is in reply to your letter dated 1 September 1997
regarding the Resident Abroad Program ( RAP) membership fee for our newly
established Resident Mission in Almaty, Kazakstan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#10:1>
2. Although we understand your reasons for using individual plan
rather than the corporate group rates for the membership fee, we believe we
should apply the corporate group rates for the following reasons:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#11:1>
i. Our contract, which was just renewed this year, is for a two year
period which will end on 15 June 1999.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#12:1>
In accordance with the contract, the RAP rates are ( a) &dollar;132
per individual, and ( b) &dollar;264 per family.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#13:1>
ii. We noted that the rate for individual membership is very much
higher than the present corporate group rate.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#14:1>
iii. The number of staff members assigned in the Resident Mission is
not relevant to the issue.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#15:1>
Please note that in our Cambodia and Vietnam Resident Missions we
have only one staff each, and we also applied the corporate group rates to
them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#16:1>
3. Thank you and we trust that you understand and agree with our
position on this matter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#17:1>
4. Best regards. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#18:1>
Sincerely,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#19:1>

Subject: In-House Pharmacy - Payment for the Cost of the Medicines

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#28:2>
1. Agreement has been reached between BPCB and Philippine
Healthcare Information & Services, Inc., Contractor for the In-House Pharmacy
on the amount and manner of payment of the medicines turned-over by the
Medical Services Units to the Pharmacy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#29:2>
The total cost of the medicines is &peso;1,799,572.44, which will be
paid over twelve equal monthly installments of &peso;149,964.37 each to
commence on 1 April 1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#30:2>
2. We are planning to have the payment credited to the Health
Services Budget, under account no. 822-9201-129-26.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#31:2>
We intend to use such payment to offset the cost of any enhancements
to the health care services provided to staff, such as vaccination programs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#32:2>
We would appreciate it if you could give us your concurrence to the
proposed method of accounting for and utilizing the payment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#33:2>
Thank you. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#36:3>
Subject: 1998 Supporting Staff Pay Increase Distribution

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#37:3>
1. We have just completed the distribution of the 1998 pay
increases for supporting staff.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#38:3>
The Advice of Personnel Action ( APAs) will be sent to all
department/office heads by 7 May. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#39:3>
2. As stated in my 16 April 1998 memo to you, the pay increases
are based on a 15.9 percent increase in the salary structure, which is
reflective of the movement in the market.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#40:3>
Thus, the Bank 's salary structure for supporting staff has moved by
15.9 percent, <foreign> i.e. </foreign> , minimum, midpoint and maximum
salaries for levels 1 to 9A have all been raised by 15.9 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#41:3>
3. Guidelines for the distribution of the pay increases were sent
to the department/office heads and managers, and four briefing sessions were
held by BPCB and BPHR to explain the process.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#42:3>
The guidelines were developed to assist managers and
department/office heads determine individual pay increases for their staff
within their budgets.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#43:3>
The budgets were determined based on an assumed Bank-wide
distribution of staff falling in the &ldquo; fully meets or exceeds
requirements &rdquo; performance category.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#44:3>
As shown in the Salary Increase Matrix on the overleaf of my 16 April
1998 memo, this performance category was further divided into three
sub-categories with salary increase ranges varying by salary quartile, and
with the range increases overlapping between sub-categories. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#45:3>
4. The assumed distribution of staff was 65/25/10, <foreign> i.
e. </foreign> , 65 percent of staff would be in the first sub-category
reflecting average performance, 25 percent would fall in the second
sub-category pertaining to above average performance, while 10 percent would
be in the third sub-category consisting of the outstanding staff.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#46:3>
However, as explained during the briefing sessions, this distribution
was not rigid, and managers and department/office heads had full flexibility
in allocating increases for as long as they kept within their budgets.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#47:3>
Indeed, the final results of the pay distribution show that 51
percent of staff were placed in the first sub-category, 38 percent were in
the second sub-category, and 11 percent were in the third sub-category.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#48:3>
( This distribution is based on the use of the midpoints of the
overlaps as the delineating points between sub-categories.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#49:3>
5. In the briefing sessions, it was also stressed that the
sub-categories were to be used only to determine individual pay increases so
as to ensure Bank-wide consistency in the allocation of increases to staff
with similar performance rating and salary quartile.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#50:3>
There would be no labeling and recording of the sub-categories of
staff in their personnel files.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#51:3>
In fact, the overlaps in the salary matrix were introduced to ensure
that staff would not be categorized. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#52:3>
6. For your information, below is a graph showing the Bank-wide
distribution of pay increases.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#53:3>
Please note that majority of supporting staff or 61 percent received
increases ranging from 17 to 20 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#54:3>
7. Since this is the first year of the new Performance Management
System and the pay increase distribution using range increases for supporting
staff, we will be seeking the comments of the managers and the Staff Council
on the new system, particularly its technical aspects, for possible
implementation in the future. </p> </I>

Subject : <bold> Dependents Life and Disability Insurance Plan (
DLDIP) Increase in Coverage of Spouse </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#59:4>
1. Under the Dependents Life and Disability Insurance Plan (
DLDIP), staff covered under the Group Life Insurance Plan ( GLIP) may insure
their spouse up to the staff member 's GLIP coverage, with the coverage
expressed in units of PHP 5,000.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#60:4>
Since the GLIP coverage is related to staff salaries, opportunities
are given periodically for staff to increase the DLDIP coverage of their
spouses, in proportion to increases in staff salaries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#61:4>
2. The last time staff were given the opportunity to increase
their spouses ' coverage was in October 1997, and the increase was based on
the salary increases received between January 1996 and September 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#62:4>
You may now wish to increase your spouse 's coverage based on the
salary increases you have received since October 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#63:4>
3. To determine the maximum DLDIP coverage applicable to your
spouse, the total percentage increase in your salary between 1 October 1997
and 31 July 1999 will be applied to the current number of units of your
spouse 's coverage, with the product rounded down to the whole number of
units.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#64:4>
Your spouse 's current coverage, the maximum coverage, as well as the
corresponding monthly premiums will be shown in the Staff Benefits
Information System <ul> from 9 to 23 August 1999 </ul> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#65:4>
To access this information in the SBIS, please do the following:

after you report back to work.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#75:4>
Your spouse 's increased coverage will be effective <ul> 1 September
1999 </ul> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#76:4>
5. If ( i) we receive your Request Form after the applicable
deadline, and/or ( ii) you wish to increase your spouse 's coverage up to an
amount which is higher than the maximum coverage shown in the SBIS, but lower
than or equal to your own GLIP coverage; please submit a Proof of Health form
to the Compensation and Benefits Division, for transmittal to the insurer.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#77:4>
If the insurer approves the Proof of Health form, then the effective
date of your spouse 's coverage will be the date of approval by the insurer.

Subject : Renewal of Emergency Assistance Contract with AEA
International Assistance Services ( Philippines) Inc.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#84:5>
1. The contract with AEA expired on 15 June 1997.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#85:5>
However, we were held covered pending resolution of the membership
fees applicable for the renewal year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#86:5>
2. In their letter dated 2 June 1997 ( Annex 1), AEA had proposed
membership fee increases averaging 8.44 percent, plus imposition of 10
percent VAT.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#87:5>
AEA confirmed that the Bank 's experience has been good but justified
the increase by citing escalation in administrative costs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#88:5>
We countered by asking them to propose a two year contract with fixed
membership fees.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#89:5>
A two year contract would provide stability in costs as well as
reduce administrative work.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#90:5>
We also objected to the 10 percent VAT, and advised them to issue the
policy out of Hong Kong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#91:5>
3. AEA has now submitted a revised proposal dated 17 June 1997
with membership fee increases averaging 5.69 percent ( Annex 2).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#92:5>
This percentage growth translates to an increase of around
&dollar;1,700 in the membership fee for 1997/1998 bringing the membership
fees to &dollar;31,356. 16.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#93:5>
( Please see Annex 3.)

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#94:5>
AEA has also agreed to issue the policy out of Hong Kong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#95:5>
4. We therefore recommend the renewal of the contract with AEA
for two years ending 15 June 1999 at the membership fees stated in AEA 's
letter dated 17 June 1997. </p> </I>

Subject: Emergency Assistance Proposals

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#100:5>
Further to the presentations made by International S. O. S.
Assistance and Asia Emergency Assistance last 29 May 1996, attached are the
proposed contract with SOS and the existing contracts with AEA.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#101:5>
The contracts with AEA expired on 15 May 1996, but they are holding
us covered until such time that we decide to renew or terminate the contracts
with them.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#102:5>
There are two contracts with AEA: the Corporate Traveller Programme
( CTP) which covers all Headquarters staff, support staff in the
Resident/Regional Missions, and their dependents; and the Resident Abroad
Programme which covers all professional staff in the Resident/Regional
Missions and their dependents.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#103:5>
The CTP covers the members only while they 're travelling outside
the city of the duty station, while the RAP covers the members while they 're
residing in or travelling outside the city of the duty station.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#104:5>
For AEA, also attached is the material on the Proposed Procedures
for Outpatient and Hospital Guarantees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#105:5>
Also attached is a comparison of the Geographical Limits,
Coverages, Membership Fees, Case Fees, and Alarm Centers for the two
companies.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#106:5>
Please note the following:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#107:5>
1. Geographical Limits: AEA provides broader coverage since they
cover all travels outside the city of the duty station, whereas SOS cover
only travels outside a radius of 100 miles from the duty station or outside
the Member 's country of residence.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#108:5>
2. Coverage: The coverages are broadly the same, although SOS has a
maximum limit for the cost of the medical evacuation and repatriation while
AEA has no limit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#109:5>
However, SOS provides additional non-medical services, although
these are not really essential services.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#110:5>
The exclusions are also similar.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#111:5>
3. Membership Fees: AEA charges higher fees with their annual fee
being more than double than that quoted by SOS.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-019#112:5>
4. Case Fees: AEA charges case fees for guaranteeing medical
expenses which are not related to medical evacuations whereas SOS does not.
