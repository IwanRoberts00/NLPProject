<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#3:1>
FOR CESAR Villalon Jr., the die is cast.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#4:1>
He is gearing up for a venture he has wanted to do for some time: run
an art gallery devoted entirely to prints or the graphic arts, drawings,
collages and photographs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#5:1>
He has found the space on the ground floor of Metrostar Building, 1007
Metropolitan Ave., at the east end of Ayala Avenue, Makati, and he intends to
name it <mention> The Drawing Room </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#6:1>
It 'll open later this month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#7:1>
What could be more sensible in a time of diminishing expectations,
with an East Asian currency crisis following decades of tiger economies in
the region, than to shift attention from painting - - the premier art form of
choice for most collectors - - to works just as original, esthetically valid,
a lot less expensive, and eminently collectible? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#8:1>
When paintings by young talents of the likes of Alfredo Esquillo (
Hiraya), Enrique Tabuena ( Art Matters) and Emmanuel Garibay (
Liongoren/Boston) now command on the average from &peso;30,000 to
&peso;60,000, while those in midcareer fetch upward of that range, one has
cause to pause before pulling out that checkbook. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#9:1>
With the market for paintings badly hit in these belt-tightening
times, Villalon 's entrepreneurial sense is turning to drawings and prints -
- given that there are still those out there with separable cash for whom art
is a viable psychic need.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#10:1>
Not only are they satisfying to collect for what they reveal of an
artist 's skill and sense of form, but their appeal to the budget-conscious,
not to mention the investment-wise looking for quality with a price tag a
fraction of the cost of a painting, are also obvious. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#11:1>
Factors determining precise cost would, of course, depend on an
artist 's talent and stature.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#12:1>
If it has intrinsic merit, its value appreciates as much as any work
in a painting medium by the same artist, assuming that his or her importance
is eventually confirmed over time.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#13:1>
So long as drawings or prints are perceived for their distinctive
hallmarks, they are neither less than nor inferior to paintings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#14:1>
Lovers of prints tend to be also lovers of drawings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#15:1>
The backbone of printmaking, or much of it, is draftsmanship, as
exemplified by such notable living graphic artists - - many of whom happen to
be painters as well - - as Arturo Luz, Rod. Paras-Perez, Mario Parial and
Neil Doloricon ( woodcuts, rubbercuts), J. Elizalde Navarro, Juvenal Sanso,
BenCab, Imelda Cajipe-Endaya, Virgilio Aviado, Brenda Fajardo and Fil
Delacruz ( etchings, lithographs).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#16:1>
They partially represent a source of printmaking that calls for
greater advocacy from galleries through well informed dealership in entire
editions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#17:1>
<h> <bold> Mad about prints </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#18:1>
Drawings and prints may not have the kind of visual impact as
paintings do at first contact.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#19:1>
But their quieter, more intimate appeal is well known worldwide to
print collectors.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#20:1>
Though fewer in number, they can be just as enthusiastic and
passionate as collectors of painting, even to the exclusion of works in oils,
acrylics and watercolors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#21:1>
A common if loose analogy made to distinguish the experience of
paintings from that of drawings and prints is that the former is like an
orchestral work ( symphony, concerto, overture) for their sonority and tonal
richness, while the latter is like chamber music with fewer instrumental
forces ( duo, trio, quartet, etc.) but just as capable of providing listening
experience no less pleasurable, intense and profound than an orchestra in
full cry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#22:1>
Through knowledge and habit, drawings and prints grow on you as
you begin to perceive them in their own right and not simply as cheaper
&ldquo; alternatives &rdquo; to paintings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#23:1>
Interior designers may tell you it is unwise to hang an ink drawing
or a black-and-white woodblock print beside an oil on canvas, or that
drawings and prints look better grouped together.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#24:1>
Nonsense.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#25:1>
If a sketch or an etching has artistic merit, it can hold its own
against anything else beside it except perhaps a mural. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#26:1>
<mention> The Drawing Room </mention> 's 45-sq. - m. white cube
of space is just right for what it intends to showcase.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#27:1>
By their very nature - - generally small-scale and intimate in
ambience - - drawings and prints require close viewing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#28:1>
With a knowledgeable manager on hand to advise beginning collectors
on such matters as conventional relation between the edition size and price (
i.e., the larger the edition, the less expensive the print), Villalon 's
white cube fills in a gap in the local gallery system by supporting and
promoting standard or mainstream fine prints. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#29:1>
Because drawings and prints ( given that they have intrinsic
value and are properly maintained) appreciate in monetary terms, it is
important for a buyer to know standard maintenance requirement: they must be
matted and framed under glass to protect them from dust, grime and grease.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#30:1>
Special attention must be paid to the matboard used in framing:
the ideal is one that is acid-free ( now available in Metro Manila) to
prevent molds from developing on its surface and under the glass component of
the frame.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#31:1>
It would be a boon to collectors if this were made available at
<mention> The Drawing Room </mention> at all times. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#32:1>
The one challenge Villalon 's gallery faces is how to develop a
clientele by knowing how to handle questions commonly asked about prints and
drawings, especially the former. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#33:1>
<h> <bold> What is a print? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#34:1>
Required of dealer, gallery owner and manager is a precise
knowledge of the four general processes for making original prints: the
relief process ( woodcuts, engravings), incised or <foreign> intaglio
</foreign> ( etching, aquatint, mezzotint, drypoint), lithography, and
stencil ( serigraphy, more widely known as silkscreen). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#35:1>
They must also be conversant with the distinct graphic qualities
of each of these four types of printmaking, such as: the striking contrasts
between black and white areas in woodcuts, the silver-toned sharp lines in
etchings, the soft-grained, supple strokes in lithographs, and the often
bright chromatic forms and superfine textures in silkscreens. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#36:1>
They must also be familiar with the various graphic media to be
able to provide information on the practice of limiting the number of copies
in an edition of a print as set by the artist and the obligatory destruction
of the plate once the edition is completed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#37:1>
It takes expertise moreover to inform gallerygoers and beginning
collectors that although multiple copies of a print are pulled out from a
plate, the quality of their individual production is controlled, and that
each copy is an original. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#38:1>
One can do no better than quote from <mention> &ldquo; What Is an
Original Print? &rdquo; </mention> published by the authoritative Print
Council of America, <quote> &ldquo; a nonprofit organization fostering the
creation, dissemination, and appreciation of fine prints, new and old,
&rdquo; </quote> whose membership is a veritable Who 's Who is the
international art world. <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#X39:1>
An <it> original print </it> is a work of graphic art, the
general requirements of which are: 1. The artist alone has made the image in
or upon the plate, stone, woodblock or other material, for the purpose of
creating a work of graphic art. 2. The impression is made directly from that
original material, by the artist or pursuant to his directions. 3. The
finished print is approved by the artist. </p> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#40:1>
A reproduction is something else.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#41:1>
It is made by photomechanical process and is not an original fine
print.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#42:1>
A reproduction is a replica no matter how high-tech or refined
despite concerted efforts by a group a few years back to pass them off in the
gallery system as <mention> &ldquo; works of art, &rdquo; </mention> which
drew considerable reaction from informed quarters who blew the whistle on
this group and was decried by critic Paras-Perez in no uncertain terms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#43:1>
There is nothing wrong, of course, with a gallery dealing in
reproductions, the finer the better, as long as these are sold for what they
are, and not purveyed wittingly or unwittingly as affordable <mention>
&ldquo; works of art. &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#44:1>
<h> <bold> Muddying the waters </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#45:1>
Confusing the issues further at the time was the cavalier
cooperation of certain noted artists who were persuaded to affix their
signatures on photographic reproductions of their drawings which were made
precisely for purposes of reproduction and, therefore, left unsigned.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#46:1>
Signing these superfine photomechanical repros is supposed to signify
their approval of these repros. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#47:1>
There is nothing wrong with that, as long as buyers are <it>
informed </it> of what they are getting: fine-grade if extra-expensive (
thanks to the artists ' signatures) repros/replicas/facsimiles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#48:1>
The trouble is that the artists consenting to this business
arrangement muddy the waters further by allowing their <it> signed repros
</it> to be marketed as <mention> &ldquo; works of art. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#49:1>
This can be misleading: labeling them <mention> &ldquo; works of art
&rdquo; </mention> indicates that they are <it> originals </it> , which of
course they are not, no matter how advanced the technology used may be.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#50:1>
They are no more original than a xerox copy of one 's thumbmark. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#51:1>
<h> <bold> Silkscreens and a sweet tooth </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#52:1>
A common perception of graphic artworks that concerns the
beginning collector is that they are not colorful or bright enough.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#53:1>
In which case, go for silkscreens, or serigraphs, especially those of
a size not likely to be mistaken for chocolate-box illustrations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#54:1>
Undoubtedly silkscreens are the most popular of print media and
the most commercially viable: you can print them by the thousands, as in the
production of T-shirts, posters, streamers and holiday greeting cards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#55:1>
A gallery specializing in prints should be able to guide serious
collectors toward designs specifically created for the silkscreen medium as
of greater artistic interest and collectible value, such as works by Rodolfo
Samonte and Impy Pilapil. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#57:1>
<mention> The Drawing Room </mention> comes at a time when the
Philippine Association of Printmakers is being revitalized by its able
president, Fil Delacruz. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#58:1>
Last month the PAP held <mention> <indig> &ldquo; Kinutkot
Kutkot, &rdquo; </indig> </mention> an exhibition of recent, mostly <foreign>
intaglio </foreign> , works by members that include such dedicated mainstays
in printmaking as Navarro, Paras-Perez, Aviado and Delacruz, and younger
practitioners like Ojeng Jocano, Jess Isidro Flores and Benjie Torrado.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#59:1>
Their show at Gallery Y, lasting less than a week - - <quote> &ldquo;
<indig> Parang pinagbigyan lang kami! </indig> ( Like it was some favor
granted to us!)" </quote> as a PAP member puts it - - is proof positive of
the lackluster interest in prints that prevails today in local art circles.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#60:1>
Two mini-print portfolios, each containing 20 works by as many
artists, have been issued by PAP ( &peso;25,000 per portfolio, or &peso;1,250
per print). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#61:1>
Further evidence of the lack of appreciation of prints is the
terribly underreported traveling show <mention> &ldquo; Prints and Drawings
from Weimar Republic &rdquo; </mention> recently held at Metropolitan Museum
of Manila, which featured such formidable visual artists from a crucial
period of German history as Kathe Kollwitz, Otto Dix, Max Beckmann and George
Grozs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#62:1>
It made a strong case for the emotionally involving graphic power
of prints as a popular medium in a worldclass show that, alas, did not get
the wide publicity it deserved from the Philippine media. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#63:1>
It is hoped <mention> The Drawing Room </mention> can change the
prevailing attitudes toward the graphic arts: not only in reviving greater
interest in them as a genuine source of artistic satisfaction, but also in
clearing the air of the haze that has developed around prints caused by
unscrupulous parties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#64:1>
No reproduction, no matter how state-of-the-art it is, can
replicate the resonance and immediacy of an original fine print.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#65:1>
As the irrepressible Sanso, printmaker <foreign> nonpareil </foreign>
, loves to say by way of comparison: <quote> &ldquo; it 's the difference
between kissing a woman and making a kissing sound to her over the phone.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#66:1>
What a difference! &rdquo; </quote> </p> </I>

TIME was when the likes of the late Vicente Manansala could say,
<quote> &ldquo; I don't have to explain my art.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#70:2>
If I were good with words, I wouldn't be a painter but a writer.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#71:2>
Such excuse for not being verbally articulate once common among
visual artists no longer convinces anyone today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#72:2>
Globalization has made it counterproductive, specially in light of
increased cultural interaction within Asean as well as local and foreign
networks ( CNN, BBC, CNBC) nudging artists to speak up in talk shows, let
alone a growing sophistication in leading galleries such as <mention> Hiraya
</mention> and <mention> Galleria Duemila </mention> urging them to look to
their craft as more than a commodity and product of market forces. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#73:2>
All this is good news, for whatever arouses the public to see art
not only as decor but as an object with a thinking mind behind it - - a
defining drive or body of beliefs - - is welcome. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#74:2>
The last past months have seen notable exhibitions by Emmanuel
Garibay ( Liongoren/Boston), Alfredo Esquillo Jr. ( Hiraya) and Egai
Fernandez ( Genesis) alluding to evangelical and sociocultural motives other
than purely aesthetic ones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#75:2>
And of late two artists in their 40s, Rock Drilon ( Brix) and
Roberto M. A. Robles ( Duemila) have spoken of their art as analogous to
prayer, which is certain to raise the question: When does art become prayer?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-001#76:2>
Or the hackles of the cynical: Are galleries now dealing the
religious card as inspirational ploy in a time of global economic
uncertainty? </p> ... </I>
