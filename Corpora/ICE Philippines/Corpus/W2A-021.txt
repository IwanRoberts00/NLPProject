<bold> Abstract </bold> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#4:1>
Ripamficin is a drug which is rapidly bactericidal against <it>
<foreign> Mycobacterium tuberculosis </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#5:1>
It is used in the short course chemotherapy of tuberculosis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#6:1>
However, resistance to ripamficin has been exhibited by some <it>
<foreign> Mycobacterium </foreign> </it> strains.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#7:1>
This paper reviews the development in molecular analytical methods for
the rapid detection of the presence of resistance to ripamficin in strains of
<it> M. tuberculosis </it> . </p>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#11:1>
Infectious diseases remain the largest cause of death in the
world today and among the infectious diseases, tuberculosis is the leading
cause of mortality <fnr> [ 1] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#12:1>
Annually, more than three million deaths and one-fourth of the world 's
preventable deaths result from this disease.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#13:1>
The thirty-year declining trend in the incidence of tuberculosis in
the United States was dramatically reversed in 1985 primarily as a result of
the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic <fnr> [ 2,3] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#14:1>
To this can be added the role played by increased poverty,
homelessness and inadequate health care in certain cities <fnr> [ 1,3,4]
</fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#15:1>
The use of modern chemotherapy, if properly prescribed and
administered is said to cure 98% to 99% of cases previously untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis if the disease is caused by drug susceptible <it>
<foreign> M. tuberculosis </foreign> </it> <fnr> [ 5] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#16:1>
However, there has been an alarming emergence of drug resistant
isolates, many of which are resistant to multiple drugs <fnr> [ 2-4,3,6-8]
</fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#17:1>
Many of these strains have acquired resistance to almost all first
and second line antitubercular agents <fnr> [ 2,3,6] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#18:1>
Several multiple drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDRTB) outbreaks
have been characterized by mortality rates of 70-90%.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#19:1>
In many cases, there was rapid progression of the disease from
diagnosis to death, with median time of four to six weeks <fnr> [ 2] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#20:1>
Because of the slow growth rate of the organism, it may take from
four to eight weeks for its growth and detection in culture and another three
to four weeks for its response to drugs to be known using conventional drug
susceptibility analyses <fnr> [ 9] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#21:1>
Hence, many of the MDRTB patients died before the drug sensitivity
profiles were determined <fnr> [ 2] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#22:1>
In addition to the high infectivity of tuberculosis, unrecognized
drug resistance increases the risk of transmission both in the community and
in the hospital while the patients receive ineffective therapy pending the
results of drug susceptibility tests <fnr> [ 10] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#23:1>
In several instances, nosocomial transmission of MDRTB from patients
to health workers have been documented <fnr> [ 2,7] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#24:1>
Thus, the emergence of drug resistance in the organism, usually to
multiple drugs, the highly infectious nature of the disease and the immediate
threat to life in some cases, as in patients with TB meningitis, highlight
the need for means of rapidly detecting resistant strains. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#25:1>
Molecular analysis or DNA diagnostic assays have the potential to
provide rapid determination of drug resistance <fnr> [ 2,11-13] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#26:1>
However, the development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tests
requires an understanding of the molecular basis of resistance to the
different drugs in <it> <foreign> M. tuberculosis </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#27:1>
To date, only a few genes have been analyzed in molecular terms for
drug resistance of the organism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#28:1>
These are: the <it> <foreign> rpo B </foreign> </it> gene for
rifampicin resistance, <it> <foreign> gyr A </foreign> </it> gene for
quinolone resistance, <it> <foreign> rsp L </foreign> </it> and <it>
<foreign> rrs </foreign> </it> genes for streptomycin resistance, <it>
<foreign> inh A </foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> kat G </foreign> </it>
genes for resistance to isoniazid <fnr> [ 14] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#29:1>
This paper concerns the developments in molecular analytical
methods as applied to detect the presence of resistance to rifampicin in
strains of <it> <foreign> M. tuberculosis </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#30:1>
Rifampicin is rapidly bactericidal against <it> <foreign> M.
tuberculosis </foreign> </it> <fnr> [ 15] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#31:1>
Together with isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, and together
with isoniazid, it forms part of the initial phase and continuation phase of
treatment of short course chemotherapy recommended by WHO in 1995 <fnr> [ 16]
</fnr> , respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#32:1>
Resistance to rifampicin results in a more prolonged treatment for
the patient and a poor outcome, if the isolate is also resistant to isoniazid
<fnr> [ 15] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#33:1>
In addition, rifampicin resistance is a marker of MDRTH <fnr> [ 3,17]
</fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#34:1>
Hence, the importance of its early detection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#35:1>
To facilitate the presentation of results of the different
studies, the first part of the paper briefly discusses the working principles
of the different analytical methods used in the different papers reviewed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#36:1>
This is followed by the different findings on rifampicin resistance
arrived at by using these methods. </p>

<h> <bold> ANALYTICAL METHODS AND THEIR WORKING PRINCIPLES </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#38:1>
<h> <bold> Polymerized Chain Reaction ( PCR) </bold> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#39:1>
The PCR has become an indispensable tool in the genetic analysis of
drug resistance in <it> <foreign> M. tuberculosis </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#40:1>
This is basically because of the slow growth rate of the organism
which results in long incubation periods for growth and resistance
determination when conventional methods which require its growth are used.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#41:1>
Because of the sensitivity of the method, it can detect the presence
and drug susceptibility of uncultured organisms directly from clinical
samples <fnr> [ 18] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#42:1>
PCR can be used to selectively amplify target sequences that are
present in low abundance in a background of genomic DNA <fnr> [ 19] </fnr> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#43:1>
The PCR amplifies a segment of DNA that is found between two
regions of known sequences.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#44:1>
Two primers, that consist of oligonucleotides, are used for a series
of synthetic reactions that are catalysed by a DNA polymerase.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#45:1>
These oligonucleotides are complementary to sequences that lie on
opposite strands of the template DNA and flank the segment that is to be
amplified <fnr> [ 20] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#46:1>
Thus, the choice of primers is very important as these determine the
DNA segment that will be amplified.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#47:1>
The primers are usually at least 16 nucleotides and preferably 20-24
nucleotides in length.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#48:1>
The usual span between primers for diagnostic assays is 50 to 1,500
nucleotide bases <fnr> [ 19] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#49:1>
The reaction mixture consists of the extracted target DNA either
from cultured organisms or from organisms in clinical specimen, dNTPs ( dATP,
dTTP, dCTP and dGTP), buffer ( Kcl, MgCl, and Tris Cl), the primers and a DNA
polymerase.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#50:1>
Currently, the most widely used DNA polymerase is the thermostable
<it> <foreign> Taq </foreign> </it> polymase purified from the thermophilic
bacteria, <it> <foreign> Thermus aquaticus </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#51:1>
The reaction is carried out in a programmable thermal cycler which is
capable of conducting successive heating and cooling cycles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#52:1>
Each cycle of PCR consists of three steps: 1) Denaturing step:
The target DNA is incubated at high temperature ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> ,
95&degree;C) to allow the target strands to be separated from each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#53:1>
2) Annealing step: The reaction mixture is cooled ( <foreign> e.g.
</foreign> , 55&degree;C) which allows the primers to anneal to their
complementary target sequence and 3) Extension step: The reaction mixture is
brought to a higher temperature intermediate to the denaturation and
annealing temperatures ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> , 70&degree;C).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#54:1>
The primers are extended on the DNA template by the DNA polymerase.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#55:1>
A typical PCR protocol comprises 30 to 50 of this thermal cycles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#56:1>
Theoretically, there is doubling of the target sequence each time a
cycle is completed since each of the DNA strands in the mixture now serves as
a template for the succeeding cycle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#57:1>
Thus, repeating the thermal cycle results in a geometric accumulation
of amplified target sequences <fnr> [ 19,20] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#58:1>
<h> <bold> Nucleotide Sequencing </bold> . </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#59:1>
The two rapid sequencing techniques used currently are the
dideoxymediated chain termination method of Sanger, <it> <foreign> et al.
</foreign> </it> <fnr> [ 21] </fnr> and the chemical degradation method of
Maxam and Gilbert <fnr> [ 22] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#60:1>
Different principles are used in these methods.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#61:1>
The Sanger technique is the current choice for simple determination
of DNA sequence because of its ease and rapidity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#62:1>
Most of the current sequencing strategies have been designed for use
with this method <fnr> [ 20] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#63:1>
For the purpose of this paper, only the Sanger technique is
described. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#64:1>
The working principle of the method is as follows <fnr> [ 20]
</fnr> : <O> figure </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#65:1>
2'3 'ddNTPs differ from conventional dNTPs in the absence of a
hydroxyl residue at the 3' position of deoxyribose.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#66:1>
They are incorporated by DNA polymerase into a growing DNA chain
through their 5' triphosphate groups.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#67:1>
However, formation of a phosphodiester bond with the succeeding dNTP
is prevented because of the absence of a 3' hydroxyl residue.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#68:1>
Hence, further extension of the growing DNA chain does not take
place.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#69:1>
When a small amount of one ddNTP is included with the four
conventional dNTPs ( including radio-labeled dNTPs) in a reaction mixture for
DNA synthesis, there is competition between extension of the chain and the
infrequent, but specific termination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#70:1>
The products of the reaction with DNA polymerase are a series of
oligonucleotide chains whose lengths are determined by the distance between
the terminus of the primer used to initiate DNA synthesis and the site of
premature termination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#71:1>
Four different ddNTPs in four separate enzymatic reactions are used.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#72:1>
Populations of oligonucleotides are generated that terminate at
positions occupied by every A, C, T or G in the template strand.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#73:1>
After denaturation, the radiolabelled oligonuculeotides are separated
by electrophoresis and visualized after autoradiography. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#74:1>
Automatic DNA sequencing uses the same principle but without the
need to use radiolabeled dNTPs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#75:1>
The description that follows was taken from the users manual of the
Applied Biosystems Model 373 DNA Sequencing System.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#76:1>
The dideoxy-sequencing reactions are performed with fluorescent
dye-labeled primers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#77:1>
Dye labels can be incorporated into DNA using either 5' dye-labeled
primers or 3' dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#78:1>
Four different fluorescent dyes distinguish the products from each-of
the four sequencing reactions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#79:1>
The dye-labeled DNA fragments electrophorese through an acrylamide
gel and separate according to size.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#80:1>
When the fragments reach a fixed position above the lower buffer
chamber, the fluorescence of the dyes is excited by light from a laser which
scans back and forth across the area of the gel.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#81:1>
A photomultiplier tube detects the fluorescent light and converts it
into an electrical signal.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#82:1>
The signals are then transmitted to the computer for eventual
processing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#83:1>
<h> <bold> PCR-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism ( SSCP)
Assay </bold> . </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#84:1>
The method is based on the property of separated strands of DNA to
adopt a folded conformation as a result of self complementarity and
intramolecular interactions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#85:1>
The presence of a single nucleotide mutation usually results in an
altered conformation that is shown as a change in DNA strand mobility by
nondenaturing gel electrophoresis <fnr> [ 13] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#86:1>
This method was first developed by Orita, <it> <foreign> et al.
</foreign> </it> <fnr> [ 23] </fnr> to detect polymorphisms of human DNA.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#87:1>
In combination with PCR, SSCP has been widely utilized to detect
mutations in <it> <foreign> Mycobacterium </foreign> </it> sp. which lead to
drug resistance <fnr> [ 3,4,12,13,17,24] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#88:1>
The composition of the sp. reaction mixture is similar to that in the
typical PCR reaction except that a portion of the dCTP component is replaced
by [ alpha- <sp> 32 </sp> P] dCTP.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#89:1>
After amplification, the radiolabeled PCR product is denatured to
single strands and loaded into a nondenaturing sequencing-format gel ( called
mutation detection enhancement MDE gel).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#90:1>
After electrophoresis, the gel is processed for autoradiography. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#91:1>
Compared to nucleotide sequencing which is labor intensive and
requires strong amplification of the DNA, PCR-SSCP allows processing of a
larger number of samples ( <foreign> e.g. </foreign> , 40 samples per gel).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#92:1>
It is being developed for use as a screening procedure for detection
of mutation to rifampicin resistance in <it> M. tuberculosis </it> <fnr> [
18] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#93:1>
This method is a promising technique for direct detection of mutants
in clinical samples. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#94:1>
Telenti <it> <foreign> et al. </foreign> </it> <fnr> [ 13] </fnr>
on the other hand developed a method for PCR for automated SSCP.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#95:1>
In this method, primers for PCR are 5'-labeled with fiuorescein
during the last step of the oligonucleotide synthesis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#96:1>
No substitution of a portion of the dCTP with radiolabeled dCTP is
necessary.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#97:1>
The amplification products are prepared as for the conventional SSCP,
loaded on the nondenaturing sequencing format gel ( MIDE) which is fitted in
an automated sequencer and run overnight.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#98:1>
To correct for small variations in total electrophoresis time,
retention ( detection) times are expressed as relative values by referring
all results to the detection time of the first strand of the control included
in each experiment as reference. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#99:1>
<h> <bold> Nested Amplification </bold> </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#100:1>
This method is a modification of PCR which involves two rounds of
amplification <fnr> [ 19] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#101:1>
The first round is performed with a single primer pair for 15-30
cycles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#102:1>
The products are then amplified in a second round with a second
primer pair that is now specific for the internal sequence amplified by the
first primer pair.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#103:1>
The second amplification usually proceeds for an additional 15 to 30
cycles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#104:1>
The products are then detected by gel electrophoresis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#105:1>
This method may involve the transfer of reaction products from
the first amplification to a new reaction tube for the second round of
amplification ( two-step nested protocol).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#106:1>
This transfer effectively dilutes out inhibitors that might
initially be present in the sample such that suboptimal PCR conditions or
inhibitors are eliminated in the second round of amplification.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#107:1>
This makes nested amplification more sensitive than conventional
PCR.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#108:1>
The presence of a mutation in the isolate results in the formation
of heteroduplexes instead of homoduplexes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#109:1>
The difference is detected after electrophoresis of these duplexes
in the NME gel <fnr> [ 25] </fnr> . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#110:1>
<h> <bold> RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE AND ITS DETECTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#111:1>
The mechanism of action of rifampicin in <it> <foreign> M.
tuberculosis </foreign> </it> is believed to involve interference with
transcription and RNA elongation by binding of the drug to the B subunit of
the plomerase.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#112:1>
The B subunit is coded for by the <it> rpo B </it> gene.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#113:1>
Resistance to rifampicin in <it> <foreign> M. tuberculosis
</foreign> </it> has been identified to be mostly due to mutations in this
gene <fnr> [ 3,12,13,17,24-26] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#114:1>
Mutations leading to substitution of key amino acids in the B
subunit would result in conformation changes and defective binding of the
drug.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-021#115:1>
These changes are responsible for &ldquo; one-step &rdquo; high
level resistance in strains not exposed previously to the antibiotic at a
rate of 10 <sp> - 8 </sp> to 10 <sp> - 7 </sp> <fnr> [ 15] </fnr> . </p> </I>
