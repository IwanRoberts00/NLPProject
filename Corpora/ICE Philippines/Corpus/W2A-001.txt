<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#5:1>
Nearly a century after English was introduced to the Philippines,
the question of whether or not the Filipino has acquired acceptable or better
facility in the language continues to be a major concern among the country 's
leaders and educators.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#6:1>
If comparisons are to be made, today 's English teacher is likely to
receive a less satisfactory rating than his or her counterpart in the first
decade of English language teaching in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#7:1>
The perception is, in fact, that the pioneering group of English
teachers, now conveniently known as <it> Thomasites </it> , has a more
rightful claim to success than the post-war generation of English teachers.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#8:1>
Whatever success then can be attributed to the Thomasites in the
area of English language teaching may be better appreciated if all available
information about the drama, as it were, in which they acted can be presented
again.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#9:1>
If it is true that the Thomasites ' contribution in the area of
English language teaching is monumental, any effort to revisit it will be a
deserved tribute to these pioneer teachers of English in the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#10:1>
While it is true that some studies have been done along this area (
<foreign> e.g. </foreign> Muerman 1992; Quirante 1953; Lardizabal 1956;
Pecson and Racelis 1959; Sibayan and Gonzalez 1990), there is need for more
detailing of the way English was taught by the Thomasites in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#11:1>
Such an effort will explain the phenomenal success of the Americans
in teaching English compared to the lack of success of Spaniards in teaching
Spanish or even of post-war Filipino teachers of English.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#12:1>
What is needed are empirical data which would validate or contradict
the various theories of this historical fact. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#13:1>
<h> <bold> The Thomasites Reintroduced </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#14:1>
As explained in a doctoral study ( Lardizabal 1956: 1), the word
<it> <mention> Thomasite </mention> </it> originated from <it> <mention>
Thomas </mention> </it> , the name given to the ship which transported about
500 American teachers from San Francisco, California to the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#15:1>
As in Lardizabal 's study, the appellation <mention> Thomasites
</mention> is used in this paper as a generic name for the early American
teachers regardless of whether they rode on the transport <it> Thomas </it>
or not.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#16:1>
Although this was not the first or the last ship to carry American
teachers to the Philippines ( <it> Buford </it> , <it> Deric </it> , <it>
Meade </it> , <it> Sherman </it> , and <it> Sheridan </it> were five of the
other ships), it was responsible for transporting the biggest number of
teacher passengers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#17:1>
The fact that it was also the longest and the best of the army
transport on the Pacific at the time may partly explain the stronger
association of its name with the pioneer American teachers transported to
Philippine shores. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#18:1>
With the exception of Arizona, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, and
Oklahoma, all of the American states contributed their share of Thomasites.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#19:1>
The biggest number came from New York; California was next;
Massachusetts ranked third; and Michigan, fourth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#20:1>
Dr. Fred Atkinson, then the General Superintendent of Public
Instruction, explains the recruitment process the Thomasites went through:
<O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#21:1>
Brown ( 1903:247) summarizes the qualifications required of the
applicants: ( 1) either normal or college graduation or an equivalent
education: ( 2) at least two years ' successful experience in school work; (
3) two references who can vouch for moral and personal habits; ( 4) a
satisfactory examination in arithmetic, political and physical geography,
American history and government, general history and current topics,
dictation and grammar, physiology and hygiene, algebra, school methods and
management; ( 5) a physician 's certificate of good health; and ( 6) a
contract to serve two years, and to accept whatever location may be assigned.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#22:1>
The Thomasites were no doubt a well-screened group.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#23:1>
As reported by Muerman ( 1992:42), over 85% of them were either
university, college or normal school graduates.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#24:1>
One-fifth were graduates with no experience, three-fifths had from
one to seven years ' experience, and one-fifth had more than seven years of
experience.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#25:1>
One hundred fifty had A.B. degrees and had a B.S. from reputable
institutions of learning.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#26:1>
Muerman further reports that 21 wrote 'm.A.' after their names and
31, the B.L. degree.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#27:1>
Three had earned Ph.D. degrees, 25, Ph.B., and 118 had graduated from
American schools.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#28:1>
With respect to education and experience, then, the Thomasites were
the finest trained body of teachers America had ever tried to send from its
territory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#29:1>
It is interesting to note that the Thomasites arrived in the
Philippines on August 21, 1901, a time when Filipino-American hostilities
were still intense.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#30:1>
Before long, they had to face threats of dying from tropical diseases
such as cholera, dysentery, and smallpox.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#31:1>
Stuntz ( 1904:194) attempts a moving account of the situation many
Thomasites found themselves in: <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#32:1>
The circumstances under which the Thomasites worked were indeed
very difficult, but their youthful idealism and perhaps missionary spirit
made them persist and survive. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#33:1>
<h> <bold> The Soldier-Teachers: The Thomasites ' Precursors </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#34:1>
Even before the Thomasites came, there were already Americans who
had been teaching English in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#35:1>
These were actually soldiers who doubled as English teachers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#36:1>
This situation came about after the American military authorities
realized that the schools appeared to be effective instruments in convincing
Filipinos of the noble objectives of the new colonizers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#37:1>
Within three weeks after Manila was occupied by the American
forces on August 13, 1898, seven schools were reopened and a teacher of
English was assigned to each of these schools under army jurisdiction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#38:1>
Interestingly, the public schools of the country were operated by the
army for a period of more than two years.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#39:1>
In fact, one of the first military acts after the occupancy of a town
or village was the establishment of the public school, frequently with an
American soldier detailed as teacher.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#40:1>
Although there was little permanent school organization in this
situation, its moral effect was very strong ( Foreman 1917:13). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#41:1>
A popular Catholic priest, Fr. W. D. Mckinnon, who served as
chaplain of the First California Regiment, supervised the first Manila
schools under American control.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#42:1>
In June 1899, Lt. George P. Anderson was designated City
Superintendent of Schools for the Philippine Islands.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#43:1>
In May, 1990, Dr. Fred Atkinson took over the work from Capt. Todd,
the former having been designated as General Superintendent of Public
Instruction by the Philippine Commission.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#44:1>
In the meantime, the military officers and enlisted men continued
with their school assignments even as superintendents and teachers began to
arrive from the United States during the first year of Dr. Atkinson 's
administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#45:1>
Despite their unpreparedness to conduct classes and the unsettled
situation at the time, a good number of the American soldiers did
surprisingly well.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#46:1>
A report made by Gen. William A. Kobbe to the Adjutant General,
Division of the Philippines on Mindanao and Jolo, carries the following
account ( MacArthur 1990:18). <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#47:1>
A Thomasite himself, Muerman ( 1922:25) pays tribute to the
soldier-teachers in the following words. <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#48:1>
The main problem, explains Muerman, was that the soldier-teacher
was not regular in his attendance and the military companies were almost
constantly on the move.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#49:1>
Still and all, Muerman believes that the soldier teachers did the
best they could and paved the way for something more permanent.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#50:1>
Without doubt, the soldier-teachers played a significant role in the
acceptance and success of the civilian Thomasites who were to take over the
instructional work. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#51:1>
<h> <bold> The Thomasite as Teacher of Teachers: Reviewing the Forms
of Teacher Training </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#52:1>
What should perhaps be kept in mind is that the Thomasite was
charged with the task of teaching or training the local teachers, both actual
and prospective ( the name given to the latter was <foreign> <it> <mention>
aspirantes </mention> </it> </foreign> - - teaching aspirants or aspiring
teachers).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#53:1>
In almost all school divisions, every Thomasite was obliged to devote
at least an hour daily to the instruction of the Filipino teacher in English
and in methods of teaching.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#54:1>
His presence was, therefore, a feature of practically all forms of
teacher training - - vacation assemblies, summer schools, normal institutes,
etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#55:1>
Teacher training then was either <it> regular </it> or <it>
special </it> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#56:1>
Under the regular type may be placed the training given at the
Manila, later Philippine, Normal School and the provincial counterparts (
e.g. Cebu, Iloilo, Ilocos Norte) and the training given in the course for
teaching offered in the intermediate schools.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#57:1>
On the other hand, the special type of teacher training included the
conduct of vacation assemblies, division normal institutes, model or
demonstration classes, supervision, and teachers ' meetings. </p>

<p> The <it> <foreign> pensionado </foreign> </it> system, which was
officially established by the General Superintendent of Education through a
circular he issued on March 3, 1904, may be added to the list of regular
forms of teacher training.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#58:1>
This actually consisted of sending a few qualified teachers to the
United States or to the Philippine Normal School for further training along
special lines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#59:1>
The <it> <foreign> pensionados </foreign> </it> were to work either
for a certificate, a bachelor 's degree, or a graduate degree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#60:1>
In the early years of existence of the Philippine Normal School,
the majority, if not all, of the faculty members were expectedly Thomasites.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#61:1>
This was also true of the provincial normal schools.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#62:1>
An attempt to upgrade the academic qualifications of local teachers
was the offering of a course in teaching on the secondary level.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#63:1>
This covered only two years in the provincial school, after which any
student who completed its requirements and who wished to receive further
training in teaching would qualify for admission to the Philippine Normal
School ( PNS).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#64:1>
The final instruction at PNS also required two years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#65:1>
Baguio and Manila were invariably chosen as sites for vacation
assemblies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#66:1>
While the Baguio assembly, which was started in 1908, consisted
largely of conferences, lectures, and classes for supervisors and teachers of
higher professional attainments, the Manila assembly took care of classes in
instructional methods designed for teachers of lower professional
attainments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#67:1>
Summer schools were set up in a number of school divisions as a
means of improving both the academic and professional qualifications of the
<it> <foreign> aspirantes </foreign> </it> or prospective teachers who had
completed only the intermediate grades or who had completed only one or more
years of the secondary course.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#68:1>
Normal institutes, on the other hand, were held in almost all school
divisions at the beginning of the school year in order to provide a few weeks
of intensive training and motivation to elementary school teachers - -
especially to the new recruits among them - - just before their work for the
year began.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#69:1>
As a rule, teachers who had been trained in vacation assemblies
served as instructors, in the normal institutes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#70:1>
In addition to the daily instruction given by the resident
American teacher, the teachers of each province or school division were
gathered together at least once a year for a period of around four to eight
weeks in a normal institute which was first conducted in Manila in April and
May of 1901.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#71:1>
An interesting feature of the normal institute was that even the
simplest matters of class and school organization had to be explained and
illustrated to the teacher participants.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#72:1>
The method of presenting the subject, teaching with the use of
objects ( or things), the conduct of English conversations, etc. were
explained with extreme care and the teachers drilled on these methods.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#73:1>
An instructive account is given by the Superintendent of the Division
of Ilocos Norte, J.M. Knisely, in relation to the manner in which the normal
institute was held in his division ( General Superintendent of Education
1903:755). <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#74:1>
Another superintendent of schools, this time of the Division of
Pampanga and Bataan, William A. Preuitt, describes how the normal institutes
in his division were conducted. <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#75:1>
All the positive comments on the normal institute may be
summarized in the following words from the principal of a Vigan school,
Charles K. Bliss. <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#76:1>
Demonstration or model classes using actual pupils or students
were also conducted to give the teachers a clear, concrete picture of how
they could teach a lesson effectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#77:1>
These classes, which were held in a number of municipalities and in
many of the supervising districts of the country, were observed by many
teachers who would then discuss the work of the model teachers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#78:1>
In normal schools, the 'critic-teacher 's class' was always an
important component, the observation teachers always expected to absorb the 'effective'
methods employed by the critic teacher.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#79:1>
Even the Thomasites themselves had to observe one another 's classes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#80:1>
For instance, the superintendent of the Division of Ilocos Sur and
Abra, G.A. O' Reilley, gives the following report with regard to the holding
of demonstration classes in a normal institute conducted in his division
which had a good supply of American teachers. <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#81:1>
Supervision was perhaps taken very seriously during the
Thomasites ' time.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#82:1>
The supervisor 's task was not just mere inspection but making sure
the teachers knew what they were expected to do.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#83:1>
Despite some fear, the teachers were generally willing to learn from
any supervisor.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#84:1>
In most cases, the Filipino teacher taught one week what he himself
had learned the previous week.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#85:1>
As a result, he had to be constantly assisted, supervised and
instructed by the American teacher. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#86:1>
In the field, the supervisory force consisted of division
superintendents, division supervisors, supervising teachers and principals of
schools ( Director of Education 1924:14).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#87:1>
In spite of the administrative nature of the division superintendent 's
position, this official spent considerable time in the classrooms, usually
with teachers in isolated barrio schools.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#88:1>
Together with the academic supervisor, the industrial supervisor and,
in some divisions, the supervisor of health and hygiene, he was able to give
each teacher in his jurisdiction helpful supervision several times in a
school year.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#89:1>
Each division superintendent of a province had charge over
supervising teachers who attended to matters of school administration in
certain municipalities and supervised the work of teachers in a specific
section of the province. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#90:1>
Supervisors of academic work were appointed in seven divisions.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#91:1>
In Manila, there were three such officers among whom the work was
divided on a grade basis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#92:1>
The main task of these supervisors was to improve the quality of
instruction by personal conferences, observation and discussion of model
lessons, exhibits of school work, tasks of class work, etc. ( Director of
Education 1914:70).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#93:1>
In a few divisions, the tendency was to relieve the division
superintendent of various routine duties by transferring them to the academic
supervisor who was much later considered an indispensable component of the
supervisory scheme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#94:1>
Meetings and conferences also played an important role in the
training and retraining of teachers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#95:1>
At first, even unimportant matters such as the arrangement of the
teacher 's table were discussed in teachers ' meetings, but the need to zero
in on effective teaching methods was eventually seen by those attending the
meetings. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#96:1>
<h> <bold> The Thomasite as a Methods-oriented Teacher </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#97:1>
If there was one thing the Thomasite could not keep his eyes off,
it was how to teach English effectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#98:1>
He was frequently, if not always, concerned with ways or methods
which would bring results.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#99:1>
The buzzword in his time could have aptly been <mention> 'methods,
methods, methods' </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#100:1>
The first few years of the Thomasite period were, understandably
enough, the 'trial-and error' years.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#101:1>
The Thomasite was given almost unlimited freedom to try any method
which he thought would work with his students.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#102:1>
No course of study had to be followed; no 'appropriate' textbook
could be used.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#103:1>
One Thomasite ( Muerman 1922:56) recalls that when he asked the
Superintendent of Public Instruction to give him some suggestions for a
course of study, the reply was, <quote> Go out into your province, make your
own course of study and adapt it to the conditions which surround you
</quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#104:1>
What or how the Thomasites taught did not have to follow the
traditional lines they were so familiar with in the Unites States.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#105:1>
A few of them, however, tried the tips or suggestions given by one
or two soldier-teachers who had remained in the service. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#106:1>
The instruction earlier given by the soldier-teacher had a
considerable oral component ( MacArthur 1900:18), but it could have been a
less methodical version of the 'object-action' method which later became
popular among the Thomasites.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#107:1>
This method actually sought to make the student acquire some basic
vocabulary by introducing to them objects, either actual or in pictures, and
giving them names.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#108:1>
The objects would then be given action ( or verbs) and even
description ( or adjectives).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-001#109:1>
Freer, as paraphrased by Lardizabal ( 1956:152), offers a clearer
description of how this method was employed. <O> Quotation </O> </p> </I>
