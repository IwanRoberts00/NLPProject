other day when I was in Calcutta <O> Speaker B laughs </O> <,> I visited the
grave of Mahatma Gandhi and I was wondering there was this man standing there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#15:1:A>
He was wearing a turban <,> he was wearing a turban and he said <,> 
come and ride with me in my flying carpet <O> Speaker B laughs </O> and I

humor <O> Speaker B laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#25:1:A>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#28:1:A>

Mexicans only sent three hundred men to the Ali Mall <,> Guevara

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#29:1:B>
Why Mr Brias

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#30:1:A>
Because they only had one car <O> Speaker B laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#31:1:B>
Hey the cup is smaller

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#32:1:A>
Right my friend the topic for today is feminism

<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#34:1:A>
<&> still using Mexican accent </&> Feminism as I have told
you <O> Speaker B laughs </O> you are a male chauvinist pig and I have told
you that the feminist movement has many many many valid reasons for its
existence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#35:1:A>
<&> using French accent </&> As I have told you in France we have a
very strong movement of uh feminism <O> Speaker B laughs </O> which was
spearheaded by uh Madam Simone de Beauvoir who was allegedly mistress of Jean
Paul Sartre hmm <O> Speaker B laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#36:1:A>
So I was walking with her one day on the Champs Elysee and I said
 <foreign> ma cherie </foreign> come with me to see beautiful city and we
shall make love together <,> <O> Speaker B laughs </O> and she said piss off
you male chauvinist pig <O> Speaker B laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#37:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#51:1:A>
Well I was in fact the life of the party

Such humility
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#53:1:B>
No kidding <,> how come
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#54:1:B>

Where 's Victor Gojocco

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#73:1:B>
He went home

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#74:1:C>
Why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#75:1:B>
Why <,> I don't know

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#76:1:C>
Why don't you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#77:1:A>
Because he doesn't

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#78:1:B>
Because he didn't tell me why

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#79:1:C>
I see <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#80:1:A>
Well I don't

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#81:1:B>
Do you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#82:1:A>
I don't

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#83:1:B>
Do you call this a discussion

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#84:1:C>
I suppose so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#85:1:B>
No it isn't

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#86:1:C>
Yes it is

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#87:1:A>
I think so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#88:1:B>
It is not

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#89:1:C>
Yes it is

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#90:1:B>
It 's not
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#91:1:B>
No of course not

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#92:1:C>
Yes it is

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#93:1:B>
Come on let 's have a discussion

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#94:1:A>
Bugger off Jimmy

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#95:1:C>
Stop it stop it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#96:1:B>
Victor cool it will you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#97:1:B>
I 'm trying to sip on this coffee
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#98:1:B>
How many more minutes to go

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#99:1:C>
Perhaps now we can begin uh <,,> if you feel it is appropriate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#100:1:A>
So Jimmy what do you think about this issue that McIntyre
talks about in <mention> After Virtue </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#101:1:B>
Interesting

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#102:1:A>
That 's a very boring answer Jimmy <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#103:1:A>
You 're not risking anything by saying that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#104:1:B>
Exciting

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#105:1:A>
It 's very boring <,> as well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#106:1:B>
Well remember what I told you in the faculty canteen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#107:1:B>
You made me think about something else <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#108:1:C>
Yeah like

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#109:1:B>
Yeah you know like he starts off by saying by giving out all
the examples <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#110:1:A>
Can you speak up please I can't hear you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#111:1:B>
And why there seems to be no standard by which to weigh the
rival premise of the other

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#112:1:A>
Do you remember what I replied to that theory of yours

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#113:1:B>
Not quite

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#114:1:A>
I said it was just a load of senseless drivel <,> <O> Speaker
B laughs </O> totally incoherent <O> Speaker B laughs </O> and absolutely
wanting in sense

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#115:1:B>
Well you see that 's your opinion

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#116:1:A>
Well that 's that you 're taking the <?> emotivist </?> 
position right now Jimmy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#117:1:A>
The point is how

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#118:1:B>
So how can we say who is right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#119:1:B>
How do we overcome the incommensurability of these uh-hum premises

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#120:1:A>
More premises

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#121:1:B>
Well I think we have to discover the <foreign> luminon
 </foreign> huh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#122:1:A>
Well

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#123:1:B>
Then we 'll have the rational basis
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#124:1:B>
But then again it 's unknown so what the heck right <,> the
 <foreign> luminon </foreign> aha

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#125:1:A>
The <foreign> luminon </foreign> is dead

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#126:1:B>
The <foreign> luminon </foreign> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#127:1:A>
Well no need to drift into this <foreign> luminon </foreign> 
realm of reality Mr Guevara

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#128:1:B>
Yes Dr Brias I suppose you 're very right about that

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#129:1:C>
So where do we drift into

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#130:1:A>
Oh Prof Guevara
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#131:1:A>
Take Freudian example you might say we might be drifting back into
the <O> coughs </O> <,> excuse me uh but uh jokes aside <,> please continue
with your theoretical expos&eacute;

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#132:1:B>
But as of now they 're very incoherent

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#133:1:C>
Which <mention> they </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#134:1:B>
My ideas I guess
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#135:1:B>
How many more minutes to go

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#136:1:A>
Hey uh Jimmy should I say Prof Guevara since this is a
serious <{> <[> discussion </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#137:1:B>
<[> Yes yes </[> </{> Dr Brias what is it <,,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#138:1:A>
Don't you think that life is beautiful
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#139:1:A>
Aren't these beautiful feelings so wonderful <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#140:1:A>
Don't you just feel like rising up jumping and saying <mention> 
praise the Lord hallelujah I 'm saved </mention> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#141:1:B>
Yes I do Victor I really do I mean I believe in God you know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#142:1:A>
Point well taken <O> Speaker B laughs </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#143:1:C>
What a life

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#144:1:A>
What do you think Jimmy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#145:1:B>
Yes but a woman has a right to her own body

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#146:1:C>
Yeah of course
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#147:1:C>
That means if she 's pregnant <,> does she uh does that mean she
is permitted to abort the baby that she has

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#148:1:B>
Ahh good point <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#149:1:B>
You think uh you think that a woman is only as old as the man she
feels

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#150:1:C>
As a what <,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#151:1:B>
I 'll repeat the question
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#152:1:B>
You think a woman is only as old as the man she feels <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#153:1:A>
Or to say that chauvinistically do you think the man is only
as old as the woman he feels

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#154:1:B>
I think that is said more appropriately now Dr Brias

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#155:1:A>
I think so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#156:1:A>
Hey Jimmy could you ask your wife to cut her nails my back 's a
mess <O> Speaker B laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#157:1:B>
That 's a good joke Vic good joke

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#158:1:A>
You know Jimmy 's wife likes to talk while she has sex so she
called him up the other day from her hotel room

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#159:1:B>
And then what happened

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#160:1:A>
You tell us <O> Speaker B laughs </O> <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#161:1:A>
I believe that God is everywhere

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#162:1:B>
Where

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#163:1:A>
Everywhere

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#164:1:B>
Where 's that

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#165:1:A>
All around

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#166:1:B>
Where 's all around <,> in heaven and in hell as St Augustine
would say

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#167:1:A>
<{> <[> You know </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#168:1:B>
<[> Is he </[> </{> in you also

<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#169:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-088#170:1:A>
