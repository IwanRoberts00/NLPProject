the Makati district but if you go down Ayala Avenue you will see that there
are people uh there are formal groups uh Gabriela uhm student bodies that
have that have been trying to get into Ayala Avenue since an hour ago but who
have been stopped because of the number of people along Ayala Avenue

Ron back to you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#22:1:B>
Thank you Jing Magsaysay and Pinky Webb reporting live from
Ayala Makati
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#23:1:B>
Meanwhile from Makati we move on to the Luneta area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#24:1:B>
I believe the mood remains festive there as more and more <foreign> 
El Shaddai </foreign> members flock for tonight 's celebration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#25:1:B>
Karmina Constantino is there and she gives us this update
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#26:1:B>
Karmina

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#27:1:C>
Thanks Ron
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#28:1:C>
Roasted cows and pigs are not the only one from the menu today it
seems like members of the <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> Charismatic
Movement have also developed an appetite for roads and any available space
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#29:1:C>
There is no stopping them from flocking to the Quirino Grandstand
today to celebrate their founder 's birthday and the group 's fifteenth
anniversary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#30:1:C>
We 're here at the tenth floor of the Manila Hotel where we 've
been closely monitoring the influx of followers of <foreign> El Shaddai
 </foreign> and let me tell you Ron they 've been pretty consistent in
furthering their number
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#31:1:C>
They 've already taken over a great portion of Roxas Boulevard
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#32:1:C>
Let 's talk some figures here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#33:1:C>
The Western Police District estimates the Grandstand to accommodate
about four hundry or four hundred and eighty thousand people and that 's only
talking about the immediate environs of the Grandstand alone that 's about
four people per square meter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#34:1:C>
And if the crowd spills over to Roxas Boulevard which it has
already the figure according to the W P D estimates will only amount to half
a million that 's five hundred thousand and judging from what we 're looking
at over here that 's I think uh a rough estimate is about five hundred
thousand people we 're looking at right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#35:1:C>
And that 's a far cry from the three to five million mark estimated
by the <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> group
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#36:1:C>
But see it 's still quite early in the day also sporadic rains may
have delayed the arrival of some groups
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#37:1:C>
But Ron whether it 's a crowd of five hundred thousand or five
million W P D Director Chief Superintendent Efren Fernandez assures there are
more than enough policemen securing the area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#38:1:C>
Aside from the one thousand four hundred policemen from the Special
Action Force the Western Police District and the Regional Mobile Group have
also deployed an additional uh two thousand policemen to strategic points in
the area to make sure any untoward incidents will not disrupt today 's event
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#39:1:C>
Ron we 're about an hour and a half into today 's celebration and
so far no arrests have been made
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#40:1:C>
However our roving reporter Macel Ingles uhm have has told us
rather policemen downstairs are already having a hard time patrolling the
 <indig> lechon </indig> lines as some members of the <foreign> El Shaddai
 </foreign> Charismatic Movement are trying to get into to get in front of the
line to take part of today 's feast
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#41:1:C>
Now in spite of that Chief Superintendent Efren Fernandez is
optimistic it 's gonna turn out to be a peaceful day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#42:1:C>
Their main concern right now is traffic and crowd control <O> 
interview clip </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#43:1:C>
Alright
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#44:1:C>
Traffic enforcers from the Traffic Management Bureau have already
begun re-routing traffic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#45:1:C>
The portion of Roxas Boulevard going to Pasay has already been
taken over by members of the <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> Charismatic
Movement and north bound vehicles are also having a hard time going through
the crowd
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#46:1:C>
And judging from the way it looks up here I think Ron we 're only
counting minutes before the whole of Roxas Boulevard is gonna be taken over
by members of the <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> Charismatic Movement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#47:1:C>
Reporting live from the Manila Hotel I 'm Karmina Constantino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#48:1:C>
Back to you Ron

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#49:1:B>
Karmina Constantino from the Manila Hotel
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#50:1:B>
Now we move closer to the festivities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#51:1:B>
We have Miranda de Quiros reporting from the Quirino Grandstand
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#52:1:B>
Miranda <O> music </O> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#53:1:D>
Thank you Ron
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#54:1:D>
The rains will not dampen the spirit of the members of the
 <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#55:1:D>
They are on their feet now singing and dancing to their favorite
gospel songs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#56:1:D>
They call this part of the celebrations <mention> the joyful
worship </mention> and they are literally expressing their happiness as they
praise their <foreign> Yahweh El Shaddai </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#57:1:D>
Earlier we also heard some members deliver their testimonies on how
their lives were touched by the Lord
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#58:1:D>
While the program is going on other members are still lining up to
get their share of the roasted calves and pigs Brother Mike Velarde had in
store for the <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> members in his sixteenth in his
sixtieth birthday thanksgiving <indig> salu-salo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#59:1:D>
The <foreign> El Shaddai </foreign> members have been lining up by
the food stalls as early as ten o'clock this morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#60:1:D>
At three o'clock this afternoon a helicopter would be going around
the Quirino Grandstand to drop Miracle Christian Souvenirs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#61:1:D>
After that the birthday celebrant Brother Mike will be leading the
members through an offering prayer and then they will be releasing the
balloons they brought with their wishes and prayers written on it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#62:1:D>
President Joseph Estrada is also expected to grace the event and
deliver an inspirational message at around five o'clock this afternoon <O> 
music </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#63:1:D>
That 's it for now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#64:1:D>

A little later there will be a message from former President
Corazon Aquino and a liturgy from uh Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#78:1:A>
There are around fifteen to twenty thousand people here right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#79:1:A>
I am on top of a platform uh and uh in the background you can see
just part of the huge crowd that have gathered here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#80:1:A>
Uh this crowd stretches up to the end of Ayala Avenue towards
Buendia and Paseo de Roxas is filled from end up to the other end and this
goes all the way down the road
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#81:1:A>
There are around a little while ago there were around fifteen to
twenty thousand people now they they are there are about some twenty-five
upwards to thirty thousand people gathered here right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#82:1:A>
It is uh quite impossible to move around the central area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#83:1:A>
As you can see the people who have been here since this morning are
sort of stuck here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#84:1:A>
Uhm it 's been raining on and off people <.> can </.> can't move uh
people are drenched already
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#85:1:A>
Umbrellas spring up whenever the rain falls and they come down like
they 're down now when it 's just drizzling
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#86:1:A>
Confetti has been showering since this morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#87:1:A>
We came here at around four this morning to set up the <indig> 
Sarimanok </indig> News Network live coverage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#88:1:A>
There was no one here early this morning except the media
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#89:1:A>
But people started trickling in at around six o'clock this morning
from various parts of the Philippines even even people from Saudi Arabia as
uh Pinky earlier reported have come home to attend this rally
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#90:1:A>
The rally according to organizer Noel Tolentino he is just one of
the organizers was was uh was organized to bring to the attention of
President Estrada certain issues because allegedly according to them they
could not get these issues straight to the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#91:1:A>
I guess an audience would be in order
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#92:1:A>
Uhm some of these issues are of course uh charter change uhm uh the
economic provisions of the charter change and uh there are provisions
specific to certain sectors of society
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#93:1:A>
There are provisions from the farmers provisions from uh proposals
from fishermen proposals from businessmen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#94:1:A>
A little while ago we interviewed uh Pastor Saycon who was a
vice-president of the Management Association of the Philippines and who just
resigned from that Association due to circumstances that have been uh that
have been uh uncontrolled circumstances that have been coming his way the
past days
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#95:1:A>
But he resigned and we had that interview this morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#96:1:A>
This program is scheduled to go on until four o'clock this
afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#97:1:A>
We will stay with the program until four o'clock this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#98:1:A>
We 'd like now to turn you over to the stage where the program is
in progress <&> break in recording </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#99:1:A>
<&> missing words </&> venues at the same time so you can see
for yourself what 's going on here in Makati and what 's going on at the
Luneta uh

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#100:1:E>
To give them an ultimate <indig> ano </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#101:1:A>
Okay

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#102:1:E>
Uhm Karmina Constantino had earlier told us that the crowd
 <indig> daw </indig> in uh Luneta is reaching about five hundred thousand

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#103:1:A>
That 's a big crowd

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#104:1:E>
Yeah
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#105:1:E>
But a far cry <indig> pa rin daw </indig> from the three million
expected <indig> doon sa </indig> Luneta

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#106:1:A>
Okay okay

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#107:1:E>
On the other hand <indig> naman </indig> here in Ayala Avenue
 <indig> padami ng padami ang tao </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#108:1:A>
<indig> Oo </indig> a little while ago I said there were
thirty thousand but I took a short walk because a short walk is all I can
take because you can't get too far

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#109:1:E>
That 's right

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#110:1:A>
And uh there are there must be around fifty to sixty thousand
people here already
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#111:1:A>
They were expecting something like fifteen to twenty thousand to
come here today

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#112:1:E>
That 's right <indig> oo ang sabi pa </indig> maximum thirty
thousand but as it is now it 's doubled

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#113:1:A>
Yeah uhm there are so many people they have overflowed into
the cordoned-off area that we have right here
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#114:1:A>
Pinky and I are on top of a platform that is around six feet high
uh that 's the only reason we 're not crowded in but a lot of our countrymen
are shoulder-to-shoulder literally uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#115:1:A>
And at this height from the platform we could feel the body heat
coming off the crowd and coming through the air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#116:1:A>
Uh yellow confetti has been permeating the air since this morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#117:1:A>
What is going on right now at the stage is that they have been
saying prayers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#118:1:A>
Pinky has been following the prayers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#119:1:A>
Uhm they we they are at the prayers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#120:1:A>
You see what they 're doing is they 're delivering the issues to
President Estrada in the form of prayers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#121:1:A>
So ever since we started we started with the national anthem and
then ecumenical opening prayer from a Catholic representative a Protestant
representative a Muslim representative and then uh we had opening songs and
then the prayer petitions from sectors and groups

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#122:1:E>
<indig> Yan mga </indig> various sectors <indig> yun mga <{1> 
 <[1> <,> </[1> mga mambubukid uh mananalakal </indig> all all all the sectors
what they uh Noel Tolentino is actually briefing us in all these is uh
briefing us on the media what actually is going to happen today uh
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#123:1:E>
And <indig> sabi nga niya </indig> is that they decided <indig> 
daw kasi Jing uhm medyo nahihirapan silang i- </indig> penetrate <indig> si
Presidente Erap </indig> so <indig> ang ginawa nila </indig> <{2> <[2> <,> 
 </[2> instead of tongue lashing <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#124:1:E>
They wanted to do it through a prayer kind of like a prayer
 <indig> sa </indig> various sectors <indig> may </indig> representative
 <indig> kunwari ang mambubukid meron silang </indig> prayer <indig> na
sariling kanila yung mga <.> mangaga </.> mangangalakal meron silang sariling
 </indig> prayers <indig> para sa kanila </indig> 

 <$A>

mangangalakal at propesyunal </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#129:1:A>
I 'd like to stress a point here which was conveyed to us by the
organizers earlier today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#130:1:A>
It 's noisy here so we we can't hear <indig> nahihirapan din kami
 </indig> we can't hear the the commands from the control van
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#131:1:A>
Uh anyway like I said various prayers are are now being delivered
right here in Makati
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#132:1:A>
Uh what we 're looking forward to is the singing of <mention> 
 <indig> Ama Namin </indig> </mention> the reading of the sacred scripture uhm
the homily the reading of a joint statement uh <mention> <indig> Manindigan
Tayo sa Demokrasya </indig> </mention> a presentation of a signed statement
 <mention> A Covenant for Democracy </mention> to Cardinal Sin and former
President Cory Aquino the signing of the Covenant by Cardinal Sin and former
President Cory Aquino and of course uh the final is the speech from former
President Cory Aquino and closing songs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#133:1:A>
We expect these to go on at around till around four this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-003#134:1:A>
