The Chairman of the Committee is recognized to continue to sponsor the bill

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#2:1:B>
Uh Mr Speaker uh the the uh third uh sponsorship speech uh having been delivered by the lady from Pasay the joint committee uh manifests that uh uh there are no more sponsorship speeches and that we move to uh uh the committee is ready for interpellations <,> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#3:1:A>
There being no interpellator <{> <[> the Majority Floor Leader </[>

<[> Mr Speaker there being <unclear> words </unclear> </[> </{>

<{> <[> Mr Speaker </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#6:1:A>
<[> The gentleman </[> </{> from the first district of Sorsogon is recognized

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#7:1:D>
Thank you Mr Speaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#8:1:D>
Will the distinguished uh sponsor yield to a few questions Mr Speaker

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#9:1:B>
Uh most certainly uh Mr Speaker and with great pleasure knowing that the <.> expi </.> experience of the gentleman from Sorsogon will uh enhance uh the bill being discussed

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#10:1:D>
Thank you Your Honor <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#11:1:D>
Your Honor this representation is in accord <,> with the committee and the sponsors of this uh piece of legislation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#12:1:D>
But at the same time this representation entertains a lot of doubt whether the creation of a council will really serve the purposes or the interest of the small and medium-scale entrepreneurs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#13:1:D>
The reason being it is a standard impression that is getting to be a joke in the bureaucracy that if you want something to fail you refer it either to a committee or to a council
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#14:1:D>
In fact the number one <,,> or what I would say an exhibit A of a council that is not effective at all is the National Security Council that has never been convened for the past four to five years
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#15:1:D>
And so Your Honor <,> my first question is that rather than creating a council did the committee study the possibility of just simply strengthening giving all of these functions to the still existing Bureau of Small and Medium-Scale Office

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#16:1:B>
Uh that was actually uh considered by uh the joint committee uh Mr Speaker
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#17:1:B>
But in reply to the query of uh the gentleman from Sorsogon <,> the matter of coordinating the various efforts of the various agencies was also brought to <?> fore </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#18:1:B>
Uh the joint committees uh determined that the mere <?> fortification </?> of the functions of one body would not be sufficient because the solution lies in a uh complete approach which would involve several agencies of the government that have uh uh something to do with the promotion of small and medium enterprises
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#19:1:B>
And uh a full coordination of these uh functions uh belonging to these bodies was uh considered as uh essential together with of course the specification of definite directions which are laid down in the proposed bill

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#20:1:D>
Thank you Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#21:1:D>
Does it mean therefore Your Honor that for us to expect the various departments to have coordinated policies to have coordinated actions there is always a need to include the various departments in a particular cluster and therefore compose a council
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#22:1:D>
Meaning it is not feasible Your Honor for these various departments to make coordination an inherent character considering that anyway these cabinet members are coordinated by the Office of the President

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#23:1:B>
Uh Mr Speaker it is not only uh the uh department or cabinet secretaries who are presently involved in the uh uh development of uh small and medium industries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#24:1:B>
There are sub-cabinet uh offices and agencies which are involved
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#25:1:B>
As a matter of fact there are something like thirty agencies uh which have something to do with small and medium enterprises
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#26:1:B>
Now to the question of the gentleman from Sorsogon uh it is not essential to include all thirty but only the more relevant and more important agencies with the important functions

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#27:1:D>
Thank you Your Honor <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#28:1:D>
Your Honor a commendable feature of this particular Council is the fact that the Chairman will be selected appointed by the President from amongst the representatives of the private <,> sector
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#29:1:D>
May the distinguished sponsor give us if any examples of present government councils headed by a private sector representative as a chairman so that we could have an impression as to whether such an arrangement indeed is workable

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#30:1:B>
I can think of only one uh uh although there might be others
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#31:1:B>
But at the moment I can come up with only one example which is the uh uh P A P or the Philippine Assistance Program <,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#32:1:D>
Thank you Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#33:1:D>
At least uh before the Chairman resigned that particular agency was performing I would say above uh average

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#34:1:B>
And if I if I may add uh Mr Chairman it is still performing above average which only goes to show that uh this particular uh Council <mention> i e </mention> the P A P uh is uh functioning not because of a particular personality but because of the structure and the members included therein

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#35:1:D>
I wish indeed that uh such uh was the case
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#36:1:D>
Mr Chairman Mr Speaker Your Honor I don't see any budgetary appropriation for this <,> Council

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#37:1:B>
Uh we we <{> <[> have this uh </[> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#38:1:D>
<[> Do we </[> </{> expect this Council to be effective without any budgetary uh appropriation

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#39:1:B>
Well there is uh Mr uh Speaker <,> a uh <,> section namely section seven which designates the Bureau of Small and Medium Enterprise Development as the Council Secretariat
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#40:1:B>
Since that particular agency has its own budget then uh the joint committee felt that uh the budget for the <.> operate </.> operating uh <.> ope </.> operations of this particular Council could be drawn from uh said uh uh agency <,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#41:1:D>
May we know Your Honor what uh <,> is the present budget of this particular office in our uh Appropriations Act for nineteen ninety-nine nineteen ninety

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#42:1:B>
I I do not have the exact figure but uh I 'm sure the uh General Appropriations Act for nineteen ninety would uh easily give that information

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#43:1:D>
I hope Your Honor it is significant enough to be able to finance the additional functions to be given to that uh office
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#44:1:D>
<{> <[> Another </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#45:1:B>
<[> Actually </[> </{> actually Mr Speaker while uh the Bureau of Small and Medium Enterprise Development will be the Council Secretariat the uh coordination which will be done among the various agencies which I mentioned before would also involve said agencies and therefore uh in a way would also involve part of their part of their uh budgets

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#46:1:D>
Thank you Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#47:1:D>
Your Honor for the information of the members of the chamber may we know how this particular bill would jibe with an earlier piece of legislation the House already approved
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#48:1:D>
This representation is referring to the Plaza Bill from Agusan on uh the overall economic umbrella on organization a bill which has been pending in the Senate for almost two to three months <,,> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#49:1:B>
Uh Mr Speaker uh in order for this representation to uh uh fully uh answer the query of the gentleman from <.> Sorso </.> from Sorsogon may I request for a one-minute suspension

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#50:1:A>
Session suspended <&> break in the recording </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#51:1:A>
Session resumed

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#52:1:B>
Mr Speaker the bill of uh <,> Honorable D O Plaza makes or provides for a business information center
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#53:1:B>
Meaning uh the thrust uh is uh focused on the dissemination of business information
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#54:1:B>
However the bill in question or uh the bill under consideration is not confined to the dissemination of business information because uh the bill encompasses uh the development of technology the uh facilitation of credit and the development of markets
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#55:1:B>
So uh if this representation will be allowed to capsulize the difference while the bill of Honorable D O Plaza is specialized focusing on one particular activity the bill under consideration uh has for its uh objective uh the performance of several functions

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#56:1:D>
Thank you uh Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#57:1:D>
My final uh question uh Your Honor or maybe an observation is that insofar as councils wherein various secretaries or heads of departments are represented are involved the common experience of this representation is that invariably these various heads of departments would send their representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#58:1:D>
Good enough if they would send their immediate deputy or undersecretary
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#59:1:D>
But considering that the Secretary of Trade and Industry most especially I understand he sits in as many as nineteen or twenty board offices I doubt very much really Mr Speaker Your Honor whether the good Secretary of Trade and Industry the Secretary of Agriculture Secretary of Labor and Employment would have the time to sit in this Council
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#60:1:D>
So I hope the sponsors would consider the possibility of having as members of the Council sub-cabinet personalities who will indeed represent their various departments in practically full-time <.> capab </.> uh capacity

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#61:1:B>
We uh concur with the observation of the gentleman from Sorsogon that uh in most uh councils and or committees where department secretaries are <foreign> ex-officio </foreign> members or are members by reason of their position most of the uh members send subalterns who are invariably well or almost invariably unfamiliar with the uh uh task involved and worse uh no continuity uh is uh observed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#62:1:B>
In other words uh a particular department secretary would send for one week uh subaltern A and then for the second week subaltern B and for the third week subaltern C
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#63:1:B>
Uh there is no continuity of effort and uh as a result the work of the council and or the committee is uh jeopardized
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#64:1:B>
We are amenable to uh an amendment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#65:1:B>
As a matter of fact the committee uh is even offering to present that as one of the committee amendments to uh stipulate in the bill that uh a specific undersecretary for example uh shall be uh uh the only acceptable uh substitute or representative of the member who might be in uh who might be unable to attend

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#66:1:D>
Thank you Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#67:1:D>
Thank you Mr Speaker

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#68:1:E>
Mr Speaker

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#69:1:A>
Yes what is the pleasure of the gentleman from Quezon

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#70:1:E>
Uhm will the uh Honorable sponsor the Chairman on the Committee on Trade and Industry yield to some questions Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#71:1:B>
Uh with uh pleasure Mr Speaker to the gentleman from Quezon who has uh uh incorporated in his uh political philosophy the assistance to small uh uh to small uh business uh concerns in our country

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#72:1:E>
Thank you Your Honor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#73:1:E>
Uh I suppose uh that in uh the drafting of this proposed measure the committee was uh also guided by the experience of uh South Korea and Taiwan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#74:1:E>
Am I correct Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#75:1:B>
Uh to a certain uh and substantial extent yes Mr Speaker

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#76:1:E>
And uh I understand that these economies before they uh engaged in full industrialization uh took off from small and medium-scale enterprises Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#77:1:B>
Uh that is correct Mr Speaker and uh we uh we would like to uh learn from the lessons uh from successful lessons uh of our neighbors

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#78:1:E>
And and these economies were able to do that by uh imposing more commitment and better coordination among uh the government agencies in small and uh medium-scale uh enterprises in their countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#79:1:E>
Am I correct Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#80:1:B>
Uh that is uh very accurate Mr Speaker

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#81:1:E>
I am asking these questions Your Honor uh uh because I would like to know what government agencies are presently involved in the promotion of small and medium-scale enterprises in this country

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#82:1:B>
Well uh Mr Speaker uh definitely the Department of Trade and Industry is involved in a big way
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#83:1:B>
The uh the Department of Agriculture is likewise uh very concerned with uh small and medium enterprises especially uh those uh in the agricultural or agro-industrial field
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#84:1:B>
The Secretary of Labor and Employment uh since uh its vision is to provide employment and it looks at small and medium enterprises as a rich source of uh uh generating employment
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#85:1:B>
The uh Secretary of Finance because it is the fund generator of the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#86:1:B>
Uh the uh National Economic and Development Authority because uh insofar as uh high policy or top policy matters are concerned it can be deemed as the coordinator uh among others uh Mr Speaker

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#87:1:E>
I understand Your Honor that presently the the efforts of the Departments of Trade Agriculture Labor Finance NEDA uhm towards uh promoting small and uh medium scale enterprises are not uh adequately coordinated at present
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#88:1:E>
That 's why there is need uh for us to come up with a measure such as the measure under consideration
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#89:1:E>
Am I correct Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#90:1:B>
That is correct Mr Speaker because aside from uh the small and medium enterprises uh matters uh these agencies and the others who are involved in small and medium enterprises also have to attend to a myriad of uh other activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#91:1:B>
And the reason for uh the creation of the Council is to ensure that within that milieu the concentration of their coordination will be towards small and medium enterprises

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#92:1:E>
And I suppose that uh the Council proposes to effect uh better coordination and integration uh through its authority in the promulgation of guidelines programs and operating principles which I take it will uh be implemented by the other government agencies tasked with uh the promotion of small-scale and uh medium-scale <.> enter </.> enterprises Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#93:1:B>
Uh that is correct Mr Speaker uh because aside from the fact that the proposed bill provides for the composition of the Council it also provides certain legislative standards that the uh Council must follow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#94:1:B>
And uh uh it is the these legislative standards can be compared to an outline or to a framework
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#95:1:B>
And it will it will be the uh duty of the Council to supply the details

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#96:1:E>
So that uh by means of uh guidelines programs operating principles uh common to all government agencies implementing the promotion the government policy on the implementation of uh small and medium scale industries we would be able to avoid uh overlapping of functions duplication and even confusion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#97:1:E>
Am I correct Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#98:1:B>
Uh that is uh correct more uh more more uh importantly the last mainly confusion

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#99:1:E>
And I think that we should adopt this measure
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#100:1:E>
Thank you Your Honor

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-053#101:1:B>
And thank you also uh to the gentleman from uh Quezon 

 </I>
