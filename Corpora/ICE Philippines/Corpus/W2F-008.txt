<bold> Katrina B. Villa </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#3:1>
SHE saw the handwriting on the envelope, and recognized it
immediately.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#4:1>
Her mother was going through the day 's mail and had handed the letter
to her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#5:1>
<quote> &ldquo; No sender 's name, just a return address in New
Jersey.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#6:1>
Anyone I know? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#7:1>
She told her mother no, guilty at having to lie.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#8:1>
Her mother seemed satisfied with her explanation that it was from a
classmate who had migrated.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#9:1>
It wasn't entirely untrue.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#10:1>
Would it upset her if she found out it was from him?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#11:1>
He was in New Jersey after all.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#12:1>
Wasn't that distance enough from her daughter? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#13:1>
He had been gone now for half a year.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#14:1>
She was not expecting to hear from him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#15:1>
Had stopped expecting, since she had already put away all thoughts
and unanswered questions about him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#16:1>
It was how she dealt with the vague sense of loss she felt each time
he came to mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Loss? &rdquo; </quote> she imagined her mother
saying if she knew how she felt.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; For God 's sake, Gina, don't be so melodramatic!
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#19:1>
She held the unopened envelope.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#20:1>
She felt more alone than ever.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#21:1>
She looked at her mother, who was now standing in the kitchen with
her back to her daughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#22:1>
She was talking to someone on the telephone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#23:1>
AS a child, she had been fascinated by her mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#24:1>
She remembered looking through the stair railings down at the parties
her mother often gave.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#25:1>
She would picture herself weaving invisibly through the well-dressed
crowd below.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#26:1>
Like a soft wind she would move around stranger after glittering
stranger until she found her mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#27:1>
There she would be, in conversation with one of her guests.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#28:1>
Gina would pretend that she was that guest, the happy recipient of
her mother 's attention.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#29:1>
Her mother would listen patiently to what she was saying.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#30:1>
Then she would smile, and at that moment she would become real to her
daughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#31:1>
The distance and the coldness would disappear, and how she would love
that time with her mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#32:1>
At all other times, her mother treated her with a formality she
did not understand.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#33:1>
To her daughter she was a doll in a store window.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#34:1>
Perfect, needed, untouchable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#35:1>
As she grew older, she began to piece together details of her
mother 's life.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#36:1>
She gathered them from conversations, stories told never by asking,
but only by waiting and listening.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#37:1>
She wanted explanations to her mother 's inaccessibility. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#38:1>
Time and again she would be told of the sacrifices her mother had
made for her daughter 's security and reputation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#39:1>
<quote> &ldquo; When your father left you had nothing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#40:1>
Thanks to your mom, look where you are now! &rdquo; </quote> a
<indig> Tita </indig> <&> =aunt </&> had told her once. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#41:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Your mother worked hard to give you everything
you have now, &rdquo; </quote> another said, <quote> &ldquo; You must be
grateful and love her for that. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#42:1>
She tried to tell them she knew, and that she was truly grateful.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#43:1>
If there was anyone who loved her mother, it was she.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#44:1>
From childhood she searched for ways to let her mother know this, and
she waited for some sign that she was getting through.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#45:1>
Reassurance came in the form of other people 's comments.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#46:1>
Her mother 's friends would remark on what a wonderful daughter she
had.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#47:1>
Her mother would smile, and then proceed to tell them of Gina 's
latest achievement in school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#48:1>
She would go on and on about her daughter, and this was how she knew
that her mother loved her back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#49:1>
Her mother took pride in the fact that she had raised a child
alone so well.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#50:1>
<quote> &ldquo; An absent father is never an excuse, &rdquo; </quote>
she would be told whenever she was less than the daughter she was expected to
be.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#51:1>
This meant a number of things to her mother: good grades, impeccable
manners.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#52:1>
Gratitude.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#53:1>
Obedience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#54:1>
It wasn't difficult to obey her mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#55:1>
In fact, it was effortless.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#56:1>
As she grew older, she saw that wanting what her mother wanted
brought them together.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#57:1>
Between them there was none of the tension Gina 's friends always
seemed to have with their own mothers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#58:1>
It was a simple existence being her mother 's daughter once she
understood the importance of obeying her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#59:1>
Their life together was clear and smooth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#60:1>
THE first time she told her mother about him, her mother listened
thoughtfully.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#61:1>
Twice a week that semester, she parked her car in front of the same
building to attend class.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#62:1>
At the same time she pulled in, another car would arrive, and a young
man would step out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#63:1>
As the semester wore on, they had become familiar strangers to one
another.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#64:1>
They smiled or sometimes exchanged greetings as they saw each other
arrive and leave. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#65:1>
One day he simply walked up to her and introduced himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#66:1>
He accompanied her as she headed for her class.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#67:1>
When the class ended, he was there waiting to walk with her back to
the parking lot.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#68:1>
This went on for two weeks before he asked her if he could take her
to lunch.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#69:1>
She agreed, and they took his car to a small <foreign> cafe
</foreign> not too far from school.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#70:1>
He hardly ate that first time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#71:1>
He was busy asking questions about her, and telling her whatever came
to mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#72:1>
They went to lunch together a few more times after that.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#73:1>
They exchanged stories and looked for things they had in common. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#74:1>
He was one of the growing numbers of Filipinos whose families,
like hers, no longer lived happily under one roof.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#75:1>
But unlike her, he stayed with neither parent.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#76:1>
His mother and father each had families of their own now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#77:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'm the thing they have in common, &rdquo;
</quote> he told her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#78:1>
He was the lucky recipient of their separate versions of
generosity.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#79:1>
A car.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#80:1>
The house in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#81:1>
A constant arrival of <indig> 'padala' </indig> that reached him
through <indig> balikbayan </indig> friends of his parents: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#82:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Hello, I 'm so-and-so, a friend of your mother 's.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#83:1>
She heard I was coming to Manila so she asked me to bring you this.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#84:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I 'm your dad 's business partner up in
Vancouver.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#85:1>
I have a letter and a check for you from him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#86:1>
Could you come over and pick it up? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#87:1>
He said he sometimes wondered if they drew lots to decide whose
turn it was to send him something.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#88:1>
Maybe they had a schedule worked out in advance to make sure their
son received a phone call from either of them regularly.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#89:1>
They checked up on him, often enough.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#90:1>
He would reassure them that he was all right.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#91:1>
The house had not burned down, and the car still looked brand new.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#92:1>
School was fine, and his part-time job with a family friend was okey
too.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#93:1>
He would be graduating soon, and when he did, he would pay more bills
at home.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#94:1>
He had got a dog, it was house-broken now, and no, he didn't want to
join either of them, but thanks for asking again anyway.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#95:1>
He enjoyed his pseudo-independent lifestyle in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#96:1>
Sort of. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#97:1>
He no longer maintained ties with relatives, either.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#98:1>
She wondered what it felt like, spending Christmas and other holidays
at friends ' parties, or as an anonymous reveller in some crowded bar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#99:1>
SHE told her mother she felt sorry for him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#100:1>
Her mother said she was sorry too.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#101:1>
Her tone was the same one she used whenever she commented on street
children, pregnant teenage actresses, or animals that had been run over in
the South Expressway.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#102:1>
It was the tone reserved for situations brought about by other
people 's lack of responsibility. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#103:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Your new friend however, &rdquo; </quote> she
told her daughter, <quote> &ldquo; isn't the victim he might appear to be.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#104:1>
She remarked on the ungrateful way he talked about his parents.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#105:1>
And wasn't he a bit too forward, she added.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#106:1>
She was disturbed by the casual way they met, and more so by the
apparent haste with which Gina went with him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#107:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What would people say?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#108:1>
She waited for her mother to continue.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#109:1>
She was somehow relieved when the older woman just stood up without
saying anything else. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#110:1>
GINA continued to see him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#111:1>
She looked forward to their lunches, and he had already started
calling her at home.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#112:1>
One day, he came to visit.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#113:1>
She introduced him to her mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#114:1>
She was very polite to him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#115:1>
After he left, mother and daughter sat down to dinner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#116:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I thought you weren't seeing him anymore,
&rdquo; </quote> her mother said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#117:1>
She sat there, thinking of a reply.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#118:1>
She was looking for something to say, like <quote> &ldquo; I thought
you knew. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#119:1>
Or maybe <quote> &ldquo; I enjoy his company. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#120:1>
Anything. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#121:1>
Her mother spoke again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#122:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Daughters are precious things.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#123:1>
Beautiful and fragile, like glass.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#124:1>
I did not take such pains to raise you only to have you end up with
someone like him. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#125:1>
Her daughter could say nothing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#126:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It would be good for you to distance yourself
from him. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#127:1>
He was never brought up in conversation again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#128:1>
WHEN her mother found out that she was still seeing him even
after that night, she did not express anger or disappointment.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#129:1>
She simply stopped talking to her daughter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#130:1>
Gina had simply been removed from view. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#131:1>
The distance and coldness which she had dreaded as a child had
returned.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#132:1>
She panicked.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#133:1>
At the parking lot the next day, she spoke to him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#134:1>
She would not see him again, she told him, and he asked why.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#135:1>
Was it something he said, or did?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#136:1>
She had difficulty explaining.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#137:1>
Out came a jumble of reasons, all of which had to do with her
mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#138:1>
He listened, and said he understood.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#139:1>
And then, almost as an afterthought, he asked, <quote> &ldquo; But
what do you want? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#140:1>
She was thrown by the question.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#141:1>
What did she want? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#142:1>
She thought of her mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#143:1>
She remembered all the stories she had been told.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#144:1>
The importance of gratitude, and obedience.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#145:1>
She remembered how she watched for a change of expression in her
mother 's face whenever she did something that pleased her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#146:1>
Hoping, waiting for a smile, some reassurance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#147:1>
All her life she had tiptoed around her mother, raw with
anticipation for her moment when she would be seen and held.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#148:1>
She never asked, only waited. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#149:1>
There wasn't anything she wanted that was separate from her
mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#150:1>
Or was there?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#151:1>
They stood there, quiet.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#152:1>
He seemed sadder when he asked her again.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#153:1>
<quote> &ldquo; What do you want? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#154:1>
Because there wasn't anything else, she said, <quote> &ldquo; I
want what my mother wants, &rdquo; </quote> and walked away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#155:1>
SHE found out through friends that he left for the States after
graduation.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#156:1>
He had long ago been petitioned by his mother, and everyone
concluded that he was just waiting for the right time to leave.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#157:1>
She only wished she had been able to say goodbye, or good luck.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#158:1>
Or maybe that she was sorry.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#159:1>
Anything. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#160:1>
It took a while, but she was able to return to the routine she
had with her mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#161:1>
There was a lot of relief in that, and she pointed this out to
herself whenever she wondered about him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#162:1>
SHE was still telling herself that as she went to her room to
read his letter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#163:1>
He wrote to say that he had gotten settled ( whatever that
means), and was putting together a new existence too far removed from
everything he knew.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#164:1>
That, and a few other details about his new job, the apartment he
was renting, the American friends with whom he would go out to Greenwich
Village on weekends. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#165:1>
She thought it sounded like a form letter--something you could
make copies of and send to every relative back home.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#166:1>
Except of course there was no one of the sort he would write home
to.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#167:1>
She knew that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#168:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You 're the first person I 've written to since
I left, &rdquo; </quote> he said as if he read her thoughts.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#169:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't know if you believe me, but you are the
closest thing to family I had in Manila. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#170:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You were also the reason I had to finally leave.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#171:1>
He said that after her it had suddenly become unbearable being
alone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#172:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Being around you made me want things.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#173:1>
Real things, like family.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#174:1>
Someone to come home to.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#175:1>
When you told me how it was going to be that day in the parking lot,
I came to realize that there was nothing for me in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#176:1>
So I left. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#177:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I often think back to the last time I saw you.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#178:1>
Whether it was real of imagined on my part, you seemed unhappy about
the decision you made.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#179:1>
As if it wasn't really yours. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#180:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Not to say that if you had it your way you would
choose me, but perhaps there was something else you wanted? &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#181:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Is it fair that I am telling you all this now,
when so much time has passed?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#182:1>
Or would it make a difference at all?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#183:1>
For whatever it 's worth, I do miss you, and will write again soon.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#184:1>
Carefully she folded up his letter and put it back into its
envelope.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#185:1>
She thought of her mother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#186:1>
She imagined how, one day while she was in school another one of
those Jersey letters would arrive.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#187:1>
Her mother would say she didn't notice that the letter wasn't
addressed to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#188:1>
Or that it was out of concern that she had read it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#189:1>
Or simply that it was her privilege and right as a loving mother.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#190:1>
Through whatever way, she would one day find out that the
letters were coming from him.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#191:1>
There would be no chances for questions or explanations.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#192:1>
Her daughter would simply disappear again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#193:1>
Gina stood up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#194:1>
She moved to her desk, took out a sheet of paper and a pen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#195:1>
How odd it is, she thought, to be writing someone to ask him not to
write again.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#196:1>
She wrote hurriedly, but already, something he said was echoing in
her head: <quote> &ldquo; Perhaps there was something else you wanted?
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#197:1>
And then her mother 's words: <quote> &ldquo; Daughters are
precious things.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#198:1>
Beautiful and fragile, like glass. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#199:1>
Gina stopped writing.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#200:1>
All of a sudden she was painfully aware of how her mother saw her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#201:1>
Made of glass, clear and smooth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#202:1>
Something that could be seen right through, that would become
anything it was molded into. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#203:1>
Her mother 's image of her was clear now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#204:1>
Her daughter was not flesh and blood, or heart, or head.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#205:1>
She was not warm or soft to touch. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#206:1>
She was fragile glass that could not possibly survive on its
own.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#207:1>
Glass that could not possibly touch anything the way she knew she
had already touched him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#208:1>
It was then that she asked herself, <quote> &ldquo; What do you
want? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-008#209:1>
She took the letter she was writing, and slowly tore it to
shreds. </p> </I>
