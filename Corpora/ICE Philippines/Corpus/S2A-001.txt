 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#1:1:A>
<&> not beginning of broadcast </&> Trade and commerce industry communications banking education for the southern part of the Philippines and uh the need to establish Malaca&ntilde;ang here has been the dream of the Cebuanos for such a long time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#2:1:A>
That 's one of the reasons why the Cebuanos have been clamoring for a Cebuano President <indig> 'no </indig> so that we can have a Malaca&ntilde;ang here in Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#3:1:A>
You 'd be surprised how many people fly to Manila just to get some sort of government approval
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#4:1:A>
And uh many of these activities are really unnecessary except to help subsidize uh Philippine Airlines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#5:1:A>
Uhm the presence of a uh uhm Malaca&ntilde;ang uh in the Visayas uh would bring the President closer to the people and this is something that is truly meaningful to all of us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#6:1:A>
We 're very very appreciative for this event
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#7:1:A>
At this point uh it 's hard to say how it will really benefit us but it has it 's never been tried before
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#8:1:A>
But most definitely uh we are very elated with this development and uh this is a step in the right direction

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#9:1:B>
A step in the right direction indeed and uh that sense of optimism by Mayor Osme&ntilde;a is one vision being shared not only by the Cebuanos but by our people here in the Visayan region especially when we talk about areas like uh eastern Visayas and even parts of western Visayas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#10:1:B>
These areas in the past although the past administrations have tried their very best to ensure that uh development in these areas will come somehow the process has been very slow
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#11:1:B>
I think the momentum can be carried out toward the President ensuring that uh with the creation of the Cebu of the South will be an extension
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#12:1:B>
Now just looking at it here from Cebu uh what and uh maybe you 've heard about the problems in other areas of uh the Visayas what do you think should be one of the main agenda which uhm the people who are designated with the task should look at as uh priority areas

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#13:1:C>
Uhm I think the the people now here in Cebu are quite having problems as regards energy and water and I think the people are complaining about the system the electricity and the water
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#14:1:C>
And I think it 's a good thing that there is uh an established uhm <.> e </.> extension Office of the President here in Cebu so that whatever problems the people might have they can easily go there to the office and not fly to Manila to give their complaints or whatever

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#15:1:B>
Okay very good points established by you uh William
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#16:1:B>
You know one main element which the President mentioned last week when he went to Davao to induct into office Paul Enriquez who will be heading the Mindanao I mean the presidential office in Davao City is coming out with a master plan of development for the whole of Mindanao
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#17:1:B>
Cebu over the past uh six years under the Aquino administration has experienced an economic boom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#18:1:B>
That 's why you talk about Ceboom and about only to be stopped uh I think by <{> <[> typhoon Ping </[> when you had a lot of destruction

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#19:1:C>
<[> Typhoon Ping </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#20:1:B>
How much Sir was that worth in terms of destruction

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#21:1:C>
I mean it uh tore the whole province down but then due to the the driving enthusiasm of the Cebuanos and their creativity their resourcefulness the province just rose from the ground and then as you can see there 's a lot of physical evidences uhm as regards the boom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#22:1:C>
We have uh construction boom uh tourism has quite expanded a lot
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#23:1:C>
<{> <[> And </[> it 's very encouraging to know that President Ramos has set his sights on Cebu and the rest of the region also

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#24:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#25:1:B>
Well Cebu over the past uh uh six years under the Aquino uh administration has been experiencing very good growth rates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#26:1:B>
G N P I think averaged between even higher than the national average of something like four percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#27:1:B>
And uh in terms of uh export earnings they have reached something like one or two hundred fifty million uh only last year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#28:1:B>
Uh tourism also a very good potential for development here in Cebu and the Visayas raked in about one hundred fifty-five million dollars in terms of the economy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#29:1:B>
Now at this time uh we would like to play back for you uh a the visit of the President President Fidel Ramos at the semiconductor plant uh right after touching down here in Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#30:1:B>
There you see the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#31:1:B>
Of course the semiconductor plant is just one of several companies that are located in the <{> <[> Mactan Export Processing </[> Zone and this has provided so many jobs and one of the campaign promises of the President which he is now trying to attack is unemployment

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#32:1:C>
<[> In Mactan yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#33:1:C>
Uh uhm that 's one problem that we should address
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#34:1:C>
It 's always possible

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#35:1:B>
But uh if you try to look at the unemployment uh rate here in Cebu compared on a national level or even uh in other parts of the region the rate of unemployment is not as high
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#36:1:B>
Something like uh uh eighteen well seventeen percent uh other areas especially <.> depre </.> depressed areas they can go as high as twenty-five percent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#37:1:B>
There the President now

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#38:1:C>
What is he wearing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#39:1:B>
Well in this area because semiconductor you talk about chips uh for computers which are essential in coming out with the manufacture of computers and high tech uh systems uh so the President is being <.> gi </.> given a briefing now exactly how the entire operation of semiconductors goes on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#40:1:B>
The President uh uh has made this uh a part of his working visit to ensure that he goes to several areas uh where he considers the element of uh employment is very important
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#41:1:B>
Uh I was talking to they say

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#42:1:C>
Is this <.> duri </.> after they 've given him honors <{> <[> <,> </[> there in the Mactan Cebu International Airport

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#43:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#45:1:B>
I was talking earlier to the Trade Secretary uh Rizalino Navarro
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#46:1:B>
Now right now the present area of the Mactan Export Processing Zone is about one hundred twenty hectares talking about fifty-five companies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#47:1:B>
But the Trade Department is envisioning a total of uh more companies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#48:1:B>
They 're bringing in sixty so they need additional one hundred forty hectares
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#49:1:B>
How would you talk about the space here in Cebu <{> <[> for business </[> for investments

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#50:1:C>
<[> I mean </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#51:1:C>
Well there is uhm quite a lot I mean big a large amount of land which can be utilized as uhm business uhm to be used for business firms
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#52:1:C>
They can also have uh construct their building complexes for the improvement of tourism in Cebu

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#53:1:B>
Tourism in Cebu a major prospect for development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#54:1:B>
And Cebu is can be a staging point to that 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#> they will let tourist destinations uhm that will all develop tourist destinations to other part of <.> Met </.> of the the Visayas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#55:1:B>
Now the benefits for the uh establishment of the Visayas uh here in Cebu of the Malaca&ntilde;ang here in the Visayas here specifically in Cebu is it becomes an extension arm for other regions in the country uh other provinces in the Visayas uh like Region six for western Visayas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#56:1:B>
You have the provinces of Aklan Antique Capiz Iloilo Negros Occidental
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#57:1:B>
In uh Region eight this is one area that has been bothered so much by the insurgency but the peace and order situation has improved over the past five years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#58:1:B>
And peace and order and political stability is one of the main agenda of the President during the first one hundred days
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#59:1:B>
And the province to be covered uh in terms of linking up with the Palace through the Cebu office uh Leyte Northern Samar Eastern Samar Western Samar and Biliran
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#60:1:B>
Now for central Visayas of course Cebu main focal point for you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#62:1:B>
You must be very happy Bohol Negros Occidental <{> <[> and Siquijor </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#63:1:C>
<[> Yeah and Siquijor </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#64:1:B>
Yes these are around central Visayas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#65:1:B>
Which parts have you gone to which you think would be given uh top priority uh William

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#66:1:C>
Well I 've never been out of Cebu neither in Bohol Negros Occidental or Siquijor but I have lots of friends coming from Bohol and they have more or less the same complaint
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#67:1:C>
They don't have potable water
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#68:1:C>
They they have poor electrical system and also there in Negros I mean

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#69:1:B>
Negros well

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#70:1:C>
Negros business that is quite bad or

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#71:1:B>
Well

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#72:1:C>
Compared to Negros <.> Ori </.> Occidental <unclear> word </unclear> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#73:1:B>
Negros Oriental is one of the provinces which is going to be given top priority
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#74:1:B>
It 's just very close to Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#75:1:B>
One of the major problems that has some uh that has always uh prevented the economic development in areas like Region eight like you talk about Leyte Samar has been the insurgency but this has been one problem that has been addressed very well
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#76:1:B>
And the uh reconciliation efforts of the President hopefully an amnesty program will be there for our rebel brothers from the communist rebels will be a very important element in ensuring that the peace and order situation in these areas will improve
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#77:1:B>
Power development is going to be one of the key factors which are considered necessary in the development of uh Leyte
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#78:1:B>
Leyte already host to a major geothermal plant
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#79:1:B>
Now at this time Eli if you 're ready with uh some reports let 's have you <,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#80:1:D>
As we told you earlier the President took a helicopter from Mactan Airbase to the Visayas Command which is the headquarters of VisCom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#81:1:D>
And then he was joined and welcomed by uh the veterans the uh Commander of the Visayas Command <,> and the uh P N P Chief uh Mr Roger Dumila <,> and a uh meeting with the veterans the council of elders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#82:1:D>
They were discussing a lot of things to the welfare of the uh veterans among which of course is or regards the pensions of the veterans and this the President promised to look into at the uh instance of meeting the leaders of the uh veterans council
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#83:1:D>
There you have uh Joel Arnazo leading the President who used to be the uh commander here also at VisCom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#84:1:D>
This is a sentimental journey for the President because way back in nineteen seventy-one it was here when he was with the Philippine Army <?> twelfth </?> infantry brigade where the President earned his first star here at Camp Lapu-Lapu so that this place will always be a part of his memory
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#85:1:D>
The President <,> had a briefing also on the peace and order situation from the P N P Chief
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#86:1:D>
And uh we 'll tell you more about the other activities this morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#87:1:D>
For the moment we turn you over to Freddie and William

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#88:1:B>
Thank you very much Eli for that report uh with the uh meeting with the top military commanders in the area led by General Zulueta who was only promoted last uh Friday at the Palace
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#89:1:B>
I had an opportunity to talk with him
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#90:1:B>
Countryside development one area in the past administrations which was well not with the Aquino administration I guess this has been given top priority is the area in Samar and we 're very happy to have with us one of the governors Governor Bravo who was has been doing a very great job to ensure that development in that area will come with insurgency hopefully not a problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#92:1:B>
Governor it 's a pleasure to have you again
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#93:1:B>
You must have a vision of uh I mean you must be very happy that the President uh is showing more concern now for the south and you are you have the Malaca&ntilde;ang of the south here in the Visayas in Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#94:1:B>
How do you expect this to work in terms of forging a better and working relationship with uh the President

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#95:1:E>
Yes first uh Fred uh we 're very much uh gratified that uh there 's going to be a Malaca&ntilde;ang in the south uh particularly in Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#96:1:E>
I think this is the first right step uh because uh here you 're getting to know one another and you are reaching out okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#97:1:E>
That 's the first stage of development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#98:1:E>
You cannot develop uh people uh unless and until uh you know their leaders
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#99:1:E>
In uh Region eight where I come which uh comprises uh these the provinces of Samar and Leyte we are still in that uh stage where we want the basic uh needs for our people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#100:1:E>
Basic in the sense that uh while uh other countries would have reached that uh so-called <unclear> word </unclear> uh newly-industrialized countries here in the Philippines and particularly Region eight uh we still want uh power uh infrastructure countryside development uh and uh we would like to stamp out the problem of insurgency via these uh livelihood projects uh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#101:1:C>
On the line let me ask the Governor <,> <.> ho </.> how can this uh extension Office of <.> th </.> President be of help to your province as a Governor

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#102:1:E>
Number one uh Cebu is a little bit uh nearer to Samar and Leyte and which means that uh it is uh less expensive uh in going to Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#103:1:E>
And uh besides uh we 're talking uh of decentralization and local autonomy and that is now uh the idea which uh whose time has come 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#> Uh with Eric Pelaez we do not have to be going to the bureaucratic uh debilitating system of governance in what you call the imperial uh city of Manila which is after all has many problems of brown-outs of garbage of traffic and pollution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#104:1:E>
Uh anyway we are helping the nation by having Malaca&ntilde;ang in the south so that we can decongest uh certain areas in Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#105:1:E>
Did you know that for example uh the uh Smokey Mountain in Tondo would uh really uh uh be solved uh if we really decentralized because most of the population in the Smokey Mountain uh comes from Samar Leyte
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#106:1:E>
So instead of uh you know uh going to Manila every now and then in the process uh sustaining that policy of mendicancy and dependency where we have to beg for financial aid for approval of feasibility study for giving the go ahead signal towards uh uh programs of worth all we have to do is refer it to Pelaez uh come now to uh the very nice pleasant pleasing uh hospitable city of Cebu where uh we can get things done and get results uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#108:1:B>
Thank you Governor for joining us and good luck and hopefully all the support that you wanted will be coming from the Palace

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#109:1:E>
Thank you very much uh Fred and thank you <{> <[> for having me </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#110:1:C>
<[> Will </[> </{> when you come back to Eastern Samar you can spread the good news to those people

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#111:1:E>
I hope uh we have uh one like this in uh Eastern Samar
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#112:1:E>
I hope uh if this is via satellite we can be reached in Borongan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#113:1:E>
Thank you very much

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#114:1:B>
Thank you Governor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#115:1:B>
Governor uh Bravo of uh the Province of Eastern Samar one area which is has been bothered by the insurgency problem but the peace and order situation has gradually improved over the years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#117:1:B>
And hopefully with a very sincere effort with the President and with the support of both houses of Congress to come up with an amnesty program for the rebels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#118:1:B>
And hopefully there will be a very good chance that this twenty-year insurgency will be finally resolved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#119:1:B>
And this time Eli how are you <,,> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#120:1:D>
The sentimental journey of President Ramos to Camp Lapu-Lapu where he earned his first star was highlighted by two events
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#121:1:D>
This was the dialogue with the uh veterans but before that there was a closed door conference for the military officers with General Romeo Zulueta of the Visayas Command and the Chief of the uh P N P General Roger Dumila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#122:1:D>
These two officers namely General Zulueta and General Dumila are no strangers to the area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#123:1:D>
As we know General Dumila has just presently returned to Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#124:1:D>
This was also joined by some of the members of the First Family
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#125:1:D>
We uh have here the Secretary the Executive Secretary Peter Garrucho we have the uh D I L G Secretary Raffy Alunan and the other dignitaries who joined the President in this meeting with the officers of the VisCom
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#126:1:D>
The President was given a uh comprehensive picture as to the peace and order situation obtaining in the area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#127:1:D>
And uh there you have General Dumila who gave the briefing to the President on the peace and order situation in the Visayas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#128:1:D>
We also have here the uh the Chief of the of the uh Secretary of the Department of National Defense Secretary Renato de Villa
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#129:1:D>
And we will have more of the activities that are taking place here in Cebu with the visit of the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#130:1:D>
For the moment we turn you over to Freddie and William

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#131:1:B>
Thank you very much uh Eli for that report at Camp Lapu-Lapu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#> The President meeting with top commanders in the area being joined by Defense Secretary uh Renato de Villa and uh Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan together with Press Secretary <.> Ro </.> Rod Reyes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#132:1:B>
Of course when you talk about seeing Secretary Alunan one of the the things that comes into your mind is uh the Local Government Code but at the same time the war against crime 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#> He 's working very closely with the uh Chief of the Presidential <.> Anti- </.> Commission on Anti-Crime and the perhaps one of the major action programs which the President wants addressed during his first one hundred days is the war against crime and this has been very successful during the past two weeks since its launching with Erap Estrada right there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#133:1:B>
And hopefully the momentum being carried out in uh in the Luzon area will be carried out here in the Visayas and even Mindanao
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#134:1:B>
Now William

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#135:1:C>
As usual uh the First Lady will have the <unclear> 1 word </unclear> activities this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#136:1:C>
Uh she will visit Maytabal Rattan Exporting Company and right after that she will visit the Street Children Center at Parian for a short program
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#137:1:C>
And I think uh the First Lady herself has a lot of things in her itinerary

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#138:1:B>
Well the First Lady also a very active uh person and uh one of her top priority
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#139:1:B>
Well she has been designated as somebody who should be in charge of beautification but prior to the President 's oath-taking <.> a </.> I was talking to the First Lady and one of her top priorities is to plant more trees and reforestation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#140:1:B>
And one of the main agenda of the Ramos government is sustainable development but at the same time ensuring environmental protection
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#142:1:B>
To ensure that the environment we have will not dissipate even if development will come
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#143:1:B>
Joining us at the stage is the Governor of a very small island but I <.> gue </.> I guess very beautiful twice Governor Ben Aquino of Siquijor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#144:1:B>
Governor uh welcome to our coverage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#145:1:B>
You must be very happy that you have <indig> itong tinatawag nating </indig> Malaca&ntilde;ang of the South <indig> dito sa </indig> Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#146:1:B>
How does this help you in a way considering that in the past uh some of the attention is not coming out

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#147:1:F>
Uhm not exactly 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#> If uh government in this project of uh Malaca&ntilde;ang in the South if government has to to appropriate uh funds for the purpose I feel that it is not necessary
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#148:1:F>
We have the different regional offices of the different agencies
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#149:1:F>
We have the governors who could uh directly go to Malaca&ntilde;ang uh for anything that uh would need uh the attention from the President probably
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#150:1:F>
I guess we will have uh a monthly conference with the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#151:1:F>
So as I said if uh government has to to appropriate additional funds for this purpose I think it 's not necessary

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-001#152:1:B>
Well anyway just looking at uh discussing regional concerns that can be worked out together among the provinces to ensure that development can be very balanced 

 </I>
