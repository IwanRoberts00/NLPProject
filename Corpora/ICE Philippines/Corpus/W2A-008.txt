<h> <bold> Ecological Concerns in a Modern Presentation of the Mystery
of Creation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#3:1>
Concern for ecology is one of the signs of our times.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#4:1>
Man, through scientific and technological progress, has rendered
himself capable of transforming his habitat to a degree hitherto
unimaginable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#5:1>
He has become, not just one more species inhabiting the earth, but
rather one that consciously and decisively determines the planet 's fate (
for good or bad).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#6:1>
The perception of the magnitude and depth of impact on the world has
led man to appreciate more keenly his relatedness to nature, and to become
wary of his cumulative effect upon it.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#7:1>
That, essentially, is what ecological concern is all about. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#8:1>
This concern, though having its origin in highly industrialized
nations, has reached other areas of the globe as well, particularly those
countries which, like the Philippines, have a plethora of natural resources
in danger of depletion.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#9:1>
It is not surprising that the Second Plenary Council of the
Philippines [ PCP-II] should include a section on ecology in its final <it>
Decree </it> , stating: <quote> &ldquo; The Church, through the initiatives
of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines [ CBCP], should develop
a comprehensive theology of stewardship and, in the light of this theology,
should make ecology a special concern of the social action apostolate down to
the parochial level, with the end in view of making everyone a true steward
of God 's creation. &rdquo; </quote> <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#10:1>
In these brief but pithy lines the PCP II maps out not just a
course of pastoral action, but also a trajectory for theological reflection.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#11:1>
Indeed, effective solutions to the ecological problem may be achieved
only if the question is analyzed down to its deepest roots.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#12:1>
That means taking into account a number of facts about the cosmos,
man, and history, which are told us by Revelation: particularly, the divine
origin of man and the world; the specific role of man in the universe; and
the historical facts of sin and redemption.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#13:1>
Only when these truths are taken into account may a comprehensive
answer to the ecological problem be formulated.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#14:1>
The solution cannot consist in a purely technological measure; it
will, as we shall see, necessarily imply a moral effort. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#15:1>
It is the purpose of the present article, following the idea of
PCP II, to suggest a basic theological framework for reflection on the
ecological issue.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#16:1>
A suitable context for such reflection, we believe, is offered by the
Christian doctrine on creation. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#17:1>
<h> <bold> A Christian View of Nature </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#18:1>
<X> <quote> In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth. </quote> </X> <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#19:1>
This rotund, opening affirmation of the Bible immediately situates
the world, together with man, within a fundamental theological context, which
the sacred books will describe with progressive richness.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#20:1>
Scripture decidedly declares the creatural, contingent character of
all finite being: everything that exists outside of God has been drawn by Him
from absolute nothingness, through a divine act of wisdom, power and
goodness.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#21:1>
This vision of the world 's origin is far removed from other,
non-Christian views which, awed by the cosmic mystery, assign to the universe
a divine nature: this &ldquo; All &rdquo; must be God himself, they think (
pantheism); or is an effusion of the divine substance ( emanatism); in any
case, to the whole or its parts religious veneration and cult are due.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#22:1>
( Elements of this cosmic-religious tendency survive even in our day
in the New Age Movement, in which - - as Pope John Paul II reminded U.S.
Bishops in a 1993 discourse - - the idea of personal responsibility before
God is displaced by vague sense of duty towards the cosmos <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp>
</fnr> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#23:1>
The revealed datum de-divinizes and de-mythologizes the universe, by
uncovering, underneath its impressive vastness and apparent solidity, an
original, yawning abyss of &ldquo; nothingness. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#24:1>
At the same time, revelation tells man that he cannot despise the
world.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#25:1>
He should, in fact, adopt an attitude of wonder before the handiwork
of God.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#26:1>
The disposition of reverent contemplation is expressed in Psalms like
18, 103, and 148, and has been deeply felt by Christians such as St. Francis
of Assisi and St. Philip Neri.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#27:1>
This attitude implies a special type of wonder and awe, for it does
not imply subjugation to a &ldquo; deified &rdquo; cosmos but rather loving
respect towards a Creator 's masterpiece. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#28:1>
<X> <quote> God saw all the things that he made, and they were
very good. </quote> </X> <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#29:1>
The human being, before a universe filled with marvellous laws,
cannot but feel himself inclined to share in this first, primordial, positive
glance of creation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#30:1>
He is led to value his world as one gifted with consistency and
meaning, and consequently as a reality worthy of respect and study. <sp> 5
</sp>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#31:1>
He cannot simply reject the created universe as an enemy or obstacle
in his search for God ( as some excessively &ldquo; spiritualistic &rdquo;
minds might think), nor as something wholly devoid of interest; on the
contrary: the cosmos, with its myriad vestiges of a Maker, validly appears as
a place of possible encounter with God. <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#32:1>
The Christian faith sees through the cosmos, to a transcendent
Being, to which all creation is linked by causal bonds of power,
intelligence, and love.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#33:1>
Such a view is far removed from the secularized visions of the
universe, which conceive it as some sort of rootless and drifting &ldquo;
orphan", a thing without origin, course, or destiny.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#34:1>
It may be eternal, some way - - but belongs to no One ...

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#35:1>
Perhaps it did begin in time, with a bang ( or oscillates eternally
between the states of nothingness and somethingness) - - but has no Author
nor Cause...

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#36:1>
In any case, a desolate picture. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#37:1>
<h> <bold> Man 's Role in the Universe </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#38:1>
The human being, an integral part of the universe, is a creature,
too, and shares the experience of fragility with the rest of beings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#39:1>
Revelation, however, tells him that he holds a special place within
the whole, and that he must fulfill a specific function in the universe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#40:1>
The first chapter of Genesis narrates a progressive sequence
wherein creatures appear in &ldquo; ascending &rdquo; order.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#41:1>
Man 's apparition is situated in the last ( sixth) day of the
creation account, and is portrayed as the climactic moment of the sequence.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#42:1>
The human being is created by God according to His &ldquo; image and
likeness, &rdquo; <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr> and receives this mandate: <X>
<quote> &ldquo; Increase and multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. &rdquo;
</quote> </X> <fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#43:1>
The creation of man thus appears in continuity with that of the
rest of creatures; but this peculiar creation account indicates that the
human being cannot be considered as simply and wholly &ldquo; homogeneous
&rdquo; with the rest of creation. <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#44:1>
He, and only he ( a &ldquo; person"), enjoys special reference to the
Maker.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#45:1>
This perspective differentiates the Christian faith from other
anthropological conceptions, which count man as simply one more animal ( more
developed, certainly); or which reclaim animal rights equal to ( or even
greater than) those of men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#46:1>
The narrative of the creation of man and woman in the second
chapter of Genesis likewise contains an indication of the human being 's
privileged place and role within creation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#47:1>
It states that Yahweh <quote> put man into the paradise of pleasure,
to dress it, and to keep it, </quote> <fnr> <sp> 10 </sp> </fnr> and that He
presented all the animals to man <quote> to see what he would call them.
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#48:1>
This double biblical expression of man 's unique grasp and control of
the reality that surrounds him indicates that the Creator has bestowed upon
man an ontological and functional superiority over all creatures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#49:1>
Now, the dominion that God expects man to exercise over the
universe is of a specific kind, which has been felicitously defined as a
<mention> &ldquo; stewardship &rdquo; </mention> : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#50:1>
1) It does not mean absolute dominion, since man is not the
radical Source of things.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#51:1>
He must consider the world as a gift, entrusted by God to his care.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#52:1>
He is under obligation to employ that gift correctly, in accord with
the Giver 's will.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#53:1>
Thus man, created according to the divine likeness, should act as God 's
representative.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#54:1>
He cannot dispose of creation in an irresponsible, arbitrary, or
despotic manner ( for example by unleashing effects so deleterious upon the
environment as the massive release of toxic wastes, or the wanton
exploitation of irreplaceable natural resources). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#55:1>
2) Man 's dominion over created beings cannot constitute a wholly
autonomous activity, &ldquo; subtracted &rdquo; from God 's sphere ( as
deists and philosophers of the Enlightenment might suggest).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#56:1>
Neither man nor world may be conceived in absolute independence from
the Maker.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#57:1>
( God himself does not forget about his handiwork, but rather
constantly unfolds his loving designs for creatures ' bliss).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#58:1>
The practical consequence of this is plain: man 's action upon nature
must assume the forms of subordination to God 's design and cooperation with
His creative action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#59:1>
3) Dominion and power over the rest of creatures may be
conceived, besides, from the perspective of man as <quote> &ldquo; priest of
all creation." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 22 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#60:1>
The material universe achieves its culmination in the human being,
and through him finds a voice to praise its Creator freely. <fnr> <sp> 13
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#61:1>
Man has the mission of so ordering nature that it may fulfill its
primordial function of manifesting the divine perfection.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#62:1>
Incorporating the cosmos in his own adoration and praise, man
elevates it above itself and lets the universe render God a glory which,
alone, it cannot give. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#63:1>
It becomes clear from the foregoing exposition, that the
Christian doctrine on creation provides man with a basic orientation as to
the noble part he must play in the cosmos, and at the same time indicates
limits to his dominion over nature. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#64:1>
<h> <bold> Disruption of Sin; Restoration in Christ </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#65:1>
Revelation supplies one more relevant datum, namely sin 's entry
into human history.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#66:1>
Man, in breaking his friendship with God, has introduced a lack of
harmony, both within himself and in his relations with other creatures.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#67:1>
It is now difficult for him to handle creatures with total rectitude
of intention and respect for God 's plans.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#68:1>
The whole of creation, according to St. Paul, is subject to vanity,
and groans and travails in birth-pangs awaiting the manifestation of the
children of God. <sp> 14 </sp>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#69:1>
<X> <quote> If man is not at peace with God, neither will the world
itself be at peace. </quote> </X> <fnr> <sp> 15 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#70:1>
It does not require much effort to perceive the disorder which
man, through his moral deviations, has introduced into his environment:
destruction of natural habitats, disappearance of species, depletion of
forests, etc.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#71:1>
Behind such tragedies often lie selfish motives and disordered
interests, which give higher priority to economic or power gains, over the
good of persons or of nature; which prefer immediate personal profit to the
common good.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#72:1>
This realistic picture, of man as sinner, leads away from ingenuously
optimistic conceptions of man, such as J.J. Rousseau 's naturalism.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#73:1>
The Christian warns us that man in his historical situation suffers
the debilitating effects of sin, and cannot exercise his dominion within
himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#74:1>
Though he conserves his affinity for truth and good, he
simultaneously feels in his flesh the gravity-like pull of egoism, hedonism,
greed, which render arduous any moderate and reasonable behavior in using
earthly goods. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#75:1>
Christian revelation adds a final, hopeful datum, however, by
affirming that salvation has come to us through Christ.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#76:1>
It is possible to overcome sin and human frailty, and shape the world
in accordance with the divine project.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#77:1>
All things, in heaven and on earth, have been reconciled through
Christ, pacified with the blood of his Cross. <fnr> <sp> 16 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#78:1>
Christ has become the head of all <fnr> <sp> 17 </sp> </fnr> ; the
world, ruled previously by sin and death, has with Him begun the path towards
definitive renewal. <fnr> <sp> 18 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#79:1>
Time 's end will bring, not annihilation, but a renovation which will
yield <quote> &ldquo; a new heaven and a new earth" </quote> <fnr> <sp> 19
</sp> </fnr> - - a divine transformation of the world as we know it into a
fitting dwelling place for saints, resurrected and gathered complete around
Christ. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#80:1>
Within this eschatologically-charged picture, man 's actual
efforts to better the world and fashion it into a place worthy of human
dignity are relevant. <fnr> <sp> 20 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-008#81:1>
Humanity 's noble, hard-won gains in the actual stage of salvation
history will not be swept away in the end, but will rather be conserved,
purified, eternalized, at the final consummation. </p> </I>
