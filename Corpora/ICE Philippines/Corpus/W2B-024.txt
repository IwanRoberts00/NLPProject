<mention> Waterworld </mention> , a science fiction film depicting
a landless Earth after the polar ice caps shall have melted, may have more
basis in reality than people would care to think. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#2:1>
Scientists already have a term for the Waterworld scenario:
<mention> accelerated sea level rise, </mention> or ASLR.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#3:1>
And the culprit behind ASLR?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#4:1>
Climate change, in this case global warming, which is the result of
millions of years of gas and vapor emissions that form an insulating layer
around the earth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#5:1>
Scientists note that, in the course of a few generations,
emissions from industry, vehicles and other human activities have multiplied
more than 50 times, trapping heat in the atmosphere like a giant greenhouse.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#6:1>
The result is increased temperatures, more rain and ASLR - - all
physical changes that have serious economic and ecological consequences.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#7:1>
But the news gets worse: while developed countries are largely
responsible for such emissions, developing countries like the Philippines
will bear the brunt of the changes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#8:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Developing nations are expected to be hardest hit,
&rdquo; </quote> said Gregorio Estrada, technical director of the
Environmental Management of Protected Areas System of the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources in Region 7.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#9:1>
Estrada was among several speakers in a regional seminar-workshop on
climate change held in Cebu recently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#10:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The sea level has risen 10 to 20 centimeters
during the last decade; by 2100 it could be 65 cms higher than its level
today, &rdquo; </quote> Estrada said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#11:1>
He forecast such grim possibilities as flooded ports and communities.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#12:1>
The Philippines, whose coastline stretches 18,000 kilometers, is
very vulnerable to the rising sea levels, one of the most certain outcomes of
global warming, said Dr. Rosa Perez, a weather specialist of the Philippine
Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#13:1>
In her paper entitled <mention> &ldquo; Vulnerability Assessments
and Evaluation of Adaptations on Coastal Resources due to ASLR, &rdquo;
</mention> Perez wrote that once sea levels rise, low-lying areas would be
inundated, erosion would worsen, seawater would intrude into estuaries and
aquifers ( already starting in Cebu), and damage due to flooding and storms
would be greater. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#14:1>
Buildings along the coasts will be affected, and coastal
communities will have to find new sources of livelihood.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#15:1>
Coral reefs may also be destroyed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#16:1>
Certain species of wildlife may die out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#17:1>
Perez led a research team to study rising-sea scenarios in Manila
Bay from Cavite City in the south up to Metro Manila and in the north,
Hagonoy, Bulacan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#18:1>
The team indicated that the sea could rise to a low of 0.3 meters up
to a high of 2 meters by 2100. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#19:1>
All of Cavite, Perez predicted, will see a sea-level rise of at
least 30 centimeters.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#20:1>
With every meter that it rises, the sea goes at least three
kilometers inland, she said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#21:1>
The sea will literally rise to flood the plains. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#22:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Is the government ready? &rdquo; </quote> Perez
asked.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#23:1>
By the end of this century, the country will see <quote> &ldquo;
environmental refugees," </quote> she warned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#24:1>
Meanwhile, using simulations in climate change, a <indig> PAGASA
</indig> team has found that water supply from both Angat Dam in Luzon and
Lake Lanao in Mindanao would be at a serious deficit by 2050.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#25:1>
Nathaniel Cruz, <indig> PAGASA </indig> supervising weather
specialist, is studying the possible effects of sea-level rise on both water
sources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#26:1>
Angat Dam supplies most of the water requirements of Metro
Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#27:1>
It irrigates 28,000 hectares of farms, and generates an annual
electric energy of 529 Gwh for the Luzon grid.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#28:1>
Lake Lanao accounts for 90 percent of the total hydropower source of
Mindanao and serves domestic and irrigation water needs as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#29:1>
Although climate change has been one of the most studied
environmental problems since the late 1950s, most studies have made only
long-term projections, said Lando Velasco, technical adviser of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( 1992) and a member of the
Philippine Inter-Agency Committee on Climate Change. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#30:1>
Velasco said that Filipinos will actually start to suffer from
the effects of global warming and weather change in the next 50 years.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#31:1>
He said government must now make serious studies on the effects of
changing climate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#32:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Studies on agricultural productivity, for
example, do not factor in climate change and environmental degradation,
&rdquo; </quote> he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#33:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Government keeps pushing technology transfer, but
there are no studies on the impacts of such shifts to new technologies.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#34:1>
Meanwhile, the video documentary <mention> &ldquo; 2048--The
Greenhouse Effect &rdquo; </mention> warns that emissions of carbon dioxide,
which account for most greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, would be five
times what it is today if developing countries copied the energy habits of
rich countries.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#35:1>
About six billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions are deposited into
the atmosphere every year, according to another documentary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#36:1>
Both films were produced by the Television Trust for
Entertainment for the United Nations Environmental Program. </p>

<h> <bold> Ebola threat in the Philippines </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#39:2>
<bold> Monica Feria </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#40:2>
Science Fiction writer Stephen King described <mention> &ldquo;
The Hot Zone, &rdquo; </mention> a true-to-life account of the emergence of
the new killer virus Ebola, as one of the most horrifying things he has ever
read. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#41:2>
In this book, award-winning American author Richard Preston
described the gruesome debut of this lethal and highly-contagious organism in
Zaire and Sudan in 1976 and revealed a top secret military-civilian operation
in 1989 in response to the suspected entry of Ebola into a suburban town not
far from populous Washington D.C. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#42:2>
The virus that was to spark one of the worst biochemical scares
in U.S. history came from monkeys imported from an area halfway around the
globe from Africa--the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#43:2>
<mention> Ebola </mention> , named after a river in an area of
Central Africa where the first Ebola epidemic struck, is possibly the
deadliest virus to stalk the planet - - so far.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#44:2>
It attacks a host much like the way termites attack a wooden
house--chewing up internal organs until the body, reduced to a bag of mush
and bones, crashes and bleeds to death.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#45:2>
It is said that Ebola will do in 10 days what it will take the
AIDS-causing HIV virus 10 years to accomplish.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#46:2>
There is yet no known cure.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#47:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Compared to Ebola, AIDS is child 's play, &rdquo;
</quote> said one South African doctor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#48:2>
Under the microscope, the thread-like viral strain ( called a
filovirus) that was killing monkeys in 1989 at a holding facility in Reston,
Virginia, looked similar to the one that wiped out close to 600 people in
Zaire and Sudan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#49:2>
The facility was owned by a company named Hazleton Research
Products or HRP which was undertaking the importation and sale of laboratory
animals.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#50:2>
The monkey stock had come from Ferlite Scientific Research Inc., an
export company which had collected the animals from the forests of Zamboanga
on Mindanao Island, then raised and quarantined them in a facility in Laguna,
a province just south of Manila. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#51:2>
In Reston, narrates Preston, space suitclad army volunteers
quietly moved into the HRP facility, killed all the monkeys and &ldquo; nuked
it &rdquo; ( army slang for full decontamination operations). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#52:2>
The dramatic ending of Preston 's account is cause for global
relief: the Ebola strain in Reston was found to be not harmful to humans.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#53:2>
Four workers at the Virginia farm were infected but suffered only
minor symptoms and are alive up to today.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#54:2>
The new strain was named <mention> Ebola-Reston </mention> , to
distinguish it from Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan, and Marburg--the virus
discovered in a German holding farm in 1967 among monkeys imported from
Uganda. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#55:2>
But the Reston incident has raised some very disturbing
questions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#56:2>
Why is the Ebola virus bursting out into humankind only in recent
years?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#57:2>
Where did it come from?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#58:2>
Did the virus travel from Africa to the Philippines?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#59:2>
Or is it home-grown in southeast Asia?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#60:2>
Did the Zaire virus begin like the mild Ebola-Reston then mutate into
virulent form?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#61:2>
Up to now, reports Preston, the U.S. army medics have not downgraded
the status of Ebola-Reston from <mention> &ldquo; biolevel 4, &rdquo;
</mention> the category for highly dangerous organisms or hot agents.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#62:2>
( The HIV virus is classified <mention> &ldquo; biolevel 3. &rdquo;
</mention> ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#63:2>
Too little is known about Ebola virus and scientists warn against
letting down our guard.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#64:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Any virus that has the ability to change or mutate
theoretically has the possibility of becoming virulent--that is a concern,
&rdquo; </quote> stressed Gerald Stokes of George Washington University in
the CNN report.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#65:2>
Ebola-Reston, because of its observed ability to travel not just
through blood and mucus transfers but also through the air, may potentially
be the most dangerous of the filovirus sisters, others speculate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#66:2>
An increasing number of emerging or re-emerging viruses are
making their presence felt and not a few scientists believe that they will
square off with humankind in the 21st century.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#67:2>
In this sense, the more chilling part of <mention> &ldquo; The Hot
Zone &rdquo; </mention> may be its still unfolding postscript.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#68:2>
For example, what the U.S. and Philippine officials did to prevent
further infections after 1989: virtually nothing. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#69:2>
<h> <bold> EXPORT REQUIREMENTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#70:2>
Import-export requirements have not changed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#71:2>
Tests required on animals crossing national borders are set by the
importing countries.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#72:2>
Each country protects its own territory with import regulations and
quarantine procedures.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#73:2>
Among monkeys, tests are usually required for tuberculosis and yellow
fever.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#74:2>
Some international buyers require tests for salmonella and the
&ldquo; B &rdquo; virus or herpes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#75:2>
( This virus, by the way, is non-fatal among monkeys but can kill
humans if they are infected through bites or scratches.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#76:2>
No country, up to now, requires Ebola test clearances. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#77:2>
After the HRP monkey stock in Reston had been euthanized in
December of 1989, imports resumed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#78:2>
In March 1990, another Ebola-Reston epidemic hit the same holding
facility.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#79:2>
That same year, it is now being revealed, a Texas facility run by the
same company had an outbreak among its monkeys.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#80:2>
Again, in March this year, Ebola-Reston was discovered in the Alice,
Texas facility.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#81:2>
The monkeys were imported from the same source in the Philippines.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#82:2>
Businessman Alex Lina, who runs the Ferlite Farm in Laguna, said
officials from the U.S. Center for Disease Control ( CDC), the Naval Medical
Unit of the U.S. Armed Forces and many other foreign scientists visited his
farm after the 1989 outbreak in Reston.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#83:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We opened the facilities to them to do the testing
and whatever else they feel is necessary, &rdquo; </quote> he related to
<mention> <it> Graphic </it> </mention> in an interview.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#84:2>
Blood samples were taken of the monkeys and caretakers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#85:2>
After the researchers left, the Department of Health ordered him to
kill off his entire stock, then numbering about 800.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#86:2>
<quote> &ldquo; There was no epidemic raging in my farm at that time,
&rdquo; </quote> he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#87:2>
But he complied.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#88:2>
He cleaned out his farm and started again.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#89:2>
Exports resumed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#90:2>
Lina complains that he was never furnished a copy of the research
findings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#91:2>
In 1994, five full years after the Reston incident, the
government banned the export of wild monkeys.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#92:2>
Only those bred in captivity will be allowed out.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#93:2>
Exporters were assigned areas where they can collect monkeys to be
used only as breeders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#94:2>
With the most recent outbreak of Ebola-Reston infection in Texas
now reaching the press, the Philippines has banned temporarily all export of
monkeys.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#95:2>
There are six monkey exporting companies in the Philippines which
supply some 2,000-2,500 primates to laboratories abroad.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#96:2>
The ban was suggested by the country 's agricultural <foreign>
attache </foreign> in the U.S. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#97:2>
<h> <bold> VIRUS SURVEILLANCE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#98:2>
Surveillance and monitoring of the disease is virtually nil in
the Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#99:2>
In 1995, DOH finally released a circular ( signed by then Acting
Secretary Jaime Galvez-Tan) which announced what was already public knowledge
- - that <quote> &ldquo; Studies conducted by the Field Epidemiology Training
Program and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine of the Philippine
Department of Health, U.S. CDC and U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for
Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID) among monkeys and animal handlers in the
Philippines and U.S. showed that the Reston strain does not cause illness
among humans. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#100:2>
Apparently this referred to the 1989 study. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#101:2>
Did anyone figure out how an Ebola virus ended up in a monkey
from the Philippines?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#102:2>
Dr. Frederick A. Murphy, director of the U.S. Center for Infectious
Diseases at the time of the Reston incident and one of the world authorities
on viruses, told a reporter of <mention> Access Excellence </mention> that
<quote> &ldquo; It was not possible to do field studies in the Philippines
because of a civil war going on in the area [ Mindanao] the monkeys came
from. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#103:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We still have no idea where Ebola lives in
nature, &rdquo; </quote> he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#104:2>
There is no indication that Filipino researchers, whether from
the DOH or from those concerned with the animal industry, went to Mindanao
after the Americans left to pursue vital research in the interest of the
country 's own health and safety concerns.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#105:2>
A government committee reportedly met once or twice shortly after
the 1989 scare and concluded that Ebola <quote> &ldquo; was not of public
health importance. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#106:2>
Other sources said lack of foreign funds is the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#107:2>
The Philippines, as far as exporter Lina knows, still does not
have the technical capability to test animals for Ebola. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#108:2>
Veterinarian Arlene Vytiaco of the Bureau of Animal Industry (
BAI) confirmed this but she relayed the news that the U.S. CDC was now
willing to help the country acquire Ebola testing kits or at least set up
links so blood samples can be sent to the U. S. for testing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#109:2>
And finally, after seven years, the government formally created
this April a <quote> &ldquo; multi-sectoral, filovirus study group, &rdquo;
</quote> composed of experts from the DOH, DENR and DA.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#110:2>
The whole world is still largely in the dark about Ebola, said
Vytiaco, who will be part of the new study group.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#111:2>
But she agreed that vigilance is necessary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#112:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The worry is that the virus might mutate, we
must not relax, &rdquo; </quote> she said in a telephone interview. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#113:2>
A press release distributed by Ferlite cited a study in Japan 's
Tsukuba Primate Center for Medical Science, results of which were released
July last year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#114:2>
The study said that the non-virulent form of Ebola virus was also
found among monkeys from Indonesia and China. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#115:2>
Lina claims he has never experienced an epidemic in his farm
during his 15 years in the business.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-024#116:2>
Why Philippine monkeys do not die of Ebola fever here but do so in
America is curious. </p> </I>
