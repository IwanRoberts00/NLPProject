<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#1:1>
I am having a lot of trouble focusing on work and studies these
days because the issue of the NGEC has not stopped haunting me.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#2:1>
So, since I can't seem to get away from the issue, and am congenitally
unable to absorb theory unless I see it through the prism of reality first, I
might as well bring NGEC and similarly bothersome matters into my response
papers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#3:1>
Here goes: </p>

<h> THE &ldquo; STREAMLINED &rdquo; CURRICULUM: &ldquo; FETISHIZATION
&rdquo; IN PROGRESS </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#5:1>
Ma. Theresa Wright

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#6:1>
First, some clarifications on an important term in the title
above: <mention> &ldquo; streamlined &rdquo; </mention> is how some of our
university administrators would like to describe the New General Education
Curriculum, the details of which are still being hammered out though the
general idea behind it is already clear: to rid the curriculum of certain
Humanities courses believed to be redundant, or irrelevant, or ( horrors!)
inimical to the interests of globalization.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#7:1>
Among the candidates for reduction or excision in this &ldquo;
streamlining &rdquo; are Literature and Pilipino ( oh, so irrelevant to the
times and so unprofitable are they!).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#8:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Streamlined. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#9:1>
That 's some signifier, invoking thoughts of ( and yearnings for)
stability, economy, efficiency: signifieds so dear to administrators '
hearts.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#10:1>
Some of us in the DLWF faculty, however, feel that administration can
just stuff that signifier and the new curriculum up their
signifieds-which-share-a-signifier-with-donkeys ( a wonderful illustration,
btw, of the arbitrariness of the sign).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#11:1>
From where we stand, there should be better adjectives for the new
curriculum: <mention> &ldquo; reduced &rdquo; </mention> is a possible
choice, or if we want a term with more graphic significations, <mention>
&ldquo; mangled. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#12:1>
Or perhaps we can express our opinion of the new curriculum even
better with its own initials which, quite serendipitously, match a sign
commonly used in the linguistic community of this time, of this place, as an
interjection: <mention> NGEC! </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#13:1>
( Elsewhere - is it at UP or CHED? - the globalization-oriented
curriculum is labeled <mention> &ldquo; Revised General Education Curriculum,
&rdquo; </mention> or RGEC for short.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#14:1>
Now if this linguistic community were to adopt those initials as a
sign, they would have an onomatopoeic signifier that yields a whole slew of
signifieds, from a frog vocalizing on a lilypad, to a puddle of <foreign>
vomitus </foreign> .)

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#15:1>
That being said, on to more important matters: Sid 's extremely
helpful and instructive discussion of Mitchell 's essay on Marxism, ideology,
and fetishism, and how this relates to the NGEC issue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#16:1>
I 'd like to pick up the point Sid makes at the end of his
discussion: that in this essay Mitchell <quote> &ldquo; underlines the
historical place of the image in the articulation of ideas, such that
textuality is bound to imagery in a relationship of mutual translation.
&rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#17:1>
I understand this to mean that to Mitchell, images do not just
materialize out of the blue but rather have their significations shaped by
texts, even as they also shape the significations of texts, within specific
discursive contexts.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#18:1>
I like the way Mitchell, quoted by Sid, puts it: <quote> &ldquo; we
create much of our world out of the dialogue between verbal and pictorial
representation. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#19:1>
In the discourse surrounding the NGEC, verbal and pictorial
representations have been flying fast and furious.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#20:1>
Among the first &ldquo; signs &rdquo; to be invoked in defense of the
NGEC were those of the University of the Philippines and Harvard University.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#21:1>
In this linguistic community, those two signs are instantly
associated with academic excellence and high intellectual standards.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#22:1>
And the name <mention> &ldquo; UP &rdquo; </mention> comes to us with
a powerful pictorial representation - the <mention> Oblation </mention> -
which, by association with the verbal representation, has acquired the same
significations of excellence and intellectualism, to which the university 's
history of activism has further added the signification of sacrifice for
country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#23:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Harvard, &rdquo; </mention> at least to me, evokes
no non-verbal images, but few academics, I imagine, would <bold> not </bold>
respond with knee-jerk respect and awe for that institution 's place in
America 's educational history.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#24:1>
And so Admi gives its opening salvo: the NGEC is modeled
after/inspired by the UP and Harvard curricula, both of which offer students
a pared-down core curriculum to which they would be free to add their choices
from a list of courses categorized by disciplines.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#25:1>
Subsequent research by one of our faculty has revealed that the first
curriculum proposal presented to us cannot even begin to compare with that of
Harvard, but by linking it with a trend sweeping the globe, Admi has taken
the first step towards the NGEC 's fetishization.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#26:1>
In this country, the word <mention> &ldquo; global &rdquo; </mention>
has morphed into an alternative signifier for success and material progress,
so anything linked to it is expected to find instant acceptability ( who
doesn't want success and progress, after all?).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#27:1>
Acceptability is the cornerstone of any object 's fetishization -
without it, no object can work its magic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#28:1>
But Admi 's first attempt has been less than successful - has
elicited hostility, in fact, so now it is sending forth new verbal
representations, among them one of Admi top brass being <quote> &ldquo; upset
&rdquo; </quote> at having been so misrepresented and misunderstood.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#29:1>
New signifiers have also been appended to the top brass 's memo on
the NGEC ( the very memo that started the wheels turning): whereas with the
initial proposal, the memo was presented as <mention> &ldquo; orders, &rdquo;
</mention> now that signifier has been replaced by <mention> &ldquo;
suggestion, &rdquo; </mention> meaning we can offer <mention> &ldquo;
counter-suggestions. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#30:1>
All this in an attempt to neutralize the &ldquo; enemy. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#31:1>
But <quote> there 's the rub </quote> , as Hamlet would say: Admi has
set unshakable parameters of time and space for the shaping of
countersuggestions.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#32:1>
Time - one month, or less than that by now, because a decision has to
be reached by term 's end.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#33:1>
Space - as in, intellectual/ideological space - we 'd have to create
that in the little time we have, because Admi , to whom the NGEC is not a
debatable issue but already a reality that only needs refining, certainly
won't give us any.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#34:1>
For Faculty, the ideological battle is the tougher one: for
generations, literature and the national language held secure positions in
school curricula because they were widely accepted as signs of culture and
civilization.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#35:1>
Now a globalizing environment is attaching to these signs a different
set of signifiers which are inimical to their very survival - <mention>
&ldquo; irrelevant, &rdquo; &ldquo; outdated, &rdquo; &ldquo; superfluous
&rdquo; </mention> - signifiers which we will have to counter with another
set that will protect these fields by making them acceptable to the &ldquo;
globalizers. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#36:1>
Here, too, acceptability is the cornerstone, and linguistic
appropriation may be one strategy we can use to achieve this: use the
language of the globalizers to defend our fields. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#37:1>
At this time, everything is in flux - everything, that is, except
for the concept of the NGEC.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#38:1>
That is in place, like it or not.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#39:1>
What Admi is simply trying to do is find a formula for making it
accepted first as a given, then as a desirable goal, then, ultimately, as the
one true path to educational progress.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#40:1>
By then, the NGEC will have already attained tangible form as a
document, an object capable of being represented both verbally ( its
contents) and pictorially ( contents plus the paper on which they are
written).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#41:1>
By then ( this is Admi 's wish which it will work mightily to
achieve), the NGEC will have turned into DLSU 's fetish, a document perceived
to be the embodiment of &ldquo; world-class &rdquo; education and therefore
of intellectual and material progress in a single-economy world.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#42:1>
He/She who worships this fetish, of course, will be assured of a
place in the university, may even rise to its pantheon of gods - that is
where the magic always lies in capitalist fetishism: the prospect of material
security and advancement within the system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#43:1>
The NGEC discourse is a painful one, not just because of its
implications for literature, language, and culture, but because in order to
win the battle, Faculty may no longer use those signifiers which have, up to
this point, been part of their ideological vocabulary: heart, soul,
principle, commitment, love, life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#44:1>
Sometimes, progress destroys, and destroys absolutely. </p> </I>

<quote> &ldquo; ... The basic asymmetry that appears in the
traditional mythology of women stems from the official, male-dominated

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#X48:2>
Officially, women are not as human as men...

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#X49:2>
Mythical woman is therefore hellish and heavenly beyond her male

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#X51:2>
- - Denise Lardner Carmody, <it> Mythological Woman </it> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#52:2>
The significance of myths has long been pointed out in the
different sciences, especially psychoanalysis and literature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#53:2>
On a less intellectual and more down-to-earth plane, however, myths
are simply tales to be enjoyed-not less for their ability to entertain and
fascinate us, than for their ability to make us <it> think </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#54:2>
I think that despite their magical and enigmatic qualities, myths
are primarily life-related; a whole thesis has been done suggesting that
myths may have been origins of philosophical systems.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#55:2>
Given such an exalted role in human existence, myths are consequently
powerful sociopolitical instruments; and as Beauvoir argues, they have
indubitably been employed in the service of patriarchy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#56:2>
Being a woman ( who loves myths), I received with a mixture of
awe and dismay Beauvoir 's ( 1949: 197) proposition that <quote> &ldquo; [
man] projects upon [ woman] what he desires and what he fears, what he loves
and what he hates. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#X57:2>
And if it is so difficult to say anything specific about her, that
is because man seeks the whole of himself in her and because she is All.
&rdquo; </X> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#58:2>
Using an existentialist framework, Beauvoir here interprets the
Otherness of woman as being correlated with the in-itself; with man,
naturally, as the for-itself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#59:2>
Long before I 've ever heard of Sartre 's <foreign> <it> en soi
</it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it> pour soi </it> </foreign> , I 've always
regarded myself as the star player in my existence.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#60:2>
It would never have occurred to me back then that I could actually be
thought of as an Other; as a being so conflated with diverse <it> and </it>
irreconcilable representations, meanings, functions, roles, and symbolism
that it is <it> impossible </it> to perform all of them-at least without
going quietly insane.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#61:2>
Even though a woman may inwardly refuse to assume these roles imposed
on her by masculine ideologies, nevertheless I observe that she often
perceives it as a duty to <it> become </it> his Other; to jump through the
hoops that society and culture ceaselessly throw in her general direction.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#62:2>
I think she does this because she has never read Beauvoir 's
<mention> <it> The Second Sex </it> </mention> ; and if she has, then either
hasn't been convinced by Beauvoir or she has simply failed to understand
Beauvoir. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#63:2>
Perhaps I wouldn't exactly be exaggerating should I say that
reading <mention> <it> The Second Sex </it> </mention> would leave one (
especially someone belonging to the second sex) with a permanently altered
worldview.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#64:2>
The details and concerns that have previously appeared to be so
normal to oneself may become suddenly grotesque and disillusioning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#65:2>
For those of us ( I assume this <mention> 'us' </mention> would
include <foreign> na&iuml;ve </foreign> young women on the brink of 'twentyhood' )
who had nursed hundreds of versions of dreams of one day becoming a
lover/wife/mother ( not necessarily in this order) may find ourselves
crash-landing painfully to earth.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#66:2>
Personally, after reading that excerpt from Beauvoir, I
felt...curiously deflated.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#67:2>
At the same time, I also felt empowered.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#68:2>
Strange.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#69:2>
Perhaps conflict is the destiny of woman? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#70:2>
Barring such essentialist notions aside, I would say that I feel
empowered because now, I feel as though my eyes had been truly opened to <it>
reality </it> ( to use the <foreign> clich&eacute; </foreign> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#71:2>
Perhaps I cannot change my circumstances overnight; and it may be
impossible to completely subvert the workings of tradition and culture.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#72:2>
But <it> at least </it> , I am aware of the Otherness that is imposed
on me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#73:2>
I used to &ldquo; hold on &rdquo; to things that are symbolically
feminine; things that have always been affirmed to be feminine.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#74:2>
I suppose my environment had a lot to do with this; even now, I would
say that I am surrounded by ( well-meaning?) chauvinists for family, friends,
relative, and acquaintances.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#75:2>
Not a day passes that I am not reminded that I should be this or
that; I should act this way and that; and sometimes, I should <it> feel </it>
this way or that.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#76:2>
I must admit though, that at one time I used to follow them in the
mistaken assumption that this is how things should be. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#77:2>
I was born a woman.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#78:2>
And so therefore, I should <it> be </it> a woman.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#79:2>
Little did I know that most people 's definition of 'woman' is -
well, this is how Beauvoir puts it: <quote> &ldquo; treasure, prey, sport and
danger, nurse, guide, judge, mediatrix, mirror, woman is the Other in whom
the subject transcends himself without being limited, who opposes him without
denying him; she is the Other who lets herself be taken without ceasing to be
the Other.... &rdquo; </quote> ( Beauvoir, 1949: 186) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#80:2>
It still remains to be seen if I am indeed capable of the kind of
transcendence that Beauvoir talks about.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#81:2>
I certainly would not hesitate to affirm myself as a subject.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#82:2>
Perhaps it all boils down to learning how to think for oneself; to
finding the wherewithal by which to stand for the principles one believes in
<it> despite </it> the disapproval of others ( even and especially the <it>
men </it> one loves, if one loves some).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#83:2>
I think that to be truly feminist is to give up &ldquo; happiness
&rdquo; as one had previously conceived it to be; and to redefine &ldquo;
happiness &rdquo; in terms of how one would live life, first and foremost,
<it> for oneself </it> and according to one 's wants and desires. </p>

<h> The Case </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#96:3>
After being cast away in a storm off the coast of the Cape of
Good Hope in 1884, four English sailors shared a lifeboat in which they had
no supply of water and food for an indefinitely long time.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#97:3>
The sailors included three adult men and one teenage boy.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#98:3>
They were more than 1,000 miles ashore, and were in a very real
danger of death-mainly through starvation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#99:3>
On one occasion they caught a turtle, which however was consumed
within a few days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#100:3>
On the eighteenth day, Dudley and Stephens spoke to Brooks about
the imminence of death, and their only recourse: to sacrifice one among them
in order to save the rest.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#101:3>
Brooks dissented, and the boy was not consulted.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#102:3>
The prisoners also mentioned their families as a reason for the
preservation of their own lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#103:3>
Then Dudley proposed that the boy, incapacitated by hunger and
sickness, be killed the next morning if no rescue vessel appeared. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#104:3>
No such vessel did, and Stephens slit the boy 's throat on the
twentieth day.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#105:3>
The three remaining sailors fed upon his body and blood.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#106:3>
Four days later, <quote> &ldquo; in the lowest state of prostration,
&rdquo; </quote> they were rescued by a passing ship.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-002#107:3>
They wouldn't have been able to survive had they not killed the boy
and subsisted on his remains. </p> ... </I>
