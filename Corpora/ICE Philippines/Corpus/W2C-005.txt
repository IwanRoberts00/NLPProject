<h> * <it> Give capital punishment one year - - Cuevas </it> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#4:1>
<h> * Judges asked to set execution dates </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#5:1>
The Department of Justice ( DoJ) will recommend that Congress
reexamine or abolish the death penalty law, if, after a year, there is no
clear indication that capital punishment is an effective deterrent against
crime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#6:1>
In a press conference yesterday, Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas
said he would endorse to Congress a review of the death penalty if the crime
rate remains high within a year, despite carrying out the execution of
convicts by lethal injection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#7:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We will be remiss if we do not review the law, if
there is no indication that the reimposition of capital punishment is an
effective deterrent against crime, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#8:1>
In the Supreme Court, at least four justices believe that Republic
Act 7659, otherwise known as the death penalty law, is unconstitutional. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#9:1>
Meanwhile, the next execution by lethal injection may take place
before the end of the month, Cuevas said, since the DoJ is now working on the
cases of five convicts whose death sentences have already been declared
<quote> &ldquo; final and executory" </quote> by the SC. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#10:1>
The judges who meted the death penalty on the convicts have been
asked by the DoJ to schedule the executions. </p> </I>

Former President Fidel V. Ramos, returning from the United States
before dawn yesterday, expressed dismay over reports linking him to &ldquo;
missing &rdquo; funds representing &peso;7.8 billion to modernize the Armed
Forces. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#14:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I cannot be a punching bag of people just because
I am an ex-president, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#15:2>
The day before the former president 's arrival, the House
committee that probed the funds moved to exonerate Ramos and recommend that
the Estrada government shoulder the cost of the program.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#16:2>
The investigation has been placed under the chamber 's &ldquo; least
priorities. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#17:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I am still performing my duties for our country
as a sovereign citizen on a voluntary basis, &rdquo; </quote> Ramos said,
visibly miffed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#18:2>
Congressmen in the committee on good government blame Ramos '
Administrative Order 236 for the &ldquo; disappearance &rdquo; of the fund.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#19:2>
But according to Ramos, <quote> &ldquo; What happened in my view from
the top is that many emergencies had to be attended to during the latter part
of 1997 and the first half of 1998 &rdquo; </quote> during his term.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#20:2>
Due to <mention> <foreign> El Ni&ntilde;o </foreign> </mention> and
other crises, Ramos explained, money from the general fund was nearly
exhausted, and reserves from the Departments of Agriculture, Social Welfare,
Public Works and others was utilized <quote> &ldquo; to make sure that our
country would be kept afloat. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#21:2>
He continued: <quote> &ldquo; As I have been saying all along,
this is a matter that can be cleared by the outgoing secretaries of budget
and finance with their incoming counterparts. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#22:2>
As for the proceeds from the conversion of military base lands,
Ramos said he hopes that his critics would examine how the proceeds were
applied: <quote> &ldquo; they were not malversed by the BCDA ( Bases
Conversion Development Authority). &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#23:2>
He cited projects undertaken with those funds, such as the
transfer of military units and personnel to places out of Fort Bonifacio,
with the Light Armor Brigade now in Capas, Tarlac; transfer of major
operating units of the Air Force from Villamor Air Base to Fernando Air Base
in Lipa; two massive housing areas alongside C-5 to relocate people from Fort
Bonifacio, for officials, enlisted personnel, policemen and civilian
employees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#24:2>
Stressing that his government was not amiss in efforts to
modernize the AFP, he mentioned the purchase for &peso;2.2 billion of 150
armored vehicles called the <mention> &ldquo; Simba, &rdquo; </mention>
acquisition of one entire squadron of multi-purpose S2-11 jets at &dollar;160
million, 18 trainer aircraft, and three British frigates for the Navy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#25:2>
Ramos said that the &peso;7.8-billion fund <quote> &ldquo; is not
completely lost, because there are more coming from Metro Pacific, &rdquo;
</quote> explaining that their payments have not been up-to-date because 96
hectares of the original 220 hectares due Metro Pacific have not been cleared
of squatters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#26:2>
Ramos addressed the international luncheon meeting of the 47th
National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 3 in Washington D.C. on an invitation of
Rep. Steve Largent, US President Bill Clinton was guest of honor, and among
those who attended were Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat and the widow of
the late Israel Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#27:2>
From Washington D.C., Ramos proceeded to Atlanta, Georgia, where
he met with executives of the Southern Company and Oglethorpe University.

Receding floodwaters in four provinces in Mindanao allowed
rescuers to finally distribute relief goods and save stranded villagers from
rooftops and trees yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#31:3>
Flash floods triggered by heavy and incessant rains in the
Cagayan Autonomous Region and Growth Area ( Caraga) killed 17 persons while
three others were reported missing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#32:3>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado led government officials in
distributing relief goods to victims. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#33:3>
<h> <bold> Logging did this </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#34:3>
Mercado, Environment Secretary Antonio Cerilles and Surigao Rep.
Robert Ace Barbers blamed illegal loggers for the flash floods. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#35:3>
Barbers, whose own district was hit hard by chest-high floods,
urged his colleagues in the House to pass a law that will classify illegal
logging as a heinous crime punishable by death. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#36:3>
<quote> &ldquo; This disastrous calamity would not have
transpired if we were more responsible in preserving the trees in the area
and if we were more sensitive toward the needs of future generations, &rdquo;
</quote> Barbers said as he accused selfish businessmen in cahoots with
corrupt Department of the Environment and Natural Resources officials for the
deaths and damage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#37:3>
According to the defense secretary, illegal logging activities
severely denuded the forests surrounding the Agusan River, the country 's
second largest river, making the area prone to such sudden and devastating
floods. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#38:3>
<h> <bold> Damage reports </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#39:3>
Out of 87,402 families ( 402,900 persons) registered by the
Department of Social Welfare and Development as adversely affected by flash
floods in Caraga, only 22.59 percent of affected families received relief and
assistance from the DSWD. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#40:3>
The DSWD Disaster Response Operations Monitoring and Information
Service ( DROMIC) said the remaining 67,703 unserved families refused to
leave their properties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#41:3>
Of the casualties listed by disaster relief personnel, DROMIC
said 17 bodies were recovered and three others are missing, but have not been
declared dead. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#42:3>
Family members of 10 of the fatalities positively identified the
victims as Gaudencio Lagbas, 19; Denci Lobo, 4; Virgilio Villana; Riche
Gracasic, 12, all of Agusan del Norte; in Agusan del Sur, those declared dead
were Romilyn Mabandas, 19; Fil Jineta 12; Jinel Asipa, 13; Alex Malasang
Apalle, 27, and Analyn and Lovely Curato, 13 and 8, respectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#43:3>
Some 550 homes were damaged, 88 of which were totally destroyed.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#44:3>
But Caraga officials said they are unsure how long their supplies
will last, because they do not know how long evacuees will remain in the
shelters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#45:3>
These flash floods have damaged crops worth &peso;44.98 million,
the Department of Agriculture ( DA) reported. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#46:3>
A damage report from the Presidential <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a
</foreign> Task Force said that damage to crops alone totalled &peso;21.8
million and that the floods ravaged over 7,200 hectares of farmlands. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#47:3>
Meanwhile, in Region X, a total of 559 families ( 2,643 persons)
were displaced by similar floods in Balinsag and Cagayan de Oro City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#48:3>
The provincial government there had already extended relief
amounting to &peso;48,440. </p>

floods. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#51:3>
Cerilles suspended all mining and forestry permits and licenses
there as part of the department 's remedial and flood control measures.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#52:3>
These permits and licenses will remain suspended until the DENR has
made a thorough review of the damage wrought by the <foreign> La Ni&ntilde;a

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#53:3>
He also warned that <quote> &ldquo; the next cycle of rains could

problem now.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#54:3>
The damage assessment report is crucial in undertaking such measures.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#56:3>
Agriculture Secretary William Dar said his department has set
aside &peso;20 million to help farmers affected by the floods.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#57:3>
This money, Dar said, will be used for purchasing farm equipment such
as mechanical dryers, rice threshers, corn shellers and other post-harvest
facilities and farm equipment.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#58:3>
<indig> Palay </indig> , corn, grafted <foreign> durian </foreign>
seedlings and other crop seedlings suitable to the affected areas will also
be distributed by the DA. </p>

<p>

<h> <bold> Duty-free soybean imports bucked </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#61:4>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#62:4>
A government plan to bring in soybean meal at zero tariff will
greatly jeopardize the local soybean processing industry, according to an
industry spokesman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#63:4>
In a letter to Agriculture Secretary William Dar, Ric Pinca,
corporate affairs director of General Milling Corporation, claimed the
importation of soybean meal tax-free could even mean the end of the entire
industry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#64:4>
<quote> &ldquo; The plan to allow importation of soybean at zero
duty will kill the local soybean processing industry and unnecessarily place
the country 's food security in the hands of foreign soybean processors and
traders whose greed for profit show no mercy nor consideration for the
country 's needs, &rdquo; </quote> Pinca said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#65:4>
The duty-free importation of soybean meal, according to the DA,
is under Section 109 of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#66:4>
Covered by the duty-free provision of AFMA are commodities identified
as an important input to enhance farm production in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#67:4>
Prior to the AFMA implementation, the duty-free provision of AFMA
in the case of soybean imports are charged three percent to zero percent.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#68:4>
However, Pinca said, the proposal to remove the tariff on soybean
constitutes a violation of Section 2 of AFMA which states that <quote>
&ldquo; the state shall enhance the competitiveness of the agriculture and
fisheries sectors in both domestic and foreign markets. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#69:4>
<quote> &ldquo; The proposal to reduce the tariff in soybean, a
finished product, reduces the competitiveness of local soybean processing
industry against foreign processors and endangers the very survival of the
industry that strives to promote local processing and self-sufficiency in the
supply of this vital commodity, &rdquo; </quote> Pinca said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#70:4>
<quote> &ldquo; Once local competition is eliminated, suppliers
will enjoy a monopoly or stranglehold on the local market, &rdquo; </quote>
he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#71:4>
Also, the proposal would place the tariff level of soybean meal,
a finished product, at par with that of soybeans, a raw material.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#72:4>
<quote> &ldquo; This will result in a distortion in the tariff
structure with soybeans, a raw material having the same zero duty as soybean
meal.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#73:4>
Raw materials normally have lower tariff than finished products,
&rdquo; </quote> he pointed out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#74:4>
On top of these, the government would lose over &peso;216 million
in annual revenues should tariff on imported soybean meal be reduced to zero,
Pinca said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#75:4>
Last year, the country imported over one million metric tons of
soybean meal.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#76:4>
At an average landing cost of &dollar;185 per MT and at three-percent
tariff, the imports were levied a total of &dollar;5.55 million or about
&peso;216 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#77:4>
Despite the adverse consequences, Pinca said that some DA
officials are pushing for the zero tariff on soybean meal. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Plastic makers bracing for showdown with petrochem firm
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#79:5>
Plastic makers have threatened to boycott local petrochemical
companies that continue to seek protection from government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#80:5>
The Philippine Plastic Industry Association ( PPIA), composed of
300 firms employing some 300,000 people, made the threat after petrochemical
firms supported proposals for government to use higher values in the
computation of tariffs on petrochem products including plastic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#81:5>
Sources at the PPIA said plastic makers would rather import
resins ( a raw material in plastic production) instead of buying the material
from local petrochemical firms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#82:5>
The boycott was meant to send a strong message to the
petrochemical companies that just received tariff protection from government
when duties on resin were raised to 15 percent from 10 percent, PPIA sources
said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#83:5>
The use of the higher values in the computation of tariffs, which
will raise the cost of production for the plastic makers, had been supported
by the National Steel Corporation ( NSC). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#84:5>
The plastic makers said they would join forces with the
downstream users of steel products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#85:5>
<quote> &ldquo; We are their clients and we should work together
to develop the industry but they are killing us, &rdquo; </quote> the PPIA
source said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#86:5>
The recent round of tariff adjustments has led some sectors to
believe that the government is biased against some industries or
corporations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#87:5>
The use of the higher-published values in the computation of
tariffs, if adopted, will only confirm views that the Estrada administration
is reverting back to the <foreign> <it> padrino </it> </foreign> system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#88:5>
The NSC is the main petitioner for the use of the
higher-valuation system which is being studied by the Customs valuation team
( CTV). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#89:5>
Some quarters fear that the proposal is <quote> &ldquo; already
written in stone &rdquo; </quote> because of NSC 's ties with the Department
of Finance.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#90:5>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu brokered the sale of Wing Tiek
Holdings <foreign> Berhad </foreign> 's 82.5-percent stake in the NSC to the
Hong Kong-based Hottick Investments Limited.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#91:5>
Finance Under-secretary Solomon Cua was once an official of the NSC.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#92:5>
The DoF had drafted an unnumbered memorandum order containing the
proposal for the use of higher values in the computation of tariffs which was
presented to the CVT. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#93:5>
The CVT is headed by the Bureau of Customs, an attached agency of
the DoF. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#94:5>
To make matters worse, the NSC is the only single corporation
with a membership in the CVT.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-005#95:5>
Other private sector representatives in the CVT are umbrella
organizations such as the Federation of Philippine Industries and the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry. </p> </I>
