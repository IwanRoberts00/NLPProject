<h> <bold> The proper way to see a temple </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#3:1>
I USED to be indifferent to these beautiful structures of Buddhism
or Hinduism ( like Borobudur), because whenever I am in front of them, the
guide reminds you, <quote> &ldquo; I 'm giving you 45 minutes to look around
- - please be back on the bus on time. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#4:1>
And it would be high noon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#5:1>
But it pays to mature.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#6:1>
Now the six of us have come on our own in Indonesia, using Paleo
Santoso 's van, and always the sun is near to setting.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#7:1>
If we wished, we could sit and meditate on every level of the
Prambanan temple ( in Yogyakarta), lean our backs on the bell-shaped
<foreign> stupas </foreign> of Borobudur, drinking in all the carvings on the
stone walls, dance with devotion around the Hindu gods of Suku temple ( in
Solo), chug up to Ceto ( frightening a lot of cows), getting out of the
vehicle and pushing because the temple is on a very high mountain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#8:1>
Temples are located in high places for obvious reasons: it is
easier to commune with one 's god in undiluted air, surrounded by trees, and
it 's nearer heaven.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#9:1>
Ceto temple is one of the last vestiges of the Madjapahit empire.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#10:1>
Its king was daunted by the onslaught of Mohammedanism - - he was of
the Hindu religion, and a staunch one, and not even his son, a Muslim
convert, could persuade him.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#11:1>
The king fled to Suku, to Ceto, to the mountain of Lawu, 3,000 feet
above sea level, then disappeared. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#12:1>
<h> <bold> Heroes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#13:1>
Indonesian tales are replete with heroes disappearing into thin
air, and if you know your mythology ( or your <mention> &ldquo; Celestine
Prophecy &rdquo; </mention> ) , it is because the bodies of people with
mystical consciousness become invisible to mortals of lower vibrations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#14:1>
And so, here we are in Ceto, among the ruins of a 16th-century
Hindu temple.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#15:1>
Being too high up, it is not a tourist destination.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#16:1>
There are at least 10 flights of steps to the top.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#17:1>
Flat ground for resting in between, with an altar if you turn left
and another if you go right. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#18:1>
Roofed platforms have been built in front of each altar where one
can sit and contemplate the deity, breathing deeply of the mountain air.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#19:1>
Down below sits an ancient stone turtle, guarding the secrets of
history deep within its heart. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#20:1>
The symbols of the temple of Ceto are those of creation: the
<foreign> <it> lingam </it> </foreign> , represented in all its erect, if by
now moldering, glory in one of the altars and the <foreign> <it> yoni </it>
</foreign> , represented by the narrow, split portal through which one passes
to reach the open space at the top. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#21:1>
I do not find the usual representations of Hindu gods like
Krishna, Vishnu and Shiva that are familiar to me from my encyclopedia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#22:1>
Instead, at the last altar, I come face to face with a pudgy, almost
comical deity with a Stalinesque moustache!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#23:1>
We regard each other with grave misgivings.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#24:1>
For here we are, you and I, in the final analysis - - you are the god
of my ancestors but you are a stranger to me.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#25:1>
In fact, in my ignorance, I find you grotesque and slightly
ridiculous.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#26:1>
Why are you not in silk raiments and jewels, and no gold halo quivers
above your head? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#27:1>
<h> <bold> A similarity in myths </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#28:1>
From our own prehistory, we learned that the first settlers in
the Philippines were Indonesians and Malays who had come fleeing from
oppressive tributes and other persecutions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#29:1>
Through much contact during the Madjapahit empire, we share with
the Indonesians a similarity in myths and syllabic writing ( a kind of
hieroglyphics, no less), all of which we have forgotten, adopting instead the
alphabet and the fairy tales of other lands. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#30:1>
We are brothers in features and skin, but in nothing else.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#31:1>
We share a few root words but not our mind-set.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#32:1>
Without a <foreign> Bahasa </foreign> guidebook, one could perish
with hunger in a <foreign> <it> leseha </it> </foreign> ( native restaurant)
and never get on in a <foreign> <it> betya </it> </foreign> ( <indig> pedicab
</indig> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#33:1>
And so, to Indonesia we have been invited, to the garden of
Suprapto Suyodarmo, our host, where a 10-day festival is taking place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#34:1>
The male dancers have waist-long hair ( not one a gay), swinging
their heads to and fro, their bodies slim and graceful, bending circularly in
all directions, down to the floor and up, here in Solo, where the soft body
has not yet become the province of women.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#35:1>
It was some kind of ritual they were performing.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#36:1>
The women sang with a weird nasal twang ( almost like a caterwaul),
looking sideward and up to heaven, their long, pointed, steel-tipped
fingernails twinkling in the moonlight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#37:1>
We watch with rapt attention.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#38:1>
But what does it all mean?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#39:1>
It is obvious that these are a people who know who they are, who are
proud of their roots, who dance ( no matter how weirdly to me) as they always
have. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#40:1>
Was this how we would have been had we preserved our original
Asian culture instead of learning how to cook <indig> <it> adobo </it>
</indig > ?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#41:1>
Is it better or worse that they can speak no English and their
orchestra is composed of gongs, xylophones and reed flutes while my symphony
orchestra wears tuxedos and plays <mention> Prokofiev </mention> ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#42:1>
In the festival I meet people of different races.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#43:1>
Many are from Europe, traveling all that way from Germany, the
Netherlands, Denmark, England, France, also the United States, Mexico,
Australia and all parts of Indonesia. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#44:1>
<h> <bold> Dance </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#45:1>
We share a common language, that of movement.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#46:1>
Not ballet, ballroom or folk dancing but a creative, almost
ritualistic dance that comes from deep within the self.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#47:1>
Not dance as performance but as meditation, as examination of self to
find access to buried feelings and issues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#48:1>
The fastest way to connect to the spirit is through the body.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#49:1>
But first, there must be a house cleaning.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#50:1>
Suprapto Suyodarmo had introduced <mention> &ldquo; shared movement
&rdquo; </mention> to us in Manila, and now we were meeting his many other
students from all over the world. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#51:1>
<h> <bold> Different bodies </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#52:1>
How interesting to observe how bodies bred in other countries
move so differently from ours!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#53:1>
The German woman 's gestures are cosmic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#54:1>
She runs and leaps with great energy, strength that comes only from
big-framed, milk-and-cheese-nourished Caucasian bodies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#55:1>
The Dutch and Danish males, one in black felt hat, the other in
<indig> <it> sando </it> </indig> , are somber, moving silently, engrossed in
their inner struggles.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#56:1>
They are very protective of their private space. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#57:1>
Out of nowhere, a young Anglo-Saxon with funky blonde hair, whom
I 'd never seen before, comes into the dancing space.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#58:1>
Her movements are angular, twisted, as if dancing to big-city noise,
her head rolling wildly ( I almost expect her tongue to roll out and her
eyeballs to recede). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#59:1>
The slim British bodies have finer movements, only recently
educated to be freer.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#60:1>
The passionate gestures of the Mexican are stoked by an intense fire
that a body like mine, barbecued in years of Spanish domination, easily
relates to. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#61:1>
And always the Japanese - - males and females - - are soft,
sinuous, never to be hurried.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#62:1>
Like the Filipinos, they are not afraid of body contact. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#63:1>
Soon we are moving together, the earth and the minerals and the
liquids in our bodies orchestrated by an inner music.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#64:1>
Explains the German participant Jose van der Graaf: <quote> &ldquo;
Ritual dance ( for indeed, it is one) expresses concretely, and in public, an
almost intangible experience. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#X65:1>
We share our stimulated state of consciousness with others, perhaps
even the whole community.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#X66:1>
The feeling we experience is not really aesthetic - - not all of us
are good dancers - - it is rather one of devotion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#X67:1>
In ritual dance the body is the place where the finite and the
infinite meet. </X> &ldquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#68:1>
Most Western participants are remaining here in Solo for a month
or six months.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#69:1>
Some have been living here for a year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#70:1>
They are grim and determined in their search, making us Filipinos
feel almost frivolous.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#71:1>
But why devote our lives to something we 've never lost?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#72:1>
We are, after all, a product of the East and the West. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#73:1>
It is to young searchers, who are unbathed and uncombed, their
long, pale legs scratched and dotted with flea bites, that my heart goes out.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#74:1>
Whose once lovely son or daughter is this who has traveled so
exceedingly far and lives out of a seedy backpack? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#75:1>
<h> <bold> Great exchange </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#76:1>
Some are seething with anger at mothers who, they claim, do not
love them, escaping from what they perceive to be spiritually bankrupt
environments.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#77:1>
They have decreed that here, and only here in this power spot ( Solo,
Bali, Kathmandu or somewhere in the heart of India) can they ever find their
way home.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#78:1>
( And suppose Solo cannot heal you?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#79:1>
Where do you go from here, torn flower child?)

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#80:1>
The West coming to the East for the answer!

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#81:1>
For once I am not envious of the First World 's museums, buildings,
commerce and health. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#82:1>
Then I am reminded that today is a Monday.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#83:1>
For four years now, on Monday evenings in Manila, our group comes
together to study, deeply and adoringly not a <foreign> lama </foreign> , but
a 19th century German philosopher named Rudolf Steiner.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#84:1>
An egghead. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#85:1>
For years we struggled through Steiner 's rich and difficult
writings: it was he who set us on our little traveled path.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#86:1>
( When we felt we were getting too mental, too top heavy, &ldquo;
sharing dance &rdquo; restored the balance.)

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#87:1>
Strange, orientals seeking in the cold tomes of the West their
kindest, truest guidance?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#88:1>
A great exchange, if you ask me. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#89:2>
<h> <bold> Three centennial works: Enigmatic, rousing, original
</bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#90:2>
<bold> Rosalinda L. Orosa </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#91:2>
Too many &ldquo; happenings &rdquo; made it virtually impossible
for me to attend every single one of them.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#92:2>
At the two-night <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Alay sa Sandaang Taon
</indig> &ldquo; </mention> at the CCP, I missed hearing the works of Ramon
Santos and Chino Toledo, both of whom had been expressly commissioned to
compose for the centennial.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#93:2>
In the past, I did have occasion to listen and appreciate Mr. Santos 's
compositions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#94:2>
The second night of <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Alay </indig>
&ldquo; </mention> featured three pieces.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#95:2>
These were, in chronological order, <mention> &ldquo; Centennial
Tribute to Filipino Womanhood &rdquo; </mention> by National Artist Lucrecia
R. Kasilag, <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Alamat ng Lahi </indig> &ldquo;
</mention> by National Artist Lucio San Pedro, and <mention> &ldquo; Rituals
&rdquo; </mention> by Jeffrey Ching. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#96:2>
Concept of Miss Kasilag 's work, described as <quote> &ldquo; a
symphonic cycle in four parts for orchestra, indigenous instruments and mixed
media" </quote> was by Ma. Paz Lagdameo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#97:2>
Others involved in its execution were Deniza Reyes, choreographer;
Irma Adlawan Marasigan, Eve ( Adam was not identified); Dennis R. Marasigan,
lighting designer; Nonon Padilla, director. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#98:2>
Mrs. Lagdameo 's concept, as explained in the beautifully written
program notes, is on a high, grandiose, idealistic plane, doubtless in
keeping with the serious Centennial theme.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#99:2>
In interpretation, however, the joint effort of composer and
choreographer did not seem to reflect it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#100:2>
Miss Kasilag had asserted to a member of the audience that her
tribute to Filipino womanhood was meant to depict <quote> &ldquo; light
humor." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#101:2>
When viewed within this context, the work could indeed pass as a
clever satire, farce or caricature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#102:2>
Recall, for instance, the ballerina in leotards and tights
executing <foreign> fouettes </foreign> <foreign> <it> en pointes </it>
</foreign> to the very discernible tune of <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Ako ay
Filipino </indig> &ldquo; </mention> ; or the baretorso-ed Adam appearing
with his Eve garbed in Maria Clara costume - - a wonderful parody of the
anachronistic, clinging-vine, overly modest <mention> Maria Clara </mention>
in this permissive day and age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#103:2>
Then, too, there were the five or more <mention> Maria Claras
</mention> crawling under the skirt of Eve.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#104:2>
The collective images would have portrayed in an ingenious,
tongue-in-cheek manner, the birth of sextuplets, thus proving the effectivity
of fertility pills. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#105:2>
And as a <foreign> coup de grace </foreign> , let us hark back
to the dead Adam being resuscitated by an air pump as though he were an
automobile tire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#106:2>
All these figures flitting hither and thither onstage certainly
conveyed <quote> &ldquo; light humor". </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#107:2>
However, with the program notes serving as imperative guide, the
spectator inevitably made an attempt to equate or relate concept, music, and
choreography with each other - - to no avail.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#108:2>
Accordingly, concept - - <foreign> albeit </foreign> beautifully
envisioned - - music and choreography remained as three disparate, distinct
elements, with the over-all result appearing enigmatic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#109:2>
The choreography, on its own, would have been readily
appreciated had it been viewed as a satire which obviously it was not meant
to be owing to the initial concept.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#110:2>
The music, likewise, would have been easily appreciated as an
independent creation - - a relatively conventional piece as lyrical as Miss
Kasilag could make it, she being partial to atonality.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-009#111:2>
As a concession to the centennial, the composition showed
discernible folk and contemporary Philippine songs which could have been more
tightly and subtly integrated and interwoven into the work. </p> </I>
