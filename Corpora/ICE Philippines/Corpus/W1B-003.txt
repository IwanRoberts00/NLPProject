<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#5:1>
Hi,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#6:1>
Manny was finally able to drive in the US - - and to Ohio!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#7:1>
It was completely unplanned.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#8:1>
The plan was for Anna to ship her stuff to Silver Spring, James ( her
boyfriend) to fly to Pittsburgh ( nearest airport to Anna 's school), and
both of them to take the Greyhound to Silver Spring. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#9:1>
Thursday night, Anna called to say that she had run out of packing
tape and would not be able to ship her stuff until Monday morning, because of
her exams on Friday and Saturday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#10:1>
She also wasn't sure if she could manage the shipment because she had
4 big boxes, 4 small boxes, 2 large suitcases, plus her computer monitor.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#11:1>
Friday at 4 AM, she called again to say that James finally had his
flight confirmed but to DC, not to Pittsburgh, and he was flying in Monday.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#12:1>
So Friday morning, I called several car rental companies and
lucked out with Thrifty.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#13:1>
They had a Grand Caravan available and they would accept Manny 's
international driver 's permit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#14:1>
I then checked Mapquest and downloaded the instructions to/from
Steubie. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#15:1>
Saturday, we heard the 9 AM Mass and then proceeded to Thrifty to
get the van.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#16:1>
It was brand new - - 2002 model.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#17:1>
Then we proceeded on our trip.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#18:1>
We prayed really hard because it was Manny 's first time to drive in
the US, our first time to take the road trip to Steubie, and it was going to
be a 270 mile trip over 5 hours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#19:1>
Well, we made the trip safely and with very few hitches.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#20:1>
The Mapquest directions were great - - accurate and complete.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#21:1>
The hitches were actually no one 's fault.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#22:1>
There was a detour near Pittsburgh, and again near Steubenville.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#23:1>
So of course, Mapquest 's directions went awry.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#24:1>
But we still made it after a delay of 30 very anxious moments.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#25:1>
We were blessed to have asked the assistance of an elderly parking
lot attendant who very patiently explained to me how to get back on track.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#26:1>
We got to Steubie at almost 5, almost 6 hour 's trip with a 30-minute
stopover. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#27:1>
Anna really had so much stuff!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#28:1>
<indig> ( Kanino kaya nagmana?) </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#29:1>
We had to fold the third seat and the van was so full that Manny had
no rear vision anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#30:1>
So our prayers on the way back were even more intense.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#31:1>
We left Steubie almost 11, and got home before 4.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#32:1>
We got lost only twice on the way back, and fortunately, we were able
to retrace our way with very little delay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#33:1>
But the trip was worth it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#34:1>
Anna 's friends gave her a <foreign> despedida </foreign> in the
residence lounge and they served <foreign> miso </foreign> soup, <foreign>
sushi </foreign> and carrot cake.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#35:1>
They also showed a video of her friends bidding her good-bye, which
was produced by Fatima, her best friend.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#36:1>
It was very gratifying to see how Anna was, and is, much loved by her
friends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#37:1>
After the <foreign> despedida </foreign> , we joined the Festival of
Praise ( held every first Saturday at Franciscan University), and it was such
a moving experience.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#38:1>
The first hour consisted of praise songs, and then the priest came
with the Blessed Sacrament in a procession accompanied by fervent singing.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#39:1>
The girl beside Manny got struck by the Holy Spirit several times and
collapsed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#40:1>
It was my first time to see someone being struck, and I found it a
little eerie.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#41:1>
The FOP ended past 9, and we then invited Anna 's friends - - the
twins and their boyfriends and Fatima - - to dinner.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#42:1>
We went to Happy 's and had ribs and barbecued chicken wings.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#43:1>
Then to Anna 's dorm to pick up her stuff and load them in the van.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#44:1>
I thought we wouldn't be able to fit them in!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#45:1>
We finished past 1 AM, and woke up before 7 to hear the 9 AM Mass at
FUS. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#46:1>
Then after we got home and unloaded the van, we went shopping to
take advantage of the van.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#47:1>
We went to Sears to buy a lawn mower, Anna 's computer desk,
<foreign> etc. </foreign> , and then to Giant 's for groceries.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#48:1>
We finally got home past 8. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#49:1>
So you can imagine how beat we were - - from all the lifting, the
stressful trip, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#50:1>
In fact, I went on administrative leave yesterday ( newcomers have 5
days leave to settle in, and it was my first time to take it).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#51:1>
We returned the van in the morning, and then went to Reagan National
to pick up James.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#52:1>
It 's great to have Anna home, and seeing her so happy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#53:1>
Ok, I guess that 's it for now from Silver Spring. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#54:1>
Love and prayers,

<indig> Atche </indig> ,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#61:2>
Thanks for this email and that on <indig> Tata </indig> Pitong 's
funeral.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#62:2>
I 'm glad it went well.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#63:2>
But <indig> Atcheng </indig> Corrie must really be hurting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#64:2>
I don't think she had to take anything when <indig> Tita </indig>
Song went.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#65:2>
She was really <indig> Papang </indig> 's girl, and now of course,
she 's lost both. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#66:2>
Daday is now into the second hour of her flight.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#67:2>
She 's supposed to arrive tomorrow afternoon at 4.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#68:2>
So pls. pray that she get here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#69:2>
Anna gave her a copy of the directions she had prepared for James.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#70:2>
And I asked Jennie to go through the directions with her.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#71:2>
But she sounded really scared when I talked with her this morning.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#72:2>
But I am hopeful, considering that she went to the US Embassy and the
POEA by her lonesome, and got all her papers in order. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#73:2>
<indig> Ma </indig> and <indig> Atche </indig> , James was given
6 months.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#74:2>
I told him to tell them 6 weeks when asked how long he planned to
stay.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#75:2>
And they gave him 6 months.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#76:2>
So you shouldn't worry about the one-month rule.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#77:2>
In fact, it 's still in the drawing board, and the INS is still
conducting hearings on it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#78:2>
The WB spouses association has mounted a strong lobby against it.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#79:2>
Actually, we will be more than full house.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#80:2>
We will have houseguests every weekend this May.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#81:2>
This Sunday, the children of Sally, my first supervisor at work in
IRRI is driving from Chicago and will stay two nights.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#82:2>
Her eldest son graduated <foreign> summa </foreign> in Math from La
Salle and is now working in a consulting firm in Chicago while taking
actuarial exams.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#83:2>
Sally 's daughters ( one is my <indig> inaanak </indig> ) flew to the
US to visit their brother, and they will be driving to DC, Pennsylvania and
then NY. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#84:2>
Next week-end, Tif arrives.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#85:2>
And then on Monday, Doodle ( my good friend from Philamlife), her
hubby and their three kids will be coming to DC from NY <foreign> enroute
</foreign> to Orlando.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#86:2>
They plan to stay 3 nights.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#87:2>
The following weekend, Memorial Day, we will host Anna 's friends
from NY and Ohio.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#88:2>
We also plan to have the housewarming then. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#89:2>
So it will really be the merry month of May! </p>

Nice you forgot my birthday!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#214:3>
It 's okay, you don't have to remember it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#215:3>
Have you received the pictures?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#216:3>
Let me know when you get it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#217:3>
Have a nice day too. </p>

Eddie,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#224:3>
You 're 7 yrs older than me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#225:3>
You were already courting a girl while I was in my <mention> pampers
</mention> days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#226:3>
And you 're not old!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#227:3>
And you don't look your age, you look like 35!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#228:3>
I 'm just kidding!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#229:3>
Now we 're even! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#230:3>
You got home at around 4 am?!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#231:3>
Wow!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#232:3>
What a party!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#233:3>
Hmm that 's why no one 's answering the phone when I called up.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#234:3>
I 'm kidding! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#235:3>
Have to go now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#236:3>
Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite...good night! </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-003#237:3>
