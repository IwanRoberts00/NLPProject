<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#1:1:A>
Mr Secretary good evening and welcome on your <,> your appearance tonight on <mention> Options </mention> is very timely because as we all know uh the uh <indig> welga ng bayan </indig> is being planned for this week and uh the <indig> Iglesia ni Kristo </indig> has announced that it planned a big demonstration for Saturday
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#2:1:A>
So the streets of Metro Manila will smoke and smolder again and it seems that the most volatile of issues is the oil issue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#3:1:A>
And whether you like it or not you are on the spot Mr Secretary and uh you are on record as saying that you are against any immediate rollback or decrease in the oil prices <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#4:1:A>
And so we would like to ask you what really are the positions of the Philippine government on this very very volatile issue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#5:1:A>
Will you really announce uh price decreases in the middle of August and if so what will be the amount of the price decreases

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#6:1:B>
Teddy the President has been very clear from the very beginning exactly where we stand <,> and that is there can be no oil price reduction until the O P S F deficit is wiped out
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#7:1:B>
And she has also said before <,> that it will be more prudent if we 'll allow a little bit of a buffer to be built into the O P S F
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#8:1:B>
After that uh her options have always been open but uh the problem now is uh we have a number of uh spending priorities that will have to be met especially in the light of Mount Pinatubo uh the eruptions of that volcano which are continuing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#9:1:B>
We do not know how long those eruptions are going to continue so the damage is going to be there and we have to face up to those spending priorities

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#10:1:A>
Mr Secretary August fifteen or thereabouts you will announce some price reductions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#11:1:A>
What would be the magnitude of those price reductions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#12:1:A>
In your mind right now Mr Secretary

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#13:1:B>
In my mind if I talk in terms of uh preferences I would like to have uh an average of a fifty uh centavo per liter uh reduction
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#14:1:B>
Uh there is an arithmetic to that uh Teddy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#15:1:B>
It is that we are committed to making this economy grow and in order to be able to do that there is one thing that we will have to do and that is cut that import levy which is beginning to hurt because that was the only source of revenue
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#16:1:B>
And I would like to see a fairly respectable cut to that maybe four percentage points
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#17:1:B>
Now for every percent that we cut of the import levy <,> that costs the national government two and a half billion pesos

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#18:1:A>
A lot of money huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#19:1:B>
So if you 're going to make a <unclear> words </unclear> cut that 's going to cost ten million pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#20:1:B>
In addition we have a problem of <unclear> words </unclear> which is going to cost us about seven billion pesos a year
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#21:1:B>
That brings up the cost to the national government of something like seventeen billion plus the immediate repair and uh reconstruction that that we really have to do in Central Luzon because of Mount Pinatubo
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#22:1:B>
That comes to about eighteen million pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#23:1:B>
And that 's the reason why I 've been suggesting we 'll have to be very prudent we will have to uh calculate our moves very very well because a complete rollback would simply throw away some of the gains which good luck is providing to the Philippine economy right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#24:1:B>
And if I give away fifty centavos on average per liter that will be only six billion pesos out while I can keep the eighteen billion pesos through a <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#25:1:C>
Assuming assuming uh Mr Secretary assuming <,> since you give away fifty uh fifty centavos per liter on the average assuming no new taxes no further eruptions anywhere what kind of deficit are we talking about by nineteen ninety-one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#26:1:B>
Tony we are still talking about a twenty-six billion peso deficit which is what is in the program

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#27:1:C>
Oh we 're on target

 <$B> ICE-PHI:S1B-042#28> Very very much within target as a matter of fact we are ahead of target because during the first uh semester we what we decided to do was really to manage the system very conservatively
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#28:1:B>
And so we 'd have a little bit of <unclear> words </unclear> uh for us to be able to catch up during the second semester
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#29:1:B>
Don't forget that during the first uh six months the economy was growing very uh by a very small percentage uh just about zero
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#30:1:B>
And now this is the time uh to pick up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#31:1:B>
And we can let government take the lead through precisely the public infrastructure program that we should finance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#32:1:B>
And we still stick to the twenty-six billion peso deficit that we have targeted

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#33:1:C>
Mr Secretary you said that the government is prepared to give an average rollback of fifty centavos per liter
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#34:1:C>
How does that translate for example in diesel in fuel oil premium gasoline how much would uh each one be pushed back

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#35:1:B>
Tony that depends very much on how the distribution is going to be made
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#36:1:B>
Uh this is going to be a very difficult decision because almost every group that we talked with would have a different set of suggestions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#37:1:B>
But the basic problem we have since we have intervened into the pricing of various oil products
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#38:1:B>
We have an anomaly right now where our relative price for diesel is low and our relative price for gasoline is high
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#39:1:B>
And as a result we 're importing a lot of diesel into the country while we have <{> <[> gasoline </[> which is in surplus

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#40:1:C>
<[> A surplus </[> </{> of gasoline 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#41:1:C>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#42:1:B>
And which we do not know what to do about
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#43:1:B>
So obviously if you go by the base on the basis of uh <unclear> word </unclear> market economics we should be uh cutting more on gasoline and so much less on diesel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#44:1:B>
As a matter of fact in other countries they have what they call as a <mention> mono </mention> price for both diesel and gasoline
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#45:1:B>
Because it 's fairly easy to shift from one use to the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#46:1:B>
So if the differential is very big then there 's a tendency for people to use more of the cheaper priced diesel and that 's why we 're running short of that we 're importing and uh they would use less of the dearer priced gasoline

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#47:1:C>
But the fifty centavos uh average that you 're proposing to roll back assuming for example that diesel will be lowered by average forty centavos that is really very minimal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#48:1:C>
It has no effect on the prices uh situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#49:1:C>
So that I think those who are proposing a rollback will not be happy with such a a an infinitesimal reduction in prices
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#50:1:C>
Well of course I I agree with your point of view that these measures are necessary but uh there seems to be a lack of uh uh enthusiasm on the part of the government to explain its policies in terms that people at the lower socio-economic levels can understand and appreciate

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#51:1:B>
Well I hope that we can do a better job of explaining the realities of our economy to our people because after all this is our common affair
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#52:1:B>
But uh <O> cough </O> we do not have to theorize very much about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#53:1:B>
We have had three experiences of an oil price rollback since nineteen eighty-seven and in every case it did not lead to a reduction in

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#54:1:C>
Exactly yes

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#55:1:B>
Jeepney fares

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#56:1:C>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#57:1:B>
It did not lead to a <unclear> word </unclear> of transport fares and the cost of living certainly did not uh <,> decrease
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#58:1:B>
And what is even worse is that within three months because the government built up a huge deficit then the interest rates started going up the economy slowed down and prices increased

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#59:1:C>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#60:1:B>
So people who are saying that uh uh if you cut oil prices now you will cut the prices of other commodities

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#61:1:C>
It doesn't happen

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#62:1:B>
Do not seem to remember that we 've gone through those experiences already and in every instance since nineteen eighty-seven prices after three months instead of going down actually went up

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#63:1:A>
Mr Secretary if I may temporarily shift tone of this interview because I don't want to forget
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#64:1:A>
Uh you and <.> ex </.> Executive Secretary Oscar Orbos were supposed to have engaged in a shouting match <O> laughter </O> in a cabinet meeting
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#65:1:A>
The shouting match that uh eventually led to his uh resignation from the cabinet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#66:1:A>
Mr Secretary was there really a shouting match and would you kindly tell us uh if it was <,> this and other things that led to the <.> secre </.> to Secretary <w> Orbos' </w> resignation

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#67:1:C>
In other words who shouted louder than who <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#68:1:B>
I think it 's a very unfair uh question to Secretary Orbos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#69:1:B>
Uh for the simple reason that uh the Secretary of Finance does not have that power uh just because even if it were true that uh there was a shouting match I don't think a cabinet secretary uh resigns simply because the Secretary of Finance shouts at him or her
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#70:1:B>
It just isn't so
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#71:1:B>
The fact of the matter is that there was never any shouting match uh in that cabinet meeting uh we had a very friendly discussion and to my mind that was one of the driest cabinet meetings that I 've ever attended so it required a wild leap of imagination for anyone to say that there was a shouting match

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#72:1:A>
You have been identified Mr Secretary as a key member of an anti-Orbos cabal that was uh supposedly whispering anti-Orbos propaganda into the President 's ear
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#73:1:A>
Would you kindly react to statements like that Mr Secretary <O> chuckle </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#74:1:B>
I think the President makes her own determination of uh the cabinet members and their performance
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#75:1:B>
She does not need anybody to tell her how a cabinet member is performing and it is not in uh the habit of various cabinet members and myself included uh to be speaking badly about uh anyone in the cabinet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#76:1:B>
As a matter of fact the President sometimes uh pulls my leg and jokes me uh as to the praises that I heap on uh the various cabinet members whenever they have something very good to present I always manage to uh say a kind word
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#77:1:B>
And so I don't ever remember having shouted at any time in the cabinet and much less uh at Secretary Orbos with whom I 've been very friendly

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#78:1:C>
Thank you Mr Secretary we 'll pause for a brief break <O> music </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#79:1:C>
Mr Secretary the resignation the forced resignation of Oscar Orbos obviously did not happen in a vacuum or in an isolated condition
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#80:1:C>
There must have been a build-up of ill-will somewhere along the line
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#81:1:C>
Would you uh <,> give us some information on what this minor or major incidents prior to the resignation may have been

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#82:1:B>
Well Tony the relationship of a cabinet member with the President is a very privileged uh relationship and I cannot pretend to know all of the details of that relationship
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#83:1:B>
It is a matter that is personal between the President and the cabinet member concerned
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#84:1:B>
What I can say however is that uh when Secretary Orbos was appointed Executive Secretary uh he certainly had the uh best uh <,> uh kindest uh thoughts from the President
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#85:1:B>
What happened since then I really do not know but uh as a member of the cabinet I can say that we have had very many discussions many suggestions for improving this and that <,> and uh I personally did not have uh too many uh disagreements with Secretary Orbos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#86:1:B>
I did give him a lot of suggestions as I suppose all the other other members of the cabinet have given the same set of suggestions but in the end it is not we uh that determine uh whether another cabinet member will resign or would tender his or her resignation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#87:1:B>
That is a matter purely between him <{> <[> and the President </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#88:1:C>
<[> And the President </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#89:1:C>
Obviously the President decides but uh uh the perception is that uh at the time that Mr Orbos was uh uh invited to the cabinet Mrs Aquino was thinking of uh uh preparing him for the presidency
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#90:1:C>
I mean he she had very good uh uh perceptions of his abilities but somehow there has been a complete change in in this uh uh image of Mr Orbos uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#91:1:B>
I 'm not sure Tony whether there has been any real complete change
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#92:1:B>
I can tell you that uh Secretary Orbos is a young man uh with a very good fresh kind of image
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#93:1:B>
And I 'm sure that it is an image that has attracted the President that has attracted me and has attracted a whole lot of people and he certainly raised uh the hopes and expectations of a whole lot of people 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#94:1:B>
Uh what happened since again there uh it can be a matter of speculation but probably this is a matter that will be best left to Secretary Orbos and the President

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#95:1:C>
Okay I 'll not press you anymore <,> <O> laughter </O> 

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#96:1:D>
Let 's go back to this famous meeting at which he was supposed to have shouted louder than Secretary Orbos or vice versa
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#97:1:D>
This meeting at which the levy and the rollback of prices were discussed presumably were not the only meetings at which these subjects were discussed <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#98:1:D>
What was the <,,> participation of the other members of the cabinet in this and did you get the sense that that majority of the cabinet is behind taking a firm stand on this <,> movement and this agitation for uh <,> a substantial cut in the levy and a rollback of oil prices

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#99:1:B>
Rudy as you know we have uh a small group within the cabinet that uh takes lunch with the President on Mondays
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#100:1:B>
And it was on that Monday for the week that uh Secretary Orbos tendered his resignation when uh there was some discussion about uh gasoline prices oil prices import levy and I remember very distinctly that uh there was no disagreement over principle
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-042#101:1:B>
Uh Secretary Orbos has been in favor of the cut-down of the import levy and I 'm on record as being in favor of the phasing down of the import levy 

 </I>
