<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#3:1>
ONE day last week, Amy Lecciones asked her staff to do research on
biodiversity for her organization 's upcoming seminar for environmental
groups in Davao City next week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#4:1>
The seminar is just a few days away, but surprisingly, the
staffers of the Philippine Sustainable Development Network, a
non-governmental organization, did not look worried at all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#5:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Normally, research work on this takes weeks to
months, &rdquo; </quote> said Amy, who is the PSDN 's program coordinator.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#6:1>
She explained that to do so, she used to send some of her staff to
the best libraries of Metro Manila to look for the latest journals and books
on the topic.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#7:1>
Or, they made phone calls or sent fax messages to other organizations
or academic institutions - - many of them abroad - - which are also
interested in the topic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#8:1>
Today, the scenario has become very different ever since the PSDN
got connected to the Internet over a year ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#9:1>
Enter Vic Reyes, PSDN 's resident computer geek and Internet
expert. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#10:1>
Vic typed in the word <mention> &ldquo; biodiversity &rdquo;
</mention> in his computer, which was already hooked up to the Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#11:1>
A few seconds later, his computer screen showed several possible
locations where to get the documents - - mostly from computerized libraries
of universities and those of environmental groups and agencies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#12:1>
Vic browsed through the available documents and saved to his
computer 's hard disk the ones his organization needed.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#13:1>
From one computer site in the United States, he then moved on to
another location. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#14:1>
Before I could count to five, he was already in another &ldquo;
virtual library &rdquo; in Australia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#15:1>
After getting some documents, he went to another site somewhere in
Europe, then back to the US again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#16:1>
In short, he was virtually travelling around the world at what
seemed like the speed of light, finding the documents he needed and bringing
them right to his office as fast as Superman could do it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; All in all, it took me less than 10 minutes to
retrieve these five documents, &rdquo; </quote> Vic said, showing me the
printed copies of the materials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#18:1>
Weeks or even months of work was done in just 10 minutes, with
just a few keystrokes or clicks of the computer mouse. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#19:1>
<h> <bold> What is the Internet? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#20:1>
The Internet goes by different names.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#21:1>
It is sometimes called simply as <mention> &ldquo; The net, &rdquo;
</mention> or <mention> &ldquo; Information Superhighway, &rdquo; </mention>
<mention> &ldquo; Cyberspace, &rdquo; </mention> <mention> <foreign> &ldquo;
Infobahn &rdquo; </foreign> </mention> and many others.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#22:1>
But what really is the Internet? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#23:1>
The book <mention> &ldquo; The Internet for Dummies &rdquo;
</mention> by John R. Levine and Carol Baroudi defines it as <quote> &ldquo;
the world 's largest computer network. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#24:1>
Nowadays, computers are quite popular in Philippine offices,
schools and in some homes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#25:1>
When these computers are connected to each other so they could
exchange information - - through cables, telephone wires, satellite links or
through whatever medium - - they form what is called a <mention> &ldquo;
network. &rdquo; </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#26:1>
Take the case of automated teller machines.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#27:1>
Because ATMs are actually computers that communicate with other
machines - - even those in far away places - - a depositor can withdraw money
in Zamboanga while on a business trip although his bank account is in Manila.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#28:1>
Now, think of thousands of computer networks - - large and small,
from all over the world - - combined all together, exchanging data with each
other.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#29:1>
That is the Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#30:1>
That 's why others call it <mention> <quote> &ldquo; the network of
all networks &rdquo; </quote> </mention> or <mention> <quote> &ldquo; the
mother of all networks. &rdquo; </quote> </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#31:1>
To date, there are about 40,000 of these networks with about 40
million users the world over. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#32:1>
<h> <bold> What 's in it for you? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#33:1>
The Internet may sound so technical, as if only computer geeks
like Vic of PSDN can make it work for them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#34:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But virtually everybody can benefit from it, both
the techie types and the non-technical ones, &rdquo; </quote> stressed Kelsey
Hartigan-Go of De La Salle University 's computer services center. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#35:1>
Navigating the Internet now has become so easy and user-friendly
that people who use it say they are <quote> &ldquo; surfing the Internet,"
</quote> referring to how leisurely it is to cruise along the Information
Superhighways. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#36:1>
No wonder even children, nuns and many other mortals get so
addicted to it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#37:1>
Let 's take a look at what the Net has to offer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#38:1>
Its primary function is communication - - mainly through
electronic mail, or e-mail for short. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#39:1>
With e-mail, your letters can reach their destinations almost
instantly, perhaps within a few seconds to a few minutes - - even to
locations on the opposite site of the globe.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#40:1>
In contrast, how long can your &ldquo; snail-mail &rdquo; ( sent via
post office or a private forwarding company) reach its destination? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#41:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If you still do not have an e-mail address two
years from now, you 'll be classified as a dinosaur, &rdquo; </quote> said
Jim Ayson, one of the acknowledged local Internet experts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#42:1>
Of course, the Internet cannot totally eliminate the traditional
mailing system, telephone calls and fax transmissions - - but it can transmit
messages at significantly reduced costs and with far better efficiency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#43:1>
You can actually &ldquo; talk &rdquo; using the Internet,
conversing in real time with another person who is on the opposite side of
the globe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#44:1>
Chatting in Cyberspace, though, is still mainly done by typing
words on the keyboard instead of saying them aloud.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#45:1>
But with the recent introduction of the Internet phone and similar
computer programs, you can do away with long distance telephone bills soon.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#46:1>
Internet videophone is also around the corner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#47:1>
For researchers like Amy and Vic, the Internet is heaven on
earth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#48:1>
Thousands and thousands of offices and agencies - - including the
libraries of Harvard University - - have made millions of documents available
on the Internet, free for everyone to read or retrieve. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#49:1>
To make life simpler, some guys on the Internet have devised
search tools, like the Lycos program Vic used.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#50:1>
Just by using keywords, one is led to potential locations where to
find documents on a certain topic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#51:1>
Think of about any topic you want to search on - - from kitchen
menus to video clips of a rocket launch - - and you can definitely find it on
the Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#52:1>
It 's just a matter of mastering your way around. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#53:1>
With the advent of the World Wide Web, which is a systematic way
of linking one database to another, searching for information has become even
easier and much more fun. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#54:1>
Aside from documents, millions of computer programs can also be
&ldquo; downloaded &rdquo; ( copied from computers in faraway places right to
your own PC) for free.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#55:1>
They are either <mention> &ldquo; freeware &rdquo; </mention> (
absolutely free) or <mention> &ldquo; shareware, &rdquo; </mention> which is
free for you to evaluate for a certain period, but which you must register
and pay for once you have decided to use it for a long period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#56:1>
The Internet is not all work.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#57:1>
There are also lots of fun out there - - games, gossip and yes, even
&ldquo; cyber sex. &rdquo; </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#61:2>
THE Internet started in 1969 as a United States military project
during the Cold War, then called <mention> ARPAnet </mention> , being managed
by the Advanced Research Projects Administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#62:2>
It was mainly an experiment on how to put up a reliable computer
network over long distances - - using high-speed telephone lines - - so it
can resist enemy attack.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#63:2>
It also served as a link between the military and their contractors,
including some universities doing military-related research. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#64:2>
The ARPAnet was so successful that soon, most universities wanted
to be part of it.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#65:2>
Over the years, more and more civilian use were integrated into the
network.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#66:2>
Quickly, its reach spanned the globe, and was later called the
<mention> Internet </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#67:2>
The ARPAnet technology proved to be so reliable, largely due to
&ldquo; dynamic rerouting, &rdquo; a system wherein if one of the network
links were disrupted - - say by an enemy attack - - data transmitted through
it were automatically rerouted through other links. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#68:2>
To illustrate how reliable it is, here 's an excerpt from the
best-selling book <mention> &ldquo; The Internet for Dummies &rdquo;
</mention> : <X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#X69:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Can the Internet really resist enemy attack?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#X70:2>
It looks that way.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#X71:2>
During the Gulf War in 1991, the US military had considerable
trouble knocking out the Iraqi command network.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#X72:2>
It turned out that the Iraqis were using commercially available
network routers with standard Internet routing and recovery technology.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#X73:2>
In other words, dynamic rerouting worked.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#X74:2>
It 's nice to know that dynamic rerouting works, although perhaps
this was not the most opportune way to find out. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#75:2>
<h> <bold> Internet in the Philippines </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#76:2>
In the Philippines, the first concerted effort to connect to the
Internet started in mid-1993 when the Department of Science and Technology
initiated the formation of the Philippine Network Foundation Inc. ( PFI) to
study the possibility of establishing a national network with access to the
Internet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#77:2>
It was to be called <mention> PHnet </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#78:2>
A month later, in July, the DOST facilitated a dial-up access (
that is, calling overseas via long distance) for the leading academic
institutions via the Victoria University of Technology of Australia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#79:2>
Then, in March 1994, the DOST got a dedicated leased line direct
to the US, thus negating the need to dial long distance to connect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#80:2>
Initially, 10 institutions had direct access to the Internet via
leased line connection.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#81:2>
Aside from the DOST, these are the Ateneo de Manila University, De La
Salle University, University of the Philippines in Diliman, UP Los
Ba&ntilde;os, University of Sto. Tomas, the Industrial Research Foundation,
St. Louis University in Baguio, University of San Carlos in Cebu and Xavier
University in Cagayan de Oro City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#82:2>
Connected later to the PHnet were Mosaic Communications
Philippines ( a commercial Internet service provider), DOST 's Advanced
Science and Technology Institute at UP Diliman, Mindanao State
University-Iligan Institute of Technology, the Asian Institute of Management
and, a few weeks ago, UP Manila. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#83:2>
This year, in Metro Manila alone, at least eight more commercial
Internet access providers bloomed, each getting their Internet connections
independent from PHnet, some with much faster capability. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#84:2>
Geographically, Juan de la Cruz can now access the Internet
without need to call long distance in Metro Manila, Baguio, Los Ba&ntilde;os,
Cebu, Cagayan de Oro and Iligan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#85:2>
But anybody from any part of the country with a direct distance
dialing telephone system can actually connect to the Internet, although at
much added expense. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#86:2>
Expansion is now under way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#87:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We intend to bring the Internet to the key cities
of all regions of the country, &rdquo; </quote> said Risa Carlos of PFI.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#88:2>
This may be realized with the third phase of PFI 's project to wire
the Philippines, she added, when its new leased line becomes operational by
the end of October.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#89:2>
PFI 's new line will have four times the capacity of its existing
line.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#90:2>
The long list of applicants for leased lines will then be granted
access. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#91:2>
A commercial ISP which currently has the largest capacity,
Sequel.Net, will also make the Internet accessible in Davao by October, and
in Subic Bay in Olongapo and Clark in Angeles before the end of the year,
according to company spokesman Bobby Roldan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#92:2>
And trials on accessing the Internet through VHF and UHF radio is
now under way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#93:2>
Compared to many countries, the Philippines ventured into
Cyberspace quite late.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#94:2>
But Internet experts Jim Ayson and Kelsey Hartigan-Go noted the
&ldquo; very fast &rdquo; growth of Netsurfers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#95:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Judging by developments in the past few months,
we 're definitely catching up with our neighboring countries, &rdquo;
</quote> said PFI 's Carlos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#96:2>
Ayson pointed out that we may, by now, even be at par with leader
Hong Kong when it comes to the number of ISPs.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#97:2>
Ayson was quick to note, however, that the Philippines is still in
its <quote> &ldquo; infancy stage &rdquo; </quote> when it comes to tapping
the Internet as an information tool. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#98:2>
<quote> &ldquo; There is still a lot of work to do in educating
the public, &rdquo; </quote> Ayson said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#99:2>
&ldquo; When you look at the global Cyberspace, the Philippines
is the equivalent of a back hole in the universe, &rdquo; </quote> said Vic
Reyes of the Philippine Sustainable Development Network.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#100:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We get so much information from it, but nothing goes
out from us. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#101:2>
<h> <bold> More participation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#102:2>
Reyes implies that to be part of the global information village,
the Philippines should make its information available to the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#103:2>
So far, there are some Filipino-oriented &ldquo; home pages &rdquo;
in the World Wide Web - - which serves as a sort of &ldquo; show room &rdquo;
for companies, organizations or individuals in the Internet - - but most of
these are maintained by Filipinos abroad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#104:2>
In fact, one of those home pages called <mention> &ldquo; Cyber
<indig> bayan </indig> , &rdquo; </mention> supposed to be the Filipinos '
home in Cyberspace, is maintained by an American. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#105:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Seems like we still have a lot to do to convince
government agencies to make their information online, &rdquo; </quote> he
added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#106:2>
But even before going to that stage, there is still one major
problem that hounds potential Internet users in the Philippines - - the lack
of telephone lines.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#107:2>
Data gathered by the Center for Telecommunications Studies show that
phone density in the Philippines is at a low 1.667 per 100 households.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#108:2>
It even goes to as low as .207 in the Bicol Region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#109:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The growth of the Internet depends on the
telecommunications industry, &rdquo; </quote> Hartigan-Go said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#110:2>
Also, the rates being offered by local Internet service
providers as of now are still expensive, at least compared to those in the
United States, noted Ayson.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#111:2>
Average fee for a 12-hour access in a month ( so short for a serious
user) is about &peso;800, and about &peso;75 per extra hour used.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#112:2>
Some ISPs offer it at just &peso;600 a month for 30 hours, but you
have to pay one year in advance to enjoy this discounted rate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#113:2>
Compare that to the &dollar;20 ( about &peso;500) with unlimited
access time offered by some US companies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-040#114:2>
Next week, we 'll discuss the equipment and the steps you need
to take to finally hook up to the Internet. </p> </I>
