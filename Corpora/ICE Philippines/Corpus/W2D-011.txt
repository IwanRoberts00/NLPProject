<quote> &ldquo; It 's actually a cross between a fountain and a
flower arrangement, &rdquo; </quote> says Jerome de Jesus of <mention>
Portofino </mention> , a family-owned company specializing in interior design
and landscapes ( tels. 933-6275 or 933-6224).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#9:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But, it can also pass as a dish garden arrangement.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#10:1>
A decorative object in its own right, this indoor fountain makes
a welcome accessory for the living room.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#11:1>
It can be arranged as a table centerpiece or as an accent piece for
the side tables.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#12:1>
Some people even place it in their foyer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#13:1>
If you create this fountain yourself, it will cost you a little
less than if you buy one from a garden shop or an appliance store.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#14:1>
A small fountain costs &peso;3,000-6,000.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#15:1>
If you make your own, Jerome says, you 'll spend less than
&peso;1,500. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#16:1>
To begin the process, you will need a basin or a dish for the
fountain.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#17:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It can be any container [ metal, plastic, ceramic,
stoneware or clay pots] as long as it doesn't leak, &rdquo; </quote> warns
Jerome.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#18:1>
Or, you can buy commercially available <foreign> ikebana </foreign>
dish at any Japanese grocery store for &peso;500-600. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#19:1>
You will also need river stones and metamorphic rocks ( or
sedimentary rocks) for this craft.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#20:1>
These stones can be purchased from any garden shop for &peso;250 or
less per drum.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#21:1>
Choose stones with smooth edges.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#22:1>
If you 're living in the province or if you 're going to the beach,
you can pick up some good stones along the way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#23:1>
Choose a low-capacity water pump for this arrangement.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#24:1>
Actually, there are different types of water pumps in the market, but
if you 're using a small dish, you don't need a high-powered pump.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#25:1>
A low-capacity &ldquo; power head &rdquo; water pump may cost
&peso;500-600 at <mention> True Value </mention> and other pet shops. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#26:1>
<h> <bold> Floral art </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#27:1>
Flowers and plants play a big role in this art piece.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#28:1>
Choose plants that will thrive on low light and can live in water,
such as fortune plants, dracaenas or any water plant.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#29:1>
For a unique appeal, Jerome suggests variegated water plants like the
striped corn plants ( shown in pictures).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's nice to have leaves with patterns or white
specks to make it look interesting. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#31:1>
Make sure the roots are free from soil so as not to clog the pump.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#32:1>
If you have a big dish, you can put driftwood or small pots as
accessories. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#33:1>
Other tools needed: PVC ( polyvinyl chloride) pipe available at
all hardware shops for &peso;20 or less; a small basket or an ordinary
strainer to isolate the stones from the pump ( to avoid overheating); a
bamboo tube and a cutter.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#34:1>
The bamboo tube is utilized only to cover the PVC pipe to perfectly
suit and blend with the landscape.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#35:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Actually, this is a kind of landscaping except that
it is contained in a small dish, &rdquo; </quote> says Jerome.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#36:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But the elements of a common landscape are all here,
such as water, stones and plants. &rdquo; </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#37:1>
There is no hard and fast rule in arranging the stones, plants
and water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#38:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Unlike the Japanese <foreign> Zen </foreign> that
follows certain guidelines in flower arrangement, this particular craft is
simply a matter of filling up an empty space.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#39:1>
It 's free-style decoration. &rdquo; </quote> </p> <&> Pictures
accompany the following instructions. </&>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#40:1>
1. PREPARE the dish of your choice.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#41:1>
2. POSITION the water pump at the center of the dish.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#42:1>
3. INSERT the 5-inch PVC pipe into the mouth of the pump.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#43:1>
4. COVER with plastic basket to isolate the pump from the stones.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#44:1>
5.-6. EQUALLY distribute the stones to conceal the basket.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#45:1>
7. ARRANGE the metamorphic stones in different angles or on top of
each other.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#46:1>
8. AS part of the accent, insert the bamboo tube into the PVC pipe.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#47:1>
9. CUT flowers according to desired height.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#48:1>
10. FILL it up with water up to the edge of the container.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#49:1>
Make sure the pump is fully submerged in water.

<h> <bold> Another do-it-yourself fountain </bold> </h>

<bold> BY VANGIE BAGA-REYES </bold>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#54:2>
<bold> PHOTOS BY ROGER CARPIO </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#55:2>
TWO months ago, <mention> Lifestyle </mention> featured a
stunning easy-to-make indoor tabletop fountain.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#56:2>
The response from readers was overwhelming, especially through
e-mail.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#57:2>
Many of them have tried it at home and given away their creations as
presents to friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#58:2>
Others have even started small businesses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#59:2>
With this kind of feedback, we thought of featuring another
exquisite design for desktop fountains called <mention> Euro-fountain
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#60:2>
<quote> &ldquo; This homemade self-contained fountain will always
give a soft, gentle mood, &rdquo; </quote> says interior designer and
landscape artist Jerome de Jesus of <mention> Portofino </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#61:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Nothing beats water trickling down a wall and into a
basin and creating a soothing, gurgling sound. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#62:2>
Streams and waterfalls inspired De Jesus to create this
enchanting fountain, which provides the perfect touch to a European- or
Mediterranean-type of living room.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#63:2>


<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#64:2>
Making this fountain will cost you less than what you would pay
for a relatively small fountain in garden shops or appliance stores.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#65:2>
A homemade fountain costs &peso;l,500 while a commercial one sells
for &peso;2,000 to &peso;5,000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#66:2>
You will need a basin or a garden planter for the fountain.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#67:2>
<quote> &ldquo; It can be any container [ made of clay pots, metal,
plastic, <foreign> terracotta </foreign> , ceramic or stoneware] as long as
it does not leak, &rdquo; </quote> says De Jesus.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#68:2>
Paint the container white to make it look elegant and attractive.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#69:2>
For the centerpiece, any resin wall <foreign> d&eacute;cor
</foreign> , hollow inside and with intricate design, will do.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#70:2>
Drill holes on top of this <foreign> d&eacute;cor </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#71:2>
The trajectory of the water depends on how big or small the holes
are.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#72:2>
The smaller the holes the higher the water will flow out.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#73:2>
Start with small holes until you get your desired diameter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#74:2>
You will need white pebbles, which can be purchased at any garden
shop for &peso;50 a kilo or less. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#75:2>
Choose a medium-capacity water pump for this arrangement.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#76:2>
Although there are different types of water pumps in the market, you
don't need a high-powered pump if you 're using a small dish.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#77:2>
A medium-capacity &ldquo; power head &rdquo; water pump may cost
&peso;700 at <mention> True Value </mention> and pet shops. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#78:2>
Flowers and plants play a big role in this art piece.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#79:2>
Choose plants that can thrive in low light and survive in water, such
as fortune plants or dracaenas.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#80:2>
Make sure the roots have been cleaned of soil so as not to clog the
pump. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#81:2>
Other tools needed are PVC ( polyvinyl chloride) pipe available
in all hardware shops for &peso;20 or less, a small basket or an ordinary
strainer to keep the stones away from the pump ( and avoid overheating) and
all-purpose adhesive. <&> Pictures accompany the instructions given below.
</&>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#82:2>
1. DRILL holes on top of the wall <foreign> d&eacute;cor </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#83:2>
2. DRILL a larger hole at the back ( lower portion) of the <foreign>
d&eacute;cor </foreign> and affix a one-inch PVC pipe.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#84:2>
3. PUT a small amount of pebbles in the container.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#85:2>
4. PLACE the pump at the middle.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#86:2>
5. COVER with a plastic basket to keep the stones away from the pump.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#87:2>
6. INSERT the PVC pipe into the pump nozzle.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#88:2>
Position the <foreign> d&eacute;cor </foreign> at the center of the
container.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#89:2>
7. ADD more pebbles, making sure the basket is completely concealed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#90:2>
8. SLIP in the plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#91:2>
9. FILL up with water up to the edge of the container.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#92:2>
Make sure the pump is fully submerged in water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#93:2>
10. TABLE-TOP fountain enhances the serenity of your private garden
or room with the soothing sounds and relaxing motion of water.

ALL brides are beautiful.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#99:3>
They glow and exude an aura of sheer happiness as they walk down the
aisle to keep a date in the altar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#100:3>
It 's the bride 's day and all eyes will definitely be on her.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#101:3>
So naturally, the bride wants to capture this once-in-a-lifetime joy
in photos.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#102:3>
She has to be picture-perfect.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#103:3>
Will she get her wish? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#104:3>
Not always, says hair and makeup artist Ricky Reyes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#105:3>
<quote> &ldquo; This is a common mistake among makeup artists
who do bridal makeup, &rdquo; </quote> explains Ricky.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#106:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Indeed, the bride may look beautiful in person, but
if the makeup is not correctly done, the photos will reveal otherwise - - the
concealer around the eyes may be so white that it disfigures the face; the
foundation may be too oily; the blusher may be too red.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#107:3>
These may not be obvious in person, but the photos will show the
truth. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#108:3>
Choosing a good makeup artist is the key.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#109:3>
Reyes, for instance, has developed <mention> Bridal Creative Teams
</mention> to take care of the beauty needs of the bride from the time the
hair is set and the makeup is applied, to the time that she is celebrating
with guests at the reception.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#110:3>
The Ricky Reyes Bridal Creative Teams ( call 721-7705 or 723-5440)
is also trained to put the headpieces, veils and jewelry properly, re-touch
the makeup, and do last-minute repairs on the hairstyle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#111:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The bride can relax and not think of any beauty
disaster.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#112:3>
The Bridal Creative Team will be by her side, &rdquo; </quote> Reyes
says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#113:3>
To help the bride avoid beauty mishaps that are clearly visible
in photos, Reyes shares how common mistakes can be remedied: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#114:3>
<h> <bold> Wrong type of foundation. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#115:3>
The tropical heat easily makes the foundation meld with the skin.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#116:3>
Using the wrong foundation may prove disastrous.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#117:3>
Reyes advises that for those with dry skin, creme foundation is
perfect.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#118:3>
The oily type should go for the cake foundation.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#119:3>
Failure to blend well the foundation may result in exposed laugh
lines.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#120:3>
Make sure that the foundation used on this area of the face is one
shade lighter.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#121:3>
Never forget to blend well the foundation applied on the neck and
ears.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#122:3>
Do not overuse the concealer, too.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#123:3>
You wouldn't want to look like a raccoon! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#124:3>
<h> <bold> Too much blusher. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#125:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Brides must be queens and not mannequins, &rdquo;
</quote> Reyes says.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#126:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Putting too much blusher will make them look like
Raggedy Anns.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#127:3>
Brides with soft supple skin can in fact do away with blusher for
that more natural look. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<quote> &ldquo; You will notice in some photos how the lips of the
bride dominate her whole face.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#130:3>
That is because the lipstick used was too red.

The bride need not catch attention by putting on very red lipstick

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#134:3>
Colors and degree of application vary according to the time of the
day.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-011#135:3>
Morning weddings require light makeup.

Highlighting the eyebrow and the eyelashes give life to any makeup.

However, some makeup artists do not know how to choose the right
length of lashes for the bride.
