<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#3:1>
In the past, the Pasig River was one of the most captivating
tributaries to watch.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#4:1>
In fact, it was once touted as <mention> &ldquo; the Venice of the
East. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#5:1>
The river was so beguiling that it captivated the heart of Dr. Jose
Rizal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#6:1>
In his European travelogue in 1886, he thought of Pasig River while
cruising along the Rhine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#7:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The Rhine is beautiful, &rdquo; </quote> he wrote,
<quote> &ldquo; it reminds one of the Pasig of my native land, and proudly I
think that if the Pasig had on its banks more beautiful buildings, it would
only envy the Rhine for its long course and abundant waters. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#8:1>
Paradoxically, it was the country 's foremost hero who was the
first one to document the first stages of the river 's despoliation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#9:1>
Upon his return in Manila in 1887, he noted: <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#10:1>
Rizal did not live long to shower the river with more of his
verses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#11:1>
While it has been the subject of poets before, the Pasig is now the
object of environmentalists ' apprehension. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#12:1>
A study conducted by the Danish International Development Agency
( Danida) found the historic river dead - biologically.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#13:1>
Unless drastic rehabilitation is done, the river will vanish like the
extinct <foreign> <it> esteros </it> </foreign> and tributaries that once
branched out of it, the study concluded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#14:1>
Too much sludge and pollution have made organic life impossible
in the Pasig River.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#15:1>
The Danida study found dissolved oxygen ( DO) to be only one
milligram per liter in some parts of the river, even plummeting to zero at
certain points. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#16:1>
The biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD) - the oxygen in the water
required by aerobic bacteria to dissolve all organic matter thrown in the
river - is measured at 350 tons.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#17:1>
But the virtual absence of oxygen in the Pasig River makes it
impossible for the aerobic bacteria to dissolve the debris thrown in the
river. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#18:1>
<quote> &ldquo; This oxygen deficiency is the main cause of the
offensive odor and the absence of biological life in the river," </quote>
observe one Filipino environmentalist. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#19:1>
The Pasig River lies between two huge bodies of water, the Laguna
Lake on the southeast and the Manila Bay on the northwestern end.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#20:1>
It oscillates from lake to bay with the ebb and flow of the tide.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#21:1>
Since Manila is known to have a mixed tide, the Pasig flows twice
daily towards the direction of the bay and the same number of times towards
the opposite direction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#22:1>
The word <mention> <indig> <it> pasig </it> </indig> </mention>
literally means <mention> &ldquo; riverside. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#23:1>
This redundance of the name Pasig River came from folklore.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#24:1>
Old folks say an officer, standing at a river had asked one of the
natives that name of the place.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#25:1>
The native logically said it was <mention> &ldquo; Pasig &rdquo;
</mention> ( shortened form of <mention> <indig> <it> dalampasigan </it>
</indig> </mention> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#26:1>
Obviously, what he really meant was that the man was standing on the
riverside.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#27:1>
Henceforth, it was called <mention> <foreign> <it> Rio de Pasig </it>
</foreign> </mention> in explorers ' maps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#28:1>
Stretching 25 kilometers from Manila Bay in the west to Laguna de
Bay in the east, the Pasig River and its tributaries provided a viable mode
of inland transportation to the early settlers of Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#29:1>
At the height of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, the mouth of the
river served as a veritable transport point of goods coming from the Middle
East and other Asian countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#30:1>
Tales were told of the river teeming with life and blessing the
river folk with freshwater bounties, and clean, fresh water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#31:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The river showed off its bounty around the 1940s
when, being relatively unpolluted, it generously flowed for people to wash
clothes and take a bath in, for poets to admire, and for fishermen to take
home a bountiful catch, &rdquo; recalled Dr. Macrina ZafaralIa in her study
<mention> <it> Pasig: The Ecology of a Dying River </it> </mention> . </p>

<p> <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#32:1>
This was in the past.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#33:1>
As Manila developed with the imperatives of urbanization, industrial
establishments conveniently mushroomed along both sides of the fabled river.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#34:1>
Subsequent events tell of the usual path taken by all rivers that
have witnessed the growth of great cities adjacent to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#35:1>
<quote> &ldquo; With time, the river became an overused artery of
commercial and industrial pursuits," </quote> Dr. Zafaralla noted in her
study. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#X36:1>
<quote> &ldquo; In the 1960s, the water shimmered in oily squalor.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#X37:1>
Thereafter, water from artesian wells dug along the banks became
unpotable for human consumption.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#X38:1>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#41:1>
The degraded state of the river had never before been more
unbearable," </quote> deplored the professor who studied for her doctorate in
environmental science at the University of the Philippines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#42:1>
Today, the river is totally polluted.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#43:1>
In the Philippine context, pollution means <quote> &ldquo; any
alteration of the properties of a resource which renders the latter harmful
or injurious to public health, safety and welfare, or which adversely affects
its intended use. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#44:1>
At all times, Pasig is <quote> &ldquo; extremely turbid and
black," </quote> according to the Philippine Environmental Action Network, a
non-government organization which engages in direct community action and
develops sustainable development alternatives.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#45:1>
But it <quote> &ldquo; gets to its worst condition during the dry
season when shallow currents expose black decomposing waste which releases
odorous gases, including hydrogen sulfide, &rdquo; </quote> it added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#46:1>
Government classifies the Pasig River as a Class C body of water,
one intended for the <quote> &ldquo; propagation and growth of fish and other
aquatic resources. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#47:1>
Waters classified as A and AA are usable as public water supply,
B for swimming and other forms of recreation, D for agriculture and
industries, while E is limited for navigation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#48:1>
A feasibility study conducted in 1990-91 by the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources with funding from Danida disclosed that
pollution in the 24 kilometer waterway is composed of 45 percent liquid
industrial waste, another 45 percent from liquid domestic waste, and the
remaining ten percent from solid domestic waste.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#49:1>
Solid waste refers to garbage from households, companies, schools,
businesses, hospitals and laboratories. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#50:1>
Over 2,000 industries within Metro Manila, the study found,
discharge their pollutants into the river, and some 12,800 squatter families
dwell along the river 's banks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#51:1>
Another study showed that Metro Manila dumps at least 1,500 tons
of refuse daily into the Pasig River.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#52:1>
The industrial firms and factories along its banks dump about 12.5
million gallons per year of untreated industrial waste water. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; It 's not too late yet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#54:1>
We can bring the Pasig River back to life." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#55:1>
This is the assertion of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Program (
PRRP), a comprehensive government project to revive the fabled river
immortalized by Dr. Jose Rizal in his travelogues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#56:1>
The PRRP strategic program has a target period of 10-15 years,
with an estimated cost of over &peso;10billion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#57:1>
Although there have been efforts in the past to rehabilitate the
river, many of these previous attempts were not successful.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#58:1>
Former First Lady Imelda Marcos, for instance, fantasized of
transforming the polluted river into the country 's newest tourist
attraction, with floating restaurants, casinos, and shopping malls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#59:1>
Former President Corazon Aquino also vowed to restore the dying
river before the six-year-term expired.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#60:1>
Her vision did not materialize. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#61:1>
This time, it is the turn of First Lady Amelita &ldquo; Ming
&rdquo; Ramos to save the river from total annihilation.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#62:1>
She has adopted it as one of her priority projects under the Clean
and Green Program. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#63:1>
Acting in her private capacity, the First Lady convened
non-governmental organizations and government agencies, with the help of the
Green Coalition chaired by Senator Orlando S. Mercado, to further narrow the
gaps in the various efforts to save the Pasig River. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#64:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The centuries have not been kind to this great
river," </quote> noted Mrs. Ramos. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#X65:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Today, the Pasig River is on the verge of dying.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#X66:1>
Its hue is the color of mourning, its odor the stench of despair.
</X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#67:1>
It is not yet too late to reverse the errors of the past, &rdquo;
</quote> she said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#68:1>
This led to the creation of the <indig> Sagip </indig> Pasig
Movement ( SPM),which was established as key coordinator of government, NGO
and private sector efforts.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#69:1>
Its aim is to generate the environmental awareness necessary to
encourage community participation in the rehabilitation effort. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#70:1>
The SPM participates in the work of the Presidential Task Force
through its two member organizations: the Green Coalition, representing NGOs;
and the Philippine Business for Environment, representing the business
sector.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#71:1>
The PRRP Secretariat sits in the steering committee of the SPM to
ensure a close link between their activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#72:1>
For its part, the Metro Manila Authority gave its own
contribution to the cause by conducting Waterways Sanitation Services ( WSS)
and the <indig> &ldquo; Oplan Pasiglahin ang Ilog Pasig. &rdquo; </indig>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#73:1>
Manila Representative Ramon Bagatsing, Jr., on the other hand,
endorsed <indig> &ldquo; Sagipin ang Ilog Pasig &rdquo; </indig> to
rehabilitate the moribund Pasig River.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#74:1>
In his House Bill No. 1130, he urged for the creation of a council
that includes the chairman of the Metro Manila Development Authority ( MMDA),
the mayors of Manila, Pasig, Pateros and Makati, a representative each from
the two chambers of Congress, the Secretary of the Department of Environment
and Natural Resources ( DENR), the Philippine Coast Guard, and three
representatives from non-governmental organizations ( NGOs). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#75:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It will take three presidential terms to save
Pasig," </quote> explained Ms. Ramos during the launching of the <indig> <it>
Piso Para Sa Pasig </it> </indig> ( PPP) in October 1995.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#76:1>
PPP is an ambitious endeavor created to tackle the herculean task of
cleaning-up and rehabilitating the country 's most famed river. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#77:1>
The PPP was conceptualized by the Clean and Green Foundation,
River Rehabilitation Secretariat of the environment department, the Center
for Corporate Citizenship of the Philippine Business for Social Progress, the
Philippine Business for the Environment and the <indig> Sagip </indig> Pasig
Movement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#78:1>
The goal of PPP is <quote> &ldquo; to ensure the continuity of
Pasig-related projects even after the present administration, &rdquo;
</quote> stressed Ms. Ramos, who chairs the PPP campaign board. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#79:1>
Part of PPP 's activities is a fund-raising drive to put up a
&peso;50 million trust fund for private sector projects to rehabilitate the
river. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#80:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Your help, even if it is as little as a peso,
will see the Pasig Waterfront Development Project of the PPP to completion,
&rdquo; </quote> said its officials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#81:1>
The contributions collected will help build a Roxas Boulevard
Riverside Park, where donors will have their names inscribed on a specially
constructed wall.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#82:1>
In addition, a Pasig River &ldquo; Walk of Fame &rdquo; with patrons '
names will be etched along the 1.3 kilometers easement - - from Roxas Bridge
to the MET theater. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#83:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If we all do our share, we may soon see the Pasig
River reborn, &rdquo; </quote> said the PPP officials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#84:1>
Meanwhile, some business sectors gamely responded to the call of
the First Lady in helping revive the river.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#85:1>
One of them is Eduardo Manuel, president of Starcraft Corporation and
South Sea Drive and Travel Supply, Inc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#86:1>
Manuel believes the river can be resurrected by making it a route
for ferry boats.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#87:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The shuttle ferry services, dubbed as Pasig River
Ferry 2000, would provide a cheaper, faster and convenient alternative to
commuters," </quote> Manuel explained.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#88:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There 's big business for this project, but it is not
really the business we 're after.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#89:1>
We also want to provide the public with a more comfortable and faster
means of transportation, &rdquo; </quote> he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#90:1>
The amount to be donated by the Pasig River Ferry 2000 could make
StarCraft the single biggest PPP contributor.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; A peso for every passenger will be donated to the
First Lady 's project, &rdquo; </quote> he averred.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#92:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If we can seat a million passengers a month, then, we 'll
be able to contribute at least &peso;1 million regularly to the project,
&rdquo; </quote> Manuel said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#93:1>
He added that the proposed ferry - - which would cost
&peso;400million to build - - will utilize airconditioned, locally-assembled,
high-speed boats using state-of-the-art Japanese technology. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#94:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Once again, we are turning to the historic Pasig
River as an alternative route to ease the massive traffic problem in Metro
Manila, &rdquo; </quote> Manuel pointed out... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#95:1>
Meanwhile, multi-awarded science journalist Ernesto Lawagan said
no amount of dredging and cleaning would work in the Pasig River unless the
following are implemented:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#96:1>
* Stopping industrial pollution through strict implementation of
pollution control laws.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#97:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It must be made compulsory for industrial firms and
factories to build pollution control treatment plans conforming to strict
control standards, &rdquo; </quote> he said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#98:1>
* Stopping domestic pollution through strict implementation of health
and sanitation laws.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#99:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Direct waste and garbage disposal into rivers and
creeks must be prohibited, &rdquo; </quote> Lawagan suggested.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#100:1>
* Reforestation of denuded areas of neighboring and surrounding
provinces.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#101:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Trees as we know prevent soil erosion which is
another major culprit in the siltation and shallowing of rivers and lakes,
&rdquo; </quote> he pointed out.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#102:1>
* Dismantling of all establishments, notwithstanding the permanence
of the structures or the influence of the people involved, who do not conform
to the easement requirements of the Public Land Act and the Civil Code.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#103:1>
* Establishing a sufficient number of sewage treatment plants in and
around Manila to stop direct inflow of solid wastes into the river.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-029#104:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Recycling plants, &rdquo; </quote> Lawagan said,
<quote> &ldquo; are also viable and feasible and could even be used for
garbage and non-biodegradable refuse. &rdquo; </quote> </p> </I>
