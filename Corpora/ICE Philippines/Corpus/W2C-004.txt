<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#3:1>
Senate President <foreign> Pro Tempore </foreign> Blas Ople
recommended yesterday the use of what he called the <mention> &ldquo; Peru
formula &rdquo; </mention> in dealing with the insurgency problems posed by
the Communist Party of the Philippines and its military arm, the New People 's
Army ( NPA), as well as the <indig> Moro </indig> Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#4:1>
Ople said the Peru formula includes a vigorous program of social
justice, job generation and food security. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#5:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The <mention> 'bullet and bayonet' approach
</mention> alone will not extinguish the communist insurgency, &rdquo;
</quote> Ople stressed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#6:1>
He said the Peru formula was akin to the land reform strategy
employed by former President Ramon Magsaysay Sr. to lure <indig> Hukbalahap
</indig> guerrillas into surrendering and returning to the mainstream of
society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#7:1>
Ople noted that the Peru government successfully crushed the
<foreign> Luminoso Sendero </foreign> or &ldquo; Shining Path &rdquo; rebels
by addressing the root cause of the rebellion: poverty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#8:1>
Ople said the failure of the national and local governments in the
Philippines to provide basic services to the people has driven thousands to
the hills and led them to join the communist and Muslim secessionist
movements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#9:1>
Ople pointed out that the NPA, which started in the early ' 70s,
and the <foreign> Luminoso Sendero </foreign> rebellion were the
longest-running insurgencies in the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#10:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Peru has so far crippled the movement of the
Shining Path, but the Philippines has yet to crush the MILF and the NPA
movements, &rdquo; </quote> Ople said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#11:1>
He added that the NPA was able to retain most of its so-called
controlled territories over the past two years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#12:1>
Meanwhile, security officials said both the NPA and MILF have
been beefing up their forces even as they continue to dangle an olive branch
before the government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#13:1>
Brig. Gen. Jose Calimlim, head of the military 's intelligence
service, said the NPA has reestablished itself in areas where it has been
driven out, specifically in the provinces north and south of Metro Manila.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#14:1>
Calimlim issued the observation after emerging from the first
meeting of the National Security Council ( NSC) under the Estrada
administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#15:1>
Calimlim pointed out that NPA rebels were even spotted in areas
where they have not been active in the past. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#16:1>
He blamed the swelling of the NPA 's ranks to the reduction of
community-based militias and the absence of government agencies in remote
areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#17:1>
For his part, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said
the separatist MILF has also been strengthening its forces while pursuing
preliminary peace talks with the government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#18:1>
Despite the buildup, Aguirre said the MILF still wants the peace
process to go on. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#19:1>
The NSC agreed to pursue the peace process with both camps while
at the same time implementing a security and development strategy to address
the socio-economic and political concerns fueling the insurgency.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#20:1>
He did not elaborate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#21:1>
The communist rebels have been holding peace negotiations with
the government since 1992, but talks have been repeatedly delayed over
differences in the terms and conditions of the peace accord. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#22:1>
The military claims the NPA 's strength has dwindled from a peak
of 25,000 in the mid-1980s to only about 6,000 in 1997. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#23:1>
On the other hand, the MILF has an estimated armed force of about
11,900 fighters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#24:1>
The two rebel groups were left out of a peace agreement forged in
1996 between the government and the mainstream <indig> Moro </indig> National
Liberation Front ( MNLF). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#25:1>
In spite of the government 's peace initiatives in Mindanao,
sporadic fighting between soldiers and MILF rebels continues to ravage the
South. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#26:1>
<h> <bold> Clashes continue in Maguindanao </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#27:1>
Government troops and MILF fighters traded mortar and artillery
fire anew the other day in Maguindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#28:1>
The Army 's 6th Infantry Division said some 100 MILF guerrillas
pounded a camp of the 39th Infantry Division in Buldon town with 81-mm.
mortars. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#29:1>
Col. Rafael Romero, civil-military operations chief of the Armed
Forces Southeastern Command ( Southcom), said the troops responded with heavy
mortar firing in various MILF positions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#30:1>
Romero said the bombardment continued into the night as the
rebels amassed at their so-called <mention> &ldquo; defensive perimeters
&rdquo; </mention> in Buldon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#31:1>
The sporadic fighting between the two camps broke out last
Saturday, but no reports of casualties on either side were made. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#32:1>
Southcom reported that hundreds of villagers fled their homes in
Talayan town where a major MILF lair, Camp Omar, is located. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#33:1>
The military has deployed over 2,000 soldiers in Maguindanao.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#34:1>
Meanwhile, MILF vice chairman for military affairs Al Haj Murad
urged Armed Forces chief Gen. Joselin Nazareno to conduct a thorough probe of
the ongoing fighting in Central Mindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#35:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I believe Gen. Nazareno is not fully aware of
what is happening here, &rdquo; </quote> Murad said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#36:1>
He accused Southcom Chief Lt. Gen. Angelo Reyes and 6th ID
commander Maj. Gen. Rolando Bautista of triggering the latest attacks on MILF
headquarters in <foreign> Datu </foreign> Piang town, Maguindanao. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#37:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We do not understand it anymore.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#38:1>
The military has been launching these attacks on our posts even if
the ceasefire agreement is ( still) in effect, &rdquo; </quote> Murad said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#39:1>
He also charged that the military hierarchy has been <quote>
&ldquo; grossly politicized," </quote> with some commanders creating crisis
scenarios and issuing contradicting statements about the peace and order
situation in the South. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#40:1>
Murad claimed MILF guerrillas were directed to maintain a
defensive stance, but fight back <quote> &ldquo; when pushed against the
wall. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#41:1>
In another development, residents of Butuan City expressed alarm
over the reports that the MILF and the MNLF have set up training camps in a
remote <indig> barangay </indig> of the city and some parts of the Caraga
region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#42:1>
Earlier, military intelligence reports indicated that the MNLF
has also established a recruitment and training center in San Miguel town,
Surigao del Sur. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#43:1>
Col. Roland Amarille, commander of the Army 's 67th Infantry
Battalion based in San Miguel, warned local residents against the MNLF 's
recruitment activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#44:1>
Last October, some MNLF fighters led by a certain Abdul Hadji
Nikabulin reportedly visited San Miguel and Butuan Cuty aboard a convoy of
trucks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#45:1>
Amarille challenged the visitors, who introduced themselves as
emissaries of MNLF chieftain and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Gov.
Nur Misuari, to present their credentials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#46:1>
MNLF Maj. Pedro Lora, a devout Catholic and an active member of
the Knights of Columbus, confirmed to <mention> <bold> The STAR </bold>
</mention> that they were recruiting jobless people, including Christians.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#47:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We don't want to put our peaceful city and region
into jeopardy.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#48:1>
Our brother Muslims only want to establish brotherhood here, &rdquo;
</quote> Lora said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#49:1>
Calling themselves the <mention> &ldquo; Mindanao Composite Task
Force Command - <indig> Bangsa Moro </indig> Armed Forces, &rdquo; </mention>
MNLF Maj. Frank Delima added their group exists only for brotherhood and
livelihood cooperativism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#50:1>
Amarille insisted, however, that the group might have a sinister
motive, adding that he has initiated an investigation into the possibility
that the group could consist of MILF guerrillas posing as MNLF members. </p>

<h> <bold> Where is Ninoy 's passport? </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#52:2>
<bold> Perseus Echeminada </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#53:2>
Former First Lady Imelda Marcos dared yesterday former President
Corazon Aquino and former Vice President Salvador Laurel as well as close
friends of the late Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. to reveal how deeply involved the
US government was in the planning and the execution of the senator 's return
to Manila in 1983. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#54:2>
<quote> &ldquo; The late businessman Vicente 'Teng' Puyat told me
and many others that when he was with a select group in the US planning the
circuitous itinerary of Aquino to Manila, there were at least two Americans
who represented the US government in that meeting, &rdquo; </quote> Mrs.
Marcos said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#55:2>
Imelda 's claim is bolstered by the testimonies of <mention> <it>
Time </it> </mention> magazine Asia bureau chief Sandra Burton, who told the
Agrava Commission and the two subsequent <indig> Sandiganbayan </indig>
investigations that Aquino carried a US passport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#56:2>
Burton said the opposition leader showed his passport to a dozen
American journalists inside a hotel room in Taipei on Aug. 20, 1983, or a day
before he was shot dead at the then Manila International Airport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#57:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Where is that passport now? &rdquo; </quote> the
Marcos widow asked.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#58:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Why did the Agrava Commission and the subsequent
probes not seek to locate and recover it? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#59:2>
She continued: <quote> &ldquo; Who gave such a passport to Ninoy,
and why are his family and friends quiet about it? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#60:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Apparently, there are many questions that were
never asked and which are now begging for answers, &rdquo; </quote> she said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#61:2>
<quote> &ldquo; We beg the people who know anything about this to
please come forward in order for the country to be rid of this ghost once and
for all, &rdquo; </quote> Mrs. Marcos added.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#62:2>
<quote> &ldquo; They should tell the truth. ...no matter who gets
hurt. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#63:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I am sure the Aquino family, deep in their
hearts, want the truth to come out as much as the Marcoses do, too, &rdquo;
</quote> she said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#64:2>
Earlier, the Marcos widow dragged the US in Aquino 's slay,
saying its government misled and misinformed the Marcoses about his
whereabouts even on the day of the murder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#65:2>
The Marcos widow stressed that even while the China Airlines
plane carrying Aquino and several journalists were about to land at the then
Manila International Airport on Aug. 21, <quote> &ldquo; the highest official
at the US Embassy at that time was still assuring me on the telephone that
their intelligence reports indicate that the former senator was still in the
US. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#66:2>
Imelda was referring to a certain Minister Rich, who answered
Mrs. Marcos ' queries when then US Ambassador Michael Armacost was reportedly
out of his office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#67:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I find it hard to believe that the US Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the US Central Intelligence Agency were unaware
of Ninoy 's whereabouts, while all American news agencies knew exactly where
Ninoy was at that time, &rdquo; </quote> Mrs. Marcos said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#68:2>
In another development yesterday, a Marcos lawyer said Sen. Juan
Ponce Enrile would be the lead counsel in Mrs. Marcos ' fight for the
&peso;500-billion asset. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#69:2>
Lawyer Antonio Tupaz said he and other lawyers are now
consolidating pieces of evidence that would prove the Marcos family 's
ownership of several companies through the cronies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#70:2>
Tupaz 's statement contradicted earlier claims of Enrile that he
is on leave as a lawyer at the law firm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#71:2>
Enrile told reporters earlier that he would only provide legal
advice to the Marcoses. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#74:3>
<bold> On the eve of the country 's first judicial execution in
23 years, President Estrada cut his telephone hotline to the lethal injection
chamber in Muntinlupa, denying condemned Leo Echegaray any chance of a
last-minute reprieve. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#75:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I had it cut, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Estrada told
reporters yesterday.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#76:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I had talked to Bureau of Prisons Director Pedro
Sistoza and I told him not to expect phone calls from me.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#77:3>
They don't have to wait for any call. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#78:3>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said precautionary measures
have also been put in place in case pranksters mimic the voice of the
President and order a stay in the execution.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#79:3>
One such measure is for Sistoza to verify any call from
Malaca&ntilde;ang. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#80:3>
President Estrada said that he would just pray <quote> &ldquo;
three Our Fathers, three Hail Marys, and three Glory Bes &rdquo; </quote> for
Echegaray 's soul. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#81:3>
Echegaray, a 38-year-old former house painter and father of
three, is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 3 p.m. today
for repeatedly raping his stepdaughter when she was 10 years old in 1994.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#82:3>
He maintains that the rape charges stemmed from a property
dispute with the mother of his former live-in partner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#83:3>
Mr. Estrada, who has rejected appeals from the Vatican, the
European community, Canada and the London-based human rights group Amnesty
International, said he will <quote> &ldquo; feel good" </quote> after the
execution <quote> &ldquo; because it will be protecting several innocent
people. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#84:3>
<quote> &ldquo; As President, I have to follow the rule of law,
to implement the law, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#85:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I 've got to be firm to send a message to future
rapists that we mean business.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#86:3>
No one will change my mind, &rdquo; </quote> the President added.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#87:3>
Prison officials said everything is ready for Echegaray 's
execution.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#88:3>
There will be three injections administered one after the other.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#89:3>
The first induces sleep, the second relaxes the muscles and the third
stops the heartbeat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#90:3>
Prisons spokesman Superintendent Rosendo Tesoro said Echegaray
ended his one-week fast following an appeal from the prisons chaplain for the
condemned man to eat because an empty stomach might extend the time for the
drugs to take effect and make it more painful for Echegaray to die. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#91:3>
Echegaray only took vitamins, water and soda crackers last week
in a protest to profess his innocence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#92:3>
Prisons chaplain Fr. Roberto Olaguer told the condemned man that
a full stomach would make it easier for his body to absorb the first dose of
the lethal injection.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#93:3>
If Echegaray 's body rejects the first shot, <quote> &ldquo; he would
feel pain, &rdquo; </quote> the priest said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#94:3>
After the execution, the child rapist 's remains would be brought
to a funeral parlor in Valenzuela City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#95:3>
An official there said they expect thousands of people to view
Echegaray 's remains, posing a problem to the rapist 's family as well as to
the police.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#96:3>
The official said they might have to screen those who wish to see the
remains of the 38-year-old child rapist. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#97:3>
As prisons officials prepare the death chamber, Echegaray packed
his personal belongings, which consist of several pairs of pants, shirts, a
rosary, a bible, a stuffed toy, several towels and seven pairs of panties.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#98:3>
Zenaida Javier, who married Echegaray last December, said his
husband <quote> &ldquo; still cannot accept death. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#99:3>
<quote> &ldquo; He will not accept death because he is innocent,
&rdquo; </quote> she said. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#100:3>
She carried a pink rose and visited her husband for the last time
yesterday with officials prohibiting any more visits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#101:3>
Javier resisted being pulled out from Echegaray 's cell, until
she fainted and was rushed to the prison hospital. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#102:3>
When she regained her consciousness, Sistoza ordered Javier out
of the hospital, saying execution rules disallow relatives from visiting a
condemned man on the eve of the execution date. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#103:3>
A brownout happened inside the compound of the New <indig>
Bilibid </indig> Prisons ( NBP) yesterday afternoon but jail officials
immediately denied that it was intentionally done to disrupt the execution of
Echegaray. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#104:3>
The power failure started at around 2:30 p. m. to 4 p.m.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#105:3>
Officials said it was due to trouble in electrical lines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#106:3>
Also, at around 6 p.m., all cells of the prisoners were
padlocked to prevent them from causing troubles and protest actions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#107:3>
All cells will be opened only on Saturday morning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#108:3>
Many Filipinos back the death penalty because of exasperation
over widespread crime.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#109:3>
But others, led by the Catholic Church, say there is no proof that
capital punishment reduces crime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-004#110:3>
Justice Undersecretary Ramon Liwag suggested that the government
put up a panel that would study whether or not the death penalty is really a
deterrent to crime. </p>
