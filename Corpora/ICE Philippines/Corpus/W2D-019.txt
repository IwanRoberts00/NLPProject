<h> <bold> HOW TO </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#2:1>
<h> <bold> Start a candle business with &peso;500 </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#3:1>
<bold> By TINA ARCEO-DUMLAO </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#4:1>
GONE are the days when candles were used mainly for religious
celebrations and commemorating the dead.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#5:1>
With today 's generation rediscovering the relaxing and therapeutic
properties of candles, these most basic of light sources have become very
much a part of the 21st century lifestyle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#6:1>
Demand continues to grow as candles are now used for decorating
houses, as souvenirs and giveaways during special occasions and also for
adding to the ambiance in restaurants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#7:1>
This demand has made scented and decorative candle making a good
business opportunity for those who have the creativity to further stretch the
uses and designs of candles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#8:1>
Scented and decorative candles are not only easy to make but the
initial capital is not big and can generate a handsome profit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#9:1>
To start the business, the budding <foreign> entrepreneur
</foreign> would need wax, dye, scented oil, nylon candle wick and a wick
sustainer.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#10:1>
Based on the candle-making course of the <indig> Negoskwela </indig>
Livelihood and Technology Training Center, the tools and equipment include a
stove, wax container, storage racks, cutter, thermometer, stirrer ( wood,
bamboo, <foreign> etc. </foreign> ) and a weighing scale. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#11:1>
There are different kinds of wax but the most commonly used wax
is paraffin, which is a soft wax.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#12:1>
It is usually combined with microcrystallin - - a hard wax that makes
candles shiny and stearic or crystal polyethylene, which is also a hard wax,
so that the candles would not burn so fast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#13:1>
Paraffin usually makes up 90 percent of the wax ingredients when
making candles while microcrystallin and polyethylene contribute 5 percent
each.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#14:1>
So for one kilo of wax, 900 grams of paraffin is required and 50
grams each of polyethylene and microcrystallin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#15:1>
More hard wax can be used if you want the candles to bum slowly.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#16:1>
For the dye, candle makers have a choice between the ordinary or
technical dyes or the luminous/neon dyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#17:1>
Ordinary dyes can be added to the wax mixture even if it is still hot
while the luminous dyes have to be added only after the wax has slightly
cooled or if the mixture turns cloudy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#18:1>
Scented oil or fragrance, on the other hand, is classified into
organic/essential oil or synthetic oils.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#19:1>
Organic oil is recommended as only a small amount - - even a drop - -
is enough to add fragrance to the candles while it would take at least twice
as much volume of synthetic oil to produce the same effect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#20:1>
<indig> Negoskwela </indig> recommends the budding <foreign>
entrepreneurs </foreign> to prepare the wax in a well-ventilated workshop,
preferably outdoors, as wax is flammable. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#21:1>
<h> <bold> Methods of forming candles </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#22:1>
<h> <bold> Dipping. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#23:1>
It involves immersing the candle wick in melted wax then withdrawing
it, picking up wax as it emerges and then dipping it into water to harden the
wax.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#24:1>
The process is repeated until the desired thickness is obtained. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#25:1>
<h> Procedure: </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#26:1>
1. Put a candle wick in a hanger type or carousel type to allow
several candles to be made at one time.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#27:1>
2. Weigh nine parts of paraffin and one part of
polyethylene/microcrystallin and place in a vat.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#28:1>
Melt wax over direct heat.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#29:1>
3. Allow the mixture to cool to about 49 degrees Celsius before
dipping the candle wick.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#30:1>
4. Dip the candle wick in the melted wax and withdraw as smoothly as
possible to prevent imperfections.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#31:1>
5. When the desired candle size is attained, remove the lower portion
to obtain candles with uniform diameter.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#32:1>
6. Hang candles to dry.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#33:1>
A kilo of the combined paraffin/polyethylene mixture costs
&peso;45 and &peso;80, respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#34:1>
This can produce over 100 candles using the dipping method.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#35:1>
The candles can be sold for &peso;3 to &peso;5 each depending on the
size.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#36:1>
This means a profit of over &peso;400 from an investment of about
&peso;60. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#37:1>
<h> <bold> Pouring. </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#38:1>
Or putting candle mixtures into containers such as glass, ceramics
and metal. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#39:1>
<h> Procedure: </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#40:1>
1. Put paraffin wax and polyethylene wax in a pot or kettle for easy
pouring and melt over high heat.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#41:1>
2. When the wax is half-melted ( mixture is cloudy), bring down the
heat to medium.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#42:1>
( You can use more than 10 percent of the polyethylene wax if you
want your candle harder and you want it to burn longer.)

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#43:1>
3. When the wax has melted completely, dip wick in the mixture and
set aside to let the wax harden.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#44:1>
4. Add as much of the dye to the wax as you wish to achieve the color
you desire.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#45:1>
Stir with a wooden spoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#46:1>
5. Add the scented oil.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#47:1>
You can use more than 5 ml if you want a stronger-smelling candle.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#48:1>
6. Remove wax from heat, pour into container of your choice with the
wick placed in the middle.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#49:1>
The candle mixture should be allowed to cool to about 90 degrees
before it can be poured into the metal or glass container and even lower to
70 degrees if placed in a ceramic container. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#50:1>
Aside from simple containers, candle can also be poured into
plaster of paris or silicon rubber molds to produce more intricate designs
such as angels, stars or fruits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#51:1>
The initial investment for a basic mixture is about &peso;357.50.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#52:1>
This consists of five kilos of wax, some dye colorants, nylon wick,
wick sustainer to keep the wick upright, and gas used in the stove.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#53:1>
This mixture can already produce hundreds of simple candles and
decorative candles depending on the size of the container and the molds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#54:1>
Prices of scented and decorative candles are based on weight
since scented and decorative candles can take on different sizes and shapes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#55:1>
For ordinary or plain candles, the price is computed based on the
weight of the candles.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#56:1>
The price goes up depending on the color and scent added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#57:1>
For decorative candles, the factor is between 0.20 and 0.24
depending on the scent used. </p>

<h> <bold> Creating music costs money too </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#60:2>
<bold> By ANTHONY O. ALCANTARA </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#61:2>
<bold> THE BULK </bold> of the work in producing a song or a
piece of music is done in a recording studio - - for a price, of course. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#62:2>
Show business would not be much of a show without music.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#63:2>
This means recording studios are indispensable in the entertainment
world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#64:2>
Very few wonder at the nitty-gritty that goes into creating
music.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#65:2>
We take a look at the behind-the-scenes activities that go into
producing a song before you hear it on your favorite radio station. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#66:2>
Jay Manalo, manager of Greenhills Sound Productions, however,
says recording studios are expensive.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#67:2>
They 're definitely not for small-time undertakings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#68:2>
<quote> &ldquo; A studio costs about &peso; 3-&peso; 4 million,
considering that a 24-track recorder and a mixer each costs about a million
pesos already, &rdquo; </quote> says Manalo.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#69:2>
<quote> &ldquo; This is an estimate based on the five studios of
Greenhills Sound. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#70:2>
Because of the comparative decrease of prices of recording
equipment in the 1990s, according to Agnes Manalo, owner of AJI productions,
a rudimentary studio can now cost only &peso; 1 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#71:2>
This includes shipping of the imported equipment from the United
States. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#72:2>
<h> <bold> Sophisticated equipment </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#73:2>
The high technology used in making recording equipment makes it
expensive.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#74:2>
Recording studios nowadays are multi-tracked, meaning you can record
different instruments on each track and thereby enhance the sound produced by
each instrument separately for the desired effect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#75:2>
This process is called <mention> mixing </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#76:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Four of our studios here at Greenhills has 24
tracks each.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#77:2>
Only one has eight tracks.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#78:2>
With a 24-track studio, you can accommodate a whole orchestra--one
track for each instrument, &rdquo; </quote> says Ocampo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#79:2>
Mixers allow recording engineers to amplify the sounds to produce
the desired effect of the clients or producers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#80:2>
Greenhills Sound has not gone into digital recording yet, but it
plans to graduate from analog technology by early next year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#81:2>
Manalo, who uses digital recording technology in her studio at
her home, says the kind of equipment that one ought to buy depends on how one
plans to use it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#82:2>
Having the most advanced technology in your recording studio does
not necessarily equate with good music production. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#83:2>
<quote> &ldquo; In the end, it all depends on how one uses the
equipment, &rdquo; </quote> says Manalo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#84:2>
Ocampo has the same view.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#85:2>
He says: <quote> &ldquo; You may have the equipment, all right, but
if you don't know how to use it, <indig> <it> wala rin </it> </indig> .
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#86:2>
<h> <bold> Recording engineers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#87:2>
For Ocampo, recording engineers make and break recording studios.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#88:2>
<quote> &ldquo; They are the life of the studio.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#89:2>
Sometimes, clients come back only because of the engineer, &rdquo;
</quote> he says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#90:2>
At Greenhills Sound, they require people to have experience
before hiring them as record-engineers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#91:2>
A background in electronics is necessary since the engineers
themselves should be able to do the troubleshooting if there are minor
glitches.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#92:2>
There is, however, a maintenance engineer who does the major repairs.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#93:2>
As for Manalo, hers is a sole proprietorship.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#94:2>
She 's the manager and engineer rolled into one. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#95:2>
Actually, she graduated from the college of music of the
University of the Philippines with a degree in piano.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#96:2>
She found her calling in music production and engineering when she
was in New York. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#97:2>
She was then taking private lessons from Rebecca Kane, who
recommended the famous Berklee College of Music in Boston where she is an
alumna. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#98:2>
She has always been interested in how music is produced or
engineered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#99:2>
<quote> &ldquo; I really like listening to the radio, and I
wondered how beautiful music is produced.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#100:2>
I 've heard many bands rehearse their music and it isn't really that
good.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#101:2>
But during performance, their music was transformed, &rdquo;
</quote> Manalo says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#102:2>
This was, of course, due to the equipment used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#103:2>
But sophisticated equipment requires not only the technical
knowledge, but also the aesthetic sensibilities of the engineer necessary for
exemplary music, according to Manalo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#104:2>
Other friends also recommended Berklee to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#105:2>
She also learned that Louie Ocampo, Tony Tolentino and Robin Rivera,
the producer of <mention> Eraserheads </mention> , were alumni of this
prestigious school. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#106:2>
<quote> &ldquo; When I went to Boston to visit Berklee, I knew
it was the school for me.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#107:2>
So I went on to spend four of the best years of my life there,
&rdquo; </quote> says Manalo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#111:2>
For Manalo, she has worked with Joy Marfil, composer and
arranger of the music for the movie <mention> &ldquo; Mulanay, &rdquo;
</mention> an award-winning film where Jaclyn Jose starred.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#112:2>
She has also done the sequencing and the effects for the <mention>
Side A Live </mention> album, among others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#113:2>
<quote> &ldquo; In the <mention> Side A Live </mention> album,
the arrangement of the songs was not the actual arrangement in the concert.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#114:2>
The songs were rearranged and made to appear to be the actual
sequence.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#115:2>
Of course you have to make the clapping and cheering between songs
spontaneous and continuous, &rdquo; </quote> Manalo says. </p>

<h> <bold> Profitability </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#117:2>
Half of the profits of Greenhills Sound Productions come from
Ivory Records ' own productions.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#118:2>
Vicor Records, a sister company of <mention> Ivory </mention> , also
does its recordings at Greenhills Sound. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#119:2>
<quote> &ldquo; But we also have many clients not from Ivory or
Vicor who do their recordings here.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#120:2>
Some record the minus one or background music for their company
gatherings.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#121:2>
Others who have their own bands record their own songs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#122:2>
And especially now, those interested in joining Metropop go here to
record their demos, &rdquo; </quote> Ocampo says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#123:2>
These other clients, according to him, usually use up one to two
hours of recording time.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#124:2>
Hourly rates vary from &peso;500 to &peso;1,000, depending on the
place, the number of tracks to be used and whether the studio uses analog or
digital equipment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#125:2>
Asked if Manalo also makes profits from her small studio, she
has an emphatic <mention> &ldquo; No &rdquo; </mention> for an answer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#126:2>
She says her studio is not actually a recording studio.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#127:2>
A more accurate term for it, according to her, is project studio.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#128:2>
<quote> &ldquo; My studio is not actually for purely commercial
purposes like Greenhills Sound.

A project studio is actually run by the owner where he or she
creates her own projects, &rdquo; </quote> Manalo says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#130:2>
Advertising is really where the money is, according to her.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-019#131:2>
But she doesn't want the money as much as bringing out a good
product. </p>
