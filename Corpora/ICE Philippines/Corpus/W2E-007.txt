<h> <bold> Ford returns </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#2:1>
THE giant American car manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, has
announced it will return to the Philippine market after a 15-year absence.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#3:1>
The manner of its reentry into the local market has spawned a
controversy in the automotive industry.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#4:1>
Nevertheless the company 's announcement of plans to set up a
&peso;4.18-billion car assembly and parts manufacturing plant in Laguna is a
timely endorsement of the country 's efforts to become a major destination of
direct foreign investments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#5:1>
Two years ago, the Philippines lost out when another American car
maker, General Motors Corp., chose Thailand as the site of its
&dollar;750-million manufacturing plant.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#6:1>
GMC 's decision was a big blow on our morale and many people then
believed it also damaged our capability to attract investors from abroad.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#7:1>
But as the currency crisis in Asia begins to unravel, the
Philippines has come out stronger than expected.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#8:1>
While our neighbors are bogged down by the complexities of the fallout
from severe currency depreciation, the Philippines has showed remarkable
resiliency and its attractiveness as an investment haven has been enhanced.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#9:1>
Ford 's return to the Philippines engenders the hope that other
big foreign investors would follow.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#10:1>
Trade Secretary Cesar Bautista said two other car makers have
expressed interest to set up manufacturing plants in the country under the
same incentives given to the US car maker. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#11:1>
The Philippine Economic Zone Authority said Ford has been given
three incentives: 5 percent gross annual income tax rate compared to the
usual 35 percent; exemption from taxes on imported machinery and equipment;
and deduction in tax payments for half of the company 's personnel training.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#12:1>
PEZA oversees the special investment area where the plant will be
operating. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#13:1>
Officials said the company 's operations are expected to begin in
September next year.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#14:1>
It will offer in the market the Ford Laser, Ranger Double Cab and
Econovan Bus.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#15:1>
The company 's output will be <quote> &ldquo; totally domestic
market-oriented &rdquo; </quote> during the initial years of operation but it
is looking forward to exports in the near future, officials said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#16:1>
Local car assemblers have objected to the incentives offered by
the government to Ford because it would <quote> &ldquo; slant the playing
field clearly in favor of one participant ( of the government automotive
program. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#17:1>
) The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines, in a
letter to Bautista, said: <quote> &ldquo; We see no compelling reasons... [
for] granting special incentives to Ford for assembly operations when
apparently their only major added commitment is a large export projection
that is obviously subject to market conditions which may or may not happen.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#18:1>
But Bautista said the country needs an integrated automotive
manufacturing venture to enhance the competitiveness of the local industry,
especially its export-oriented parts-making facilities.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#19:1>
The Board of Investments also said it is drafting changes to the
country 's Motor Vehicle Development Program, which was last revised two
years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#20:1>
The changes include waiving the local content requirement on locally
assembled cars for assemblers earning at least &dollar;200 million from
exports, and an easing down of the &dollar;10-million minimum investment
requirements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#21:1>
The changes would hopefully improve our competitiveness in the
global village.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#22:1>
According to a study made by the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development and the International Chamber of Commerce ( ICC), the
confidence of the multinational companies in Asia has remained unshaken
despite the currency turmoil.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#23:1>
The study, which included a poll among 500 companies in the region,
showed that investments will remain and perceptions of prospects are
unchanged. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#24:1>
The study could be seen as an open invitation to investors to
come to the Philippines. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#X25:1>
<quote> &ldquo; This is a resounding vote of confidence on the
economic fundamentals of East and Southeast Asia and the region 's long-term
prospects. </X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#26:1>
Businesses still see enormous investment opportunities to be derived
from the projected growth of Asian markets, &rdquo; </quote> said ICC
Secretary General Maria Livanos Cattaui. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#27:1>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which the
Philippines is a member, said in a recent announcement it was ready to grant
&ldquo; pre-approvals &rdquo; to companies that are not yet operating in the
region under its ASEAN Industrial Cooperation ( AICO) program.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#28:1>
Under the program, participating firms can avail of such incentives
as preferential tariff of zero to 5 percent for their raw and intermediate
material requirements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#29:1>
Curt Magleby, Ford 's director for ASEAN affairs, has said the
company plans to expand its research in the region by riding on the AICO
bandwagon.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; By using AICO and the ASEAN Free Trade Area in our
planning base, we can develop more efficient operations in ASEAN to meet the
long-term challenges of competition and trade liberalization, &rdquo;
</quote> he said. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Mudslinging and threats </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#32:2>
WITH the unusually large number of presidential candidates in the
coming elections, 11 in all but seemingly narrowing down to Vice President
Joseph &ldquo; Erap &rdquo; Estrada and Speaker Jose de Venecia, one would
think the virulence of the muckraking now in progress would also be
subsiding. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#33:2>
But the contrary appears to be happening.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#34:2>
In fact, the mudslinging has become so venomous that the charges and
countercharges are losing much of the credibility that they had at the start.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#35:2>
Which should be good except that the people are getting more
confused. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#36:2>
To be sure, smear campaigns have always been part of Philippine
elections.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#37:2>
In the past, however, these were tolerable.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#38:2>
But today they seem to be getting out of control, unbearable, even
truly dangerous.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#39:2>
And the saddest part of all is that the people do not seem to be
aware of the dangers that the practice poses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#40:2>
Visions of the future, programs to achieve them and issues
confronting the nation used to be the bases for the people 's choice of
representatives in government, from president down to the lowly municipal
councilor.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#41:2>
Now, character assassination, defamation and outright criminal
charges against the opponent have taken over this function. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#42:2>
From Day One of the election contest, meaning when both Estrada
and De Venecia were perceived as serious presidential candidates, the battle
of verbal barbs started, initially almost in friendly fashion, then slowly
turned bitter and disquieting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#43:2>
The supporters of the Speaker intensified their attacks on Erap 's
unintentional murder of the English language and alleged ignorance in many
important matters, including economics, and the Veep 's drumbeats started
exhuming old charges against the Speaker.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#44:2>
It was not, however, until President Ramos endorsed the Speaker 's
candidacy and Erap won the presidential nomination of an alliance of two
opposition parties that the two camps went at each other 's jugular. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#45:2>
The most serious blow was delivered against the Vice President by
the Speaker 's camp, now headed by the President himself.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#46:2>
A former drinking buddy and trusted deputy of Erap when he was
chairman of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission came out with the charge
that the Vice President had plotted to assassinate President Ramos after
their election in 1992. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#47:2>
The &ldquo; bomb, &rdquo; although tainted by vengeance because
Erap 's accuser, police Senior Superintendent Reynaldo Berroya, was sent to
jail for more than four years at the PACC chairman 's initiative, was not
entirely incredible.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#48:2>
Berroya claimed he was asked three times by Erap to liquidate Ramos;
later a member of the Presidential Security Group announced he was willing to
corroborate the supposed existence of plot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#49:2>
In retaliation, a three-part excerpt of a book written by two
reporters of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism on the
supposed anomalous contract between the Public Estates Authority and the
Amari Coastal Bay Resources Corporation, which implicated top government
officials, including the President and the Speaker, appeared simultaneously
in most of Manila 's daily newspapers, presumably at the instigation of the
Vice President 's camp. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#50:2>
The supposed multibillion-peso Amari scandal was formally
investigated for several months by the Senate, the House of Representatives
and Malaca&ntilde;ang but nothing came out of these probes.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#51:2>
However, the charges and countercharges pertaining to the Berroya and
Amari cases continue unabated, except that in the latter the brunt of the
accusations have been shifted to Mr. Ramos and away from Speaker de Venecia.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#52:2>
In the same manner, the charges of alleged efforts of the
administration to frustrate the coming elections so Mr. Ramos can remain in
office indefinitely continues to be peddled by the opposition to the
unsuspecting public.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#53:2>
The latest to make the charge was reelectionist Senator Freddie Webb,
who claimed Malaca&ntilde;ang was planning to use a resurgence of the
communist and Muslim insurrections to justify a failure of elections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#54:2>
Other oppositionists who had earlier warned of No-El or no
elections included former Senate President Ernesto Maceda, who is running for
mayor of Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#55:2>
Among other things, according to Maceda, the administration was
allegedly using the Commission on Elections to thwart the holding of the
polls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#56:2>
He cited the bungling of the COMELEC, including the allegedly
irregular printing of election returns forms by a private firm that could at
the least postpone the elections if the forms are not ready by election day,
the &ldquo; botched &rdquo; computerization plan, and the attempt to oust the
Catholic clergy from participating in the election &ldquo; quick count
&rdquo; of the National Movement for Free Elections as proof that
Malaca&ntilde;ang was out to sabotage the elections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#57:2>
All these warnings of a failure of elections, to our thinking,
are designed merely to gain publicity mileage by those who tout them.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#58:2>
They must be their answer to the ban on political advertising in
print and electronic media. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#59:2>
These should be harmless exercises, except that they exacerbate
the problem of the electorate being horribly uninformed or misinformed when
they choose their officials.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#60:2>
It is not politically healthy when people have nothing to consider
but defamation, vilification and slander when they cast their ballots. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#61:2>
It is time our political leaders go back to their vision for the
nation, their programs of government, and the issues confronting the nation
as the bases for the people to select their representatives to government.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#62:2>
If they continue with their muckraking and warnings of possible
bloodshed from a failure of elections, our leaders can only succeed in the
election of personalities unprepared to run the government, in short a
mediocre administration. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Sounds familiar </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#64:3>
OVERSHADOWED by the more visceral issues in the run up to the May
11 national elections is the exit of the Philippines from 35 years of
International Monetary Fund ( IMF) tutelage and control.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#65:3>
Many people are seemingly unaware of the significance of our country
becoming free from IMF supervision because the nation 's attention is mainly
focused on the polls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#66:3>
House of Representatives Speaker Jose de Venecia, who is the
Ramos administration candidate for president, has announced in Hong Kong that
the Philippines has exited from IMF control at the weekend and is now moving
toward full economic independence.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#67:3>
He told a gathering of fund managers coming from different parts of
the world that the Philippines would implement measures, including bringing
down interest rates at least one percent every week, to animate the business
climate in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#68:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We are graduating from being Asia 's basket case
as some of the most powerful economic tigers in the region have come under
stringent IMF controls, &rdquo; </quote> De Venecia told the Credit
Suisse-First Boston Asian Investment Conference. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#X69:3>
<quote> &ldquo; We are celebrating this year 100 years of political
independence.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#X70:3>
After 35 years under IMF control, the Philippines is now free
economically. &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#71:3>
Due to its ailing economy, the Philippines had been dependent on
IMF assistance to get through its financial troubles.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#72:3>
In exchange, it has had to comply with stringent requirements imposed
by the Fund. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#73:3>
Some of the IMF requirements had a major impact on such official
decisions as interest rates and procedures involved in business loans.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#74:3>
In many instances, the interest of the country became subordinate to
the interest of the Fund.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#75:3>
As a result, the IMF became a favorite &ldquo; whipping boy &rdquo;
of activists and anti-administration groups. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#76:3>
While De Venecia was addressing the fund managers in Hong Kong, a
rowdy group of protesters gathered outside the US Embassy in Manila
denouncing the United States and the IMF which, they claimed, were
responsible for the Asian financial crisis.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#77:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The US and its global financial and trade instruments
such as the IMF... are the real culprits behind the economic crises that hit
the country and the whole of East Asia, &rdquo; </quote> said a statement
handed out at the rally. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#78:3>
The demonstration followed reports that about 43,000 people could
lose their jobs in the first six months of 1998, as industries are forced to
slash jobs as a result of severe currency depreciation that hit the
Philippines and the other Asian countries in the past several months.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#79:3>
Companies blame the peso depreciation, high production costs, lack of
operating capital and shortage of raw materials as the cause of the job cuts.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#80:3>
The government has put up a &peso;200-million loan fund for the
displaced workers.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#81:3>
Employee Compensation Commission Executive Director Teofilo Hebron
said each laid-off worker will be given a maximum of &peso;12, 500 soft loan.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#82:3>
<quote> &ldquo; The loan shall be payable within two years in equal
monthly installments and which payment shall start after one year or 12
months moratorium following the date of the loan release, &rdquo; </quote>
Hebron said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#83:3>
Despite the unsettling reports, the Philippines looks forward to
better prospects in the year ahead.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#84:3>
Financial officials from 14 economies attending the Asia-Pacific
Bankers Congress in Manila said they believe the Philippines will emerge with
a stronger economy after the crisis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#85:3>
The officials, who are deputy finance ministers and deputy
central bank governors, called for the adoption of <quote> &ldquo; sound
economic and financial policies, coupled with appropriate structural reforms
&rdquo; </quote> in Asian nations plagued by sluggish growth.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#86:3>
<quote> &ldquo; Overall, deputies felt that substantial progress has
been made toward a resolution of the Asian financial crisis, although
important policy challenges remain, &rdquo; </quote> they said in a
statement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#87:3>
A footnote in the talks was the result of negotiations between
the IMF and the Philippines ' three Asian neighbors: South Korea, Thailand
and Indonesia.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#88:3>
As a result of the economic slump set off by a wave of rapid currency
devaluations, the three countries have been forced to accept bailouts
orchestrated by the IMF. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#89:3>
Press reports said the IMF has delayed payment of a
&dollar;3-billion installment of Indonesia 's &dollar;43-billion total aid
package until at least next month, pending the outcome of talks to revise the
terms of the bailout.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#90:3>
Doesn't it sound familiar?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-007#91:3>
The Philippines used to grapple with the problem only a few years
ago. </p> </I>
