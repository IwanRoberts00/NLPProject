 <$A> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#1:1:A>
Very pleasant afternoon to everyone ladies and gentlemen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#2:1:A>
Uh how are you today <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#3:1:A>
Fine okay I understand it 's a very exciting week <indig> 'no </indig> <.> culmina </.> culminating week of your Science Week
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#5:1:A>
Is that right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#6:1:A>
Yeah first of all can I ask uh are most of you in what what colleges do you come from
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#7:1:A>
Political Science come again Engineering Liberal Arts Computer uh-huh Commerce anyone from Commerce
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#14:1:A>
Right okay so this is actually a diverse group <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#15:1:A>
So at least I know who I am addressing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#16:1:A>
Anyway I 'd like to thank uh Bing for that very warm introduction and I 'd like to thank your placement office for accepting our uhm talk for this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#17:1:A>
So uh I 'm Ms Gail Martinez and uh I am from the Cora Doloroso Espa&ntilde;a branch
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#18:1:A>
Uh perhaps uh we were thinking of either passing around something but we felt that it 's not necessary like uh you know like a brochure
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#19:1:A>
But I 'm sure you 're quite uh knowledgeable about locations you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#20:1:A>
So our school is located along Espa&ntilde;a in front of U S T
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#21:1:A>
You heard of U S T
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#22:1:A>
So we are just right across the U S T campus on Espa&ntilde;a
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#23:1:A>
The reason uh we are here uh my companion is actually Mr Janus Ligpit he 's our staff and he 'll be assisting me later
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#25:1:A>
But uh the reason why we are here is uh for those of you who have not heard so much of our school is to be able to sort of orient you and enlighten you rather on how personality development can really be a very very basic ingredient in the success of one 's career as well as just day-to-day living <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#26:1:A>
Uhm I 'm sure you have a basic understanding of what is personality right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#28:1:A>
Can I just ask the lady in stripe red
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#29:1:A>
Can I ask just because there has to be some participation otherwise you 'd fall asleep
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#30:1:A>
So my talk will not just be a lecture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#31:1:A>
It will actually be a demonstration lecture and visual presentation so that you don't knock out on me <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#32:1:A>
So Ms Lady in red and white you are in college
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#33:1:A>
I 'm sure you have gone through how many sixteen years of your you know <O> chuckle </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#34:1:A>
Anyway can you possibly tell us uhm in your own words what is personality to you <&> inaudible response </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#35:1:A>
Quite right okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#36:1:A>
Uh gentleman in red
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#37:1:A>
<indig> Mahilig ako sa </indig> red <indig> ngayon </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#38:1:A>
I 'd like to just spot pick on people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#39:1:A>
What is personality to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#40:1:A>
To the lady it 's the totality of a person
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#41:1:A>
You <&> inaudible response </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#42:1:A>
Self-essence okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#43:1:A>
So the essence of all your qualities and that comes out in the way you do things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#44:1:A>
So let me just give you a brief summary to capture uh to capsulize the meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#45:1:A>
So personality may be defined as the sum total of the quality and characteristics of a person as shown in her manner of walking talking dressing attitude interests and ways of reacting to people and situations 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#46:1:A>
That shows your personality as a whole
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#47:1:A>
Personality is also not just that but uh it can be also the physical emotional intellectual and spiritual dimensions of a person right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#48:1:A>
So it also goes deeper than what people see
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#49:1:A>
All of you now are in college
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#50:1:A>
I would think most of you are eighteen nineteen twenty years old right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#51:1:A>
Did I miss any age did I overshoot underage or what
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#53:1:A>
But anyway at this point <indig> 'no </indig> you are going through a transition from being teenagers to coming into the real world of professionals right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#54:1:A>
You are in <.> prepar </.> preparing yourselves to become professionals in the world as what De La Salle the De La Salle mission states that you know to come up with whole persons right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#55:1:A>
And to be a whole person it 's not it 's not enough that you are knowledgeable here but your knowledge should also be more complete and whole in the development of your characteristics your personality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#56:1:A>
You may be very good in academics very good but if you 're very well uh weak let 's say so your strong points may be the academic but your weak points are in personal relations and dealings with people uh be they professors or boys and girls or whoever then I wouldn't think you 're successful
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#57:1:A>
You are not successful I 'm I have to say this straight to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#59:1:A>
A successful person according to research in Harvard is that eighty-five percent of their success is attributed to their attitude and personality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#60:1:A>
Fifteen percent is to their what they know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#61:1:A>
Because you may have a lot of things in your head but you don't know how to go about it in life and deal with people you cannot communicate your ideas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#62:1:A>
You just know it here and you just stick to yourself then you are not what you call <mention> a whole person </mention> and what De La Salle wants is a whole person
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#63:1:A>
So personality plays an important role
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#64:1:A>
I for one am a graduate of De La Salle in Mass Com and Psychology but I lived abroad for seven years I worked there and I learned so much about life and ups and downs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#66:1:A>
But because of that learning process I found out that it 's not how much you know but it 's more on your dealings with people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#67:1:A>
But don't take me wrong
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#68:1:A>
It 's good to be academically excellent no problem about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#70:1:A>
No doubt about that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#71:1:A>
But coupled with personality you will make it big out there okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#72:1:A>
And don't forget Him of course <indig> 'no </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#73:1:A>
So uh let us assess now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#74:1:A>
You are teenagers going into your twenties
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#75:1:A>
I was once yours at your stage and boy it was really adjustment <indig> 'no kasi </indig> like I was in a <.> wo </.> girls school all my life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#77:1:A>
Then when I got to La Salle we were only twenty-five percent female of the whole population
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#78:1:A>
<indig> Buti </indig> you you are now fifty percent of the population or more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#79:1:A>
More <indig> 'no </indig> okay so you 're very uh blessed with that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#81:1:A>
So I 'd like to demonstrate to you a few things
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#82:1:A>
How personality can really help you in your dealings day-to-day
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#83:1:A>
It will be a practical thing alright because when you start working ladies and gentlemen it 's good that the interviewer who interviews you on the job sees your academic potentials
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#85:1:A>
But when it comes to actual emanation of you know your personality he sees you lacking in some things then he would have to you know uh assess you more if he should choose another one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#86:1:A>
Because granted there was a secretary I knew she was good at typing steno computer but she was so quiet and so you know to herself that a new person came in the office who didn't type as fast who didn't steno as fast and who was poor in computer but because she was so lively and very good in communicating she got a job that was she was promoted faster than the secretary with skills
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#87:1:A>
That 's just a very solid example
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#88:1:A>
Alright one of the courses we teach in Cora Doloroso is <,> I 'll write on the board <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#89:1:A>
<mention> Savvy Skills </mention> is for women it can be for men
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#90:1:A>
We call it <mention> Personal Development </mention> for men but Savvy Skills deals with a total personality which deals with what poise etiquette
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#92:1:A>
What is etiquette
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#93:1:A>
Manners okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#94:1:A>
At least that much you can tell me uh personal relations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#95:1:A>
For the ladies make-up and skin care 'cause when you start working you are not to go to the office with a blank face
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#96:1:A>
You have to put on something color to look uh professionally groomed so to speak
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#98:1:A>
Grooming is a very important subject
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#99:1:A>
So I used to teach grooming last year to the ORIENT three <&> name of orientation course in La Salle </&> <indig> 'no </indig> okay ORIENT two three okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#101:1:A>
So grooming uhm entertaining is one of our subjects because you socialize and you have to learn the interactions okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#102:1:A>
Then personal relations even selection of wines is included so that you 're not gonna be caught oh oh I don't know how to select wines oh oh I 'll think I 'll order a Coke oh oh uh things like that <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#103:1:A>
So at least you are knowledgeable even if you don't drink you know what I mean
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#104:1:A>
You don't drink but you have to order something that sounds alcoholic so you don't look so <indig> neneng-neneng </indig> you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#105:1:A>
So for example uhm uh there 's a drink called <mention> rum cola </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#106:1:A>
You 've heard that <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#107:1:A>
Rum cola there 's rum and there 's cola
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#108:1:A>
Seventy-five percent of it is rum <indig> e </indig> Coke I 'm sorry one uh twenty-five percent is rum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#109:1:A>
So now you can tell the waiter I 'll order a rum cola but less on the rum or something like that okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#110:1:A>
So it 's like you 're ordering really an alcoholic drink but you 're removing the rum in turn you have Coke right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#111:1:A>
Okay so there 's just so much for you to learn in order to be socially adaptable to different people right okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#112:1:A>
So what else
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#113:1:A>
So wine selection
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#114:1:A>
Can I have a brochure please <indig> kasi </indig> uh when I face all of you you know I get wow
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#115:1:A>
Okay so next we have conversational abilities is one of them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#116:1:A>
<indig> Kasi </indig> it 's good that you can communicate to all levels of people be they managers you know be they drivers or servants or you know uh officemates you know things like that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#119:1:A>
And then culture updates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#120:1:A>
So culture update is more on appreciation of art and music now and the present
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#121:1:A>
So you 're not totally out of touch <indig> 'no </indig> with what 's going on okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#122:1:A>
Then uh <,> poise is one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#123:1:A>
So practically uh ten subject matters
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#124:1:A>
So now I am going to demonstrate a little bit <indig> naman 'no </indig> so a little showmanship of how to walk for the ladies <&> the speaker demonstrates and laughter from audience </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#125:1:A>
Okay I told you this is a variety show but the only thing I 'm not going to sing <indig> 'no </indig> that 's one thing I 'm still practicing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#128:1:A>
So for the ladies how will I do this you know where
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#129:1:A>
Uhm I would have to walk this way then I 'll just try walking this way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#130:1:A>
Uh I don't know how far you can see me
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#131:1:A>
The ladies on this side can you see me at this point
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#132:1:A>
And the men
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#133:1:A>
Later on I 'll go to that side as much as possible you could try to stretch your neck down
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#134:1:A>
So ladies <indig> 'no </indig> in general we are very normal amphibians amphibians <indig> ba tayo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#136:1:A>
Yeah so when we walk it 's just a normal pacing of walking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#137:1:A>
So I would assume a normal walk for us generally speaking will be like this <indig> 'no </indig> <O> demonstration </O> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#138:1:A>
You may not know it but these are the subtleties of personality development
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#139:1:A>
What would be the way how would be the way we teach it at Cora Doloroso
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#140:1:A>
You see this line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#141:1:A>
That line okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#142:1:A>
The line would indicate that you are to walk in a straight line with one foot in front of the other but don't make it in such a point that you 're like walking on a tight rope on a circus string <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#143:1:A>
No no no that doesn't mean that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#144:1:A>
It means you have an imaginary line wherein your feet are no longer parallel but your feet are going alignment in front of the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#145:1:A>
Now pretend you 're in a palace and you 're walking through the palace floor you know or in a <.> grace </.> or in a park
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#146:1:A>
So you would have to walk this way
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#147:1:A>
So right left right left and you make a turn
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#148:1:A>
Turn right left right left and then turn
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#149:1:A>
You do it in a way that is smooth <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#150:1:A>
<indig> Hindi 'yung </indig> <O> demonstration </O> C A T <indig> na 'yan 'no gano'n </indig> <O> audience laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#152:1:A>
What we mean is be very natural
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#153:1:A>
So when you start working even now when you 're walking through the campus and the guys are all watching everybody watching you so at least <indig> naman </indig> you have some kind of gait <indig> 'no </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#154:1:A>
Now this is preferable if you wear one inch heels <indig> kasi </indig> I notice we are now <.> wear </.> most girls are wearing <w> boys' </w> shoes and flat shoes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#155:1:A>
Well never the mind as you uh start progressing into the professional world you 'd have to practice wearing heels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#156:1:A>
And we teach you to wear heels in offices whatever offices you go into at least one and a half inches
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#157:1:A>
Don't wear flats
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#158:1:A>
You 'd look like an ordinary clerk
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#159:1:A>
You see that is part of personality
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#160:1:A>
You wear one and a half
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#161:1:A>
Okay that 's part of wardrobe okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#162:1:A>
For the men you don't walk in a straight line okay <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#163:1:A>
Men don't walk in a straight line thank goodness otherwise okay you just walk in the normal <indig> 'yon </indig> okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#165:1:A>
So boys have no problem
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#166:1:A>
So that 's savvy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#167:1:A>
Okay next I would like to demonstrate also uh <,> okay how to carry a shoulder bag
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#168:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#169:1:A>
Can I borrow a bag please does uh anyone okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#170:1:A>
You know this is a very practical very practical lecture
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#171:1:A>
I don't lecture to make you sleep because that 's not the point of it all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#172:1:A>
But I have to show you techniques to show how important these all are
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#173:1:A>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#174:1:A>
Let 's say you 're going shopping somewhere or going to a certain place where you know there are lots of uh <indig> mandurukot </indig> you know <indig> kasi </indig> we sometimes have to go to places like Recto or Tondo or Divisoria or whatever uh places that you know are where these people abound <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#176:1:A>
So what you do is you place uh well let 's first go to Makati
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#177:1:A>
Okay first I want to show the difference <O> laughter </O> or Galleria
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#178:1:A>
So for the men no problem because normally you don't carry much like a clutch bag or something is normal <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#180:1:A>
But for the ladies well as usual <indig> marami tayong bitbit 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#181:1:A>
Okay <,> okay so if possible we could carry a briefcase with all our stuff
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#182:1:A>
But for places that are safe no need to fear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#183:1:A>
Keep your bag at the side and you just walk <O> demonstration </O> in a swinging manner okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#184:1:A>
For places that are you know uhm full of uh <indig> mandurukots </indig> I believe you should place your three fingers okay three fingers at the handle this way and place it right in front of your okay okay lap here okay and then just walk okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-060#185:1:A>
Now it might make you feel well at least poised <indig> ka rin kahit natatakot kang madukutan 'no <indig> <O> laughter </O> 

 </I>
