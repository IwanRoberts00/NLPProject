<h> <bold> Keep Cambodia out of ASEAN </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#2:1>
THE ASSOCIATION of Southeast Asia ( ASEAN) foreign ministers did
the right thing in postponing indefinitely the entry of Cambodia into the
regional grouping. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#3:1>
Putting on hold Cambodia 's entry to the ASEAN should put
additional pressure on the Hun Sen government to respect the 1991 UN-brokered
peace accord that provided for a coalition government.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#4:1>
The recent Hun Sen-led <foreign> coup d'etat </foreign> that sent
First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh to exile in France is clearly a
case of a violent change in government that deserves condemnation by ASEAN.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#5:1>
<quote> &ldquo; For those of us who signed the accords in Paris,
we would not be very happy seeing the results of the ( 1993 UN sponsored)
elections set aside, especially by use of force, &rdquo; </quote> says
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, Jr. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#6:1>
That sentiment is apparently shared by the other ASEAN ministers,
even as Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi earlier remark that
ASEAN will adhere to the principle of non-interference in a neighbor 's
internal affairs had raised fears that Cambodia 's membership would push
through despite the violent take-over by Hun Sen forces. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#7:1>
That the ASEAN decision to deny Cambodia 's membership for the
time being is a correct step is validated by the position taken by the UN
special representative to Cambodia, Ambassador Thomas Hammerberg, who said in
statement that he <quote> &ldquo; strongly condemns the violent <foreign>
coup d'etat </foreign> which has displaced the lawfully elected government.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#8:1>
The violent <foreign> coup d'etat </foreign> that toppled
Ranariddh from power has been justified by Hun Sen as necessary in the light
of what he claims were attempts by his co-premier to align with the Khmer
Rouge.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#9:1>
Hun Sen himself, it may be recalled, was installed in power back in
1979 with no small help from the Vietnamese.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#10:1>
Expecting him to behave in democratic fashion by respecting peace
agreements and elections is therefore like asking a leopard to change its
spots. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#11:1>
Unless the Hun Sen regime can show adequate proof that it is
willing to adhere to democratic processes and is giving up its obsession to
keep political power through the barrel of a gun, the ASEAN should keep
Cambodia out.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#12:1>
Some lessons in democracy are perhaps best taught outside the
classroom.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#13:1>
In this particular case, Hun Sen will have to stay in the dunce 's
corner for the time being. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#15:2>
CONTROVERSY has dogged the Unification Church led by the Rev. Sun
Myung Moon ever since we can remember, because of their unconventional ways
of recruiting members, solemnizing marriage vows, and professing their faith.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#16:2>
In the Philippines, they are not only finding themselves under
the harsh glare of negative publicity, they are practically fighting for
their right to exist. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#17:2>
The local members of the sect have raised a number of issues that
should at the very least be looked into by the proper authorities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#18:2>
One, religious persecution.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#19:2>
The Church held a blessing ceremony at the PICC on January 23, 1996
at which some 983 Filipina church members were betrothed to foreigners.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#20:2>
They ask: by what right can government interfere with their personal
decision to marry in this way, if their form of worship calls for it?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#21:2>
What harm is done to others and to the country when they choose to
worship in this way? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#22:2>
Two, manufactured charges.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#23:2>
Government prosecutors have filed a number of charges against the
sect:

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#24:2>
*One charge of illegal recruitment under R.A. 8042 ( the Migrant
Workers ' Act) and two charges of violations of R.A. 6955 ( the Mail Order
Bride Law), all filed with the RTC in Quezon City;

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#25:2>
*One charge of violation of Art. 177 of the Revised Penal Code (
Usurpation of Public Functions) filed with the RTC in Pasay City. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#26:2>
The sect denies the illegal recruitment charge, saying the entire
case rests on the testimony of one former church member who joined the church
under false pretenses by declaring she was single and asking to be matched to
a foreigner, when in fact she was already married and had four children.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#27:2>
Based on her testimony, ten sect members face detention without bail.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#28:2>
The sect likewise denies any violation of the Mail Order Bride
Law, which specifies the collection of a fee as a basis for violation.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#29:2>
The NBI found that the Church received &peso;1,500 from some of the
brides, but the money, says the Church, was used to pay for passport and visa
fees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#30:2>
Three, human rights violations.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#31:2>
Unificationists claim that they have been harassed by a congressional
inquiry for over a year now.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#32:2>
Meanwhile, the Filipina brides have been denied immigration clearance
to travel wherever they please, and even face detention without bail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#33:2>
Four, harassment and lack of fair play.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#34:2>
The DOJ is said to have filed cases against the sect in different
courts.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#35:2>
This, in their view, is pure and simple harassment that is likely to
drive them to penury. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#36:2>
And five, they are crying extortion.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#37:2>
It seems that after the media and Rep. Ranjit Shahani were charging
that the Washington Times Foundation had tried to bribe Filipino legislators
last March, an emissary of the legislators was telling Church leaders in
Washington D.C. that for the sum of &peso;10 million, no charges would be
filed against the Church members.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#38:2>
Later, an emissary told the group that for the sum of
&dollar;500,000, the charges would not be filed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#39:2>
The Church turned down both requests. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#40:2>
The last charge is a serious one that we think deserves to be
looked into by the Department of Justice.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#41:2>
Is the Unification Church being harassed and persecuted in this
country because they turned down a plain and simple extortion demand?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#42:2>
The ball is in the hands of Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr.
who fought all kinds of persecution during the Marcos regime. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Unclean water </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#44:3>
IF WE 're to believe Sen. Orlando Mercado, we should now put the
Boracay brouhaha behind us, and begin to address the bigger disaster case:
the contamination of Metro Manila water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#45:3>
Metro Manila residents may have felt far removed from the
controversy when Boracay was declared by the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources a disaster area after finding high levels of coliform
contamination in its beaches.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#46:3>
But the plague of dirty water may have been with us even before the
Boracay case took place, Sen. Mercado now says, citing <quote> &ldquo;
independent and focused testing &rdquo; </quote> by the Senate committee on
environment which he heads showing a <quote> &ldquo; disturbing pattern that
waters both from underground aquifers and MWSS distribution pipes are heavily
laced with fecal coliform. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#47:3>
The Mercado revelation does not really surprise us.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#48:3>
We 've long suspected that Metro Manila has always been contaminated,
especially during the rainy season, with just the strong hint of chlorine in
our tap water to remind us that the MWSS is using generous amounts of
chemicals to keep our guts from turning upside down from coliform and
whatever else is found in our sewers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#49:3>
The senator himself recently went to two public markets and a
public school in Quezon City to conduct water potability tests.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#50:3>
His findings: water from deep wells, aboveground reservoirs and
distribution pipes linked to MWSS water mains having <quote> &ldquo; moderate
to heavy contamination of human waste. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#51:3>
These results, if taken in conjunction with earlier findings from
similar tests in the Tatalon area, reveal, according to Mercado, the need for
<quote> &ldquo; a much wider campaign in other densely populated areas,
public markets, schools and even government facilities frequented by our
people. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#52:3>
We concur with this recommendation.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#53:3>
The Department of Health should start a thorough and comprehensive
testing of the quality of drinking water before a major outbreak of
gastro-intestinal disease takes place in the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#54:3>
Especially now that the rainy season is here, untreated water could
mean a major epidemic just waiting to happen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#55:3>
If there is one lesson that the Boracay episode holds for us city
residents, it is this: we reap the whirlwind of our own folly.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#56:3>
We have contaminated our own water supply by throwing our waste
everywhere, and then we complain that government is lax in enforcing
environmental safeguards.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#57:3>
Perhaps the question should be posed: who will save us from
ourselves? </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Anti-drugs drive </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#59:4>
MANILA Mayor Alfredo Lim 's unorthodox campaign against drug
trafficking may have raised the hackles of human rights groups, but who 's to
say that it is all for naught? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#60:4>
Marking the homes of suspected drug dealers - - some 200 of them,
as of last count - - will definitely not stop the drug problem dead in its
tracks.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#61:4>
But we 're inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt given the
extent of the social menace. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#62:4>
And until such time that the proper court of law deems Mayor Lim 's
unconventional approach unconstitutional and a violation of law, we are
reserving further judgment on the issue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#63:4>
We share the apprehensions of those who feel that Mayor Lim 's
anti-drugs drive could be open to abuse, and could lead to mob rule.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#64:4>
Senior Superintendent Avelino Razon Jr., the lead implementor of
Mayor Lim 's strategy of humiliating the pushers in their own neighborhood,
has made it clear he won't tolerate such abuse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#65:4>
But there is merit too in the position taken by those who support
the mayor 's renewed campaign. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#66:4>
Among them is the Philippine Constitutional Association.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#67:4>
The group takes another tack, saying that <quote> &ldquo; the
constitutional mandate ( Article II-Section 15) requiring the State to
protect and promote the right of health of the people and instill health
consciousness among them, must include the duty to warn the people of
products, places and conditions that may be injurious to their health.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#68:4>
In defending Mayor Lim, Philconsa says the Constitution is a
<quote> &ldquo; dynamic organ formulated to protect the citizens from forces
that wage virtual war against the life, the health and safety of the people.
<X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#X69:4>
It cannot, and must not be used as a shield by elements engaged in
the destruction of society. &rdquo; </X> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#70:4>
Thus, <quote> &ldquo; the rights of the victims of drug addiction
deserve a higher priority than the rights of those who invoke the principle
of due process. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#71:4>
We take the view - - as do many others who feel that the drug
problem has clearly gone out of control - - that the State has the
prerogative to resort to extraordinary measures when clearly warranted by
public interest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#72:4>
But having said that, we also must urge authorities to exercise
extreme caution in enforcing the law.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#73:4>
The unfortunate incident that resulted in the killing of Polly
Lacson, an eight-year old girl killed by police manning a checkpoint near the
residence of a businessman suspected of involvement in illicit drugs,
demonstrates the extent to which the stepped-up anti-drugs campaign could go
- - completely awry - - if there are no adequate safeguards against abuses by
law enforcers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#74:4>
Given our experience with martial law, we don't feel comfortable
endorsing a strategy that would be open to police abuse.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#75:4>
But we believe in the analysis that the drug problem has become so
serious, it requires extraordinary solutions. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#76:4>
<h> <bold> 'Che' lives </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#77:4>
RELENTLESSLY pursued by the military regimes in Latin America as
a threat to their rule and detested even by hardcore Marxists-Leninists for
&ldquo; romanticizing &rdquo; revolution during his brief lifetime, Ernesto
&ldquo; Che &rdquo; Guevarra in death looms as a towering figure of the
rebellious decade of the Sixties, if not of the entire 20th century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#78:4>
The skeletal remains of the late guerrilla leader were recently
retrieved in Bolivia, where he died in 1967, and brought to Cuba.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#79:4>
There, Fidel Castro has given his remains the proper homage befitting
a national hero. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#80:4>
Guevarra was born on June 14, 1928 in Rosario, Argentina.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#81:4>
He was the eldest of five children in a middle-class family.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#82:4>
Though troubled by asthma, he excelled as an athlete and a scholar,
completing his medical studies in 1953.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#83:4>
Seeing the conditions of poverty of the people in Latin America
convinced him that violent revolution was the only path to their
emancipation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#84:4>
That conviction made him decide to join Fidel Castro in waging
the Cuban revolution to a successful conclusion in 1959 and helping out the
Marxist government.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#85:4>
In April 1965, he dropped out of public life to go Congo with other
Cuban guerrilla fighters to organize a guerrilla force there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#86:4>
In late 1966, Guevarra went to Bolivia <foreign> incognito
</foreign> to lead a guerrilla force.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#87:4>
On October 8, 1967, however, the group was almost annihilated by the
Bolivian army.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#88:4>
Guevarra was captured alive.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#89:4>
His captors cut off both his hands and shot him soon afterward. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#90:4>
Guevarra 's revolutionary career may have been brief, but he left
behind a body of written works that are read with much interest and awe by
leftist and progressive movements everywhere.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#91:4>
Today, he is a revered 60s figure who stands as a symbol of
rebellion.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#92:4>
If, 30 years after his death, Che 's memory lives on in the minds of
all those who have at one time or another raised a clenched fist against
established authority, it is because he personifies the conviction that
social change knows no boundaries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#93:4>
A radical theoretician said more than a hundred years ago that
<quote> &ldquo; it is not enough to understand the world, the point is to
change it. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-005#94:4>
But we have Che Guevarra - - and other men and women who made the
supreme sacrifice for change - - to thank for making it possible for the
enterprise of changing the world to be as urgent today as it was more than a
century ago. </p> </I>
