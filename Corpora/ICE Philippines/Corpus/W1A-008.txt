<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#5:1>
<h> <ul> Introduction </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#6:1>
The book recounted how the Roman Catholic Church in the
Philippines and worldwide, as well as some people in the Philippine
government, continuously campaigned to put women in their <quote> &ldquo;
proper places" </quote> , as wives and mothers in society, during the time of
the International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD) in Cairo,
in 1994, and the World Conference on Women in Beijing ( popularly referred to
as the Beijing Conference), in 1995.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#7:1>
In both conferences, the Philippines was an active participant even
during the Preparatory Committee Meetings held within three years of any U.N.
Conference.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#8:1>
The book was enlightening enough not only on the processes involved
during the U.N. Conference, but also on the strategies employed by the
&ldquo; ultra-male &rdquo; institution that is the Roman Catholic Church, in
its attempt to prevent what the Pope viewed as a <quote> &ldquo; culture of
death &rdquo; </quote> being propagated by the Western countries, where
reproductive rights would mean abortion by demand and families would mean
cohabiting homosexuals.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#9:1>
The author wrote down her opinion with fiery fervor and unnerving
candor that borders on the offensive.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#10:1>
Hence, any Roman Catholic woman reader should be prepared for the
experience of demystification of the religion they were made a part of since
birth and whose teachings they hardly questioned as they regularly attended
Sunday masses. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#11:1>
<h> <ul> Highlights of the Book </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#12:1>
Da&ntilde;guilan 's book started off with an introduction and
ended with an epilogue.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#13:1>
The introduction discussed the significance of U.N. Conferences and
the processes involved in the making of such conferences.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#14:1>
The epilogue attempted to rationalize the Church 's rather noxious
dealings and how these have influenced events before and during the
conferences. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#15:1>
The book was divided into five parts each containing related
chapters.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#16:1>
Part I, <it> UN Conferences and the Vatican </it> , had two chapters
and gave the book its context.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#17:1>
Chapter 1 gave a brief history of why the UN organizes population and
development conferences, while chapter 2 explained how the Vatican engineered
its way into the UN. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#18:1>
Part II, <it> Before Cairo </it> , was composed of three
chapters.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#19:1>
Chapter 3 described what took place in the Preparatory Committee (
PrepCom) meetings, particularly PrepCom 3, held before the ICPD ( also
referred as the Cairo Conference).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#20:1>
Chapter 4 discussed what happened after PrepCom 3 and angrily
recounted how the Catholic Church in the Philippines waged a vehement outcry
about the delegates to PrepCom 3, the Cairo Conference itself and the Cairo
document on population and development.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#21:1>
Chapter 5 described the Church-organized rally before the Cairo
Conference and the agreement forged between the Philippine government and the
Church. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#22:1>
Part III, <it> Cairo </it> , contained three chapters.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#23:1>
 Chapter 6 dealt with the start of the Cairo Conference, the major
players in it and what they said in their opening speeches, as well as the
efforts of various participants from the NGOs to influence the Conference.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#24:1>
Chapter 7 discussed the key issues and debates among the countries
represented in the Conference, how they negotiated the minute turns of
phrases and the subtleties of words, how the Vatican derailed the Conference
through its obstinacy, and how the Philippines participated.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#25:1>
Chapter 8 was reflective since it looked back at the entire unfolding
of events after the fury and frenzy, and tried to analyze what actually took
place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#26:1>
Part IV, <it> Manila </it> , had three chapters.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#27:1>
Chapter 9 recounted Pope John Paul II 's second visit to Manila in
January 1995.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#28:1>
Chapter 10 focused on the Philippine tetanus toxoid controversy,
which the Church generated.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#29:1>
Chapter 11 related how Sen. Francisco Tatad 's appointment as chair
of the Senate committee on women and family relations created a big stir
among the women in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#30:1>
Part V, <it> Beijing </it> , is the last part of the book and
contained four chapters.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#31:1>
Chapter 12 described the Vatican 's global campaign against the
Fourth World Conference on Women ( the Beijing Conference) in September 1995.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#32:1>
Chapter 13 recounted how the church and its lay groups in the
Philippines took the cue from the Vatican and lambasted the Beijing
Conference, and how the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (
NCRFW), the Catholic sisters, women from the academe and women NGOs, fought
back.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#33:1>
Chapter 14 related how the Philippine government and women NGOs
prepared for the Beijing Conference and how they agreed to work together on
certain flagship issues.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#34:1>
Chapter 15, the final chapter, described the discussions during the
Beijing Conference and related how Church pressure was again exerted. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#35:1>
<h> <ul> Analysis </ul> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#36:1>
<h> <it> Contributions to Gender, Sexuality and Reproductive Health
and Rights </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#37:1>
The book directly dealt with concepts and issues on sexuality,
gender, reproductive health and reproductive rights, particularly of women.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#38:1>
The author chronicled how these concepts became integrated in
pertinent international conference documents that serve as guidelines for
individual state implementation at the national level.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#39:1>
The readers were provided with clarifications and conceptual
definitions, as well as the debates on relevant issues surrounding gender,
sexuality, reproductive health and reproductive rights.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#40:1>
The author 's reference to actual document paragraphs concretely
grounds such concepts and issues by calling to mind that gender, sexuality,
reproductive health and reproductive rights have ceased to remain in the
realm of theory and have become widely recognized as realities that need to
be addressed by governments.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#41:1>
Hence, the book is peppered by issues like violence against women,
reproductive choices pertaining to fertility control, access to reproductive
health services, male responsibility in fertility management, the rights of
the girl child and adolescent reproductive health, among others, as these
were part of the key points discussed in the narrated international
conferences.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#42:1>
The main theme of the book, however, was the Roman Catholic Church 's
active involvement in efforts to disrupt the gains of women in the arena of
international recognition of women 's issues or concerns.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#43:1>
In particular, the book lengthily and insightfully discusses how
religion, especially Roman Catholicism, becomes a major factor in the
suppression of women 's sexuality and reproductive rights.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#44:1>
Such insights touched on the global and local ( Philippine) contexts
and thus showcased how an inherently &ldquo; male &rdquo; institution like
the Catholic Church bend over backwards ( like starting the controversy on
the tetanus toxoid as an abortifacient) just to maintain a semblance of its
perceived &ldquo; natural &rdquo; <foreign> status quo </foreign> with
regards &ldquo; women 's roles &rdquo; as wives and mothers. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#45:1>
<it> <it> The Book 's Strengths and Weaknesses </it> </it>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#46:1>
One strength of the book is its provision of historical <foreign>
milieu </foreign> for the recent recognition of women 's issues
internationally, particularly in the UN, as well as the events that led to
the Vatican 's participation in UN Conferences.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#47:1>
Thus, the readers are provided with chronological account of global
changes where women 's issues are concerned, starting from the first
International Conference on Population and Development and the first World
Conference on Women, to the declaration of the Decade of Women ( 1975-1985),
the Cairo ICPD and the Beijing Conference.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#48:1>
Significant events that happened in the intervening years were also
narrated and all these helped in contextualizing the arguments raised in the
book. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#49:1>
The author, as pointed out in the foreword written by Rina
Jimenez-David, is not associated with any women 's group or organized
ideological orientation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#50:1>
This proves to be an advantage since discerning readers cannot fault
her for propagating certain group agenda and she thus comes off as a genuine
personal advocate of women 's health and reproductive rights.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#51:1>
Her actual attendance to the conferences described in the book (
including the PrepComs) and academic background as a medical doctor likewise
lends her added credibility in espousing her ideas and opinions, to those who
think such factors like educational attainment, matters.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#52:1>
Moreover, the author has a very clear writing style and this served
her in good stead in terms of communicating her ideas and opinions to the
readers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#53:1>
Her display of witticisms throughout the book painted the Catholic
Church as hilarious.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#54:1>
Her dab at illustrating the logic employed by the Church and its avid
following ( pp. 55, 63, 134) not only exhibited a perceptive mind but also
successfully showed the rather skewed associations that run through the
Church 's stance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#55:1>
The very same writing style of the author, however, may be the
source of weakness of the book, especially in the realm of advocacy work.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#56:1>
I would like to personally believe that the book was written more to
promote the recognition and acceptance of women 's reproductive health and
rights rather than the personal venting out of a conference insider who may
have problems with her religion.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#57:1>
As such, the strong opinions against the Catholic Church evident
throughout the book may enlighten some people but may also offend some.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#58:1>
The pointed remarks which I found to be in order and even funny may
produce cognitive dissonance to Catholic readers who, prior to reading the
book, have never questioned the moral ascendancy of the Church, even in
matters pertaining to sexuality and reproductive choices.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#59:1>
So while the likelihood that many lay people may not end up reading
the book, the fact that it was published means that it has been circulated
and the theme and style may have weakened its utility as an advocacy
material. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#60:1>
Notwithstanding the perceived weakness of the book, I think that
its theme and language actually manifest that changes are being made in the
realm of gender, sexuality, reproductive health and reproductive rights.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#61:1>
The book 's reference to the obvious resistance of the Catholic
Church in the international adoption of certain concepts like different forms
of families, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, sexual orientation,
adolescent reproductive health, among others, indicates that forces are now
at work to change the prevailing social order.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#62:1>
The Church 's resistance is therefore to be expected and should be
addressed accordingly.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#63:1>
After all, the Catholic Church is a bastion of patriarchal ideology,
where justification for women 's subordinate status still stem from the
rather lame excuse that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was born male and had
male disciples. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#64:1>
<h> <it> On the issue of Vatican &ldquo; power &rdquo; in the UN
</it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#65:1>
Aside from my overall appreciation of the book, I would like to
take note of Chapter 2, which I found to be personally intriguing and
relevant to the cause of women 's reproductive rights.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#66:1>
The said chapter dealt with technicalities for UN membership and
observer status qualifications---things I learned in my undergraduate
disciplinal background.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#67:1>
What I have come to understand in Political Science which I likewise
teach to my students is the basic definition of a state, and that it consists
of four basic elements: a defined territory, people, government and
sovereignty.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#68:1>
Only states become members of the UN and the status of observer is
conferred to those who do not meet state qualifications, or those with
peculiar status.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#69:1>
An example of an observer state is Switzerland, which by virtue of
its being a neutral country, cannot be a full-fledged member of an
organization that can get involved in wars ( I think Palestine is also an
observer since it is still not considered a state because its territorial
claim is yet to be settled).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#70:1>
In connection with this, the status of &ldquo; permanent observer
&rdquo; has been accorded to Switzerland in 1946 after it named a permanent
observer in the UN and the secretary general accepted the designation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#71:1>
Henceforth, the &ldquo; permanent observer &rdquo; status has been
customarily acknowledged, although the UN Charter has no provisions on such
status.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#72:1>
In the case of the Vatican, the Lateran Pacts of 1929 signed by then
Pope Pius XI and Mussolini gave the Pope his little piece of ground, Vatican
City, in which he is to be the master.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#73:1>
The said pacts embodied a treaty and agreement between the Pope and
the Italian state regarding the control of ecclesiastical matters.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#74:1>
That was how the Vatican became a state although unlike any modern
state, the Vatican city-state does not exist to support its citizens.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#75:1>
Its main purpose is to serve as the site of the central
administration of the Roman Catholic Church, to administer its properties and
to ensure the ecclesiastical independence of the Holy See ( the Pope 's
diocese, which includes not just the Vatican but also Rome).

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#76:1>
In 1964, then Pope Paul VI named a &ldquo; permanent observer &rdquo;
to the UN and since the Holy See has been participating in UN Conferences
since the 1950s, the UN Secretary General accepted the designation.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#77:1>
All these were narrated in pages 17-18 of the book while in page 19,
the recent development of according voting privilege to permanent observers
was noted.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#78:1>
Thus, the Holy See was able to vote in recent conferences.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#79:1>
Aside from this, the fact that the UN strives to achieve consensus to
avoid relying on votes in the adoption of documents gave the Holy See the
ability not only to vote but also to block consensus.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#80:1>
Universal knowledge on consensus building, as likewise pointed out in
page 19, allows minority views-even a single one---to have a voice in the
proceedings.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#81:1>
In line with this, Da&ntilde;guilan narrated in pages 19-21, the
efforts of certain international networks to petition and lobby for the
withdrawal of the permanent observer status of the Holy See on the basis that
it acts more as a religious body rather than a state, thus promulgating
religious viewpoints.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#82:1>
As such, the inappropriateness and negative effects of allowing the
Holy See to use the UN system to advance the theological positions of the
Catholic Church has been demonstrated over and over again.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#83:1>
Petitions, however, have not been able to drive the Holy See out of
the UN.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#84:1>
So while the Pope 's pronouncements and other Catholic publications
emphasize that the Holy See comes from a spiritual position and therefore
finds itself at odds with the secular, political nature of the UN, it still
continues to enjoy being a non-member state permanent observer.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#85:1>
Quoting from Da&ntilde;guilan, for how long will the Catholic Church
have this privilege, we can only surmise. </p> </I> <&> Additional text,
beyond the 2000 words </&>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#86:1>
The fact that the author touches on such aspect of the
controversies raised by the Church is I think noteworthy and may also be
regarded as a strength of the book.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#87:1>
The author deftly implied that we should start questioning the
&ldquo; power &rdquo; enjoyed by the Holy See in the UN, and even of our own
Philippine Church hierarchy vis-à-vis governmental decision-making and
personal choices made by real women confronted by real circumstances.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#88:1>
Thus, realizing that the authority of the Pope and the Church on
matters pertaining to women 's reproductive health is actually very
questionable ( after all, they do not get pregnant), women and even men,
inspired by knowledge gained from reading books like Da&ntilde;guilan 's,
should start to rethink their religious adherence and maybe even start to
mobilize.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#89:1>
When this happens, perhaps within this century, about six centuries
after the medieval ages, the Roman Catholic Church will begin to veer away
from outdated and unfounded &ldquo; dogma &rdquo; and start to &ldquo;
de-bracket &rdquo; women 's issues---not only in documents but in concrete
everyday circumstances.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#90:1>
For women 's empowerment includes their freedom to make choices
pertaining to their bodies---their sexuality and reproductive health.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#91:1>
Such choices are personal and no institution should impinge on that
right of choice.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#92:1>
So, while the Virgin Mary serves as the unrealistic model whom the
Church endorses for women to emulate, I cannot help but concur with what Rina
Jimenez-David wrote in her newspaper column way back in 1994: <quote> &ldquo;
Even God asked Mary 's permission before He got her pregnant" </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-008#93:1>
In light of the book reviewed, I think that such insight is the
clearest manifestation of reproductive rights that the Catholic Church should
be reminded of. </p>
</I>
