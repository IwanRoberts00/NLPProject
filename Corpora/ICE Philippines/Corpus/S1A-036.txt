<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#24:1:B>
Yes of course

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#25:1:A>
So how how was it
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#26:1:A>
It was very quiet

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#27:1:B>
Quiet
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#28:1:B>
I said my rosary I talked to him

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#29:1:A>
<indig> Oo </indig> <&> B laughs </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#30:1:B>
And then we had a very nice dinner at <mention> Katre
 </mention> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#31:1:A>
Yeah was it good was it good

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#32:1:B>
It was good
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#33:1:B>
It was very very well presented <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#34:1:B>
The presentation was so good <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> but then I noticed
whatever you order it looks the same
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#35:1:B>
It 's everything practically looks the same so that 's the one <{3> 
 <[3> <,> </[3> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#36:1:A>
<[1> <indig> Oo </indig> </[1> </{1> <[2> Uh oh </[2> </{2> 
 <[3> The styling </[3> </{3> the styling <{> <[> of the food </[> <indig> oo

<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#37:1:A>
But the food was good

<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#38:1:B>
<[> <indig> Oo </indig> the styling </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#39:1:B>
Yes but the servings you know the servings were small

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#40:1:A>
Were small
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#41:1:A>
Uh so the prices are not reasonable

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#42:1:B>
The price is reasonable maybe that 's the reason <{> <[> the
the </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#43:1:A>
<[> Oh I </[> </{> almost forgot we have to pick up Telly

 <$B>

The lady went to the bathroom and took a bath <{> <[> <,> </[> and
so I was waiting there chatting with one of my friends <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#52:1:B>
And then I said oh my gosh I 'll be late
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#53:1:B>
So I said give give me a little sh sh sh <&> spraying sound; A

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#54:1:A>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#65:1:A>
No no no

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#66:1:B>
She should bring the pictures 'cause you can hardly I said who 's
this and it 's she <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#67:1:B>
'Cause <{> <[> she 's all loaded </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#68:1:A>
<[> She 's all bundled up </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#69:1:B>
And then the funny thing is she has that scarf across her face
like that <{> <[> because it </[> was so cold

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#70:1:A>
<[> Oh my God </[> </{> because of the wind chill

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#71:1:B>
And I said wow all of you <{> <[> all of you </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#72:1:A>
<[> Where did they go </[> </{> in China

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#73:1:B>
<indig> Ay </indig> it was a beautiful trip according to her
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#74:1:B>
She said there were ice sculptures
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#75:1:B>
And the ice sculptures were huge

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#76:1:A>
Oh I see
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#77:1:A>
I hope she brings the pictures

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#78:1:B>
Because she brought the pictures and showed them to me <{> <[> 
 <,> </[> and I said okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#79:1:B>
Oh why I would have wanted to go with her but it was very very
sudden and Bubut was in town

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#80:1:A>
<[> <indig> Oo oo </indig> </[> </{> okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#81:1:B>
Okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#82:1:B>
The guy remember I refused to continue <{> <[> with </[> the <w> 
nuns' </w> group
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#83:1:B>
The guy agreed I think to continue with the group <{> <[> <,> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#84:1:B>
He he meets them three times a week

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#85:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#86:1:A>
<[> Uh okay </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#87:1:A>
That 's a lot of work <O> laughs </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#88:1:B>
It 's a lot of work three times a week three hours
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#89:1:B>
But you know the thing is it 's easier for him than for me 'cause
he does the written phase <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> so when they write he can sit
down <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and rest
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#90:1:B>
I you ask <{3> <[3> Telly </[3> how she felt when she was listening
to me <O> laughs </O> she said

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#91:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#92:1:A>
<[> Rest <indig> oo oo </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#93:1:A>
<[> <indig> Oo nga </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#94:1:A>
She was more tired than you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#95:1:B>
She was definitely more tired than I because I was you know my
adrenaline was pumping <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> because here is this group of
seven nice nuns and I wanted to find out how much I can do really <{2> <[2> 
 <,> </[2> but it 's too much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#96:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#97:1:A>
<[2> Uh hum </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#98:1:A>
I thought Annabelle Lee would have handled the class <,> she has
 <{> <[> no patience </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#99:1:B>
<[> Telly didn't </[> </{> I don't know Telly said if she
handles it then I will have to worry about it <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#100:1:B>
And so she wanted me to handle it first <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#101:1:B>
I said Telly you know I tried <indig> ha </indig> I 've been a
very good girl <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#102:1:B>
I tried and she she almost faints <indig> siguro </indig> almost
fainted <O> laughs </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#103:1:B>
<indig> Ay </indig> Telly let her tell you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#104:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh okay </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#105:1:A>
<[2> <indig> Oo </indig> </[2> </{2> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#106:1:A>
<[3> <indig> Oo oo </indig> </[3> </{3> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#107:1:B>
<indig> Ay </indig> gosh but the thing is when when the guy
showed me the written work it was so good yes <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> it 's
almost poetic <{2> <[2> the language is almost poetic </[2> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#108:1:A>
<[1> Uh really <indig> ha </indig> </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#109:1:A>
<[2> So it 's really just practice </[2> </{2> they need practice

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#110:1:B>
It 's the mouth and the ears

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#111:1:A>
<indig> Oo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#112:1:A>
So <{> <[> that means they are </[> reading a lot I guess in China

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#113:1:B>
<[> It 's the oral phase </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#114:1:B>
I think so yes yes yes and they are reading but when you talk to
them they can hardly understand you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#115:1:B>
You have to speak very slowly and even then they cannot understand
you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#116:1:B>
So you have to write go to the board I have to write every word
almost every word I would say

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#117:1:A>
Oh my gosh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#118:1:A>
<indig> Oo </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#119:1:B>
I said okay let 's talk about opposites
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#120:1:B>
<mention> Opposite opposite </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#121:1:B>
Then they would check their dictionaries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#122:1:B>
Each one had a dictionary you know <{> <[> <,> </[> computerized
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#123:1:B>
Ahh I see <O> laughs </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#124:1:A>
<[> <indig> Oo oo </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#125:1:A>
Computerized <.> dic </.> so in their <.> compu </.> <indig> ano
 </indig> they had laptops with them

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#126:1:B>
That small thing <{> <[> uhh </[> I think they were equipped
so that in case they have to ask questions
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#127:1:B>
I haven't said good-bye to them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#128:1:B>
I said <indig> o </indig> Telly I haven't said good-bye to them
and because I want to tell the reason why I cannot continue with them is I
don't know <O> laughs </O> I have to think of a nice reason

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#129:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#130:1:A>
<O> laughs </O> It 's too much work

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#131:1:B>
Uh I don't know

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#132:1:A>
So Telly reports every day

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#133:1:B>
No no no three times M W F <X> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#X134:1:B>

know the house okay </X> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#135:1:A>
And then she 's traveling again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#136:1:A>
<{> <[> She 'll be visiting </[> her sister and her brothers

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#141:1:A>
And is she going back to La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#142:1:A>
She won't anymore

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#143:1:B>
I don't know I haven't pinned her down <{> <[> <,> </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#144:1:B>
You know why should she not go back

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#145:1:A>
<[> <indig> Oo </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#146:1:A>
Well if this one is so close and <,> uh <{> <[> it 's less stress
 </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#147:1:B>
<[> But how much </[> </{> would they pay her here how much

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#148:1:A>
She doesn't need the money

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#149:1:B>
Everybody needs the money <&> A laughs </&> don't tell me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#150:1:A>
No she doesn't need the money
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#151:1:A>
She needs a quiet life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#152:1:A>
We 'll ask her

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#153:1:B>
But uh this is too quiet for her

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#154:1:A>
Uh it 's too quiet for her

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#155:1:B>
I would think so no no no and intellectual <{> <[> <,> 
intellectual what intellectual stimulation </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#156:1:A>
<[> Ohh no excitement no no adrenaline </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#157:1:A>
The challenge is not there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#158:1:B>
<indig> Oo </indig> is not there because my my children were
asking me <indig> o </indig> Mommy how is St Mary 's as compared to La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#159:1:B>
Oh there 's no comparison it 's a provincial place <{1> <[1> <,> 
 </[1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#160:1:B>
It 's very cute because the children you see the children running
around <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> but it 's quiet that 's it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#161:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#163:1:B>
The your excitement is how to contain twelve freshman students
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#164:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#166:1:B>
Yes I am because I told them you cannot be skittish like high
school

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#167:1:A>
Would they know what <mention> skittish </mention> means

<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#168:1:B>

<[> Is he the one </[> </{> with a problem

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#223:1:C>
You know I hope I don't meet him anymore

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#224:1:A>
<{> <[> Why </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#225:1:B>
<[> Why </[> </{> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#226:1:C>
Because I called him when the rumors were circulating
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#227:1:C>
I called him <@> Benjie </@> what is this rumor I 'm hearing about
you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#228:1:C>
And then he says <indig> Hindi ko nga ho alam ba't ginaganito nila
ako e </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#229:1:C>
I don't know why they 're doing this to <{> <[> me </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#230:1:C>
You mean there 's no truth to that rumor
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#231:1:C>
<indig> Wala sabi niya </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#232:1:C>
So I 'll go there on November and follow up my papers personally
and find out why they 're giving me a problem with my papers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#233:1:C>
So

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#234:1:A>
<[> Oh my God </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#235:1:A>
Oh my God when did you call him

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#236:1:C>
About a month <{> <[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#237:1:A>
<[> Before November </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#238:1:A>
When did you start hearing the rumor

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#239:1:C>
Probably <{> <[> August </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#240:1:B>
<[> Did somebody </[> </{> check bother to check

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#241:1:C>
Yeah Lita wrote <@> Stanford </@> University
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#242:1:C>
But you know the the funny thing is Wyona <indig> yon hindi ba
 </indig> before the Dean uh works on the papers before the appointment is
done and <unclear> 2 words </unclear> committee the V P A clears the papers
 <indig> di ba tapos noon </indig> go on and hire
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#243:1:C>
So we assumed that <{> <[> <,> </[> Wyona did all the background
checking otherwise she would not have told us okay go on and hire <@> Benjie
Rebullida </@> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#244:1:C>
So we hired him and I we we gave him Associate four which is only
for P H D holders
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#245:1:C>
<indig> Tapos ni- </indig> recommend <indig> ko pa na </indig> 
professorial chair holder

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#246:1:B>
<[> It was cleared </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#247:1:A>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#248:1:A>
He was so promising so bright <{> <[> <,> </[> very bright

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#249:1:C>
<[> <indig> Oo oo </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#250:1:C>
And then so I was told that somebody from abroad came and
mentioned that to the International Studies people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#251:1:C>
But I didn't believe because I called <@> Benjie </@> and he
denied not having a P H D

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#252:1:B>
And did he show anything

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#253:1:C>
No so we went over his papers and uh they you know the people
from <@> Stanford </@> didn't say he does not have a P H D

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#254:1:B>
<indig> Ha </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#255:1:C>
<indig> Oo </indig> that 's why Wyona gave him they cleared
his name but they didn't mention that he has no P H D so we I I Wyona must
have assumed that <{> <[> <,> </[> okay and then Lita wrote

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#256:1:B>
<[> Strange <indig> 'no </indig> </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#257:1:A>
Didn't <@> Stanford </@> say he 's a graduate or <{> <[> 
something like that </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#258:1:C>
<[> No no no <indig> basta </indig> </[> </{> they cleared
name <indig> niya </indig> but not the degree

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#259:1:B>
What do you mean by <mention> cleared </mention> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#260:1:C>
That he has no problems

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#261:1:B>
But what you are interested in is <{> <[> his degree </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#262:1:A>
<[> It was a </[> </{> character reference it was a character
reference

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#263:1:C>
Yeah a character reference
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#264:1:C>
I don't know what Wyona asked but that was the paper <{> <[> that
I saw </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#265:1:C>
And so Lita finally wrote and was told he has no P H D

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#266:1:B>
<[> Oh my </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#267:1:B>
That he does not <{> <[> have categorically </[> he does not have
a P H D

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#268:1:C>
<[> <indig> Wala </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#269:1:C>
A P H D <&> break in recording </&> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#270:1:B>
Was he working on his dissertation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#271:1:B>
Did he have an academic

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#272:1:C>
I think he had a problem with his adviser
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#273:1:C>
That was what all of these

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#274:1:B>
Usually it comes out

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#275:1:A>
It was speculation already

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#276:1:C>
<indig> Oo </indig> all of these were rumors rumors

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#277:1:B>
<indig> Oo </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#278:1:A>
<indig> O </indig> where is he now

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#279:1:C>
He 's still with La Salle <{> <[> <,> </[> paying back
everything
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#280:1:C>
So <indig> hindi ba </indig> we paid him uh the rate of the
Associate four

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#281:1:B>
<[> <indig> Ha </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#282:1:B>
What 's he paying back

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#283:1:C>
<indig> E di sobra yung ano </indig> he was his rank was
changed now so he was made <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> Associate <indig> siya 'no
 </indig> now he was made Assistant Prof
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#284:1:C>
And so he 's paying now the difference between Assistant and <{2> 
 <[2> <,> </[2> the Chair also four thousand five hundred

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#285:1:A>
<[1> Associate </[1> </{1> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#286:1:A>
<[2> And the Chair </[2> </{2> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#287:1:B>
Oh my gosh
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#288:1:B>
It 's a wonder that he still sticks around

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#289:1:C>
<indig> Sabi ko </indig> I hope I don't meet him <O> all
laugh </O> <indig> ba't naman pati yung </indig> I called him <indig> 'no
 </indig> and said this is very confidential
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#290:1:C>
Will you please tell me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#291:1:C>
He said he has a P H D

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#292:1:A>
Oh my gosh

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#293:1:C>
You know I it was <@> Manolo </@> who recommended him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#294:1:C>
<indig> Hindi ba </indig> <@> Manolo </@> went abroad so then he
brings this <@> Benjie Rebullida </@> and he says <indig> o </indig> he has a
P H D tatata tatata make sure we don't lose him tatata tatata so <indig> ako
naman </indig> I worked fast and we hired him

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#295:1:B>
At Lyceum I always told do not take any word of any man or
woman who claims to have a P H D if there is no paper attached
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#296:1:B>
<indig> Kasi </indig> I 've learned that early enough in my career
as a Dean

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#297:1:C>
I think you know Wyona I have a feeling that Wyona considers
 <@> Manolo </@> 's word <indig> parang </indig> the guarantee

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#298:1:B>
Uh no no no

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#299:1:C>
<indig> Ayan ayan </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#300:1:B>
This is not the first time that it happened in De La Salle
 <indig> di ba </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#301:1:C>
In Liberal Arts

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#302:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#303:1:A>
Several cases I guess but I cannot cannot remember a case

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#304:1:B>
I usually would tell uh uh Paulino I already told you be very
very careful
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#305:1:B>
As it has strung me once and I will never forget that <{> <[> <,> 
 </[> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#306:1:B>
And you 'll recall that was only one person that said she
graduated as an honor student at U P

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#307:1:C>
<[> <indig> Oo oo </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#308:1:C>
<indig> Oo oo </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#309:1:C>
But you know <@> Benjie </@> I think didn't apply
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#310:1:C>
It was <@> Manolo </@> who encouraged him to join La Salle

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#311:1:B>
All you need is
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#312:1:B>
<indig> Hindi ba </indig> when I applied at De La Salle <indig> 
kumpleto ang </indig> papers <indig> pati </indig> transcript <indig> ko
 </indig> plus the diploma

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#313:1:C>
<indig> Hay naku </indig> I really don't like to see <@> 
Benjie </@> anymore because I called him I called him

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#314:1:B>
<indig> Hindi ba si </indig> <@> Santos </@> also
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#315:1:B>
Remember that <@> Santos </@> guy the one who sang with the
Chorale French computer <indig> ba </indig> computer

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#316:1:A>
Ahh <@> Carlo </@> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#317:1:B>
<@> Carlo </@> <indig> oo nga </indig> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#318:1:C>
He didn't have a P H D also

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#319:1:A>
He did not defend his dissertation or something

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#320:1:B>
And yet when people called him <mention> Doctor </mention> he
didn't correct them

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#321:1:A>
And he was Dean

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#322:1:C>
So the latest is Brother Andrew uh is giving him I don't know
how true this is <indig> 'no </indig> up to the end of uh this school year to
finish <{> <[> <,> </[> to finish his P H D

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#323:1:B>
<[> To pay </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#324:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#325:1:C>
I don't <.> kn </.> <@> Stanford </@> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#326:1:B>
Go back <indig> ganoon </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#327:1:A>
But has he defended his dissertation and all he needs is to
revise

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#328:1:C>
You know that 's what I don't know I I don't know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#329:1:B>
We don't know <indig> kasi ba't ganoon walang klaro </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#330:1:A>
Funny <indig> naman </indig> <@> Stanford </@> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#331:1:C>
I didn't see the letter of <@> Stanford </@> to Lita but that
was what Lita told me <indig> wala siyang </indig> P H D
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-036#332:1:C>
That 's why he 's paying back </I>
