Uh Mr President uh honorable colleagues today the Senate is
blessed with this historical moment faced again with responsibility and
opportunity to be able to choose in these times of widespread discord and
national prerogative that has a concrete bearing on how we can preserve our
sovereignty and the security of every Filipino
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#2:1:A>
Reflected in this document are workable solutions providing for the
very existence of our Republic in a world besotted with conflict rage and
insecurities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#3:1:A>
This document will not only be the source of foreign policy
direction the Republic or this administration has to take but it will without
doubt confer us the necessary framework to prevail over waves of changes that
will engulf the unwitting and the ill-prepared
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#4:1:A>
This document has been the source of bitter exchanges personal
attacks and harsh pronouncements within this hallowed chamber and even out in
the street the other parliament
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#5:1:A>
Every channel has been opened so that clashing viewpoints would be
heard not only in the exercise of the inherent and constitutionally
guaranteed right to freedom of expression
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#6:1:A>
The <?> state </?> maintains open channels because it seeks the
wisdom from what is spoken not just from the bombast
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#7:1:A>
We all let it loose so each one every senator casting a vote the
citizen ventilating concerns can find the appropriate care and define the
balance of national interest and foreign policy initiatives on what could be
the end of the post cold war years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#8:1:A>
In a republican state international agreements are appropriately
subjected to intense debate because these cannot and should not be crafted on
the basis of the whims of the executive
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#9:1:A>
The R P Visiting Forces Agreement is not just simply about military
exercises nor of nuclear weapons nor of ugly Americans or of prostitutes
neither merely of ravaged environments and menace of drugs and disease it is
all this and more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#10:1:A>
The resulting interplay of economic politico-military and
socio-cultural forces in a new global dynamic shall determine how the V F A
and those who shall father it are branded or remembered irrelevant or
relevant subservient or nationalist
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#11:1:A>
The debates have all prepared us for this task and warned us enough
how to bear the consanses consequences of our vote <unclear> words </unclear> 
and immediately and far-off into the future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#12:1:A>
Although they had the chance in nineteen eighty-six the framers of
our Constitution did not reject American presence outright
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#13:1:A>
The framers of our Constitution sought a balance of patriotism and
pragmatism consciously
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#14:1:A>
They so worded foreign policy and the transitory provisions to the
nineteen eighty-seven Constitution to allow us to savor the challenge of this
historic vote
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#15:1:A>
They did not find wisdom in taking away the options of the
executive towards enhancing national security and assuring peace with our
shores within our shores
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#16:1:A>
The Senate on the other hand also found enough reason to wait out
to wait it out for four years in nineteen ninety-one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#17:1:A>
The Senate did not extend the <w> bases' </w> stay they plainly let
the R P - U S sem um M B A lapse
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#18:1:A>
When the last ships of Americans and their dependents left eight
years ago the people in the Senate these same hallowed ch chambers left one
of the foundations of future Filipino-American relations the Mutual Defense
Treaty intact unchanged unchallenged
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#19:1:A>
But today more than ever we know and feel it in our guts that we
need a new framework to put more meaning and muscle to commitments under the
R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty a treaty that we did not abrogate a treaty
which the people rejoiced the ejection of the American bases did not press to
abrogate even with three changing of the guards in Congress
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#20:1:A>
I believe the decision made today should be based on the most
important factor national security defined correctly and in the long term
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#21:1:A>
External defense and the protection of territorial boundaries not
only not only external defense and protection of the territorial boundaries
but also increasingly of economic security in a world directed towards
globalization where peace assures us and our neighbors equitable use of
resources in the region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#22:1:A>
As human contact across oceans reach new levels and frequencies
just recently unimaginable we now realize that we are interconnected not only
in the physical sense but in the plane of changing international morality
played out in interregional and global engagements
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#23:1:A>
Foreign relation initiatives must reflect the correct appraisal of
the values of alliances
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#24:1:A>
It is easy to claim that one is against war and easier still to
invoke the Constitution which renounces war as an instrument of national
policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#25:1:A>
However I believe no responsible leader can play blind to real and
potential threats to peace equality justice freedom cooperation and amity
with all nations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#26:1:A>
It is not enough to denounce aggressors and it is fatal to be an
island by itself
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#27:1:A>
We should not be trapped in the web of insecurities ab attributed
to being neutral
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#28:1:A>
Neither should we <?> couch </?> as to throw ourselves into the
camp of the bigger bully as if wishing that another holocaust will break up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#29:1:A>
We have to wield foreign relations instrument to reap the benefits
of a security continuum which allow us to struggle <&> should be juggle </&> 
arrangements and employ initiatives ranging from one that is entirely neutral
to that of dependence to a superior power depending on the need of the times
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#30:1:A>
We have to take a calculated pace in this security continuum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#31:1:A>
Basic to finding the reasons to confront options in this security
continuum is having the courage to face new and emerging configurations of
the new global dynamic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#32:1:A>
And after a continuing assessment of the new global dynamic to
slowly but surely enter multilateral and bilateral arrangements geared
towards self-reliance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#33:1:A>
I understand why others find comfort in old patterns characterized
mainly by unequal ties betwan between the Philippines and the United States
and as breaking away much later
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#34:1:A>
There too was comfort in the belief that the U S what that this
threshold of declining influence in the initial embarrassments and the very
vivid images of its pull-out from Vietnam handling of this whole hostage
situation in Iran and its being booted out from the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#35:1:A>
The image of the U S on the brink of collapse was reassuring the
favorite line was that the U S enjoying a peak would soon in a rage bring
down itself and its allies in a war of its own undoing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#36:1:A>
Likewise the U S S R 's grip of its satellite was slowly slipping
after it went into a wave of changes. The rising nationalism of U S S R 's
component republics led to the formal internment in nineteen ninety-two of an
ailing Soviet empire
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#37:1:A>
The end of the post cold war was carved deeply into men 's minds
when the one raging symbol of the cold war the Berlin Wall was pick-axed and
bulldozed in eight in nineteen eighty-nine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#38:1:A>
The mad men 's game of the arms race was gone the cold war was over
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#39:1:A>
And Mr President we pretended being secure within our shores
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#40:1:A>
We lulled in the feeling we that had an even chance of having peace
after breaking the suffocating yoke of a former colonizer and its only rival
splinter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#41:1:A>
A period of disengagements the integration reassertion of political
and cultural independence erasing old spheres of influence of the great
powers characterized what we commonly term the post cold war world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#42:1:A>
This was a unique period in modern history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#43:1:A>
No big war was dividing the world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#44:1:A>
The various causes were fought by swift troop attacks including
government-funded mercenaries and terrorists
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#45:1:A>
That stretch of time so the great powers waging battles that were
still about controlling continents without the use of the giant talents of
armies which constituted the panorama of the two world wars
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#46:1:A>
This period showed the enlargement of the the demec democratic
world in the U S efforts in Panama the break-up of the Soviet Empire and
China 's political reforms
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#47:1:A>
The two Germanys reunited while other <.> Eur </.> European
republics splintered into smaller nations
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#48:1:A>
The Soviets rev uh withdrew from Cuba Middle East conflicts
simmered to the accord between Israel and Palestinian Liberation Organization
and in the meantime Mr President that democratic space expanded in Turkey and
other Eurasian states
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#49:1:A>
The manifestations that this period will not hold and was only
temporary was present but we failed to read through the fine print muddled as
we are and merely stared at the unfolding of the tapestry of global events
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#50:1:A>
The post cold war world was headed to a conclusion
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#51:1:A>
Kosovo may just have done it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#52:1:A>
I subscribe to the analysis that we are coasting through to the
conclusion of an <foreign> interregnum </foreign> a gap between two tempests
the crumbling of the Berlin Wall and Madeleine 's war
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#53:1:A>
A lot of us gathered here missed the <foreign> interregnum
 </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#54:1:A>
Unbeknownst to us we also just managed to exist in a superficial
peace without exerting any efforts to craft a comprehensive foreign policy
relevant to the security of the <w> Filipinos' </w> future
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#55:1:A>
The importance of the crumbling of the Berlin Wall in geopolitics
was lost on us as the Aquino administration used it only to shame local
insurgents
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#56:1:A>
If not for the large army of Filipino workers the government would
have also looked the other way when Iraq 's ins expansionist wars in the
nineties had to be stopped by United Nations-sanctioned Desert Shield and its
bombardment in Desert Storm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#57:1:A>
These two events should have signaled the Aquino cabinet to
immediately craft and strategize on an independent foreign policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#58:1:A>
Then we would have had the opportunity to that <&> should be thus
 </&> nullify the old valid charge of the great nationalist Claro M Recto that
the Philippines has a mendicant foreign policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#59:1:A>
This also explains why we are lost with the impact of the
realignments in the post cold war world
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#60:1:A>
The government missed the signals that was alerting us to the
possibility that the superficial peace being savored will be broken
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#61:1:A>
The wars in far-off shores are impacting on us while swelling wars
inside our <w> neighbors' </w> <.> yar </.> yards are threatening whatever
was holding peace
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#62:1:A>
Until nineteen ninety-eight the United States the only remaining
super power had worried about Serbia Iraq and North Korea
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#63:1:A>
Currently it is forced to reckon with the strength of Russia France
Japan and China
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#64:1:A>
Russia is now in the process of <.> reu </.> reunification with the
fragment of its old Soviet empire
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#65:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-eight Russia found a center of gravity in
anti-Americanism sparked by the unannounced U S bombing of Iraq driving a
wedge into the Russian psyche that power to spoil U S actions had slipped
away
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#66:1:A>
Powerlessness was the <w> Russians' </w> collective shame because
the returns were never realized
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#67:1:A>
The in-flow of American investments and loans had drastically
constricted therefore it sought a reattachment with China a renewed alliance
with China will counter aggressive U S pressures to acquire increasingly
Russian economic cooperation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#68:1:A>
The U S now has to consider France after its effort exhibited in
Iraq
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#69:1:A>
It may be the U S forces that are leading NATO forces but it does
not monopolize the directions and the ultimate conclusion of the Serbian
drama
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#70:1:A>
Japan poses another challenge to the U S despite clearly securing
its sovereign through American military presence its independent assessment
of the North Korean threat already felt in Pentagon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#71:1:A>
Meanwhile China let cannot let its economy weaken or be
artificially propped up
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#72:1:A>
It wants to emerge to be a stabilizing factor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#73:1:A>
The most conservative of U S policy makers appreciating the global
aspiration for peace reflect this in their recommendations as follows
safeguard U S national security through a non-proliferation policy on nuclear
weapons prevent a major power threat to Europe East Asia or the Persian Gulf
through a U S permanent power position in the Pacific maintain access to
foreign trade through NAFTA and actively seek open markets to benefit
American consumers and exporters protect Americans against threats to their
lives and well-being by decisive action against terrorists and international
crime syndicates maintain access to resources the most strategic of which is
foreign oil which supplies half of American needs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#74:1:A>
I find the enumeration very revealing Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#75:1:A>
They are all realizable only if a peace holds
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#76:1:A>
Mr President who would have thought that the giant responsible for
decades of anti-capitalist propaganda and one of the foremost critic of the
Western money economy would one day hold a free-market superpower America
perplexed at the power of its own currency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#77:1:A>
Who would dared <&> should be would have dared </&> imagine the
Western currency speculators included that China could hold by its pocket an
America fearing the slightest movement of the U N
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#78:1:A>
China underwent two massive disarmaments and later switched from an
old-time preparedness against a large-scale war of aggression to peacetime
construction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#79:1:A>
Its defense budget is minuscule compared to the other great powers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#80:1:A>
Mr President worldwide it is cooperating in the U N and in other
multilateral initiatives designed to control the spread of nuclear weapons
prevent arms race in outer space destroy biological weapons suspend export of
anti-personnel landmines and reduce the forces in border and on non-first use
of nuclear weapons
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#81:1:A>
China has also agreed with neighbors to refrain from staging
military exercises directing against the other and restrictsi restrictions
military exercises as to scale area and the number of such military exercises
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#82:1:A>
Despise <&> should be despite </&> its multilateral peace efforts
China is still feared
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#83:1:A>
Mr President some persist in fanning the fear of a Chinese invasion
and to a certain extent it is indeed worrisome that there exists such a big
army without a declared enemy and moreover construction of structures and
occupation of certain areas without agreements fuel doubts and apprehensions
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#84:1:A>
While fighting off U S rebuke of its human rights record China was
taking in the lessons so magnified in its decision to preserve Hong Kong the
crown jewel of mercantilism at as the port of global trade
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#85:1:A>
China understands the strategic value of not waging a war that will
dissipitate dissipate its resources for it is to construct ports or deploy
troops in overseas bases would detract from its benign deportment that it had
painstakingly sustained through extreme self-restraint
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#86:1:A>
In addition the feared Asian giant is as much threatened by factors
of instability if we can only care to read through its defense strategy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#87:1:A>
With regards to China Mr President I believe that foremost in the U
S priority is its economic potential as when the U S sent its
straight-shooting Albright to join its Trade Secretary to propound America 's
interest
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#88:1:A>
It is one it is but one example that the U S itself took cognizance
that an engagement or any <.> ari </.> any rising rivalry with China would
have to be waged sustained and resolved within economic terms and not in a
fiery war
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#89:1:A>
Now Mr President should we be afraid of China
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#90:1:A>
Today a search for relevant foreign relations initiatives I
reiterate my belief that while conflicts have ceased to be waged on
ideological grounds we need to forge security alliances
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-031#91:1:A>
The new global dynamic is anchored on the protection of national
interests of great powers such as those of Japan China Russia and some other
European states </I>
