<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#1:1:A>
Mr Chairman Mr Chairman <,> Mr Chairman uhm I would like to reiterate
uh the statements uh propounded by the Honorable uh Escudero of Sorsogon and
uh with due reference also to the statements made by the lawyers uh earlier
uh by saying that we would see that the the law <unclear> word </unclear> is
suddenly <unclear> word </unclear> so in that sense the uh support of the
statement of the Honorable uh Congressman from Sorsogon I would read the law

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#2:1:A>
The last paragraph of Section twenty-nine of Republic Act seventy- one
sixty-six Republic Act seven one six six is <quote> an act to provide for the
synchronization of the national and local elections and to provide electoral
reform </quote> that is the title of the law and in Section twenty-nine last
paragraph if I may read <quote> the certificate of canvass prepared by the
Commission Board of Canvassers shall be supported by a statement of votes by
municipality and the original copy of for the Congress shall in addition be
supported by statement of votes by precinct as submitted to the Provincial
Board of Canvassers by city or municipal Board of Canvassers </quote>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#3:1:A>
Very clear in the law that you see a Board of Canvassers is mandated
to place in this ballot box not only the C O C the municipal uh the S O V by
municipality and as well the S O V by precinct

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#4:1:A>
It is mandatory unlike the requirement to submit election returns <?>
on site </?> .

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#5:1:A>
This one is very specific that it should be included here in this
ballot box

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#6:1:A>
And therefore this is in line also for the uh <unclear> word
</unclear> with Section thirty of the law that whenever we discover there are
erasures and there are uh alteration we have to refer to these documents and
when we discover erasures and uh or alterations in an S O V by precinct if it
is not <unclear> words </unclear>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#7:1:A>
So may I may I suggest in the same way as the Honorable Escudero
suggested two days ago that in the meantime we defer this uh ballot uh ballot
box uh uh for uh the province of uh Quirino while we are producing the uh the
S O V

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#8:1:A>
After all this will just be uh reported uh in the same way as we have
summoned the witnesses for the Comelec candidate

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#9:1:A>
Without delaying let us proceed to the other the other ballot boxes

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#10:1:A>
In that way we will be able uh to have an understanding of <unclear>
word </unclear> and not necessarily delay this canvassing Mr Chairman </I>


<I>
<$A>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#11:2:A>
Thank you very much Mr Speaker

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#12:2:A>
Mr Speaker uh I have been wondering why there shall be an adjournment
really uh since uh this has even caused the delay in the in the canvassing

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#13:2:A>
We have already made a headway and suddenly surprisingly uh notice
were sent to us and for purposes of uh adjournment uh as been uh said as
provided in the Constitution

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#14:2:A>
That Mr Speaker I don’t quite agree that we should adjourn
considering the fact that we are also mandated at this instance to do uh the
canvassing

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#15:2:A>
The Constitution does not make any distinction whether we are
functioning as a legislative or as a canvassing

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#16:2:A>
The uh the word uh the House of Representatives is is in session is
<,> to say that there are certain responsibilities there are certain
activities that must be performed by Congress when it is in in session
contrary to when Congress is in recess where members of the House are not
doing its regular work

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#17:2:A>
And canvassing is part of the regular work of Congress being
enshrined in the Constitution

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#18:2:A>
Now this adjournment by the looks alone of the members uh not in
agreement with each other might create a crisis might even uh be raised in
the Supreme Court because we might not be able to proceed Mr Speaker

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#19:2:A>
I ‘m afraid that there must be an or there was a reason why this
adjournment is called and I ‘m afraid that with this the agenda is not to
continue the canvassing and I ‘m afraid that if we don’t continue this
canvassing there will be no proclamation especially Fernando Poe is already
leading

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#20:2:A>
So therefore I am for the <.> continu </.> continuing of the session
and that we will be able to canvass the uh </I>


<I>
<$A>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#21:3:A>
Thank you Mr Speaker

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#22:3:A>
If I may add uh my unsolicited two cents ‘ worth of opinion to this
uh proceeding

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#23:3:A>
Mr Speaker if we do adjourn <foreign> sine die </foreign> this
afternoon we are not adjourning Congress we are adjourning the regular
session of Congress which is provided in Section fifteen of Article six of
the Philippine Constitution

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#24:3:A>
Note Mr Speaker that Section fifteen speaks of Congress convening
once every year on the fourth Monday of July for its regular session unless a
different date is fixed by law and shall continue to be in session that means
in regular session for such number of days as it may determine until thirty
days before the opening of the next regular session

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#25:3:A>
I agree Mr Speaker with the Honorable <.> Flo </.> Majority Leader
that it is not Congress that is adjourned

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#26:3:A>
When we adjourn our regular session we do not terminate the existence
of Congress

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#27:3:A>
After we adjourn our regular session we can be called to a special
session before the termination or the expiration of the term of office of the
members of this House on June thirty

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#28:3:A>
Now when we do meet again in joint public session in order to
proclaim the winning Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidate that joint
public session Mr Speaker I submit is in the nature of a special session

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#29:3:A>
It is in the nature of a special session that need not be called by
the President of the Philippines because Section four of Article seven
specifically calls Congress precisely to that joint public session for the
purpose of canvassing and later proclaiming the President-elect and the
Vice-President-elect

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#30:3:A>
Then there should be no controversy

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#31:3:A>
It is not Mr Speaker that Congress is schizophrenic that it has
multi- personalities even as it does have multi-duties and functions

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#32:3:A>
The matter of legislation is taken up in its regular and special
sessions <,> the matter of canvass is taken up in this joint public session
which uh uh is provided by Section fourteen

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#33:3:A>
True there are <.> man </.> there are different functions of Congress
but this does not at all detract from the fact that Congress must as a
legislative body perform its function and so Mr Speaker I hope that I have
contributed a bit to clarify the matter </I>


<I>
<$A>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#34:4:A>
Thank you Mr Chairman

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#35:4:A>
Mr Chairman to underscore the fact that Congress continues to exist
as a body Congress may be called to a special session by the President of the
Philippines

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#36:4:A>
If it is called to a special session that is recognition that
Congress is still existing all the way up to June thirty

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#37:4:A>
Now is it necessary for the President to call Congress to a special
session in order that it may sit as a national canvassing board

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#38:4:A>
I submit <mention> no </mention> because the Constitution itself in
Section four of Article seven already calls Congress to sit as a special
session

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#39:4:A>
It would be superfluous for us to ask the President of the
Philippines to call Congress to a special session since after all when the
President calls Congress to a special session it is in order that the
Congress may take up legislative matters

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#40:4:A>
In this particular instance we have the Constitution itself calling
Congress to sit as a national canvassing board independently of any call for
a special session by the President

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#41:4:A>
Thank you Mr Chairman </I>


<I>
<$A>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#42:5:A>
Uh Mr <.> Presi </.> Mr Chairman <&> clears throat </&> I think uh we
should distinguish the various rules we have here

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#43:5:A>
There can be no question that both the Congressmen and the Senators
all of us here should remain in office up to June thirty

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#44:5:A>
So up to June thirty we ‘re still Senators we ‘re still Congressmen

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#45:5:A>
Nobody can deprive us of that

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#46:5:A>
So as Senators and Congressmen what will we what are we supposed to
do

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#47:5:A>
Now so much has been uh raised about Section fifteen the rule on
legislative powers which reads that <quote> Congress shall convene once every
year on the fourth Monday of July for its for its regular session unless a
different date is fixed by law </quote> and <foreign> etcetera etcetera
</foreign>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#48:5:A>
What ‘s referred to by Section fifteen is <mention> regular session
</mention>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#49:5:A>
So under our legislative calendar our regular session ended in I
think July uh June June eleven

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#50:5:A>
That is our regular session

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#51:5:A>
So the question is <,> is Congress deprived of other things

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#52:5:A>
My respectful submission Mr Chairman is that <mention> no </mention>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#53:5:A>
If you scan the powers of Congress you will notice that if the
President of the Philippines should declare martial law or suspend the
privilege of the writ of <foreign> habeas corpus </foreign> Congress is
duty-bound within forty-eight hours to meet to approve or disapprove of the
action of the President without need of call in fact

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#54:5:A>
And then whatever Congress does cannot be changed by the President so
that even now if should the President of the Philippines suspend the
privilege of the writ of <foreign> habeas corpus </foreign> or impose martial
law we can meet and approve or disapprove what the President has done

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#55:5:A>
So with that Mr President we have powers continuing powers which
cannot be deprived by even an adjournment of Congress

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#56:5:A>
Adjournment is nothing more than adjournment and as I alluded to
earlier assuming that there was adjournment that adjournment referred to the
regular session

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#57:5:A>
But more directly to the point Mr President Mr Chairman in our role
as canvassers we should look <,,> to Section four on the executive department
which is the canvassing powers

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#58:5:A>
Little noticed is this provision <quote> the person having the
highest number of votes shall be proclaimed elected but in case two or more
shall have an equal and highest number of votes one of them shall forthwith
be chosen by the vote of uh a majority of all members of both Houses of
Congress voting separately </quote>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#59:5:A>
What does this mean Mr Chairman

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#60:5:A>
It means that should in the remote possibility that there is a tie we
are called upon to break the tie as legislators not even as canvassers

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#61:5:A>
Why

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#62:5:A>
Because that is a power a sovereign power vested in us to choose or
break the tie

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#63:5:A>
And the moment we break the tie whoever we favor becomes President of
the Philippines

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#64:5:A>
That is a reserve power so even now should our canvass say that there
‘s a tie we can meet and break the tie

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#65:5:A>
I I ‘ve brought two <.> ins </.> uh uh two instances Mr uh Mr
Chairman <&> clears throat </&> why the <.> Pres </.> why Congress has still
continuing powers to convene even after the adjournment last June eleven
because there are certain powers that we must exercise if the exigencies
arise

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#66:5:A>
That ‘s why Mr <,> Chairman all of this all of this uh debate is not
really to the point because we have still reserve powers which we ‘ll have to
exercise I I so it ‘s my respectful submission Mr Chairman that uh we
continue to have powers we can convene any time up to the end of our terms
because our powers are not diminished one whit up to June thirty

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#67:5:A>
We are not deprived of anything

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#68:5:A>
We only followed the rule of rule uh I mean Section fifteen which
says that thirty days before the end of session we have to uh uh we have to
adjourn but that is refers only to regular session

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#69:5:A>
So Mr Chairman I think we <,> proceed and uh go on on with the
canvass because uh uh I don’t think that the uh uh assertion that uh we have
adjourned uh I think has no uh Constitutional leg to stand on

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#70:5:A>
Thank you Mr Chairman </I>


<I>
<$A>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#71:6:A>
Mr Chairman while I agree with the uh recommendation of Senator
Pimentel that uh following Section fifteen and also following the ruling we
made on the Biliran case that uh those uh missing documents if ever should
should should be produced uh within the day that is provided in our rules

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#72:6:A>
But at the same time strictly speaking uh uh Mr Chairman going by the
standards that uh is are provided for in Section fourteen uh the C O C of
Capiz uh is is authentic and duly executed and the discrepancy noted on the
face of the C O C is not uh the discrepancy that is uh uh described or of <.>
wh </.> in Section fourteen ‘cause in Section fourteen it says no discrepancy
in other authentic copies of uh the certificate of canvass or discrepancy in
the votes of or of any candidate in words and figures in the same certificate

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#73:6:A>
So strictly speaking we did not go through that exercise in the
determination of authenticity and due execution but <indig> ‘yun </indig>
just for the sake of <.> sat </.> satisfying ourselves about this seeming uh
uh inconsistency in the phase we went through that but I don’t think that it
is necessary in the determination of due execution and authenticity

<ICE-PHI:S2A-070#74:6:A>
Therefore Mr Speaker I think it is in order for us to proceed with
the canvass of uh the uh Capiz C O C while at the same time you know uh I as
I said that I agree with the recommendation of uh Senator Pimentel as
provided for in Section fifteen and as we agreed upon in the uh Biliran case
Mr Speaker </I>
