 <$A> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#1:1:A>
The President has just arrived at the <indig> Batasang Pambansa
 </indig> complex
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#2:1:A>
She 's expected to deliver her speech at around four uh this
afternoon
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#3:1:A>
Traditionally, the President as she walks in will take a little time
to speak with members of the House of Representatives the Speaker of the
House uh in the lounge
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#4:1:A>
Usually she goes into the south lounge uh the executive lounge which
is located adjacent to the front area of the Session Hall of the House of
Representatives
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#5:1:A>
There is a doorway leading from <.> thi </.> this lounge going into
the Session Hall
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#6:1:A>
You see the President has just has just entered that lounge and the
doors are going to be closed behind her and her staff
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#7:1:A>
Uh in that in that lounge are members of the House of
Representatives as well as the Senate
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#8:1:A>
The Senate President and the Speaker of the House are expected to
receive the President in that lounge
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#9:1:A>
And uh in a few minutes we could expect the President come out of
the left side of the Senate Session Hall if I I remember my House of
Representatives geography right <&> other anchor laughs </&> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#10:1:A>
She 's expected to exit from the left side the side on our left if
you 're watching with me
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#11:1:A>
Uh and she 's expected to make her way to the podium
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#12:1:A>
Uh behind her are going to be seated the Senate Vice President the
Speaker of the House and the Vice-President I expect and uh she 's going to
deliver her State of the Nation Address
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#13:1:A>
A very short ceremony before that
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#14:1:A>
Uh Malaca&ntilde;ang has been saying that her speech today is going
to be short and simple
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#15:1:A>
Her speech last year was around forty-five or fifty minutes long
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#16:1:A>
Uh in that speech she outlined her thirty-five promises and uh out
of the thirty-five there are some groups that say twenty-two promises were uh
delivered by the President and her administration her cabinet
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#17:1:A>
Uh word the the word is is that the President is going to make new
promises in this new speech uh but focus on very few things uh peace and
order uh being one of them uh power rates is another thing that the President
is going to focus on that probably being the closest to issue to the hearts
of the people at this time
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#18:1:A>
We we 're going to await the entrance of the President into the
Hall
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#19:1:A>
In the meantime we still have Dr Abueva and Prof Romero with us in
the studio <&> break in recording </&> 

 <$B> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#20:1:B>

Jing at this moment uh President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is
still closeted in one of the offices here at the <indig> Batasang Pambansa
 </indig> building with Senate President Franklin Drilon Speaker of the House
Jose Joe de Venecia the Secretary-General of the House
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#21:1:B>

Uh these personalities had met her earlier when she arrived here at
the <indig> Batasan </indig> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#22:1:B>

It is exactly sixteen minutes before the President is uh set to
address the a joint session of Congress
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#23:1:B>

Uh great expectations once again of the President 's SONA and of
the President herself on this her second State of the Nation Address
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#24:1:B>

Uh she will of course by this State of the Nation Address open the
second regular session of the twelfth Congress
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#25:1:B>

The President is now on her way to the uh Session Hall where
Speaker de Venecia and Senate President Drilon are waiting for her waiting to
hear what she has to say
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#26:1:B>

As I said great expectations because as we all know she will be
focusing very strongly and emphasizing very strongly on the need to
strengthen the Republic
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#27:1:B>

She will be talking about a strong Republic that will be the theme
of her SONA this year
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#28:1:B>

This historic <indig> Batasang Pambansa </indig> building has been
witness to a very colorful political history of this country
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#29:1:B>

We all know that uh this was inaugurated in nineteen seventy-eight
uh with the interim <indig> Batasang Pambansa </indig> calling it home
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#30:1:B>

Uh many have said that it was actually a rubber-stamp Parliament uh
by uh of Ferdinand Marcos former President
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#31:1:B>

That Parliament was elected in nineteen seventy-eight
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#32:1:B>

 <{> <[> <,> </[> The interim

 <$A> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#33:1:A>
 <[> Pia </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#34:1:B>

Yes Jing

 <$A> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#35:1:A>
Pia I 'm going to ask you to take off your hat as an as an
anchor and our co-host this afternoon and put on your hat as a subject matter
expert
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#36:1:A>
Uh politically while everyone is excited about what the President
is going to say today and we all know what the reactions are going to be in
the days to come uh but the focus will be on politically what 's happening at
the Senate
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#37:1:A>
Because a lot of things are hinged on that critical numbers game in
the Senate
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#38:1:A>
Now that the majority uh has the numbers what do you expect to
happen uh down the line

 <$B> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#39:1:B>

Well Jing uh we can always say <indig> na </indig> the Senate
uh the administration has the majority now in the Senate
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#40:1:B>

But let 's not forget it 's a very slim majority
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#41:1:B>

Uh it 's thirteen eleven <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#42:1:B>

So <indig> ang lamang lang ng </indig> administration <indig> sa
 </indig> opposition <indig> ay isa lang </indig> <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> so
 <indig> napakaliit na na na linya yan ano </indig> Jing

 <$A> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#43:1:A>
 <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#44:1:A>
 <[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2> 

 <$B> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#45:1:B>

 <&> clapping in the background </&> The President now in the
lobby of the <indig> Batasang Pambansa </indig> building
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#46:1:B>

She 's in a mustard orange uh suit
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#47:1:B>

Beside her is Senator Loren Legarda in a Muslim-inspired attire
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#48:1:B>

A while ago uh the First Gentleman Mike Arroyo was being escorted
into the <indig> Batasang Pambansa </indig> Session Hall by uh Mrs Gina de
Venecia the wife of the Speaker
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#49:1:B>

And with the First Gentleman were the children of the President
Luli Mikey and Dato
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#50:1:B>

Jing as you were saying yes a very slim majority in the Senate
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#51:1:B>

It 's not something exactly to be comfortable about
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#52:1:B>

I suppose that the administration will have to get more Senators on
their side from the opposition
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#53:1:B>

The President uh going down the newly the the Session Hall
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#54:1:B>

As we can see it 's a brand new carpet brand new ceiling brand new
walls and uh the refurbishment has cost the House of Representatives seven
point five million pesos
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#55:1:B>

The President there being greeted by members of the House of
Representatives and of the Senate
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#56:1:B>

They 're going to be sitting in joint session this afternoon as
they listen to her second State of the Nation Address

 <$A> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#57:1:A>
Pia yeah uh let 's not let 's not take the video away from the
screen uh
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#58:1:A>
The President is expected to deliver her Address soon
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#59:1:A>
Let 's just be in the background and provide and provide color
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#60:1:A>
A lot of people have a lot of expectations but a lot of people also
have been saying the same thing about what they expect about the President
peace and order power rates uh jobs uh on top of a whole list of things that
they expect the President to talk about
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#61:1:A>
Have you had more information
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#62:1:A>
You gave us an idea an outline a sense of what the President is
going to talk about
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#63:1:A>
Is there anything any new information about anything that she 's
going to say today
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#64:1:A>
Pia

 <$B> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#65:1:B>

Well Jing uhm you know the problem <indig> kasi </indig> with
uh early releases of the President 's State of the Nation Address is that it
can change at any time
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#66:1:B>

Sometimes <indig> may magbibigay sa inyo ng isang kopya ng isang

<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#72:1:B>

joint Congress of the House of Representatives and the Senate
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#83:1:B>

As I said the President delivered a forty-eight minute speech
applauded seventy-four times
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#84:1:B>

The President declaring war on crime terrorism and poverty a war

<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#85:1:B>

We are the third best-performing economy in Asia the

<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#87:1:B>

She says that a strong Republic is one that will take care of its
people and its future
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#88:1:B>

The President of course beginning her speech by referring to her
father uh the former President Diosdado Macapagal and listing her
accomplishments as regards to the promises that she made in her SONA last
year
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#89:1:B>

Uh there was one thing that stood out in that whole long list of
accomplishments where she said that apart from UNILAB no other medicine
company was giving or selling lower-priced medicines and she said that the
government would be studying punitive measures for in that regard
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#90:1:B>

As soon as she had finished uh her list of accomplishments the
President had said that this is just the tip of the iceberg and that she had
promised that she would deliver and submit to Congress a formalized list of
her accomplishments the booklet that was shown to us last week that was
entitled <mention> G M A Delivered </mention> or <mention> G M A Delivers
 </mention> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#91:1:B>

The President also saying a strong Republic does what it says and
as I said takes care of its people and its future
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#92:1:B>

There was also uh a lot of focus on peace and order the need to uh
combat and defeat crime criminal syndicates and drug syndicates
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#93:1:B>

 <quote> I cannot grow taller but I can always get better </quote> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#95:1:B>

This was of course applauded
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#96:1:B>

She uh in the meantime was saying that in the future her working
agenda was to create more job opportunities and of course to intensify the
fight against corruption to maintain peace and order and to bring down the
cost of power
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#97:1:B>

She did say that she had ordered that the P P A be lowered be
decreased and uh she 's taking credit for that
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#98:1:B>

Of course also a a reminder to NAPOCOR and MERALCO to stop
bickering to work together
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#99:1:B>

Also the President making one of her more memorable statements
 <mention> the stone of a strong Republic </mention> when and she also said
 <quote> and I intend to be well-remembered </quote> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#100:1:B>

disappoint those who went to EDSA </quote> 
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#101:1:B>

Also I suppose uh she was referring to these civil society groups
that had uh just recently just about two or three weeks ago been very upset
about the appointments or the joining the administration by the Puno <.> bro
 </.> by Ronnie Ronaldo Puno and by Jaime Policarpio the President was saying
that she uh regrets that there were broken friendships along the way
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#102:1:B>

She did also say and end her speech her her State of the Nation
Address by saying many of the right decisions are the tough decisions but she
did promise that she will lead our country towards a strong Republic
 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-005S2A-005ICE-PHI:S2A-005#103:1:B>
