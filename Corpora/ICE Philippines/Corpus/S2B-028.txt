<&> beginning of the speaker 's speech was delivered in
Filipino </&> Beloved countrymen and countrywomen our dear friends <,> this
commemoration carries greater significance than those of earlier years and
over the next three hundred sixty-five days we shall focus our attention on
preparing for the celebration of our first centennial of independence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#2:1:A>
Our choice of the theme for this year 's commemoration is most
fitting <indig> Diwang Pilipino Isaisip Isapuso Isagawa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#3:1:A>
For truly this is the time when we Filipinos in thought in heart and
in action must relive the national spirit that made us free <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#4:1:A>
Let us all <?> take encouragement </?> as we embark on this
year-long undertaking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#5:1:A>
Our nation is secure our nation is stable and our nation is
competitive <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#6:1:A>
For five long years we have given our best to the challenges before
us in order this time for our hearts and minds our <unclear> 1 word
 </unclear> and energies have been collectively directed toward the singular
objective of raising our nation from the pits of crises and stagnation to the
threshold of sustained progress
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#7:1:A>
And we have not been denied
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#8:1:A>
Our country is at peace not only with other nations but within our
own national community which once was fragmented by rebellion and insurgency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#9:1:A>
Our democracy is stable with our Constitution fully reigning over
our national life and our democratic institutions fully functioning <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#10:1:A>
Our social reforms to guarantee the the delivery of our people 's
basic needs are being implemented and our economy is growing achieving a
level of productivity unprecedented in our history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#11:1:A>
In all our recent labors and struggles one thing above all has
stood out and that is the fact that working together and with democracy as
our standard we Filipinos can move our nation forward <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#12:1:A>
We will not be where we are today but for the faith and spirit that
since June twelve eighteen ninety-eight has fortified us in trials and crises
that sometimes seem overwhelming
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#13:1:A>
That faith and spirit first found its voice in Dr Jose Rizal who
gave his life on these grounds for believing that Filipinos could be a nation
in their own right
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#14:1:A>
That faith or spirit was forged on the anvil of revolution by
Andres Bonifacio whose centennial we mark this year and that faith and spirit
proclaimed itself to the world in Kawit Cavite ninety-nine years ago when
President Emilio Aguinaldo raised the flag of our republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#15:1:A>
Around these great events and personages at the turn of the
nineteenth century the story of our people before and since has always turned
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#16:1:A>
Our independence proclamation in eighteen ninety-eight crowned our
people 's unceasing struggle since the time of Lapu-Lapu and Soliman to be
free and sovereign in our own land and it claimed for all Filipino
generations since the challenge of building recovering defending and
strengthening the Filipino nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#17:1:A>
In the web of history all our struggles aspirations and
achievements as a people come together and they lay claim to our memories as
we prepare to mark our first centennial as a republic and approach a new
century of challenge
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#18:1:A>
Let us therefore gather our energies together to ensure the
successful commemoration of our first centennial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#19:1:A>
It demands the collective participation of all our people every
group every sector every community every creed every family and every citizen
who constitute our nation </I>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#20:2:A>
Thank you Mr President
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#21:2:A>
Mr President distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the Senate my
countrymen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#22:2:A>
Mr President uh almost eight years ago I stood before this august
chamber armed with all the courage and fervor I could summon and boldly
shouted <mention> no </mention> a thousand <mention> no </mention> to the
extension of the United States military bases in the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#23:2:A>
The crucial issue at that time was whether to terminate the
presence of American military basing facilities in the country or not
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#24:2:A>
Today Mr President once again we are confronted with yet another
vital issue of similar import and that is whether or not the Senate should
give its concurrence to the Visiting Forces Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#25:2:A>
And this time Mr President I rise in this great and important forum
of our people to proclaim before the entire nation <mention> yes </mention> a
thousand <mention> yes </mention> to the Visiting Forces Agreement between
our country and the United States of America
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#26:2:A>
Mr President I realize the seeming contradiction between my
position now and my position then
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#27:2:A>
In nineteen ninety-one out of personal conviction I completely
aligned myself with those who opposed the extension of American military
presence in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#28:2:A>
I was totally convinced and committed to vote against it as I
finally did
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#29:2:A>
And I gave you my assurance Mr President that if any attempt should
be made to revive the presence of foreign military bases in the country I
would be the first to firmly stand again amongst those who would oppose such
a venture with the same passion and conviction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#30:2:A>
Today however I 've aligned myself with those who are supporting
the approval of the Visiting Forces Agreement which will in effect allow
again the entry of American troops in the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#31:2:A>
And like before I am as equally convinced and committed to vote in
favor of our concurrence as I do now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#32:2:A>
Because of this Mr President I deem it my duty to give a candid
explanation to our people who gave me the mandate the honor and the privilege
to serve them in this chamber
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#33:2:A>
I owe it to them most especially and to history as well to <.> re
 </.> render a clear and faithful account of why I have taken such seemingly
diametrically opposing positions on so important and critical national issues
of our time as the total removal of American forces from the Philippines on
the one hand and our concurrence to the on the Visiting Forces Agreement on
the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#34:2:A>
But let me digress briefly at this juncture Mr President and relate
to you the general impression I gathered during several hearings and
deliberations on the mis measure under consideration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#35:2:A>
Although our proceedings were conducted under an atmosphere of
guarded civility the discussions were in many instances marred by some degree
of asperity and animosity
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#36:2:A>
There were if you will still recall angry diatribes and outbursts
in and out of the areas where we held our hearings
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#37:2:A>
Even our recent debates in this hall were not spared
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#38:2:A>
In addition the arguments of those who appeared to offer their
opposition and pardon me for saying this were boringly and tiresomely
repetitious and highly emotional and if I may add garnished with a generous
proportion of bias and prejudice
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#39:2:A>
What struck me most as significant however Mr President was the
sectoral composition and arguments of those who appear to oppose the Visiting
Forces Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#40:2:A>
They were in many respects identical to the sectoral composition
and arguments of those who previously stood against the extension of the
United States military bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#41:2:A>
In fact I got the impression that there was hardly anything new
that was added under the sun
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#42:2:A>
It was to me no more than a <foreign> deja vu </foreign> of
nineteen ninety-one the same banners the same streamers the same propaganda
tactics the same stereotyped speeches the same anti-American slogans the same
anti-imperialism <unclear> 1 word </unclear> the same invectives the same
clenched fists were all too evident to be seen and heard
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#43:2:A>
And so since the similarity of the opposition in both cases was
quite obvious Mr President I deemed it worthless to further dwell on that and
so I will therefore simply confine my narration to the arguments presented by
the two sides of the debate in nineteen ninety-one to show how closely alike
they were to the arguments now being heard in connection with the Visiting
Forces Agreement
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#44:2:A>
You will recall Mr President that the anti-American bases groups
argued then that never again should foreign military bases troops or
facilities be allowed in our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#45:2:A>
That our national sovereignty and self-respect required no less
than the total dismantling and removal of all vestiges of our colonial past
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#46:2:A>
That the existence in our land of American military bases and their
component troops and facilities would unnecessarily involve us in
international conflicts that were not of our own making or liking
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#47:2:A>
That such military bases troops and facilities were really not
meant to promote our national security but were intended instead to advance
the defense strategy and economic power of the United States of America
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#48:2:A>
And that they would serve more as a potent magnet for offensive
military action that would endanger the safety of our country and possibly
expose our people to a very grave risk if not actual disaster and ruin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#49:2:A>
And that instead of casting aside the historic opportunity
presented to us at that time to be truly independent and self-reliant
Republic we should seize and use it to attain our complete freedom so that we
could shape our own future and chart our own foreign policy unencumbered by
any demeaning burden on our dignity and honor as a nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#50:2:A>
You will also recall Mr President on the other hand that the
advocates of continued American military presence in the in our country
especially in Clark and Subic insisted that American military bases troops
and facilities were good for our country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#51:2:A>
That we really needed them for our defense and security
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#52:2:A>
That their presence would enhance the prestige of our country and
would moreover preserve and provide jobs for our countrymen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#53:2:A>
That they would assure the rapid development and improvement of our
military capability
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#54:2:A>
That they would effectively maintain the balance of power in the
Southeast Asian region
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#55:2:A>
And that they would serve as a strong and dependable deterrent
against any predatory nation that might have any ill-conceived design to harm
us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#56:2:A>
You will perhaps recall remember too Mr President that in nineteen
ninety-one I was the lone fiscalizer in the Senate against the administration
of then President Corazon C Aquino and at the same time the Minority Floor
Leader of this chamber
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#57:2:A>
And because of my unique role then as the only remaining elected
opposition Senator of the Republic and because especially of my intimate
knowledge and assessment of our national condition at that time I
unconditionally and without any hesitation supported the total removal of all
American bases from the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#58:2:A>
I also fully concurred with the anti-American bases groups then
that those military bases established in nineteen forty-seven initially and
primarily to serve the United <w> States' </w> interests and to project her
military power abroad
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#59:2:A>
They were not at all intended for or involved in the security of
the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#60:2:A>
In fact the United States according to the common understanding at
that time had no obligation whatsoever under the Military Bases Agreement to
defend us against any foreign military invader except when her own military
bases were themselves the object of attack
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#61:2:A>
It was only later on that those military bases were somehow linked
to our national security because of the Mutual Defense Treaty concluded in
nineteen fifty-one which forged and established our defense alliance with the
United States of America
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#62:2:A>
And those military bases were conveniently used by the United
States in fulfilling her obligation to us under the Mutual Defense Treaty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#63:2:A>
In legal <?> norm </?> therefore those military bases had nothing
to do in creating the military alliance between the two countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#64:2:A>
Today Mr President in voting as I do now in favor of our
concurrence to the Visiting Forces Agreement I am more persuaded and impelled
now than I was in nineteen ninety-one by the same consideration of national
security for the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#65:2:A>
Perhaps because of my <.> pol </.> because my political role has
changed from what it had been in nineteen ninety-one since I 'm now a member
of the ruling coalition in this chamber there is reason to think that I will
simply follow the dictates of the ruling majority and vote in favor of our
concurrence for no other consideration and reason than pure political
expediency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#66:2:A>
Mr President that I will never do
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#67:2:A>
If I were to simply vote in favor of this important measure on the
basis of a mere of mere political alignment that to me would be tantamount to
a betrayal of my sworn obligation as an elected Senator of the Republic
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#68:2:A>
Having been one of the so-called <mention> Magnificent Twelve
 </mention> that voted in nineteen ninety-one for the removal of American
military bases I cannot and will not just disregard or sweep aside the
collective best interests of this nation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#69:2:A>
Neither will I allow myself Mr President to be swayed by the almost
irresistible appeal of esteemed friends and professional colleagues nor to be
intimidated frightened or pressured by the strident clamor the blandishment
and arrogant threats of noisy boisterous groups that stand opposed to the
Visiting Forces Agreement no matter how popular their position or how serious
their threats may be without carefully scrutinizing the material and relevant
national interest involved
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#70:2:A>
Of course Mr President as a human being if I were principally moved
by a purely selfish motive if I were only concerned with my own political
interest or personal well-being that would have been the most <?> facile </?> 
the most logical the most rewarding and the safest course of action for me to
have taken
 
<ICE-PHI:S2B-028#71:2:A>
But then again had I done that had I acted otherwise than to
determine carefully for myself the most sensible and advantageous course of
action the country should follow in the wake of her present circumstance it
would have been a faithless discharge of my duty as a Senator </I>
