<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#4:1>
Science and technology ( S&T) for economic growth is the
government 's rallying theme in its turn-of-the-century vision of achieving a
newly industrialized country ( NIC) status in next decade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#5:1>
Amid the current hoopla over a visibly resurgent economy, the
government, in the long term, is counting on its S&T development capabilities
to finally shrug off the country 's economic <foreign> pariah </foreign> tag
in the Asian tiger neighborhood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#6:1>
The catching up game might have taken the form of a baby leapfrog,
but the impressive growth performance is facing imminent threats and
challenges following the country 's accession to the 120-member World Trade
Organization ( WTO). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#7:1>
A WTO membership means freer exchange of goods and services among
member countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#8:1>
Global trends also indicate a steady shift to knowledge-intensive
wealth creation and trade activities that demand competitiveness and force
high value-added innovations in technology industries such as electronics,
computer hardware and software, communications, materials science and
biotechnology. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#9:1>
This indicates that the Philippines is marching into a fiercely
competitive 21st century trade environment with a very short four-year gap
into the vision of industrialization for the country by the year 2000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#10:1>
Without an aggressive S&T build-up, the country could find itself
again an insignificant bystander in the opulent WTO grab bag. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#11:1>
After missing the NIC train in the ' 70s and having wrestled with
the political turbulence of the ' 80s, the government is pinning its future
to the Department of Science and Technology ( DOST) to jump-start its S&T
development master plan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#12:1>
The objective is to catch up with the more progressive Asian
economies including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#13:1>
But S&T in the Philippines is an erratic affair despite a
reputation as the show window of western influence in Asia.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#14:1>
To begin with, there was never an S&T blueprint for the country until
the 10-year S&T Master Plan ( STMP) was instituted in 1990 under the Aquino
administration. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#15:1>
<h> <bold> STRATEGIES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#16:1>
Under the STMP, the DOST-led development strategies are:

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#17:1>
*modernization of the production sector through massive technology
transfer from local and foreign sources;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#18:1>
*upgrading of research and development ( R&D) capability through
intensified activities in high-priority areas, and

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#19:1>
*development of S&T infrastructure including institution and manpower
build-up and promotion of S&T culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#20:1>
In less than three years, the Ramos administration further
defined the STMP by <quote> &ldquo; refocusing efforts on the leading edges
&rdquo; </quote> identified earlier. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#21:1>
During the first multisectoral forum on S&T held in January 1993,
Pres. Ramos pushed for the Science and Technology Agenda for National
Development ( STAND). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#22:1>
It is aimed at <quote> &ldquo; teaching Filipinos to use
technology to enhance our skills and optimize productivity to give us greater
access to and control of our resources in people and nature. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#23:1>
STAND 's primary goals are to modernize agriculture and achieve full
industrialization of this sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#24:1>
Under the six-year STAND, the government expects to raise export
level to &dollar;30 billion, achieve a per capita income of &dollar;1,000,
and reduce poverty incidence to 30% or lower. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#25:1>
Latest statistics from the National Economic and Development
Administration, however, show the per capita income level last year was
&dollar;1,090, breaching the &dollar;1,000 target three years ahead of
schedule.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#26:1>
It was impressive enough considering the figure was only &dollar;630
in 1988. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#27:1>
<h> <bold> ELECTRONICS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#28:1>
Government data also show that the country shipped out some
&dollar;705 billion worth of electronic products which is nearly 50% of the
country 's 1995 export receipts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#29:1>
The STAND formula hinges on tapping private sector participation,
use of emerging technologies ( microelectronics, laser, biotechnology,
materials science and information technology), manpower build-up,
S&T-friendly policies, networking with other line departments,
non-governmental organizations and private institutions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#30:1>
By linking with the mainstream industries and <foreign> academia
</foreign> , STAND hopes to spur a hotbed of technological activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#31:1>
The local electronic industry, although thriving, is largely
dominated by foreign electronic giants which build assembly plants here to
avail of generous investment incentives and quality and affordable labor.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#32:1>
Science and Technology Secretary William Padolina said <quote>
&ldquo; achieving global competitiveness and NIC status means a bid to
increase production of world-class elaborately manufactured goods and to
provide world-class services. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#33:1>
He further added that this <quote> &ldquo; translates to having
the policy and regulatory environment, human capability, and physical
infrastructure to enable us to deliver such goods and services at the right
price, quality and time. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#34:1>
The capability to add value to goods and services is now the
basis for competitiveness.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#35:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It is now clear that economic development is not
achieved by increased infusion of labor and capital income alone but by
improving efficiency and productivity, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Padolina added.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#36:1>
Mr. Padolina suggested the government should lead a shift to what
Alvin Toffler ( of <mention> <it> Future Shock </it> </mention> fame) calls
<mention> &ldquo; third wave, &rdquo; </mention> or knowledge-based economic
development approach. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#37:1>
Under a <mention> &ldquo; third wave &rdquo; model </mention> ,
labor and capital are no longer the sole basis of an economy 's comparative
advantage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#38:1>
It now includes the stockpile of knowledge and information
enhanced by a combination of timely intervention and state policies <quote>
&ldquo; whose positive effects have accumulated over time. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#39:1>
The &ldquo; third wave &rdquo; revolution, in effect, sets the
Philippines on a drastically altered internal and external conditions
compared to those experienced by the neighboring NICs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#40:1>
Unlike in the ' 50s, the Philippines today cannot pin its hope on
an economic miracle from a basically agro-industrial development initiative.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#41:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It can't be the Taiwan or the South Korea model.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#42:1>
It has to be a special plan considering RP peculiarities, &rdquo;
</quote> Mr. Padolina pointed out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#43:1>
Mr. Padolina believes the country 's <quote> &ldquo; niche right
now is in computer software development, design and production. &rdquo;
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#44:1>
Current UN estimates put the global software market at a staggering
&dollar;200 billion while the Philippines ' current participation is placed
within the &dollar;60-&dollar;70 million range. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#45:1>
But Mr. Padolina said the long walk to the multibillion-dollar
software market can start off by developing a local customized software
industry catering mainly to education, including software for teaching
improvement, which is a <quote> &ldquo; very, very large market &rdquo;
</quote> considering the country 's million student population. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#46:1>
On the other hand, <quote> &ldquo; we continue to be
technologically strong in agriculture.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#47:1>
It 's just that when it comes to implementation, the equation is
incomplete and compounded by a tough environment that is biased against
agriculture, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Padolina observed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#48:1>
Such an equation imbalance can be solved in part by <quote>
&ldquo; connecting the agriculture sector to the process industry which
really adds value to our relatively unprocessed agriculture products, &rdquo;
</quote> he added. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#49:1>
<h> <bold> MANPOWER </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#50:1>
S&T authorities believe the Philippines can indeed attain global
competitiveness because of several factors.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#51:1>
A Hong Kong-based consultancy group in a 1994 study ranked the
country first in Asia in terms of available educated, English-proficient
manpower. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#52:1>
Labor cost here is also competitive by Association of Southeast
Asia Nations ( ASEAN) standards.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#53:1>
Workers in electronics manufacturing for instance get an average
monthly pay of less than &peso;4,000 ( &dollar;140) while engineers receive
around &peso;15,000 ( &dollar;600). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#54:1>
But overall, the problem with the country 's S&T development
program remains the low capital outlay in Pesos, which in 1995 stood at only
0.19% of the gross national product ( GNP), with 85% of this still
government-funded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#55:1>
Brain drain is also a big problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#56:1>
Local scientists and highly trained technical manpower have either
migrated to the more prosperous countries or are serving foreign projects
overseas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#57:1>
The Philippines also ranked a distant 35th of the 48 nations in
terms of &ldquo; third wave &rdquo; capabilities surveyed by the World
Economic Forum, the lowest in ASEAN. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#58:1>
A reality check dictates the Philippines should invest at least
1% of its GNP to R&D activities based on United Nations standards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#59:1>
A more liberal incentives scheme for private R&D activities, such
as special tax and low-interest loan packages and technology
commercialization assistance can help slow down the brain drain syndrome.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#60:1>
<quote> &ldquo; In the past, S&T had been marginalized and the
cumulative effects of such neglect are now felt.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#61:1>
But these are not insurmountable because creative S&T-based solutions
and policy reforms can provide the needed help, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Padolina
said. </p> </I>

<h> <it> ( Third of three parts) </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#65:2>
Isaac Bashevis Singer, 1978 Nobel Prize winner for literature, in
one of his memorable essays wrote, <quote> &ldquo; If ever our situation is
going to be improved, no novel will do it, and no poetry and no story. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#X66:2>
It will be done by scientists, by technology, maybe by some good
politicians. &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#67:2>
In the Philippines ' science and technology ( S&T) development
experience, it appears more of the good politicians are necessary to strike a
healthy balance to achieve the desired improvement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#68:2>
S&T, as integral basis of national economic development, became
part of the official state policy framework only under the 1987 Constitution.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#69:2>
This led to the creation of the Department of Science and
Technology ( DOST) through Executive Order 128 issued by former President
Aquino on January 30, 1987. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#70:2>
The DOST is tasked to &ldquo; energize &rdquo; research and
development ( R&D) using current local, indigenous technologies and absorb
foreign technologies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#71:2>
At the same time, the country 's S&T manpower base is being
expanded mainly through the 1994 science scholarship law which aims at
producing some 3,500 science scholars annually. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#72:2>
The government also hopes to add another 1,600 highly trained
scientists, engineers and science teachers from 101 high schools, 19
engineering schools and 10 colleges with an &dollar;85-million loan support
from the World Bank and Japan 's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#73:2>
A combination of global technology search program and S&T
advisory councils ( STACs) organized by the Department of Foreign Affairs in
key cities abroad is also being pursued.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#74:2>
The STACs are manned by Filipino scientists and engineers to monitor
international S&T developments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#75:2>
Twenty foreign-based Filipino experts have returned to the
country under the <indig> Balik </indig> - Scientist program since its
revival in 1994.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#76:2>
The program provides incentives to attract migrant scientists who
want to work and share their expertise with the local science community. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#77:2>
In brief, the DOST wants to link R&D to industries while creating
a &ldquo; critical mass &rdquo; of S&T personnel.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#78:2>
This was started aggressively since 1990 <quote> &ldquo; to enable
the Philippines to attain the status of a newly industrializing country by
the year 2000. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#79:2>
But just how serious the government 's industrialization program
is plainly explained by the money muscle DOST is given for the last six
years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#80:2>
DOST 's 1996 budget of &peso;3.395 billion is a distant 13th
place among 19 departments, although a budgetary leap is likely to happen
next year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#81:2>
The average annual DOST budget from 1991 to 1996 is only about
&peso;2.4 billion.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#82:2>
But just as a point of comparison, this is even less than a
single-year R&D expenditure of American computer software giant Microsoft
which spent nearly &dollar;100 million in 1993 alone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#83:2>
However, if next year 's allocation is included, it will
translate to a tidy 37% annual increase since 1991. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#84:2>
On top of this and in spite of generous tax incentives allowed
under Executive Order 226 issued during the previous administration, Board of
Investments records show that for the eight-year period covering July
1987-July 1995, private sector R&D investments amounted only to &peso;594
million, or roughly &peso;74 million annual average. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#85:2>
The DOST study revealed the government undertakes as much as 85%
of all R&D programs in the country as of last year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#86:2>
Meanwhile, as early as 1993, the share of R&D expenditures in
Gross Domestic Product ( GDP) in the Philippines was so low ( 0.21%) compared
to South Korea ( 2.23%), Singapore ( 1.12%). Malaysia ( 0.37%) and Indonesia
( 0.26%). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#87:2>
DOST Secretary William Padolina said, <quote> &ldquo; the science
community in the Philippines today consists of 15,910 scientists, engineers,
technicians and auxiliary personnel involved in R&D &rdquo; </quote>
projects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#88:2>
Located in 449 identified institutions, the bulk of the S&T
community is in government, or 12,144 ( 76%) while 3,766 ( 24%) are in the
private sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#89:2>
But if the Philippines is to industrialize, the size of the
science community must expand to at least 29,640 or 380 per one million
Filipinos compared to only 155 in 1992, a study of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shows. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#90:2>
These shall be composed of 6,909 postgraduates, 1,380 masteral
and 3,447 college degree holders with R&D specialization and another 6,892
college graduates in science and mathematics on top of 10,338 technical
courses-trained personnel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#91:2>
Mr. Padolina noted that there 's a <quote> &ldquo; shortage of
scientists in the fundamental disciplines of chemistry, physics, and
mathematics but a relatively large pool for biology. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#92:2>
The country 's engineering education system which produces an
estimated 30,000 each year also needs a thorough review because the skills
produced <quote> &ldquo; are not responsive to industry requirements
especially in engineering design, &rdquo; </quote> Mr. Padolina added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#93:2>
Notwithstanding the many constraints, <quote> &ldquo; the DOST
system has developed technical competence in the fields of biotechnology,
meteorology, medical and marine sciences, geothermal energy, volcanology,
plant breeding, coconut production and utilization. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#94:2>
Except for notable research advances made in biodegradable
plastics and thin-film rechargeable batteries which are potential sources of
megabucks when finally commercialized, most of technologies developed by DOST
are predominantly in agriculture, forest products and aqua culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#95:2>
In a technology-based international trade set up, even the most
sophisticated pest-resistant fruits, embryo-cultured <indig> <it> macapuno
</it> </indig> and sex-reversed <indig> tilapia </indig> are no match to
simple electronic telecommunications equipment computer parts and software.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#96:2>
A cursory list of the Philippines ' &ldquo; export winners
&rdquo; continue to be garments, fashion accessories, assembled electronic
products, computer software, toys, gifts, house ware, fresh and processed
fruits, shrimp, tuna, sea weeds, furniture, marble products and ornamental
plants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#97:2>
The Philippines, meanwhile, continues to pump out dollars for
imported power generation machineries, telecommunication and transport
equipment, chemicals, fuel, lubricants and synthetic textile yarns - - all
produced by industrialized trade partners, a DOST study shows. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-034#98:2>
Again, with the exception of the crude <indig> jeepney </indig> ,
there is hardly any other steel-plastic-rubber Filipino S&T creation as
widely and productively used everyday in an economy composed of more than 65
million people or roughly 11 million households. </p> </I>
