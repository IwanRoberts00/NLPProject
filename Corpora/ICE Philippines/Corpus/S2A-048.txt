<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#1:1:A>
Good afternoon to everybody <,> my students and friends <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#2:1:A>
Uh allow me to use this microphone because I 'll be reading some notes and be going to the overhead projector to show you some slides <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#3:1:A>
So first of all I 'd like to uh correct that I am a doctor a specialist <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#4:1:A>
So right now the highest educational attainment I got is uh an M S in Environmental Engineering and also a I 'm a <.> Bachelo </.> Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering graduate not a B S Chemistry graduate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#5:1:A>
I 'd like to thank the organizer of this symposium uh which is <indig> LIKAS </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#6:1:A>
Uh for those who are not familiar this is the <indig> Lasalista para sa Pag-iingat ng Kalikasan </indig> uh and I 'm very happy that uh they have organized the Ecology Week to make us aware of uh our role and our responsibility as protector of the environment
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#8:1:A>
So I was asked to present a paper or a lecture about air pollution in the urban scene
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#9:1:A>
And fortunately when I was given notice about it in the the last week of October I was already preparing a paper for next week uh International Conference on Environmental Protection in Big ASEAN cities
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#10:1:A>
And uh <.> wha </.> the paper that I will be presenting is a paper entitled Air Pollution Study in Metro Manila
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#11:1:A>
So it was just very timely that I have the paper uh being prepared so I consented on giving this uh lecture to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#12:1:A>
So some of the data and notes that I 'll be presenting next week will already be given to you in advance
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#13:1:A>
Okay <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#14:1:A>
So uhm <,> so the topic I prepared for you this afternoon is air pollution-related problems in the urban areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#15:1:A>
There are a lot of pollution problems we 're experiencing right now but uh the one tasked of me to present to you is on air pollution because there are many forms of environmental degradation <indig> 'no </indig> and one form is uh air pollution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#16:1:A>
But specifically we 'll be talking about air pollution in the urban scene
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#17:1:A>
Uh there are so many problems that arise through air pollution like photochemical smog and right now we are experiencing global climatic changes the greenhouse effect which the adviser of ENGLICOM already mentioned okay and some other uh related problems will be discussed here 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#> And maybe at the end we can present some solutions and your suggestion will be highly appreciated later on because in next week 's uh international conference there will also be a workshop where maybe some of the suggestions that you will be handing on or recommending today will be incorporated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#18:1:A>
Okay <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#19:1:A>
Now what is air pollution and what are its effects
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#20:1:A>
First the National Pollution Control Commission now called the Environment Management Bureau under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources or D E N R defines air pollution as an undesirable change in the physical chemical and or biological characteristics of air which will adversely affect plants animals human beings and even inanimate materials
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#21:1:A>
Now what is air pollutant
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#22:1:A>
It 's also called air contaminant and it is defined as any substance not normally present in air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#23:1:A>
So it 's not normally present in air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#24:1:A>
There are a lot of gases which we will show later normally present in air or it is also defined as these substances measured maybe present in normally in air but their concentration is greater than their normal concentration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#25:1:A>
So they 're also considered a pollutant okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#26:1:A>
Let us take for example carbon dioxide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#27:1:A>
Carbon dioxide is normally present in air in a certain normal quantity but right now it has been shown from researches or findings and is already documented that carbon dioxide is increasing at a rate of uh about one to three percent a year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#28:1:A>
And so therefore uh we are already experiencing global climate changes or global warming due to it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#29:1:A>
So we now consider it carbon dioxide as a pollutant because it is now present in the atmosphere greater than its normal concentration
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#30:1:A>
Now what are the normal substances present in air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#31:1:A>
If we look at table one on a dry basis the composition of clean air is shown
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#32:1:A>
Is that very clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#33:1:A>
By expressed in percent by volume we have the second column and in terms of parts per million we have the third column
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#34:1:A>
So these are the normal composition of clean air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#35:1:A>
It 's on a dry basis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#36:1:A>
Thirty percent of the weight of air is water vapor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#37:1:A>
But this is on a dry basis
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#38:1:A>
So let 's take for example carbon dioxide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#39:1:A>
It is normally present at three hundred eighteen P P M
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#40:1:A>
But if you exceed that right now it 's about three hundred seventy-five P P M okay it 's already above what is normally present then carbon dioxide in excess is already an air pollutant okay <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#42:1:A>
There are different classifications of air pollutants
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#43:1:A>
And later on you will find out that among these there are five major pollutants identified to be ever increasing in an urban area okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#44:1:A>
And these are carbon monoxide the hydrocarbons the nitrogen oxides the particular matter and sulfur dioxide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#45:1:A>
But table two will show you the different classifications of air pollutants
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#46:1:A>
So air pollutant may be classified as inorganic gases organic gases and particulates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#47:1:A>
Under the inorganic gases we have the oxide of nitrogen okay and we have typical examples of this pollutant in air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#49:1:A>
Also under inorganic we have oxide of sulfur
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#50:1:A>
We have sulfur dioxide sulfur trioxide oxide of carbon and other inorganics like hydrogen sulfide hydrogen chloride ammonia and chlorine are also considered to be inorganic gases that are uh considered as pollutants
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#52:1:A>
Under the main classification of organic gas we have the different hydrocarbons
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#53:1:A>
Okay we have methane butane etcetera
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#54:1:A>
We have the aldihydes and the other organics
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#55:1:A>
And last classification fall under particulate matter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#56:1:A>
We have solid particulates in air and we have also liquid particulates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#57:1:A>
A best example of a solid particulate is lead
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#58:1:A>
This is one of the related problem right now is the lead accumulation in air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#59:1:A>
We will be discussing that in detail later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#60:1:A>
There 's also smoke which comes from the tailpipes of our cars considered to be solid particulates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#61:1:A>
And then of course we have the liquid particulates like the acids suspended in air and of course mist spray etcetera
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#62:1:A>
So among all these pollutants present in air <,> I mentioned five major uh pollutants that are of concern for us in the urban areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#63:1:A>
We have sulfur dioxide <,> nitrogen oxide <,> <.> inor </.> uh rather uh carbon monoxide hydrocarbons and particulate matter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#64:1:A>
Now since these are ever increasing in the urban area what are its effect on us on animals plants and inanimate objects <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#65:1:A>
Carbon monoxide is derived in urban areas from automobile
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#66:1:A>
Transportation may account to over ninety percent by weight of all carbon monoxide in the air in large cities especially if retail heavy industry is present
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#67:1:A>
So we obtain or carbon monoxide in air comes from mostly or mainly from transportation okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#68:1:A>
Carbon monoxide has a bad effect on health
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#69:1:A>
It passes through the lungs directly into the blood stream
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#70:1:A>
It has a toxic effect caused by the affinity of the hemoglobin in the blood for C O molecule
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#71:1:A>
What 's the function of hemoglobin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#72:1:A>
Hemoglobin functions to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#73:1:A>
So it provides the oxygen <,> to the from the lungs to the body tissue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#74:1:A>
Since carbon monoxide combines with the hemoglobin strongly it prevents the carrying of oxygen to the tissues
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#75:1:A>
So it is easy therefore to understand why in heavy traffic or congested traffic we experience headaches and dizziness okay especially if our cars are not air-conditioned okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#77:1:A>
Maybe some of you have air-conditioned cars you may not experience this kind of uh symptoms
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#78:1:A>
Sulfur oxides are primarily sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#79:1:A>
They are derived mostly from stationary sources like power plants and industries by the burning of fossil fuels
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#80:1:A>
Sulfur oxide in the atmosphere produce deleterious effect on vegetation materials and man
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#81:1:A>
Leaves of affected plants show <?> splotted </?> bleaching pattern
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#82:1:A>
So the leaves of uh trees and plants changes color
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#83:1:A>
It 's being bleached by the presence of sulfur dioxide in the air <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#84:1:A>
Also sulfur dioxide dissolves to form sulfuric sulfurous acid
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#85:1:A>
Sulfur trioxide dissolves to form sulfuric acid
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#86:1:A>
You are familiar with these strong acids
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#87:1:A>
These suspended acids these are the liquid particulates they are suspended in air are washed down during the first rain when it rains they 're washed down
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#88:1:A>
So what will happen
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#89:1:A>
It causes damage okay damages to what
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#90:1:A>
To properties like metals vegetation and textiles because nylon and other fabrics are easily attacked by these acids
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#92:1:A>
These are called acid rains
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#93:1:A>
That 's one of the related problem we will also be discussing at the end
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#94:1:A>
Acid rains can corrode metals attack nylon and other fabrics
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#95:1:A>
It affects also plants
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#96:1:A>
Even limestone and marble are susceptible to acid attack
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#97:1:A>
So don't say that uh marble or limestone cannot be corroded okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#98:1:A>
They are <.> degra </.> degraded okay because of the reaction of these material with acid rains
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#99:1:A>
Sulfur dioxide acts an irritant and is known to increase symptoms of patients with bronchitis and other lung diseases
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#100:1:A>
Hydrocarbons are mostly derived from incomplete combustion or partial oxidation of fuel in motor vehicle found in the urban areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#101:1:A>
So if our engine like what Ms Chua mentioned in her introduction if we don't tune up our engine so uh oxidation in our engine of the or burning of fuel inside our engine becomes incomplete or partial
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#102:1:A>
So if you burn C H C X H Y with oxygen some of C X H Y remain unreacted 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#103:1:A>
So not not all are converted to C O two or C O plus water but some are unreacted C X H Y
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#104:1:A>
So this is one of the source of uh hydrocarbon in air the incomplete combustion due to <.> ma </.> maybe improper air to fuel ratio tuning or timing of our engine
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#105:1:A>
Forest and vegetation also emit various hydrocarbon in their normal biological processes okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#106:1:A>
Example are bacterial decomposition of organic matter produces methane gas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#107:1:A>
Man also allows hydrocarbon to enter the atmosphere by allowing industrial solvents to evaporate
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#108:1:A>
When you are you are putting on your gasoline in your gasoline tank <indig> 'no </indig> some of the gasoline evaporates
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#109:1:A>
So this contributes to air pollution
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#110:1:A>
And also the processing and usage of petroleum
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#111:1:A>
Because of the wide variety of hydrocarbon emitted it is therefore difficult to generalize their <.> effe </.> their effects on man
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#112:1:A>
However reactive hydrocarbon plays an important role in smog formation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#113:1:A>
This will also be discussed later on
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#114:1:A>
Uh also certain hydrocarbon like benzoate pyrene has been linked to cause cancer <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#115:1:A>
Particulates are complex acids and liquids found in our atmosphere
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#116:1:A>
They are placed in the atmosphere by natural emissions like volcanic eruption or from man-made processes in industries like grinding and spraying fly ash from combustion processes and from automobile
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#117:1:A>
Of all the toxic metals found in air lead is present in the biggest concentration 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#118:1:A>
So we will focus later on on related problem lead on problem of lead accumulation in the air
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#119:1:A>
Now lead comes from the burning of gasoline where it is added as anti-knock agent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#120:1:A>
So it is an additive in gasoline
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#121:1:A>
So when you when they blend the gasoline they put it in the gasoline station they already have lead in it uh because they use it as an anti-knock agent
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#122:1:A>
Then oxide of nitrogen or nitrogen oxide generally referred to as N O X okay are generated mainly by automobile and the electric power plants
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#123:1:A>
The most significant environmental effect of N O X emission is its role in smog formation <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#124:1:A>
Nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide are known to cause fading in acetate cotton and rayon fibers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#125:1:A>
Yellowing of white fabrics has been shown to occur in the presence of nitrogen oxide
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#126:1:A>
Nitric oxide is not an irritant and its main toxic potential results from its oxidation to N O two
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-048#127:1:A>
So what is an irritant is N O Two not nitric oxide nitric oxide is N two O
