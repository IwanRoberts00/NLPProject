Joining us now Jing is uh Senate President Franklin Drilon who has

Legislature </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#16:1:A>
Good afternoon good afternoon uh <.> Sena </.> Mr Senate President

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#17:1:B>
Good afternoon Pia

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#18:1:A>
Yes Sir a a report first on what happened in the Senate this
morning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#19:1:A>
I 'm sure <indig> kaya po kayo nakangiti ngayon <{> <[> ano </[> 
 </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#20:1:B>
<[> Well it was </[> </{> a ceremonial opening uh consistent
with our tradition and agreements arrived at
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#21:1:B>
So we opened the session formally and after the national anthem we
suspended the session in order that we can listen to the President 's State
of the Nation Address here

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#22:1:A>
Now that Senator Jaworski is on the the <.> admininis </.> in
the administration camp does this mean that this will be better sailing for
all of us <{> <[> for <unclear> words </unclear> </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#23:1:B>
<[> Well uh we uh </[> </{> hope that the opposition will
cooperate with us
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#24:1:B>
Before uh the Senator Jaworski transferred to the opposition we had
an agreement with the opposition that we will have a common legislative
agenda and regardless of who has the majority would follow that legislative
agenda
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#25:1:B>
I would like to think that that agreement is still valid and I am
inviting our opposition colleagues to uh join hands with us in order to push
this common legislative agenda

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#26:1:A>
What would you yes go ahead

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#27:1:B>
I have asked I have designated Senator Villar and Senator
Legarda to uh to uh represent the administration in discussions with the
minority group

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#28:1:A>
What would you like to hear uh from the President this
afternoon in her State of the Nation Address

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#29:1:B>
Well uh I would like to hear her address uh what we perceive
to be the three major areas of concern uh graft and corruption uh we have uh
the uh the uh peace and order and uh the the power situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#30:1:B>
These are the three areas where I believe the people would uh like
to see some progress in the next twelve months

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#31:1:A>

Uhm Jing the information that we 're getting is uh I suppose
quite limited because we wouldn't we wouldn't want to uh preempt the
President uh for her State of the Nation Address
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#43:1:A>
We got a very general outline that 's what we expect
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#44:1:A>
But I 'm sure yes there will be some mention about uh uh R P - U S
relations uh especially now that the <indig> Balikatan </indig> <&> = joint
military training exercises </&> is about to end
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#45:1:A>
<indig> Balikatan </indig> O two dash one is about to end July
thirty-first and that there will be other <indig> Balikatans </indig> uh and
that R P - U S relations are expected to get stronger I suppose uh especially
now that there 's talk about signing of an M L S A Mutual Logistical Support
Agreement

We have information here that about four opposition Senators are
not going to make it to this afternoon 's State of the Nation Address uh
 <indig> sina </indig> Senators Panfilo Lacson Tessie Aquino-Oreta Loi
Ejercito and Greg Honasan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#79:1:A>
It is not clear if uh this is a boycott on the parts on the part of
the opposition Senators or <indig> hindi lang sila makakarating </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#80:1:A>
<indig> Hindi malinaw talaga yung dahilan </indig> but we are sure
that we 've been told that these four Senators are not going to make it this
afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#81:1:A>
Speaking about the opposition we have with us right now here at the
lobby of the <indig> Batasang Pambansa </indig> building someone who has just
joined the opposition here at the lower house the House of Representatives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#82:1:A>
<indig> Yung hiningi mo kanina </indig> Jing Congressman Ted Failon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#83:1:A>
Hi Ted thank you for joining us <&> long interview </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#84:1:A>
Jing also uh uh we of course we all know that the <indig> 
 <indig> Batasang Pambansa </indig> </indig> ever <.> s </.> has just been
newly refurbished
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#85:1:A>
Uh this is the first since it was inaugurated in nineteen
seventy-eight twenty-four years ago to be exact
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#86:1:A>
The Session Hall boasts of a new ceiling walls and a new carpet
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#87:1:A>
The old royal blue carpet was uh torn out to make way <{> <[> for a
new wool carpet </[> although still royal blue but with borders in
contrasting hues

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#88:1:C>
<[> Eight million pesos <indig> daw yan </indig> Pia </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#89:1:A>
Jing you 're asking about costs
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#90:1:A>
Uh this was uh this cost the House of Representatives about seven
point five million four million for the ceiling <indig> dahil yung ibang
parte daw ng </indig> ceiling <indig> nagli- </indig> leak <indig> na kasi
 </indig> and the three point five million for the flooring
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#91:1:A>
As a matter of fact according to the workers that removed the old
blue royal the old royal blue carpet <indig> pag tanggal daw ng </indig> 
carpet there was about an inch thick of dust under that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#92:1:A>
So I guess it was really about time to to do something about the
Session Hall so that uh <indig> kung baga </indig> inauguration <indig> ng
bagong </indig> Session Hall <indig> ngayong hapon sa </indig> when uh the
President delivers her second State of the Nation Address

people would want to hear uh about in the President 's speech today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#101:1:C>
Meantime we 're back in the studio <&> break in recording </&> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#102:1:F>
Once more rallyists converged here along the stretch of
Commonwealth Avenue here at the corner of <indig> Batasan </indig> Road
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#103:1:F>
And right now Jing they just finished burning effigies of the
different symbolic uh anti-terrorism or anti-government slogans that they
have against the uh the State uh of the Nation Address to be made by
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#104:1:F>
Right now you just can see the burnt remi remains or remnants of
the effigies that were just burned a few minutes ago and uh right now the
stretch of Commonwealth Avenue is uh blocked on this portion <{> <[> and </[> 
the <?> converging </?> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#105:1:C>
<[> Ricky </[> </{> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#106:1:F>
Yes Jing

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#107:1:C>
What side is blocked
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#108:1:C>
Is this the southbound lane or northbound lane

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#109:1:F>
This is the lane going towards the Elliptical Road <{> <[> 
 <,> </[> and the opposite lane is the one moving that you could see going
towards Fairview Jing

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#110:1:C>
<[> Okay </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#111:1:C>
Uh huh okay

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#112:1:F>
Right now there are three uh groups of rallyists that are
spread out in this area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#113:1:F>
This is the biggest group that has been concentrated on here on
the corner of <indig> Batasan </indig> Road and Commonwealth where estimated
number is about probably <indig> mga </indig> five to eight thousand uh uh
rallyists here at this corner alone
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#114:1:F>
And on the other groups they are converging probably over two
thousand more at the uh near the uh front of the Saint Peter 's Church and
that one near the Don Antonio intersection of Commonwealth Avenue
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#115:1:F>
On the other side of the uh Commonwealth Avenue you could see Jing
that there are the contingents of the Philippine National Police lined up
along the island with their respective shields and barriers to avoid the uh
the uh oncoming rallyists to be able to cross towards the area of the <indig> 
Batasan </indig> complex
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#116:1:F>
And as you could see Jing uh there is uh some uh uh movement also
of other groups coming from the PHILCOA area <.> co </.> they 're actually
already very near the Don Antonio stretch
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#117:1:F>
Right now Jing the uh atmosphere from the air as you could see is
uh still quite normal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#118:1:F>
It seems that everything 's still on a normal situation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#119:1:F>
A few minutes ago Jing we saw the uh helicopter bearing the uh
President uh Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who just flew in via their helicopter
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#120:1:F>
A blue and white helicopter just landed inside the <indig> Batasan
 </indig> complex and uh and we could see that uh it is now hovering over this
area so we

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#121:1:C>
Ricky she 's uh actually she 's actually inside the <indig> 
Batasan </indig> complex already
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#122:1:C>
We 're going to get back to you
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#123:1:C>

<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#124:1:C>
Thanks Ricky we 'll go back to you later
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#125:1:C>
Uh ladies and gentlemen if you 're if you noticed we 've switched
from the video of Ricky Velasco
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#126:1:C>
He was showing a video of Commonwealth Avenue and the lane going
towards the Elliptical Circle well coming from Fairview is blocked by
rallyists
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-004#127:1:C>
At this point there 's only one lane open and that lane is going
towards Fairview </I>
