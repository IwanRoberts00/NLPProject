NORTH COTABATO - -

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#4:1>
In the outskirts of Kidapawan, the capital town of Cotabato, an uneasy
calm now prevails.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#5:1>
In most homes, curtains are drawn and windows closed at 7 p.m.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#6:1>
You can count on your fingers the number of tricycles still plying the
streets at dusk.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#7:1>
In peaceful Roxas Street near the Kidapawan National High School, a 'salvage'
<&> ( in Philippine English, summarily executed - that 's why the word is in
scare quotes) </&> victim was recently dumped.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#8:1>
The body was never identified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#9:1>
When the last bus is dispatched to Cotabato City, no driver will
dare pass through the military zones of Kabacan and Pikit at sundown.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#10:1>
Just last week, several ambushes took place along the highway.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#11:1>
Business activities have practically stopped in Midsayap, an 80%
Christian area about 30 kms from Kidapawan.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#12:1>
No amount of money would lure an L-300 or tricycle driver to pass
through the war zones of Pikit and Kabacan going back to Kidapawan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#13:1>
Heavy fighting between government troops and the <indig> Moro
</indig> Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF) in Cotabato in recent weeks has led
to the displacement of at least 80,000 residents from their homes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#14:1>
They are now housed in various schools turned evacuation centers,
where they face an uncertain future. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#15:1>
<h> <bold> Roots of the conflict </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#16:1>
The source of conflict in Cotabato, however, is not kidnapping,
as the Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP) claims, but the government 's
effort to develop Liguasan Marsh. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#17:1>
Cotabato Police Director Jainal Jamasali disclosed that only one
kidnapping case has been reported since January of this year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#18:1>
Jamasali said the 43 PNOC ( Philippine National Oil Corp.)
personnel digging for oil who were kidnapped in <indig> Sultan sa Barongis
</indig> last June 12 were rescued the same day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#19:1>
AFP 's Task Force <indig> Tugis </indig> , reinforced by a
contingent of six army battalions, subsequently assaulted the MILF camp in
Rajamuda, Pikit, &ldquo; their retreat route &rdquo; from Sultan sa Barongis.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#20:1>
Government troops have been deployed in the first congressional
district of Pikit, Aleosan, Carmen, Midsayap and Kabacan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#21:1>
Government claims the Marsh is state-owned but the <indig> Moro
</indig> people believe otherwise.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#22:1>
The Marsh is home to many Maguindanaos who oppose government 's
grandiose plan to develop &ldquo; their land. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#23:1>
They likewise assert that the project will not benefit their poor
Muslim brothers but their political elite. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#24:1>
Kidapawan radio station DXND noted that the Malitubog-Maridagao
Irrigation Project ( MalMar) in the Liguasan Marsh has sparked skirmishes
between MILF and police since 1992 until January of this year.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#25:1>
The National Irrigation Administration ( NIA) project covers some
8,760 hectares of the Lower Malitubog area in the municipalities of Pikit and
Pagalungan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#26:1>
DXND interviews with Maguindanaos living in the Liguasan
periphery disclosed that those who stand to gain from the irrigation project
will be the Matalams and other rich landowners in the Marsh.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#27:1>
The critics of the project said they were merely workers of these
rich <indig> Moro </indig> families. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#28:1>
The Liguasan Marsh Development Plan admits that the biggest
problem confronting the Marsh is peace and order.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#29:1>
It said that for decades the area has been a refuge for dissidents.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#30:1>
In order to correct the misconception that the introduction of
development is to wage war on rebel inhabitants, the Plan <quote> &ldquo;
necessitates more aggressive advocacy as well as solid implementation of
program interventions. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#31:1>
Fifty-one-year-old Maguindanao and state chairman of MNLF in the
province of Cotabato, Dimalao Ampel, a. k. a. Kumander Alladin, said he
joined the MNLF to pursue development for the tri-people of Mindanao--the
Muslims, Christians and the highlanders.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#32:1>
However, he expressed his reservations regarding joint-ventures with
other foreign countries for the Marsh 's development.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#33:1>
<quote> <indig> &ldquo; Kung development na makakabuti para sa lahat,
</indig> <&> ( trans. if it 's development for the good of the many) </&> why
should I be against it? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#34:1>
The MILF leadership sees the state of war as the result of
government 's aggressive thrust in implementing the
Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asia Growth Area or BIMP-EAGA
project.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#35:1>
Gadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for Political Affairs, said the
current military offensive or state of martial law in Cotabato is a means to
<quote> &ldquo; control the area." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#36:1>
He suspects it may also be part of the Malaca&ntilde;ang ploy to
extend the President 's term. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#37:1>
A splinter group of the MNLF, the MILF seeks independence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#38:1>
The MNLF, on the other hand, batted for autonomy before it concluded
a peace agreement with the government last September. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#39:1>
MILF leaders wanted to hold talks with then President Corazon
Aquino under the banner of the defunct National Unification Commission (
NUC).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#40:1>
But they felt abandoned when Malaca&ntilde;ang stopped contacting
them after then Commissioner Haydee Yorac went to the South for a possible
peace truce. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#41:1>
Exploratory peace talks between the government and MILF-- what
Amperl refers to as <quote> &ldquo; a matter of recognition from government"
</quote> - - are ongoing at present.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#42:1>
The conflict has socio-economic roots, because the benefits of
development have yet to trickle down to the 10 million <indig> Moro </indig>
people, most of whom are poor.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#43:1>
Through the years, the Maguindanaos saw how the Christian
settlements, especially those around the Marsh, developed at a fast pace.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#44:1>
They also witnessed how Christians built their business empires and
established strong political bailiwicks. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#45:1>
<h> <bold> The Liguasan Marsh Development Plan </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#46:1>
The 52,421-hectare or 524,2100,000 sq.m. Liguasan Marsh (
<mention> <indig> Ligawasan </indig> </mention> - - Maguidanaon term for
<mention> reservoir </mention> ) is situated in the central mainland of
Region 12 and part of Maguindanao Province and <foreign> Sultan </foreign>
Kudarat Province of Region 11.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#47:1>
It is surrounded by the municipalities of Pikit, Kabacan, Cotabato
and Pagalungan, Maguindanao in the north; Matalam M'lang Tulunan, all of
Cotabato and <foreign> Datu </foreign> Paglas, Maguindanao in the east; Gen.
S. K. Pendatun in the south; and <indig> Sultan sa Barongis </indig> in the
west. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#48:1>
A number of rivers flow into the Marsh.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#49:1>
Besides the Pulangi which flows into the northwestern portion, seven
other rivers converge in the area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#50:1>
The Liguasan Marsh Development Framework Plan 1996-2025 targets a
30-year development for the construction of sophisticated roads and bridges,
irrigation, flood control, ports/wharves, water supply and communications.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#51:1>
The different rivers, on the other hand, will serve as centers for
fish propagation and food production, recreational facilities, industrial
water supply and irrigation dams. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#52:1>
Rich aquatic and agricultural resources from the Marsh is being
shared by the municipalities of Pikit, M'lang, Tulunan, Matalam, Kabacan,
Midsayap, Libungan, Pigcawayan, all of Cotabato; <foreign> Datu </foreign>
Paglas, <foreign> Datu </foreign> Piang, <indig> Sultan sa Barongis </indig>
, S. K. Pendatun, Buluan and Kabuntalan in Maguindanao, and Lambayong in
Sultan Kudarat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#53:1>
Former media consultant to President Ramos and incumbent M'Lang
municipal mayor Emmanuel 'manny' Pi&ntilde;ol, averred he first revived the
idea of developing the Liguasan Marsh when the town had its first kidnapping
incident in 1992. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#54:1>
During the monthly meeting of <indig> barangay </indig> captains,
he claimed the Pi&ntilde;ols, ( his father is a former mayor) <quote> &ldquo;
showed to the whole people of Cotabato how kidnapping was stopped. &rdquo;
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#55:1>
As the concurrent chairman of the development committee that will
implement the Liguasan Marsh Plan, Pi&ntilde;ol 's main concern is to draw
investors to the Marsh. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#56:1>
Past administrations from the Commonwealth period up to the late
80s attempted to develop the Marsh.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#57:1>
But these efforts were stymied by the volatile peace and order
problem in surrounding areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#58:1>
The <indig> Moro </indig> people firmly resisted Spanish and
American colonialism and Japanese aggression.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#59:1>
The Quezon administration, however, changed the <indig> Moro </indig>
people 's way of life when it allowed Christians to settle in their homeland.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#60:1>
Prior to the great exodus of emigrants from Luzon and Visayas
during the Commonwealth period, the <indig> Moro </indig> people and
scattered indigenous peoples comprised the populace in Mindanao.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#61:1>
As a result to that policy, today the province of Cotabato is
dominated by three major ethno-linguistic groups: the Ilonggos ( 35%),
Cebuanos ( 30%) and the Maguindanaos ( 17%).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#62:1>
Bagobos, Manobos and other indigenous peoples account for 8%. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#63:1>
With the Ramos vision of fulfilling Mindanao as the <quote>
&ldquo; Land of Promise" </quote> , a blueprint for Mindanao 's development
has been laid down consisting of flagship programs and projects including the
BIMP-EAGA, SOCSARGEN and the Basilan Integrated Development Project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#64:1>
The Liguasan Marsh development, as part of that grand plan,
basically aims to uplift the economic lot of people at the grassroots,
targetting especially the Muslims.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#65:1>
The local government of Cotabato in 1996 puts poverty incidence in
the province at 46.73% out of the total 155,093 families, relatively lower
than 1991 at 61.5%.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#66:1>
Families derive their main livelihood from agri-based entrepreneurial
activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#67:1>
Around the Marsh, inhabitants are classified as marginal
fishermen, mostly Muslim.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#68:1>
Pi&ntilde;ol explained that historically the Marsh has been a place
of exile for &ldquo; socially-unacceptable &rdquo; native Maguindanaos.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#69:1>
Although conceding that the area is controlled by the MILF, he was
quick to point out that <quote> &ldquo; not all of them are MILF" </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#70:1>
Pi&ntilde;ol 's rationale for pushing the Liguasan Marsh project is
<quote> &ldquo; to teach these people how to explore the resources and
develop the area. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#71:1>
Pi&ntilde;ol is also fast-tracking the development of Liguasan
Marsh before President Ramos 's term ends because he is unsure if the next
President will understand the importance of the project.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#72:1>
In a dialogue with 37 <indig> barangay </indig> captains, he
announced his intention to run as congressional candidate for the first
district next year to assure the continuity of programs he has already begun
in the area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#73:1>
Support for the development plan has been committed by the
national government and the private sector.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#74:1>
The New Zealand government has also committed financial assistance.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#75:1>
Pi&ntilde;ol has submitted the plan to the National Economic
Development Authority ( NEDA) for full completion of the feasibility studies.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#76:1>
<h> <bold> Complications </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#77:1>
The state of war in Cotabato province has placed various sectors
and stakeholders in the same mire.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#78:1>
The rich farmlands of Cotabato have been abandoned by both Muslim and
Christian peasants.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#79:1>
As of last week, according to Jaafar, there were already 80,000
Muslims who had evacuated to different refugee centers to escape bombings and
destruction of lives and properties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#80:1>
Some Muslim elders frankly admitted they were more scared of the
AFP than the MILF because when they come, they bomb and attack without mercy.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#81:1>
A truckload of sand from the municipal government of Pikit sent
to the interior was discovered to contain rice and other goods, implicating
its Muslim mayor as supporter of the MILF.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#82:1>
But employees from the office of the local government said the mayor
cannot be blamed because the MILF members are his relatives.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#83:1>
In a Muslim crisis-situation, they say blood is thicker than
politics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#84:1>
The Diocese of Kidapawan, always in the forefront of human rights
protection, dispatched its second relief mission to Kabacan last week to give
away a truckload of rice, dried fish, clothing and medicines to elders, women
and children.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#85:1>
The evacuation centers in Tunggol, Pagagawan and Salapungan were
replete with uncertainty and mirrored the extent of the Muslims ' poverty.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#86:1>
Most of the evacuees in Kabacan came from the areas of
Pagalungan, <foreign> Datu </foreign> Paglas, Pikit, Lumayog and Ugalingan.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#87:1>
Elementary graders have stopped going to school.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#88:1>
Teachers in the school-turned-evacuation center were saddened by the
situation that would deprive the Muslim children the opportunity to learn.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#89:1>
In fact, they told of how their pupils, children of poor peasant
Muslim families, would go to school with rice and <mention> Silver Swan
</mention> ( brand of soy sauce) as meal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#90:1>
Majority of the Moslem children often do not reach intermediate
schooling because they are forced to lend a hand in production. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#91:1>
Church workers bewail the brash attitude of some Muslims,
especially those who have had little education.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#92:1>
In Pagagawan, non-evacuees threatened to block the truck of goods if
they did not get their share.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#93:1>
Fr. Lito Garcia, parish priest of Kabacan, explained that the
war-situation normally breeds the dole-out mentality among the poor Muslims
who are assured of their meals for at least several days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#94:1>
In Salapungan, evacuee statistics dropped from 900 on the first
day of refuge to 112 the next few days.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#95:1>
Asked where the men are, as those present were mostly elders, women,
children and frail youth, the answers were standard: <quote> &ldquo; they 're
in the farm. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#96:1>
Some of Kabacan 's church workers deny they are feeding the
rebels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#97:1>
An LGU employee who requested anonymity disclosed that the powers
now being enjoyed by the commanders of the MILF have made the <foreign> datus
</foreign> mere figureheads of authority.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#98:1>
When commanders swoop down on villages to take away the young men as
trainees, the families can only protest in silence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#99:1>
The cycle of violence continues, said this source, as the fathers and
grandfathers of these young men were the same fighters during military and
Muslim encounters in the 70s and 80s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#100:1>
The tense atmosphere has serious repercussions on investments,
said the two sources from the provincial capitol.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#101:1>
They said the towns of Carmen, Pikit and some parts of Kabacan were
well-off municipalities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#102:1>
Rajamuda, the so-called MILF camp, had facilities like schools,
hospitals, <foreign> etc. </foreign> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#103:1>
When investments were infused in the past years, Cotabato City
greatly improved, they said.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#104:1>
There was steady growth for Cotabato from 1995 to 1997, they
recalled, but this was highly concentrated in the second district, the
so-called <mention> &ldquo; safe areas &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#105:1>
Overall, despite the peace problem, the whole of Cotabato from
1995-1996 got some &peso;1 billion in investments, &peso;518 of this placed
in the agro-based sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#106:1>
<quote> &ldquo; All the mechanisms for investments and marketing
in Cotabato province have already been in place.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#107:1>
In fact, we have the Cotabato Investment Promotions Center.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#108:1>
Aside from this, the Investments Code of Cotabato Province is ready
for implementation", </quote> the sources said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#109:1>
But Fr. Ronnie Villamor, administrator of the Diocese of
Kidapawan, understands why the Maguindanao situation has gotten out of hand.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#110:1>
Budget-wise, he said, Mindanao receives a minimal allocation for
infrastructure and services compared to Luzon and Visayas.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-014#111:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Yet Mindanao feeds the rest of the population &rdquo; ,
</quote> he said. </p> </I>
