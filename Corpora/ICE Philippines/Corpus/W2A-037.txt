<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#11:1>
In traditional computer networks, such as X.25 and TCP/IP
networks, packets generally traverse the lowest cost route going from one
source to one destination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#12:1>
The routing strategy has proven effective for services such as batch
file transfer and interactive remote login.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#13:1>
In recent years, new classes or computer and video services have
emerged that transfer multiple copies of a packet from one source to many
destinations.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#14:1>
Applications such as videoconferencing, parallel search of
distributed databases, multiple address email, and email distribution lists
can flood a computer network with multiple copies of a single packet that
will consume the capacity or the resources of the network.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#15:1>
This situation is similar to broadcasting or flooding algorithms.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#16:1>
Transmission of a packet from one to many destinations is called
<mention> multicasting [ COM, TANb], or multipoint routing, or multiple
destination routing ( MDR) [ TANa] </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#17:1>
The extreme case, where the packet is sent to all possible
destinations ( except the source), is called <mention> broadcasting
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#18:1>
The objective of routing strategies is to conserve network bandwidth
or lower the cost of transmitting packets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#19:1>
In networks with broadcast media such as IEEE 802.3 ( Ethernet)
or VSAT networks broadcasting of packets is achieved by the normal operation
of the medium.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#20:1>
However, in networks with a mesh topology, broadcasting strategies
have to be deliberately defined.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#21:1>
Otherwise, packets may loop or return to the sender.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#22:1>
A popular choice is to route broadcast packets along a spanning tree.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#23:1>
This paper models the broadcast routing problem in a mesh
computer network as a group theory problem with a cost function that has to
be minimized.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#24:1>
The purpose of this paper is to propose a new criterion for routing
broadcast packets if each node in the network may be a source of broadcast
packets directed to the other nodes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#25:1>
Constraining broadcast packets to follow a single spanning tree, it
will be shown that a minimum diameter spanning tree is a suitable choice for
routing purposes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#26:1>
A heuristic for generating a minimum diameter spanning tree is
presented. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#27:1>
<h> <bold> SPANNING TREES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#28:1>
A network is modeled by a weighted non-directed graph consisting
of nodes v and links 1 <sb> j </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#29:1>
For the j-th link, a link weight w <sb> j </sb> represents some
general cost of transporting one packet across the link, such as physical
distance between nodes, average transmit time, time delay or economic cost.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#30:1>
Alternatively, the link weight may be made inversely proportional to
the transmission capacity ( bandwidth) so that a higher weight implies a less
desirable link.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#31:1>
Figure 1 shows an example of a network with link weights. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#32:1>
A path from a source node to a destination node is a connected
sequence of nodes and links in which no node appears more than once ( i. e.
that has no loops).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#33:1>
The weight or cost of the path is defined as the sum of weights w
<sb> j </sb> for the links l <sb> i </sb> in the path. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#34:1>
The shortest path between two nodes v <sb> A </sb> and v <sb> B
</sb> is that path that has the smallest path weight among all paths
connecting the two nodes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#35:1>
The distance d(v <sb> A </sb> , v <sb> B </sb> ) between the two
nodes is defined as the weight of the shortest path.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#36:1>
The shortest path, as well as the distance, are easily obtained with
standard graph theory algorithms such as Dijkstra 's algorithm [ DEO]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#37:1>
The shortest paths from a given source node v <sb> A </sb> to all
other nodes form a rooted spanning tree that we shall call a shortest path
tree ( sometimes called a <mention> Dijkstra tree </mention> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#38:1>
Alternatively, routing algorithms can also use a minimum spanning
tree ( MST) or shortest spanning tree, defined as the spanning tree having
the smallest weight.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#39:1>
( The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of the link
weights of all the links in the tree.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#40:1>
) The minimum spanning tree is constructed using either Prim 's
algorithm or Kruskal 's algorithm [ DEO]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#41:1>
Given a mesh network such as Figure 1, a spanning tree can be
chosen for purposes of routing broadcast packets from one node to the other
nodes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#42:1>
Routing along a tree is simple and attractive since from any source
node there is exactly one path to every destination node.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#43:1>
The tree ensures that every destination will be reached, and that no
loops will exist for packets to circulate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#44:1>
Various broadcast strategies are discussed in [ TAN]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#45:1>
In some protocols used by LAN bridges, nodes cooperate in
handling broadcast packets so that only one packet is sent along each link.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#46:1>
When a node with two or more outgoing links receives a broadcast
packet, it will forward one copy along each outgoing direction.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#47:1>
With this strategy, the total cost of routing packets from one source
to all destinations is the tree weight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#48:1>
<O> formula </O> where the summation is taken over all links i in
the tree.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#49:1>
Clearly, the sum is minimized by routing packets along a minimum
spanning tree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#50:1>
However, there are cases where a separate packet must be sent
from the source to each destination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#51:1>
For example, blind courtesy copies ( typically called <mention> bcc
</mention> ) of email carry a different address in the mail header for each
destination, although the body of the mail will be identical for all copies.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#52:1>
Mass mailing, or mailing lists, also typically send one separate copy
of mail for each addressee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#53:1>
In this case, the cost of routing packets from one source node S
is given by the total weight of all paths originating from S ( i.e. the total
distance of all nodes from S): <O> formula </O> where the summation is taken
over all nodes j.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#54:1>
The cost c(s, v <sb> j </sb> ) is the weight of the path taken by
packets going from node S to node v <sb> j </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#55:1>
Then, the lowest cost is obtained by routing along a shortest path
tree rooted at node S so that c(S, v <sb> j </sb> ) = d(S, v <sb> j </sb> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#56:1>
Such a tree can be constructed using Dijkstra 's algorithm to
simultaneously find the shortest paths to all nodes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#57:1>
For example, the Open Shortest Path First ( OSPF) routing algorithm
is based on Dijkstra tree [ PER]. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#58:1>
We observe that in general, the shortest spanning tree and the
shortest path tree are different.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#59:1>
This is illustrated by Figure 2 for a source node S at the lower left
corner of the path.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#60:1>
Secondly, we observe that there will be different shortest path trees
from different source routes in the graph.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#61:1>
For example, if the tree in Figure 2(b) were used for the source at
the lower right node, the total distance of all nodes would be C = 34, which
is obviously not the lowest possible cost. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#62:1>
<h> <bold> BROADCASTING FROM MANY SOURCES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#63:1>
In future applications envisioned for high speed networks, every
node can potentially be a source of broadcast packets.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#64:1>
For example, in future distributed databases, one way for a client to
locate data may be to broadcast a query to all databases servers.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#65:1>
( The alternative is to query each database sequentially.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#66:1>
Assume that each destination is sent a separate copy of the
broadcast packet.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#67:1>
Suppose that we would like the broadcast packets to traverse a single
tree in order to simplify the routing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#68:1>
Given a network graph with a mesh topology, the issue is how to pick
the best spanning tree for this purpose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#69:1>
In a network in which each of N nodes can be a broadcast source,
the average cost per source of routing packets along a single tree is <O>
formula </O>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#70:1>
Here the distance d(v <sb> i </sb> , v <sb> j </sb> ) between source
v <sb> i </sb> and the destination v <sb> j </sb> is taken as the weight of
the unique path along the tree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#71:1>
Therefore, the best spanning tree for routing broadcast packets
is that which minimizes the cost criterion <O> formula </O>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#72:1>
This cost represents the sum of distances taken between all pairs of
nodes in the spanning tree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#73:1>
In this cost criterion, the i-th link contributes the link weight
w <sb> i </sb> multiplied by the number of paths that traverse the link, when
paths between all pairs of nodes are counted.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#74:1>
Consider a representative tree shown in Figure 3.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#75:1>
For link i of this tree, the number of paths is equal to the product
of the number of nodes on the left side of the link ( 3) and the number of
nodes on the right side ( 6).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#76:1>
Thus, a total of 18 broadcast paths can pass through link i. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#77:1>
For link i of a tree, let N <sb> iL </sb> be the number of nodes
to the left of the link, and N <sb> iR </sb> be the number of nodes to the
right of the link.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#78:1>
Then the cost ( Equation 3) can be expressed alternatively as <O>
formula </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#79:1>
Observe that the more dissimilar the terms are, the smaller is
the product N <sb> iL </sb> N <sb> iR </sb> ( where the sum N <sb> iL </sb> +
N <sb> iR </sb> = N, a constant).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#80:1>
As the terms become closer, the larger the product becomes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#81:1>
Thus, this product N <sb> iL </sb> N <sb> iR </sb> is minimized by
making one term equal to units and the other equal to N-1, if possible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#82:1>
Based on this consideration, the ideal spanning tree is a star (
see Figure 4).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#83:1>
Notice that the distance between nodes in a star network are as short
as possible, so that the cost ( 3) is also made smaller.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#84:1>
However, it is not always possible to find a spanning tree with a
star topology.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#85:1>
Then a two-level ( or multi-level) star such as that shown in Figure
5 may be the best. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#86:1>
In networks with sparse connections, we cannot always hope to
find a spanning tree with a multi-level star topology.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#87:1>
So we come back to the question of constructing a spanning tree to
minimize the cost criterion Equation 3 and Equation 4. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#88:1>
<h> <bold> MINIMUM DIAMETER SPANNING TREE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#89:1>
Given a network graph with a mesh topology, we would like to
construct a spanning tree that minimizes the cost criterion Equation 3 or
Equation 4.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#90:1>
Note that this cost is the sum of distances taken between all pairs
of nodes in the spanning tree.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#91:1>
Thus it makes sense to select a tree in which the longest path is as
small as possible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#92:1>
We define the diameter of a graph as the largest distance between
two nodes [ DEO].

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#93:1>
It follows that the diameter of a spanning tree is the longest path
along the tree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#94:1>
We conjecture that a minimum diameter spanning tree minimizes, or
approaches the minimum of, the cost ( 3).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#95:1>
Therefore, we seek to construct a tree that achieves where the
minimum is taken over all spanning trees of the graph.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#96:1>
Observe that in a graph with a mesh topology, the minimum tree
diameter D <sb> t </sb> is lower bounded by the diameter of the graph D <sb>
g </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#97:1>
For suppose this were not true and the diameter of the spanning tree
D <sb> t </sb> is less than the diameter of the graph D <sb> g </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#98:1>
Then the largest distance between two nodes is D <sb> t </sb> and
this contradicts the assumption that the largest distance between two nodes
in the graph is D <sb> g </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#99:1>
On the other hand, it is easy to produce examples for which the
minimum tree diameter is larger than the graph diameter.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#100:1>
A common example is a graph with ring topology ( " ring &rdquo; or
&ldquo; loop &rdquo; network). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#101:1>
To illustrate the above ideas, the graph in Figure 1 has a
diameter of 6.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#102:1>
The minimum diameter tree is shown in Figure 2a, with a cost of 116
computed from either Equation ( 3) or Equation ( 4).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#103:1>
The shortest path tree in Figure 2b is inferior because its diameter
is 10 and the cost by Equation 3 is 154. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#104:1>
Since there are not many algorithms for finding the minimum
diameter tree in the literature we use the following heuristic:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#105:1>
1. Find the shortest path between the two nodes that are
furthest apart in the graph, and call this the starting subtree.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#106:1>
That is, find the path that determines the diameter of the graph.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#107:1>
( Intuitively, this seems to be a logical choice.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#108:1>
Suppose the two nodes that are furthest apart are denoted by v <sb>
l </sb> and v <sb> N </sb> ; they are connected by a path having weight D
<sb> g </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#109:1>
If the path is not included in the minimum diameter tree, then for
sure D <sb> t </sb> is strictly greater than D <sb> g </sb> .) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#110:1>
2. For each node not in the starting subtree, connect the node
to the starting subtree in such a way that the increase in tree diameter is
minimized.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#111:1>
If there are several connecting paths that satisfy this condition,
use the one with the shortest path to the starting subtree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#112:1>
This algorithm produced the spanning tree in Figure 2a. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#113:1>
<h> <bold> CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#114:1>
This paper has presented a new criterion for routing broadcast
packets in a computer network if each node in the network may be a source of
broadcast packets directed to the other nodes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#115:1>
Constraining broadcast packets to follow a single spanning tree, it
is shown that a minimum diameter spanning tree is a suitable choice for
routing purposes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#116:1>
A heuristic for generating a minimum diameter spanning tree is
presented. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#117:1>
The discussion should motivate a search for good algorithms to
generate minimum diameter spanning trees.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-037#118:1>
The heuristic algorithm presented can also be further investigated
to determine how close its solutions are to the desired minimum diameter
tree. </p> </I>
