<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#1:1:A>
<unclear> words </unclear> two hours from Manila two hours from Cebu two hours by travel from Davao and Zamboanga
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#2:1:A>
So now we are able to prioritize and uh sort of uh veer off from the traditional shotgun type of development okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#3:1:A>
We 're developed everywhere but not really anywhere

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#4:1:B>
I I just wanted to find out when you uh have identified each development area uh have you already come up with uh specific activities towards the development of each of these areas

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#5:1:A>
We agreed and this was uh upon the recommendation of the planners that we should focus and come up with models
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#6:1:A>
So in the case of Davao of the Mindanao cluster we have <.> id </.> identified an area in Samal Island as the ideal place to set up an example
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#7:1:A>
And this is the the Samal Island Resort Estate Company
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#8:1:A>
That is what we would like to see in the next couple of months <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#9:1:A>
And this is also true in the case of uh of <unclear> word </unclear> <O> music </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#10:1:C>
Air resort or tourism estate similar to the industrial estate being promoted by government involves the purchase and infrastructure development and incentive programs development by the government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#11:1:C>
For sale to private investors of large tracts of land
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#12:1:C>
For resort building
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#13:1:C>
The advantage of the resort estate concept is that it removes stumbling blocks for prospective tourism investors

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#14:1:A>
The idea is for us to buy it first

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#15:1:C>
Uh uhm

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#16:1:A>
And then put the initial land development like roads <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#17:1:A>
With the help of course of D P W H
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#18:1:A>
And then set up the communication system with the help of D O T C
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#19:1:A>
And in the case again of Samal we 're working with the Regional Development Council
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#20:1:A>
We have tracked down what are the programmed infrastructure activities that are scheduled there and so we 're trying to push that faster <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#21:1:B>
So I have gone over the details of the cluster development 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#22:1:B>
I think it 's just uh it 's okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#23:1:B>
It 's a very good uh grouping actually because especially in the long term with the objective of each cluster
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#24:1:B>
Like they have Luzon for the multifaceted uh aspects of tourism and Visayas as a resort center and Mindanao for the culture

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#25:1:C>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#26:1:B>
And so on
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#27:1:B>
I think it 's a very good <unclear> word </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#28:1:B>
But what I would really like to see I wonder if it 's at all possible to prioritize certain aspects of the development or to expedite all of the airports that we 've targeted for improvement which is the San Fernando La Union Airport
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#29:1:B>
Uh a few months ago we uh approached uh Secretary Estanislao for funding support uh and uh he gave us his uh whole-hearted approval 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#30:1:B>
And he intends to secure funds from the Philippine aid plan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#31:1:B>
The upon completion of the uh widening and lengthening of the San Fernando La Union Airport uh we would now have the opportunity to bring in uh two inclusive air charters from uh our target markets in East Asia like Korea Japan Hong Kong uh and Singapore
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#32:1:B>
Uh especially those markets who would like to have the uh the uh beaches of uh Ilocos and the uh the mountain air of the Cordilleras
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#33:1:B>
Well uh in addition to the San Fernando La Union airport uh we have uh through the P T A uh set aside uh uh about two hundred fifty million pesos for the improvement of the Mactan International Airport
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#34:1:B>
Uh it 's an integrated project that uh will require also funding from O E C F
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#35:1:B>
Uh where we come in is in uh phase one of the project that calls for the uh uh <,> building of a new uh international terminal
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#36:1:B>
And uh based on uh current plans the uh the terminal will be open for business uh within uh a few months
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#37:1:B>
And the idea here is to ensure that uh uh we can accommodate uh uh more air traffic into Mactan International Airport and decongest in the process uh Ninoy Aquino International Airport where ninety-eight percent of the tourist traffic flows through at the present time

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#38:1:D>
That 's true uh I 'll bring up the importance of gateway simply because I can immediately see two advantages of the master plan for the tour operators <indig> 'no </indig> because the the these development areas immediately solve two problems of the operators here in the Philippines right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#39:1:D>
First of all the marketing thing we now can go into product enhancement product diversification and a whole lot of other product activities
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#40:1:D>
Then another one is operationally it solves our problem with the clogging and the crowding of Manila

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#41:1:C>
Uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#42:1:D>
So it 's it becomes easy for us to work <indig> 'no </indig> and operate our programs with different gateways <indig> 'no </indig> 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#43:1:E>
How many hotel rooms Mr Secretary <,> are slated to to be in the next uh let 's say six years ten years uh any figures any facts

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#44:1:F>
We are calling for an additional uh thirty-three thousand rooms on top of the existing twenty-two thousand hotel and resort rooms throughout the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#45:1:F>
However of the thirty-three thousand uh roughly about sixteen thousand are now presently being uh built

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#46:1:E>
Yes that 's right

 <$F 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#47:1:F>
So uh we will probably we will still need an additional uh uh seventeen thousand rooms
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#48:1:F>
Now we believe that uh with uh increasing traffic flows into the country investments for additional accommodations will naturally follow
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#49:1:F>
A lot of them will be built outside of course there 's still room for uh for more hotels in Metro Manila

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#50:1:E>
Okay

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#51:1:F>
But uh a a big percentage will be dispersed throughout the country

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#52:1:E>
Therefore uh we have now gateways we have hotel rooms trained people

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#53:1:F>
Yes we will have regional training centers
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#54:1:F>
We will have the uh the theoretical institutions as well as the on-the-job training institutions to support the uh the uh mother school 

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#55:1:E>
Right

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#56:1:C>
Uh uhm

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#57:1:D>
I would like to find out if there 's room in it for education
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#58:1:D>
When I say education it 's not the human resources development but education on the public and education of the other sectors of government about tourism
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#59:1:D>
Because the master plan to succeed needs the cooperation of other government sector and also the support of the people
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#60:1:D>
And like you said uh earlier the everybody has the wrong concept that tourism is the frills thing industry
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#61:1:D>
They overlook that it 's a very important economic activity
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#62:1:D>
Would the tourism master plan have a budget or allotment for the education of our <,> congressmen our senators or other cabinet members the public in general <O> laughter </O> 

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#63:1:F>
Yes the tourism master plan uh calls for a uh a an increase in uh the advertising and promotions budget
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#64:1:F>
Uh that uh will include uh in the plan a tourism awareness campaign
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#65:1:F>
Uh you 're right uh it 's very important for the general public at large to rally behind the tourism master plan because this plan is not government mandated
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#66:1:F>
It 's it 's a plan that uh will ensure uh tremendous changes in the economic landscape that will benefit everybody in this country
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#67:1:F>
So uh because of of the national interest uh it behooves all of us uh to rally behind this plan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#68:1:F>
And to to do that it is important as you said uh for us to launch a systematic and methodical uh tourism awareness campaign
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#69:1:F>
For example uhm it is critical to get our taxi drivers involved uh in uh in tourism development
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#70:1:F>
All it takes is for a particular frontliner like a policeman like uh a taxi driver uh to to commit a misdemeanor against a tourist 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#71:1:F>
That can destroy the the image of uh of uh the Philippines in the eyes of this tourist
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#72:1:F>
And the worst thing that can happen to a country is a negative word by mouth advertising or disadvertising
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#73:1:F>
Uhm it 's important also for example to get our policy makers uh uh to understand the implications of the tourism master plan because uh in the process uh if they do not correct certain infirmities uh that exist today then it would be very very difficult for example to get our uh budgets uh synchronized uh and uh and uh integrated into the uh master plan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#74:1:F>
Let us not forget that uh tourism is a very powerful economic tool
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#75:1:F>
And uh if I look and I 'm sure everybody in in the industry joins me in this view that uh uh tourism can be effectively used to alleviate poverty in the countryside

 <$E> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#76:1:E>
Of course it will

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#77:1:F>
Yet it can also assist in urban renewal because as more jobs are created in the end in the countryside then the decongestion of uh the urban areas especially Metro Manila can then take place

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#78:1:C>
Okay <O> music </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#79:1:C>
A tourism development program such as that envisioned by the master plan naturally has wide ranging implications on transportation policy
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#80:1:C>
Primarily aviation policies
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#81:1:C>
This would necessarily involve the national carrier Philippine Airlines

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#82:1:G>
Well uh right now we would like to seek the help of the government the D O T in seeking more liberal uh arrangements with uh countries like Australia Japan Canada Italy Spain and <.> Unit </.> United Kingdom
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#83:1:G>
These are our main sources of tourists
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#84:1:G>
And present uh air agreements with these countries are so restrictive that we could not grow any further
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#85:1:G>
Take the case of Japan
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#86:1:G>
Right now Philippine Airlines is already maximum using its maximum uh <.> ra </.> uh <.> sea </.> seats in Japan and yet Japan Airlines is only utilizing sixty percent of its uh potential of its rights
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#87:1:G>
And to think that uh ten million Japanese travel out of Japan every year
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#88:1:G>
We are really only getting roughly about two percent of this ten million
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#89:1:G>
We would want to tap that market
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#90:1:G>
It 's so near to us but we would like the Philippine government to help us get these rights
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#91:1:G>
And then as far as uh charters are concerned Philippine Airlines would be uh supportive of these provided that these groups are really genuine chartered inclusive tour groups
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#92:1:G>
In other words uh affinity affinity groups
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#93:1:G>
They are residents and citizens of the foreign countries from way from where they originate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#94:1:G>
And that they do not uh supplant the present scheduled air carriers from these countries
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#95:1:G>
Like say in the case of Japan Japan Airlines and Philippine Airlines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#96:1:G>
Uh we would like to see them and uh we would want them to supplement the present air scheduled services not supplant them
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#97:1:G>
Now we would like also to see the other airlines bring in more tourists to the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#98:1:G>
I don't know whether any of you know that Philippine Airlines bring say one thousand seven hundred percent more Dutch than K L M
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#99:1:G>
We bring four hundred percent more <,> British than <.> Unite </.> than British Airways
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#100:1:G>
We carry we carried uh three hundred percent more Chinese than all that had been brought together by China Airlines Cathay Pacific and C A A C
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#101:1:G>
And surely uh we 've carried more Thais to the Philippines than Thai International
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#102:1:G>
So when we grant these charters we must make sure that these are genuine tourists who are out to visit the country not Filipino workers from abroad
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#103:1:G>
Because these workers our workers abroad are the they belong to the two carriers Philippine Airlines and the carrier of the country from where they originate
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#104:1:G>
We must guard against uh alleged uh charters who say who will say that they will bring uh tourists from the Middle East and yet when you check the loads these are all returning overseas Filipinos or returning <indig> balikbayans </indig> from California or from the U S <O> music </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#105:1:C>
Significant changes in the existing international air transport policies are required including new civil aviation legislation and a more flexible interpretation of existing aviation policy

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#106:1:F>
To begin uh we are opting for the liberalization of the uh approval of inclusive tour air charter uh operations to the Philippines

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#107:1:C>
Okay

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#108:1:F>
Uh secondly we would like to see the opening up of inclusive tour air charter operations to airports outside outside of Manila and and Cebu
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#109:1:F>
Third I think it 's very important that the D O T regain its membership in the Civil <.> Ave </.> Aviation Board or Civil <.> Aero </.> Aeronautics Board

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#110:1:C>
What

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#111:1:F>
The C A B for short
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#112:1:F>
Uh about four years ago we gave up our membership there and uh and in the process we 've realized our uh our uh mistake

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#113:1:C>
Uh-huh

 <$F> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#114:1:F>
Uhm it 's important that uh the voice of tourism be heard in the Civil <.> Aer </.> Aeronautics Board
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#115:1:F>
Uh and lastly uh we believe that uh the Civil Aviation Code needs to be revised
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#116:1:F>
If I 'm not mistaken uh the existing code was drawn up in the early fifties and uh because of changes in uh the the world economy uh the way uh the way travel has developed and the importance today of tourism as uh an economic development tool it 's important that the code be revised to conform to the present uh situation and to anticipate future developments in tourism and travel
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#117:1:F>
Uh today there is uh a House bill that uh attempts to uh revise the Civil Aviation Code 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#118:1:F>
This is House Bill number two two nine nine four and we 're hoping that uh Congress approves this uh before uh before the end of their term <O> music </O> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#119:1:C>
Can Philippine Airlines deliver the tourists that are envisioned to come in droves
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#120:1:C>
Does Philippine Airlines have enough seats enough aircrafts enough flights

 <$G> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-027#121:1:G>
Yes 

 </I>
