<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#3:1>
<it> At the instance of the Executive, the Philippine Congress has
processed the legislation of the reengineering of the bureaucracy.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#4:1>
This reengineering is not simply a reorganization; at its core is the
assertion of a <quote> &ldquo; new paradigm of governance. &ldquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#5:1>
The new paradigm is actually an adoption of the principle of &ldquo;
steering rather than rowing. &ldquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#6:1>
The bone of contention is the interpretation and the contextualization
of <quote> &ldquo; steering rather than rowing. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#7:1>
Current efforts to reengineer the Philippine bureaucracy constitute
attempts at following the global vogue without appreciating specific contexts
and conditions. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#8:1>
The 3Rs - - <foreign> i.e. </foreign> <mention> reinventing,
reengineering, and redefining </mention> - - are the new buzzwords to
describe the intellectual, political, and organizational trends in government
and governance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#9:1>
Osborne and Gaebler 's <mention> <it> Reinventing Government </it>
</mention> , first published in 1993, was some sort of trailblazer though the
authors themselves acknowledge their work was a product and synthesis of the
ideas and experiences of other people. <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#10:1>
The Philippines has jumped into the bandwagon of reinventing
government.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#11:1>
More to the point, the Ramos administration wants to legislate
reinventing and reengineering. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#12:1>
In the House of Representatives, the Committee on Government
Reorganization and the Committee on Appropriations have recommended the
approval of House Bill No. 5671 titled: <mention> &ldquo; An Act to
Reorganize the Executive Departments, Bureaus, Offices, and other
Instrumentalities of the Government, including Government-Owned or Controlled
Corporations. &rdquo; </mention> <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#X13:1>
<quote> &ldquo; In the Senate, similar bills are up for deliberation
at the committee level. <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#X14:1>
All the bills draw heavily from <mention> &ldquo; Re-engineering the
Bureaucracy for Better Governance: Principles and Parameters &rdquo;
</mention> ( PCSB 1995), henceforth called <mention> &ldquo; Reengineering.
&rdquo; </mention> </quote> </X> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#15:1>
<h> <bold> Broadening the Perspective </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#16:1>
From an international perspective, the impetus to reinvent
government or reengineer the public sector is the globalization of capital
and technology and its impact on national economies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#17:1>
Yet, the private sector was the first to reengineer.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#18:1>
After all, the private sector is the most affected by globalization
and heightened competition.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#19:1>
Private corporations, thanks to their natural ability to adapt to
market signals, set in motion the processes of reorganizing and retooling.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#20:1>
This, in turn, increased the demand for Peter Drucker to provide a
new universe for management theory and practice in the era of globalization.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#21:1>
At first blush, the need for the public sector to reinvent and
reengineer in response to globalization was not evident.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#22:1>
To quote Halachmi and Bouckaert ( 1995:323): <O> quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#23:1>
Osborne and Gaebler ( 1993:33) further explain: <O> quotation
</O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#24:1>
From another angle, nation-states have to adjust to the forces
dominant in globalization.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#25:1>
Private finance and transnational corporations have gained the upper
hand in the inexorable globalization process.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#26:1>
A study written by Sarah Anderson and John Cavanagh ( 1996) for the
Institute for Policy Studies, titled <mention> <it> The Top 200 </it>
</mention> , says that private corporations make up the majority of the world 's
top 100 economies. <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#27:1>
Transnational corporations, too, have proven their capability to
subordinate nation-states.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#28:1>
Note, for example, the sensitivity of nation-states ( including the
developed ones) to the volatile movement of international capital.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#29:1>
The Mexican crisis that erupted in December 1994--even as it was
primarily caused by endogenous factors--is nevertheless illustrative of how
global capital can first bring down and then resuscitate a national economy.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#30:1>
The dominance of private capital has likewise led to the
onslaught of privatization.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#31:1>
It is important to stress that the worldwide &ldquo; privatization
movement &rdquo; has triggered a crisis in public administration ( Haque:
1996: 510-36).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#32:1>
Worse, &ldquo; the privatization movement &rdquo; is armed with an
ideology that is anti-public service.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#33:1>
Haque ( 1996: 514) says: <quote> &ldquo; The attack on the public
service has generated both political pressure and economic interest to reduce
its scope and role and reorient its norms and objectives. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#34:1>
Strangely, the globalization factor, including the threat it
brings, is missing from the Philippine initiative to reinvent government and
reengineer the bureaucracy.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#35:1>
The key documents, including <mention> &ldquo; Re-engineering,
&rdquo; </mention> the mother of all documents, as well as the recommended
House Bill ( House Bill No. 5671) and several Senate Bills do not have a word
on the impact of globalization. <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#36:1>
Is this a simple inadvertent omission?

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#37:1>
Or is this a reflection of a narrow, insular perspective? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#38:1>
Whatever it is, it already provides a glimpse of the quality--in
particular, the rigor--of the formulation of the principles and parameters
behind the reengineering effort. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#39:1>
But before delving into that, it is necessary to describe what
the Philippine version of reengineering the bureaucracy is. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#40:1>
<h> <bold> An Introduction to Reengineering the Philippine
Bureaucracy </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#41:1>
The document <mention> &ldquo; Re-engineering &rdquo; </mention>
is first of all an affirmation of <quote> &ldquo; a new paradigm of
governance. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#42:1>
The opening statement of Chapter 1 goes:

<p> <quote> Good government can no longer be achieved simply by working more,
harder, longer, and faster. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#X43:1>
Effective governance can no longer be realized simply by assuming
the main responsibility for all societal concerns.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#X44:1>
Efficient government administration can no longer be maintained
simply by correcting the superficial symptoms of a dysfunctioning bureaucracy
</quote> ( PCSB 1995:1). </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#45:1>
With that as premise, <mention> &ldquo; Re-engineering &rdquo;
</mention> puts forward a new set of principles of governance, namely: ( 1)
frugality and prioritization, ( 2) steering, and ( 3) compartmentalization (
PCSB 1995: 2-18).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#46:1>
From these principles flow the definition and explanation of the
following:

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#47:1>
- Government 's main responsibilities

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#48:1>
- Government 's relationship with the private sector

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#49:1>
- Government intervention and regulation

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#50:1>
- Provision of public goods

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#51:1>
- Distribution of functions among levels of government

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#52:1>
- Administrative structural framework </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#53:1>
Although the reorganization of the bureaucracy, specifically the
executive branch, is the ultimate objective, the most problematic issues
revolve around the espousal of a new philosophy, or what <mention> &ldquo;
Re-engineering &rdquo; </mention> calls a new vision, a new paradigm of
governance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#54:1>
Professor Ma. Concepcion P. Alfiler of the UP College of Public
Administration has noted that what makes the proposed reengineering law
qualitatively different from past reorganization laws is that the former
advances a fundamental philosophy. <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#55:1>
The heart of the issue--or shall we say the controversy--is the
philosophy itself together with the ambiguity of the terms and parameters.
<fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#56:1>
In this regard, the reorganization of the bureaucracy <foreign>
per se </foreign> is not a problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#57:1>
The government invariably has to respond to changing social, economic
and political conditions both on the national and international fronts.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#58:1>
Along this line, to quote Root ( 1995: 9), <quote> [ g]ood policies
by themselves are insufficient if doubts about the quality of public sector
management undermine social support for the policies. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#59:1>
In other words, to capably address the new conditions, the reform of
administrative systems, including reorganization, is necessary. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#60:1>
<h> <bold> Immediate Relevance of Reengineering </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#61:1>
Off the bat, one can cite a number of internal and external
factors that make reorganization at this time relevant: the decentralization
of power and devolution of services, the rise of credible nongovernmental
organizations ( NGOs) and civil society institutions, the increasing demand
for public goods amid the low tax collection effort, the information
revolution, the integration of regional economies, and globalization itself.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#62:1>
Government reorganization has occurred five times in the
post-independence period, an average of one reorganization every eight years
( Cola 1993:382).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#63:1>
The last reorganization took effect a decade ago, during the
transition period of Aquino 's revolutionary government. <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp>
</fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#64:1>
Furthermore, the ostensible goals of reorganization in 1946,
1950, 1954, 1968, and 1986 are more or less the same: economy and efficiency
and at times, simplicity and effectiveness ( Cola 1993: 385).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#65:1>
A variable goal common in the 1968 and 1986 reorganization is to
attune the bureaucracy to economic and social development ( Cola 1993: 385).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#66:1>
The goals of the new restructuring proposal--now pending in
Congress--are no different from the above though with a different context.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#67:1>
That the reengineering program is seeking legislation is likewise
regular.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#68:1>
Cola ( 1993: 383) states that the requirements for reorganization
<quote> &ldquo; are provided through an enabling act which also defines the
work that the reorganization must accomplish. &ldquo; </quote> <fnr> <sp> 8
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#69:1>
In consonance with this, the Department of Budget and Management has
opined that the power to reorganize is legislative unless delegated. <sp> 9
</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#70:1>
In a word, the proposed reorganization ( or reengineering)
program is nothing extraordinary, if not for its philosophy and <quote>
&ldquo; new paradigm of governance. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#71:1>
The significance then of passing a law on reengineering the
bureaucracy is:

<p> <quote> In the absence of a law which enshrines the Principles of
Governance and identifies the power, scope, functions, and organization of
government, there will be no philosophical basis for future reorganization
and streamlining efforts </quote> ( PCSB n.d.: 26). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#72:1>
<h> <bold> The Problem of Defining the Philosophy </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#73:1>
The philosophy of this new reengineering program borrows
substantially from Osborne and Gaebler 's <mention> <it> Reinventing
Government </it> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#74:1>
Osborne and Gaebler ( 1993:25) define catalytic government as <quote>
&ldquo; steering rather than rowing." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#75:1>
A central message of <mention> &ldquo; Re-engineering &rdquo;
</mention> ( PCSB 1995: 5) is thus: <quote> &ldquo; The role of the national
government in the sectors shall be to steer rather than to row." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#76:1>
The bills in Congress say the same thing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#77:1>
House Bill No. 5671 states: <quote> &ldquo; The proper role of
government in the various sectors shall be on steering and mobilizing the
instruments that contribute to achieving sectoral objectives. &rdquo;
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#78:1>
The Shahani Bill ( S. B. No. 1374) says: <quote> &ldquo; The role of
the national government in the sectors shall be to steer rather than to row.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#79:1>
In the Ople Bill ( S.B. No. 636), <quote> &ldquo; The proper role of
government in the various sectors shall be steering and mobilizing the
instruments that contribute in the achievement of sectoral objectives.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#80:1>
The principle of steering is unquestionable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#81:1>
The problem with Philippine reengineering, however, is found in the
interpretation, contextualization, and application of the principle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#82:1>
One must note that the formulations of Osborne and Gaebler possess
significant nuances, contexts, and qualifications ( Sta. Ana 1996: 3). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#83:1>
In elaborating the principle of steering, <mention> &ldquo;
Re-engineering &rdquo; </mention> defines the government relationship with
the private sector ( PCSB 1995:6):

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#84:1>
a) Government will strive to let the market operate by itself.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#85:1>
It will establish a stable policy environment, set minimum and
appropriate rules and provide information, rather than directly engage in the
provision and production of goods and services;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#86:1>
b) The private sector will be encouraged to share, to the extent
possible, in the responsibility and the cost of the provision of public goods
and services;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#87:1>
c) The private sector will assume the primary responsibility for the
production of public goods and services. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#88:1>
The Bills in Congress echo the same line.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#89:1>
House Bill No. 5671 declares: <quote> &ldquo; To the extent possible,
government shall limit direct provision and productions ( sic) of public
goods and encourage more private sector participation. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#90:1>
The Shahani Bill ( S.B. No. 1374), arguably the more comprehensive
and elaborative bill in the Senate, states under the rubric of the principle
of steering: <quote> &ldquo; The government shall, to the extent possible,
assume an indirect role in the sectors, intervening through market
mechanisms. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#X91:1>
It shall likewise find ways to create conditions to stimulate more
private sector participation. &rdquo; </X> </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#92:1>
Uncannily, the Drilon Bill ( S.B. No. 1111) contains the same words
and phrases used by Shahani ( or is it the other way around?): <quote>
&ldquo; the State shall [ a]ssume an indirect role in the sectors,
intervening through market mechanisms creating thereby conditions to
stimulate more private sectoral participations ( sic). &rdquo; </quote> </p>
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#93:1>
How government defines its relationship with the private sector--as
enumerated above--is in a manner tantamount to subordinating government to
the market and the private sector.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#94:1>
Nowhere in <mention> <it> Reinventing Government </it> </mention> can
one find a statement agreeing <quote> &ldquo; to let the market operate by
itself" </quote> or let the private sector <quote> &ldquo; assume the primary
responsibility for the production of public goods and services." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#95:1>
On the contrary, Osborne and Gaebler ( 1993:35) stress: <O>
quotation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#96:1>
In other words, <mention> <it> Reinventing Government </it>
</mention> ( Osborne and Gaebler 1993:35-37) prefers <quote> &ldquo; steering
organizations that shop around" </quote> for multiple service providers, <it>
including the public sector </it> , to promote comprehensive solutions,
specialization, flexibility, experimentation, and accountability.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#97:1>
Steering is separated from rowing in order that the people involved
in policymaking can focus on developing holistic, comprehensive strategies
and mobilizing &ldquo; many different oarsmen ( oarspeople?), &rdquo;
composed of nongovernment and government personnel, to carry out the
strategies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#98:1>
To put it another way, <mention> <it> Reinventing Government
</it> </mention> dismisses the idea that <quote> &ldquo; government cannot
compete with business. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#99:1>
Further: <quote> &ldquo; Not only can it compete, it can win."
</quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#100:1>
In identifying the types of competition, it includes &ldquo; public
versus private competition &rdquo; and &ldquo; public versus public
competition. &rdquo;

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#101:1>
It likewise dwells on government agencies competing for internal
government services ( Osborne and Gaebler 1993:84-92). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#102:1>
All this, to be sure, does not in any way indicate that <quote>
&ldquo; the private sector will assume the primary responsibility for the
production of goods and services." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#103:1>
Neither does it suggest that government <quote> &ldquo; shall limit
the direct provision of goods" </quote> and <quote> &ldquo; assume an
indirect role in the sectors. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#104:1>
Furthermore, while <mention> <it> Reinventing Government </it>
</mention> advocates a market-oriented government, it frowns on <quote>
&ldquo; letting the market operate by itself" </quote> ( Osborne and Gaebler
1993: 282-84).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#105:1>
The key is for governments to <quote> &ldquo; use their immense <it>
leverage </it> to structure the market." </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#106:1>
Osborne and Gaebler clarify this <it> <quote> &ldquo; has nothing to
do with conservative calls to 'leave it to the market,' </it> however. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#X107:1>
<it> Structuring the market to achieve a public purpose is in fact
the opposite of leaving matters to the 'free market' </it> ( italics
mine)--it is a form of <it> intervention </it> in the market. &rdquo; </X>
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#108:1>
In a word then, even if the current Philippine version of
reengineering the bureaucracy adopts in words the progressive principle of
steering, it does not give justice to the substance of the principle.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-019#109:1>
In fact, it distorts the meaning of the principle. </p> </I>
