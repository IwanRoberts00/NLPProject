Subject: <h> Important: Non-billable Mandays Policy in Effect </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#7:1>
Hi all,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#8:1>
This is to remind everyone that the non-billable mandays policy is
now in effect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#9:1>
Please make sure that all projects with days falling under any of
the five categories in the policy have approvals from the right management
levels, and that the register for non-billable mandays in DMS is updated
accordingly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#10:1>
To repeat, these categories are:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#11:1>
a. Work-at-risk

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#12:1>
b. Unfunded &ldquo; referenceability &rdquo; projects

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#13:1>
c. Project Overruns

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#14:1>
d. Internal projects

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#15:1>
e. Free prototypes </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#16:1>
During the recent financial year-end reviews, some projects were
found to be work-at-risk.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#17:1>
Unless the status has changed, we expect that these projects now have
approvals or pending requests for approval.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#18:1>
We are also aware of significant overruns in fixed price projects
that also require approval. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#19:1>
Thank you for your usual support and cooperation. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#20:1>
Regards,

Subject: <h> URGENT: PPR Summary Sheet Needed by Division </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#27:2>
Hi all,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#28:2>
PSCentre has mandated that all PPRs be accompanied by a summary
sheet that will be standard across the division.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#29:2>
This is of similar format to the summary currently being prepared by
the PSCentre. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#30:2>
In order for our Project Managers to comply with the request
which will be required henceforth with the monthly submission, the region 's
deadline for this month 's PPRs has been moved from Monday, December 4 to
Friday, December 8. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#31:2>
I have attached a document with the summary for all the projects
currently being reported by South Asia to the division, as extracted from the
October PSCentre report.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#32:2>
Please get your country 's projects and distribute as needed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#33:2>
All your PMs need to do is to update their project with progress for
November, and then to make sure that all required metrics are supplied. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#34:2>
This summary sheet is to be appended to the External and Internal
PPRs as the last sheet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#35:2>
Basically, the updates needed will be:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#36:2>
a. project assessment ( color) for the current period and the last
period

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#37:2>
b. progress for the current period

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#38:2>
c. Key issues ( about 3-5) for the project.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#39:2>
Please indicate any payment issues ( <foreign> i.e. </foreign> , if
any invoices outstanding for over 90 days) in this section.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#40:2>
d. Key metrics defined as follows:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#41:2>
<h> <it> Percent complete % </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#42:2>
This is the total number of mandays expended on the project from
project Start to the end of the current month ( = actual to date) divided by
the Current estimated total days for the entire project. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#43:2>
<h> <it> Approved days </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#44:2>
This is the number of days that would have been approved by
bidapp or the practice as the total estimated days for the project (
inclusive of contingency) at the time we started plus any approved change
request mandays that the client will pay for. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#45:2>
<h> <it> Current Plan Days </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#46:2>
This is, as of the current plan, how many total days the project
is forecast to take.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#47:2>
This will give a good indication of any slippage in the project and
possible missed milestones. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#48:2>
<h> <it> Actual Days to Date </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#49:2>
Number of days recorded against this project from start until and
Including the current month. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#50:2>
<h> <it> Budget Margin % </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#51:2>
The approved margin % for the project. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#52:2>
<h> <it> Forecast margin % </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#53:2>
Our current best estimate of the total margin for the entire
project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#54:2>
Once again, the deadline will be Friday, December 8.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#55:2>
This summary sheet is to follow the client and internal PPRs as the
last page in the same Word file for the project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#56:2>
For compliance please.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#57:2>
Thank you. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#58:2>

Subject: <h> Raising the Bar: PPRs </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#66:3>
Hi all,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#67:3>
Majority of the PPRs in the region obtained a GREEN rating for
PPR quality last month, and I would like to commend all the PMs and
Operations Managers on your efforts to achieve this.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#68:3>
( The rating of all December PPRs in the region will be published to
all of you this Friday, after a review of any requests for reconsideration.)
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#69:3>
What this shows is that we all now know how to fill in the
template, where to get our figures, how to document project progress,
<foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#70:3>
We have all displayed the discipline required to get all of these
accomplished before the deadline, including having a PPR meeting.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#71:3>
This is a great achievement, and we should all be proud.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#72:3>
But it should not stop us from striving to hit a higher goal:
achieving a BLUE rating. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#73:3>
How then do we now move from a GREEN to a BLUE?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#74:3>
The answer to this question directly relates to your answer to this
question:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#75:3>
<quote> &ldquo; If a healthcheck were to be done today on your
project, would any risk or issue be uncovered that is not written somewhere
in your PPR, whether external or internal?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#76:3>
And would you have written down some mitigation or plan for
resolution of the same?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#77:3>
Would the healthchecker recommend that you raise a Change Request
immediately for something? &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#78:3>
If your answer to all of the above questions is NO, then your PPR
probably can qualify for a BLUE rating.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#79:3>
If your answer to any of the above is YES, then you need to improve
not just how you write your PPR, but maybe even how you are managing your
project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#80:3>
If you are an Operations Manager or a PM SLL, and one of your PMs
answered YES to the above, then your PPR meetings are not as effective as
they should be. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#81:3>
The PPR needs to reflect not just the current status of the
project; it also needs to show that you as PM are fully in control of your
project.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#82:3>
You are managing not just the deliverables, resources and financials,
but you are also managing the risks and issues in the project.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#83:3>
Going a step further, you see the opportunities for additional
business with the client, and are able to maximize these opportunities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#84:3>
The section on Issues and Problems should contain not just
product problems and TARs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#85:3>
More importantly, it needs to contain project risks and issues that
may or are already impacting project success.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#86:3>
Change Requests should be raised not just for matters that entail an
increase in mandays or costs - - PMs need to be conscious of any change that
is significant: client delays or initiatives that will affect schedules, CRs
that will impact cash flow, data problems that can cause delays, <foreign>
etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#87:3>
These Change Requests can be raised against the client, against
another LOB, or even against the practice.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#88:3>
And as you all know, having an external and internal PPR gives us the
opportunity to raise sensitive issues/risks/matters internally - - and these
are matters that we can bring up for discussion and escalation during the
monthly PPR meetings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#89:3>
So next time you write a PPR, look at your project with the eyes
of a healthchecker, and write down what you see.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#90:3>
And hopefully the person who will read your PPR will see BLUE. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#91:3>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#92:3>

This headcount had been previously approved and a candidate
hired ( yyyyy yyyyyyy).

As you know, this headcount is urgently needed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#104:4>
Given the current hiring restrictions, I hope you can help us get
the necessary approvals to get xxxxxxxxxxx on board.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#105:4>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#117:5>
It would be good if you could get a better understanding of &ldquo;
how we do things &rdquo; and perhaps we can also come up with suggestions on
better ways of doing things, from lessons learned in the past ( inside or
outside Oracle). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#137:6>
Hi Marie,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#138:6>
We had our meeting with Peter Cooper and the South Asia PDs
yesterday, and I had some time to present to them our training plans as well
as a brief section on the OU initiatives this year.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#139:6>
I think it was a good discussion, as we reached decisions going
forward.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#140:6>
The presentation you gave Steve and myself a few weeks back really
helped a great deal in concretizing what we had to do ( thanks again). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#141:6>
Basically, we are proceeding with getting our training
requirements in two ways:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#142:6>
<h> a. Bottom Up </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#143:6>
1. PDs have been given a deadline of end-July to finish the
OPAS/Training Development Plans for all their staff.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#144:6>
2. Staff will have till end-July to enter these Training Plans into
OUWeb ( as future demand deposit), as agreed in their OPAS session.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#145:6>
3. Staff also have to update their Training Histories by end-July.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#146:6>
<h> b. Top Down </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#147:6>
1. RPD to appoint all SLLs on a full-time basis by this month.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#148:6>
2. These SLLs will coordinate with the divisional and global SLLs on
PRP demands.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#149:6>
They will also coordinate with country SLLs on special requirements.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#150:6>
3. RPD to provide major focus areas ( business plans) and
communicate to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#151:6>
4. PDs and SLLs to communicate any special training needs to me
based on their own business plans and the PRP process, if these have not been
filtered down to the consultant demand deposit level yet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#152:6>
Some agreements:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#153:6>
1. We will fully utilize the OUWeb features and facilities.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#154:6>
2. All courses will now go through OUWeb: registrations,
cancellations, costing, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#155:6>
Demand will also be derived from OUWeb.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#156:6>
3. Ownership of the training responsibility must be the individual 's,
and this message must be constantly communicated.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#157:6>
4. The country SLLs will track accomplishment of training plans.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#158:6>
5. The country PDs will follow up the status of Learning Labs in
their subs.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#159:6>
6. I will serve as the primary contact person with OU. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#160:6>
I need your assistance in the following areas ( please direct me
to the right person to liaise with):

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#161:6>
1. How to find out what standard reports are available and how we
can have some new reports developed in case we have any special requirements
( best if we can do it ourselves).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#162:6>
Is self-service reporting already available? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#163:6>
We need the reports by end-July to monitor compliance with our
deadlines as well as to provide feedback to the PDs on our training profile.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#164:6>
And of course, we would hope we can get decision support info as
well on a continuing basis through these reports. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#165:6>
2. In case we need to post a training demand but have not
identified the attendees yet, is there a way to post this onto OUWeb through
using say, a &ldquo; dummy &rdquo; name/s?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#166:6>
We would want this demand to be consolidated with the individual
future demand deposits of our staff. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#167:6>
In addition, we feel strongly as a group that the policy on
replacements should be revised.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#168:6>
We accept that cancellations with less than 10 working days notice
should incur penalties, but replacements from the same practice must be
allowed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#169:6>
We feel that replacements can be done without sacrificing the
quality of attendees, as we now have enough consultants in all our practices
to do this.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#170:6>
Please reconsider. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#171:6>
By the way, I will be in Singapore again next week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#172:6>
If you are there Wednesday afternoon ( July 12), it would be good to
meet with you again. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-021#173:6>
