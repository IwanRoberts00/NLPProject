<h> <bold> Filipino Women: Transcending Their Marginalization in
History </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#3:1>
History possesses the power of giving importance to persons by
chronicling their accomplishments.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#4:1>
It also possesses the power of burying them in oblivion or
non-existence.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#5:1>
Because Philippine history has been recorded by Filipino males based
on archival documents left by Spanish friars ( also males), two ways
relegated women to the corners of non-recognition - - the perspective of
foreigners and the male viewpoint. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#6:1>
However, power is not only in patriarchy or in the history that
men write.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#7:1>
Power is also possessed by women in history or &ldquo; herstory
&rdquo; although they have been excluded from the process of writing it.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#8:1>
What is needed is to resurface women 's accomplishments in history so
that their people can be made aware of these, and therefore return to them
their lost identity as persons equal to men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#9:1>
This paper aims to give its readers a knowledge of women in
development, from &ldquo; our perspective of history &rdquo; as translated
from Salazar 's <indig> <it> pantayong pananaw sa kasaysayan </it> </indig> (
mimeographed, n.d.).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#10:1>
This is the mentality in Filipino culture and society which is
different from that of foreigners.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#11:1>
However, in this paper, the emphasis is not on the writings of
Filipino and foreign male historians on Filipino women, but that of female
Filipino historians on &ldquo; herstory".

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#12:1>
It will review the literature and see how these women writers
demystify the myths about women ingrained in the history books and articles
written by men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#13:1>
Demystifying accepted beliefs and social constructs, like gender
roles, is a part of the structural analytical method of Barthes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#14:1>
According to him, the role of myth in an industrialized society is
naturally governed by the struggle of classes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#15:1>
These myths promote the interests of the bourgeois class, and
therefore are a part of the structural power of classes in capitalist
societies ( Fiske, 1987: 145). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#16:1>
History books have narratives created by Filipinos based on the
writings of foreign male historians from their own Western and dominating
perspective.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#17:1>
Therefore, Filipinos should not accept these books at their face
value but from a native perspective or from a self-perspective ( <indig> <it>
pantayong pananaw </it> </indig> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#18:1>
Women experts from different disciplines of the social sciences have
taken the initiative to rewrite the history of Filipino women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#19:1>
It is this rewriting that this paper aims to look at and review to
arrive at the unmasked realities of the role of Filipino women in development
which is ignored in Philippine history.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#20:1>
We shall see how these women experts resurface and demystify these
myths in history books, and how readers can become aware of how women are
marginalized in our society.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#21:1>
This paper will analyze these unmasked myths by taking from the
writings the binary oppositions of the Western perspective dominating these
history books. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#22:1>
In the realm of the abstract, there are binary oppositions in the
Western view of gender roles, such as the assigning of the workplace as the
exclusive domain of men and the relegation of women to work within the house.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#23:1>
From these oppositions, we can see the difference in valuation of men 's
role <foreign> vis-&agrave;-vis </foreign> that of women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#24:1>
The male standard is also used in assigning values to women 's work,
such as the importance given to women as organizers or active members of
social organizations or during the revolution or war.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#25:1>
These are social myths constructed by the <foreign> androgenic
</foreign> patriarchal society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#26:1>
This paper will relate the development of power of Filipino women
from her being of equal status to men in the pre-colonial period, to the
lowering of her status in the Spanish times.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#27:1>
It shall also trace her struggles from the past to the present to
obtain equality with and recognition from men in our society. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#28:1>
<h> <bold> Equality </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#29:1>
Women before the advent of the Spaniards in the Philippines
enjoyed a high position in society.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#30:1>
They were called <mention> <indig> <it> babaylans </it> </indig>
</mention> in the Visayas, <mention> <indig> <it> catalonans </it> </indig>
</mention> by the Tagalogs, <mention> <indig> <it> doronakit </it> </indig>
</mention> by the Isnegs, <mention> <indig> <it> mangaalisig </it> </indig>
</mention> by the Kalingas, <mention> <indig> <it> manganito </it> </indig>
</mention> in Pangasinan, <mention> <indig> <it> baliana </it> </indig>
</mention> in Bicol, <mention> <indig> <it> mabalian </it> </indig>
</mention> by the Bagobos, <mention> <indig> <it> almonos </it> </indig>
</mention> by the B'laans, and <mention> <indig> <it> aniteras </it> </indig>
</mention> by the Gaddangs.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#31:1>
They were the &ldquo; spirit mediums &rdquo; who presided over
animistic religious ceremonies and rituals of devotion to the <indig> <it>
anitos </it> </indig> , the wooden images representing dead ancestors who
were intermediaries to their god, <indig> <it> Bathala </it> </indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#32:1>
Their elevated status in society was evident in their other functions
of counselling, even by the <indig> <it> datu </it> </indig> , the head of
the tribe, and of healing ( Honculada, 1987).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#33:1>
The power of women in the religious realm was evident from the way
male <indig> <it> babaylans </it> </indig> copied their long dresses when the
latter exercised their role as priestesses ( Ribadeneyra, 1947:52).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#34:1>
Male <indig> <it> babaylans </it> </indig> were called <mention>
<indig> <it> asog </it> </indig> </mention> ( Magos, 1990:5), which in
contemporary usage in the Aklanon language of Aklan would mean &ldquo;
tomboy".

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#35:1>
The point of references is the female gender and not the male one (
Geremia, 1993:2). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#36:1>
The distinctive social position of women was also discovered by
Spanish missionaries when they docked at Cebu.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#37:1>
According to a male historian, women, like men, can be daughters of
the <indig> <it> maharlika </it> </indig> , the local nobility or royalty.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#38:1>
The royal consort in Cebu when they came was Queen Juana ( Morga,
1958:294; Infante, 1969:152).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#39:1>
Another one mentioned was Queen Sima, but what was peculiar among
these women was that they were old or incapable of having children, which is
why society regarded them highly.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#40:1>
The myth is evident here that a single, childless woman is more
entitled to homage and respect than a mother tied to her husband. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#41:1>
Also mentioned in history books is the story of the life of
Princess Urduja of Pangasinan.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#42:1>
She is the one referred to as the <mention> <quote> beautiful amazon
</quote> </mention> , <quote> &ldquo; brave and knowledgeable in the culture
and language of Old Asia, skilled in weaponry and leader of an army of women
who fought like men. &rdquo; </quote> Although it was the expertise of a
woman-in-battle that is being admired in this case, the point of reference is
again the man-in-battle - - another contemporary social myth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#43:1>
Warfare is still considered part of &ldquo; man 's world &rdquo;
which cannot be penetrated by women, if they don't want to be called
<mention> &ldquo; amazons. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#44:1>
Evident in this is the value men place on their exclusive world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#45:1>
Although the contemporary historians cited here give women an
elevated role in society, their observations were obviously focused on the
period prior to the coming of the Spaniards.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#46:1>
This was the topic of Camagay in her research on books by historians
such as the <mention> <it> History of the Filipino People </it> </mention> of
Agoncillo and Guerrero.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#47:1>
The short sentences cited in this book say <quote> &ldquo; men and
women were equal, &rdquo; </quote> <quote> &ldquo; women had the right to be
heads of <indig> barangay </indig> , not to use their husband 's name, and
seek their own property without the husband 's permission &rdquo; </quote> (
Camagay, 1987:8). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#48:1>
These male historians perpetuate the myth that politics and
economics were not for women, and even if they enjoyed such conditions, it
was not significant because it was contrary to the philosophical line of the
male-dominated capitalist society. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#49:1>
<h> <bold> Inequality </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#50:1>
The history books about the Spanish period were written by friars
who manifested, even at the start, their low esteem for Filipino women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#51:1>
This is evident in this citation from a Spanish friar on the
Filipina: <X> <quote> &ldquo; ...woman is the most monstrous animal in the
whole nature, bad-tempered and worse-spoken.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#X52:1>
To have this animal in the house is asking for trouble...

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#X53:1>
for wherever a [ wo]man is, it would seem impossible to have peace
and quiet.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#X54:1>
However, even this might be tolerated if it was not for the danger
of unchastity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#X55:1>
Not only should the parish priest of <indig> <it> indios </it>
</indig> abstain from employing women in his house, he should not allow them
to enter it, even if they are paying a call... &rdquo; </quote> </X> ( Dias,
in Mananzan, 1987:20). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#56:1>
From this we can gather that the Spanish colonizers marginalize
the female gender.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#57:1>
We can say that because women were the spiritual and cultural leaders
in their communities, the Spaniards envied them and stripped them of their
roles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#58:1>
A noted historian says, <quote> &ldquo; Spanish conquerors conspired
with the friars in their colonization of the natives, which is why the
<indig> <it> babaylan </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> catalonan </it> </indig>
, <indig> <it> anitera </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> doronaki </it> </indig>
, etc. were left without roles in religious rites, beliefs, and lifestyle of
native communities &rdquo; </quote> ( Salazar, 1989, cited by Santiago,
1992:18).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#59:1>
This was also what Landa Jocano referred to as <quote> &ldquo;
duplication of tasks &rdquo; </quote> ( <foreign> ibid. </foreign> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#60:1>
Santiago clarified that the feminist movement in history and the
women 's movement inside the <indig> Katipunan </indig> both showed the true
roles of the Filipina in the revolution.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#61:1>
Historians, in mentioning women only in relation to the men in their
lives, propagate the myth of identifying women relatively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#62:1>
Thus, Teodora Alonzo was known as the mother of Dr. Jose Rizal,
Josefa Gabriela Silang as the wife of Diego Silang, and Gregoria de Jesus as
the wife of Andres Bonifacio ( Mangahas, 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#63:1>
Their own contributions to the independence movement have been given
no greater importance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#64:1>
Santiago also looked at the women 's movement in the <indig>
Katipunan </indig> through the analysis of books and articles about the lives
of the women members, such as the autobiography and two poems written by
Gregoria de Jesus ( <indig> Ka </indig> Oriang).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#65:1>
She learned that there was a <indig> Katipunan </indig> branch for
women even before Gregoria de Jesus became one of its members.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#66:1>
The leadership of the organization included Josefa Rizal ( Rizal 's
sister), president; Gregoria de Jesus, vice president and <indig> Lakambini
</indig> ; Maria Dizon-Santiago, secretary; and Angelica Rizal Lopez, fiscal
( Cruz, 1989, Santiago:13).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#67:1>
However, there were no documents to substantiate achievements of
Josefa Rizal as head of the women 's branch of the <indig> Katipunan </indig>
, but one can see from this hierarchy that Josefa 's position was more
significant than Gregoria 's or <indig> Ka </indig> Oriang 's.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#68:1>
Santiago said that despite being the <indig> Katipunan </indig>
<foreign> Supremo </foreign> 's wife, she was named only vice president and
not president. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#69:1>
But <indig> Ka </indig> Oriang showed her courage and dedication
to women 's rights when she herself defended in the revolutionary court her
claim on the attempted rape she suffered in the hands of the Magdalo camp.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#70:1>
She refused to accept the term <mention> &ldquo; raped &rdquo;
</mention> in describing what happened to her, but insisted that an attempt
to do so was made.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#71:1>
In Santiago 's interpretation, <quote> &ldquo; she did not believe
that her honor was lost in this process, instead, she stood for the right of
the woman, the right for defense, the right for the woman 's control of her
body and mind in the face of conflicting forces inside a struggle &rdquo;
</quote> ( Santiago:15). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#72:1>
Santiago mentioned that more activities were participated in by
women in the revolution, and such would have been reported if only the women
themselves had a voice in forming its historiography.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#73:1>
One thing which should be given attention in her report is the event
in 1889 when twenty women of Malolos petitioned Governor General Weyler of
the Spanish government to open an Academy of the Spanish Language that would
admit women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#74:1>
In Santiago 's view it was a very important point in the history of
the feminist movement in the country ( 19). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#75:1>
Santiago has disproved the myth that the role of the so-called
<foreign> <it> mujer indigena </it> </foreign> ( native woman) in society is
to be a housewife, embroiderer, nurse to care for children, supporter and
extension of men, and that she has no voice in the formulation of programs
and policies, planning of strategies in a political campaign and in
management or administrative work in the public domain ( 15-16).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#76:1>
According to the secretary of the women 's branch of the <indig>
Katipunan </indig> , Marina Dizon-Santiago, the women served as <quote>
&ldquo; guards at the meetings, spies for the acts of the Spanish soldiers,
recorders of decisions/agreements made in a meeting, keepers of important
documents, designers and markers of flags, apart from being servers of coffee
and food, etc. &rdquo; </quote> ( 16). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#77:1>
She also dismissed the myth of the privilege to study and work
outside the home, which was then for men only.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#78:1>
She stressed that there was a feminist movement in the 19th century
as determined by two important factors: <quote> &ldquo; first, the
mushrooming of factories that used labor force that utilized mostly women
workers, i.e., the tobacco, textile and cloth factories; and second, the long
periods of suppression of women, most especially in the field of education,
that had imprinted a latent hatred, for deep in their consciousness, they
remember their important role in the previous society &rdquo; </quote> (
Santiago:18). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#79:1>
<h> <bold> Relative Freedom </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#80:1>
The American period had provided relative freedom for Filipino
women.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#81:1>
Since free education had been popularized from the first grade to
high school, young girls, rich or poor, were now allowed to study as their
brothers did.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#82:1>
The much-harped-on rationale of insufficient money for education and
that only men could be educated was no longer true.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#83:1>
Another myth was disproved - - that men are more intelligent than
women, and because of this, they are the only ones who study, since women
need no education when they marry and remain in the house. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#84:1>
Since 1900, night classes were opened in colleges to give an
opportunity to working students to be able to finish and serve the country
and especially the government.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#85:1>
Gender did not become a hindrance here.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#86:1>
One more thing that helped women was the system of <foreign> <it>
pensionados </it> </foreign> ( scholars) opened for them in 1905.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#87:1>
In this system, promising youths were given scholarships to study
abroad and serve their country afterwards.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#88:1>
Like the men, women were chosen through an examination ( Martinez,
1987:66).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#89:1>
Because of these benefits, women were able to take a great leap
forward towards growth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#90:1>
They now aspired for greater participation in society, including the
right to vote. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#91:1>
In the first election of 1907 for the National Congress, it was
only the propertied and educated men who could vote.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#92:1>
This demonstrated the myth that even then, although women could
study, they were just trained as aides to men at home, and not in the field
of politics.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#93:1>
In 1935, women were yet to be included in the electorate which was
limited to educated men 21 and above. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#94:1>
As early as 1903, the <foreign> <it> Asociacion Feminista
Filipina </it> </foreign> has been formed by a group of prominent women
promoting only their participation in social services and assigning women to
voting precincts and municipal and provincial councils of education.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#95:1>
Thus, the myth that the home is a woman 's world still prevailed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#96:1>
The American suffragettes in 1912 brought about the establishment of
what was to become the National Federation of Women 's Clubs of the
Philippines.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#97:1>
The women 's suffrage movement spread during that period, spearheaded
by female college graduates.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#98:1>
The movement was a success and obtained for them their right to vote
in 1937, two years after the 1935 Constitution was ratified.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#99:1>
They proved wrong the myth of non-participation of women in politics
and neglect of their education on matters outside the home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#100:1>
But this promising start of the feminist movement in political
participation was not followed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#101:1>
The members of the NFWC came from the higher class and their
objectives tended to preserve the myth circulated by capitalist society that
women should stay at home.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#102:1>
Their projects promoted more the traditional obligations of women
like nurturing children, mothercraft, and protection of consumers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#103:1>
The opportunities given to women were achieved only because they
had been asked for forcibly and were not given freely.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-016#104:1>
It was tantamount to giving a favor to a younger sister or relative
and not to an equal. </p> </I>
