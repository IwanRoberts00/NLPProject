<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#14:1>
<h> STRATEGY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#15:1>
BOC 's strategic thrusts are:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#16:1>
<h> Revenue generation: </h> collect targeted revenues through
improved collection efficiency and plugging of revenue leakages;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#17:1>
<h> Trade facilitation: </h> support government programs through
speedy clearing of goods and passengers from Customs;

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#18:1>
<h> Intelligence and enforcement: </h> protect society against
prohibited drugs and other harmful substances, and illegal trade of natural
resources; and

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#19:1>
<h> Internal administration of bureau resources: </h> support the
government 's thrust to streamline the bureaucracy and to employ resources
more effectively. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#20:1>
<h> ORGANIZATION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#21:1>
BOC is headed by the Customs Commissioner.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#22:1>
He is assisted by five Deputy Commissioners and fourteen District
Collectors who supervise the different departments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#23:1>
<h> Internal Administration Group. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#24:1>
Under a Deputy Commissioner, this group assists the Commissioner in
the formulation of policies and in the setting up of objectives relative to
financial, administrative, personnel, planning and management improvement
services of the BOC; represents the Commissioner in meetings and conferences;
signs memorandum circulars; and reviews official communications and documents
relevant to internal administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#25:1>
<h> Revenue Collection Monitoring Group. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#26:1>
Under a Deputy Commissioner, this group maintains an accounting of
revenues collected; administers the legal requirements of the BOC; provides
information and analysis of collection statistics; and audits liquidated
entries and bonds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#27:1>
<h> Assessment and Operations Coordination Group </h> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#28:1>
Under a Deputy Commissioner, this group gathers and publishes of
values of commodities imported into the country; and monitors implementation
of rules and regulations governing assessment, end processing of goods for
exports, warehousing and support operations, and auction and disposal
activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#29:1>
<h> Intelligence and Enforcement Group. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#30:1>
Under a Deputy Commissioner, this group gathers intelligence
information related to Customs and economic activities; conducts internal
inquiry and investigation; and exercises police authority. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#31:1>
<h> Management Information System and Technology Group ( MISTG).
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#32:1>
To ensure its continuing progress, the implementation of BOC 's
computerization program necessitated the creation of MISTG on January 9, 1998
under Executive Order No. 463.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#33:1>
The need for the creation of a greatly expanded IT group was already
reflected in the 1992 ISP as a support to the aim for BOC to assume direct
management and control of IT facilities and services after the conclusion of
the transitional facilities management arrangements under the PTCP contract.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#34:1>
MISTG is headed by a Deputy Commissioner who is responsible for
overall supervision of the different operating units. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#35:1>
<h> Collection Districts. </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#36:1>
Each District is headed by a District Collector of Customs and
collects duties, taxes and other charges accruing to the government;
exercises police powers; supervises the entrance and clearance of vessels
engaged in commerce; supervises and controls handling of foreign mail; and
supervises all import and export cargoes and freight stations. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#37:1>
<h> OPERATIONAL PLANS / TACTICS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#38:1>
The Bureau conceptualized the SPACE Program as early as 1998 to
implement a Cargo Clearance Procedure that will meet the requirements of the
21st century.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#39:1>
SPACE stands for the five general principles underlying the
progressive clearance procedure.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#40:1>
Specifically, it means:

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#41:1>
<h> Selectivity: </h> only high-risk shipments will undergo the
regular clearance process while majority will be given express processing

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#42:1>
<h> Post Audit: </h> shipments given express clearance maybe
subjected to post audit or some form of release clearance process

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#43:1>
<h> Advance Processing: </h> the clearance process will be initiated
well in advance of cargo arrival

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#44:1>
<h> Client Self-Assessment: </h> BOC shall increase its reliance on
client self-assessment and develop an atmosphere of honest and fair dealings

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#45:1>
<h> Electronic Data Interchange: </h> the process will be, to the
fullest extent possible, automated and computerized </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#46:1>
<h> BACKGROUND </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#47:1>
The rapid advances in the fields of transportation,
communications and information technology have made the world a lot smaller.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#48:1>
It has also eased the flow of information, goods and people across
borders, which, in turn, have become increasingly porous.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#49:1>
This development has led to a progressive rise in the level of trade.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#50:1>
The free flow of information has enabled the suppliers of traded
goods and services to more easily discern emerging global patterns of demand,
and the growing ease with which goods could be transported to major markets
in the globe has enabled them to meet these demands in a timely fashion.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#51:1>
The increasing importance of international trade to the economic
well-being of nations has led to the founding of the World Trade Organization
which is mandated to seek the establishment of a global environment conducive
to its free flow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#52:1>
All of these developments converge to pose a unique challenge to
customs administrations.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#53:1>
The increased level and rate of trade flows impose work burdens that
would be close to impossible to address without the use of the modern
techniques and technology which have led to the emergence of these trade
flows.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#54:1>
This has given rise to a strong impetus for many to modernize,
despite having to face tight budget constraints. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#55:1>
The Philippine Bureau of Customs ( BOC) is no exception.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#56:1>
Financial difficulties occasioned by years of moribund economic
growth, have forced government agencies to make do with less in the face of
steady workload increases mainly resulting from having to service the growing
needs of a population that expands at a rate that is one of the highest in
the region.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#57:1>
Such modest economic growth coupled with rapid population increases
inevitably gives rise to demand that results in increased trade flows which,
in turn, translates into progressively increased workload for Customs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#58:1>
This puts the BOC in an unenviable position of being pressured from
both ends of its client spectrum: the pressure of having to collect more
revenue to support the growing needs of an increasingly overburdened
bureaucracy on the one end, and the pressure of having to face increased
workloads from the transacting public with virtually stagnant resources, on
the other.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#59:1>
Being faced with such a dilemma brings about a strong incentive to
appreciate the merits of modernization.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#60:1>
Having to squeeze the last iota of output from tightly constrained
resources tends to galvanize efforts towards efficiency and cost
effectiveness.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#61:1>
The virtues of automation become starkly evident when viewed in
contrast with the lack of skilled personnel for highly technical complex
tasks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#62:1>
However, modernization in this case is not just a matter of
adopting modern technology and efficient streamlined procedures, as it has to
be undertaken in an environment defined by changes imposed by the coming into
force of WTO agreements on trade, the most dominant of which is the Agreement
on Customs Valuation.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#63:1>
Since the focus of these agreements is the free and untrammeled flow
of trade, the changes that they mandate provide a solid foundation for BOC 's
modernization efforts.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#64:1>
The shift to a valuation system that is based on the transacted price
between the importer and his supplier has mandated a paradigm change in the
way BOC carries out its import assessment tasks: the focus of control is now
shifted from the border at pre-release to the importer 's premises at post
release and is carried out in an audit mode.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#65:1>
This plan therefore seeks to recast the BOC into an organization that
is well equipped with latest technology and skills to pursue its goals, in a
client-focused manner, through effective partnerships with business and its
other stakeholders, and with transparency and accountability as its main
hallmarks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#66:1>
It is against this backdrop that BOC is crafting this corporate
plan, a dynamic document that embodies its organizational projections and
action agenda for 2001-2004 and beyond. </p>

<h> External : </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#90:1>
&bullet; Rapid advancement in information and communications
technology spurring growth of international trade and commerce.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#91:1>
&bullet; Trade globalization raising calls for the cross-border
facilitation of commerce through various international agreements and
arrangements.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#92:1>
&bullet; World Trade Organization ( WTO) commitments that impact on
customs valuation, tariff structure, import clearance procedure, and
enforcement policies.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#93:1>
&bullet; Relatively fixed government resources as against increasing
volume of transactions at the border resulting in greater workload, prompting
customs to fully avail of information technology to automate critical aspects
of customs operations and procedures.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#94:1>
&bullet; Growing reliance on risk management techniques to address
enforcement and control issues to be able to refocus scarce resources to
high-risk imports.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#95:1>
&bullet; Escalating national budget requirements pushing customs to
meet expanding revenue targets, to plug revenue leakage, and prevent
smuggling and other fraud against Customs revenue.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#96:1>
&bullet; Heightening competition among world economies prompting the
government to lend support to local industry and to work for an environment
conducive to foreign investment and trade.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#97:1>
&bullet; Intensifying clamor for more transparency in public service
and eradication of graft and corruption in government that motivates customs
to further improve its systems and procedures, and the quality of its
service.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#98:1>
<h> Internal : </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#99:1>
&bullet; Need for more vital performance indicators ( <foreign> e.g.
</foreign> accurate measure of actual daily collection per district).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#100:1>
&bullet; Need for more performance standards for determining the
quality of its operations and services.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#101:1>
&bullet; Need for better coordination between and among
divisions/units, to prevent revenue leakage.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#102:1>
&bullet; Need for improved linkages with other government agencies
involved in the shipment clearance process.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#103:1>
&bullet; Need for a better work environment conducive to high level
of efficiency, integrity and pro-active communication.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#104:1>
<h> Revenue Enhancement ( KR
# 1) </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#105:1>
<h> Context: </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#106:1>
BOC annually contributes the second largest amount in collected
revenues to the National Treasury.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#107:1>
Its collection performance thus has a substantial impact on the
increasing budget requirements of the government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#108:1>
Accelerating globalization and increasing competition among
trading nations are expected to put a lot of pressure on BOC 's efforts to
collect more revenues in terms of having to deal with higher volume but lower
valuation of imported goods and unfair and fraudulent trade practices.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#109:1>
Moreover, the speed at which commercial transactions are consummated
and the rapid transport of goods and people across frontiers add to this
pressure.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#110:1>
To make matters worse, both the current worldwide economic slowdown
and the perceived problem on peace and order have adversely affected BOC 's
collection performance.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#111:1>
The adoption of the Transaction Value System as our commitment under
the WTO Agreement on Valuation is expected to have a negative impact on
revenue collection.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#112:1>
BOC has also to contend with the progressive reduction of the
average tariff rates every year due to the country 's multilateral trade
commitment such as AFTA.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#113:1>
Also affecting collection is the existence of several laws granting
exemptions to certain importations as safety nets and to attract investments
such as those covered by Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act ( AFMA)
and those destined to Special Economic Zones and free ports.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#114:1>
It is therefore critical for BOC to beef up its collection effort
through modernization and automation and, at the same time, aggressively plug
its revenue leakages. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#115:1>
An indispensable tool in beefing up its collection framework is
the immediate institution of a system by which its key performance indicators
can be accurately and regularly monitored.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#116:1>
This should begin with the daily monitoring and analysis of revenue
collections by district and by port. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-009#117:1>
In its drive for a more efficient and prompt collection of
revenue while at the same time relying upon the importer 's self-assessment,
BOC must begin to work more closely with its clientele, giving them the
necessary information regarding their rights and obligations, providing them
with better opportunities for informed compliance, but at the same time,
becoming more vigilant in administering sanctions against violators of
Customs laws, rules and regulations. </p> </I>
