Thank you for being supportive.

You 're really such a wonderful and treasureable friend.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#14:1>

is your gift to God.

Dear Fr. Jack,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#52:4>
I 'm now studying for our upcoming prelim exams on August 13.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#53:4>
I hope that I will do well here at UST so that if ever I graduate I
will also be allowed to work here as a college instructor.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#54:4>
I still see my friends at Sto. Domingo.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#55:4>
Michelle is doing a lot of work lately.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#56:4>
She 's so busy with her jobs as a tutor and an English teacher.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#57:4>
I 'm still adjusting with my new environment at UST.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#58:4>
It 's really different when you 've stayed for 4 years in the
seminary ( the first day was really nerve wrecking).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#59:4>
However, I 'm still glad that I have some friends who were also
seminarians now studying at UST taking up the same course as mine.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#60:4>
Daddy is well and our grandma is staying with us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#61:4>
Our aunt is giving us food sometimes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#62:4>
I guess that about sums it all. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#63:4>
In Christ,

Hey sis! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#69:5>
Hey what 's up?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#70:5>
It 's been a while... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#71:5>
You know I have been seeing this guy from our neighborhood.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#72:5>
He 's really cute but he 's younger than I am.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#73:5>
He 's still in 4th year highschool.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#74:5>
But he 's very nice and a real gentleman.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#75:5>
I hope you could meet him sometime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#76:5>
Anyway, how are you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#77:5>
It 's been a while since we 've seen each other.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#78:5>
Because of all this rains and heavy floodings, classes are always
suspended.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#79:5>
Anyway, tell me more about your weekend and all your experiences
during the past week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#80:5>
We don't get to talk a lot because of our hectic schedules.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#81:5>
But I hope we could hang-out again just like what we used to.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#82:5>

Dear Cheme,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#91:6>
Hi friend!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#92:6>
I miss you already.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#93:6>
So it 's hot there in San Diego?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#94:6>
You should be thankful - - Manila 's been flooded last week due to
two typhoons.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#95:6>
On Monday and Tuesday last week, classes were suspended.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#96:6>
I should be happy shouldn't I?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#97:6>
Well, I am because we had 2 days vacation but when you watch tv and
see the flood waters in Valenzuela, Marikina, Malabon, you 'd limit your
excitement to a smile and wish that the rains would soon end.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#98:6>
So now we 're back in school, going through the old routine again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#99:6>
By the way we had the national <indig> barangay </indig> and SK
elections last Monday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#100:6>
I have classmates who were candidates and two of them won.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#101:6>
I 'm actually starting to believe that our class is composed of born
leaders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#102:6>
I have to cut this short.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#103:6>
I have something coming up.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#104:6>
I promise to write back as soon as I can.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#105:6>
Hope you continue to send me letters.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#106:6>
By the way, my birthday is next week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#107:6>
Don't forget my gift okay?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#108:6>
( Just kidding.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#109:6>
Till my next letter, friend.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#110:6>
Take care always. </p> </I>

How was your long weekend vacation?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#119:7>
Me?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#120:7>
I did nothing, actually I just slept the whole of Saturday and
Sunday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#121:7>
Monday?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#122:7>
Hhmmm.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#123:7>
I cleaned my room.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#124:7>
Gosh!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#125:7>
It was a hard thing to do.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#126:7>
Because of the fact that it was the first time in about three years
that I have cleaned my room personally...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#127:7>
The dust on my cassette rack was enormous, and I had to pull them
all off just to clean everything...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#128:7>
It was a tiring and hot day...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#129:7>
Where have all the typhoons GONE?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#130:7>
While these things are happening, I 'm still bothered because I have
no copy of the book in History that I 'm supposed to study by the
long-weekend, but the classes were suspended last Saturday, so I didn't get
my copy...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#131:7>
I just hope, he 'll not give the quiz on Wednesday...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#132:7>
Anyway, during the evening, it was my leisure time, I watched
<mention> TV PATROL </mention> , <mention> Game K n b? </mention> and the 4
<indig> teleseryes </indig> of Channel 2: <indig> Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay,
Pangako sa 'Yo, Sa Puso Ko, Iingatan ka and Sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan
</indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#133:7>
That was everything that happened to me these past few days.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#134:7>

What 's up!?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#141:8>
I really thought that classes will get suspended again coz I thought
that another typhoon was coming to the Philippines but no...it really sucks.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#142:8>
I miss the days when the rain was pouring and we 'd just talk on the

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#143:8>
Sometimes, we chat on line.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#144:8>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#145:8>
But there 's always next time, right!? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#146:8>
I 'm so glad that the history quiz got moved to Friday...that

vacation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#147:8>
I just chatted with my friend from New Zealand.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#148:8>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#173:10>
guess what!! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#174:10>
The <indig> pinoy </indig> rock band <mention> chicosi
</mention> and the brazilian <foreign> rasta </foreign> group <mention>
soulfly </mention> coincidentally contain a Hindu symbol which looks really
queer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#175:10>
As the cross is to Christians, the <foreign> Om </foreign> is
to Hindus.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#176:10>
It is made up of three Sanskrit letters, <mention> aa </mention> ,
<mention> au </mention> and <mention> ma </mention> which, when combined,
make the sound <mention> Aum </mention> or <mention> Om </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#177:10>
The most important symbol in Hinduism, it occurs in every prayer
and invocation to most deities begins with it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#178:10>
As the symbol of piety, <mention> Om </mention> is often found at
the head of letters, pendants, enshrined in every Hindu temple and family
shrines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#179:10>
This symbol is actually a sacred syllable representing the
Brahman or the Absolute - the source of all existence.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#180:10>
Brahman, in itself, is incomprehensible so a symbol becomes
mandatory to help us realize a similar Unknowable.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#181:10>
The syllable <mention> <foreign> Om </foreign> </mention> occurs
even in English words having a similar meaning, for instance, <mention> 'omniscience'
</mention> , <mention> 'omnipotent' </mention> , <mention> 'omnipresent'
</mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#182:10>
Thus <mention> <foreign> Om </foreign> </mention> is also used to
signify divinity and authority.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#183:10>
Its similarity with the Latin <mention> 'm' </mention> as also to
the Greek letter <mention> 'Omega' </mention> is discernable.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#184:10>
Even the word <mention> 'Amen' </mention> used by Christians to
conclude a prayer seems to be akin to <mention> <foreign> Om </foreign>
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#185:10>
Interesting isn't it... </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#193:11>
I just got back from a conference retreat for our campus

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#194:11>

Hello there, friendly friends...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#208:12>
Just wanted to take this opportunity to give you my sincerest,
sweetest, and prettiest thanks for all the prayers...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#209:12>
Million thanks for coming to the hospital and sending your regards
while I was dengue-inflicted.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#210:12>
Have you not come I would have recovered slowly or even get worse 'cause
the place was one heck of a boring place!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#211:12>
But I promised myself not to get worse 'cause I know you 're all
there to weep if I die...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#212:12>
I really appreciate it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#213:12>
Now I have all the reasons to celebrate my second life.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#214:12>
This may seem SOOOO dramatic but it really comes from the bottom of
my broken heart...

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#215:12>
thanks once again and I know you 're right by my side to save our
other classmates from those greedy ( is that the right word to use?)
mosquitoes.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#216:12>
Thanks to <mention> Off! Lotion </mention> ... </p> </I>

So what 's up?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#223:13>
How 's life treating you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#224:13>
Hope you 're doing well.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#225:13>
As for me, I 'm doing alright.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#226:13>
Nothing much is really happening to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#227:13>
You know the deal <quote> 'same old, same old' </quote> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#228:13>
Just trying to keep myself sane.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#229:13>
There really isn't anything much that 's happening to me.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#230:13>
The only thing I can think of is that my birthday is coming up.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#231:13>
I hope my birthday turns out okay.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#232:13>
After all it is my eighteenth birthday.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-015#233:13>
Well I can't think of anything else to say, so I hope you 're
alright and I 'll catch ya later! </p>
