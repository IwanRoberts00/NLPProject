<I> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#1:1:A>
<indig> Magandang tanghali ho sa inyong lahat ito na naman tayo sa Talakayan ng Bayan 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#2:1:A>
Ngayon kasama po natin si Secretary Monsod ano po
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#3:1:A>
Uh siya naman po ang magpapaliwanag kung totoo 'tong mga sinasabi nila na malaki ang mawawala sa ating <,> sa ating bayan pag nawala po itong mga U S bases ano po </indig> particularly <indig> 'yong mga sinasabi nilang </indig> economic benefits <indig> na nabanggit ni Congressman Guerrero kanina </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#4:1:A>
Uh Mrs Monsod uh uh can you explain to us uh what this uh <.> ben </.> these economic benefits that 's supposed to be can be derived from the bases and how it will effect how it will actually affect our uh country

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#5:1:B>
<indig> Oo </indig> uh before we go into that yeah I 'd just like to comment Rod <indig> 'no </indig> that you said that you talked about the military implications last week and now we 're talking about the economic implications
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#6:1:B>
I think that those are not the only considerations with respect to the bases that must be brought into account
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#7:1:B>
It is also political considerations especially since our military considerations are a little uh overblown already since because the end of the Cold War uh the the this need this tremendous need to keep a security umbrella over the Pacific has lost a lot of its importance <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#8:1:B>
Now we 're talking about the economic implications and whenever you talk about the economic implications <indig> kailangan ilalagay natin lahat ng benifisyo lahat rin ng mga </indig> costs <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#9:1:B>
And uh Congressman Guerrero listed down the supposed economic <O> cough </O> benefits including by the way development assistance and food aid and loans from multilateral organizations and these indeed must be must be said immediately to the public that uh just because we want or the bases go out does not mean that we are saying that we do not want to be friends with the United States
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#10:1:B>
Let us make that distinction very clear
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#11:1:B>
Now these economic benefits are overblown simply because whether or not the bases are there these <.> be </.> part of these benefits a great part of these benefits are going to be forthcoming anyway
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#12:1:B>
Why do I say that simply because <indig> sangkatutak na </indig> country <indig> naman sa buong mundo na walang </indig> bases agreement with the United States <indig> e merong silang </indig> food aid <indig> meron silang </indig> development assistance <indig> meron silang </indig> uh uh uh garment quotas <foreign> etcetera etcetera </foreign> <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#13:1:B>
So that has nothing to do with the withdrawal or the retention of the bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#14:1:B>
What is directly attributable to the bases as far as economic benefit is concerned is the economic support fund base-related because there is non-base-related economic support fund
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#15:1:B>
Alright base-related economic support fund and your foreign military financing that is two hundred three million dollars a year and that presumably will be lost alright
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#16:1:B>
Now okay uh what will be gained <indig> at uh ano pa ang sinasabi nila ang sinasabi ni Congressman Guerrero eh itong katakut-takot na dami ng ng </indig> <.> em </.> employees <indig> sa </indig> bases that will be dislocated plus the plus the indirect benefits of the purchases the local purchases of those bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#17:1:B>
Uh that 's all very well and good <,> now we will say it 's going to be lost if <,> the moment those bases go vacuum <indig> na 'yan </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#18:1:B>
That thing is going to be wasteland
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#19:1:B>
Now Subic has one of the unique qualities in this world
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#20:1:B>
It 's got a natural deep port which makes the potential of this resource tremendous especially uh at the brink of what we call the Asia Pacific age alright
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#21:1:B>
In other words uh the uh world has agreed it is universally agreed that come the twenty-first century and even now that the hub of economic activity is going to be in the Asia Pacific region
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#22:1:B>
Right <,> and we have to be prepared for that and Subic is one of the biggest natural resources that we have
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#23:1:B>
And that 's why the Americans want it so badly natural deep port <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#24:1:B>
So if we now take into consideration that there is going to be an alternative use to these bases and that has been the subject of tremendous studies by the legislative executive bases council then we must take into account that there is going to be investment pouring in to that area which will create employment which will create income <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#25:1:B>
So <indig> anong pinag-uusapan natin ang </indig> bottomline <indig> natin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#26:1:B>
Certainly there is going to be dislocation at the beginning when there is withdrawal these people are going to lose their jobs right
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#27:1:B>
However we must also understand that the infrastructure expenditures and the investments that are going into Subic is going to make up for that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#28:1:B>
As a matter of fact according to the to the bases conversion study uh uh by nineteen ninety-five there will be even more people employed in the Subic area if uh the uh investments uh take place alright private sector as well as public sector investments
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#29:1:B>
So in the final analysis therefore there is certainly going to be pain no change is made without pain but if we do not uh accept some pain for the greater good later on then there are so many things that we will not do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#30:1:B>
I mean you know if a pregnant mother decides she does not want to have a baby because it 's going to be painful isn't that rather stupid
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#31:1:B>
<indig> Hindi ba </indig> because we forget that the benefits of the alternative use of those bases

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#32:1:C>
What what you 're trying to say here uh Secretary Monsod is that the world the world market forces will overwhelm the American withdrawal the temporariness of the vacuum to be created by the withdrawal of the Americans
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#33:1:C>
In other words uh there there is a theory here that if the Americans withdraw there is gonna be a a a rather significant diminution in the economic situation of the country because the dollars that are also coming in now are now removed
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#34:1:C>
<{> <[> What you 're saying here now </[> that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#35:1:B>
<[> Wait wait wait </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#36:1:B>
What do you mean significant diminution
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#37:1:B>
Two hundred million dollars is not a significant <{> <[> diminution </[> 

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#38:1:C>
<[> That 's not the point </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#39:1:C>
You were you were saying on the other hand that uh in the totality of this whether or not the bases are there <indig> darating din naman 'yan mga 'yang mga </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#40:1:B>
Uh no no no uh if the bases are there then the alternative use of Subic cannot be made
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#41:1:B>
In other words we will have to wait ten years before we start trying to get to develop the potential of Subic as a uh uh maritime industrial complex ship repair complex shipbuilding complex the tourism complex <foreign> etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#42:1:B>
You know as a as a hub for container uh trade

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#43:1:C>
Yeah uh <.> ho </.> how does how does it compete with the inter-ports of Singapore and Hong Kong and <{> <[> uh Japan </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#44:1:B>
<[> Well I will </[> </{> tell you something
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#45:1:B>
Uh you know Subic has something that Singapore and and Hong Kong does not have and that is that deep water bay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#46:1:B>
And the the point is that if you are going to wait ten years before you start developing it <indig> eh baka mahuli ka na sa sa labanan hindi ba </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#47:1:B>
That is as far as the economic side is and I you know I it it distresses me that uh you know in this entire debate everybody is talking about the economic benefits of the bases right and have rather exaggerated these economic benefits and have even included such things as my goodness if the bases go <indig> wala na tayong </indig> sugar quota <indig> wala na tayong </indig> garment quota <indig> wala na tayong </indig> <.> ex </.> <indig> lintsak naman ano <.> hin </.> hindi naman puwede 'yon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#48:1:B>
I mean I mean if if you know <indig> magkakaroon tayo ng </indig> <foreign> coup </foreign> <indig> magkakaroon </indig> you know we will be uh unprepared militarily
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#49:1:B>
You know Rod the bases have been here well since uh since early the beginning of this century and uh since nineteen forty-seven since uh our independence
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#50:1:B>
The <.> base </.> the the Americans have supposedly been equipping the <.> Ameri </.> the Philippine Army and yet we have the most ill-equipped
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#51:1:B>
Please tell me why we think that in the next ten years with this one hundred million we are now going to be tremendously equipped

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#52:1:A>
Well uh Secretary you mentioned the investments <indig> 'no </indig> that are expected to flow into the the Subic area when the bases uh is withdrawn
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#53:1:A>
But uh well according to some businessmen the precisely uh foreign investments come into the Philippines because of the presence of these <{> <[> uh military bases </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#54:1:B>
<[> I have heard absolutely </[> </{> I have seen absolutely no basis for that assertion
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#55:1:B>
As a matter of fact when investors before were asked whether the bases had anything at all to do with their decision they said you know they don't care
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#56:1:B>
I mean do you do you think that the I mean why are the investors going to Thailand <indig> eh wala namang </indig> bases <indig> ang </indig> Thailand

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#57:1:A>
Yeah that 's right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#58:1:B>
<indig> E saksakan pa ng dami mas mas marami pang </indig> investments <indig> sa Thailand kesa sa Pilipinas </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#59:1:B>
<indig> O kung sa Indonesia man lang walang </indig> bases <indig> doon </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#60:1:B>
I mean you know just because these things may happen after the bases are withdrawn does not mean that it should it happens because the bases are withdrawn <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#61:1:B>
Number one uh because if we use that kind of logic Rod that means that <indig> teka muna </indig> we 've had seven coup attempts we 've had political instability we 've had an ill-equipped army and the bases were here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#62:1:B>
Does that mean that all these things happened because the bases are here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#63:1:B>
That 's the same kind of stupid logic that leads us to the to the to the conclusion that if the bases are gone all these things are going to happen all these bad things are going to happen

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#64:1:A>
Okay uh <O> laughter </O> we 'll uh we 'll continue to discuss this with Secretary Monsod uh after a few reminders okay <&> commercial break </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#65:1:A>
We are back on <mention> <indig> Talakayan </indig> </mention> and uh this is where we bring to you the Chairman of the Confederation of Sugar Producers Association of the Philippines and he is of course uh Mr Jomari Montinola
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#66:1:A>
Now uh Mr Montinola as we discuss the economic dimensions of the uh bases treaty I 'm sure that the sugar industry which is one of the major industries of this country would would have to be affected one way or the other
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#67:1:A>
How do you assess this situation

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#68:1:D>
Well Rod uh we in the industry is worried about possible effects of the removal of the bases here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#69:1:D>
If we consider that twenty percent of our production sugar production go to the U S okay twenty percent of our sugar production go to the U S for our sugar quota okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#70:1:D>
There are approximately six million Filipinos six million Filipinos dependent on the industry nationwide from up north in Cagayan down to Davao </indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#71:1:D>
If we lose twenty percent of our quota twenty percent of our production which is the U S quota this would translate to approximately one million Filipinos that will be retrenched that will have to be laid off <,> okay so you can can you imagine the the economic uh dislocation that will happen in the countryside if these people will lose their jobs
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#72:1:D>
We 're worried about the peace and order situation <,> that will result as because of this economic dislocation
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#73:1:D>
Well you have also to consider that uh <,> the industry contributes approximately uh twenty billion pesos to the gross national product
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#74:1:D>
The total investment in the sugar mills and the sugar facilities as is approximately sixty billion pesos
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#75:1:D>
Can you imagine and the taxes that we pay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#76:1:A>
Uh Mr Montinola I have a follow-up question to that in reaction to that <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#77:1:A>
Assuming we lose a portion of the U S sugar quota can we not look for alternative markets to make up for the loss in the U S market

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#78:1:D>
Well the U S market is a premium market at this time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#79:1:D>
It pays triple the the world market price
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#80:1:D>
There is no way that we can sell our excess sugar to the world market

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#81:1:A>
Now uh how is the behavior of the the sugar uh uh industry today considering that there has been a play of the world prices of uh sugar these days
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#82:1:A>
Is it in the up trend or low low low trend or is it uh on an even keel at the moment

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#83:1:D>
You know in Thailand in Thailand uh the local sugar price is being protected by government policy which is approximately three times as much as Philippine sugar
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#84:1:D>
That 's why that 's the reason why the Thailand sugar can afford to sell this sugar at the world market even at a loss because they have already recovered their cost in the domestic market
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#85:1:D>
In in our case we are not subsidized by government
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#86:1:D>
We don't get any subsidy from government so we cannot afford to dump our sugar into the world market simply because the world market is is a market wherein all surplus and excess sugar are dumped by the producing countries

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#87:1:A>
Uh how how 's the how 's the price now are you still a beleaguered industry as it was in the uh time of the previous uh regime

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#88:1:D>
Well the industry has started to recover the the plunder of the past regime and uh we would I I in five years we would be able to fully recover uh from that

 <$C> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#89:1:C>
Rod let me ask uh one more question in relation to the bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#90:1:A>
Uh from from the point of view of the business sector <indig> 'no </indig> uh in all the welter of opinions that have come out regarding the retention of the bases is the business sector really for or against uh the retention of the bases

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#91:1:D>
Well uh we came out the other day in an open letter to our good Senators that we 're supporting the bases
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#92:1:D>
We in the sugar industry uh came out already with our own resolution supporting the the stay the ratification of the treaty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#93:1:A>
Now uh Congressman Guerrero uh yeah he is planning to say more about uh the advantages and the disadvantages

 <$D> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#94:1:D>
One last question Rod uh probably uh one point
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#95:1:D>
Is uh if uh they don't want the bases here in in Luzon we can invite them into Negros
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#96:1:D>
We have a deep water port in Negros Southern Negros which can develop the economy further in Negros

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#97:1:A>
That reminds me of uh you 're in competition with Ali Dimaporo because he wants them in Mindanao as well <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1B-025#98:1:A>
Now let 's let 's listen to Congressman Guerrero 

 </I>
