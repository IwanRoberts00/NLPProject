<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#5:1:A>
No I don't think so

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#6:1:B>
I think it 's worth talking about it

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#7:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#20:1:A>
How about you 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#21:1:B>
Green Mile was kinda cheesy

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#22:1:A>
Cheesy

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#23:1:B>
Since uh it was wrote by Stephen King a horror <{> <[> a horror </[> writer
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#26:1:B>
But I never <,> not that I don't like it

It 's just that it never appealed to me

About pretending to be a boy

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#35:1:A>
Uh-huh

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#36:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#37:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#38:1:B>
And then being murdered later on and raped

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#39:1:A>
It was gross

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#40:1:B>
Uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#41:1:A>

You were the one who asked me to watch that

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#43:1:B>
It was a nice movie
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#44:1:B>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#51:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#55:1:A>
We were not together when we watched that one

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#56:1:B>

Fr Glen
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#61:1:B>
I was with Rey and Mike

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#62:1:A>
Because you asked me not to watch it with you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#63:1:B>
Because you will you will be late

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#64:1:A>
Uh-huh and

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#65:1:B>
And you told us that you would be late so <,> we we moved on we watched the movie by ourselves not waiting for you because you would belate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#66:1:A>
<indig> E </indig> but but the thing is you never waited for me

Thank you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#73:1:A>
Because the thing is uhm the reason why you watched that movie earlier than I did was uhm perhaps because everyone would be late also so it would be <{> <[> perhaps </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#74:1:B>
<[> The reason </[> </{> why we met was because of the Bingo by the Jaycees

<[> And you were </[> </{> not there during the Bingo

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#79:1:B>
I was sick
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#80:1:B>
Could you blame me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#81:1:A>
You were not sick then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#82:1:B>
I was sick since uh Thursday

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#83:1:A>
You were not talking to me

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#84:1:B>
You were not talking to me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#85:1:A>
Uh uhm you were not talking to me

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#86:1:B>
Because we were waiting for you that Thursday night

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#87:1:A>
When

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#88:1:B>
At the North Lounge
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#89:1:B>
We always do
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#90:1:B>
We waited for your last exam

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#91:1:A>
Uh during that time

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#92:1:B>
But then you never showed up
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#93:1:B>
We left then we saw you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#94:1:A>
Well my mind was not actually clear at that part

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#95:1:B>
We saw you with who 's that Christopher and Bhang

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#96:1:A>
We were settling a case I guess
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#97:1:A>
Oh that time <,> uh oh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#98:1:B>
And I was sick <{> <[> waiting for you </[> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#99:1:A>
<[> 'Cause we were </[> </{> 'cause we were not talking then

Can you imagine we 're talking about this on tape now <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#102:1:B>
We 're talking about not talking

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#103:1:A>
Anyway

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#104:1:B>
Because Monday uh we worked at J V in the morning then Tuesday I was out

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#105:1:A>
You said J V right

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#106:1:B>
G V

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#107:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#111:1:A>
<indig> Uy </indig> one day Sonia went to the station

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#112:1:B>
And <{> <[> brought you </[> <indig> bibingka </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#113:1:A>
<[> She was </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#114:1:A>
No no it was not Sonia
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#115:1:A>
Uh the one who brought the <indig> bibingka </indig> was a couple and they sort of just brought the <indig> bibingka </indig> because they said they were listening to our show
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#116:1:A>
And Sonia came there because she 's organizing this uhm club which you know we 'd like to call Friendship Club

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#117:1:B>
Kiko and Friends

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#118:1:A>
If if ever we would have to be to to uhm name that organization what do you think would be the best

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#119:1:B>
I can't think of anything right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#120:1:B>
It 's a public service program

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#121:1:A>
I was I was thinking that it should not be only focused on our show but on others as well <{> <[> because </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#122:1:B>
<[> As </[> </{> G V per se

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#123:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#124:1:B>
The Great <?> Goers </?> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#125:1:A>
The best
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#126:1:A>
<indig> Uy </indig> one time <.> i </.> uhm after our class in La Salle when a classmate approached me and told me that there 's this D J who said on air that I was not texting him anymore it 's like as if he 's asking to text him again
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#127:1:A>
And he said his his duty is during the night time
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#128:1:A>
So I guess it 's if I 'm not mistaken

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#129:1:B>
It 's Dean

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#130:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#135:1:A>
You never returned the tape

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#136:1:B>
I haven't returned the tape
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#137:1:B>
I <.> ha </.> I still have the tape at home

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#138:1:A>
You 've got to return it to your friend

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#139:1:B>
Of course I 'm gonna return the tape
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#140:1:B>

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#150:1:A>
Uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#151:1:B>
Saying what

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#152:1:A>
What time would you be coming again to class

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#153:1:B>
Two <.> o'c </.> two o'clock

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#154:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#155:1:B>
For my theology class

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#156:1:A>
So you have built your name in theology

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#157:1:B>
Yes everybody knows that I don't believe in God

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#158:1:A>
<.> Wh </.> why is that
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#159:1:A>
You know when we had Rizal it was like Sir Pieto told us that there 's nothing wrong with believing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#160:1:A>
It 's like when you believe now and you die later and then you realize there is no God then there 's nothing to regret about because you are already dead
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#161:1:A>
But if you die and you realize there 's really a God

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#162:1:B>
How could you regret
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#163:1:B>
You 're dead

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#164:1:A>
Yeah that 's why so I

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#165:1:B>
So

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#166:1:A>
The point is there 's nothing wrong with believing

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#167:1:B>
I think uh believing is just having uh a hope that okay I 'm gonna die I 'll meet this person who who guided me all my life

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#168:1:A>
And doesn't it give you anything like a spark in your life
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#169:1:A>
<{> <[> A hope </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#170:1:B>
<[> You could </[> </{> be a spark in my life <&> speaker A chuckles </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#171:1:B>
You could be my hope

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#172:1:A>
Oh I <{> <[> see </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#173:1:B>
<[> See </[> </{> I don't have to <.> fai </.> to have faith on this someone I do not know 'cause I have faith on myself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#174:1:B>
I have faith on my friends

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#175:1:A>
But the thing is don't you think it 's uhm sort of natural for somebody to hold something above him
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#176:1:A>
Uhm like someone who would not put him down
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#177:1:A>
It 's like I know you can believe on me and count on me but then I also have these times when I go up and then I go down and well I it 's not that I want to put you down but there might be a time that I may be putting you down just like the time that we were not talking to each other

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#178:1:B>
So

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#179:1:A>
So the thing is isn't He sort of somebody who you 'd place above you and like He 'd not put you down

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#180:1:B>
Uh that is making a false hope of yourself
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#181:1:B>
I mean if you put me down it 's just a a mere fact because you 're a human
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#182:1:B>
So not that you 're supposed to make mistakes it 's just that you can't avoid mistakes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#183:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#184:1:B>
Granting that putting me down is a mistake

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#185:1:A>
Uh no okay <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#186:1:A>
Does it give you some sort of hopeless attitude

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#187:1:B>
Why

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#188:1:A>
Nothing <,> it 's just

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#189:1:B>
You 're hopeless not me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#190:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> This conversation really <unclear> words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#191:1:A>
And what else

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#192:1:B>
Uh you know back in U P <,> I had this uh classmate

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#193:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#194:1:B>
Uh his uh point of view or argument is that God is only an excuse that if I ask you why does it rain

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#195:1:A>
<{> <[> Precisely </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#196:1:B>
<[> Because you </[> </{> can't answer you would say <mention> God </mention> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#197:1:A>
Uh-huh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#198:1:B>
So that 's an excuse not that God created the rain
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#199:1:B>
<{> <[> It 's just </[> that you don't know the answer so you say it 's God

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#200:1:A>
<[> Uh uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#201:1:A>
I guess that 's the precise point <O> laughter </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#202:1:B>
That

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#203:1:A>
I don't know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#204:1:A>
I guess it 's for me it fits me
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#206:1:A>
That whenever I do not understand a thing especially <.> i </.> it 's not with regards to things that you could study <{> <[> about </[> but it 's with things that you have to believe in without looking 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#> I always say it 's because of Him because my mind is that limited

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#207:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#209:1:B>
How could you <{> <[> always </[> say that uh it maybe it 's just meant to be that way but not really make an excuse
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#213:1:B>
I mean if there 's a God how would you feel that He 's just an excuse 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#210:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#211:1:A>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#214:1:A>
I just hope that everybody else can understand you as much as the people close to you can understand you
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#215:1:A>
The thing is they have this tendency to put religion down one 's throat and <,> uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#216:1:B>
Can you blame them we 're in La Salle

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#218:1:A>
Yeah that 's that 's <{> <[> the sad thing </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#219:1:B>
<[> A Catholic school </[> </{> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#220:1:A>
That 's the sad thing about La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#221:1:A>
They uhm entertain students from different uhm religion and then

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#222:1:B>
They enforce you to take up eight theology classes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#223:1:A>
And make you believe in the God they in the first place you never believed in

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#224:1:B>
I think my teacher 's <indig> ano </indig> scared of me

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#225:1:A>
Scared of you <indig> ha </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#227:1:B>
He 's a new teacher

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#228:1:A>
<{> <[> Scared </[> or challenged

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#229:1:B>
<[> Scared </[> </{> scared

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#231:1:A>
Scared

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#232:1:B>
Like a virus <{> <[> something </[> 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#> He talks to me like are you fine <&> speaker A laughs </&> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#234:1:A>
<[> Uh-huh </[> </{> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#235:1:B>
Yes I 'm fine everything is fine
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#237:1:B>
Are you

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#238:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> Hello anybody here
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#239:1:A>
<indig> Hay naku </indig> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#240:1:A>
Anyway let 's talk about our favorite author Jessica <{> <[> Zafra </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#241:1:B>
<[> Zafra </[> </{> the bitch from hell

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#242:1:A>
There was this episode and I and I don't know if if you were able to watch it but

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#243:1:B>
Points of View 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#244:1:A>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#245:1:A>
Their show is now on every

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#246:1:B>
Mondays

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#247:1:A>
Mondays same time I guess

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#248:1:B>
Ten thirty

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#249:1:A>
There was this segment when she said that uhm uh I don't know what our guest said but I think he 's he 's been very much disoriented 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#250:1:A>
And he she said uhm it so <.> sarcastical </.> so sarcastic that uh the rest of the cast were just like freezing there waiting for her to say something nice which she didn't and

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#251:1:B>
I don't think we should expect Jessica Zafra to say something nice

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#252:1:A>
Yeah <unclear> word </unclear> <O> laughter </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#253:1:A>
I don't know

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#254:1:B>
I remember one time when she said if you elect me as president the whole Philippines will be in chaos 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#255:1:A>
Why <O> chuckle </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#256:1:B>
And uh all the teachers in U P are practically dying of starvation

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#257:1:A>
<O> chuckle </O> How come

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#258:1:B>
Oh because in U P you have the I think a very low salary

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#259:1:A>
Uh

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#260:1:B>
You teach because of teaching per se not because of the money

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#261:1:A>
Uhm <,> I guess it 's similar with most of the teachers nowadays

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#262:1:B>
They teach for passion not for the money

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#263:1:A>
Uh uhm
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#264:1:A>
What do we do for passion

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#265:1:B>
Eeecch <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#266:1:B>
I have something in mind but I don't think I can say it <O> chuckle </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#267:1:A>
No no no
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#268:1:A>
What I mean is sometimes we tend to do things that are way beyond what other people expect of us and yet we do not wish to have something in return

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#269:1:B>
Oh yeah that that job in G V if you could call it a job

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#270:1:A>
Uh uhm

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#271:1:B>
A non-paying job

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#272:1:A>
How many months have we been working there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#273:1:B>
Since March

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#274:1:A>
And we have received but

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#275:1:B>
Five hundred pesos

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#276:1:A>
Five hundred <,> <{> <[> not counting expenses </[> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#277:1:B>
<[> Plus some expenses </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#278:1:B>
Yeah my Mom is telling me <indig> 'wag ka nang pumunta diyan ano ba'ng napapala mo diyan </indig> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#279:1:A>
It 's it 's the other way around
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#280:1:A>
I keep telling my mother I do not want to go anymore and she 's the one who 's always asking me to go there
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#281:1:A>
I don't know why

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#282:1:B>
Because she 's friend with Ronel

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#283:1:A>
Uh that figures

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#284:1:B>
The SPED thing
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#285:1:B>
What 's that what SPED stands for
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#287:1:B>
S P E D

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#288:1:A>
Special Education

<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#289:1:B>
Yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#290:1:A>
And that 's where my sister goes too <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#291:1:A>
Uhm at any rate I guess I guess Weng 's <{> <[> job </[> is similarly

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#292:1:B>
<[> Weng 's job </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-058#293:1:B>
Of going around the seventy-two <indig> barangays </indig> every Saturday and Wednesdays
