<h> <bold> A candle for Lola Rosa </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#2:1>
MARIA ROSA Luna Henson led a life that could not have been lived
by anyone of lesser stuff. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#3:1>
Her tragedy, as she herself had described simply and
heartbreakingly in her autobiography, began even before she was born.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#4:1>
Her mother Julia was the daughter of a tenant farmer.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#5:1>
To help feed the large Luna brood, Julia worked as maid for the
landlord and, against her will, bore his child.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#6:1>
The illegitimate daughter, Maria Rosa, would later turn out to be the
single reason why her mother held on to life and sanity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#7:1>
With the circumstances of her birth and poverty explained to her
early on, Maria Rosa was determined to make something of herself.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#8:1>
She wanted to become a doctor, and she took the steps toward this by
striving to become the valedictorian in her class. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#9:1>
For a while, there seemed to be a way out of misery.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#10:1>
And then, war struck.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#11:1>
Maria Rosa, then 14, became one of the war 's first casualties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#12:1>
While this period of her life would be known to most Filipinos as
the time she had suffered as a sex slave to the occupying forces, it was also
the time when she exercised many other acts of heroism.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#13:1>
Maria Rosa had joined the resistance movement, the <indig> Hukbalahap
</indig> .

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#14:1>
It was in the course of performing a task for the underground
organization--while delivering for the guerrillas guns and ammunition hidden
under a cartful of corn--that she was taken by the Japanese and forced to
become what would be referred to as a <mention> &ldquo; comfort woman.
&rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#15:1>
She suffered the slavery for nine months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#16:1>
Despite the humiliation, the pain and the dark uncertainty that
her life as a hostage brought to her, Maria Rosa still found time for more
courage.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#17:1>
While she herself could not yet be saved, she found no obstacle to
trying to save others--on one occasion, the village of Pampang in her home
province in Pampanga.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#18:1>
After overhearing Japanese officers discussing their plan to burn
down the village, Maria Rosa conveyed the information to one of the <foreign>
barrio </foreign> residents.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#19:1>
The villagers escaped, and the Japanese turned their wrath on their
suspected informer, Maria Rosa.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#20:1>
It was the torture chamber for her until the guerrillas finally found
and freed her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#21:1>
Even after the war, life refused to take a quiet turn for this
woman who had taken more than her share of trials and tribulations.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#22:1>
Marriage did not work out too well with a man whose nobility of cause
in the <indig> Hukbalahap </indig> did not match his personal character.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#23:1>
She raised her three children alone, washing other people 's clothes
and working in a factory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#24:1>
She would have gone on with her steady, silent survival but one
day, a non-government organization went on radio calling on all <mention>
&ldquo; comfort women &rdquo; </mention> who suffered during the Japanese
occupation to come forward and claim justice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#25:1>
The memories came back to Maria Rosa and tormented her.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#26:1>
Finally, she decided.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#27:1>
She would be tormented no more.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#28:1>
She stood up, held up her life as a victim of inhumanity and demanded
justice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#29:1>
On August 18, Maria Rosa died, her quest for justice not quite
won.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#30:1>
She had won public attention to her plight and those of hundreds of
other women similarly brutalized by Japanese soldiers.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#31:1>
But reparation and remorse from those that violated her had been slow
and niggardly.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#32:1>
One wonders if, in the tortuous language that carried the apologies
of the Japanese government, Maria Rosa 's tormentors had truly asked for her
forgiveness.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#33:1>
Even from that, however, she would save them the trouble. </p>

<p> <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#X34:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I had learned to accept suffering. </X>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#35:1>
I also learned to forgive, &rdquo; </quote> she said in her book.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#36:1>
As a Filipino, a woman and a human being, Maria Rosa 's heroism
will be hard to equal, let alone surpass. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#38:2>
SEN. Benigno &ldquo; Ninoy &rdquo; Aquino Jr. must be turning in
his grave as the nation commemorated his 14th death anniversary yesterday.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#39:2>
The country he so loved served and died for is in a state of virtual
political turmoil, and confusion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#40:2>
On the eve of yesterday 's celebration, His Eminence Jaime
Cardinal Sin called on Filipinos to stage a second people power revolt
against the Ramos administration, which, he said, <quote> &ldquo; has lost
the people 's trust and respect. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#41:2>
The Cardinal displayed this loss of trust and respect for the
highest official of the land with his stinging criticisms: <X> <quote>
&ldquo; This President seeks not to lead us into the enlightened political
stability, social stability and prosperity of the next millennium.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#X42:2>
He seeks rather to lead us back into the dark ages of pre-martial
law political dynasties, warlordship, corruption, sham democracy, and
debilitating poverty. &rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#43:2>
The influential Archbishop of Manila just could not believe that
President Ramos has nothing to do with the sustained attacks on the
Constitution to lift term limits.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#44:2>
To the question which is foremost in everyone 's mind--Why does
nobody believe the President when he says he will not stay any minute longer
in his post after his six-year term ends on June 30, 1998?--the Cardinal
provided the answer.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#45:2>
<quote> &ldquo; No one believes him because his own people do not
believe him, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#46:2>
Pro-Charter-change advocates may fault the outspoken prelate for
again meddling in purely political affairs, but there is no doubt that the
Cardinal articulated the thoughts, concerns and fears of many Filipinos most
succinctly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#47:2>
In Mindanao, Nur Misuari led 400 government officials to a 10-day
caravan to key cities and provinces in the region to gather signatures aimed
at amending the Charter and extending the term of President Ramos.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#48:2>
No less than Misuari 's man admitted that the budget department was
bankrolling the activity, a revolting deed made more scandalous by the
thought that the money used to fund the caravan could have made the lives of
the most recent calamity victims less miserable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#49:2>
At the House of Representatives, pro-administration solons with
more than enough support from members of the opposition added fuel to the
fire and breathe life into the Charter-change project.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#50:2>
Nationalist People 's Coalition members, who voted in favor of
reporting out for plenary discussion House Concurrent Resolution No. 40 which
seeks to convene Congress into a constituent assembly, claimed they were
still against Charter amendments but that they did not want to deprive the
people a chance to hear them speak on such an important issue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#51:2>
The argument is pure double-talk.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#52:2>
NPC solons can talk themselves to death and win the hearts of every
freedom-loving Filipino, but there is no way they can get Charter-change
die-hards to their side.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#53:2>
The opposition knows this so all talk about defeating CR 40 in a
debate is nothing but another insult to the intelligence of the Filipino
people. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#54:2>
The moves to amend the Charter, which started as early as 1993,
have not advanced the common good one bit.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#55:2>
It has only tarnished the credibility of the government and divided
the entire nation.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#56:2>
And yet instead of putting his foot down, President Ramos could only
say: <quote> &ldquo; If they ( legislators) are deaf in their ears, I will
have to shout a little harder. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#57:2>
The point is neither the center nor the fringe holds.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#58:2>
Neither the Ramos administration nor the political opposition is
being forthright about their intentions.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#59:2>
Instead, what is unfolding before our eyes is a shadow play most
tragic because only one thing is clear in the here and now--the lines are
being drawn between those who seek to uphold the Constitution and democracy,
and those who want to now destroy it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#60:2>
Former President Corazon Aquino, Mr. Ramos ' political godmother,
yesterday said if her husband, Ninoy, were alive he would resist the move to
amend the Charter because he believed no elective official should use the
Constitution to perpetuate himself in power.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#61:2>
The tragedy is Ninoy is dead, and is perhaps turning in his grave.

<h> <bold> Rising to the occasion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#63:3>
NOW comes the Senate Electoral Tribunal ( SET) adding one more
straw on our backs.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#64:3>
Disclosing the initial results of its recount of votes cast in the
1995 elections, it has confirmed that <quote> &ldquo; there was cheating in
the elections and, perhaps, massive fraud. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#65:3>
Filipinos can take comfort in the fact that justice is somehow
being dispensed.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#66:3>
Somehow, something is being done to heed the call of someone whose
voice does not count for much in the political future of those tasked with
conducting the recount. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#67:3>
But it is justice so terribly slow that it threatens to become
useless, and so expensive that it is almost unattainable.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#68:3>
It will take the release of &peso;400 million and at least two years
to complete the recount.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#69:3>
In the words of a member of the tribunal, the process may even last
well beyond the term of office of the senator whose election has been put in
question.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#70:3>
If and when justice is finally attained, nothing--literally and
figuratively--is left to the senator who should have won. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#71:3>
But if the words of Aquilino Pimentel Jr. are to be taken
seriously, it is not the proclaimed winner who stands to gain most from the
grueling, frustrating exercise but the Filipino people.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#72:3>
If the election protest is pursued to its glorious end, it just might
restore some sanctity to a political exercise that has been dragged
repeatedly to mud. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#73:3>
Were we to have the energy to do just that, there is, however,
one other problem raised by the SET 's initial findings and this concerns the
Commission on Elections.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#74:3>
If the election officials that presided over the 1995 elections will
be the same ones taking charge in 1998, what kind of elections will we have?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#75:3>
Will it be of the same quality as the 1995 polls? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#76:3>
To be sure, there is nothing in the law that requires any of our
COMELEC officials to cause themselves to take a less active part in next year 's
elections in the light of the SET 's partial findings, just as there is
nothing in the law that requires Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile to give way to
anybody until the electoral tribunal has given its final judgment and
declares another candidate as winner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#77:3>
But just as Enrile may have to bear the burden of a victory under
a cloud, the COMELEC officials concerned--if they choose to do nothing in the
wake of the SET announcement--will have to endure the onus of soldiering on
despite a reputation that is less than respectable.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#78:3>
Wags will say that the burden will be heavy only on those with a
sense of shame, but that may be saying too much. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#79:3>
And yet, the dirty end of the stick is going to be
held--again--by the Filipino people.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#80:3>
Already troubled by the uncertainty of an election next year because
of the relentless efforts of incumbent elective officials to lift their term
limits through a constitutional amendment, the public is being made to see
that it is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#81:3>
Even if Charter-change proponents are defeated or just temporarily
thwarted, where is the sense of celebration in having an election that will,
in all likelihood, be dishonest? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#82:3>
It is a problem that can frustrate the hardiest soul.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#83:3>
Unless, of course, ordinary Filipinos are again able to rise to the
occasion and prove themselves more creative than those they have put in
power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#84:3>
Didn't we say before that we have had enough of old-style
politics?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#85:3>
We should remind our leaders about this, and remind them well. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#86:4>
<h> <bold> What gives, Mr. Torres? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#87:4>
JUST what is it with him? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#88:4>
Last week, <mention> THE TIMES </mention> reported that Executive
Secretary Ruben Torres reversed another decision of the Department of
Agrarian Reform, and approved a landowner 's application for exemption from
the land reform law. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#89:4>
To this day, despite the uproar created by his series of
reversals of DAR decisions, the &ldquo; Little President &rdquo; has chosen
to side-step the issue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#90:4>
Asked to comment on the reports, Torres said the farmers--the 'fringes'
of society?--were just being <quote> &ldquo; too noisy. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#91:4>
The decisions, he said without elaborating, are still pending in his
office and have not been acted upon.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#92:4>
He 's begging for public understanding, he said, because if he sided
with the farmers, the landowners would do the same <quote> &ldquo; noise.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#93:4>
And the trouble with these farmers, Mr. Torres told reporters, is
that they go directly to the media to complain. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#94:4>
Well, Mr. Torres, what should they have done as a recourse?

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#95:4>
Set an appointment with you? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#96:4>
The executive secretary is not being forthright when he says the
decisions are still pending in his office.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#97:4>
They are pending because right after he reversed the DAR decisions,
the department immediately filed an appeal with him.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#98:4>
It 's not as if he hasn't decided on these cases.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#99:4>
The DAR was merely asking him to rethink his position, asking him to
study again his basis for reversing the department 's rulings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#100:4>
And these 'noisy' groups have another complaint against him.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#101:4>
With his decision to convert a 53-hectare land in Rizal into a golf
course, Torres is being asked, didn't he anticipate the problems his actions
would create on the water situation in the metropolis? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#102:4>
The location of the disputed land is strategic to the water
supply in Metro Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#103:4>
Torres ' latest reversal of a DAR ruling would pave the way for the
building of a 36-hectare golf course that, farmers say, would naturally
damage the watershed area nearby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#104:4>
But any expert can always debunk the farmers ' claim.

<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#105:4>
Even Torres can dismiss this, with valid arguments, as nothing but
another leftist propaganda. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2E-006#106:4>
But he would be missing the point entirely. ... </p> </I>
