<quote> &ldquo; ONE of the few remaining examples of Andres Luna
de San Pedro 's works has just bitten the dust.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#X4:1>
For more than 60 years, it stood imposingly at Padre Faura corner
Roxas Boulevard, an elegant white structure in the style of a French chateau.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#X5:1>
Constructed in the 1930s when the Ermita area was still a gentrified
residential section of Manila, it was expressive of its time and place...

The excerpt is from <mention> &ldquo; Demolition Derby, &rdquo;
</mention> Bambi Harper 's column item ( PDI, 5/18/96). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#7:1>
She is correct to observe that at the fast clip we make fine dust
out of our heritage architecture these days, it will not be long before we do
not even have memories of pre-condominium days in Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#8:1>
We tear down buildings mercilessly.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#9:1>
Just so we know what kind of dust we are creating to add more
pollution to our already deadly city air, some of that dust could have been
the remains of the innovative and pioneering work of Andres Luna de San
Pedro, one of the pillars of Philippine architecture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#10:1>
Who is Andres Luna de San Pedro?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#11:1>
Why should we Filipinos take notice of his work?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#12:1>
What relevance is he to us in this day when we have entered the age
of superglobalization?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#13:1>
How can he compare with the revered icons of American architecture
that are now doing buildings in Manila? </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#14:1>
<h> <bold> Architectural visionaries </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#15:1>
Andres Luna de San Pedro was among the few architectural
visionaries of the 1930s.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#16:1>
His vision made Manila a great place to live in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#17:1>
The 19th-century Filipino nationalist and expatriate painter Juan
Luna and Paz Pardo de Tavera brought up their son Andres in Europe.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#18:1>
There he received the best education and was exposed to the latest
trends in architecture.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#19:1>
He returned to the Philippines in the 1920s to practice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#20:1>
Luna de San Pedro was the most senior among the group that
historian Winand Klassenin in his book <mention> &ldquo; Architecture in the
Philippines &rdquo; </mention> ( University of San Carlos Press, Cebu, 1986)
called <mention> &ldquo; the second generation of Filipino architects.
&rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#21:1>
The group included National Artist Pablo Antonio, Fernando Ocampo and
National Artist Juan Nakpil. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#22:1>
These architects, trained in the United States and Europe,
planted the seed of Modernism.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#23:1>
They moved Filipino architecture away from the elegant neoclassical
buildings of their predecessors ( Manila Post Office, De La Salle College and
the many provincial capitols are some examples of the neoclassical).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#24:1>
With them, Filipino architecture upgraded, caught up with the global
trend of the day, and entered what was considered the high-tech era of the
1930s. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#25:1>
<h> <bold> The earliest skyscrapers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#26:1>
Luna de San Pedro was responsible for bringing the new
international image to Filipino architecture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#27:1>
Of his many buildings on the Escolta, his Art <foreign> Nouveau
</foreign> - inspired <mention> Luis Perez-Samanillo Building </mention> (
still standing), one of his best-designed buildings, opens large glass
windows to bring natural light and ventilation into each of the five stories
of the structure.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#28:1>
It was one of Manila 's earliest skyscrapers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#29:1>
His <mention> Chaco Building </mention> , built in 1924 and still
standing on Plaza Cervantes at the foot of Jones Bridge, is still as visually
delightful today as when it blazed the trail for modern architecture 70 years
ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#30:1>
It features a remarkable series of undulating balconies on each
floor, leading to extraordinary corner towers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#31:1>
The building adds a monumental flair to Plaza Cervantes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#32:1>
Before the recent construction of the neo-Chinese entrance archway
that blocked the view of the Chaco Building from the plaza, the structure 's
corner tower functioned in the 1939s as the ceremonial entrance to powerful
Binondo, which has continued to maintain its position as the financial center
of the country. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#33:1>
<h> <bold> The standard </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#34:1>
Luna de San Pedro is best known for his <mention> Crystal Arcade
</mention> , a commercial complex on the Escolta destroyed at the end of
World War II.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#35:1>
Rows of shops opened on many levels to a central glass-covered
arcade.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#36:1>
Its street facade featured glass paneling and horizontal strips of
windows. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#37:1>
It was a Manila landmark, the most popular commercial building in
the city.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#38:1>
<foreign> Avant-garde </foreign> in design, many considered it the
most modern building in Manila during its time.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#39:1>
It set the tend for prewar commercial buildings and was the standard
for later developments in the generations to follow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#40:1>
The vanished house at Padre Faura corner Roxas Boulevard that
Harper wrote about had a checkered history.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#41:1>
Built as a residence for one of the Zobel families, the ownership of
the structure changed hands in the 1950s.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#42:1>
It remained as a residence until the 1960s, when the residents moved
out and converted the interior of the stately house into a bank, paving over
its large garden to provide parking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#43:1>
After the bank moved out in the 1970s, two squat wings were added
perpendicular to each side of the facade facing Roxas Boulevard, ruining the
sophisticated proportions of the structure.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#44:1>
It became a minishopping center.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#45:1>
In the ' 90s, it was finally razed down to give way to a high-rise
development. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#46:1>
That house was a symphony.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#47:1>
It was a meticulously planned, powerful piece of architecture that
solidly rose from the ground and built up in a <foreign> crescendo </foreign>
that ended in the massive but visually delicate roof.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#48:1>
Its <foreign> terra-cotta </foreign> tile roof undulated in a gentle
wave that marked the principal entrance to the house. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#49:1>
<h> <bold> The grandest staircase </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#50:1>
Directly under wave of the roof, a balcony at the center of the
main facade provided an upper level view of Manila Bay across the boulevard
while shading the front door beneath it from rain and sun. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#51:1>
Upon entering the house, what was probably the grandest staircase
in all of Manila wound its way from the foyer, sweeping like a great, curling
wave of highly polished <indig> narra </indig> steps leading to the second
floor of the house. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#52:1>
Even if the house 's design took inspiration from European Art
Deco, the style was sensitively adapted to fit the Filipino environment.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#53:1>
Since the house was built before the days of air conditioning,
windows were bigger than the small European opening designed to keep the
winter cold out.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#54:1>
Awnings above the windows added the aura of tropical grace while
protecting the interiors from rain and the excessive heat of tropical
sunshine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#55:1>
Harper continues: <quote> &ldquo; There are structures. ...that
can be considered historic or architectural treasures. <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#X56:1>
The Zobel house designed by Luna de San Pedro was one, being the
work of the leading architect of the era and an example of a style evocative
of a period known as <mention> 'peace time' </mention> ....

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#X57:1>
So on with the demolitions.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#X58:1>

<h> <bold> The role of <foreign> <it> comedias </it> </foreign> and

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#61:2>
The coming of May is awaited by most people not only because it
is a time of flowers, but more because it is the month of <foreign> fiestas
</foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#62:2>
Until now, people in the provinces anticipate with excitement the
coming of the town <foreign> fiesta </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#63:2>
Even <foreign> provincianos </foreign> in Metro Manila go home, just
so they can attend their town <foreign> fiesta </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#64:2>
For these people the town <foreign> fiesta </foreign> is the most
exciting part of the year for they see the stage shows, musicians, religious
processions, fairs, games, and fireworks, arches of bamboo decorated with
flowers, garlands, ribbons, etc. and colored buntings stretched across the
windows of houses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#65:2>
More importantly, it is during <foreign> fiesta </foreign> when they
reunite with long-time friends, acquaintances, and relatives. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#66:2>
The importance of <foreign> fiestas </foreign> to our ancestors
in the nineteenth century is evidenced by historical records.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#67:2>
Our National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, sent a letter to his friend,
Mariano Catigbac, who was then residing in Lipa, Batangas just to invite him
to Calamba, Laguna 's fiesta in June 1879. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#68:2>
Father Leoncio Lopez of Calamba wrote Rizal, who was in
Barcelona, Spain on August 25, 1882, and told the latter about the <quote>
&ldquo; most animated <foreign> fiesta </foreign> in Calamba on account of
the numerous people who attended it. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#69:2>
Jose M. Cecilio, a close friend of Rizal, wrote the letter on
September 30, 1885, saying that he was enjoying the <foreign> fiestas
</foreign> , while Rizal was &ldquo; studying diseases &rdquo; abroad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#70:2>
Until the 50s, barrio folks ate their supper early during the
<foreign> fiesta </foreign> and went to the town <foreign> plaza </foreign>
in carts or <foreign> calesas </foreign> before darkness primarily to watch
the <foreign> <it> comedia </it> </foreign> and/or <foreign> <it> zarzuela
</it> </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#71:2>
Both <foreign> <it> comedia </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it>
zarzuela </it> </foreign> were staged by actors and actresses who travelled
from <foreign> fiesta </foreign> to <foreign> fiesta </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#72:2>
The <foreign> <it> comedia </it> </foreign> is a form of popular
theater which recounts tales of adventure and passion drawn from medieval
Spanish ballads about the days of chivalry.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#73:2>
The fights between individuals were executed in steps of the
<foreign> curracha </foreign> tune with the accompaniment of a brass or
bamboo band.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#74:2>
The audience either screamed or even booed the performers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#75:2>
The <foreign> <it> zarzuela </it> </foreign> , on the other hand,
is more of a musical theater.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#76:2>
Its vernacular version is responsible for forming and crystallizing
the taste of the masses for musicals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#77:2>
During the Spanish period, the <foreign> <it> comedia </it>
</foreign> dramas from <indig> <it> awits </it> </indig> and <foreign> <it>
koridos </it> </foreign> , which were famous long poems and verses, revolved
around the loves of princes and princesses, acted out by the <foreign> <it>
mestizos </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it> mestizas </it> </foreign> who
were &ldquo; good-looking &rdquo; by virtue of their fair skin, aquiline
nose, and towering height.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#78:2>
They also depicted the fights, between Christians and Moors in Europe
during the Middle Ages, including swordfights, music, bright costumes, kings,
queens, princes, and princesses.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#79:2>
The story was always about the conflicts between Christians and
infidels - - the Moors - - who had come to invade Spain.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#80:2>
The fights accounted for at least half of the total performance
because the audience demanded that fights be prolonged, especially if the
fighters displayed a charming or novel way of fighting with sword, dagger, or
spear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#81:2>
When pleased, the audience would throw gift money on the stage.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#82:2>
Final victory was always that of the Spaniards and this was
considered a triumph for Christianity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#83:2>
The story was almost always told in songs and conversations were
always in verse, so interesting and easy to remember that children could tell
and retell them among themselves, could play the swordfights over and over
again, and could even stage their own <foreign> <it> comedia </it> </foreign>
( with the help of their parents) in a quieter, much more modest version
called <foreign> carillo </foreign> or shadow play.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#84:2>
They repeated the story of the warring princes using stick and
cardboard figures held against a lamp so that their shadows fell on a white
sheet.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#85:2>
It was said that when Jose Rizal was a young boy, he made up
marvelous stories for these plays. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#86:2>
The <foreign> <it> comedia </it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it>
zarzuela </it> </foreign> , and <indig> <it> moro-moro </it> </indig> , which
were adaptations of the European drama, glorified then the princes and
princesses who were portrayed as innocent and extremely kind-hearted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#87:2>
All good was rewarded and all evil was punished.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#88:2>
Naturally, the natives in the audience would cheer and espouse the
cause of the white Spaniard and would emulate the underdogs in the drama who
suffered in silence and would choose to embrace submissiveness as a virtue.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#89:2>
The most awaited character in a <foreign> <it> comedia </it>
</foreign> is the clown called <mention> <foreign> <it> huenchehuenche </it>
</foreign> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#90:2>
He is usually a black man who prances about and says the most
unexpected things.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#91:2>
Today, he is used by the writer to criticize erring public officials,
politicians and attack social ills. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#92:2>
Actors do not just walk.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#93:2>
They march, prance, and dance.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#94:2>
Within a single <foreign> <it> comedia </it> </foreign> , there is at
least three swordfights and as many as six.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#95:2>
The audience await the swordfights eagerly, watching with bated
breath although they know that in the end, the Christian prince would emerge
the victor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#96:2>
The Christian prince makes a triumphant speech and rewarded with
marriage to a beautiful princess.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#97:2>
An angel approaches him and takes his hand and lead him in promenade
among the loyal believers and the departed infidels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#98:2>
The themes in the <foreign> <it> comedias </it> </foreign> were
maintained by the Spaniards in the <foreign> <it> zarzuelas </it> </foreign>
, which they introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, when the
<foreign> <it> comedias </it> </foreign> were fading away.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#99:2>
<foreign> <it> Zarzuela </it> </foreign> entered its golden age with
the debut of Atang de la Rama in <mention> <indig> <it> Dalagang Bukid </it>
</indig> </mention> , a movie adaptation from Hermogenes Ilagan 's most
famous <foreign> <it> zarzuela </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#100:2>
During these years, Filipino film borrowed plots from the <foreign>
<it> zarzuelas </it> </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#101:2>
The first <foreign> <it> comedia </it> </foreign> titled
<mention> <foreign> <it> Gran comedia de la toma del pueblo de corralat y
conquista de Cerro </it> </foreign> </mention> was written by a priest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#102:2>
<foreign> <it> Comedia </it> </foreign> was staged by the Spanish
missionaries as a form of religious discourse, together with the <foreign>
<it> pasyon </it> </foreign> , <foreign> <it> sinakulo </it> </foreign> ,
<foreign> <it> korido </it> </foreign> , and <indig> <it> awit </it> </indig>
, not only to ensure the acceptance and spread of Christianity among the
natives but also to court the latter to support the colonial regime. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#103:2>
The primary motive of the playwrights was to promote the
interest of the Church and the State, thus the perceptions, values and norms
imparted through the crude theater promoted the colonial culture.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#104:2>
The native intellectuals were used to translate into the native
tongue the <foreign> <it> comedias </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it>
zarzuelas </it> </foreign> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#105:2>
Hence, the <foreign> <it> comedias </it> </foreign> and
<foreign> <it> zarzuelas </it> </foreign> helped strengthen the more than
three centuries of Spanish colonial rule.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#106:2>
But the extreme abuses of the friars and the <foreign> <it> guardia
civil </it> </foreign> in real life broke the spell of the <foreign> <it>
zarzuelas </it> </foreign> and led to the revolution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#107:2>
In the second half of the 19th century, particularly in the
1870s, marked by the <mention> Propaganda Movement </mention> led by Jose P.
Rizal and Marcelo H. del Pilar, the discontented local intellectuals used the
same <foreign> <it> comedias </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it> zarzuelas
</it> </foreign> to weaken the power of the friars and rally the masses to
fight oppression and Spanish rule.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-002#108:2>
For instance, Andres Bonifacio, who was a <foreign> <it> komedya
</it> </foreign> actor, wrote verses that called the people to revolt. </p>
</I>
