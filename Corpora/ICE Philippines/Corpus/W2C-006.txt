There are more obese people among the population of Pampanga,
Laguna and Baguio compared to the Greater Manila Area ( GMA), according to
the latest survey done by the Philippine Association for the Study of
Overweight and Obesity ( PASSO). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#5:1>
Roughly 34 percent of the population of these three areas are
obese compared to only 19 percent of the population of GMA, according to
PASOO president Dr. Augusto Litonjua. </p>

<quote> &ldquo; This is a world-wide problem.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#7:1>
I see more obese children now in church than before, &rdquo; </quote>
Litonjua said, pointing out that obese children grow into obese adults. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#8:1>
About 22 percent of the Visayan population are obese, based on
surveys taken from Cebu, Bacolod and Iloilo.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#9:1>
Mindanao has the least number of obese people at only eight percent of
the samples taken from Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#10:1>
Litonjua said it is too early to see what accounts for these
regional differences, but he projected that the proportion of obese people
among the population is higher than the survey shows. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#11:1>
Based on the preliminary results of this ongoing survey, at least
20 percent--14 million--of 70 million Filipinos are obese. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#12:1>
<quote> &ldquo; It is not because we are a developing country
that the prevalence of obesity is less here, &rdquo; </quote> Litonjua said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#13:1>
He estimated that about 26 percent of the US population, 14.5 percent
of the UK population and seven percent of the French are obese. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#14:1>
Obesity has its price, not just to individuals but to the economy
as well.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#15:1>
Direct costs of obesity, such as treatment for weight-related
illness, reached &dollar;46 million in the US in 1990.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#16:1>
Indirect costs due to <quote> &ldquo; lost productivity as a result
of excess mortality, &rdquo; </quote> too many deaths due to obesity reached
&dollar;19 million.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#17:1>
Studies show that mortality rises with increasing weight and body
mass index ( BMI). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#18:1>
Obesity is defined as an excess accumulation of body fat enough
to endanger health.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#19:1>
It is a disease - - not a personal weakness - - , which requires
long-term treatment and management to achieve and sustain weight loss. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#20:1>
The BMI is the most widely accepted measurement of obesity,
calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the height in meters
squared. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#21:1>
A BMI of more than 30 means that a person is obese, while a BMI
of more than 40 indicates severe obesity. </p> </I>

A battle of the stars looms at the local government level as
three showbiz personalities-turned-politicians are up against
actor-turned-President Joseph Estrada. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#25:2>
Caloocan City Mayor Reynaldo Malonzo, a former action star, and
former comedians now councilors Tito Valera and Dennis Padilla and seven
officials are awaiting the six-month suspension order for alleged
malversation of public funds amounting to &peso;39 million. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#26:2>
President Estrada, in his capacity as concurrent secretary of the
Department of Interior and Local Government ( DILG), has yet to sign the
order based on the recommendation of Undersecretary Ronaldo Puno. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#27:2>
DILG legal counsel Julius Raboca told <mention> <bold> Manila
Standard </bold> </mention> Mr. Estrada has already received Puno 's
recommendation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#28:2>
Puno said Malonzo 's admission on double appropriation of funds
left him with no choice but to recommend the suspension. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#29:2>
<quote> &ldquo; Since he admitted it, we have no option except to
recommend the penalty ( of six months suspension).

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#30:2>
If he questions the jurisdiction ( over the matter), that is not up
to us to decide, &rdquo; </quote> Puno said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#31:2>
Since the case against Malonzo and company is <quote> &ldquo;
administrative in nature, it is but natural for them to submit the
recommendation to the Office of the President, &rdquo; </quote> Puno said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#32:2>
Malonzo earlier admitted that his council indeed used the
&peso;39 million for purposes other than what it was intended for. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#33:2>
But he contended Raboca should not be handling their case because
he is an alleged ally of Malonzo 's arch-rival, former mayor Macario 'Boy'
Asistio. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#34:2>
Instead, Malonzo wanted the Department of Budget and Management
to give whatever recommendation is needed to Malaca&ntilde;ang. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#35:2>
He claimed there was nothing wrong about that since his
predecessor Asistio had been doing the same thing anyway.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#36:2>
Besides, Administrative Order 4 signed by then President and <indig>
Lakas </indig> partymate Fidel Ramos, gave local chief executives the power
to move or transfer funds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#37:2>
The administrative case Malonzo is facing stemmed from a
complaint of Eduardo Tibor, <indig> barangay </indig> secretary and an
alleged supporter of former mayor Asistio. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#38:2>
Tibor filed dishonesty, abuse of authority, misconduct for
alleged conspiracy of the city officials in passing city ordinance 9254 that
transferred some &peso;39 million unexpected fund to support the supplemental
budget of the city in 1998. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#39:2>
The amount was taken from the original &peso;50 million budget
allotted for the construction of a bus terminal along North Diversion Road.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#40:2>
The project did not materialize, since Malabon officials claimed
the 89-hectare lot where the terminal was supposed to be built was their
property and not Caloocan 's. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#41:2>
Thus, Caloocan officials reverted the &peso;39 million fund to
its supplemental budget for salary, cash gift and incentives for casual and
regular employees of the city hall. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#42:2>
The six other erring local government officials are Vice Mayor
Oscar Malapitan, councilors Chito Abel, Benjamin Manlapig, Edgar Erice, Zaldy
Dolatre, Susan Punzalan and Henry Cammayo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#43:2>
If the suspension pushes through, Caloocan residents fear that
there will be a breakdown in the delivery of basic services.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#44:2>
For one, garbage will not be collected. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#45:2>
This is because <quote> &ldquo; we have yet to pass the annual
city budget for the year", </quote> Malonzo said, and <quote> &ldquo;
contractors will think twice before transacting with the city government
because there is no allotted budget for the operation. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

Davao City Rep. Rodrigo Duterte 's planned resignation is a big
mistake, President Estrada said yesterday, as he tried to dissuade the former
from renouncing his congressional seat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#49:3>
Duterte, a known political ally of the President, said he is
quitting to prove he is not using his position to protect his eldest son,
Paolo, who is in trouble for allegedly beating up a hotel security guard on
Jan. 27. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#50:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't think he should resign.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#51:3>
The fault of the son is not the fault of the father and vice versa,
&rdquo; </quote> the President told Malaca&ntilde;ang reporters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#52:3>
Duterte announced he was resigning as congressman after Davao

<quote> &ldquo; covering up" </quote> his son 's <quote> &ldquo; misdeeds."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#53:3>
Speaker Manny Villar endorsed Duterte 's letter of resignation to
the Office of the Secretary General. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#54:3>
Last night, Duterte said he was not backtracking on his decision.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#55:3>
But he sounded contradictory when he said he was leaving his fate to
the House committee on rules. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#56:3>
<quote> &ldquo; It 's out of my hands, &rdquo; </quote> he said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#57:3>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora revealed that the President
had asked the Speaker to turn down the resignation.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#58:3>
Villar was present at the meeting between Duterte and Mr. Estrada.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#59:3>
Zamora denied speculation that Duterte was resigning to accept an
offer of the President to appoint him presidential assistant for Mindanao.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#60:3>
Zamora said this position had been offered to Duterte last year
but the latter declined <quote> &ldquo; for personal reasons. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#61:3>
<quote> &ldquo; I don't know whether he will now be more inclined
at this point ( to accept the offer) having submitted his resignation,
&rdquo; </quote> the executive secretary said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#62:3>
Zamora said if Duterte is indeed determined to quit, not even the
President can stop him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#63:3>
<quote> &ldquo; If he wants to resign, then obviously he is free
to do so.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#64:3>
But he has to do a lot of explaining to his constituents because he
got himself elected only nine months ago, &rdquo; </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#65:3>
Villar concurred in a separate statement, saying, <quote> &ldquo;
Rep. Duterte 's covenant is between him and the people in his district who
gave him their full support. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#66:3>
Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago reacted to the news in a privilege
speech, opining that any senator or representative has the right to resign,
as protected by the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the
Constitution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#67:3>
However, she said, he should wait until his resignation is
accepted, or else he could be jailed for abandonment of office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#68:3>
Zamora added that a special election may be called to fill the
vacancy that may be created should Duterte 's resignation be accepted. </p>

The Philippine government raised another &dollar;200 million from
the international capital market Monday night through the issuance of 20-year
global bonds, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said yesterday. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#72:4>
Investors snapped up the bond issue just a day after they
subscribed to &dollar;250 million worth of eurobonds, a separate issuance
from the <indig> Bangko Central ng Pilipinas </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#73:4>
The latest bond flotation was on top of the &dollar;500 million
also in global bonds which were issued last month.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#74:4>
Thus, the global bonds had already yielded &dollar;700-million for
the Estrada administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#75:4>
In an interview yesterday, Espiritu said: <quote> &ldquo; We were
able to get it at a better spread than the first one.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#76:4>
And again, it was oversubscribed with only eight investors getting
their hands on the &dollar;200-million additional issue. &rdquo; </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#77:4>
The &dollar;200-million bonds were priced at 9.787 percent, or
436 basis points over the benchmark US Treasury.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#78:4>
The latest bond float was cheaper compared to the original issue
yield of 10.072 percent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#79:4>
Espiritu noted the additional issuance would replace the proposed
flotation of &dollar;250 million convertible bonds representing the
government 's stake in the Lopez-controlled Manila Electric Co. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#80:4>
<quote> &ldquo; The re-opening was executed quickly and quietly,
taking advantage of an attractive window of opportunity amid a volatile
market, &rdquo; </quote> the finance chief said in a statement.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#81:4>
The joint lead managers and bookrunners for the transaction were JP
Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Warburg Dillon Read. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#82:4>
<quote> &ldquo; While the transaction was heavily driven by US
accounts, it underscored strong global investor demand for Philippine bonds
by pricing within 24 hours of another sovereign issue from the Republic,
&rdquo; </quote> Espiritu said.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#83:4>
He was referring to the two-year &dollar;250-million eurobonds issued
by the <indig> Bangko Central ng Pilipinas </indig> last Monday which were
sold mostly to Asian investors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#84:4>
The original 20-year &dollar;500-million issue was launched
together with a 10-year float also worth &dollar;500 million bringing the
total global bond issue to &dollar;1 billion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#85:4>
Former Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez Jr. earlier criticized
the Estrada administration for heavily relying on foreign borrowings amid the
continued volatility in the currency markets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#86:4>
<quote> &ldquo; We should consider that foreign debts while
cheaper expose us to foreign exchange risks.

On the other hand, it appears that we still have to see some serious
efforts in improving revenues, &rdquo; </quote> he noted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#88:4>
The government shifted to foreign borrowings to finance its
budget deficit projected to reach &peso;68.4 billion this year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#89:4>
Espiritu said the proceeds of the additional bond issue to be
remitted by February 16 would be used for the Pasig River Development
Project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#90:4>
Aside from the global bond issue, the Philippine government is
also firming up a euro-denominated bond issue worth at least &dollar;500
million by the end of the month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#91:4>
Espiritu said the government could even increase the
euro-denominated bond issue depending on the general market conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#92:4>
<quote> &ldquo; I want to make it flexible from &dollar;500
million to so much. ...depending on the pricing and the market just like what
we did with the &dollar;1-billion issue which had been originally &dollar;500
million, then increased to &dollar;750 million.

<h> <bold> Pardo wants garments quota system abolished </bold> </h>

<bold> Eileen A. Mencias </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#96:5>
Trade Secretary Jose Pardo yesterday ordered the Garments Export
and Textile Board ( GETB) to do away with the system of allocating garments
export quotas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#97:5>
<quote> &ldquo; I want to dismantle the quota system in garments
to give the small ones a chance, &rdquo; </quote> Pardo told reporters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#98:5>
Pardo directed the GETB and Trade Undersecretary Nelly
Villafuerte to review the system and come up with the recommendations on the
issue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#99:5>
The GETB had been under fire over its practice of farming out
garments exports quota which was said to be a source of graft and corruption
in the agency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#100:5>
Some 70 percent of the country 's garments exports, or over
&dollar;2 billion, is shipped out under the quota system which assures
Philippine garments manufacturers of a ready market.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#101:5>
These markets are the United States, Canada and Europe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#102:5>
Philippine garments exports reached only &dollar;2.9 billion
last year, or a zero growth from 1997 levels.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#103:5>
Villafuerte estimates the figure to drop to just &dollar;2 billion
this year as shipments to non-quota countries shrink due to stiff competition
from Mexico, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#104:5>
Historically, 85 percent of the quota goes to garments
manufacturers that have a track record of exports.

<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#105:5>
The 15 percent is bidded out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#106:5>
Pardo questioned the bidding for the remaining 15 percent
because even those with a share in the 85 percent are still allowed to bid.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#107:5>
<quote> &ldquo; The name of the game is denying the <foreign>
status quo </foreign> , &rdquo; </quote> Pardo said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2C-006#108:5>

of the imports of sugar under the so-called minimum access volume scheme
