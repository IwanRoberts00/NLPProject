WHERE in the World is Carmen San Diego? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#4:1>
To find out, you must go on a heart-stopping, mind-boggling chase
that takes you all over the world, from mystical Marrakesh to good, old
Manila, picking up clues along the way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#5:1>
If you don't know, Carmen San Diego heads an international
syndicate of thieves.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#6:1>
The hunt is long even as time runs out.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#7:1>
The prey is elusive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#8:1>
You may or may not catch her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#9:1>
Carmen San Diego first emerged in 1987 in a black and white
edition.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#10:1>
She has since undergone a series of revisions and been transformed
into colored graphics on CD-ROMs, CDs, cartridges and diskettes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#11:1>
The espionage game is now a classic among game buffs - - including
adults.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#12:1>
It 's a great favorite because while searching for San Diego, you
also get to brush up on your geography. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#13:1>
Barely a decade after computer games first invaded our homes via
the Nintendo family computer, countless have been invented and re-invented.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#14:1>
Dr. Concepcion Liwag, Ph.D. ( University of Chicago), an
assistant professor of developmental and cognitive psychology at Ateneo and a
child therapist, calls these games a <mention> &ldquo; phenomenon. &rdquo;
</mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#15:1>
Dr. Allan Bernardo, Ph.D. ( Yale University), also a cognitive
psychologist and current chair of the Department of Psychology at UP Diliman,
describes them as <quote> &ldquo; a reality we must accept because computer
technology is here to stay and will probably be part of our lives for the
next half century. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#16:1>
<h> <bold> Interact </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#17:1>
Within their sub-specialty, cognitive psychology, Liwag and
Bernardo have investigated what goes on in the mind.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#18:1>
Both agree that computer games <foreign> per se </foreign> are not
bad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#19:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There has been a quantum leap between TV and
computer games," </quote> says Liwag.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#20:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Those games are less passive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#21:1>
Children interact.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#22:1>
They don't just sit and watch.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#23:1>
Learning is more effective.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#24:1>
They solve problems, make quick decisions, apply previous learning to
new situations.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#25:1>
Certain skills are honed. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#26:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There is also a greater sense of self-efficacy,
&rdquo; </quote> Liwag adds.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#27:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They are in control, they can make things happen.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#28:1>
It 's also fun. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#29:1>
The other side of the coin: As a child psychologist, Liwag would
have children playing hop-scotch, running, climbing trees, exploring the
world instead of being cooped up in an air-conditioned room competing with a
machine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#30:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Computer games could be cutting away time from
other outside activities," </quote> says Liwag.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#31:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They 're interacting with a different kind of
reality.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#32:1>
Images on a screen are virtual reality.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#33:1>
They should be interacting more with their parents, siblings,
friends.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#34:1>
They may gain self-efficacy and control but in what respect?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#35:1>
We don't want to develop skills in a vacuum or apart from values.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#36:1>
Bernardo of UP says there are no hard and fast rules, especially
because today 's children have been around computers from day one. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#37:1>
<h> <bold> No fear </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#38:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They grew up with these machines which are
familiar fixtures in their homes, &rdquo; </quote> concurs Liwag. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#39:1>
According to Rachel Pesta&ntilde;o, marketing manager of Future
Kids Computer Learning Center ( Loyola Heights), kids start as early as three
years old.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#40:1>
Los Angeles-based Future Kids is a worldwide franchise with over
1,500 schools in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#41:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Kids have no fear of the computer," </quote> says
Pesta&ntilde;o.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#42:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They 're curious and interested and want to explore.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#43:1>
They 're brought in by their parents but we haven't had one who 's
afraid or indifferent to computers.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#44:1>
At three, a child learns how to turn on the machine, use the mouse (
a pointing device) and exit. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#45:1>
Small wonder that any child given the tools - - hardware and
software - - can tackle almost any computer game. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#46:1>
While every game is different, all require some degree of
engagement.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#47:1>
However, Bernardo points out that IQ is not a prerequisite.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#48:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Each game needs a specific skill which does not
necessarily have direct relation to IQ," </quote> he says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#49:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The more you play it, the more adept you become.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#50:1>
You develop techniques, strategies, short cuts. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#51:1>
Some friends of his, Bernardo recounts, did an experiment on
<mention> Tetris </mention> or <mention> Brick Game </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#52:1>
In <mention> Tetris </mention> , bricks of different shapes have to
fall at a certain rate into their proper places to form a structure ( the
goal of the game).

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#53:1>
In principle, it 's similar to a jigsaw puzzle or lego.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#54:1>
But one is under time pressure and eye-hand coordination is very
important.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#55:1>
Bernardo 's friends discovered that <mention> Tetris </mention> is
not intellectually demanding and affects only one specific ability - - motor
skills. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#56:1>
<h> <bold> Addicting </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#57:1>
Still, Bernardo shares Liwag 's apprehension that this ' 90s
phenomenon could be robbing children of other rewarding activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#58:1>
Says Bernardo: <quote> &ldquo; Though there is no element in
computer games that can be addicting, any activity that engages the mind and
the person can be so, just like crossword puzzles, reading novels, watching
TV.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#59:1>
They can eat up a lot of your time and take you away from other
things. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#60:1>
So far, he clarifies, there are no reported global effects of
computer games.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#61:1>
The effects depend on the characteristics of game and the extent to
which an individual - - a child - - indulges.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#62:1>
<quote> &ldquo; He could be intensely engaged, &rdquo; </quote> he
says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#63:1>
<quote> &ldquo; He could play relentlessly, with abandon,
uncontrolled, non-reflective.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#64:1>
This could pose a reason for concern. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#65:1>
There should be deeper concern when the child is engrossed in
violent computer games which are rampant.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#66:1>
If ladies are passionately enamored of ballroom dancing, kids,
generally boys, are wild over <mention> Street Fighter </mention> , <mention>
Mortal Kombat </mention> , <mention> Killer Instinct </mention> , <mention>
Rock Man X </mention> , <mention> Resident Evil </mention> , <mention> Super
Mario </mention> and <mention> Children of the Atom </mention> , said to be
one of the latest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#67:1>
They 're too many to enumerate. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#68:1>
<h> <bold> Magazines </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#69:1>
The craze - - if it is merely that - - has resulted in the
publication of five US magazines dedicated entirely to computer games.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#70:1>
Topping the list are <mention> Electronic Gaming Monthly </mention>
and <mention> EGM2 ( Existing Games Magazine) </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#71:1>
Both are quickly sold out at Filbar 's in Quad II at Glorietta
despite the cost - - &peso;225 per copy.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#72:1>
The rest are not doing so bad either. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#73:1>
School boys devour these magazines like chocolate bars or pizza.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#74:1>
Why not?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#75:1>
They 're given passwords, codes, tips, clues on how to win.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#76:1>
No evidence of peer jealousy here as they willingly exchange
knowledge, gems of wisdom as it were.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#77:1>
There is a bond here, a kinship: All of them have one objective - -
to vanquish the enemy, to eliminate, eradicate, to kill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#78:1>
The urge to win is understandable because winning endows the
child - - or anyone - - with a sense of power.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#79:1>
But when the motives are not clear to the child, says Bernardo, you
could have problems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#80:1>
<quote> &ldquo; To the child the effects of violence are not
real, &rdquo; </quote> he says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#81:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You wonder how this will translate into other
domains.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#82:1>
The child engages in it without knowing why.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#83:1>
He does not see the pain, the loss, all the other negative things
associated with violence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#84:1>
When violence is decontextualized and is removed from reality, there
could be no feeling, no regard for cause or consequence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#85:1>
If the child is exposed to this, he grows up with a very warped view
of violence.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#86:1>
Everything is discarded, including values. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#87:1>
<h> <bold> Violence </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#88:1>
Of course, the technology is laudable.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#89:1>
With the advent of the CD-ROM for PCs, actual photographs can now be
incorporated with the graphics.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#90:1>
There 's every reason to be enticed: They are more real, more
colorful and accessible with a mere click of a button. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#91:1>
Liwag expounds: <quote> &ldquo; Once they win and succeed,
children feel a sense of mastery.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#92:1>
There is also the challenge.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#93:1>
Most of the games go on to higher levels.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#94:1>
Some are designed to be monotonous.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#95:1>
The monotony itself can keep them glued to the screen.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#96:1>
They don't have to think. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#97:1>
A number of violent computer games do not require that much
thinking, opines Bernardo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#98:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Which is why some kids play them unceasingly, with
total abandon.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#99:1>
Research shows that certain children seem more impulsive, are unable
to delay gratification.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#100:1>
They get involved in a particular activity and they don't let go.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#101:1>
It 's not abnormal.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#102:1>
These children tend to get addicted if not regulated. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#103:1>
A child 's mind can absorb information but, unlike an adult 's,
how far can the young mind process that information?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#104:1>
A nine-year-old boy says blood spurting from an enemy 's maimed body
on the screen is not real anyway.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#105:1>
The boy sounds nonchalant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#106:1>
Innocently, he brags about having his own TV, a Super Nes, a
Sony PlayStation ( one of the latest in hardware) and a Game Boy he carries
around.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#107:1>
One of his favorites is <mention> Killer Instinct </mention> , and
has been playing since he was two. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#108:1>
Given the fact that these games are churned out and distributed
with near frenzy by manufacturers driven by less than sublime goals - - they
are alleged to be monolithic conglomerates - - it 's not surprising that
there is not much worry about substance or content. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#109:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We have reached the age of virtual reality,"
</quote> says Liwag.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#110:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There 's no turning back.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#111:1>
We can't fight computer age.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#112:1>
But, we have to fight for certain values. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#113:1>
A whiff of consolation to lower-income families: The problem of
violence in computer games is generally found among the affluent, since
computer games are an expensive hobby. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#114:1>
<h> <bold> &peso;30,000 up </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#115:1>
Nowadays, a PC would cost anywhere from &peso;30,000 up,
depending on the model.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#116:1>
A handy, lightweight and impressive notebook gets hefty at
&peso;66,000 ( an <mention> Apple Macintosh </mention> ) .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#117:1>
At <mention> Astro-Vision </mention> at Megamall, which sells both
hardware and software, you have to shell out &peso;15,600 for a <mention>
Nintendo 64 </mention> , an updated version of previous ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#118:1>
Less luxurious and very saleable is the <mention> Sony Play-Station
</mention> - - relatively more affordable at &peso;11,700. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#119:1>
Sweet comfort it is that these prized gadgets cost less the
longer they are on the market.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#120:1>
For all their cyber-age sounding names such as <mention> Nintendo 64
</mention> , <mention> Super Nes </mention> , <mention> Super Famicon
</mention> , <mention> Sega Saturn </mention> and <mention> Sony PlayStation
</mention> , they 're all designed and built for recreation via computer
games.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#121:1>
Like their forebear, the family computer, they are attached to TV.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#122:1>
Software can cost as much as &peso;3,000, particularly the
original cartridge for <mention> Nintendo 64 </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#123:1>
Pirated copies, whether CDs or cartridges, cost much less. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#124:1>
According to store owners, violent games are the absolute top
drawers, with sports games such as <mention> NBA Live ' 96 </mention> and
others coming in second.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#125:1>
Boys are keener on the stuff than girls.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#126:1>
And, despite the apparent savagery of the games, Mom or Dad gives in
and buys them because the graphics are attractive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#127:1>
Boys also love to shop for themselves but have limited budgets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#128:1>
Girls, of course, have tamer tastes.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#129:1>
They go for <mention> Speed </mention> , a very fast game consisting
of letters, and do characters such as <mention> Barbie </mention> and
<mention> Sailor Man </mention> , as well as <mention> Jazz </mention> ,
<mention> Solitaire </mention> , <mention> Mine Sweeper </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#130:1>
But some girls, especially those who have brothers, cater to their
mysterious subconscious yen for violence. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#131:1>
<h> <bold> Schools </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#132:1>
Aside from unsupervised access to violent video games, Dr. Liwag 's
concern is the dearth of educational ones.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#133:1>
True, there are not enough of them mainly because they are too
expensive.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#134:1>
Perhaps due to their nature, knock-offs or copies are not popular.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#135:1>
Also, it 's obvious kids enjoy other kinds of games more because
those related to education remind them of school which they would rather
forget for a while. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#136:1>
But school plays a significant role because it is there where
peer pressure is strongest.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#137:1>
San Beda grade school guidance head Hope Herico feels peer pressure,
the wish to belong, is one reason computer games have caught on. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#138:1>
<quote> &ldquo; When it started a few years back, the study
habits of some students were affected, &rdquo; </quote> Herico says.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#139:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Their grades went down.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#140:1>
We found out why through counselling: They 'd stay up late playing.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#141:1>
They have not had any serious problem since, though Herico
reveals that about 85 percent to 90 percent of the student body have family
computers or PCs in their residence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#142:1>
Those who can't afford these luxuries settle for something else.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#143:1>
Young boys who belong to low-income groups, perhaps also afraid of
being left out, roam video arcades in various malls, seeking thrills their
well-heeled counterparts find within the comfort of their homes. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#144:1>
<h> <bold> Arcade games </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#145:1>
Basically, arcade games are the same ones packaged in
cartridges, CDs and CD-ROMs, but are built into the machine.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#146:1>
You have to buy &peso;5-tokens to be able to play.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#147:1>
With the child 's meager <indig> <it> baon </it> </indig> , how many
tokens can be bought?

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#148:1>
Yet, the child indulges with unbridled enthusiasm, bent on beating
that implacable machine, playing the hours away, cutting classes, squandering
a whole week 's allowance - - all this unknown to parents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#149:1>
Parents have to know. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#150:1>
<quote> &ldquo; I feel they should be aware of what games their
children are playing, &rdquo; </quote> says Liwag.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#151:1>
<quote> &ldquo; They have to investigate.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#152:1>
They can't take a chance. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#153:1>
She paints a fearful extreme scenario of children who are cold,
insensitive, socialized by machine and software. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#154:1>
Which is why children have to develop a range of activities.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#155:1>
No doubt, computers can be a potent tool for learning.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#156:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But the key to learning is variety, supervision and
reflection, &rdquo; </quote> says Bernardo.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#157:1>
<quote> &ldquo; To keep skills flexible, children have to explore
and develop different interests. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#158:1>
With regard to violent computer games, Bernardo is uncompromising.
</p>

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#159:1>

Supervise and control, which should also be done with TV and other
forms of media.

<ICE-PHI:W2B-016#163:1>
Put the game in the context of real life.
