<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#4:1>
Tempering milled rice at 20% moisture content for 3-6 hr prior to
grinding with the Philrice flour mill improved flour fineness ( indexed by
particle size index [ PSI]) of IR24 ( 15.8% amylose content [ AC]), PSB Rc 12
( 23.4% AC) and PSB Rc 10 ( 26.8% AC) without effect on damaged starch in all
except PSB Rc 12.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#5:1>
PSB Rc 10 had the lowest damaged starch.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#6:1>
Wet-milled flour had less damaged starch and steamed rice cake ( <it>
<indig> puto </indig> </it> ) volume but greater white layer cake volume, and
higher softness index ( SI) than dry-milled flour.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#7:1>
PSI correlated negatively with <it> <indig> puto </indig> </it> volume
and SI, and positively with layer cake volume and SI for the 60 samples.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#8:1>
Damaged starch correlated negatively with <it> <indig> puto </indig>
</it> and layer cake volume.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#9:1>
Volume and SI correlated positively for both <it> <indig> puto
</indig> </it> and layer cake. </p>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#11:1>
Philippine rice flours are either dry-milled or wet-milled ( Tua,
1980).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#12:1>
Semidry-milled rice is also processed in Taiwan ( Lu <foreign> et al.
</foreign> , 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#13:1>
Dry-milled and semidry-milled flour particles are fragments of rice
grains and wet-milled flour particles are clusters of starch granules ( Lu
<foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1988; Arisaka <foreign> et al. </foreign> ,
1992).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#14:1>
Starch damage is higher in dry-milled flour. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#15:1>
The availability of a dry-milled rice flour that can be used for
all applications for which dry-milled and wet-milled rice flour are used
would be desirable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#16:1>
Milled rice had been replaced by corn starch in the manufacture of
rice noodles ( <it> <indig> bihon </indig> </it> ) in the Philippines (
Carpio and Aco, 1990).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#17:1>
Contributing factors are the need to prepare beforehand wet-milled
rice batter and the poor shelf life of the batter.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#18:1>
By contrast, corn starch can substitute for wet-milled rice flour and
production of noodles can be proceed immediately on sunny days.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#19:1>
Corn starch noodles are also whiter and cheaper than rice noodles.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#20:1>
Thai wet-milled rice flours are available in the market and can
compete with corn starch and local wet-milled waxy rice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#21:1>
Commercial U.S. dry-milled flours ( Riviana and California
Natural Products) have 95-100%&lt;300 um ( &gt;50-mesh), 60-70% or
75-85%&lt;150 um ( &gt;100-mesh), and 45-55% or 60-70%&lt;106 um (
&gt;140-mesh), whereas a Belgian rice flour ( Remy) has 75-85%&lt;150 um (
&gt;100-mesh).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#22:1>
The Philippines National Grains Authority dry-milled flour in 1980
was either &lt;75 um ( &gt;200-mesh) or &lt;50 um ( &gt;300-mesh) ( Tua,
1980).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#23:1>
Wet-milled spray-dried U. S. rice flour form aggregates of 30-50 um
spheres ( Mitchell, 1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#24:1>
Wet-milled waxy flour has mean particle size of 48 um ( Juliano and
Sakurai, 1985) and 50-60 um ( Yeh <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1991).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#25:1>
Recently, the PhilRice ( 1994) flourmill has been used for the
preparation of dry-milled rice flour.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#26:1>
Mean flour particle size was 280 um with a 500 um screen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#27:1>
To remove the grittiness of baked product from this 280 um flour, a
finer screen is installed to obtain a finer flour ( PhilRice, 1994). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#28:1>
In the dry-milling of wheat and corn, conditioning or tempering
by adding moisture to soften the cereal endosperm is an integral part of the
process.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#29:1>
Tempering should crack and soften the milled rice and increase flour
fineness without increasing starch damage during milling ( Saito, 1980; KFRI,
1994).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#30:1>
Thus, we studied the optimum conditions for milled rice tempering
prior to milling in the PhilRice flourmill, identified some physical and
physicochemical properties of the flour and their effect on the volume and
softness of a typical wet-milled flour product, baking powder-leavened
steamed rice cake ( <indig> <it> puto </it> </indig> ) , and a typical
dry-milled flour product, high-ratio white layer cake, as compared with
dry-milled and wet-milled flours, using three nonwaxy varieties representing
the three amylose types ( Patindol, 1995). </p>

<h> <bold> MATERIALS AND METHODS </bold> </h>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#32:1>
<h> <bold> Materials </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#33:1>
Rough rice samples were obtained from the seed production and
seed health units of PhilRice.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#34:1>
Moisture content was measured with a Dole 400 moisture tester.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#35:1>
After at least 6 months in storage ( aging), they were dehulled by a
Satake TH-35A dehuller, milled by a McGill miller No. 2, and then stored at -
20 C. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#36:1>
<h> <bold> Rice Flours </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#37:1>
Tempering was done by gradual spraying of three milled rices (
IR24, PSB Rc 10 and PSB Rc 12) with a calculated amount of distilled water
using a hand atomizer to adjust moisture content to 16, 18 and 20% wet basis.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#38:1>
Moistened samples were tempered in sealed plastic bags for 1, 3, 6
and 12 hr and then ground into Flour using the PhilRice ( 1994) flourmill (
Renien fan mill model) with 150-um ( 100-mesh) screen.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#39:1>
The mill had to be cooled every one hour run to avoid over-heating
the sample.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#40:1>
Temperature of the freshly milled flour ranged from 30 to 45 C. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#41:1>
Preliminary tempering trials were performed up to 26% moisture
content.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#42:1>
Milled rice cracked and became opaque at high moisture levels.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#43:1>
At 26% moisture, the flour particles clogged the perforated screen of
the flour mill and were mostly retained in the cyclone separator.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#44:1>
Storage of the flours, without drying, in airtight glass jars for 1
week resulted in molds and yellowing in flours tempered at 22, 24 and 26%
moisture, whereas those tempered at 16, 18, and 20% moisture were visually
free of molds.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#45:1>
Based on these trials, tempering was then limited to 16, 18 and 20%
moisture and after milling, flours were dried in an air oven at 30 C for 6
hr. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#46:1>
In addition to a dry-milled rice flour check ( nontempered),
milled rice was also soaked in twice its weight of water for 1, 3, 6 and 12
hr and ground ( wet-milled) with a motorized coffee grinder.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#47:1>
The flour slurry was poured into a cheesecloth bag and excess water
was allowed to drain by gravity for 2 hr.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#48:1>
The wet-milled batter was dried in an air oven at 30 C for 12 hr and
pulverized with a mortar and pestle. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#49:1>
<h> <bold> Physicochemical Analyses of Flours </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#50:1>
Starting milled rices were analyzed for crude protein, apparent
amylose content ( AC) ( Juliano <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1981) and total
lipids ( Mani&ntilde;gat and Juliano, 1980).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#51:1>
Flour whiteness was measured with a Kett whiteness meter model C4.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#52:1>
Particle size index was determined according to AACC ( 1983) as the
percentage of flour passing through a 200-mesh screen from 10 g flour shaken
10 min on a Ro-Tap sieve shaker.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#53:1>
Damaged starch was determined by dispersing 500 mg flour in 50 ml o.
25N HCL for 2 hr at 55 C ( Arisaka <foreign> et al. </foreign> , 1992),
centrifuging at 100 g for 20 min and the dispersed starch measured in the
supernate by phenol-sulfuric acid method ( Dubois <foreign> et al. </foreign>
, 1956) with glucose as standard.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#54:1>
Rapid Vico Analyzer ( RVA) curves were obtained in 3 g rice flour in
25 ml of water held for 1.0 min at 50 C, heated to 95 C at 12 C/min, held for
2.5 min at 95 C, and then cooled to 50 C at 12 C/min ( Blakeney <foreign> et
al. </foreign> , 1991). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#55:1>
<h> <bold> Rice Cakes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#56:1>
<indig> <it> Puto </it> </indig> was prepared according to Perez
and Juliano ( 1988).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#57:1>
Flour ( 100 g) was soaked for 1 hr in 140 ml water in a mixing bowl
and mixed in a National electric mixer at speed 1 for 5 min.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#58:1>
Sugar ( 40 g) was added and the batter nixed for 2 min at speed 1.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#59:1>
Double-acting baking powder ( 4,5 g) was then added and the batter
mixed for 1 min. batter ( 40 g) was poured into ungreased round aluminum pans
( 40 mm bottom diam, 67 mm top diam, 25 mm height) and immediately steamed
for 30 min, cooled 1 hr in the open, and placed in self-sealing plastic bags.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#60:1>
<indig> <it> Puto </it> </indig> volume was measured by the rapeseed
displacement method.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#61:1>
Softness index ( in mm) was determined on 4- x 4-cm and 2.5-mm-thick
samples by a digital penetrometer ( Petrotest PNR 10, Mitamura Riken Kogyo,
Inc.) using a 98-g plunger with 50-g weight and a 50-g calottetipped piston.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#62:1>
Penetration time was 5 sec and penetration depth ( softness index)
was measured. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#63:1>
High-ratio white layer cake formulation was employed with some
modification ( AACC, 1993).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#64:1>
The formula ( in % flour basis) consisted of 100% rice flour, 90%
sucrose, 20% baking soda and 3% cream nonfat dry milk, 60% water, 1.5% NaCl,
2% baking soda and 3% cream tartar.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#65:1>
The dry ingredients except cream of tartar were combined and sifted
well and transferred to a National electric mixer mixing bowl containing the
liquid ingredients previously beaten for 2 min at speed 1.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#66:1>
The ingredients were mixed for 5 min at speed 1, the batter scraped
down from the sides, the cream of tartar added, and the batter beaten further
for 2 min.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#67:1>
Two 150-g batter portions were transferred into round pans lined with
parchment paper at the bottom and baked in a preheated oven at 177 C for 30
min.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#68:1>
The cake was cooled in the open for 2 hr and its volume and softness
determined by the method used on <indig> <it> puto </it> </indig> . </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#69:1>
<h> <bold> Statistical Treatment </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#70:1>
The study was laid out in a 5 x 4 x 3 factor-factorial completely
randomized design.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#71:1>
The factors considered were tempering moisture ( dry, 16%, 18%, 20%,
and wet), tempering time ( 1, 3, 6 and 12 hr) and variety ( IR24, PSB Rc 10,
and PSB Rc 12).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#72:1>
Each treatment combination was replicated twice.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#73:1>
Analysis of variance was used to detect any significant effect of the
treatment variables on the properties of the flour.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#74:1>
Duncan 's ( 1955) multiple range test was calculated to identify
significant treatment means or combinations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#77:1>
The three milled rices had their expected AC ( low AC for IR24,
intermediate AC for PSB Rc 12, and high AC for PSB Rc 10) and gelatinization
temperature ( GT), but PSB Rc 12 had intermediate rather than low GT ( Table
1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#78:1>
PSB Rc 12 had higher protein content than the others but the total
lipid content was higher in PSB Rc 12 than in IR24.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#79:1>
Gel consistency was softest for IR24. </p> <O>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#81:1>
Properties of three milled rices used in tempering experiments and

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#82:1>
Dry-milling using the PhilRice flourmill produced flours with
particle size index ( PSI) of 51-53% passing through 75 um ( 200-mesh) sieve
( Table 1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#83:1>
This was finer than the reported particle size of 280 um for the
PhilRice mill with 500-um sieve ( PhilRice 1994) and comparable to that of
commercial dry-milled flour.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#84:1>
Damaged starch was lower in the high-AC PSB Rc 10 than in the others.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#85:1>
IR24 had the highest RVA peak viscosity and the lowest RVA
consistency.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#86:1>
PSB Rc 12 had the lowest RVA peak viscosity and PSB Rc 10 had the
highest consistency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#87:1>
<indig> <it> Puto </it> </indig> volume was higher for the
high-AC PSB Rc 10, but PSB Rc 12 had the lower softness index of the three
flours ( Table 1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#88:1>
Perez and Juliano ( 1988) reported that AC correlates positively with
<indig> <it> puto </it> </indig> height and hardness, but the hardest <indig>
<it> puto </it> </indig> was low-GT intermediate Ac rice, just like PSB Rc
12, rather than high AC rice.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#89:1>
By contrast, volume of white layer cake was similar but softness
index was highest for low-AC IR24 and lowest for high-AC PSB Rc 10.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#90:1>
The intermediate GT of high-AC PSB Rc 10 probably contributed to its
harder layer cake due to incomplete starch gelatinization as the batters had
similar water contents ( Perez and Juliano, 1988). </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#91:1>
<h> <bold> Wet-milled and Tempered Dry-milled Flours and Cakes
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#92:1>
Tempering the three milled rices at 16%, 18% and 20% moisture for
1, 3, 6 and 12 hr before dry-milling can improve PSI of the flour ( Table 2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#93:1>
Tempering at 20% moisture for 3 or 6 hr significantly improved PSI of
flour in the three rices.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#94:1>
Damaged starch levels in the pretempered flours were similar to those
of the dry milled flours: 3.1-3.9% for PSB Rc 10, 8.0-9.4% for PSB Rc 12, and
9.2-9.8% in IR24.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#95:1>
Thus, tempering did not aggravate the damaged starch content of the
flour and remained higher in IR24 and PSB Rc 12 than in PSB Rc 10.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#96:1>
Tempering of milled rice at 20% moisture for 3 or 6 hr before
dry-milling resulted in flours with similar PSI as wet-milled flour ( Table
2).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#97:1>
The improvement in flour fineness from tempering was less than those
reported by Saito ( 1980, 1987) for Japanese rice, probably because the
dry-milled flour was already fine as indexed by PSI ( Table 1).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-039#98:1>
Wet-milled flours had similar PSI as 20%-moisture-tempered dry-milled
flours ( Table 1): 0.4-0.9% for PSB Rc 10, 0.9-1.2% for PSB Rc 12, and
1.1-1.4% for IR24, because of milder milling conditions, and since damaged
starch swell in water and is removed with the supernate during centrifugation
of wet-milled flour. </p> </I>
