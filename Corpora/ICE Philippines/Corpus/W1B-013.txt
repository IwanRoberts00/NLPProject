Dearest Laureen,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#3:1>
Hi!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#4:1>
I got your postcard today.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#5:1>
Thank you remembering my birthday!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#6:1>
It wasn't a grand occasion.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#7:1>
It wasn't as joyful as I would have liked it to be.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#8:1>
During get-togethers with friends, I was more of an observer rather
than a participant.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#9:1>
I guess there were just too many questions about my existence that was
going through my mind at present. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#10:1>
Cebu was restful.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#11:1>
Marc and I spent about 24 days together and we were at each other 's
throat during the last 7 or so days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#12:1>
But it was good to be with him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#13:1>
For my birthday, I just had cozy meals with chosen friends.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#14:1>
Of course, it was scheduled well.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#15:1>
For three days, I ate at restaurants or at my friends ' home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#16:1>
Yes, I 'm still taking courses this coming June.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#17:1>
I hope that they allow me take 9 units because I only have these
three courses left.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#18:1>
I 'd hate to spend a semester in DLSU taking only 3 units. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#19:1>
Why are you losing weight?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#20:1>
I do hope that you 're eating well there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#21:1>
Please do take care of yourself because I 'd like to SEE you again.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#22:1>
Heh heh heh!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#23:1>
Just kidding!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#24:1>
Anyway, just make sure you 're healthy and happy over there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#25:1>
My hook up with Internet courtesy of father didn't push through.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#26:1>
Don't ask why!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#27:1>
Just know that I got really upset and that I had to remind myself of
acceptance and unconditional loving.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#28:1>
So, I guess I 'll just have to wait until I have more funds or until
St. Scho hooks up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#29:1>
I miss you, Laureen.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#30:1>
I miss our talks.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#31:1>
I wish we could talk soon or be together soon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#32:1>
I hope I can go to Japan December or January as planned.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#33:1>
Want to meet in Hongkong sometime August or September? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#34:1>
This will be all for now.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#35:1>
I 'll write again soon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#36:1>
Do keep in touch. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#37:1>
Take care always!!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#38:1>
With much love and affection... </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#39:1>
As always,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#40:1>
Odette

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#41:1>
P.S. I 've taken up running every other night.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#42:1>
I quit smoking as well. <O> drawing of a smiley face </O> </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#44:2>
Dear friend,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#45:2>
I 'm sorry this is a much-delayed letter.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#46:2>
One doesn't get too much leisure time over here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#47:2>
Besides work, I am also housekeeper, cook, chauffeur, <foreign> etc.
</foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#48:2>
One luxury I miss here is having househelp.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#49:2>
<indig> Dito pagdating galing sa trabaho, magluluto pa. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#50:2>
On weekends, I drive my son to all kinds of activities.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#51:2>
<indig> Sa Amerika, pag may teenager, driver ang labas ng magulang.
</indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#52:2>
Unlike our kids there where there isn't much to do beyond going to
the movies and to shopping malls, children here are offered all kinds of
activities - - sports and academic - - free or at a minimal fee.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#53:2>
Summer camp <indig> lang ang mahal. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#54:2>
During summer, there are all kinds of summer sports - - tennis,
swimming, golf, baseball, summer camp, <foreign> etc. </foreign>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#55:2>
<indig> Tuliro ang magulang sa paghatid sundo. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#56:2>
This fall, instead of tennis, my son is into football so after work,
<indig> sundo 'yan </indig> because there are weekly interschool games on top
of daily practice after school.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#57:2>
On Saturday morning, he goes to a college for a Marie Curie Science
and Math program offered to above-average kids and funded by the federal
government.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#58:2>
Eighth graders, who are in the honors class, are assigned to advanced
classes that give them high school credit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#59:2>
During the course of the year, all students are given national
standardized tests in reading, writing, math, and science.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#60:2>
I 've been in the U.S. five years, and I still am overwhelmed by the
many opportunities that children, if only they had parents like me, could
avail of.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#61:2>
But what touches me most every time I see it is this: all cars on the
road stop when a school bus waits for a child to get on and off the bus.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#62:2>
Both directions <indig> yan, tigil lahat ng sasakyan. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#63:2>
<indig> Sabi ko parang royalty ang mga batang ito. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#64:2>
And yet there are a lot of messed up kids in America.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#65:2>
All these opportunities, free quality education, free books, free
transportation to and from school, all the sport and academic extracurricular
offerings.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#66:2>
<indig> Sabi ko kung dito ako ipinanganak, lahat siguro ng inalok sa
akin, kinuha ko. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#67:2>
One drawback: college education is expensive.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#68:2>
The average annual cost to educate a child is &dollar;20,000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#69:2>
So this is America.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#70:2>
Right now, we are in the middle of fall.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#71:2>
This week is the height of the season.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#72:2>
<indig> Diyos kong ganda ng paligid. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#73:2>
I was telling a colleague yesterday that I still haven't gotten used
to the gorgeous scenery in October; the foliage all around is in glorious
colors - - flaming orange, yellow, red - - awesome and breathtaking.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#74:2>
Sometimes, while driving to work, I pull over and just stare and
marvel at such glorious beauty.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#75:2>
<indig> Kaya maraming artists sa Europe and Amerika. </indig>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#76:2>
The day after a snowfall is also pretty - - everything is enveloped
in white, until the snow turns into slush and ice.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#77:2>
Then we hate the snow.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#78:2>
I personally dread winter because last winter, I got stuck in the
middle of a hilly road.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#79:2>
The tires of my car couldn't get any traction, so the car just
wouldn't budge.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#80:2>
I go out and stood there hoping for an angel to come.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#81:2>
This angel came - - a stranger pulled over, asked me if I needed
help, got into the driver seat, and got my car out of that icy spot.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#82:2>
When he thought I had regained my composure, he told me to get into
my car and asked me to follow him.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#83:2>
I 'll never forget that man.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#84:2>
He kept on driving to where I had told him I was bound for.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#85:2>
He turned back only when I signalled to him that I would be all right
from there on.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#86:2>
All he got was a wave and a thank you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#87:2>
I didn't even have the chance to get his name and address. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#88:2>
America is a country of contradictions.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#89:2>
Here people will either go out of their way to do a kind act or to do
another harm.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#90:2>
<indig> Minsan </indig> , late in the evening on the subway in New
York City, a black man protected me from a crazy homeless person, also black.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#91:2>
When I thanked him, all he said was, <quote> &ldquo; No problem.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#92:2>
We have to look out for one another, you know. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#93:2>
I love this country.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#94:2>
If only Americans would realize their blessings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#95:2>
I 'm doing fine, careerwise.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#96:2>
I am very thankful to Mr. Sibal.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#97:2>
What I have become and what I am as an editor here, I feel I owe to
the confidence that Mr. Sibal had shown me while I was working for him.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#98:2>
My bosses and colleagues at work respect my capabilities.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#99:2>
They say I am good.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#100:2>
Perhaps I am - - because of training and experience that I got while
I was at <mention> Phoenix </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#101:2>
Funny, my title is editor, but I actually don't develop manuscripts
( development editors do that).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#102:2>
I do proposals, analyze the market and teachers ' reviews of our
books, recommend what manuscripts are worth making a proposal on, do sales
projections, work on plant costs, oversee the progress of every job assigned
to me ( I do series, rather than individual titles), discuss projects with
authors - - in other words, I am a heartbeat away from becoming a publisher.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#103:2>
If only I wasn't a foreigner.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#104:2>
Maybe if I finish my doctoral degree, I 'll become a publisher.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#105:2>
I 've been planning to enroll at Columbia University, but I am still
lazy.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#106:2>
Maybe this summer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#107:2>
So how 's everybody?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#108:2>
I miss the university.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#109:2>
I miss my friends there.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#110:2>
Whether I 'd like to go back there again?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#111:2>
I don't know.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#112:2>
Jobs aren't secure here, especially in a company like Simon &
Schuster, where one 's life expectancy depends on the number of figures and
commas on a spreadsheet.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#113:2>
We 're even more vulnerable now that we are part of a huge
conglomerate - - Viacom.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#114:2>
When we are deemed unprofitable, we can be chopped up and absorbed
by other S&S divisions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#115:2>
When you decide to visit the US of A, give me a holler.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#116:2>
We 'll have dinner or we can have coffee at Barnes & Noble or watch
a Broadway play.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#117:2>
Enclosed is a business card.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#118:2>
Notice how I have reinvented myself.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#119:2>
The spelling of my name has changed ( I got tired of correcting
people, so I decided to use the English spelling); some things in me have
changed.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#120:2>
For one the frilly, short dresses and high stilettos have given way
to business suits and pumps.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#121:2>
I 've added a few pounds.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#122:2>
I 'm not fat, just firm.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#123:2>
There 's a little bit of New York intonation when I speak English,
but I still rattle words when I talk in Filipino.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#124:2>
So there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#125:2>
I hope to see you soon.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#126:2>
Should you have a chance to speak to Mr. Sibal, do ask him to call
me when he is over.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#127:2>
I 'll take him to Prentice-Hall and show him the latest technology
in page composition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#128:2>
Thank you very much, dear friend, for your support.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#129:2>
Please give my warmest affection to Brother Andrew, Lita Alim and
company. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#130:2>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#132:3>
Dearest Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#133:3>
Today is the first time I 'm feeling pretty good about the
Season, just after my last presentation for the year--oh what a great feeling
of freedom that is.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#134:3>
I bet you 're feeling that way too about the last day of class.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#135:3>
What better way to celebrate than write a letter--one of the very
few I 've written to friends and family all year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#136:3>
I came home the day my brother Jess, Cel, their 4 children and 2
maids came from Virginia for a visit.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#137:3>
You can imagine how conked out I was those first few days.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#138:3>
Cora, Lito and Raymond spent Thanksgiving here.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#139:3>
Our friend is finding living with her teenager a progressively
difficult process.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#140:3>
Jelo graduated this week.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#141:3>
We hope to spend the time between Christmas and New Year at their
lovely new home.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#142:3>
It will give me time to look for a carry case for your notebook
computer.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#143:3>
Cora tried to find it for me when she came, but was unsuccessful.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#144:3>
Did my <indig> Ate </indig> Nina give you the Quicken disks and
Instruction Manual I left for you?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#145:3>
They didn't want me to send it by mail, but I know how busy everyone
is, and I just want to ensure myself that you got it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#146:3>
I left Moni the original disks and Manual for it, just in case you
would like to see it.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#147:3>
I never read the manual myself--every time I wanted to know how
things work, I click on &ldquo; Help. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#148:3>
I have bookings till March 19, so it won't be till end of March
that I return to Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#149:3>
Unfortunately, I will have to pay a penalty on my airfare.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#150:3>
I hope to be home for the month of April.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#151:3>
Please!

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#152:3>
Let me take you out then--to dinner, dancing, <foreign> etc.
</foreign> now that we don't have to have escorts to take us.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#153:3>
I certainly would like you to visit Moni 's new home. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#154:3>
Until then,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#155:3>
Arabella </I>

December 20, 1995

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#157:4>
Dearest Tish,

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#158:4>
This card is a belated Thank You for all the thoughtful things
you did for me when I was there--the scrumptious dinners, the privilege to
use your library, your delightful gifts, and most of all, the chance to
connect again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#159:4>
This is one of my favorite pictures because it shows a woman on
a journey, evidently enjoying the process.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#160:4>
Do you remember, Tish, how you used to say, <quote> you enjoy not
only arriving at the destination, but the trip itself </quote> ?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#161:4>
That was strange to me because I always couldn't wait to arrive, but
now I know it 's so important to relish the journey. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#162:4>
Here 's to all the other journeys you 'll take in life, Tish.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#163:4>
May they be even more meaningful, heartwarming, and rewarding than
those you 've done before. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#164:4>
Fondly,

<ICE-PHI:W1B-013#165:4>
Arabella </I>
