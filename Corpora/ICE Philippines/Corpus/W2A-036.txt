acuity. </p>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#9:1>
There is a clear need for the early identification of hearing
impairment in infants and children.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#10:1>
Studies have shown that reduced hearing acuity during infancy and
early childhood interferes with the development of speech and language skills
of the child, which if not immediately detected and if no appropriate
intervention has been done, could cause adverse effects on the child 's
social, emotional, cognitive and academic development, as well as, on the
person 's vocational and economic potential <fnr> [ 1] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#11:1>
Although methods exist that allow universal screening of
hearing-impaired infants <fnr> [ 2] </fnr> , still it must be recognized that
not all hearing impairments will be present and can be detected at birth.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#12:1>
A significant number of them will develop hearing impairment during
their early years.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#13:1>
Such losses may be acquired as a result of medical conditions or of
hereditary causes.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#14:1>
Since new cases of hearing impairment can arise in early childhood,
additional screening methods should be executed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#15:1>
As a practical matter, however, the cost of universal screening has
been prohibitive, the biggest part of the problem being the huge expense that
will be spent in operating a universal screening system.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#16:1>
Another issue is the manageability of administering such testings at
this large extent.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#17:1>
For a universal screening procedure to be feasible, this should be
fast, reliable and easily administered by trained individuals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#18:1>
On these accounts, we proposed a system called <mention> EARTEST
</mention> for the early detection of hearing impairment in children.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#19:1>
The system is a DSP-based screening audiometer capable of performing
pure tone air-conduction testing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#20:1>
Note that the system is intended only for screening children who
exhibit difficulty of hearing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#21:1>
As such, the system could not provide accurate prognosis of the
patient 's hearing problems.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#22:1>
However, results of the test provides sufficient information for the
conducting specialist to recommend whether or not a patient needs to undergo
a more thorough audiologic evaluation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#23:1>
An advantage of the system is that it interfaces to any
IBM-compatible PC.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#24:1>
A graphical user interface is provided that allows the user of the
system to easily control the conduct of the audiologic examination.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#25:1>
Moreover, a database system that handles records of patient
audiograms is included in the system which allows important statistical data,
e. g., mean level of hearing acuity pertaining to a certain locality or
population, to be easily generated. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#26:1>
<h> <bold> SYSTEM OVERVIEW </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#27:1>
Pure tone audiometry is the standard measure of hearing acuity.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#28:1>
A complete pure tone audiometry includes both air conduction and bone
conduction testing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#29:1>
Air conduction testing evaluates the patient 's sensitivity to pure
tones via hearing from the auricle to the cochlea.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#30:1>
Bone conduction testing, on the other hand, evaluates hearing acuity
by direct stimulation of the cochlea through a bone oscillator placed on the
patient 's mastoid or forehead.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#31:1>
Testing by both air conduction and bone conduction provides an
indication of how much of a hearing loss is due to the transmission or
conduction of sound and how much is due to inner ear or nerve damage <fnr> [
3] </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#32:1>
Ideally, a screening audiometer should include both air
conduction and bone conduction testings.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#33:1>
However, cost constraints limit us to design the system for air
conduction testing alone.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#34:1>
Although air conduction testing by itself will not provide enough
information to determine the patent 's exact hearing condition, its test
results will suffice for a specialist to note if a patient needs to be
referred for a more thorough audiologic evaluation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#35:1>
Air conduction testing involves the playing of pure tones of
varying degrees of intensity levels on one of the patient 's ear to determine
his/her threshold hearing level across selected frequencies in the audible
sound spectrum.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#36:1>
The generation of a pure tone is done digitally using a TMS320C10
digital signal processor.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#37:1>
The algorithm used is the linear interpolation table-lookup method of
sine wave generation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#38:1>
Sometimes, it is necessary to introduce masking noise to the
patient 's non-test ear to prevent it from participating in the test of the
other ear.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#39:1>
This is necessary due to the occurrence of cross-over - - a condition
in which sound introduced to the other ear may be perceived by the other ear
since sound can travel from one side of the head to the other.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#40:1>
Masking the patient 's non-test ear is usually done when performing
bone conduction testing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#41:1>
Nonetheless, this feature is included in the design of the EARTEST
system.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#42:1>
A pseudo-random bit sequence generator algorithm is assembled for the
TMS320C10 processor to simulate the random noise source. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#43:1>
EARTEST has a software interface program, which runs on Windows
3.1 ( see Figure 1), that controls the operation of the hardware.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#44:1>
The hardware and software modules communicate through the PC 's
parallel port.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#45:1>
Using this software, the person that conducts the examination will be
able to change the frequency of the test tone, vary its intensity, and modify
how the tone is played ( i.e., continuous or interrupted play).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#46:1>
It can also select whether masking is enabled on one ear and change
where the test tone is played ( <foreign> i.e. </foreign> , right or left
ear).

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#47:1>
It has a plotting function for displaying the patient audiograms
on-screen, as well as, a database system that manages the collection and
retrieval of patient audiogram records.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#48:1>
A block diagram of the EARTEST system is shown in Figure 2: </p> <O>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#50:1>
<h> <bold> SINE WAVE GENERATION ALGORITHM </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#51:1>
Pure tone used for testing is digitally generated using the
TMS320C10 digital signal processor.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#52:1>
The algorithm implemented to synthesize precise pure tones is the
linear interpolation table-lookup method <fnr> [ 4] </fnr> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#53:1>
The implementation of the routine is based on a 256-point sine and
slope tables.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#54:1>
Each time this routine is called, the next sample point is evaluated
and written to one of the selected digital-to-analog ports in the EARTEST
board for conversion to the desired continuous waveform. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#55:1>
The values in the sine table are all scaled and represented in
Q14 format.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#56:1>
In Q14 format the decimal values, +1.0 and - 1.0, are represented by
the two 's complement hexadecimal values 4000 and C000, respectively.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#57:1>
All the other values are scaled and rounded to the nearest
hexadecimal number to reduce signal distortion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#58:1>
The linear interpolation method is an enhancement of the
table-lookup method of sine wave generation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#59:1>
Just as in the table lookup algorithm, a sine wave is generated by
successively accessing the sine table at a constant rate, wrapping around at
the end of the table whenever 360 angle is exceeded.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#60:1>
The table index is used as the angle parameter, denoted by ALPHA.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#61:1>
ALPHA is regarded as having an integer and fractional part with the
format: <O> format </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#62:1>
DELTA denotes the step size for this routine and has the same
format as ALPHA.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#63:1>
Every time this routine is called, the contents of DELTA is added to
the contents of ALPHA.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#64:1>
The integer pointer of ALPHA is the pointer to the sine table.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#65:1>
Sample points falling between samples in the table are evaluated
using the linear approximation formula given by: <O> formula </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#66:1>
The method of calculating the stepsize, DELTA, for a given
sampling interval, t, and frequency can be obtained using the equation: <O>
equation </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#67:1>
At a sampling rate of 32768 Hz, the frequency resolution of the
sine waveform generated is <O> formula </O>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#68:1>
A flowchart of the table-lookup method of sine generation with
linear interpolation is shown in Figure 3. </p> <O> <h> <bold> Figure 3.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#70:1>
<h> <bold> NOISE GENERATION ALGORITHM </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#71:1>
Masking noise is also digitally generated using the TMS320C10
processor.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#72:1>
A pseudorandom bit sequence generator algorithm <fnr> [ 5] </fnr> is
used to simulate the digital noise source which is then passed through a band
limiter to obtain the desired analog noise waveform.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#73:1>
The PRBS algorithm is described by the logic circuitry in Figure 4.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#74:1>
The maximum length of the sequence that will be generated by a
31-bit register is K = 2 <sp> 31 </sp> - 1, i.e., the number of binary
combinations of 31 bits minus the all zeros state.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#75:1>
With the 31-bit register clocked at 500 Khz, the cycle time ( time
for the sequence to repeat itself) would be over 1 hour.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#76:1>
The output spectrum generated by this filter consists of noise
extending from the repeat frequency of the entire sequence, f <sb> clock
</sb> / K, up to the clock frequency and beyond.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#77:1>
It is flat within 0.1dB up to 12% of the clock frequency, dropping
rapidly beyond its - 3dB point of 44%f <sb> clock </sb> .

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#78:1>
Thus a low-pass filter with a high-frequency cut-off of 5%-10% of the
clock frequency will convert the unfiltered shift register output to a
bandlimited analog noise voltage. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#79:1>
<h> <bold> DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#80:1>
The cost of performing a screening procedure has always been a
very taxing and expensive endeavor because of the large number of testings
that need to be executed.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#81:1>
For a screening procedure to be feasible, it should be simple,
low-cost, highly-sensitive and readily implementable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#82:1>
The EARTEST system we proposed for detecting hearing impairment seeks
to satisfy these requirements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#83:1>
The EARTEST system screens individuals who exhibit difficulty of
hearing by testing for pure tone air conduction hearing.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#84:1>
This procedure is the usual first step for identifying hearing
impairments.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#85:1>
It provides a profile of the patient 's hearing acuity across the
audible sound spectrum by eliciting feedback from the patients themselves.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#86:1>
Hence, the data that are generated can be considered highly sensitive
of the patient 's hearing condition.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#87:1>
Patient 's response to this test are usually immediate.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#88:1>
A complete audiogram can be performed in roughly three minutes which
is ideal if you want the screening procedure to cover a large number of
patients in a short time period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#89:1>
The EARTEST system is easy to use and is readily implementable.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#90:1>
Setting up the system takes only two steps - - 1) install the
software interface program in the PC and 2) connect the accompanying hardware
to the PC 's parallel port.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#91:1>
The layout of the software interface has been patterned after the
front panel of a commercial audiometer <fnr> [ 6] </fnr> so that the
audiologist that would be using the system could easily get familiarized with
its operation.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#92:1>
The GUI automatically performs system diagnostics so that if there
are problems in the set-up, the user will be appropriately notified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#93:1>
The EARTEST hardware component has been designed with cheap
electronic ICs and a low-cost digital signal processor.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#94:1>
This is done to lessen the cost of the system, without compromising
the precision of the test tones generated by the system.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#95:1>
It was designed to be as compact and as light as possible to bring to
remote test sites. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#96:1>
The EARTEST system will be tested by a group of volunteer
audiologists in one of the local schools in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#97:1>
The system shall be evaluated on the ease of its use, sensitivity of
the system based on the number of misreferrals, and other points pertinent to
the conduct of the screening procedure. </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#98:1>
<h> <bold> CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#99:1>
A low-cost DSP-based solution for detecting hearing impairment
has been described.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#100:1>
The system is called <mention> EARTEST </mention> and is primarily
used in performing pure tone air conduction hearing tests.

<ICE-PHI:W2A-036#101:1>
The system is presently being evaluated for its operability and
feasibility as a screening procedure for detecting hearing impairment. </p>
