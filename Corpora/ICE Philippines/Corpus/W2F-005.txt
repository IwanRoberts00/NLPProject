<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#3:1>
<it> A strange delirium afflicts Sarah, bidden by music from long
ago. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#4:1>
After a solitary lunch she went to the backyard.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#5:1>
Carefully, unhurriedly, as if she was going to perform some ancient
ritual, she piled dry twigs and leaves, made a hole in the middle of the
pile, and lighted a matchstick. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#6:1>
With a lump in her throat, she slowly untied a bundle of old
letters.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#7:1>
She opened each letter and read every word in it, committing it to
fragile memory, before dropping it into the crater of burning leaves.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#8:1>
She watched the swift transformation of white into black as the
tongues of orange flame licked the edges of each letter.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#9:1>
She read the next letter, and the next.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#10:1>
Each time she dropped it, the hungry flame swiftly swallowed it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#11:1>
Soon she was quietly sobbing as images of the past flit through her
mind, conjured up by the words a romantic young girl had written to her love
long ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#12:1>
Many letters recalled the contrast between the changes in the world
of nature and the steadfastness of her affection, between the transitory
character of a turquoise sky and the waves that sweep the strand,
obliterating the footprints, and the eternal holiness of her heart.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#13:1>
Then she read his letters ( he who was the son of a Protestant
minister), short but concise, and had the quaint rhythm of the King James
Bible, the balanced and pointed antithesis.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#14:1>
Yet those letters were not less passionate.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#15:1>
Even when he quoted the words of Ruth, it had seemed to her then, as
it seemed to her now, as though those words were first spoken by him... <X>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#X16:1>
<quote> Entreat me not leave thee... for whither thou goest I will
go... </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#17:1>
The shrill cry of cicadas from the fire trees woke her from her
reverie.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#18:1>
She tarried and watched the embers die out, listening to the last few
crackles of remaining twigs.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#19:1>
She put her wrinkled arms around her wrinkled knees and gave out a
primordial scream above the din of cicadas.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#20:1>
Then a spasm of sobs shook her frail body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#21:1>
Wiping her tears with the back of her hand, she passed through
the kitchen door.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#22:1>
As she entered the living room, the parrot in its stout, aluminum
cage greeted her with rapid fire <quote> &ldquo; Hello Come in Are you going
out Goodbye, &rdquo; </quote> the only group of sentences the Celebes bird, a
gift to her husband from a wealthy client, managed to remember in a lifetime.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#23:1>
She gave the bird a dagger look for its impertinence, though in
former, noisier times she used to respond with <quote> &ldquo; No one is
going out, you son of a bird, &rdquo; </quote> a response made fashionable by
the inimitable wit of the neighbor, Mrs. de la Cuesta, not only because of
the pun, but also because the bird was a female.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#24:1>
Approaching the cage she raised a threatening hand, and the poor,
balding parrot winced in fear and retreated to the far end of its bar,
dragging its tethered foot in haste.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#25:1>
In its corner it gave her a timorous and abashed look so that a
twinge of pity, guilt and some vague recognition of kinship shot up her spine
to the base of her skull.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#26:1>
All at once she remembered with deep longing how she had spent one
whole afternoon trying to teach the bird, when it was new in the house and
everybody 's favorite entertainer, a stanza of verses written by her
classmate in the graduate school many years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#27:1>
By rote the bird could manage only the first four lines, but it was
enough to make her shout triumphantly <quote> &ldquo; She did it!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#28:1>
She did it &rdquo; </quote> to the consternation of her children,
when she heard the bird, albeit with its own bird-accent, repeat the lines:
<quote> &ldquo; may I come in/and drink your gin/ the night is cold/ and I am
old. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#29:1>
The bird, however, had a short memory for verses, and lacked
practice, so in less than two months it could only mumble a few syllables
intelligible to no one but itself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#30:1>
But now she was in no mood to indulge in softer feelings for the
bird, so she left it alone.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#31:1>
Something violent was spinning in her head as she moved about the
living room and started smashing the breakables.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#32:1>
She hurled them against the wall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#33:1>
Every bric-a-brac hurtled though the living room: the crystal
figurines, the glass paperweights, the plaster gods of fertility, and the
miniature ceramic vases of different shapes and designs.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#34:1>
With one violent sweep of her arm, the plaster menagerie on the piano
top crashed to the floor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#35:1>
Soon the floor of polished wood tiles was dominated by shiny shards
and whitish fragments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#36:1>
She went to her bedroom upstairs.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#37:1>
There she started tearing the bedcover, the bedsheets and the
pillowcases.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#38:1>
She smashed the pillow against the wooden headboard until they gave
out at the seams, and tiny <foreign> kapok </foreign> feathers flew around
her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#39:1>
She tore up the pages of pop romances, her insomnia cure for the last
year, and hurled the mangled copies everywhere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#40:1>
She slid to one side the door of the built-in cabinet where her
husband 's wardrobe was.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#41:1>
One by one she unhooked the shirts and trousers from the hangers.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#42:1>
With a pair of sharp scissors she shredded each <indig> barong
Tagalog </indig> , each <foreign> camisa de chino </foreign> , each
long-sleeved shirt, each pair of trousers, until there was a waist-high pile
of shredded fabric on the floor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#43:1>
She opened the door leading to her husband 's study room, which
she, in the solitude of the months following her husband 's death, kept
immaculately clean by sweeping the floor every day and dusting and repeatedly
rearranging the books and old journals and magazines.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#44:1>
It was a small room, but the formal, seried ranks of law books and
encyclopedias greeted her with a silence that made the room seem huge.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#45:1>
For a while it seemed as if the shelves reached the sky.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#46:1>
Even the paperweight seemed like a huge rock rolling toward her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#47:1>
When she switched on the cable lamp, there was a sudden sunburst of
cosmic intensity that blinded her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#48:1>
She raised her arm as if to ward off the assault of the blinding
light.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#49:1>
She turned it off.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#50:1>
She retreated toward the door.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#51:1>
When she pulled the doorknob behind her, the door slammed with
thundering vibrations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#52:1>
Though all the music boxes, which she had bought for her four
children, had long ago stopped playing their minuets and sarabands, she
seemed to be hearing music somewhere.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#53:1>
She clambered up the high bed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#54:1>
Bidden by that strange music, she slowly started to move her limbs.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#55:1>
She moved awkwardly, turning her body with great effort.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#56:1>
Soon she was singing but the voice at first did not seem like her
own.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#57:1>
It seemed to come from a great distance, the faint voice of a
ventriloquist god, the voice from the past of primordial origin, bidding her
to dance.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#58:1>
As her voice grew louder, her lips began to shape the syllables of a
song of lamentation, which she had learned from her grandmother.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#59:1>
Then her movements became furious and delirious, her limbs were
uncoordinated, her head shook up and down, her long hair flew.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#60:1>
Like a medium in the throes of divine revelation, she whirled madly
about, emitting a sound, a cry of radical pitch and timbre, and tearing at
her hair, standing, lying down and jumping on the twisted heap of torn
bedsheets and pillow cases.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#61:1>
Repeatedly, she ripped her dress till her dry, sagging breasts were
exposed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#62:1>
Between grief and anger she ripped her underthings.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#63:1>
Lying down on her back she started gyrating her groin, thrusting it
up and down in a gesture of imagined lovemaking, moaning, crying, cursing,
screaming out the name of her dead husband...

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#64:1>
Salathiel...

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#65:1>
Salathiel... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#66:1>
When it was over she lay exhausted.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#67:1>
Athwart the high, wide bed, with half of her body on the edge, she
dropped her exhausted limbs, her spread arms reaching the floor.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#68:1>
A convulsion of pain and pleasure, a sense of release, had overcome
her body.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#69:1>
Now a feeling of numbness settled in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#70:1>
The dance had so drained her she had no more strength left to
rise and pick up the bits and pieces scattered about in the living room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#71:1>
She would let them be for some time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#72:1>
No one else was in the house.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#73:1>
There was no need to pick them up--at least, not for now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#74:1>
Nor, she told herself, would she go to the backyard and gather up the
ashes of burnt letters in a small measure box and carry it around wherever
she would go henceforth.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#75:1>
She had no need of ashes, even of those letters which had made her
swoon when she was a coed, and which had made her swear to love him and serve
him as long as she lived. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#76:1>
After the frenzy of her dance there was a yawning quietness in
the room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#77:1>
The shreds of torn clothes and bedsheets lay peacefully in heaps and
piles.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#78:1>
The <foreign> kapok </foreign> clouds of blown-out pillows settled
indifferently on her numbed arms.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#79:1>
Only once in a while did she move to brush them off her face. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#80:1>
Among the peaceful shreds in the room she lay unmoving, among the
things she should have parted with a year ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#81:1>
Her children had urged her to sell them or donate them to charitable
institutions.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#82:1>
She had refused to part with them, clinging to the illusion that as
long as these things were in the house, as long as they surrounded her, her
husband was alive, his presence multiplied in them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#83:1>
<quote> Music I heard with you was more than music, </quote> she
repeated in her mind a poet 's words.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#84:1>
She couldn't part with them, give them away or sell them to people to
whom they were material things.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#85:1>
They were not, those things in the living room and the study room,
mere objects to adorn and clutter up a room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#86:1>
They were parables which time left behind as it ran along.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#87:1>
Each piece had a distinct genesis: how it was acquired, where, when,
how much, for what occasion, given by which friend.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#88:1>
Together they made up the story of their lives, first as sweethearts
in college, then as husband and wife, and later as father and mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#89:1>
Like one of the broken paperweights in the living room on which
she had her name inscribed below a red rose.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#90:1>
She had given it to him in college as a Valentine gift.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#91:1>
On that occasion he told her <quote> &ldquo; Sarah, don't you mind if
I look at other girls.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#92:1>
It is only my eyes that they command, never my heart.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#93:1>
You know to whom this ( touching his heart) belongs. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#94:1>
Coming from him, a man of few words, she could not help feeling like
she was in clouds.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#95:1>
She had known then that such a man was going to be her husband, and
not just because he was as tall as she wanted her man to be.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#96:1>
When he had spoken those words, she couldn't care less if he had been
a midget as she snuggled cozily in his strong brown arms while the wind from
Tanon Strait, whipping up the sea below them that Saturday morning on a
promontory by the shore, blew at her hair which he kissed with passionate
tenderness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#97:1>
When she woke up it was late in the afternoon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#98:1>
There was a subdued glow in the room.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#99:1>
The quietness around her, broken now and then by the cicadas, whose
fierce, eerie cry only deepened it, made her long for the company of her son,
who had come home from New York ostensibly to be with her on the first death
anniversary of his father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#100:1>
Since the anniversary was still a couple of days away when he came
to town, Ray, as the family fondly called him, had gone scuba diving in
Sumilon Island with former high school classmates, who like himself were
successful professionals in their mid-thirties.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#101:1>
Sarah was expecting her youngest child, now a skilled orthopedic
surgeon and her endless source of pride, to be back anytime the next day to
quietly remember with her the man to whom she had given her heart when she
was a romantic coed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-005#102:1>
She and Ray had planned to visit the cemetery together, offer
flowers to the dear departed before going to the nine-thirty service at the
Presbyterian Church, have lunch with the few surviving friends of her husband 's
at the fashionable resort hotel, and spend the rest of the afternoon
leisurely with the orchids and anthuriums in her backyard, while Ray could go
visit his former college teacher who had not quite retired from service and
still riding the rickety bicycle which had traversed better roads. </p> </I>
