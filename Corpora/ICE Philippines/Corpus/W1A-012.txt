<h> Bus Drivers' Way of Driving </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#2:1>
Jason M. Balingit

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#3:1>
There are a lot of drivers in Metro Manila.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#4:1>
Some are careful and some are careless.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#5:1>
All have different styles and way of driving.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#6:1>
There are taxi drivers and jeepney drivers but bus drivers is a good
topic to talk about. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#7:1>
There are three kinds of bus drivers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#8:1>
The first kind thinks that his bus is a racer.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#9:1>
He is the type of driver who likes to speed up whenever possible that
he wants to go to their destination as fast as he can.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#10:1>
He believes that this kind of driving is careful that they will not
be involved in an accident.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#11:1>
He is not afraid of involving in an accident because he was never
involved in his past.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#12:1>
In this kind of driving, passengers will not feel sleepy and will
never forget this ride. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#13:1>
The second is a slow driver.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#14:1>
He likes to pick-up almost all passengers on his way even if there
are no vacant seats.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#15:1>
The ride is very slow that time is doubled an ordinary ride.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#16:1>
This kind is very common to bus drivers that the bus is overloaded
and has little spaces because of the number of passengers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#17:1>
The third doesn't like overloading and he only picks passengers
if there are vacant seats.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#18:1>
He is careful on his driving that the bus is neither very fast nor
very slow.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#19:1>
He cares for his passengers and he secures their safety.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#20:1>
He is afraid of involving in an accident that he doesn't want to lose
lives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#21:1>
With these drivers, passengers are calm and can secure their safety.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#22:1>
I have experienced riding with these three kinds of drivers and I
like riding with the third one.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#23:1>
I hope all bus drivers are like him. </p> </I>

<h> Rock of All Kinds </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#25:2>
Arnie Sugay

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#26:2>
I 've been a fan of Rock music all my life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#27:2>
As a matter of fact I 'm a rock band member when I was in High
School.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#28:2>
Rock has its many branches, the different types of rock based on
their sound and tempo or speed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#29:2>
As I classify them, there are four types of rock.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#30:2>
The first one is the ever famous Rock and Roll.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#31:2>
Rock and Roll is a bit faster compared to other types of rock music.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#32:2>
The sounds of distorted guitars and fast drumbeats are dominant.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#33:2>
Some examples of rock and roll artist are Mike Hanopol and the band
behind the hit song <mention> &ldquo; <indig> Sabado </indig> Nights &rdquo;
</mention> , <mention> Rizal Underground </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#34:2>
The second one is Alternative Rock.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#35:2>
It sounds similar to rock and roll only the guitars are louder and
very much distorted.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#36:2>
Alternative Rock can be slow or fast depending on the artist.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#37:2>
The very big difference between Rock and Roll and Alternative Rock is
the latter is much noisier.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#38:2>
In the Philippines, one famous alternative rock band is the band
known as <mention> Wolfgang </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#39:2>
The third one is the Blues.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#40:2>
The sound of the Blues is quite amusing.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#41:2>
Guitars are plain and not distorted and the drumbeat follows a
definite pattern.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#42:2>
Blues are commonly faster than average.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#43:2>
The legendary Freddie Aguilar is an example of Blues and Folk artist.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#44:2>
The last and most popular to the youth is the Pop Rock.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#45:2>
It is sometimes slow or fast.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#46:2>
Pop Rock artists have the choice to use distorted guitars or not.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#47:2>
Commonly they use combinations of plain and distorted guitars.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#48:2>
A very famous Pop Rock band is <mention> The Eraserheads </mention>
known for their unique kind of music. </p> </I>

<h> Commuters in Traffic </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#50:3>
Sonny Francis Cubillo

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#51:3>
Traffic is a part of commuters everyday life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#52:3>
We Filipinos being known to easily adapt to any situation have
devised ways in which how to spend time in traffic.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#53:3>
Each one capable of devising ways of spending their time in traffic.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#54:3>
There are four classification of commuters according to the way
they spend their time in traffic: Sleepers, Chatters, Grumblers and Workers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#55:3>
The sleepers are those who spend their time sleeping in the vehicle.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#56:3>
Sleeping is a way in which they can rest a bit and at the same time
gain energy from it.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#57:3>
This is also a way to relieve oneself of boredom.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#58:3>
The chatters are those who spend their time talking either to the
driver or their seatmates.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#59:3>
Chatters usually start a conversation by giving comments on the
traffic problem in the country.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#60:3>
Then the chatting goes on to many different subjects until they reach
their destination.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#61:3>
Conversing with others is a good way of ridding oneself boredom and
it gives one a chance to meet other people.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#62:3>
Grumblers are characterized as those who spend their time complaining
and showing a grouchy face.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#63:3>
These type usually had a bad day and therefore puts all his anger on
the traffic.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#64:3>
They don't want to be disturbed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#65:3>
They get mad easily at anything.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#66:3>
No one wants or dares to sit beside a grumbler.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#67:3>
Well probably the best way in spending their time in traffic are the
ways in which a worker does.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#68:3>
Workers are those who spend their time by doing worthwhile things
like studying, finishing their office work or sometimes cross-stitching.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#69:3>
Workers are able to make good of the wasted time in traffic.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#70:3>
Though reading is a good way of spending wasted time, this practice
is harmful to the eye for reading in a moving transportation is bad for the
eye.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#71:3>
Still for me it 's still best to spend time in traffic this way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#72:3>
Traffic is a part of everyday life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#73:3>
Whether we like it or not we have to do something or spend our time
in boredom and a time in boredom is like eternity.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#74:4>
<h> Different Strokes </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#75:4>
Jorge L. de Jesus II

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#76:4>
In the Olympics or in any type of sports organization, various
types of sporting events have always been held.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#77:4>
There are the ever present running events, throwing events, field
events, team sports such as basketball and volleyball.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#78:4>
But one of my most favored events is the swimming event. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#79:4>
Through the years four different types of strokes have been used
in the Olympics which vary in speed and are as follows: the breast stroke,
the back stroke, the freestyle, and the butterfly.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#80:4>
The breaststroke is the slowest among the four types.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#81:4>
This stroke is very slow, compared to the others, for the reason that
one has to fully submerge the whole body to execute the propelling motion and
raise the body afterwards in order to gain momentum.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#82:4>
The next one is the back stroke.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#83:4>
This is faster than the breast stroke because one doesn't have to
submerge and raise the body from the water, but rather propel oneself forward
in a lying position.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#84:4>
The freestyle is rather faster than the backstroke.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#85:4>
The swimmer in this manner would have to swim with the belly facing
the water and propel oneself.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#86:4>
This is much easier and can be done with greater power and speed
compared to the first two strokes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#87:4>
The butterfly is the fastest one, but it is much harder to execute.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#88:4>
This stroke requires a lot of flexibility and strength on both arms,
because one would have to use them simultaneously.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#89:4>
By using both arms and with the correct body movements, speed can be
maximized. </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#90:5>
<h> Cab Drivers </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#91:5>
Rex Edward M. Deya

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#92:5>
We ride the cab whenever we 're in a hurry.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#93:5>
Everytime we ride a cab we meet a new person, the cab driver himself.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#94:5>
And sometimes we talk to them or remain silent at all.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#95:5>
But what bothers me at all is that I have encountered the 4 types of
cab drivers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#96:5>
The first is the reckless driver, he takes the road as if it is his
and that 's what I 'm afraid of because I have a phobia on too much speed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#97:5>
Maybe the drivers attitude maybe seen on the way he drives or cares
for his passengers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#98:5>
The second type are the dishonest cab drivers because they are
tampering the cab meter just to get enough out of you.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#99:5>
These kind of cab drivers should be sent to jail or something so that
they may learn their lesson and never cheat again.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#100:5>
Cab drivers should be friendly because I hate rude drivers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#101:5>
The third type of cab drivers are the rude ones.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#102:5>
I 'm scared whenever I learn that my cab driver is rude.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#103:5>
I 'm scared on the way he looks to me and to other people.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#104:5>
And whenever you start a simple conversation with him his reply
would be--looking at you saying that <quote> &ldquo; you get the message.
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#105:5>
The fourth type are the honest ones.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#106:5>
They are the rarest breeds among the four.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#107:5>
They tell jokes and everything.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#108:5>
These people are dedicated to their jobs.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#109:5>
Their main goal is to help people get to their destination.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#110:5>
They need money and they are getting it in a nice way while others
cheat just to get more money.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#111:5>
These drivers are friendly, courteous, and most of all not reckless.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#112:5>
So whenever you take the cab distinguish first if he is your type of
driver. </p> </I>

<h> Dressing Up inside a Mall </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#114:6>
Ronaldo L. Guevara

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#115:6>
The way you dress up inside a mall tells something about your
purpose for going there.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#116:6>
Try sitting on a bench for some time and you would probably be able
to distinguish a few types of dressers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#117:6>
The most obvious type of dressers is the one who wears a
uniform.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#118:6>
This could be a salesperson, a security guard, an officeworker, or a
student.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#119:6>
One could usually see from the person 's face that he/she is not
content about the clothes he/she wears.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#120:6>
If given a choice on what to wear, this person would wear something
more comfortable than the starched and ironed prison that he/she has worn.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#121:6>
On the opposite end is the person who wears very fresh attire:
walking shorts, <indig> sando </indig> , slippers, maybe even a cap or
sunglasses.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#122:6>
This person looks as if he/she has gone to the mall straight out of
bed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#123:6>
This person is usually from a neighboring village, and he/she went
there to escape the noontime heat.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#124:6>
This same person vanishes as soon as the sun goes down. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#125:6>
Another easily distinguishable dresser is the hip-hop.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#126:6>
This person is usually male and wears clothes five sizes bigger than
normal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#127:6>
His pants are big and baggy, while his t-shirt could pass for a one
piece dress.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#128:6>
He often wears a bandanna or a bonnet around his head, and wears
boots or rubber shoes.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#129:6>
He often hangs out with others of his kind, talking with them on a
bench that they claimed as his own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#130:6>
There is a type of person who wears black everything, even
though he/she doesn't seem to be mourning.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#131:6>
The person is also usually male, but he sports long hair.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#132:6>
Together with his attire are torn pants, heavy boots, and silver
chains around his neck.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#133:6>
He often hangs out in musical equipment shops and avoids the
hip-hop, who is his sworn enemy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#134:6>
Finally, there is the simple casual dresser.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#135:6>
He/she wears blue jeans, a t-shirt, and loafers/ <foreign>
espadrilles </foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#136:6>
This person is usually a mere passerby, and passes through the mall
every single day.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#137:6>
He/she ducks into a store or two along the way, but usually emerges
without a shopping bag.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#138:6>
As soon as this person satisfies his/her curiosity, he/she continues
home. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#139:6>
It 's often quite amusing to observe people and the way they
dress.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#140:6>
As an old proverb says, <quote> the way a person dresses reflects
his or her personality. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#141:6>
That could be right.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#142:6>
However, another proverb tells us <quote> not to judge a book by its
cover. </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#143:6>
Which one should we heed? </p> </I>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#144:7>
<h> Guitar Amplifiers </h>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#145:7>
Ario Ubando

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#146:7>
I love to play my electric guitar.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#147:7>
Sometimes I play blues, sometimes heavy metal, and sometimes punk
rock.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#148:7>
But my problem is I can't get to the right kind of sound that I want
to produce.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#149:7>
My amplifier can't produce the sound that I want, so it 's very
frustrating for me.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#150:7>
However, there are three famous guitar amplifiers that are best for
each kind of sound.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#151:7>
The Fender amplifier is best for clean tone.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#152:7>
Most blues players and jazz players use Fender amp. <&> =amplifier
</&> because it gives a clearer and bolder sound of the guitar.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#153:7>
They are able to produce bold sound of strings that Fender can only
provide.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#154:7>
The Marshall amplifier is best for distorted sound that most heavy
metal bands use.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#155:7>
The Marshall amp. <&> =amplifier </&> is known for its heaviness
when it comes to distorted music.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#156:7>
It gives the player a wide variety of distorted sound that they can
choose from.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#157:7>
The Peavy amplifier is best for punk rock music because it gives the
passive sound and the crunchiness that punks use. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-012#158:7>
These are the kinds of guitar amplifiers that best suit for
blues, heavy metal, and punk rock. </p> </I>
