Thank you Prof Bala for that generous introduction
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#2:1:A>
I was beginning to wonder <,> if I recognized myself from that introduction <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#3:1:A>
Dr Sibayan Sir <,> greetings again and a happy birthday may you have many many more
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#5:1:A>
Mrs Sibayan and family <,> Bro Andrew <,> officers of administration and faculty of De La Salle University <,> fellow members of the Linguistic Society of the Philippines <,> donors <,> of the Chair <,> staff of the uh S I L <,> my Commander-in-Chief Colonel Ravina who is there <,> <O> laughter </O> who said he was going to stay away this afternoon <,> to spare me my nerves <O> laughter </O> and who had granted me all the space for my professional growth my one and only sister and sibling <.> sis </.> sibling and best friend Dr Purificacion Valera Quisumbing <,> colleagues <,> friends <,> one and all <,> good afternoon <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#7:1:A>
I hope this paper is going to answer one question that uh Dr Bautista here asked me not so very long ago <,> with all of that <,> which Nita enumerated she asked me where do you get time to do any research <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#9:1:A>
I have not given you my full text
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#10:1:A>
I have given you only <,> some sheets that will be central to my paper and to which I will refer you can follow follow me every now and then <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#11:1:A>
When pressed for a title I took one week to play around with many possibilities and when the deadline was on me I had to dish out what you have there <mention> Interlanguage and Error Analysis Revisited </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#12:1:A>
But it is most apropos <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#13:1:A>
Schumann in nineteen seventy-five proposed three variables in the growing interest on second language acquisition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#14:1:A>
These are the <mention> why </mention> the <mention> how </mention> and the <mention> what </mention> of the learner
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#15:1:A>
The <mention> why </mention> consists of the affective variables that can be seen as initiators of second language learning and to which to a large degree regulate the extent of the learning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#16:1:A>
The <mention> how </mention> are the cognitive operations that the learner performs on the target language input data
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#17:1:A>
The what referred to as the linguistics product are the linguistic results of the operations in terms of the particular grammatical forms the learner uses when he attempts to speak the target language <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#18:1:A>
Uh much earlier the first uh time I encountered this uh theory uh it was presented in three boxes with the <mention> why </mention> as the first box going into the second box which is the <mention> how </mention> and into the third box which is the <mention> what </mention> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#19:1:A>
A little earlier than Schumann 's proposal <,> Selinker at an international conference in the late nineteen <.> sixties </.> nineteen sixty-nine introduced the notion of interlanguage
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#20:1:A>
And may I refer you to the first sheet there with the three circles <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#21:1:A>
He later pursued this concept of interlanguage along with a new look at errors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#22:1:A>
The term <mention> interlanguage </mention> is referred to by other names depending upon the viewpoint of the investigation of language learning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#23:1:A>
It is called approximative system by Nemser and transitional language by Corder <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#24:1:A>
If the investigation is viewed as developmental therefore dynamic it is called approximative system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#25:1:A>
Uh you have the other figure there <,> which is linear <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#26:1:A>
In the view if the view is of a particular point in time in a continuum it is more often called transitional language
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#27:1:A>
On the whole however the general term is <mention> interlanguage </mention> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#28:1:A>
Now you can see that in that first that first circle there is supposed to be the native language of the learner <,> with its own rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#29:1:A>
And the third circle <,> which I which is language two or the target language also has its own rules
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#30:1:A>
Now the circle in the middle which is the interlanguage is the uh circle I am I have sourced my uh data <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#31:1:A>
It is <,> that which has fascinated me for <,> more than a decade
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#32:1:A>
This paper revisits the interlanguage of a group of Filipino professionals
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#33:1:A>
It looks more closely at the <mention> what </mention> of the language user meaning the linguistic product of this group
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#34:1:A>
To do this in some detail and to arrive at an interpretation of why it is what it is the companion hypothesis called the new error analysis by Richards as well as by Selinker is here operationalized <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#35:1:A>
This interlanguage refers to a separate linguistic system whose existence we are compelled to hypothesize based upon the observed output which results from the second language <w> learners' </w> attempted production of a target language norm
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#36:1:A>
It is a dynamic product of a psycholinguistic system
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#37:1:A>
Along with this dynamic view Selinker further expounded the notion of fossilization which he characterizes as a mechanism whereby speakers of a particular native language will keep certain linguistic items rules subsystems in the interlanguage no matter what amount of instruction they receive in the language two <,> target language <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#38:1:A>
Related to this notion of fossilization is that of backsliding called regression which refers to the regular reappearance or reemergence in interlanguage productive performance of linguistic structures which were thought to be eradicated
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#39:1:A>
This he called an interlanguage norm not the interlanguage norm <,> the reason being that an interlanguage norm refers to an individual learner 's development and not to an institutionalized code of a language community
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#41:1:A>
Uh may I add here that when this I L theory first appeared <,> and was tried out it was best found to work uh with individual learners
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#42:1:A>
When I used this <,> for my dissertation I uhm thought perhaps that even if it were best to work for an individual learner 's uh language two <,> and because of course I was having problems with my uh teaching and uh hunting witch-hunting for errors I thought perhaps that trying out this uh theory this hypothesis I would be able to come to some kind of a direction that would be not necessarily the interlanguage norm of Filipino uh speakers of English but at least some kind of a norm especially for my students
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#43:1:A>
Without having to say here definitely that the data here is an institunal institutionalized code of the Filipino adult professional I posit however that the language investigation can establish some <.> lang </.> common language characteristics of the Filipino bilingual professional who has not attained near-native professional proficiency
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#44:1:A>
And that is where I uhm <,> I have culled <,> my latest uh collection of these so-called errors which uh you also have in your handout <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#45:1:A>
Uh I have I will end this paper with a question of which I do not have an answer but which I think maybe you will help me provide an answer in due time
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#46:1:A>
The next time around uh the first time I tested this hypothesis was for my dissertation <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#47:1:A>
I collected data from the written works of sophomore students at U P Diliman who were taking their last G E English course <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#48:1:A>
Three sets of compositions from each student subject were examined
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#49:1:A>
A total of about two hundred twenty-five compositions were corrected by three professors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#50:1:A>
The deviances or mistakes or lapses were identified and examined collected and classified according to a scheme suggested by Selinker and Richards <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#51:1:A>
The next time around that I <.> ex </.> tested this hypothesis was with a sampling of college teachers across disciplines in some selected state colleges and universities around the country
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#52:1:A>
The findings of the first research were confirmed by those of the second and they seemed to hold in my present research <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#53:1:A>
The subjects the subjects of this research are adult professionals also from different disciplines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#54:1:A>
An added dimension to my earlier conclusions and insights had posed a question about the Filipino bilingual professional
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#55:1:A>
That I will ask at the end of this report
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#56:1:A>
Let me postulate that when a non-native speaker of English like the Fini Filipino adult in this study learns English as a second language
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#57:1:A>
May I uh refer you to that line there where you have the beginning of the line <mention> the learner <,> one uh uhm language the native language speaker with L one </mention> and the end of that line <mention> the speaker of the <.> tar </.> target language </mention> excuse me who is which is English in our case <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#58:1:A>
Uhm so he moves through a series of intermediate stages in between his native language at one end and English at the other end
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#60:1:A>
This assumes that these stages are necessary way stations <,> which the learner traverses if he expects to make progress <,> in achieving proficiency and competence hopefully in the target language <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#61:1:A>
Errors are characteristics of these way stations <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#62:1:A>
And they are the ones that have fascinated me all of these <,> years
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#63:1:A>
Error analysis used to examine identified lapses deviances of the adult professional subjects is not new as we teachers have engaged in it <,> for all our professional lives
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#64:1:A>
But there is a significant difference between the old and the new and that 's the one that is intriguing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#65:1:A>
It 's a little bit difficult because you just don't count uh the uh occurrences of these deviances and assign numerical uh grades to them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#66:1:A>
And from my experience before I encountered this hypothesis just like everybody else and I think that that is exactly what 's still happening the more deviances mistakes you call errors <,> the better for a grade for for a grade of five meaning uh failure <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#67:1:A>
That 's what I called witch-hunting then <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#68:1:A>
But my outlook has changed drastically since <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#69:1:A>
Uhm I even say that I have become more human in my teaching and in my outlook at errors since I encountered this uhm theory <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#70:1:A>
The old error analysis looked at errors and classified them on a superficial basis <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#71:1:A>
Linguistic items were either omitted <,> added <,> substituted or reordered in spelling in grammar or in diction <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#72:1:A>
And I have a table there <,> the third one the third figure which shows which gives you a matrix of what we used to do or what we what most of us are still wont to do <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#73:1:A>
These were labeled as such and accounted for <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#74:1:A>
The total number of occurrences were assigned percentages
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#75:1:A>
The new look at errors was based <,> on the C A theory <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#76:1:A>
The contrastive analysis theory by the way attempted at describing a language with all its features and then comparing these with a target language equally and thoroughly described
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#77:1:A>
Later it began to look like an impractical and formidalble <&> mispronounced the word </&> formidable task
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#78:1:A>
Meanwhile the seeming <.> impracticality or impracticability and formidability of the task showed the contrastive <w> analysis' </w> inadequacy at predicting and <.> im </.> explaining all <w> learners' </w> errors
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#79:1:A>
The strong version of this theory states that one could predict and describe the patterns that will cause difficulty in learning and those that will not cause difficulty
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#80:1:A>
This eventually could not however be sustained to determine competence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#81:1:A>
And that is when the interlanguage theory and hypothesis came to being
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#82:1:A>
Hence the introduction of the I L hypothesis and theory that refers to a system whose existence we are compelled to hypothesize based on the evidence of the language <O> cough </O> that the speaker-user is using
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#83:1:A>
Meaning that which he has learned at a particular point in the course or in time and keep looking I keep uh inviting you to look at that line there which I said earlier uh is a line through which the learner traverses as he tries to attain proficiency and competence in the second language <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#84:1:A>
The new error analysis is said to be more adequate for judging <,> not only performance but more importantly competence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#85:1:A>
That 's the old error analysis uh including that of the uh that was based on the contrastive analysis was said to be best to judge only performance and not competence and Selinker with his I L had proffered the uh advantage of the new error analysis <.> hypothes </.> uh error analysis which is best to gauge competence <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#86:1:A>
The new error analysis is said to be more adequate for judging not only performance as I said earlier but more importantly competence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#87:1:A>
It takes off from the old by interpreting the errors from the viewpoint of knowledge of the language not knowledge about the language
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#88:1:A>
In the end the theories of both psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics enter into the judging or the decision-making on whether a sentence or an utterance is error-free or erroneous
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#89:1:A>
Now you can see how it can be a little bit tedious to engage in this new error analysis hypothesis because there are certain assumptions from language acquisition as well as from sociology <.> psycholing </.> sociolinguistics that one has to have on hand or to be familiar about if he has to be able to make all the necessary inferences to judge the degree of erroneous uh of the erroneous sentences degree of errors <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#90:1:A>
This new look at errors is a natural adjunct on second language acquisition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#91:1:A>
It yields not only performance analysis but also error sources to gauge degree of competence
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-030#92:1:A>
Thus the questions to put each superficially well-formed sentence through are shown in figure four
