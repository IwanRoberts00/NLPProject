<h> <bold> Adding the color of new life to the art of dyeing </bold>
</h>

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#2:1>
<bold> By Cecile G. Garcia </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#3:1>
<bold> ONLY </bold> Luis Agaid, it is said, knows the art of
natural dyeing in the entire province of Abra. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#4:1>
<indig> Mang </indig> Luis does not look like he possesses special
knowledge.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#5:1>
He is 56, short, dark and angular, with most of his teeth gone, his
hair unkempt, his feet shod in rubber thongs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#6:1>
He is a true Itneg, but he considers himself a Tingguian and traces
his ancestry to that tribal group. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#7:1>
The Agaids, <indig> Mang </indig> Luis says, are a distinguished
family.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#8:1>
His forefathers were weavers.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#9:1>
They also had knowledge of natural coloring agents, and this knowledge
is their legacy to <indig> Mang </indig> Luis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#10:1>
<indig> Mang </indig> Luis ' craft is fast becoming obsolete.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#11:1>
In Abra and in other parts of the country, synthetic dyes are readily
available, easy to use and widely accepted despite their prohibitive cost.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#12:1>
This is a cause of concern, cautions Zenaida de Guzman, chief of
research and development division of the Philippine Textile Research
Institute ( PTRI).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#13:1>
PTRI has been studying natural dyes since 1984, and De Guzman started
the national research and development program on these products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#14:1>
Meanwhile, because of her involvement in traditional handicraft,
Patis Tesoro of the <indig> Katutubong Filipino </indig> Foundation Inc. (
KFF), has long been acquainted with <indig> Mang </indig> Luis.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#15:1>
Tesoro would travel all the way to Abra now and then to buy
hand-woven goods from him.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#16:1>
Prodded by her friend Tweetums Gonzales, who was once president of
Coca-Cola Phil., Tesoro was drawn to the idea of revitalizing the natural dye
industry and rekindling interest in it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#17:1>
In 1993, KFF launched the <indig> Katutubong Kulay </indig>
Project ( KKP) with Tesoro and Gonzales as chief coordinators.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#18:1>
Tesoro 's ties with PTRI ( an off-shoot of her trade) easily paved
the way for getting the institute to participate in the project.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#19:1>
Financing could have been a problem, but the Coca-Cola Foundation
agreed to be the funding agency for KKP.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#20:1>
When the office of the provincial governor of Abra and the Abra State
Institute of Science & Technology ( Asist) consented to take part, the
picture became complete. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#21:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Our concerted effort, &rdquo; </quote> says De
Guzman, <quote> &ldquo; is geared towards revising and promoting the art of
natural dyeing.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#22:1>
PTRI hopes to develop and standardize production technology and to
transfer this technology to interested parties, particularly for commercial
purposes. &rdquo; <quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#23:1>
Last month, De Guzman conducted the first seminar-workshop in
Bangued, Abra, on the improved method of natural dye extraction and its
application.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#24:1>
KKP, she says, is looking forward to making Abra the natural dye
capital of the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#25:1>
Why Abra?

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#26:1>
Because the province is remarkably rich in natural dye sources - -
and because of <indig> Mang </indig> Luis ' heritage which is as old as the
emerald mountains of Abra. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#27:1>
In <indig> Barangay </indig> Namarabar in the town of Pennarubia,
<indig> Mang </indig> Luis tends to a nursery of natural dye yielding plants.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#28:1>
The nursery is the only one of its kind in all of Abra.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#29:1>
<indig> Mang </indig> Luis receives financial assistance from KKP to
keep it going.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#30:1>
During the wet season when the roads are impassable and shallow
rivers are pools of dense mud, Namarabar is inaccessible except by a hanging
bridge that, though it seems endless, is about a hundred meters long.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#31:1>
The hanging bridge is old and rickety, the wood and bamboo planks
splintered and decaying here and there.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#32:1>
When the weather is rough, crossing this improvised contraption is
about as cozy as a ride on a two-seater glider. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#33:1>
Namarabar is clearly <indig> Mang </indig> Luis ' domain.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#34:1>
Here, he lives with his family.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#35:1>
While his wife weaves, his four children embroider finished products,
using the <indig> Kimayan </indig> technique which is indigenous to Abra and
to the entire Ilocos region.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#36:1>
<indig> Kimayan </indig> is unique because it is two-sided, or
reversible.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#37:1>
In his backyard, <indig> Mang </indig> Luis experiments with the
alchemy of colors, a tantalizing task he is reluctant to pass on or
surrender. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#38:1>
De Guzman says about 17 natural dye yielding plants can be found
in Abra.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#39:1>
Of these, 13 have been verified.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#40:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Verification means there are literature confirming
that certain plants produce certain colors, &rdquo; </quote> she explains.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#41:1>
<quote> &ldquo; But the literature can be so old that the same colors
cannot be reproduced. &rdquo; </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#42:1>
Natural dyes are not always the same hue or shade as their
origin.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#43:1>
But there are some exceptions such as the everyday <foreign> <it>
achuete </it> </foreign> which spawns red or yellow-orange and, of course,
wild ginger or <indig> <it> dilaw </it> </indig> which, expectedly, spawns
yellow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#44:1>
We are told that Abra possesses an eclectic bounty of plants and
trees that could be sources of every color imaginable.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#45:1>
Most have strange names such as <indig> <it> binunga </it> </indig> ,
<indig> <it> sapang </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> tayum </it> </indig> ,
<indig> <it> tekla </it> </indig> , <indig> <it> katuray </it> </indig> and
<indig> <it> bunga </it> </indig> which we believe is betel nut.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#46:1>
More familiar ones are mahogany and the majestic <foreign> narra
</foreign> .

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#47:1>
Less exotic though no less high-grade sources are the lowly <indig>
<it> malunggay </it> </indig> , the prosaic tamarind, <indig> <it> kamachile
</it> </indig> and guava.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#48:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There is a natural color pigment within the plant
itself, &rdquo; </quote> De Guzman explains.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#49:1>
This pigment may be found in leaves, barks, roots, fruits, trunks or
stems.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#50:1>
Natural colors, she says, are virgin and pure and monochromatic,
ranging from the deepest to the lightest shade.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#51:1>
In contrast, synthetic colors are nearly always a combination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#52:1>
The bane of <indig> Mang </indig> Luis, observes De Guzman, is
the improbability - - nay, impossibility - - of reproducing a specific
desired color.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#53:1>
Little else is more frustrating in the traditional method of dyeing
which De Guzman refers to as <mention> <indig> <it> sawsaw-alis </it>
</indig> </mention> , tantamount to trial and error or hit or miss. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#54:1>
In lieu of scientific technology, <quote> &ldquo; it 's <indig>
<it> tantsahan </it> </indig> , &rdquo; </quote> De Guzman adds.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#55:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There is no uniformity in color or shade.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#56:1>
You can't repeat the color because you can't recall the process.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#57:1>
The quality is not consistent and the color fades or runs.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#58:1>
We would like <indig> Mang </indig> Luis and others like him to learn
a better way of doing what they already know.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#59:1>
What we have put together is actually a 'cooking recipe.'" </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#60:1>
But <indig> Mang </indig> Luis, seemingly as stubborn as the
famed horses of Abra, is resistant to change which is not surprising because
any kind of change can be frightening.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#61:1>
Still, he attended last month 's workshop, with 40 other participants
who were mostly weavers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#62:1>
Basically, there is nothing wrong with <indig> Mang </indig> Luis '
system of dye extraction and application, which he claims has been handed
down from one generation to the next. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#63:1>
Just as when he was still a small boy, <indig> Mang </indig> Luis
begins by gathering raw materials for natural dyes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#64:1>
Branches, barks and roots are cut or pounded, while pods, leaves and
seeds are left as they are.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#65:1>
These are boiled for three hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#66:1>
This is followed by decanting - - collecting the dye extract and
transferring it into another container. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#67:1>
Decanting, says De Guzman, is not wise because it leaves
impurities in the extract which could hinder its effectiveness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#68:1>
<indig> <it> Sukang Iloko </it> </indig> is customarily added to
the solution and the yarns are soaked in it for 15 days.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#69:1>
<indig> Mang </indig> Luis is not aware that soaking the yarns
actually weakens them.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#70:1>
After two weeks, the dyed yarns are squeezed, wrung and sundried,
rinsed once, squeezed and wrung once again, and allowed to dry in the sun for
the last time.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#71:1>
The yarns are now ready for weaving. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#72:1>
PTRI 's method may not be a complete departure from the
traditional, but it is definitely more precise.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#73:1>
Amounts of the dye source, water and other ingredients are measured
in correct proportions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#74:1>
For more efficient dye extraction, PTRI recommends chopping the
sources very finely or grinding them, except for the seeds and pods.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#75:1>
The prescribed period for boiling is three hours, after which the
extract is filtered using <indig> <it> katsa </it> </indig> or cheesecloth so
that the liquid is clear and free from impurities.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#76:1>
One important step <indig> Mang </indig> Luis overlooks is the
pre-treatment of yarns, or cleaning the yarns in preparation for dyeing them.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#77:1>
For cotton yarns the process requires mixing proportionate
measures of Teepol detergent, sodium silicate, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen
peroxide and water.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#78:1>
The yarns are boiled in the mixture for 30 minutes, removed, washed
with warm water twice, rinsed thoroughly and air-dried. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#79:1>
Silk yarns seem more demanding.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#80:1>
Instead of Teepol, grated Perla soap is used to which soda ash,
sodium hydrosulfite, acetic acid solution and water are added.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#81:1>
This time, the silk yarns are allowed to boil for two and a half
hours.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#82:1>
Afterwards, they 're washed in warm water six times and in cold water
twice.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#83:1>
They are then soaked in acetic acid solution for 15 minutes, rinsed
very well and also air-dried. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#84:1>
Mordanting is as necessary as pre-treatment.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#85:1>
Mordants are merely binding agents which make the yarns more
receptive to the dye.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#86:1>
Not at all esoteric, this solution is nothing more than water and
treated copper sulfate, used very sparingly.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#87:1>
The pre-treated yarns are completely immersed in the mordant for 30
minutes.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#88:1>
They 're then set aside to cool and squeezed after some time.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#89:1>
Lastly, they are air-dried without rinsing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#90:1>
The dyeing process itself is brief.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#91:1>
It 's not chancy or skittish.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#92:1>
The yarns that have been pre-treated and mordanted are placed in a
pot or with the liquid dye extract and boiled for two hours, stirring at
frequent intervals.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#93:1>
When they are cooked, the yarns are removed and squeezed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#94:1>
They are washed very well before soaping and cleaning with Teepol
solution ( water and a little of the detergent).

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#95:1>
Finally, the dyed yarns are rinsed once more and left to dry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#96:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Because of mordanting, soaping and thorough
rinsing, &rdquo; </quote> says De Guzman, <quote> &ldquo; the dyed material
is color-fast and stronger.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#97:1>
It is also less prone to breakage because of pre-treatment.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#98:1>
Most important, the colors can be reproduced. &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#99:1>
And the PTRI method saves time.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#100:1>
What takes <indig> Mang </indig> Luis 15 days can be done in one
single day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#101:1>
PTRI has gone several steps ahead.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#102:1>
Natural dye can be powderized and they have done it.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#103:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The technology is there, &rdquo; </quote> says De
Guzman.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#104:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We have always wanted to do it but could not due to
lack of funds.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#105:1>
The Coca-Cola Foundation through KKP is helping us with that.
&rdquo; </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#106:1>
For all the praises that can be sung to it, the technology seems
too sophisticated and may be transferred only to those who have the
appropriate background or knowledge.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#107:1>
In Abra, it will be transferred to Asist where a &peso;300,000 pilot
plant will be built next year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#108:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We already have a machine that can convert any
dye source into powder form, &rdquo; </quote> De Guzman says.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#109:1>
Called a spray dryer, it could well be any weaver 's or manufacturer 's
dream come true. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#110:1>
The advantages of advanced technology are glaringly obvious.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#111:1>
<indig> Mang </indig> Luis and others in far-flung rural areas could
go to Asist anytime and have their dye sources powderized for a minimum fee.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#112:1>
De Guzman says it 's a way of sustaining the traditional dyeing
method without the hassle, the tediousness.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#113:1>
<quote> &ldquo; We are simplifying it, &rdquo; </quote> she says.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#114:1>
<quote> &ldquo; The spray dryer hastens the process. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#115:1>
Just as carrying sacks or bagfuls of roots, barks, leaves or
stems is troublesome, what can be less so and more practical than having
those in powder form packed away in handy small parcels? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#116:1>
Furthermore, powderized dye has a longer shelf life.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#117:1>
Because PTRI is looking at the international picture, could there be
better news? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#118:1>
<quote> &ldquo; There is a growing demand for hand-woven,
naturally-dyed fabrics or goods, &rdquo; </quote> says De Guzman.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#119:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Synthetic dyes and chemicals can be carcinogenic to
those handling them directly and can cause allergy to the user. &rdquo;
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#120:1>
It would seem the developments in Abra are well-timed.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#121:1>
Realizing the potential and encouraged by KKP and PRTI, Gov. Vicente
Valdez has asked his wife Ching to initiate the cultivation of backyard
nurseries in every <indig> barangay </indig> in all 27 municipalities.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#122:1>
The idea is to have natural dye plants in every backyard, if
possible.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#123:1>
Right now, KKP is considering setting up a nursery at Asist, thus
increasing the supply which at the moment is the monopoly of <indig> Mang
</indig> Luis in Pennarubia. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#124:1>
In a sense, growing these plants could be another aspect of
farming which remains the main source of livelihood in this lovely landlocked
province which happens to the largest in the Cordilleras. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#125:1>
Rice and corn are the principal crops, vegetables and tobacco
tailing.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#126:1>
Surprisingly weaving, which is tied up with natural dyes, serves
only to augment the family income. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#127:1>
De Guzman says they foresee a positive change.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#128:1>
With technology transfer, the industry could be improved.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#129:1>
The success of the workshop is, of course, inspiring.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#130:1>
At first resistant <indig> Mang </indig> Luis is now more open and
willing to adopt new ways. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#131:1>
What <indig> Mang </indig> Luis and his ilk have been doing for
scores and score of years is now gaining worldwide acceptance and
recognition.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#132:1>
&ldquo; Naturals &rdquo; are the current trend.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#133:1>
The enthusiastic crowds at the British-based Body Shop which
recently opened on outlet at the Glorietta in Makati, are proof of this.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#134:1>
So is the huge success in the United States of establishments like
Kiehl 's and Origins.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#135:1>
All three carry natural beauty and skin and hair care products. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#136:1>
De Guzman stresses that natural is compatible with natural.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#137:1>
That 's why natural dyes work best with cotton, silk and wool.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#138:1>
The weavers in Abra, by the way, get their cotton yarns from Manila
and silk from Bulacan.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#139:1>
De Guzman looks farther and sees the promise the industry holds.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#140:1>
Someday, we may be able to use Abra produce for coloring our
hair instead of Clairol or <foreign> L'Oreal </foreign> ( think of <foreign>
henna </foreign> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#141:1>
By next year, a book on natural dyes may be published, with the
help of the Coca-Cola Foundation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#142:1>
With the confluence of favorable events, it 's not difficult to
imagine Abra being no longer &ldquo; forgotten &rdquo; or neglected.

<ICE-PHI:W2D-020#143:1>
In fact, it could indeed be our natural dye capital, with <indig>
Mang </indig> Luis at the forefront grinning sheepishly finally and
irrevocably won over. </p> </I>
