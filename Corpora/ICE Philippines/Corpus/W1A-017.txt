</mention> and <mention> <it> The Prisoner of Zenda </it> </mention> ( you
can make references to both literary and film version) in relation to

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#X2:1>
a. the concept of the hero

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#X3:1>

2. What type of adaptation was used in <mention> <it> Age of
Innocence </it> </mention> ?

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#X6:1>
Make specific references from the texts. </X>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#7:1>
1. a. <mention> &ldquo; Clash of the Titans &rdquo; </mention> (
movie) presented Perseus as a ready-made hero.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#8:1>
He takes on the adventure willingly and performs his heroic deeds
well.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#9:1>
Although in its written form he had different reasons in taking on the
challenge.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#10:1>
<mention> &ldquo; Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; </mention> ( movie)
presented Rasendyll as a reluctant hero.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#11:1>
His reasons for entering the adventure was the same as in the novel.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#12:1>
But his make-up as a hero is different.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#13:1>
In the novel, he learns how to be a hero even though he wasn't one in
the start.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#14:1>
But in the novel, he might have been reluctant but he approved to be
a closeted hero.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#15:1>
He didn't learn to be anything in the film. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#16:1>
b. <mention> &ldquo; Clash of the Titans &rdquo; </mention> (
movie) in its adventure plot had all the monsters that would sell well.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#17:1>
However, the journey Perseus took was for the love of Andromeda,
which was not the case in its written form.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#18:1>
<mention> &ldquo; The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; </mention> ( movie)
meanwhile, Rasendyll took on the adventure because he felt it was his duty.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#19:1>
It 's the same thing in the novel.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#20:1>
It also had the mean characters, which could be compared with the
monsters in <mention> &ldquo; Clash of the Titans &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#21:1>
Both defeat the monsters but only Perseus gets the girl for all
eternity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#22:1>
c. In <mention> &ldquo; Clash of the Titans &rdquo; </mention> (
movie & written form) the characters were at the mercy of the gods.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#23:1>
One could only do as much as the gods allow him to.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#24:1>
In <mention> &ldquo; Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; </mention> , fate has
it that Rasendyll looked like the king.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#25:1>
But Rasendyll was free to choose his path and so was Flavia.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#26:1>
They had their free will.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#27:1>
Perseus & Andromeda performed according to their fate and didn't
choose any other path. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#28:1>
2. <mention> &ldquo; Age of Innocence &rdquo; </mention> used
faithful adaptation in transferring the novel into film.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#29:1>
Everything was faithful to every detail.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#30:1>
For example, when Ellen told Archer <delete> that </delete> <quote>
&ldquo; I can not love you unless I give you up" </quote> , it was found in
the movie.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#31:1>
And when Archer told his son <quote> &ldquo; Just tell her I 'm old
fashioned" </quote> , it was also found in the film.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#32:1>
The only minor alterations the film had was the condensation of 2
chapters [ when Archer 's boss gave Archer Ellen 's divorce case] and the
addition of an unseen character as a narrator.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#33:1>
It was done in a voice over but it was still faithful to the text.
</p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#34:2>
1. a. Both Perseus and Rudolf Rassendyll are considered heroes,
though defined by societies delineated from one another by centuries.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#35:2>
Perseus was the conventional Greek hero who, having won the favors of
the gods from the very beginning, was destined to triumph over every obstacle
with the aid of divine intervention; while Rudolf Rassendyll was more of a
chivalric knight, who won over his enemies aided not by any intervention from
any god, but armed only with wit, skill in the battlefield and nobility of
intention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#36:2>
b. Perseus and Rudolf Rassendyll faced obstacles for love and
honor; but while the former battled mythological creatures and monsters for
the love of his life, Rudolf fought the metaphorical green-eyed monster
<mention> jealousy </mention> , together with treachery and greed, to save
the princess Flavia from the fiendish machinations of Black Michael, and for
the restoration of peace and order over all of Ruritania.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#37:2>
Both heroes triumphed, although Perseus enjoyed divine aid from the
very onset of his adventures, whereas Rudolf relied on no god, but on
trustworthy friends alone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#38:2>
c. Fate was present in both stories: Perseus was destined to
triumph over every obstacle with divine aid, whereas Rudolf was fated to be a 'play-acting'
king for a limited span of time for him to learn the value of responsibility.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#39:2>
However, the concept of free will was <ul> most </ul> evident in
<mention> &ldquo; The Prisoner of Zenda. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#40:2>
Rudolf had the choice of keeping the <delete> throne </delete> crown
when the opportunities presented themselves, but being noble in character
<ul> opted </ul> to save the real king even at the expense of his own love
for the princess Flavia.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#41:2>
Perseus had no opportunity to exercise free will, for his life was
already charted out for him, from his birth, subsequent suffering, to
eventual triumph. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#42:2>
2. Basing on Louis Gianetti 's classification of adaptations,
Martin Scorsese used the faithful adaptation in his filmic rendering of the
novel <mention> &ldquo; The Age of Innocence. &rdquo; </mention>

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#43:2>
Aside from the minor intervention of fusing 2 chapters into one
sequence with fluidity, every aspect of the novel was retained: the setting,
the costumes, the characterizations, even the beauty of language. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#44:3>
1. a. In <mention> &ldquo; The Clash of the Titans &rdquo;
</mention> the hero was depicted as one of noble standard; one who was
handsome, strong and of high social stature.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#45:3>
In <mention> &ldquo; The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; </mention> the
hero was a simpleton whose character evolved during the course of the story.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#46:3>
b. <mention> &ldquo; The Clash of the Titans &rdquo; </mention> 's
plot was composed of <delete> a </delete> long journeys, magical elements and
the rescue of a damsel in distress.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#47:3>
In <mention> &ldquo; The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; </mention> the
action and adventure mostly happened within the protagonist, with his journey
from being one kind of person to the others, battling what is right and what
is wrong with himself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#48:3>
c. <mention> &ldquo; The Clash of the Titans &rdquo; </mention>
showed the dominance of the Olympian gods and goddesses over the fate of
humans, with them literally transporting them from one place to another.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#49:3>
<mention> &ldquo; The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; </mention> showed
humans having free will to choose what to do, examples of which being
Rasendyll 's decision to impose as the king, and his decision to leave
everything behind in the end of the story. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#50:3>
2. I would say that <delete> transposition faithful adaptation
</delete> <mention> paraphrasing </mention> was used for <mention> &ldquo;
The Age of Innocence &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#51:3>
Some minor events from the novel were taken out, one example being
how the novel described Newland purchasing May her daily <delete> flo
</delete> daisies but also purchasing Ellen a huge bouquet of yellow roses.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#52:3>
This depicts the slow yet evident change in Newland with regards to
his feelings towards the two ladies.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#53:3>
Yet the film only showed Ellen finding the bouquet of roses.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#54:3>
This scene did show how Newland 's feelings toward Ellen were
changing, yet it did not show how these feelings were surpassing his feelings
for May, which the purchasing of the two very different sets of flowers
showed.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#55:3>
The author 's idea was still presented, though some alterations were
made.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#56:3>
These two types of presentation, though different in several aspects,
both showed the key idea of Newland 's increasing feelings toward Ellen. </p>
</I>


<I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#57:4>
1. a. The hero in the <mention> Prisoner of Zenda </mention> is
somewhat, a part of the <ul> ordinary citizenry </ul> of the country who, due
to unsystematic events with a touch of fate, made him <quote> &ldquo; save
the ass &rdquo; </quote> of the soon-to-be-king.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#58:4>
His role entails great pretensions so as to convince the people that
he truly is the king, and not a fraud.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#59:4>
In this case, there is chivalry shown by the man named <mention>
Rudolf </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#60:4>
In the <mention> Clash of the Titans </mention> , the hero named
<mention> Perseus </mention> is a son of the powerful god - Zeus.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#61:4>
He is therefore part of the ruling class where in most of his
adventures, the gods and goddesses were aiding him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#62:4>
b. Both of the two films have a cause and effect relationship.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#63:4>
Both made use of the constructed plot of the two narratives.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#64:4>
There is the capture of the hero, escape ad adventure of the hero,
journey and triumph in achieving his goal.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#65:4>
Of course, the two films have a conflict, climax, and resolution to
the conflict.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#66:4>
However, in <mention> Clash of the Titans </mention> , happy ending
between Perseus and Andromeda took place.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#67:4>
A sadder ending was shown in <mention> Prisoner of Zenda </mention> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#68:4>
c. Fate has played a very important role in the development of
the two literary works/films.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#69:4>
Fate brought <delete> by </delete> the exact look-alike of Rudolf (
in <mention> Prisoner of Zenda </mention> ) to his mansion where he will
pretend to be the enthroned king.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#70:4>
In <mention> The Clash of the Titans </mention> , the gods dictated
the fate of Andromeda.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#71:4>
Most of what happened to him was caused by his &ldquo; invisible
&rdquo; allies as well as by those who are jealous of him.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#72:4>
Free will is visible in the hero of <mention> Prisoner of Zenda
</mention> when he decided to pretend as the king.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#73:4>
All his actions, though restricted, are controlled by him alone.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#74:4>
The volition of <delete> Cla </delete> Perseus in <mention> Clash of
the Titans </mention> are somewhat not firm.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#75:4>
Due to ignorance ( caused by isolation), he needed to ask for advice
from the more knowledgeable.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#76:4>
But in loving Andromeda, his free will manifested many heroic
actions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#77:4>
2. <mention> Age of Innocence </mention> made use of <mention>
<ul> faithful adaptation </ul> </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#78:4>
Most parts of the novel were shown in the film although some parts
were not included.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#79:4>
However, having not included some parts didn't cause a major
alteration to the story.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#80:4>
An example is the deletion of the setting where a party in the
Minggot 's mansion was taking place.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#81:4>
Some parts were modified like when Archer Newland and Olenska were
having an intense conversation with each other, disclosing their feeling
towards one another.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#82:4>
In the film, the emotions were intense but a sense of exaggeration
was evident. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#83:5>
1. a. Perseus is son of the supreme god Zeus and being so, the
god intervenes in Perseus ' struggles.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#84:5>
Perseus is an ideal Greek hero - - noble, strong, & handsome.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#85:5>
Rasendyll, on the other hand, is more of an &ldquo; accidental
&rdquo; hero.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#86:5>
His incredible physical resemblance to the crown prince initiates his
&ldquo; hero-ship &rdquo; or heroism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#87:5>
b. Perseus is tasked to kill the gorgon Medusa to save the life
of his lady love Andromeda.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#88:5>
Rasendyll is set, on the other hand, to assure that the throne will
not befall the evil hands of the king 's brother, Michael.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#89:5>
Perseus ' adventure is supernatural as he battles monsters and
befriends magical creatures, while Rasendyll 's is a &ldquo; cloak-and-dagger
&rdquo; battle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#90:5>
c. Perseus is an incidental hero.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#91:5>
Being a son of Zeus, he is assured a rather good life.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#92:5>
Zeus ' quarrel with Tethys spelled his quest to face one day
Callibus, the goddess ' son, and all these happen bec. of &ldquo; heaven 's
&rdquo; hands.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#93:5>
Rasendyll made the bold decision to play &ldquo; King &rdquo; and he
had the sole will to go which way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#94:5>
2. The movie adaptation is a rather &ldquo; artful &rdquo; and
faithful one precisely because it sticked to the novel 's course of events.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#95:5>
The narration provided depth to the film as it served as an <mention>
&ldquo; interior monologue &rdquo; </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#96:5>
If ever there were omissions & deletions, it still favors the goal of
the adaptation to sustain the subtlety of the actions in the novel. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#97:6>
1. a. Perseus the hero of <mention> &ldquo; Clash of the Titans
&rdquo; </mention> , and Rassendyll, hero of <mention> &ldquo; The Prisoner
of Zenda &rdquo; </mention> , both have heroic qualities such as bravery,
word of honor, code of duty as shown in their adventures.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#98:6>
The difference is that, Perseus is helped by the gods in facing his
herculean tasks, while Rassendyll is almost left on his own to fulfill his
adventure.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#99:6>
While both face difficult responsibilities and much is placed on
their backs ( life of Andromeda in Perseus, King 's fate and Ruritania 's
future in Rassendyll), they proved to be triumphant over these tasks, though
Perseus only did it through the help of the gods, while Rassendyll, on his
own strategies & bravery. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#100:6>
b. Both the heroes are courting danger to achieve their end - -
Perseus finds his way to Medusa to kill the creature of the sea ( Gorgon?) to
save Andromeda, and Rassendyll searches for the King and battles with Black
Michael and Rupert to preserve Rudolf the King 's reign.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#101:6>
Therefore their adventure is quite the same - savior-type plot,
although it 's obvious that Perseus is battling larger than life enemies,
while Rassendyll just faces human ( cunning, at that) enemies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#102:6>
c. Fate plays a large part in the two texts being compared.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#103:6>
Perhaps it is fate that brings Rassendyll at Ruritania at the right
time and place and be with the right people to save a kingdom and be a better
person.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#104:6>
So is it for Perseus, who was saved from his grandfather 's wicked
plan and emerge as savior of Andromeda.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#105:6>
However, since there is too much divine intervention in Perseus '
life, he is not that free to chart his own destiny, since the gods can easily
change the course of his life and play with his fate.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#106:6>
All Perseus has to do is follow the destiny set for him by the gods.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#107:6>
On the other hand, Rassendyll exhibits more free will because he can
decide to take part in the &ldquo; pretension", and choose to love or leave
Flavia alone.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#108:6>
Yet through Flavia, it is shown that one is really not too free to
decide for himself because there is a duty to follow and a responsibility to
fulfill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#109:6>
2. Using Gianetti 's category, <mention> Age of Innocence
</mention> is a faithful adaptation of the text.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#110:6>
The scenes in the book like the ball, opera, and many others are
shown in the film and little is taken out and combined like the scene where
Ellen asks what Newland will do while May is away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#111:6>
The details in the book are the exact things shown in the movie
like the <delete> arrangement </delete> setting in the ball and the manners
of the New Yorkers.

<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#112:6>
It doesn't go far from what is imagined while reading the book. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1A-017#113:6>
In fact, it could be also a literal adaptation since the lines
of the voice-over as well as that of the characters are the exact dialogue in
the book, although some were deleted to condense the film. </p> </I>
