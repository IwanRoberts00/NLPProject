In my college not yet <,,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#49:1:B>
But there 's their yearbook is already out

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#50:1:A>
Yeah and that 's in that part in that part we 're not really

<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#52:1:B>
I was really surprised because this is the first time they had their yearbook on time

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#53:1:A>
But their <.> year </.> yearbook is very cute
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#54:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#55:1:B>
Very cute

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#56:1:A>
Yeah it 's very small compared to other yearbooks
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#57:1:A>
But it 's good you know
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#58:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#60:1:B>
That 's why we want to release the yearbook during graduation day
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#61:1:B>
But I don't think we can do that anymore because of someone

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#62:1:A>
I really think <indig> ano </indig> Ritchie is very unfair you know

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#64:1:A>

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#245:1:A>
Really

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#246:1:B>

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#248:1:B>
No you 're the chatterbox

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#249:1:A>

<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#252:1:B>
That was in high school that was in high school <[> that 's different </[>  </{> 


 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#253:1:A>
 <[> I am quiet </[>  </{> I am quiet in my class
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#255:1:A>
My teacher in English can say that

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#256:1:B>
Oh

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#257:1:A>
I really don't talk I really don't talk that 's why I know <indig> na </indig> she 'll never give me that five bonus points 'cause I never talk

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#258:1:B>
You never talk but this is the proof that you talk

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#259:1:A>
This is the only proof this is our only proof <,> I mean when she when she asked me in in class sometimes I talk in one sentence I mean it 's the limit

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#260:1:B>
One sentence only

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#261:1:A>
 <indig> Ha </indig> you should see Reynolds he doesn't talk I mean when when my teacher in English class calls him <,> it 's as if he 's at a loss
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#262:1:A>
He 's always like that I mean my teacher looks at him <.> incredib </.> I mean incredulously
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#263:1:A>
But you know what my English teacher looks like my auntie you see she really looks like my auntie

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#264:1:B>
Really

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#265:1:A>
Yeah

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#266:1:B>
Do you have a demo

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#267:1:A>
When

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#268:1:B>
For your English class

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#269:1:A>
No
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#270:1:A>
She just wants us to submit the revised paper on April eight

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#271:1:B>
Uh uh uhm in our class we have

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#272:1:A>
Well she she told us <indig> na </indig> she 's implementing a different syllabus in our class

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#273:1:B>
Uh

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#274:1:A>
But you know it 's better <indig> pero </indig> it 's so slow 'cause when I proposed my thesis proposal this term <indig> ano </indig> I passed I passed it I passed the paper long before my teacher discussed about R R Land abstract 



<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#> That 's why I 'm at a loss

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#276:1:B>
You are at a loss

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#277:1:A>
At a loss
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#278:1:A>
So when so when my teacher in thesis <.> propos </.> in the thesis proposal asked me if I 'm going to propose that my proposal I declined
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#279:1:A>
Well when I look at my <.> propo </.> at my <.> re </.> review of related literature it looks like one whole paragraph then loose paper
 
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#280:1:A>
It was segmented to something it was divided into sections <indig> kaya </indig> I didn't know how to make <,,> 

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#281:1:B>
How to make

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#282:1:A>
An R R L alright then

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#283:1:B>
Oh I see

 <$A>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#284:1:A>

 <$B>  
<ICE-PHI:S1A-076#285:1:B>
