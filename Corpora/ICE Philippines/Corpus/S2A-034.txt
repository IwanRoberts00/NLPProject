<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#1:1:A>
Good afternoon everyone <&> audience greets the speaker </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#2:1:A>
Uhm I 'm actually scheduled to do I was supposed to read <unclear> 3 words </unclear> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#3:1:A>
For a monk who does not who should remain in a life of silence
I speak a great deal <&> audience laughs </&> especially on occasions when I 'm outside the monastery uh 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> So uh I actually prepared two lectures because they asked for <mention> A Question of Heroes </mention> and I felt it would be appropriate to deal with the the two major heroes Andres Bonifacio and Jose Rizal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#4:1:A>
Depends if we will have time for the second one
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#5:1:A>
Uhm I decided to speak first on Andres Bonifacio simply because eighteen ninety-seven is his centennial year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#6:1:A>
We are celebrating <.> Boni </.> we 're not supposed to celebrate it but uhm this is one reason why Bonifacio Centennial unlike Rizal last year there was such a lot of things going on re-enactment <unclear> word </unclear> stamps coins contests uhm even kite flying <&> audience laughs </&> and they had all sorts of things last year for Jose Rizal
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#7:1:A>
But for Andres Bonifacio we could not celebrate it uh simply because uh May ten eighteen ninety-seven a hundred years ago uh he was killed in the mountains of Maragondon Cavite by uh fellow Filipinos
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#8:1:A>
I mean uh with Rizal Rizal was killed by Spaniards that 's fine <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#9:1:A>
Uh Bonifacio was killed by fellow Filipinos that 's not it 's not something you want to remember uh but since uh we are dealing with uh history and I think if uh Pepe Diokno were alive he would 've liked to listen to something that we sweep under the rug and uh Bonifacio unfortunately is one of the heroes we like to remember but we only remember bits and pieces of him so the <?> history </?> you will hear this afternoon uh is kind of shocking in some parts 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> It is uh it is something I wish I did not see anymore and uh I would have been happy just dealing with what my teachers and my textbooks told me then
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#10:1:A>
Of course it is uh one of the tasks of a historian to present truth even if half the time that truth is not popular or might even be painful for people
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#11:1:A>
So uhm people usually assume uh that I spend most of my time researching in libraries or archives or <?> date matching </?> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> I 'm always at my desk which seems like an easy life
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#12:1:A>
I mean in my monastery for example some of the Brothers cannot understand why I spend half the day in front of my computer so for them they don't think it is quote unquote <mention> work </mention> because <mention> work </mention> means leaving at eight o'clock going to an office and coming back at five
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#13:1:A>
So if you sit in your room half the day reading uh half the time sleeping <&> audience laughs </&> uh actually I 'd rather think that is reflection <&> audience laughs </&> <indig> 'no </indig> uh or resting in the Lord but then uh the Brothers are not so keen on that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#14:1:A>
Uh what many people actually do not see is the heavy burden that responsible historians carry on their backs and even if we think eighteen ninety-six and eighteen ninety-eight something to be celebrated there is very much underneath the glorious trappings that is a very painful cancer to Filipinos who seriously look into their past
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#15:1:A>
Personally eighteen ninety-six is a very distressing part of our history and if I did not have the great misfortune of being both a historian and a journalist I would rather sweep it under a rug than talk about it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#16:1:A>
At the time Andres Bonifacio began the Philippine revolution in Balintawak in the latter part of August eighteen ninety-six because we 're still fighting over the dates uh little did he know that he would be swallowed up by the very revolution that he started
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#18:1:A>
This is the greatest irony of Andres Bonifacio
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#19:1:A>
Bonifacio was killed by the very revolution he started
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#20:1:A>
This is our first painful lesson for this afternoon
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#21:1:A>
Unless we come to terms with this part of our history we will never get anywhere and you remember the proverb <quote> <indig> ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggalingan tae ang maaapakan </indig> </quote> <&> audience laughs at the way the proverb has been twisted </&> or again as <unclear> words </unclear> <quote> in order to foretell the destiny of a nation one has first to open the book of her past </quote> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#23:1:A>
Now one of the main problems is that Philippine history is sadly written by rather dull and uh rather mediocre people <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#24:1:A>
We have uh many textbooks but we don't have interesting books of history
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#25:1:A>
Uhm if you go to a bookstore and this is not well uh my books are not very serious you don't have something that every interested <indig> Pinoy </indig> must know 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> All you have are these thick books with dates and names but the thing is history is not just this accumulation of data
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#26:1:A>
It must be presented in good and lively writing and it must give a point of view for without it history is a story without meaning
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#27:1:A>
One of the main problems facing Filipinos is our terribly short memory
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#28:1:A>
Uh the fact that Imelda and Imee Marcos sit in Congress is a very great proof of that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#29:1:A>
We have very little or no historical sense at all and it does not help that our historians cannot get their act together
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#30:1:A>
The end result is that Philippine history is often confused and confusing
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#31:1:A>
So this is one example
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#32:1:A>
Last year we had a roundtable discussion in the University of the Philippines
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#33:1:A>
Well I call it the <unclear> 2 words </unclear> <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#34:1:A>
Uhm we had this uh roundtable for a whole day in the hope of resolving this fifty-five year controversy of where and when the first cry of the revolution occurred
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#35:1:A>
Is it Balintawak or is it Pugadlawin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#36:1:A>
Is it August twenty-three eighteen ninety-six or August twenty-six eighteen ninety-six
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#37:1:A>
So I was invited to react to uh one of the papers presented on the forum because three years ago I wrote two essays on the thing and I could not resolve it either 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> And to be rather flippant I just teachers and students keep writing or interviewing me can you give us a definite answer 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> And I say you know just take out a coin toss it heads it 's Balintawak tails it 's Pugadlawin <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#38:1:A>
So the thing is they couldn't quite understand it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#39:1:A>
I think personally that the controversy is like the controversy of the first Mass
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#40:1:A>
Uh where was it held
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#41:1:A>
Was it in Limasawa or is it Masau Butuan
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#42:1:A>
And of course being a monk I think I should be interested in it but I always tell my students we shouldn't even discuss that at all
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#43:1:A>
It should be thrown in the <indig> basura </indig> and it shouldn't even be in textbooks at all because uh if you know what a galleon was like they were having Mass every day so we really do not know when this first Mass was held <&> audience laughs </&> and come to think of it so much precious time is wasted on something which is so uh well it 's important but it 's not very very important
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#44:1:A>
So anyway getting back to this roundtable conference we began at nine o'clock in the morning with only two options Balintawak or Pugadlawin
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#45:1:A>
By the time we adjourned at five in the afternoon we had more questions than answers <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#46:1:A>
As an added bonus we all left with a very big headache because at after from nine to five uh we started with Balintawak and Pugadlawin but we ended up with Bahay Toro Kangkong Pasong Tamo <unclear> words </unclear> Pugad ng Lawin and Pakpak Lawin <&> audience laughs </&> and <indig> ano pa </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#47:1:A>
And one of the light moments was when one of the scholars said it was <indig> Pugad Baboy </indig> <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#48:1:A>
So then uh it was not only that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#49:1:A>
So we started at nine o'clock with two things August twenty-three August twenty-six eighteen ninety-six that was before lunch
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#50:1:A>
By late afternoon we had the following dates August twenty twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six and to top it all someone even suggested a wild card in <unclear> 1 word </unclear> September <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#51:1:A>
I mean you know uh this did not faze me uh this was nothing new 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> Uh then somebody said uh since we can't settle that let 's settle something else they said 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> Somebody said uh why don't we figure out what Bonifacio shouted there <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#52:1:A>
And then uh then there was another debate there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#53:1:A>
So somebody said you know in Spanish it 's <foreign> grito de </foreign> Balintawak like <foreign> grito de </foreign> something in Mexico and Cuba so it is we shouldn't take it literally you know described so uh rather we should see it symbolically as the beginning of the <.> revol </.> revolution so it 's a figure of speech <foreign> etcetera etcetera </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#55:1:A>
So then later on what happened was somebody said there was no shout at all there were two shouts somebody said <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#56:1:A>
Somebody said there was one shout and then <indig> sige na </indig> let 's leave that <indig> na lang </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#57:1:A>
So let 's uh do other things <indig> na lang </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#58:1:A>
So uh after this so we talked about other things and then uh somebody he brought up what Bonifacio was like and uh uh we when you look at a statue of Bonifacio today what do you see
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#60:1:A>
You see him wearing a <foreign> kamisa de chino </foreign> that 's open here and you can see his muscular chest <&> audience laughs </&> and then uh he 's always with his red <indig> kundiman </indig> pants and then he 's holding a bolo and he 's always angry he 's always shouting or he 's mad or uh whatever
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#61:1:A>
Uh a few months ago I talked for example to the daughter of Gregoria de Jesus uh Bonifacio 's widow and then she said uh look at those <indig> kundiman </indig> pants and I said yes yes that 's what 's in all the statues and then she said you know adults do not wear <indig> kundiman </indig> pants only children wear those pants <&> audience laughs </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> And then she said you know and also the cloth of that it 's like something that you use for pillow cases <unclear> words </unclear> yes yes <unclear> words </unclear> and then she said something which which was striking and she said if you 're going to war will you wear bright red pants <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> And then I said no no you try your best to camouflage yourself you 're a moving target there 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#62:1:A>
So it occurred to me I started thinking of other things 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> Did he really fight with the bolo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#63:1:A>
Everyone is so upset now when I tell them that although he 's always brandishing his bolo Bonifacio never fought with the bolo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#64:1:A>
The preferred weapon was always a gun and the thing was when he went to uh Balintawak in August of eighteen ninety-six this scandalizes everyone he went to Balintawak dressed as a woman <&> audience laughs </&> because it was he could not pass through all the sentries so Andres Bonifacio tied his uh bandanna on his head and he wore a woman 's dress and of course he cannot travel in a woman 's dress carrying his big bolo <&> audience laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#66:1:A>
Uh so what he did was he kept the bolo in <unclear> place name </unclear> and brought his gun uh which is why uh we find out later that his preferred weapon was a bolo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#67:1:A>
So you see every day everywhere you will see images of Bonifacio which are historically inaccurate but then that is the image that we see in our textbooks in pictures in <foreign> plazas </foreign> in everywhere <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#68:1:A>
So uh what what really happened 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#> Then somebody talked about the tearing of the <foreign> cedula </foreign> <.> somebo </.> one scholar said there was this great uh triumphant tearing of the <foreign> cedula </foreign> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#69:1:A>
Somebody said there was no such thing maybe they didn't tear any <foreign> cedula </foreign> and then somebody said no there 's a source that says they tore their cedulas twice and I said how can you tear a <foreign> cedula </foreign> twice in three two different areas
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-034#72:1:A>
Uh people found that strange until later on I found a document that showed that Andres Bonifacio was using fake <foreign> cedulas </foreign> which means he probably had half a dozen on himself <&> audience laughs </&>
