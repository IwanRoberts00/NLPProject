RE: <h> Athletic facilities </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#7:1>
About two years ago, in anticipation of the opening of the PE and
Sports Building, the construction of the Administration Building, and the
closure of the large portion of the Chess Plaza, the Executive Vice President
called for a meeting with the PE Department, the Office of Sports
Development, and my office to come up with guidelines on areas of
responsibility for the various sports facilities affected by these structural
developments.

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#8:1>
These are basically what we agreed on: <O> table </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#9:1>
Outside of regular office hours, my office becomes in charge of
all these facilities by default. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#10:1>
For the use of the swimming pool, PE classes have priority over
all other groups.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#11:1>
Once the PE Dept., the OSD, and College of Saint Benilde have
determined their schedules for the regular use of the pool for the trimester,
control of the free schedules falls under my office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#12:1>
Though the OSD is in charge of the use of the Football Field,
they work closely with us in terms of schedule of activities there because my
office takes care of maintaining the condition of the soil and grass on the
field. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#13:1>
The Sports Plaza can be used as an activity area by any
legitimate group.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#14:1>
It is no longer exclusive to sports activities because it now serves
as an official student activity area in lieu of the section of the Chess
Plaza that was taken over by the ongoing construction work.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#15:1>
Maintenance of the basketball court and provision of the goal nets is
the responsibility of my office.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#16:1>
All other sports activities that will require additional equipment
should be held at the PE and Sports Building where such equipment may be
found.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#17:1>
Once the Administration Building is complete and the activity area
for the students has been restored, we can discuss again the use and control
of the Sports Plaza. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#18:1>
I hope these will give you the answers to some of the questions
brought to you with regard to the sports facilities. </p>

<p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#27:2>
To help ensure that none of you will be accused of stealing, in
case items get lost in the warehouse storage area, the guards at the STRC
gate have been instructed to conduct body search on all of you who will be
coming from the Warehouse.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#28:2>
This includes those whose offices are located at the Bloemen Hall and
those of you who may have visited the Warehouse area. </p>

RE: <h> Canteen suppliers </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#38:3>
It seems to be a normal practice for some of your suppliers to
hand over to our Security personnel a small portion of the items that they
deliver to you.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#39:3>
This practice has the following implications:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#40:3>
1. Though our Security personnel receive these items for free, the
costs are most likely borne by you and eventually by your consumers, the DLSU
community.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#41:3>
2. Though these may be simple gestures of kindness, they could also
be acts of bribery to gain favors from our Security personnel.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#42:3>
3. It may give the impression to our Security personnel and others
who benefit from the practice that, if tolerated, it is an acceptable
standard procedure.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#43:3>
Eventually this may become a requirement to all suppliers and an
atmosphere of corruption will be permanently in place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#44:3>
I have advised our Security personnel to stop accepting these
gratuities and I am asking for your assistance in strictly prohibiting <ul>
all of your suppliers </ul> from continuing the practice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#45:3>
As this is a serious concern of the Office of Administrative
Services, I look forward to your full cooperation. </p>

RE: <h> Warehouse Inventory Clerk </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#56:4>
In line with our effort to streamline job functions, I am
recommending the dissolution of the Inventory Clerk position at the Warehouse
Inventory and Monitoring Office ( WIMO).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#57:4>
The Director and the two remaining co-academic personnel - the
Warehouseman and Warehouse Clerk, will just absorb the functions of the
position. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#58:4>
Ms. Susan Ramas, the Inventory Clerk, will transfer to the
Purchasing Office to fill in the position of Office Messenger, a position
with the Central Purchasing Station ( CPS).

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#59:4>
In the event that the CPS reverts to their independent status under
the DLSU-System, we shall retain the Office Messenger position with our
Purchasing Office. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#60:4>
Unless you have any objections to my recommendation, I shall
effect the transfer of Ms. Ramas at the soonest possible time. </p>

RE: <h> Mr. Rodrigo Logmao, Jr. </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#71:5>
Mr. Logmao, who I transferred to the post of Elevator Operator,
has been missing work lately as a result of his high blood pressure.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#72:5>
I consulted Dr. Irmina Beltran about his condition and I was advised
that the movement of the elevator and the frequent change in altitude might
indeed not be good for Mr. Logmao 's health condition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#73:5>
As a consequence, may I ask for your assistance in having Mr.
Logmao reassigned to another job position that will not have any adverse
effect on his health?

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#74:5>
Should the reassignment be made possible, we would need a replacement
for Mr. Logmao. </p>

RE: <h> Lifeguard Uniforms </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#83:6>
For SY 2002-2003, beginning May 27, my office shall provide each
of you with 2 sets of lifeguard uniforms.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#84:6>
The primary intentions behind the provision of the uniforms, aside
from basic standardization, are:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#85:6>
1) to make you easily identifiable, especially in the pool area, and

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#86:6>
2) for you to have an attire which is conveniently removable in case
you need to immediately dive into the pool. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#87:6>
It is however expected that the uniforms will be:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#88:6>
1) worn properly and at all times you are on life-guarding duty
inside the PE and Sports Building, except on Sundays or other special
non-school days when you are only doing maintenance work on the pool;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#89:6>
2) maintained in its original form, <foreign> i.e. </foreign> , no
alterations in its design may be made;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#90:6>
3) kept in the Lifeguards ' Room at the PE and Sports Building when
not in use and that only one may be brought out to be laundered at any time;

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#91:6>
4) cared for as if these are your personal belongings and that any
damage to the uniforms should be immediately reported to the Building
Activities Coordinator. </p>

RE: <h> Relocation of furniture and equipment </h>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#107:7>
To ensure that proper procedures are followed with regard to the
permanent moving of furniture and equipment owned by the University, please
observe the following guidelines:

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#108:7>
1. Movement of office furniture or equipment from an office should
be accompanied by a documented request made by no less than the Office Head.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#109:7>
The Warehouse Disposition Form would, in most cases, take care of
this requirement.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#110:7>
2. All furniture or equipment located in &ldquo; public &rdquo; or
common areas, <foreign> e.g. </foreign> , corridors, conference rooms,
covered walks, <foreign> etc. </foreign> , should be assumed as properties of
the University in general.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#111:7>
Since such properties are under the care of Administrative Services,
by default, as the office head, my permission would be necessary to relocate
them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#112:7>
The movement of items normally used for functions or activities,
<foreign> e.g. </foreign> , chairs, tables, bulletin boards, <foreign> etc.
</foreign> , is not covered by this memo. </p>

Dear Mr. Gamboa:

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#142:10>
I should be the one responding to your letter to Mr. Roy
Faelnar, owner of Filtrex photocopying services, because it is my office that
is responsible for the arrangements with the photocopying services
concessionaire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#143:10>
A few months ago, my attention was already called about the
schedule of lunch breaks of the machine operators.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#144:10>
I then advised Mr. Faelnar to require the operators to take their
breaks in shifts.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#145:10>
They are trying to do this as much as possible, however, we also
have to consider that the operators cannot insist on their customers that
they have to go on a break at the middle of a job request or when there are
those in line waiting to be served.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#146:10>
Hence, what actually happens is that they take their breaks when
there are no more customers to attend to and therefore the time shifts can
hardly be followed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#147:10>
Anyway, I again asked Mr. Faelnar to remind the operators about
the need to take their breaks in shifts.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#148:10>
However, if the students would like to be assured that there is a
machine in operation at any time during the day, please advise them to
proceed to the Library.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#149:10>
Since there are a number of machines at close distances to each
other over there, the operators can easily coordinate among themselves as to
when they take their breaks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#150:10>
With regard to the installation of a photocopying machine at
the STRC Building, I regret to inform you that such may no longer be
possible.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#151:10>
The machine at the PE and Sports Building, which is supposed to
also serve the requirements at the STRC Building, is already an accommodation
that the concessionaire is extending to us because it is not even earning
enough to cover the cost of operation.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#152:10>
To add another unit at the STRC Building will already unfairly
overburden the concessionaire.

<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#153:10>
We hope the students will understand this limitation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W1B-025#154:10>
