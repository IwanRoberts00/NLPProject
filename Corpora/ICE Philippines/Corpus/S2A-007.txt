 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#1:1:A>
The Archers managing to survive a scare by the Blue Eagles at many occasions during the course of the first half

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#2:1:B>
Especially when Tenorio got into the ball game and scored with about eight points
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#3:1:B>
But unluckily for Ateneo Ateneo got into foul trouble and Fonacier has his own uh highlighting the first half 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#4:1:B>
But still Wilson and Ritualo I think they carried the load heavily for De La Salle while we 're still waiting for Rico Alvarez to sign on with three fouls to erupt in the second half

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#5:1:A>
But you know <,> definitely blue becomes you today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#6:1:A>
I must say that you were wise to wear blue here today

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#7:1:B>
<O> laughter </O> Oh yes I I 've to think about the uh situation of the <O> laughter </O> I have to blend with your group

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#8:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> Okay okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#9:1:A>
But uh this game is being fought so ferociously by both sides

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#10:1:B>
Uh uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#11:1:A>
The foul trouble might be the key and the free throw shooting might be the areas where it could spell the difference

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#12:1:B>
Oh <indig> sa </indig> free throw shooting for example Sev <indig> 'no </indig> it 's uh eighty-nine percent by La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#13:1:B>
They made seventeen points on nineteen tries while Ateneo only made ten out of eighteen from the free throw line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#14:1:B>
That could spell the difference
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#15:1:B>
Right now it 's the difference in the first half

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#16:1:A>
In terms of defense both have tried to draw the press 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#17:1:B>
Uh yeah

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#18:1:A>
Ateneo managed to break it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#19:1:A>
La Salle also managed to break it <indig> sino ang matibay ang resistensya </indig> might be also a difference here in the game

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#20:1:B>
Uh La Salle we 're looking at two point guards only for La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#21:1:B>
It 's uh Mike Cortez and Eric Arijola with matching Joseph Yong for uh De La Salle Cholo Villanueva the other rookie is not playing today
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#22:1:B>
For Ateneo L A Tenorio would certainly be the difference for Ateneo <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#23:1:B>
Ateneo is a different team without L A Tenorio I mean uh

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#24:1:A>
They do move a little better the fluidity is there

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#25:1:B>
Yes

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#26:1:A>
But they 're you 're so correct they are not the same team when Tenorio is down on the bench because of three personal fouls

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#27:1:B>
Yes
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#28:1:B>
Because they 're confident that Tenorio can bring down that leather unlike when they pressed Gimko and Tanchie there 's really a very good chance that they might lose the ball from the back court so if Tenorio uh watches his fouls and gets to play on the court majority of the second half I think Ateneo will be okay

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#30:1:A>
By the same token La Salle is a different team when Ritualo has to sit down on the bench
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#31:1:A>
We take a look at some of the significant numbers
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#32:1:A>
We take a <,> red ballpen you 're the teacher here also and we circle some important numbers my friend

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#34:1:B>
Well both of us uh belong to the academe Sev so <O> laughter </O> I don't have a monopoly of the title <mention> professor </mention> here <O> laughter </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#35:1:A>
Okay

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#36:1:B>
Thirty-six percent shooting for La Salle but today they atoned for that uh eighty-nine percent free throw shooting that 's actually fifty-six percent and eighty-nine percent free throw shooting
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#38:1:B>
Ateneo did better from the field but only shot ten of eighteen from the free throw line
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#39:1:B>
Ateneo had one rebound better but the turnovers it favored De La Salle forty turnovers committed by the Ateneo and only eight for De La Salle

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#40:1:A>
Jolly Paz we mentioned earlier was thinking about quickness the pace of the ballgame <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#41:1:A>
It looks like it does favor La Salle when it 's wide open court basketball that 's where Ritualo likes it and that 's where Tenorio <{> <[> likes it </[> but it 's just that he cannot stay on the floor for long

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#42:1:B>
<[> Oh </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#44:1:B>
Oh yes that 's that 's that 's correct Sev about uh about La Salle <indig> 'no </indig> they want open <.> baske </.> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#45:1:B>
They have the men to do that <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#46:1:B>
For Ateneo they 're just feeling it the strength of Ateneo is still Rich Alvarez <,> and Rico Villanueva
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#48:1:B>
Unfortunately Rainier has not yet hit his stride Membrere only Fonacier I recall and Tenorio has hit shots from the three-point area
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#49:1:B>
They need a lot more to free up the uh play offensively for Rico and Rich downstairs

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#50:1:A>
And just for the information of everybody I also brought a green shirt just in case 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> I knew that this was going to be the La Salle side <&> speaker B laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#51:1:A>
You also have your green shirt with you

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#52:1:B>
Oh yes uh just to make sure for insurance Sev

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#53:1:A>
In the meantime the uh Blue Babble Battalion is on the floor right now with their all-halftime <indig> palabas </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#54:1:A>
This is just getting better and better year after year

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#55:1:B>
Oh yes the way uh and some people say that we 're the only teams just La Salle and Ateneo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#56:1:B>
I hate to say we 're <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#57:1:A>
<indig> Wala e 'kala mo nagkuwentuhan lang 'no </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#58:1:B>
In fairness to our other members in the broadcast panel La Salle and Ateneo they 've stuck to the tradition of cheers while the other cheerers really you 're a the real cheer leader yourself Sev <unclear> words </unclear> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#59:1:A>
Long time ago

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#60:1:B>
But La Salle and Ateneo they 've stuck with the tradition of cheering and that 's what the U A A P is all about

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#61:1:A>
And the big thing that has developed here is because because these two universities which became co-educational some time in the seventies have now accepted that women are part definitely of the halftime <indig> palabas </indig> and I think rightfully so
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#62:1:A>
In fact the Ateneo <indig> palabas </indig> right now even has their grade school cheer leaders on the floor right now
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#63:1:A>
<{> <[> So it is the </[> whole uh community so to speak

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#64:1:B>
<[> <O> laughter </O> </[> </{> That 's right and uh it 's a good thing for Ateneo really to have the the women also participating in their cheering squad

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#67:1:A>
Okay and uh you 're very nice to me today I noticed
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#68:1:A>
In the uh meantime talking about community we have for the Ateneo Blue Eagles Patty Laurel with this Gentext update
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#69:1:A>
Take it away Patty <O> update from Patty </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#70:1:A>
Thanks a lot Patty and uh it is indeed up to the Ateneans to bounce back because La Salle they are not just going to give away this game and their championship
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#71:1:A>
They 're looking for number four
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#72:1:A>
No question about it

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#73:1:B>
They 're gonna work very hard for that and the same with Ateneo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#74:1:B>
Ateneo wanted to break into the championship <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#75:1:B>
They 've been in the Final Four for a couple of years now and you know this could be the big year for them
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#76:1:B>
And and I I 've anticipated you know <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#77:1:B>
We missed the La Salle Ateneo dream match-up last year
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#78:1:B>
F E U got in the way but so many teams wanted that and I think hard work would really be the the point for all the teams here in the sixty-fourth U A A P

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#79:1:A>
What are the other teams seeing here like U S T
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#80:1:A>
I see uh some players and some of the coaches from F E U and U S T
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#81:1:A>
What are they seeing here

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#82:1:B>
Well one it 's a different La Salle team that they 're looking at
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#83:1:B>
Uh it 's it 's becoming a Renren Ritualo show eighteen points for Renren Ritualo and I think that 's gonna be one factor that Franz Pumaren may be happy at this point but be unhappy later on because you have the countdown on Renren Ritualo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#84:1:B>
He <.> can </.> can't score eighteen points <indig> 'no </indig> La Salle would not want him to do that
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#85:1:B>
For Ateneo it 's becoming terrible for the other teams because they now have the last piece of the puzzle which is a point guard <indig> 'no </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#86:1:B>
It 's just a matter of time before Rico and Rich Alvarez combine together and really make the <,> defense very difficult against Ateneo because he 's gonna <,> scatter the entire defense 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> We have the outside game of Tenorio and uh and Rainier Sison complementing Alvarez Boguia and uh Villanueva inside

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#87:1:A>
That 's three and four positions seems to be at <.> At </.> Ateneo 's advantage in this game at the point 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> And at the four position La Salle seems to have the clear edge in the game at least if we take out Tenorio from the equation of course

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#88:1:B>
Yes of course but uh Tenorio 's part of the equation
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#89:1:B>
We could only take him out if he has more than uh if he commits his fifth foul or fourth foul early in the third period
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#90:1:B>
But <,> Ateneo would need to start Tenorio in the third quarter <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#91:1:B>
It 's very pivotal for Ateneo but of course Tenorio would have to watch out <indig> 'no </indig> he wanted an exciting ball game 'till the end Sev

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#92:1:A>
And our full schedule of games we will be presenting majority of the games in the course of the U A A P season and I 'm sure the other teams will see this is the level not just because it 's Ateneo and La Salle but the level in which they must play to be able to go up against these two teams <O> noise </O> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#93:1:B>
It 's clear they 're watching the game between La Salle and Ateneo 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> Of course everybody every team in the U A A P wants La Salle 's head 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> They 're the defending champions they don't want to make another uh occasion wherein U S T in the nineties bagged the four consecutive championships
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#95:1:B>
The rest of the teams they don't want that to happen to La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#96:1:B>
Of course La Salle wanted it
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#97:1:B>
For Ateneo it 's been a long time since eighty-seven and eighty-eight for Danny and company that they wanted

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#98:1:A>
I wonder who the center of that team was as <&> speaker B laughs </&> you take a look at director Fritz Infante who uh helped direct our opening <indig> palabas </indig> also and there of course well Ateneo La Salle
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#100:1:A>
He 's on the La Salle side of the the floor
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#101:1:A>
But you 're right about the other aspect uh the big alumni so to speak <indig> yung mga </indig> in government politics and business they 're all around and all the pretty girls from a different time a different era <&> speaker B laughs </&> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#102:1:A>
My classmates are here they they 're my batch from high school seventy-four <,> they said uh to kill you but I said you 're a nice guy really but you know uh they said uh can you at least try

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#103:1:B>
I have an Atenean father so <O> laughter </O> he 's high school fifty-four partner

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#104:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> So that neutralizes the whole thing okay
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#105:1:A>
I told you he 's a very nice guy
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#106:1:A>
In the meantime <O> chuckle </O> forty-seven the Bob Novales formula say the score when you 're too happy forty-seven to forty-one <O> laughter </O> is is the count as we begin the second half of play
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#107:1:A>
we are so glad you could join all of us here today in this very special presentation on Studio twenty-three U A A P sixty-fourth season second day of competition
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#108:1:A>
Yes I believe we have to jump again <O> noise </O> Wow tall line-up together with Cortez and Ritualo
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#109:1:A>
Ritualo circles around a huge pick by Ramos finds himself open gets a good look unable to sink it <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> Even Renren Ritualo in a pre-season interview said <indig> nag-iiba din ang laro niya 'pag Ateneo La Salle </indig> 

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#110:1:B>
Oh yes <indig> ibang-iba yung </indig> level

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#111:1:A>
That was a plain steal Ritualo is gone

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#112:1:B>
Any markers for Renren Ritualo <O> noise </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#113:1:A>
And that was sort of expected when you have Ritualo if you can bottle him up maybe it will help your cause
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#114:1:A>
In the meantime here comes Membrere across the time line applies the breaks
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#115:1:A>
Sison sends it over to uh Tenorio
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#116:1:A>
In the meantime Rico Villanueva got a foul

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#117:1:B>
From Santa Maria doubling up on Rico Villanueva <O> noise </O> third foul on uh Adonis

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#118:1:A>
And that 's a clear Smart Zed steal Smart Zed the power to live the life you choose
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#119:1:A>
Smart Zed your telephone now <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#120:1:A>
It 's Enrico Villanueva outside to Membrere <unclear> 1 word </unclear> connection with Tenorio there
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#121:1:A>
In the meantime there 's a foul 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> La Salle will have another and that is on Michael Reyno

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#122:1:B>
Second team foul now for uh La Salle <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#123:1:B>
It' s a difficult match-up for Vainio he 's covering uh Rainier Sison
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#124:1:B>
Vainio used to play the <?> foreign </?> five in high school but he has to contend with somebody like Rainier Sison 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#125:1:B>
<{> <[> And from the outside </[> he moves very well from the outside

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#126:1:A>
<[> <indig> Na magalaw </indig> </[> </{> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> <indig> Oo oo </indig> <,> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#127:1:A>
There 's Alvarez altering his pace drives hard loses his control of the ball <,,> Santa Maria was not exactly going to give him an open lane
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#128:1:A>
But look at this Tenorio with a heist up up up and away

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#129:1:B>
That 's gonna make Cortez think about dribbling in front of Tenorio <O> noise </O> 

 <$A> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#131:1:A>
Tenorio may be feeling right now I 'm on a bit of borrowed time and the coaching staff I 'm sure told him <indig> huwag kang susundot pag alanganin </indig> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#132:1:A>
Cortez managing to get it to Santa Maria
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#133:1:A>
Santa Maria starts his drive to the basket blocked by Villanueva but there 's a foul prior to that block
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#134:1:A>
Ouch we missed George during halftime
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#135:1:A>
Now we would get an opportunity to chat with George in this Gentext update <O> update from George </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#136:1:A>
Excellent report uh George and of course I 'm not surprised that La Salle is a bit worried about what Tenorio can do as far as damage to their cause is concerned

 <$B> 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#137:1:B>
If La Salle doesn't figure it out he could be this big in his first game in the U A A P <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#138:1:B>
Here 's Rich Alvarez seeing his wide opening unable to fill in that gap decides to slow down Membrere switches it over to Tenorio who cuts up the inside but to no avail <O> noise </O> 
 
<ICE-PHI:S2A-007#> Rico Villanueva can't get to it he 's beaten to the punch that time by Ramos 

 </I>
