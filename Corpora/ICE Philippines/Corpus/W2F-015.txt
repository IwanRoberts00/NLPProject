<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#3:1>
Father?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#4:1>


<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#5:1>
I went out riding last night. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#6:1>
Don't be angry with me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#7:1>
I know I 'm not supposed to go out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#8:1>
But I got my chance when Malach forgot to shut the gates and I wasn't
about to let it pass.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#9:1>
I had never been out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#10:1>
Ever since I was born, I 'd been asking, wondering about the other
side of those Walls.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#11:1>
I 'm eighteen now, old enough to go beyond wondering, and this huge
city can't keep me safe anymore. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#12:1>
Are the only people in the world the people around me, Father?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#13:1>
That 's a good question.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#14:1>
Even Dantriu the scholar thought so, when first asked it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#15:1>
I was twelve.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#16:1>
He said I was a precocious child.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#17:1>
So it shouldn't be any wonder I have to find things out for myself,
even the hard way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#18:1>
Please come out and greet me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#19:1>
I 've taken too long to return home.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#20:1>
I miss you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#21:1>
Yes, I did steal <mention> Golden </mention> .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#22:1>
Are you punishing me for that?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#23:1>
But I had to steal her, because I knew you wouldn't give her to me if
I said I was to take her out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#24:1>
<mention> Golden </mention> has never been out of the Kingdom either.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#25:1>
She was the one who often looked up and tried to peer at the sky
outside ours.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#26:1>
But of course she couldn't do that because the Walls were too tall.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#27:1>
We shared a curiosity.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#28:1>
She had to be the one I would bring out.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#29:1>
I could have taken <mention> Stealth </mention> , because he was much
faster and stronger, but he wouldn't have liked the change of view. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#30:1>
It was early nighttime.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#31:1>
I didn't stop to think.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#32:1>
I just leapt on <mention> Golden </mention> and showed her where to
break through.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#33:1>
After that, I roved without a road.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#34:1>
But the moon was bright over the wilderness, I wasn't lost. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#35:1>
Oh, the moon. .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#36:1>
You had never told me how beautiful the moon is, Father, the moon
over the bleak horizon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#37:1>
I 'd never seen it down so low.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#38:1>
It had always been high up, if it was in the sky at all, passing from
one edge of the Walls to another.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#39:1>
Always beyond reach.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#40:1>
Outside, when I saw the moon again, Father, it was down so low I felt
I could ride out to where it lay and snatch it out of the darkness.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#41:1>
Mother would like the moon for her necklace, I thought, and you would
like it for your crown. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#42:1>
I spurred <mention> Golden </mention> on to chase the moon.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#43:1>
The moon fled.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#44:1>
We must have been a splendid sight, <mention> Golden </mention> and I
speeding across the barren plain.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#45:1>
I should not wonder that the moon eluded our reach more out of
jealousy than fear.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#46:1>
Coyness only made it more alluring, as it does to women, as you 've
said so yourself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#47:1>
We became masters of the night, <mention> Golden </mention> and
I. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#48:1>
How far from the Walls did we go?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#49:1>
I didn't keep track.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#50:1>
There was too much nothingness to see, a broad emptiness to bore me
so easily.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#51:1>
The Kingdom is often crowded, as you no doubt know, and I have grown
sick of it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#52:1>
It was so silent out, so peaceful. .

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#53:1>
And where were the ghosts?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#54:1>
When I was a child, you warned me that the Walls had been built to
keep the ghosts from bothering the citizens.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#55:1>
There were no ghosts in the wilderness, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#56:1>
There was none... nothing at all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#57:1>
There was nothing until we reached the sea--the first sea that I
had ever laid eyes on.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#58:1>
And then there was the water and the moon, and the moon 's
reflection, all going into forever.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#59:1>
Funny, no matter how your scholars tried to explain it to me, I 'd
never understood forever--until last night, when I saw the sea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#60:1>
The waves crashed and wailed as the wind whipped through them.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#61:1>
There was so much wind I felt like I was going to get blown away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#62:1>
And <mention> Golden </mention> inched back hesitantly from the
water, as if gently pushed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#63:1>
With her gleaming mane flying, <mention> Golden </mention> looked a
marvelous creature indeed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#64:1>
We should have wind in this kingdom, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#65:1>
Order some from Malach 's boys, when next they go trekking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#66:1>
I got off <mention> Golden </mention> and eased myself into the
sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#67:1>
I wanted to feel the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#68:1>
I wanted to know if the salt smell in the air was a trail of
something that truly existed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#69:1>
Imagine forever full of such valuable stuff!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#70:1>
I waded, the water lapping at my ankles.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#71:1>
And then I bent down for a sip.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#72:1>
And do you know, Father, what I saw?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#73:1>
As I bent down, something moved upward.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#74:1>
From the sand.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#75:1>
The water must have cleared it of its cover of rotten seaweed.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#76:1>
It was what was left of a face, a human face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#77:1>
Its mouth was open so wide its jaws were about to fall apart. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#78:1>
I fell back, gagging.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#79:1>
I 've never before seen anyone die screaming, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#80:1>
Imagine that: eighteen years old and nary a taste or touch of malice.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#81:1>
Highly improper.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#82:1>
Maybe fate truly meant for me to watch the sea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#83:1>
For that wasn't all that I saw.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#84:1>
Father, the face looked at me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#85:1>
At me!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#86:1>
As if I had been the one that had killed it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#87:1>
And when I stepped away I stumbled upon another body almost entirely
buried in the sand--a woman this time, a wizened little thing, frozen for
eternity in a similar state of madness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#88:1>
<mention> Golden </mention> had trodden upon something soft.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#89:1>
She panicked and I had to hold her down.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#90:1>
When I looked down I saw that she had encountered a human hand,
bleached by salt and blotched with the seasons, but whole.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#91:1>
When <mention> Golden </mention> had stepped on it, it had cracked
and had become bent at an unsightly angle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#92:1>
Beneath the sand beneath me, I knew, there were hundreds more of
such atrocities, perhaps even worse than the ones that I had seen.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#93:1>
I stayed, unable to conceive of the cause of such a tragedy, and
until I found out enough to tell you, I could not leave. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#94:1>
But <mention> Golden </mention> was anxious.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#95:1>
She was whinnying pitifully.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#96:1>
The least I could do for the poor creature was to lead her a short
way from the shore.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#97:1>
There were still a few bodies there, but not quite as many as there
were by the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#98:1>
It was almost as if - - well, it may sound strange, but it was almost
as if those people had died trying to reach the sea; fleeing from something.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#99:1>
And what could they have done if they had reached the sea, jumped in
and swam all the way to nonexistent other shores?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#100:1>
What could they have been running from that was so terrible they
preferred death by drowning to being trapped away from the sea? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#101:1>
I tied <mention> Golden </mention> to a piece of something
sticking out of the rocks.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#102:1>
It looked sturdy enough to hold even a frightened mare.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#103:1>
I stayed beside her for a while, soothing her, before she felt safe
enough to be left alone.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#104:1>
Then I went back to the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#105:1>
I tried not to see the faces all about me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#106:1>
I tried to feel sad.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#107:1>
All those poor people deserved the tears of the entire Kingdom, but
they would have to make do with what I had to offer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#108:1>
You see, even without your patronage, I was a good child,
Father. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#109:1>
Please come out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#110:1>
Anyway, it 's your loss.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#111:1>
You 're missing a very good story.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#112:1>
This really happened, Father; you must know, if there has ever been
one virtue I learned from Mother and you, it 's to be honest about every
story I tell.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#113:1>
The moon was as beautiful as I have just described it, and the sea
as mystical.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#114:1>
And the gnawing in my heart... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#115:1>
I went back to the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#116:1>
It and Death had an attraction for me that was certainly magical.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#117:1>
Neither was as terrible as your scholars had described them, though
all my life I had been taught to fear things that I could not understand.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#118:1>
Until then, I had never seen the sea, or felt a million agonies
trembling underneath me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#119:1>
As I stood there, facing eternity, a lonely man, I felt and thought:
everyone behind the Walls should see this wonder now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#120:1>
And then a marvelous thing happened: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#121:1>
I understood why those people had chosen the sea as their last
refuge from the vast Unknown. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#122:1>
No, there were no ghosts.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#123:1>
You could not tell me that again now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#124:1>
It wasn't a ghost I saw, rising from the water, out from the very
deep part where nothing could possibly walk on the uneasy ocean surface.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#125:1>
At first I thought it was just some object, maybe a stray boat, or a
log, like the pretty things you see bobbing up and down in the perfumed
streams of the Kingdom.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#126:1>
But then it wouldn't sink, though the waves rose high as if to
swallow it whole. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#127:1>
It was so far I still had time to run.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#128:1>
But I didn't run.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#129:1>
I wanted to see if it was a ghost, as you have always been telling
me, as everyone has always been telling me, and I wanted to see what would
happen if I defied you and everyone and just stayed there.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#130:1>
And if I talked to it, maybe.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#131:1>
So I could come back, if I could come back at all, and tell everyone
that I had spoken with a ghost, and then not mind when no one would listen,
because it would have been the truth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#132:1>
The thing came closer toward me, until I could see by the light
of the moon that it was a human form.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#133:1>
It was a woman dressed in rags, with skin as white as ivory, rough
and half-eaten away by the strong evening tide and time.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#134:1>
Her sparse hair was long and so light it whipped violently around
what was left of her face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#135:1>
Such a beautiful face.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#136:1>
Her eyes, I imagined, must have been the color of the night sky.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#137:1>
Something stared out at me from out those empty sockets on her
face, and held me where I was, until she came closer.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#138:1>
She did not step onto the shore.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#139:1>
Out on the water, she stood, rigid as a pillar, yet constantly
moving, as though she were made of dust.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#140:1>
The waves played tricks with her image.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#141:1>
I did not know if she was friend or foe, and so I did not draw my
sword. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#142:1>
<quote> &ldquo; You have come to us, &rdquo; </quote> she said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#143:1>
Father, she could speak! </p> </p>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#144:1>
In a voice as deep and quiet as the very bottom of the sea, she told
me, <quote> &ldquo; There is something we must show you. &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#145:1>
She held out a bony hand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#146:1>
All of a sudden, all around her, many other people started
rising from their watery beds.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#147:1>
As if they had been lying in wait there for a long, long time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#148:1>
<quote> &ldquo; Something you must see, &rdquo; </quote> the
woman said beckoning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#149:1>
Now I would know, Father, if she was a ghost, if I would touch
her hand and die with the cold.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#150:1>
You had told me that yourself, you and the scholars.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#151:1>
Ghosts have strange magic.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#152:1>
They could even take a person 's soul. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#153:1>
I waded out into the water to stand before her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#154:1>
Suddenly I was chest-deep in the murkiness and looking up.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#155:1>
I waved my arms in the water beneath her feet, and realized she
stood upon nothing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#156:1>
I had to stretch my hand up to meet hers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#157:1>
And it was not cold at all, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#158:1>
Not even when she held me and took me down into the water.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#159:1>
It was not cold at all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#160:1>
My last thought, was that I had never been so far from home.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#161:1>
Father?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#162:1>


<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#163:1>
I had not wanted to be gone long.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#164:1>
But they had to tell me so much.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#165:1>
I know it all now, because I stayed long enough. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#166:1>
The ones under the water were not ghosts, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#167:1>
They were people.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#168:1>
They were survivors.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#169:1>
You see, something dreadful happened to the world.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#170:1>
Not just some time ago, it is more like a long time ago, because it
happened before the building of the Walls.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#171:1>
There were no real Walls back then: people could meet people
everywhere else.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#172:1>
All the myths were shattered, and all legends disproved by magic of
a force so brutal it was a stronger than the magic we have now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#173:1>
It was a strong magic, to create - - and to destroy - - at the
command of a single man.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#174:1>
He was a powerful man.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#175:1>
But he was foolish. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#176:1>
Am I making sense?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#177:1>
I 'm sorry, there is just too much to tell.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#178:1>
There really are vast differences within heaven, hell and everything
in between, which was the prime knowledge of the people of the sea.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#179:1>
They gave even that to me.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#180:1>
They said they would not deny me anything.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#181:1>
I was, after all, a great descendant of the greatest man who had
lived on earth, who had the power to create and destroy by whim - - and to
prevent both, also by his whim. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#182:1>
Did you ever know him, Father? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#183:1>
They said he looked exactly like you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#184:1>
Please come out... I want to see if that is true.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#185:1>
He was your grandfather, and the father of the one who built the
Kingdom and the Walls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#186:1>
All the time they spent trying to describe his hateful face to
me, I kept remembering the brightness of your smile.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#187:1>
And the way you laughed aloud whenever the jesters sang.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#188:1>
And your strong voice and its softness when it fell on Mother 's
loving ears.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#189:1>
You have always been the hero, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#190:1>
I could not think how you could resemble such a monster. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#191:1>
Yet I could not deny their loathing, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#192:1>
I do not know what magic that old demon must have used to broadcast
bitterness upon waters that flowed in and out of forever.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#193:1>
And while I languished in those waters, I felt, breathed, lived the
bitterness, it ate the younger part of me away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#194:1>
I want to see you.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#195:1>
I want you to see me now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#196:1>
I must be your age.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#197:1>
No - - older.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#198:1>
No... older even than that!

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#199:1>
I must be the same age as the man who killed the world outside the
Walls, and I can recognize him now when I look upon his face. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#200:1>
You really can't run away.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#201:1>
You must know that by now.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#202:1>
You could try hiding in the ruins of the Kingdom, that phony
Paradise.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#203:1>
In a sense, the ruins are more beautiful than what once was.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#204:1>
They are, at least, more truthful.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#205:1>
And I have to be thanked for that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#206:1>
The citizens don't deserve to live.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#207:1>
None of us do.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#208:1>
We survived the fury of the holocaust that had invented the world
because of the very same man who had caused it.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#209:1>
We are cowards, we have always been.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#210:1>
Yes, indeed, you don't prove anything by belonging to a different
generation.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#211:1>
Someone has to pay for his father 's sins. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#212:1>
Mother--Mother?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#213:1>
Where is she, Father?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#214:1>
Do you know?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#215:1>
You had her under the ground only a few years ago.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#216:1>
Can you look in the same spot and find her there now?

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#217:1>
Well, I 'll just tell you where to find her.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#218:1>
She 's down there with them, with everyone else.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#219:1>
At the bottom of eternity, resting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#220:1>
She belongs there, Father.

<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#221:1>
Everyone belongs there now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-PHI:W2F-015#222:1>
Down there, where it isn't cold, and where they don't believe in
walls. </p> </I>
